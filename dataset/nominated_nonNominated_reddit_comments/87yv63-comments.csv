But dammit, I've missed this Spielberg for so long. We sort of got it with Tintin, but this is the shamelessly sentimental, adventure loving Spielberg I grew up on, and the one that really made me love film. It's a fucking blast, and I absolutely loved it.

So incredibly fun to see Spielberg dip into *his* inner fanboy and pay tribute to his former mentor with such a detailed recreation of the Overlook and Room 237. The images were so clear as well!

dwgwqai,"I think the thing this movie lacked most was the feeling of time. In the book sometimes months or a year would go by in between finding a clue or gaining a key. And in that time a lot of character and relationship building happens, that you just lose in the film. Having Wade tell Artemis he loved her basically their first date was just a little cringey for me. I wanted to see them build their relationship, see him get dumped, see him try to redeem himself within the IOI system and then they finally meet in the real world. Time is what I feel the movie was missing.",87yv63

I came in having ready the book and really enjoyed it BECAUSE of the differences. I still got to see all my favorite characters and lots of references but it was different enough from the book to keep it fresh.

Enjoyed the soundtrack of course. The references were on point from pop culture. CGI was not at any point piss poor because it’s a game and it’s chill if it looks like a game, but even then nothing fell short!

I can’t say how much I loved The Shining movie point. My favorite part of the movie! AND THE MECH FIGHT! If the mech fight wasn’t in there then I would have rioted, but it was there and I loved it.

This is far from a perfect film, but holy shit the passion behind the camera is absolutely intoxicating. This is fucking over 70 year old Steven Spielberg still treating us to something modern movies don't do enough of, which is that beautiful feeling of childhood imagination.

It's disappointing how many people are missing that as an intention, and instead resorting to nitpicking at every little detail or getting caught up in references.",87yv63

dwhshzu,"I liked it. Definitely is it's own thing compared to the book. The romance between Parzival and Art3mis felt way, way too rushed but maybe that's just because it seemed like a slower build up and we got Wade's internal dialogue in the book which eased us into the relationship much better. 

It's also a tiny thing, I admit, but Goldeneye being Halliday's favorite game felt way out of place compared to the rest of the references Halliday pulls from.",87yv63

dwrsx33,"I thought the book was alright, but I thought the movie was awful. It’s got a lot of references, but the plot itself felt very shallow. 

The Cons:

My biggest complaint was how easy the challenges were. It’s been 5 years and you expect me to believe NOONE thought to drive backwards??? The plot of this movie revolves around how difficult finding the egg was, but if this happened in real life it would have been solved in a week tops.

Aside from Parzival himself being fairly unlikable (better than book version at least), TJ Miller’s character was the worst one in the movie. This is ignoring my personal opinions on him, but his comedy felt oddly placed, and in a world where you can be whoever you want and you choose a badass assassin, why would you pick his voice?

The final complaint I’ll mention is how little of the real world is shown. IIRC, in the book pretty much everything is done in the Oasis: work, school, etc. So when Parzival goes into the real world, and sneaks into the IOI headquarters, it was really interesting to see how the rest of the world worked.

The Pros:

Halladays journals were cool and done better than in the book imo. However, the curator being Ogden makes very little sense to me. Halladay himself was pretty interesting, but I was left wanting more of him (that final scene with him was pretty good). 

The Shining Scene was awesome, it was so fucking cool, my favorite part of the movie for sure.

The final battle was pretty awesome, just wish they had used og Mecha Godzilla. 

Overall: 5/10, however I DO recommend it, because even though I disliked it, it’s hard to deny that it wasn’t entertaining.

dwlpvni,"Very fun movie with cringy parts scattered around- just like the book.

I thought it was hilarious when they showed the real life sections when people got killed- he shoots a rail gun and a line of people IRL turn red. And explosion goes off and a circle of people IRL turn red. 

There's a weird mapping of real life and the Oasis- especially when people wearing the headsets are running down a street in real life in the same formation as they are in the game. ",87yv63
e1zzp7r,"Am I the only one who couldn't get past the fact that literally half a trillion dollars was on the line, and nobody ever thought that the super weird aspergers guy (whose personality was known due to fame AND the fact that his entire life was kept on archive) who made public his love for outside the box thinking would do something unexpected for the challenges, like drive backwards? And nobody found that, even by accident, in YEARS? If it's a trillion dollars on the line then you pay people to start shouting memes at King Kong or do a barrel roll 42 times or some shit until you figure it out. Especially when you're a company with thousands of employees, where zeroing out is meaningless.

Even once they figure out that the race was meant to be ""more than just winning"" they try to brute force ""win"" the rest of the challenges. I mean, if you google searched that last game it would tell you in 10 seconds that it contains the first Easter egg and how to get it. Nobody thought the guy hiding the Easter egg might be interested in the first Easter egg? 

I can suspend my disbelief but this movie just seemed to really make Wade into a ""creative genius"" for coming up with things that would likely have been tested day one in real life. ",87yv63
e21lev7,"There was a couple of disjointing moments in the movie, I wonder how many things were left on the cutting room floor, either because of budget concerns with so much being CGI or just trying to choose a direction to go in.

Something that stood out to me was when the Aunt died he just upped and turn around and walked away. Didn't try and find her, just accepted it and went to find the girl lol.

It was pretty immersive, and granted while there's alot that you have to leave to suspension of belief, and some pretty terrible lack of character development, I think it was a pretty decent movie. ",87yv63

Overcoming extreme poverty to obtain the first key. Parzival was so poor he was stuck on school planet.

IOI taking the lead on the leaderboard, right when our hero is already depressed from lovesickness. There should be a point in the movie that all hope is gone and you think your friends have betrayed you.

Something should have happened to engage everyone personally to see IOI as the enemy, not just a competitor. The rallying cry of the high 5 felt weak somehow.",87yv63
dwhqfhn,"That extended tribute to *The Shining* put the biggest dumb grin on my face. It caught me completely off-guard. They went to such loving lengths to recreate Kubrick's aesthetic, and Aech fumbling around not knowing any of the scares we know will get her was a brilliant move to reward the audience for having some basic geeky knowledge. Makes me wish the whole movie was made up of direct tributes rather than non-specific cities and ice planets.  
As for the rest of *Ready Player One*; Spielberg always seems to make me forget I'm watching a movie and just take me for a ride. He did it again here, yet I can't feeling that, for the first half of the film, he was oddly off his game.  
Here's an example: there's a point in the movie where Samantha pulls Wade into a room to get him into a disguise. She holds up a suit, he says ""I'm not wearing that,"" then cut to Wade wearing the suit. They're obviously trying to get a laugh, yet the Thursday preview crowd I was watching with didn't emit a single giggle. Maybe it's because we've seen that gag done a million times, or that it doesn't make sense for Wade to refuse the suit in the first place. Regardless, it doesn't work, and the whole first hour feels peppered with these moments that fall flat on their face. Combined with the cookie-cutter characters, cliche Spielbergisms, and superficial take on the impact an in-depth VR world would have on people's lives, it couldn't help feeling oddly hollow.  
The most off-putting thing to me was the tacked-on moral at the end. I appreciate they're making an effort to communicate a healthy message to the droves of internet addicts that'll see the movie, but it's completely inconsistent with everything we just watched. Sure, Halliday was depressed, but Wade got to have crazy intense car races, fight mecha-godzilla, wander around a perfect recreation of the Overlook Hotel, make four awesome best friends, find true love, and go from slumdog to billionaire all from the comfort of his VR set -- and now you're telling me to play *less* video games?",87yv63

Also there's so many plot holes, inconsistencies and stuff that I wish they would have fleshed out.

Like Artemis says ""Welcome to the Rebellion"" and you see a few other people in there with her but they don't do anything, we never see their in-game avatars, what role they play, or even what exactly they're rebelling against.

And how exactly does IOI make money in the Oasis? I assume they make some stuff in the real world (were they the ones who made those full body suits?) Also what is the purpose of having people work off their debt in the Oasis as what are essentially slaves (why is that even legal? Is there some law in the future that allows that.

There's more too, why are people out in the street with their headsets on, if H and Z are best friends why didn't he know she was a girl, what are the chances that in the game that everyone in the world plays all of them happen to live in the same city, does the curator guy just in game constantly waiting for people to come in to the musuem etc.

dwgnjr4,"As one of the few people on reddit who seems to have enjoyed the original book it was ok. 

The Shining scene was the standout set piece and best new addition to the material (loved how they played with the horror elements there to not just make it a straight gamers adventure like the rest of the movie). I also liked how they used Halliday's memories to set up the backstory of his life and parallel it to Wade's own journey. 

Problem with the movie was character. In the book Parzival actually has a clear arc. He starts off as a loner who loathes his life in the real world and uses the Oasis as escapism (see modern internet addiction). In the Oasis he has one friend, Aech, who he idolizes because he always has the best/fanciest stuff, and he can escape his dreary trailer park tower life. 

Then he finds the first key and his life changes - he gets corrupted by the celebrity and attention and treats old and new friends like Art3mis poorly. In this distraction he loses focus and his friends, then falls behind on the discovering 2nd key. At his lowest point in his arc he accidentally discovers a hidden game where he earns his ""extra life"" quarter. 

He then leaves the Oasis to focus on improving himself in the real world: getting in shape, infiltrating (yea unlikely but w/e) the evil company, and preparing for the last battle. He uses his extra life and deep understanding of Halliday's similar loneliness and difficulty in fitting in to the real world to win the great game... and the book ends with him not wanting to return to the Oasis for the first time but to spend more time with Samantha in the real world. 

So, pretty simple and effective story arc.  

The movie hits many of the same marks but makes one big, big mistake. Wade meets Samantha in the real world way too soon (literally in the middle of the movie where she has a random thug to ""rescue"" him) and it just kills all the momentum the film had been building to that point dead. By Wade knowing and accepting Samantha in the real world that early it COMPLETELY kills his arc to that point. He has no where left to grow in the rest of the movie and it's mainly generic action beats of saving the girl and his friends and the world etc. 

In addition, the film failed in setting up it's overall theme in other ways. Aech in the book is infamously a good looking white guy as a disguise in Oasis and gay black woman in the real world. It's meant to be the first time it hits Wade that Oasis is a fantastic lie... but real relationships matter anyway. Here Aech is... a black orc in Oasis? And it has zero impact on Wade when it turns out it's a black woman who is maybe gay. Same with the 11 year old Chinese kid. It's played for goofy laughs here and robs those revelations of any real impact. 

Ultimately it was fine but missed the chance to really capture the cultural zeitgeist of the moment where we are seriously re-examining the power that the internet and large data companies are having on our lives and is just a thinly plotted summer spectacle released in the spring. My screening ended with a tepid opening audience applause and that about sums it up for me. ",87yv63

dwjlavq,"I would give it a solid 7 out of 10. The OASIS parts, cinematography and character cameos were enjoyable. The real world parts and rushed plot/character relationships were the weaker parts of the film. 

The film also lacked a sense of danger/risk of failure for the main characters. Of course there wasn't any doubt Wade would be the one to find the easter egg at the end, but at least in the book, one of the High Five was killed, whereas in the movie, the only danger was from a bunch of drones and a henchlady aggressively tailgating their truck.",87yv63

dx80gd4,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was kind of back and forth on if I wanted to catch this, because I've heard the book is kind of cringy and bad, but I'm glad I caught it. It was a really good specatacle type movie, the characters were fun, and they didn't go too overboard with the nostalgia stuff. There were definitely a couple bits where the dialogue was kind of awkward (like when they're talking about the guy's favorite Goldeneye mode or pointing out the Akira bike instead of letting it just be an easter egg), but not bad overall. That Wade fell for the girl so fast was kind of a ""you idiot!"" moment, but considering he's a teenage kid and all the other characters were also calling him out on it, I think it worked in context. I was actually kind of surprised they didn't use the references *more* considering how much they must have spent on licensing. Like Robocop and Sonic are there, but you really have to keep an eye open to even find them, as opposed to something like Wreck-it Ralph where Q-Bert's basically got a small character arc and other characters are at least referenced by name. The most ""referency"" part was probably the bit about [The Shining](#spoiler), and even then it felt like it worked really well in context and wasn't just an empty spoof. That part had a lot of potential to be like a dumb Family Guy cutaway, but it was great. The attention to detail in that sequence was also incredible, they did an excellent job recreating that 1 to 1. I appreciated the restraint though, too much of that sort of thing can be way too much really quickly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actors were pretty fun too. It's good that Tye Sherridan gets to headline a big movie like this, he's popped up in a couple things I've seen and has been really impressive. Mark Rylance is always fantastic, and while Ben Mendholson didn't have a ton of depth to his character, he was pitch perfect as a sleazy 80's business villain and I liked the digs at EA where he wants tiered subscriptions and 80% of the screen as ads. The girl was also likeable and the other supporting characters were very fun, I think I could have maybe used some more of them even, but I was happy with the ensemble.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The action was consistently a blast. I loved the visual style, not just of the VR game, but of the real world too. I think my favorite location was actually the IOI offices, it had just enough of an 80's sci-fi look to it, but felt like it could be a real place considering the scenario. The Stacks were also really great and felt more grounded than a lot of ""megaslum"" type places you see in Sci-Fi. I was kind of worried at first about the 3D since that opening in the Stacks looked kind of flat, but it was pretty good once they got into the Oasis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It actually struck me that compared to a lot of other high adventure movies, this one's *comparatively kind of plausible*. The most out there things were probably that the corporation could act so egregiously (but even then look at some of the stuff Scientology gets away with), and maybe The Stacks (plus the fact that poor people can afford VR, but by 2045 I'd imagine prices would be more affordable). The Oasis *kinda exists already*. You have stuff like Garry's Mod or VRChat, which might be trollier and less slick than in the movie, but you basically can play as whatever character from whatever franchise and do whatever you want in those, and there's a game going on right now called MonteCrypto where the first person to beat (by solving a series of convoluted riddles!) it gets $10,000 of Bitcoin. As far as the gaming stuff is concerned, someone could totally more or less make that if they felt like it. The gaming aspects really aren't speculative so much as it's *already here*, just super expensive and kinda janky.

So yeah, this was basically a really good example of a fun popcorn movie. It's not super deep, but it's well done, there's heart to it, and the spectacle was really entertaining. It could have certainly turned out a lot, lot worse, and I'm definitely glad I caught it on a really large screen.",87yv63

Two things bothered me especially. One was, why did the cop only show up at the very end when a coorp is taking human as slaves and seemingly has a death squad on his pay role. The second one was the explosion of his block. I mean okay maybe the aunt wasnt that nice but she didnt seem that bad. Lets just pretend she was hitler, there are still all his neighbors that died. Like the building blew up with dozens of people in it. Wade doesnt give a shit, gotta find a key or whatever. Also no police what so ever.

I was so surprised that a police actually existed in the first place after they were a no show all this time.

2. Splitting up Parzivals feats was a good idea. Z is a techy guy but his infiltration of IOI always seemed like it was a bit beyond his ability. When I first heard about the movie, I was dying to see Ultraman fight MechaGodzilla. Iron Giant and the RX78 is good compromise though.

3. I-R0K I didn't like so much. They took an inconsequential idiot classmate of Aech and Z and turned him into Boba Fett to Nolan Sorrento's Vader.

4. The High 5 all living in the same city was way too convenient. I also didn't like how quick they were to work together or how Aech was already buds with Daisho. 

5. I didn't like that they cut the challenges in half. The gates popping up a few steps away right after getting the key isn't something I like too much. He'll it's less than half. You needed the crystal key to even enter Anoraks Castle. I know. Time constraints. Still don't like it.

I enjoyed the 3rd act pretty well, but overall the movie suffered from weak character building in the first two acts.  Despite major cuts from the book, the world-building and exposition felt like it was crowding out some much-needed relationship building among the high five.  Aech and Parzival's friendship felt genuine, but the others did not.

Unfortunately the movie omitted Parzival's character arc entirely, which is a shame.  I would have liked to see his journey of self-improvement from the book, as he improves both his health and his real-world self-confidence.  Movie Art3mis's accidental stint at IOI headquarters did not have nearly the same impact as Book Parzival's ballsy infiltration and escape, particularly since the latter was the result of confident planning instead of a happy accident.

The main character was a complete imbecile (he's a supposed vet of the game world and doesn't understand the concept and importance of privacy and identity), the love angle was so rushed and tacked on it was embarrassing to watch it unfold (my plunger and toilet have better chemistry than either those two characters or actors), the tension was almost as artificial as the solutions that solved them (yeah, some kids beat a real world assassin. Ok, movie.) and all the pop culture references were so pointless, mechanical and obviously there just to be there that the movie is almost a masterwork of irony; the scene where the bad guy is being fed pop culture references in his ear just so he can appear 'hip' and 'relevant' and 'relatable' is a painfully accurate metaphor of the movie itself.

Jesus what a trainwreck.  Terrible performances, comedy that fell so flat it sounds like a fish smacking onto a washboard, a soundtrack that sounds like it came out of a focus test group, and action scenes that have no sense of weight, tension, drama or impact.

I can't imagine the kind of people who would find these references meaningful in any way; as if you're so starved validation that any acknowledgement of something you enjoy, even in the most asinine or passive manner, would be enough to make you cheer.

There was an entire scene after she died where he was depressed and dejected about what happened, similar how to Luke Skywalker got one brief scene of mourning Beru and Owen. Do you people not understand ""movie time?"" That's an enormous amount of time to devote to a ""beat"" in a story.

The only part that really bugged me was the development between Art3mis and Parzival and her being a resistant fighter, which is never in any way mentioned again just like this ""restistance"".

Nonetheless, it was a decent movie and better than I expected.",87yv63

Yes, you’re not going to get a life changing plot from the movie or anything. If you enjoy the source material and you’re able to tap into your inner kid, you will love this movie too. There’s so many cool references that you will pick up on and the entire plot is awesome to watch unfold.

Like, someone decided to play as a Battletoad avatar, but didn't customize it at all? 

PArzival and the other characters have custom avatars, but all these other players seem content to just choose one specific reference and stick to it, exactly in the original costume and the behavior of that character.

e0jycq5,"I heard great things about this movie, but i didnt get around to seeing it in theatres right away. Then i listened to the audio-book and was captivated. Probably going to be in my top 5 fiction stories of all time. 


The movie was bad. Really bad. Why they felt the need to change the story so drastically, cutting out some of the absolute best parts to throw in some uninspired new bit made no sense to me. The character motivations are shoddy at best, the villains are laughable, the references are lack luster and forced. 


I get that basing a movie off a book means you need to change some stuff, and cut some other stuff short of details, but this was honestly a disservice to the book, and to anyone who watched it. The product they COULDVE put out, and they SHOULDVE put out, was instead replaced by a mediocre story, with even more mediocre characters. The visuals were nice, but you cant polish a turd and expect me to be happy with it.
 

Some of my major beefs-

Avatar appearence- In the books the main avatars are pretty much just normal humans, with the ability to turn into whatever they want like shown in the movie. Instead we got weird alien looking people and characters straight from franchises. 

The love angle between Parzival and Art3mis was so fucking forced, i had absolutely 0 interest in it. He pretty much confesses his love to her like days after meeting her. And she for some reason has feelings for him too. 


The competition- Everyones working together, all smiles, no arguments, just playing the game for fun. This is horseshit, and is where a ton of the character development comes from in the books. The prize on the line is massive, its the reason everyone in the world becomes obsessed with the egg, because its a 1 way ticket out of your shitty life. The Gunters are secretive by nature, they love to discuss things, but each of them is working tirelessly trying to crack the riddles, and none of them give the info away willy nilly. That aspect not only gives us insight into the characters morals and identity and was a catalyst for disputes, but it also added a ticking clock, making every decision or wrong turn nerve wracking. But in the movie? nahhh, lets just have them all party up and have 3 out of 5 top players never mention the prize. 


The challenges-
 Driving backwards, 0 skill needed, 0 prep needed, just hella anti climactic. Also, how did noone else see him do that besides Art3mis? 

Escaping the containment pod- ""oh hey, just open up the hatch above you and flip the lever that turns everything off and lets you out"" What the flying fuck thats some lazy writing. 


The characters- 

Shoto and Daito were there to smile and say a cheesey one liner here and there. Nothing else explored for them, no background as to why they are part of the team, just ""oh hey, i know those 2"". 


H- Dumbed completely down, given the role of MCs buddy and doesnt go outside of that role at all. Doesnt eeven seem like a Gunter, just an oaf with some engineering skills. 


Art3mis- At least she was competent, but the romance angle absolutely killed her characters arc. She became the prize for MC right from the beginning. 


Villains- I forget his name, which isnt surprising because he was a completely forgettable character in the movie. I felt like he just needed to raise his fist shaking and yell out ""you damn kids"" to be complete. 

Wade- nervous nerd, no foresight. Just a bumbling kid who stumbles upon most his discoveries. Ill admit its hard to like this character after following the books version. 


Things i liked- The halloday actor did great IMO. I thought it was a very solid interpretation of what i had pictured of the introverted socially akward Halloday. Even when he was anarax you could see the acting coming through. 

The final challenge- I think the book was better, but i liked the throwback to the adventure easter egg and though it fit the movie really well. 


TLDR; Book was better. not just marginally, but in totality. The movie is a sad excuse for an adaption that might prove to be visually entertaining for awhile, but is otherwise a failed attempt to duplicate what made the book so good.

In the books the reason no one has found a key in five years is because it takes years of painstaking research and you still have to understand the mind of halliday to work out what he was getting at with his riddles. Whereas in the film it's literally, drive backwards. He went on a date once. And....????? who cares the Sixers found it.
It doesn't make sense that people hadn't solved it within 5 minutes if it's that simplistic. And the devotion and time required to be a Gunter was completely removed.",87yv63

dwm543e,"As someone who read and generally liked the book, I thought the film did a good job at stripping away some of the fat, and boy, was there a lot of fat in the book. Choosing the Shining instead of War Games was great and it had the theater howling. The film really nailed the (sometimes awkward) way the author would just bombard you with nostalgia. Turning IRok into a side-villain with a little more depth instead of the way it was used in the book was great as well, he got a lot of laughs.

 I was a little disappointed with how quickly they got into the egg hunt and how quickly he actually got the key.... I was expecting a little more worldbuilding and character building before we got to the race scene. I thought the falling in love and reveal of who Artemis happened waaaaaaaay too soon as well. The book did some worldbuilding a little better, but that's to be expected.

All in all it was one of those movies that was great to see in a packed theater. Lots of laughs, lots of nostalgia. Nothing earth shattering but a fun movie.",87yv63

dww0u23,"As I was watching this movie, I couldn't help but think of a number of [isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai) anime (i.e. KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Overlord, etc.), mainly because many of my praises and gripes with Ready Player One, I can also apply to these shows as well.

**Story: 5/10 Meh...**
We've seen stories like this before, but having the setting mainly be a VR world that's an analogue to the internet was cool. Also having the bad guy be a greedy businessman who represents scummy ISPs like Comcast was nice as well. 

**Characters: 4/10 Boring.**
Just like many MCs in animes & video games, the main character is nothing more than a self-insert character - a Gary Stu, if you will. The side characters are more interesting though, but not by much.

**Visuals: 8/10 Awesome!**
IMO the barrage of reference were pretty cool. However, I understand if some find it annoying. I personally don't mind eating 'memberberries every once in a while. Also, [The Shining scene literally made me gasp!](#spoiler) With that said, I wish the Oasis had a little more color to it. Maybe if they visited the world of The Witcher or Warcraft or something.

**Sound & Music: 5/10 Serviceable.**
Just like the visuals, the music and sound effects are a medley 80's soundtracks and classic movie scores (i.e. Back to the Future). Other than that, I can't really say anything else, just that it kept me entertained and focused on the movie.

Ogden acting as a year round curator makes no sense. Especially given the area is open to the public and would've been accessed at all hours. Art3mis's rebellion was never explained. Who are these people who choose to run around but never actually log into Oasis to hunt for the egg? It also took away from Art3mis's choice of only working alone. No Ultraman was a little disappointing, but I love Gundam so it's a compromise. Aech didn't get the explanation for her choice of avatar but I could see how a racial driven decision wouldn't fit in this rushed story. There was no way the movie was gonna sell me on the fact that the top 5 gunthers in the world lived in the same state. The Oasis also didn't seem like a universe with planets. They needed to show a few space ships traveling and fighting (no Bebop makes me sad).

The rest was great. I love back to the future so more delorean time is welcomed. A little more overwatch sightings that could've been shared with other media but Blizzard has an endless pit of money so I see how that happened. The Shining portion was excellent. The action always hit it's mark.

Artemis is supposed to also be a Halliday expert, but apparently she didn’t know about Halliday’s love for Kira (Morrow’s wife). IOI had a whole team of Halliday scholars so it was just weird that the ONLY person who knew about that was Wade. 

The other thing that slightly bothered me was that no one in the span of 5 YEARS would have tried to go backwards in that race? I don’t know about you but when I get stuck in a video game, I literally run around doing whatever it takes to try and move forward. I feel like someone would have just tried or accidentally gone backwards, it seemed waaayyyy too easy. 

It was pretty cheesy, but I don’t expect anything else from Spielberg. I thought the cast was good, albeit funny that Artemis is supposed to not be pretty. And again, the graphics are by far the best part of the whole movie and kept me engaged the whole time. ",87yv63

 There are enough references in the film for just about any age.  Also, Mark Rylance was better than he had any right to be for the role he had.

It shows how lonley dreamers feel in this world, how they desperatly want at least one person to truely understand them, but that usually impossible thing to do during one lifetime. Halliday was lucky man because he had a chance to create a game of his dreams, to share his vision and feelings with entire world, ignoring all the corporate people who tried to ruin it by monetizing and making other crappy changes. And eventually his legacy found a way to the people's heart. 

That's why i absolutly hated the ending. Well, good of you have a love, wealth, purpose, but this damn moron Wade never thikning about those who don't and will never have any of that, those who want to live a happier life inside Oasis. He also never thinked about disabled people who physicly cannot enjoy irl even if they wanted to.

I JUST now finished the movie and finished the novel two weeks ago.  
The movie leaves a lot to be desired. It captured the basic story well including specific quotes and threw in a lot of modern-day easter eggs that was incredibly enjoyable to see.  
However, the character development of Wade or anyone else was entirely gone. I realize its hard to fit everything into a movie but it feels like every character was in the perfect place at the perfect time. All the HighFive just HAPPENED to be right next to each other. You dont really care who they are or what theyre doing as they are only there to push Wade forward (Whereas the books fleshed them out and had their own intentions.) There was no weight to anything including death. IOI did some real shitty stuff in the books whereas the movie glossed over it and really just felt like a big kid with a stick threatening to hit someone. It will hurt but its not a major threat.

I was just wow-ing all the time and totally amazed by the amount of references and characters this movie had. From Ryu to Chucky, Gundam to Godzilla it was just amazing. Like a childhood dream come to life.

To be honest, I see it did just decently on rotten tomatoes, but personally I liked everything about it. The characters, the plot, the action, the message and most of all it was just FUN! Some good fun and adventuring like I haven't experienced in a while. I'm sure if you took your whole family to see this movie most everyone would enjoy it, from the grandpa to the little kid they would have a really good time with it. I think we need more movies like that.

e4cas5r,"This was a fun movie. It had great action scenes, strong CGI and spectacles, and good video game and movie references like the Shining, etc. Also, I liked how Wade wanted to explore Halliday's fears and desires about building the OASIS and whether he has any regrets or not. Haliday's motivations, also did a good job of connecting to the keys, with each key pertaining to something in his life that he regrets because of this techno/corporate growth in his life. He wanted his successor to learn from his past mistakes.  

Those are some positives, along with the dance room sequence, as well as some parts of the final battle.  However, I felt the two biggest problems were lack of character development, and some truly cheesy dialogue. Not to mention that Wade's relationship with Artemis felt rushed and underdeveloped. He fell in love with her in two days?  So stupid. Their ""relationship"" was not feel earned at all. I put ""relationship"" in quotes, because I didn't call it one, when all you're doing is sitting around making out with someone (shown in the ending).

Wade and Samantha's real life scenes were cringy and it definitely felt like they have skipped a lot of necessary stages required for a relationship to develop.

I read a review a while back that this was a movie ""made for people who like to clap and 'woo' at things"" - unfortunately I got sat next to the physical embodiment of that quote in the theater who was WOOOOOing like Rick Flair through 90% of the film - making some of the things that were borderline cringy, go well over that line for me.

I'm also a bit confused by how they had Rylance portray Halliday? Is this Spielberg / Penn's view of a shut in nerd? Or were they generally trying to give a platform to character who is on the autism spectrum (which actually would have been kind of great)? I wasn't convinced either way - which left that character just a bit odd in the grand scheme of the film.

-Rather shocked that no one got the clue for the first key after *five years* of trying the challenge. The solution would have been obvious to any gamer who has played a platformer made since *Braid*.

dwm4u4f,"The changed alot from the book. It's basically two different stories that share a plot line and a title. The movie was decent enough, I enjoyed watching it. A few thoughts:

- wished they delved more into eighties pop culture
- I understand why they didn't do Joust as the first challenge, mainly because it would be boring to watch for the casual viewer. But I wish they kept the DnD dungeon crawl with the Lich King and expanded on it. It would hold true to the book and be entertaining. That being said, I still thought the race was well done.
- didn't enjoy how much time they spent cross cutting between the real world and the Oasis. I felt it took away from the fact that the Oasis is essentially life (economics, politics, etc.) in this universe. Instead it felt more like they made it a glorified MMO. 
- the movie felt very rushed. I'm not sure how they could have fixed it, but the way it ran was jarringly fast. 
- piggy backing off that, Parzival's and Art3mis' relationship felt very artificial
- the visuals were great
- I really enjoyed the final battle
- the acting was solid all around
- IOI was a joke in the movie compared to the book. Seemed cartoonish. There's an event that happens in the book that I wish they kept in. It would really sell that they're a legitimate threat.

All in all solid 6.5/10 movie. Go watch it, enjoy it, and then go read the book if you haven't already.",87yv63

None of these though detract too badly...

But the main glaring issue by and far above all others? The movie seems to believe that the definition of subtlety is ""Smash their face in with a club""... there are so many moments where it felt like if it just cut to a guy screaming out an explanation to what just happened it would have been **more** subtle then the scene itself. A lot of this is to do with it's extreme use of cliche's ans stereotyped characters, but even then it seems to go out of it's way to really lay on the lack of subtlety.",87yv63

So, as someone out of the loop and with no prior reference, I can only say that Ready Player One was a delight. It’s like Spielberg was making every nerd’s wet dream come true right before our eyes. I’m not much of a gamer, so besides those most universally known characters I’m sure I didn’t catch a lot of the Easter eggs, but I was LIVING for every movie reference (which are more on my turf). 

I can only imagine how much fun it must have been for Spielberg to create something like that (even with homages to his own work), and yet I was fully aware of how difficult it must have been to pull of a movie like this, which certainly stands among the most impressive technical achievements of his career.

e3pilyn,"I love this movie and it touched me deeply. Watched it on BluRay all weekend. A lot of people talk about the movies actions scenes or characters that make them like/dislike the movie but that's just the surface gloss for the normal movie goer. The real movie was in the subtle and VERY WELL IMPLEMENTED nostalgic references that most people don't notice or care about and the underlying story of playing games before they became ""industrial"".

I'm in my 40s, and grew up as a kid in the 80s so I experience this movie very differently than a younger person would. In fact I think the movie almost doesn't work well because only someone in their 40s can really enjoy it but the movie seems to have been aimed at modern day teenagers who would never understand what they are looking at. I also played Atari 2600 Adventure when I maybe 8-10 yrs old and I remember hearing rumor about the magic dot and actually finding it and the Easter egg myself. I remember the controversy at the time about game developers not being allowed tohave their credits in games. To see that game from 1980 and that Easter egg play out on a big screen in 2018 (nearly 40 years later) almost makes me cry.

I think they did a great job with what they had. It's a movie that has to appeal to a wide audience, not just  hardcore gamers/internet users. If you take away the glitz and characters, the underlying story about halliday and gaming in general is a great story by itself.",87yv63

dwhhqen,"I can say that the movie was okay. It met my expectations, which were not very high to begin with. I can understand why they changed the challenges in the movie, copyright issues and that most of the challenges in the book were video game playing secessions that were drawn out and would not translate well to film. I can understand why they removed the need to hunt down the gates as well as the keys, it would extend an already 2 and a half hour long movie. What I can’t understand is why they made Wade, Aech, Art3mis, Toshiro, and Akihide into essentially Mary Sue characters. By cutting out Wade’s depression from the movie they removed his character development from the story. Wade just comes off as a guy with few character flaws other than him being somewhat awkward to talk to.same goes for the rest of the cast. Not to say that the book did characterization any better, the movie just highlights how bad it was to begin with and somehow manages to make it worse.

All in all, the writing was pretty bad, the script was pretty generic, using minimal plot points from the book, but holy hell does Steven Spielberg make the world of Oiasis look damn impressive.

One final nitpick that I have is how the hell did nobody figure out to drive backwards for the first challenge after many years of attempting it.

On one hand, there are moments that are top Spielberg. I love his vision of the Oasis, and how the camera is always swinging around the place. It reminded me a lot of Tintin (a movie I fucking adore), and shows that Spielberg really can direct the hell out of CGI picture. The race sequence is stunning and visceral. It’s also easily the best part of the movie in my opinion. 

On the flip side, the film feels half-baked. I like the idea of the story, and the film definitely improves upon some the book’s major flaws. Yet, the storytelling in this movie is more Hook than some of Spielberg’s greats, like Jurassic Park or Raiders of the Lost Ark. 

I am way more interested in the movie as a Spielberg processing his own legacy and the blockbuster experience he helped create. It’s also a really interesting rumination on how we trap ourselves in popular culture, and kind of build our own little nostalgic-fuel prisons. 

What did you all think about the second trial (I won’t specific for spoilers)? At first it pissed me the hell off. But then, as it went on, I kind of dug it. Idk. I’m still wrestling with that one.

The best thing about this movie is that it has that same cynicism-free Spielberg magic that all the other good Spielberg movies had. *Ready Player One* could have been a cynical cash grab fueled by pop culture references from the Warner Bros catalog, but instead it felt like the cinematic equivalent of playing a great video-game with a close friend. Even when the movie was waving its references in front of you, it never felt like they were trying too hard to make you like this movie. Heck, I think this movie works even without its pop culture references. 

Sure, my judgment might be a little bit clouded by my love for *The Shining* and *Gundam*. And you can definitely make a case that I thought the movie was good because my favorite things are in it. But I don't think that's the case. I watched this in a packed theater in China, and while the audience didn't seem to get most of the Western pop culture references (apart from the Spartan warriors from HALO and Tracer from Overwatch), a common sentiment I heard when I was leaving the theater was that this movie was ""good"". 

I know I'll probably have a few bones to pick with it if I think about it more, but I don't think I'll dislike this movie. I know I'll definitely catch this at least one more time in IMAX (if I can), and at the very least, I'll probably see it again on home video. ",87yv63

e1n7pbq,"This movie is the antidote to the ""Mary Sue"" trend plaguing modern entertainment. That is where the female character is made out to be a super-smart, super-tough badass that is constantly outdoing the men and making them look like buffoons (Ant-Man and Mary Sue Wasp coming soon to your multiplex). This movie made a wonderfully subtle critique of that trend. 

They started Artemis out as EXACTLY that type of character, talking back to the male lead, acting like she knows more than him about everything and like she needs him like a fish needs a bicycle. Then they methodically DECONSTRUCTED that whole archetype. With each passing scene we learn more about Artemis and find out that was really just a fake persona for her. We see how vulnerable she really is, including problems with self-confidence and tragedies that weigh her emotions down.

What all this does is do what it's supposed to do, make her much more likable and relatable then all these other modern Little Miss Perfects. She is absolutely a worthy member of the hero team. She shows courage and intelligence at many points. But she's an equal member of the team. She doesn't know everything and she needs help sometimes. The other team members are allowed to have just as many heroic moments as she does instead of her stealing the spotlight every time.

This is what movies like The Force Awakens and Sony's Ghostbusters reboot got so wrong. They tried to shove gender politics into our face and did so at the expense of character development. They tried to imply that all the men who were fans of these franchises were some kind of sexist, chauvinist pigs. But in reality, the fans of movies like these ALWAYS enjoyed seeing women play an equal role. They just have no desire to see women force out the male characters and make them look weak and stupid. Ready Player One got the gender balance exactly right just like all the classic Lucas and Spielberg movies of the 1970s and 1980s did. Ready Player One didn't make its female character into a caricature just so the filmmakers could virtue signal about how ""woke"" they are to radical feminists. Instead they ingeniously used that modern stereotype as a springboard to make us think Artemis was one type of character before playing with our expectations by making her into someone so much more well-rounded and well-developed.",87yv63

It being spring break in my area, the theatre was packed with teens and younger adults. I went with my wife and kid and we all enjoyed it immensely. Theatre even clapped at the end.

The balance they struck between the real world and the oasis really worked well. That balance, and to an extent the general plot, is how the Assassin's Creed movie *should* have gone imo

He bascally just caught the main gist   of the plot and rewrote the hole story to suit his creation, is how I feel, and even that was altered. While I think the movie was visually stunning, it shows me how capable they were to interpret the books story and didn't. I understand you have to cut it back cause they don't have the time.

You just want something that's easy to follow and fun to watch, and Ready Player One delivered in classic Spielberg style.",87yv63
dwjxvv9,"No cut scene at the end. For a movie about Easter eggs, that felt wrong. ",87yv63
dwlqru1,"I liked this film a lot. To me it follows the book well enough. I thought changing the challenges was done in a good way, yes less cerebral but allowed for more good action sequences. I would have liked Oggy to have been in more of the story. It honestly felt like he was cut out a bit. I really liked Ech in this they did a good job with her and I liked that actress for that part. 

I'll also say this for all of the book diehard fans that are complaining about this film for being different. The actual author wrote the script for this. It is evident to me with the changes he was trying to craft this more as a film, and also to give people a different experience than the book. IMO it works well because I think you could still read the book and be interested in it. I dunno I guess I different from a lot of people in not minding changes like this that allow for *both* mediums to be appreciated. Would I really want the challenges to just be Parsival playing an Atari game? Not really. I think they did Haliday right as well. 

One scene I really genuinely loved and had the Spielberg effect to it was when he actually gets the Egg. There was something kind of religious in the way it was presented. His hands shining and him kneeling down like it. It reminded me of something from Indiana Jones really. It was a cool ending IMO. 

Overall this movie is a celebration of nerd culture like the book. It is a celebration of these things that bring us together and we find fun and inspiration in. Spielberg really got that with this film and that was really what was at the heart of the novel IMO. 

To me this movie was a solid 8/10. Not because there was anything wrong with it, but just because the story itself is never reaching for that much. It's a fun movie and it appeals to nerds so it sucks that they are trying to tear it apart like they like to do. But it's just meant to be fun, which it is. ",87yv63

dz7zhbn,"This is the most fun Spielberg movie since the 1980s and the most entertaining movie I've seen since Avatar. It's amazing in how it shows you don't need darkness, grimness and a depressing tone to make a modern action/adventure movie that is thoroughly involving and gripping.

This had one of the greatest plots of any recent adventure movie, with lots of nice surprises that didn't call undue attention to themselves as the ""big twist."" The sense of forward momentum in the story is so strong and powerful. Most movies these days don't keep you on the edge of your seat like this. There is never a moment where you aren't rooting for the heroes to win and fascinated to find out what is going to happen next.

The cinematography was some of the most brilliant I have ever seen. The shots in that opening chase scene made me feel like I was flying down an insane amusement park ride. The way the zombie dance scene was shot was just ridiculously creative and perfect. The whole sequence at the dance club was one of the BEST directed scenes I have EVER seen in ANY movie. So much complicated stuff happens in that sequence with such complete smoothness and clarity to the storytelling. So many different kinds of tones need to be struck in rapid succession during the club scenes and the movie does not miss a beat in making every moment feel exactly right. This movie was clearly directed by a storytelling master at the top of his game. It should be studied by every director out there.

This is a true ""I loved the part where"" movie like we haven't seen since the glory days of the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones. I loved the part where King Kong smashes the motorcycle! I loved the part where the characters dance to Saturday Night Fever! I loved the part where I-Rock explodes into a massive pile of treasure! I loved the part where Sorrento is pulling off his employees' helmets looking for Samantha! I loved the part where Mecha Godzilla gets blown up by a Madball! I loved the part where Wade almost destroys the entire Oasis on his first day! Incredible moments of artful cinematic beauty and perfectly staged and timed story beats just jump out at you throughout the movie. This is not just another movie trying to show you what is happening, this is a movie that makes you feel and experience everything that is happening. Few movies in history have ever been shot, framed and edited this brilliantly and expertly to draw you so deeply into the story that it becomes an out-of-body experience. The original Star Wars is one of the few other ones.

I've seen this movie 3 times in the theater and will watch it at least 100 times at home like I haven't watched a movie since the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies and Superman 1 and 2. This is a movie for people who love the movies and everything else they grew up with in the 1980s that they can love just as much. It is a movie that honors and celebrates a period of time in cultural history that is so very special to so many people. We get so many movies telling us how bad humanity is or was at some point in the past (like the dreadful, depressing, dark, dreary 2017 Skull Island). This is a movie that instead reminds us how happy we can be and how good it can feel to be alive. It tells us that no matter what our personal flaws and imperfections are, we can find joy in life and accomplish amazing things. It's a miraculous, soaring, pure entertainment like nobody has made for decades. It is one of the most fun, joyful, pleasurable, ingenious, intelligent, inspired, beautiful, amazing, life-affirming movies ever made.",87yv63

dwhhx37,"A few thoughts. To start off, I really enjoyed this movie. If they could make an 1 1/2 film about random characters fighting each other, I'd watch that all day (as long as it's always kicked off by a shot of Battlefrogs.

There was some really interesting cameos. Not only did they have Overwatch, but I caught a Battleborn cameo as well. They had a ton of properties and that was super cool.

Where were the police in this entire movie? They show up randomly at the end and that's it? I'd assume there would be more to it.  Also, how did they get the first key? He figured out going backwards but no one else figured it out. I can only assume they copied one of the Asian guys who finished at the end which is cool.  

Also, Gundam vs Mecha Godzilla is a matchup I never knew I wanted until now",87yv63

Overall I liked it. A lot of fun references, overall good acting, and script. I really enjoyed the two main characters and I felt their chemistry was believable. The Shining scenes were probably my favourite part. 

My only two negatives from the movie are:

1. I did find some of the transitions a bit jumpy, but it's understandable as the film is half in the real world and half in the virtual world. It felt that it was going a bit fast at times (especially in the second and third act), so be prepared to keep up (maybe I was tired though). 

2. I saw the movie with a friend who is way less of a nerd than me. He missed a lot of the references, to say the least (e.g.,   he didn't know gundam, masterchief, easter egg, etc). I think people who are nerds will enjoy this movie a lot more than average joes.

I get why a lot was changed, but I felt like this movie lacked a lot of exposition that was necessary? I enjoyed it from a ""I'm so happy I got to see this specific part brought to life"" aspect, but SO much was missing that would've been super easy to reproduce, so I did leave a bit disappointed overall.

dwv8z7h,"I just wanted to share some thought on the movie.

Spielberg handles action like no other. That car race near the beginning was absolutely perfect. Also, the final battle is so great.

The main characters were a bit flat but the actors really pulled it out great. Ben Mendelsohn was great as the villain (as he usually is) and Olivia Cooke is a really interesting discovery for me, as I hadn't watched any movie of her. I didn't really liked that much Tye Sheridan in the real world scenes as he seemed a bit emotionless at parts, but otherwise the cast was great. Special shoutout to Mark Rylance, he always nails his part.

The visuals were really great and I loved scenes like the race or specially The Shining sequence, how they are created and the care to detail they put. 

The references were off-putting for some, but I loved every appearance of characters I knew (Batman, Mechagodzilla, The Iron Giant, and the FUCKING CHUCKY!)

And the soundtrack was fantastic. Not just the song selection but also the score by Alan Silvestri. Pure orchestral fun.

Really great and entertaining movie, although there were some big flaws in relation to the story, but I don't know if maybe that's problem of the book. Anyway, super enjoyable film. Solid 8/10",87yv63

I heard on r/horror that there was a really great horror reference that played a main part in the story line.  That certainly did not disappoint.  The Chucky appearance was great as well.

This is to be expected, every time a movie comes out following a book, those who read the book are disappointed because things are left out and honestly I don’t know of any movie that can live up to what one sees in their own mind when reading a good book. 

That being said, I thought this movie was fantastic. 

The soundtrack was perfect. 

The throwbacks to 100’s of games was nostalgic. 

The graphics were just phenomenal. 

I also think this was a pretty accurate depiction of what our world could end up being in the future, as even walking out of the movie I craved a few hours in the OASIS myself...


Well done Spielberg, you have created another masterpiece. ",87yv63
dwiubck,"I saw in the OASIS a metaphor for cinema, and in Wade’s passion for it, a young Spielberg diving into movies and giving up on the real world. Both of them, because of their true passion for those unreal worlds, were capable to understand them and to torn their rules to become, in the end, « the kings of entertainment ». 

It’s kind of the same thing for Halliday. When he leaves the room by saying « Thank’s for playing my game », I saw an elder Spielberg, in the heart of today’s pop-culture saying « Thanks for watching my movies and being a part of the worlds I created ».

This movie is the signature of Spielberg’s legacy in contemporary culture and in the history of cinema, in which he creates and exists. Spielberg is PLAYER ONE.

",87yv63
dwkh1rd,"Something that really struck me was a scene where we see Director Krennic as an intern. We see a brief moment where Krennic is talking to Halliday, attempting (to no avail) to find some common ground with him. 

Krennic says something like ""we could have gold, silver, bronze members, based on what they pay"" Halliday nods the idea off; he just wants people to play his game. 

Later on, Krennic is in a board meeting, scheming with the other suits over their plans should they find the egg. Their idea: blatantly fill the Oasis hub with ads, in gameplay no less. 

I immediately felt this was subtextual to what we struggle with today. Net neutrality, pay to play, and loot boxes all come to mind--these are the opponents we internet users and gamers have to struggle with, what we may someday have to adhere to completely, and while the stakes are certainly different, this part of the film felt ominous and...familiar. 

I haven't read the book yet, but if Spielberg wrote this part in, I'm very impressed at his ability to recognize the times we are living in and make it an effective antagonist in the film, especially for his age. ",87yv63

The special effects were top notch.  The first race scene was edge of your seat, incredible action.  The Shining scene was also very impressively done.

The pop culture references were always fun and very rarely overbearing or forced. 

Yes the romance felt a bit ""rushed"" but these are socially awkward kids that live in a video game and don't have a lot of social aptitude.  I thought the cringey lines between them were actually kind of sweet and appropriate for the kind of people that they are.

Also Halliway was great comic relief but was also surprisingly touching at the end when he showed himself as a kid playing video games.  It made me think back to simpler times and is a great reminder of why he built the Oasis and why all of us were sitting in the theater watching a movie about video games.  We love them and the sense of wonder and adventure they can give you.

All in all just a very enjoyable movie.",87yv63

dx2s7i7,"This film just felt lifeless to me. There was nothing that really drew me to the main characters. Aech and Parzival had an interesting dynamic, but Aech gets sidelined by ""love interest"" pretty quickly and Sho and Daito might as well not exist. Except for the pop culture references dealing directly with Halliday and his game, they seemed pointless and arbitrary. Why not use references to say something more about the characters than just ""they like 80's-90's stuff""?

The way they set up the car race frustrated me. [So they had been trying for 5 years to win the race and no one had thought to try going in reverse? I feel like someone would have tried within the first day just because that's how people in the real world play games. It took Halliday basically spelling it out in a really awkward and out of place statement, even by Halliday's standards, to get it.](#spoiler)

The ending was also disappointing. [They obviously live in a world with a lot of problems, but Wade doesn't seem to use any of his wealth and influence to help the world (which I thought was going to be part of his ""heroic arc"") beyond closing the loyalty centers and shutting off the game Tuesdays and Thursdays. I thought there would be some grand gesture of ""giving Oasis to the people"" or working to make reality better so that people didn't feel like they needed to escape to Oasis to have a good life.](#spoiler)

Given all the positive reviews, I thought that there might be something more to the movie, like exploring the issues that arise in a society where so many people spend their time in virtual reality and transitioning between the two, or that the film would be more comedic and have a bit more fun with the references beyond, ""did you see the batmobile!""",87yv63

Also was Daito originally going to be Scorpion from Mortal Kombat?

Watching Duke Nukem get headshotted. The movie was certainly fun. Saw it at a Dolby Atmos theater with rumble chairs and that was cool.

Something that annoyed me was that the final key (as well as the others to a lesser extent) was far too easy. For one of the biggest corporations in the world, with its own pop culture department, I'm amazed that the correct solution wasn't within the first five attempts.

They rewrote most of the book, the challenges, the timeframes and they totally omitted a lot of stuff.

dwkl1lv,"Agreed with some if the choices made and disagreed with others. Seeing Daito jump out of Serenity and into a mobile suit was my favorite moment. 

There were 2 things I felt we're lacking. The first being scale. The race scene does a great job of show casing the wide variety and chaos the Oasis holds, but beyond it every setting felt contained as opposed to being part of one huge world. The book makes it a point that traveling between sectors takes hours without a warp gate. It also largely ignores how Central the Oasis is in the world economy. 

The thing I felt missing was a certain person death that was omitted from the movie. I won't say who, but I felt their death was probably the most shocking part of the book that truly showed how ruthless and how far IOI was willing to go to achieve their goal. The other thing the death does is it brought the High Five together. Most of the book, each character, with the exception of Daito and Shoto acted alone. The movie simplifies this and we get a lot of scenes where characters randomly run into each other. 

Overall, I was skeptical when I heard they were adapting the book given the different licenses and references, but I left quite pleased in that aspect. I'm also glad they didn't split it into 2 or 3 movies as I originally feared. Would it have been better as a mini series? Probably, but I'd doubt we'd get as many references as the movie pulled off. I can see how book readers might be upset over creative decisions, but in the end, we got a movie centered around videogaming and pop culture references galore on a grand scale. I'll take it.",87yv63
dwl4nsj,"I thought it was good but not great. I think the Creator vs Corporate theme of the movie resonated somewhat with me. Especially in this time where content creators (filmmakers, musicians, artists, game devs, web devs, etc) either sell out to get wide approval and ad revenue or they genuinely produce good content because they love their creation(s)/hobbies but probably aren't making as much money as they ""should"". Halladay was just a passionate game developer who would only trust his creation with someone who understood him on a more human level. While his disappointing intern Sorrento seeks to succeed him and turn the game into a ad-infested nightmare and would definitely lock certain things behind paywalls (as if certain items in the game weren't already hard to obtain). My biggest problem was pacing. Especially after Wade refuses Sorrento's offer. It just kinda seems to go by fast after that scene. The best example is when his aunt dies (and probably some of his neighbors too) and he gets over it pretty fast once he meets Artemis in person. Zero time for him to reflect what happened and how their adventure has gotten innocent people killed.

I still, overall, liked the movie and I kinda feel obligated to defend one aspect of the movie that I know can be pretty divisive.

In a world where everyone seems to work just so they can pay for necessities and VR equipment, it makes sense why the Oasis seems pandery to us viewers. If everyone just stayed home after work and played one video game for their whole life as amusement, it'd make sense for pop culture to pretty much be in a standstill and thus cause Oasis users to milk out characters and locations from times when people were actually creative.

Also, I admittedly fell for the Shining scene. I was not prepared for it. lol",87yv63
dwl5cpz,"With the education achievement gap in this country and the fact that we are now looking to privatize education with tax burdens given to people who send their children to private school, I was extremely surprised that this movie didn’t touch upon the free education aspect of the Oasis.

I’m sure the top gripe would be the puzzle changes. I didn’t mind some of the puzzle changes because the ones from the book would be boring to watch. And from the trailer I know Wade meets Artemis early on, which is understandable.

I didn’t really have any gripes about it and fairly enjoyed myself. The few gripes I did have would be that the movie has some sort of feel to it that seemed like in between a kids movie and an adult movie. And it got really cheesy towards the very end in the van after Wade had won.

The Good:

- THESE EFFECTS! Truly incredible scenes in the OASIS itself, the first 30 minutes or so felt like classic spielberg.

- Performances from most of the cast were good especially Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn.

- That race sequence will probably be my favourite sequence for the rest of the year

- The references didn't get too annoying

- Humour was on point and never felt out of place

- Cinematography was also very well done

- Silvestri's score was his best since Polar Express

The Bad:

- Odd pacing and convenience when it came to the story itself. the way the High Five came together was so rushed and poorly conceived.

- Z didn't seemed shocked by Aech's appearance unlike Artemis although that is a large part of the book.

- The puzzle-solving aspect of the easter egg hunt didn't feel prevalent enough

- The romance was severely underdeveloped and felt like it just had to be there since it was in the book but in the book it was developed over several months which would've been hard to translate to film.

- It was odd how everyone happened to show up at the colombus stacks at the end.

The 74% (as of now) score does it no justice, the movie was much better and should at least harbour a score in the high 80’s. It successfully engaged me and my friends (who aren’t too into video games), keeping us active, laughing, shocked, surprised at even points... also cringe at certain points but what can you do. 

Great movie, would recommend. ",87yv63
dwimxe7,"Before I get my thoughts out on the movie, I just have to say this:


I think this is going to attract an audience that is not mature enough to watch a movie in a theater. All over, throughout the entire movie, nobody could shut up about ""It's Freddy Krueger!"", ""It's the Iron Giant!"", ""He's wearing an Asteroids shirt!"" We know. We see. Yes, it's obvious.



Anyway, I'm torn. There was a lot I liked, and a lot that I didn't like, that was unfortunately peppered in throughout basically the whole movie.


* A lot of cringey dialogue all throughout, mostly when it delved into ""gamer"" lingo. It also dipped into South Park ""Make Love Not Warcraft"" territory a few times.

* Almost all of the nostalgia was ""Hey, you see this thing? you remember this thing!"", which I didn't get anything out of. However, out-of-universe, I'll be interested to watch the ticker go up as people spot more and more things in the background.

* I liked the look of The Oasis a lot, I thought it was generally well-paced, and I was mostly invested in the story throughout.

* The way they treated online relationships, platonic and romantic, was perfect and came from a very knowing place that I really appreciated. Hardly any poking fun at it (other than ""she could be a dude""), but just very genuine ""he's my best friend, even though we've never met in real life.""

* The use of the cataclysm was unexpected and really got some tension in there.

* I really enjoyed the sequence starting from Wade finding the easter egg in Adventure to his farewell with Halliday. Very quiet, very personal, and a great contrast to the war that immediately preceded it.

* Far and away the best part was The Shining. In direct opposition to ""hey, remember this thing?"", that entire sequence banks on you being very familiar with that movie, then actively plays with your expectations, and morphs it into its own thing. Much more in the basket of ""embrace the things that you love, because they are a part of you, and use your influences to create something new"" than ""show me the things I loved as a kid because I loved them."" I wish there was at least one more major scene in the movie that did this.


Overall it was clunky, but enjoyable.",87yv63
dwmteex,"I had fun watching it, but it was not a good movie. Feverishly paced, lack of character and world building, too many convenient pop ins. It striped away a lot of the feel of the book IMO, the way the quarter was earned was WAY cooler in the book. Oasis didnt seem all that big in the movie despite being like an endless collection of worlds. Got a dance club world, Doom world( which is the only end game zone apparently) and Mine-craft world.  
Its like the movie banks on the viewer being too distracted by the myriad of shout outs, pop culture references and easter eggs to notice the story and characters are weak.  
I wouldn't mind the world being the most interesting character in the movie, so long as they actually flesh that out.  
6/10",87yv63
dwgmb86,"Just saw it. It definitely wasn't bad, but I didn't love it either.

It got a nice ovation from the crowd, which is probably a good sign.

My thoughts:

- I think this fits with the ""Spielberg doesn't know when to end a movie anymore"" criticisms that I've heard before. I felt like this could've been 20-25 minutes shorter. The Shining sequence was pretty fun and the first racing scene was great pure spectacle, but I thought the ending dragged a bit.

- IMO, jumping between the virtual world/real world makes it a little bit harder to connect with the drama, as the action feels surreal and thus not as important when it's all obvious CGI/video game stuff.

- The movie kind of has that National Treasure type of thing where characters just figure out what they need to figure out at convenient times. You just go with it.

- Enjoyed the pop culture references, which I probably wouldn't have come to see this without. Clever marketing gimmick. ",87yv63
dwmku4g,"I didn't enjoy the movie, probably because I've read the book, but usually that isn't something that would annoy me. The romance between the two main characters didn't fit, Artemis was basically throwing herself at him, they were helping each other solve puzzles from the start which just wasn't fitting with the solo gunter style the book described and Wade kept alluding to. Also, why close the Oasis 2 days a week? It only makes sense after he becomes rich, for him. People go to school in the Oasis, no mention of any of those things.

A few things didn't make sense either, like how was Aech right outside in that alleyway already? They just all happened to live or be in Columbus, Ohio, when the Oasis is worldwide (in the books Shoto/Daito are from Japan). Artemis was also running around their base without being spotted, not even by security when leaving the building?",87yv63

The biggest being it was very caricature-y with the whole evilcorp/loyalty center thing, the basic as hell love story and the characters all around. It also had a bit too much explanation and such; and overall had a very kids movie feel to it. In theory that's fine but then a ton of the references were stuff that you basically need to be 30 to care about. Pretty sure Atari, gundam, Shining, even iron giant are old at this point. It was a weird balance of that mostly quite old stuff but in a kids-friendly package.

That said Spielberg does know how to direct a movie and it was plenty enjoyable enough as well as very pretty. These kinds of piles of references usually end up bad for a very good reason but the dude knows how to make a film even with such messy material. ",87yv63

All that said, I did think it was kind of boring at times and really started to drag in the third act.

dwprni3,"My biggest gripes were with the first half hour or so in the film.  I wish they would have spent more time fleshing out James Halliday and why so many people were obsesssed with him.  I wanted the very start of the movie to be the announcement video of the Easter egg contest as it was seen in the book (was supposed to be a five minute video which explained the contest full of cryptic clues) then cut to Wade’s broken life, then him logging into the OASIS.  I felt the first few scenes did a poor job setting up the backstory and could have been done a lot more tastefully.

I also would have liked to see more background on Wade and them explain the OASIS more.  I wanted us to see Wade as poor and without credits in school and how rough he had it, as it was seen in the book.  I wanted them to show the OASIS as more than just a video game and how the economy from virtual goods tied into the real world.  I also wanted a scene going over just how much media Wade consumed and how much he devoted to finding the keys.  The movie tried to touch on how much of a Halliday nerd he was, but it just didn’t click.

The action scenes and acting and scenery were amazing though.  The movie itself was well made.  But I don’t feel like it had the heart and soul of the source material.  Overall the movie was good, but disappointing.",87yv63

dwgsm3v,"Even though there are many deviations between the book and the movie, I must say that I enjoyed them both very much.  This adaptation was able to preserve the spirit of the book but had to compromise on many of the plot points and finer details of the story... and for the first time in a LONG time, I'm okay with that.  At its core this is a straight up treasure hunt adventure movie with over-the-top fantastic visuals that was much better than I thought it would be.  I really liked Mark Rylance's portrayal of the socially awkward Halliday which glued the entire movie together, without him having such an important role in the film I honestly think the whole thing would've fallen apart.

The films biggest flaw I would say is [the romance between Parzival and Artemis.  It felt very rushed and slightly more cringey than the book. In fact one might argue that the sense of time in the movie seems to take place over a couple of days, but in the books it took several months.](#spoiler)  However, when I think of all the challenges that a film like RPO poses to filmmakers; copyright infringements galore, run time, budget, re-hashing of the plot, etc.  I would say that Spielberg, Cline, and everyone involved did one hell of a job on a massive undertaking such as this.  Big shout out to all those companies who allowed their pop-culture icons and characters to be used for this film.  I'm sure that I'll go back and watch it again 1.

He just has that potato chip eating, dorito dusted fingers, couch potato loser voice. I also really liked how Halliday's life slowly revealed itself through the movie, that was a well done sub plot.

And the easter eggs holy crap! My eyes darted everywhere in every scene just to take it all in. My favorite has to be the Ninja Turtles, Spawn with the DC Characters (who have crossovers in the comics too!), the Halo Spartans and the Zemekis Cube (the BTTF jingle and the fact that it changed back time was genius!). There were so many gaming culture references in there too. Twitch, TJ Miller's ""loser"" type, the stereotype that gamers have never talked to a girl before (I mean Wade falls in love with Sam on the spot!)

I’ll start with the good. Awesome, and I mean AWESOME, action. Say what you will about modern Spielberg, but the man can direct and frame action scenes like no other. The first car race and the final battle scene are sensory orgasms.  The soundtrack, of course, is legendary. The acting is solid, although not supported by any kind of good dialogue writing. I really loved some of the characters, namely H, I-Rok (TJ Miller), and Halliday. 


But it’s impossible to watch Ready Player One without noticing it’s significant shortcomings. 


The plot is all over the place and criminally underdeveloped at parts. The romance is lame and forced, they didn’t flesh out the “rebellion” at all, and the villain is just kinda there. A full half star deduction for the awful, phoned-in, too-perfect ending. It just felt super not genuine or earned and so goddamn cheesy. Really took the impact out of what’s supposed to be a climactic moment. The tone is inconsistent and some of the character writing is subpar.

I didn't dislike the movie, but i'd really like to see it again as a story of a guy trying to win a contest in a VR world who finds love in the real world as a result, without the references. It'd be corny, sure, but Speilberg would do it far better justice than I felt he did with this one. ",87yv63
dwm6ojn,"Felt like it banked on pop culture references and flashy visuals in favor of delivering a great story with a great villain. Sure it’s fun with all its references to look for, including that awesome The Shining sequence, but I’ll probably never watch it again. Our main character didn’t even have much of an arc, and his romance with Olivia Cooke’s character was so cringeworthy. I felt like this film deserved so much more than cool action scenes and Easter eggs.",87yv63
dwne9jf,"Overall an alright movie, but there was a couple of things that seemed off to me. SPOILERS AHEAD. 

I might have missed a few things by not having read the books, but I don't get how OASIS could be so popular given the seeming lack of any rules. Like in that night club scene, where the Sixers suddenly appear and start attacking Z and Arty. I mean, are there no like PVP-zones or anything like that? Is every player vulnerable everywhere? How could anyone survive more than two seconds in a game like that? Also, no private voice chats? Areas that are off-limits to other players where they could hide if needed? If it was a real game, there would be bombs and catalysts going off all the time. There's no way it would be as peaceful as it was portrayed in the movie.

I thought the fighting scenes were graphically very well done, but again, gamewise, there seems to be a massive pay-to-win element. Rich guy gets to use Mechagodzilla and deploy magic impenetrable shields. Why would anyone play a game like that? Maybe this is nitpicking, but OASIS' popularity is the whole basis for the movie. The tech and equipment is already in place, so why wouldn't there be a whole bunch of other VR games available where you aren't at risk losing everything you've accomplished at any point. Everyone has all the gear already, the only thing needed is new software. Speaking of gear, what is the point of using a haptic suit in combat? Especially when literally fighting for your life. Why would you want a kick in the virtual nuts to be felt in reality? That just seems stupid.

The movie also didn't give that much attention to explaining what exactly IOI was about, except being ""evil"". They want to introduce ads into the game? Again, why would anyone play a game like that? OASIS was apparantly already hugely profitable, that would only ruin it and force players to find alternatives. With the entire world as the potential market, there would no shortage of people developing new games to play.

Just my two credits.",87yv63
dx77x54,"Feel free to rip my piece to shreds, but this movie fails.  It was a fun movie to watch (just like how Spy Kids 3 is a fun movie with literally the same plot and same car chase scene) but it fails on a philosophical level. Also warning this is pretty spoiler heavy if you haven't seen the movie.

The whole movie is about an escape from the harsh realities of life and capitalism where [big companies can literally bomb whole neighborhoods with some impunity](#spoiler).  Like many similar movies, the villain is the big corporation who wants to monetize the already heavily monetized Oasis similar to some of the issues going on with the two main influences of the movie: gaming, and the internet.  The issue is by the end nothing really is solved.  The characters regularly engage in the world's economy and IOI is shown to be a major player in that even before the events of the story and the hunt for the egg.  By the end of the movie, they make it [so that the Oasis shuts down a few days a week to enjoy real life](#spoiler) but ultimately the reason for the Oasis still exists.  People still need an escape to their daily life that Oasis provides.  Slajov Zizak talked about in his movie about what happens after the credits role.  Like in Titanic, Rose and Jack would still be seperated by different upbringings and Rose would probably ultimately go back to her old life despite the feel good romance of the movie.  In this movie we see something similar.  The revolution happens with the Oasis ultimately being kept the same and most likely the same economy dominated by big companies like IOI will continue to persist just now the Oasis has a slightly different leader.  The same lack of social intelligence the game encourages will still exist because people will still use the game.  It is similar to EA and their predatory practices and how they still continue to exist after the backlash bc ultimately people are still going to buy a Star Wars game or Shadow of War and what have you.  The Oasis will still be monetized just not in the way Sorrento wanted.  Our main characters may be given money and power to escape their shitty lives but the other players of the revolution will still be confined to their lives.  Sorrento may have actually helped IOI by destroying most of the Oasis's avatars facilitating the need for the players who still live their shitty lives to go out and try and get more loot fueling the loot economy which IOI has shown to have a solid control over.  

Ultimately, nothing changes in the world at the end of the film.  The main characters may just go on to be less lonely Hallidays but the Oasis and its economy still persist and some characters may change  but the natural order of things will still persist with IOI still being the same company as before just with a new leader in charge.  The movie is fun but just feels like another cash cow of a movie that relies too hard on being at best one giant compilation of the same capitalist tendencies it tries to rebel against.",87yv63

dwzsry3,"Just saw it and came here. Gets a ""I didn't love it"" from me. I thought the acting was more or less garbage, the writing was meh and directing meh as well.

Sorrento couldn't say one convincible line that he was a bad guy. All of the lines that were in the ""real life"" characters seemed crappy and horribly contrived. It especially came through on Lena Waithe's lines when she was ""driving"" the postal truck (which was obviously green screen), and I like her a lot in Master of None. I liked all their characters better in the Oasis more, it was convincible and delivered better. The exception was Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg, while their lines weren't great they at least delivered them well.

Directing, I dont know. I'm a grip in real life, I dont judge directors unless their god awful. Overall it was fine, but towards the end with the whole town of the stacks coming in to stop Sorrento, and the minute he pulls out a gun everyone has their tail between their legs. The police showing up out of no where. 

And the final shot of the movie was garbage, having the chair spin around with Wade and Samantha and them kissing and cut to credits. The book ends with Wade leaving the OASIS and spending the rest of his time with Artemis/Samantha somewhere in Oregon which I think would've been way more cinematic. But what do I know, I'm just a grip.

That being said, the delivery was good. The race was awesome, The Shining recreation was awesome, and the final battle was awesome. Production Design/Set Decoration was great. Pop culture icon appearances (basically everything) was great.

i always thought this would be a better movie than a book, and in my opinion it was. however, the movie is still a 5/10 and all 5 points go to the wonderful world that spielberg paints, but doesnt really explain. maybe an extra point for a challenge that was changed. casual movie goers will be entertained but will find an endless list of plot points and details to nitpick.

The references were severely dialed back from the book, which I guess they had no choice. No chance they'd get all those IP's to agree to be in 1 film, but at the same time without them all, it's a bit hollow. 

Also, the RP1 novel seemed simple enough that it could be made into a film without diverting all that much from the source material. Like the book gave you a better sense of just how big the contest was and how famous Wade was. Or how big the Oasis was. The movie kinda felt like Columbus, Ohio had a big lan game.

dwgn1y3,"I really liked the movie, but as a fan of the book I was disappointed by some of the changes they made.

I did like the casting all around, but felt like the writing didn’t serve the depth of the characters beyond Wade—and even his backstory was cut down. Everyone else we just saw brief glimpses of who they are, and I wanted more.

A lot of my critiques are the result of the film taking place over a few days, and so much happened so fast by taking shortcuts. The High 5 is instantly a clan? They all live in Ohio? I-R0k is still a bastard, but now he’s a Bounty Hunter?

It was funny how they shouted out Wade’s school planet, had Aech wearing the Rush shirt, the War Games poster in Halliday’s room, and they listed some key Atari games from the book when the IOI team was naming games. I felt like they tried to compensate with some fan service asides for what they left out.

The challenges in the movie were much more cinematic but also simplified to the point that they didn’t feel nearly as satisfying.

The Shining part was amazing, and I think the movie would’ve benefitted from more sequences like that. We didn’t even get the cool visual remix/mashup of 80s culture from Halliday’s opening message.

The visuals were so incredible in the entire film that I often forgot I was watching CGI, but I felt like they barely delivered on everything the book described. It wasn’t for lack of the ability to pull it off, rather I don’t think they wanted to lean as heavily on pop culture set-pieces that might be too specific?

Granted, The Shining isn’t well-known by younger moviegoers, so it’s interesting they leaned into that so heavily.

We did get lots of characters and Easter Eggs woven in—and there really was something for everyone no matter what era you’re nostalgic for, which was cool, but not as interesting as how the book specifically used 80s pop culture to such an extent.

Instead the movie had more of a 1980s storytelling style to it.

I did like the movie and will probably see it again just to wrap my mind around it all.

But it was probably a mistake to re-listen to the audiobook right before seeing it.

On that note, did I miss a /u/wil Easter Egg? Didn’t notice any mention of him being VP of The Oasis.",87yv63

dwin39x,"Some of my thoughts since I just I got back from watching the film.

I didn't read the book and I went in blind.

The story is nothing novel but I do feel it was executed relatively well.  There was some contrived parts but it wasn't anything too bad.

I'll be bluntly honest other than Wade, Samantha, and Halliday, nobody really had any character depth.  You could argue that Nolan had some but that is more in account of how excellent his actor it.

I liked the supporting cast, Aech, Sho, and Daito were all cool but weren't used a lot.

The bad guys in this film were dumbasses. The main CEO Nolan has all this power and he fucks up royally.  He has all this money and power in the world and he can't properly capture a group of kids?  The other slightly contrived part was how easily Samantha was able to sneak inside his office.  But I'll let that slide since it was a pretty cool sequence on her part.

In terms of romance I didn't really buy it until later the film.  Wade makes one notably dumbass move and surprisingly the film makes him pay for it dearly.

However the lack of development of the side characters hurt this moment. Wade cares about his Aunt Alice dying, I did not.

Also for a film that was criticized from the get go as being pandering nostalgia bait, it was surprisingly self critical of it.  The epitome of the character that lives perpetually in the past, James Halliday is seen as unfulfilled and unhappy with his life. It's a criticism of the quiet nerdy kid that doesn't get out of the house and is too afraid to get out of their comfort zone.  I felt liken that scene and criticism hit home to me because I too struggle with getting out of my comfort zone and being content to live in the past.  For a film that was criticized as something as the epitome of nerd gatekeeping culture, it's surprisingly critical of it, which gives the film more depth.

Visually this film is a feast for the eyes. The only other films that I've watched that really blew me away from it's visuals alone was Avatar and Blade Runner 2049.

There were a lot of fun nerdy references to pick out.  Some of my favorites was the use of ""We're not going to take it,"" and the whole Shining sequence.  However the one moment where my twenty dollar ticket became absolutely worth it was seeing the Iron Giant and Gundam fuck up MechaGodzilla. That scene  if nothing else makes this film worth it.

It helps that we recently got a used Vive off Craigslist and have been having a blast with it, and we watched in IMAX 3d so it really helped immerse you in the world. I'd LOVE to rewatch this in a headset. 

The Shining scene was amazing, my kids have seen it and were able to appreciate what was going on there. I almost feel like watching that would be a prerequisite to seeing this movie. 

I've seen Iron Giant a billion times and I loved the way it was used here. 

The CGI was so impressive - the race, the battle, I can't even imagine how much work went it to creating/choreographing these. I don't understand how anybody is complaining about the poor quality, it was obvious to me that the graphics/textures in certain places (like parzival's avatar) were design choices.

There were also a fair amount of deus ex machina incidents and, maybe not plot holes exactly, but convenient lapses/solutions. I really don't mean to rag on it because honestly, If i was younger, I would most likely eat this up. I'm happy the writer got to realize his story, but the beauty of the concept (oasis), could have been so much more. Just so I'm not solely being harsh, it does have some good chuckles, self aware humor, as well as visually appealing scenery.

There is some suggestion of its harmfulness and the importance of being a person in the real world, but on the whole the attitude seems to be that this would be really fun and awesome. I take issue with that. In a film like The Matrix, a similar story told better, there is an attitude of criticism towards complacency and submission to the hive mind. Its message, embedded under the schlocky action, is to think, individualize, resist, face the hard truths. I found Ready Player One to advocate, in a kind of latent way, complete submission to the pop culture hive mind. There is some gesturing towards an anti-corporate message, that ""the fans"" own this pop culture, but let's be real, that's the furthest thing from the truth. By buying into these pop culture tentpoles without reservation, without criticism, fans are submitting themselves to the corporations that own and control these entities for profit.

I don't know, it's hard to explain.

I'm not upset the movie strayed so far from the book plot, I'm only disappointed that the movie didn't elevate itself above the clumsy source material.

dwlzxgg,"I was afraid it would stray way too far from the book’s main story from the previews with all the rebellion stuff but I really enjoyed it! It felt like an addition to it instead of an omission from it, where we get to see even more of Oasis. It had some great scenes like The Shining, and the humor was on point. Only thing I didn’t like was how quickly the ‘I love you’ came, that was kind of odd to throw in there on their first date. O.o Overall though I was not disappointed. Thumbs up from me.

Also, I’m so glad they didn’t kill the kid, he was so great. ",87yv63

I just wished they would have showed Parzival and Aech’s relationship more and Parzival and Art3mis. Also would have loved to see Wade or ‘Bryce’ get taken by IOI and hack into the sixers database and take the orb’s shield down that way.

dwmgmb4,"After seeing it in 3D, It was another demonstration of why 24fps and 3D are a terrible combination. Not sure what it is about 3D that makes the 'cinematic judder' of 24fps so much worse, but it really does.

So many fast-moving cameras that just turned all those detailed CGI characters and environments into a big mess of judder and blur. Not that it's a unique problem to RPO, most CGI-heavy action scenes have the same problem, but RPO did go for a lot of fast sweeping camera movements that really didn't help.

Still, it was entertaining for a movie of a book that had seemed unfilmable not so long ago. As a fan of the book, the changes went a bit too far, though. Obviously they had to fit a lot into a 2hr20 movie, and they couldn't get the rights to everything referenced by the book - but it just seemed like a little bit too much was lost, both inside the Oasis (what no arcade games, at all, other than background scenery?!) and outside (where the characters meeting up was rushed and far less impactful) ",87yv63

Not to mention the entire thing would be predicated on him never having to scratch an itch or rub his eyes.",87yv63
dwsmm29,"In general I liked the film, and agreed with most of the changes. 

The book had a total of 9 challenges (10 if you count the Pacman game), and showing all of them would've made the movie way too rushed. I liked how the new 3 challenges didn't require Parzival to be superhuman -- they were much more based on puzzle solving than being able to play perfect games of *Joust*, *Dungeons of Daggorath*, *Zork*, *Black Tiger*, and *Tempest*, (and Pacman), as well as knowing every single line of *WarGames* and *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. Frankly, the video games would've been mind-numbingly dull on screen, and I'm sure line-by-line recreations of those movies would've been too expensive. They did keep *Adventure* as the one retro video game, which was fine, and the one ""play this video game"" challenge they did, the car race, translated very well to the screen (and required puzzle solving, not perfect skill). As much as I loved the *The Shining* scene, I found the second challenge to be a bit unbelievably cringy (""ask my best friend's dead wife to dance""), although that may have been the point.

There were a number of plot holes, however, which I found annoying. I can buy that i-R0k was able to use IOI resources to access the customer files of the haptic suit manufacturer (I'll assume that IOI owns a large stake in them), but how did Art3mis' henchman find him based only on a first name? And I had a hard time believing that IOI wouldn't have a way to track where Parzival was logging in from given that he was shown to be using an IOI visor to access the Oasis (and given how morally bankrupt IOI is shown as being, it seems unbelievable that they wouldn't put spyware in their hardware, if for no other reason than to help their ""loyalty"" division).

And how did Aech recognize Wade in the alley? Are we supposed to believe that after Art3mis chewed Parzival out over revealing his first name to her that she turned around and shared his picture with Aech?

I was a bit disappointed in the final battle. Other than Daito's *Serenity*, why were there no other ships involved in the fight? And why didn't i-R0k wait until the gunters were *on* the bridge to blow it up?

And finally, the ending bothered me. It was implied that Halliday had somehow uploaded his conciousness into the OASIS, which would have HUGE societal implications, but it's basically brushed away. As has already been mentioned, shutting down the OASIS two days a week would've been an economic disaster, preventing people (such as the stripper in the stacks) from going to work and kids from attending school.

That said, the movie was fun, and the music was great (I love how Alan Silvestri paid homage to his own *Back to the Future* soundtrack almost every time the DeLorean was on screen). I just with they had extended the running time a bit to fill out the plot holes are give some more background to the rest of the High Five.",87yv63

dwud3ll,"Getting rid of all the ""OH! It's THIS OR THAT REFERENCE!"" every time something came on screen would've improved the movie measurably. We can see it. You don't need to tell us. Sloppy writing. I can't believe Spielberg let that fly. I don't think I've ever been embarrassed watching a film at times, but this one did it. The visuals were fun, but I would've liked less references and maybe more time to see the ones they had. Most everything flew by way too fast.

On the plus side, I thought Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, and TJ Miller were great. Lena Waithe is an amazing writer, and I liked her in Master of None, but here...ehhhh. Tye Sheridan and that awful speech at the end...ooooof. And how were people in the streets moving in the Oasis without movement feedback?

dwgrkyh,"Maybe I’m just a jaded asshole, but I thought this movie was pretty bad. The whole thing felt like a barrage of rather obnoxious “remember this??????” moments. Beyond that, I wasn’t emotionally invested in the movie, mostly because the main relationship was pretty underwritten. I understand that to a lot of people, this isn’t important as they will enjoy all of the references and Easter eggs, but that aspect definitely failed to capture my attention for a near 2 and a half hour runtime, and started irritating me as the movie pretty quickly after the movie began. And sadly, this movie doesn’t offer much beyond that to really make it a worthwhile experience (besides some really cool action scenes, like the race and the battle). Throw in a dash of some cringe-inducing humor and a super boring and cliche villain and you get a movie that definitely fits rather low in my ranking of Spielberg films as a whole.

It's a nightmare.  I was expecting Spielberg to at least give us some characters with pathos and a few well constructed set pieces.

It's not really a love letter to the 80s either - much of the on screen culture spam is just from present day.

Worst of all, even when there is a hint of something compelling onscreen, it's never more than a few seconds before a swooping CGI camera cruises in to undermine drama and ensure your eyes stay glazed.

Ready Player One wants to create a world that takes you out of reality. We already knew there were going to be a shit tonne of references in the film because there are a shit tonne in the book and the trailer. More importantly, the huge diversity of references and characters ARE important in creating this world called the OASIS. The Iron Giant, [Gundam](#spoiler), Tracer etc. all allow you to connect with what is in the world, and enables you to feel like you are a part of this alternate reality. It's not meant to be perfectly true or an exact translation of each character, it's literally there to be fun so you can turn around and go [mechagozilla is fucking fighting the iron giant](#spoiler). 

Sure, the plot isn't the best, but that's not the point of the film.

dx2omsf,"If you read the book and enjoyed it mostly for the nostalgia/references you'll enjoy this movie.

If you read the book and enjoyed it as a love letter to 80s/gaming culture and appreciated the actual puzzle aspects of The Hunt and The Oasis being a larger established world (virtual schools, private chat rooms, etc) and some of the more thought-out aspects of this technology you're gonna have a bad time.  

(If you can switch off emotion responses for your avatar why the hell can't you switch off the rest of your haptic suit when you can't keep a 1-to-1 connection between your body IRL and in-game like, say, if you're getting bounced around in the back of a van and really need your avatar to stand still...)

If you haven't read the book and are just going in for a fun nostalgia-fuel action flick this is a pretty solid choice.

I don't know if I could've written a better screen adaptation but I didn't particularly care for the direction they took the story.  Neither the book or the movie are really going to stand up to serious scrutiny but I liked it better when The Hunt was about proving your knowledge about things Halliday loved rather than simply proving your knowledge about Halliday himself.

Oh and the constant shots with groups of IOI players in their VR gear getting zapped in the exact same orientation as their avatars in the Oasis as if there would ever be a correlation between their physical and in-game locations were very silly design choices.  I get why it looks good on screen but it's just... really stupid.

2. The whole moralistic message about playing video games to avoid real-life problems, and then getting the ultimate reward for doing so.
3. How does society subsist when everyone spends their time in VR?  While not impossible, isn't it a little strange that everyone is reasonably fit in the real world (especially those who can't afford a VR treadmill)?

I didn't enjoy the book due to the characters, dialogue, and Cline's writing but I really enjoyed the adventure and the feeling that if I chose to dig into the lore, I'd just be digging into real pop culture. So I was hopeful that the movie would resolve these problems but the characters were just as thin and the dialogue was just as bad. It also did an even worse job of world building because the oasis doesn't feel necessary. In the book, people go to school and work within the oasis, the earth has also gone to complete shit. Here though, the oasis seems to mostly just be a game and the world doesn't feel much worse than today, so stakes feel kind of low.

Characters show up out of convenience, the romance is rushed and isn't at all believable, there is a bizarre rebellion that's tossed away as quickly as its introduced, and the rules and logic of how everything works just seems bizarre.

Also, what's the point of all these references if you aren't going to have fun with them? Some stuff is well utilized but most of it feels interchangeable. Who cares

It was a bad movie with a few good sequences (the race, the shining, Halladay at the end)",87yv63
dwh238m,"I got an early preview last night. I read the book years ago and loved it, and read it again a couple months ago in anticipation for the movie. Overall, I enjoyed it. It’s fun, cheeky, and pretty much as close to the book as you could hope for. I will say, it’s not necessarily kid friendly due to a couple things. One being explicit language. “Shit” is uttered quite a bit (to the point where it was noticeable), and Spielberg even used the sacred one-time “fuck” rule for PG-13 movies (and I will say, it was played perfectly). There’s also some sexual innuendos (mainly in The Distracted Globe scene…) that were not in the book at all. 

Now with all that out of the way, on to the “review” (which is more or less my comparison to the book). There will be *minor* spoilers in this, so if you read the book feel free to read on because there’s nothing you wouldn’t already know. If you have not read the book I would again caution for some minor spoilers. 

For starters, all of the main characters (Wade, Art3mis, Aech, Daito, Shoto, Sorrento, and Halliday) are portrayed very well. Especially Halliday. Mark Rylance really nailed that role. Their on-screen characters are all very similar as they were in the book (with a slight exception to the appearance of Aech in person). Moreover, all of their avatars are also captured well. 

Some of main themes in the book are somewhat lacking. One of the main themes I got from the book was the lack of human interaction and how it effects the characters, especially Wade. While it is still prevalent in the movie initially, it is not as deep (and, for that matter, as dark) as the book was at times. All of the “big five” characters are all familiar with each other from the start, and they all see each other in person within the first hour of the movie, soon after the first challenge for the Copper Key is undertaken. That’s all fine and good though, and it worked within the movies framework.

Speaking of the Key challenges, none of are the same as they were in the book, which was kind of disappointing; but that is to be expected. You can’t expect an audience to be entertained watching Wade play Joust for hours on end for the Copper Key, or for Wade to go through every line of *War Games* or *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. I will say, without giving away any plot, that one of the quests for one of the keys does follow a similar framework to the book, and it ends up being one of the best scenes in the movie. Funny, thrilling, and a throw back to the 80s that everyone will appreciate and understand. 

Concerning the 80s pop culture theme, it’s definitely there, but again not as prevalent as it was in the book. I read an early review from a critic that said there was “too much” 80s culture to the point where is “almost overwhelming.” I definitely did not have the same sentiment; in fact, there was not enough 80s pop culture references in my mind. Now the book goes into some deep and very obscure references (some of which I was even unfamiliar with). The movie keeps it pretty mainstream, but again that’s also fine. This movie is made for mass audiences, not pop culture junkies.

(There are also plenty of current pop culture references that anyone between the ages of 12-30 would be able to point out.)

That’s pretty much all I can think of at this point. After writing this, one important thing to remember for lovers of the book is that you kind of have to separate it from the book. It’s hard to encapsulate any novel into a movie. But for those that loved the book, it gives you what you want: a fun and thrilling ride. Hope my review was helpful! First time I’ve ever done one of these on /r/movies. I just loved the book so much I couldn’t help myself. ",87yv63

dwyffhq,"This movie is about one real thing, and that's having fun. It's not really a sci-fi movie more than any Marvel movie is a sci-fi movie. Just like Jurassic Park it's not interested in trying to adapt the ""heart"" of the book it's based on, whether you liked it or not. 

The story is conventional and predictable. While I didn't read much of the book, I could sense more moralistic themes and extra plot and etc. behind it that Spielberg, like with JP, mostly ditched because wouldn't fit into a movie or just weren't fun. And while I think the movie could've been 15 minutes longer to fill out Wade's friends a bit more, otherwise it was a great experience. I liked sitting there finding the references, the action scenes are fantastic, and the pacing never lets you get bored.

And at the end I did feel like, for a moment, there was even something special there. I've done stuff in the entertainment industry, including video games. And the very end, [as Wade is playing Adventure, and explaining the easter egg, I think that really sets up the next scene very well. Because when Halliday, played brilliantly by Mark Rylance of course, goes about giving Wade the egg, ending with ""So thank you, thank you for playing my game.""](#spoiler) Well, that part really connected with me. It felt like a big part of why, at their best, people make games and movies and etc, Why people will sit there and spend a decade making a single game, why people will put so much time and effort and etc. into making a single movie. 

It almost felt like Spielberg saying it himself. Saying thank you for watching, and hopefully enjoying my movie. Because that feeling that you brought someone else joy, happiness, or etc. if only for a few hours, or a few moments, is a big part of the reason people make these sorts of things.

dwgqih5,"So, I truly enjoyed the movie, but since everyone said everything that was right (because the movie is fun, beautiful and masterfully directed), I'm gonna say what boggled me in this movie. But most of the flaws in the movie come straight from the book, and I'm upset that they weren't fixed - that could have been a case of a movie better than the book.

First, Sorrento is as unidimensional as it can possibly be. He has one goal, take control of the OASIS, at any cost - just to make profit out of it. [Lacero, a fanfiction written by Mark Weir based on the book,](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/lacero.html) and [considered canon by Ernest Cline](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-author-of-the-martian-wrote-ready-player-one-fan-fi-1766228909), brings more backstory on Sorrento than the entire book and movie. And that's one of my regrets - beside $$$, Sorrento and IOI have no motivation whatsoever.

Second, due to the sheer nature of the story to be pop culture reference pornography, there's no real creation from this movie. At least, from the OASIS itself. I consider the book (and the movie) as a ""giant pop culture remix"". But what ""creation"" will you remember from the OASIS? Nothing is made up from scratch. No original world-building... Except for the real world. The stacks are really incredible.

Because that's a depiction of our own future - and that's gritty, and could have been interesting to explore a bit more. But I understand this is all about the OASIS and it might not be the story to explore the ""gritty anticipation close future"".

Third, OASIS is an escape, but it's not at all a solution to the real-world problems. After all, people have to eat, to drink, electricity and bandwidth have to be provided, and it seems no one has problems with that - it's just barely talked about in the book, and nearly not at all in the movie.

MAJOR ENDING SPOILER HERE - [And the decision the close the OASIS for 2 days a week has a shitty reason. If it was mostly to give the world a ""real"" workforce to get resources so everyone can live without lacking anything, that could be greatly explained - but nope, it's just for the sake of ""the only thing that's real is reality"". There's so much critical thinking that could have been introduced here.](#spoiler)

Also, just putting it as a spoiler, but it's just my own fan theory - [what if the OASIS was the CAUSE of the real world being in such a shitty state? Think about it. Less farmers. Less energy workers. Less ""real workforce"". Who's taking care of the real world if everyone is logged into the OASIS? What if there's a global outage?](#spoiler)

And fourth, well, there's no way that no one even got the first key by ""random"" means in 5 years. It's a flaw shared by the book and the movie. Spoilers for both below.

BOOK SPOILER - [The first key is on the ""school planet"", which Wade realizes after making a connection between the riddle and the location in Latin classes. In 5 years, don't tell me no one made that simple connection that took me 5 minutes to make.](#spoiler)

1ST ACT MOVIE SPOILER - [Wade wins by going backwards at the start of the race. So that means no one in 5 years, even for the sake of fun and YOLO, didn't even try to go backwards at the start line. It always happens once in a while in EVERY online racing game.](#spoiler)

So yeah, the movie is as enjoyable as the book (which I VERY enjoyed), and despite being very different, it suffers from the exact same flaws.

dwhro10,"First and foremost i'll say the movie is so disimilat from the book in almost all aspevts aside from characters and a few large plotpoints that comparing the two is an act of futility. But to say briefly I feel that the adaption handled Wade better and not as the overly heroic/mary sue type the book portrays him as at times, and overall the themes are handled in a more accessible/natural way.

Speaking just on the film, the biggest issue I had with it was pacing. The first half to 2/3rds of the film were break neck at setting up the world/conflict, but never gave is time to really live in it and get a proper sense of atmosphere. By the time the third act rolls around it does settle out better and the final battle is fantastic. However the last few scenes following Wade's respawn are a but rushed/not sure how they want to handle their sense of tension.

On the positive side I like how this seemed to pay greater homage to films than the book did to video games, as it made more sense within the genre. The animation was beautiful and The Shining sequence was absolutely picture perfect. The characters all feel lived in and realistic, however because of the prior mentioned pacing issues, sometimes their swiychijg in opinions feels hypocritical.

Overall very enjoyable and probably exactly what you expect. It mantains a sense of adventure and mystery solving that is the best aspect both here and in the book. 7/10 for now, but i'd like to see it again without my preconceptions from the book influencing me as much.",87yv63

I loved the cameos by all kinds of characters... wanted a bit more, but I image this was a licensing nightmare.

dwl5qrb,"Honestly, if this movie had been directed by any other director I would have been happy with it. It was a fun but shallow movie with more references than you can shake a stick at. (Seriously, I wanted to shout, ""WHOA, A KRULL REFERENCE!?"" in the theater. That was one I never expected in a million years.) But this movie was directed by Spielberg. I expected more heart. He's the one director who can take the weirdest, most outlandish, crazy, over the top situations and find the grounded, down to Earth, heart of it. (ET? Oh, I cried. AI? Yep, tears all around for me too.) But RPO didn't have it. It was more talk about it than showing it. Like how Halliday's biggest regret was loss of Morrow's friendship or at least that's what the movie said. I didn't see that at all. I saw a guy hung up on Kira. Not regretting the loss of friendship. Halliday never showed any real emotions about that loss. Instead, he put in a picture of him and Kira up in the Overlook, had her being in the dancing scene, having him and Morrow talking about her. But there were never any real scenes of Halliday regretting what he did with Morrow. No him being alone. The fact that Morrow still worked for Halliday and had his lawyers with him in the end, made little sense to me. Were Halliday and Morrow in different departments? How did that even work? 

I am still having a hard time deciding whether Watts was just a seriously shallow character or was Sheridan's performance sub-par. Spielberg is usually fantastic with actors, especially young actors, see ET and Empire of the Sun for amazing examples, but here barely anyone stood out for me. Lena Waithe stood out for me. And Mendelsohn and Miller had their comedic moments. But nothing that I would remember when it came to the rest of Spielberg's filmography. 

RPO is going to be one of those movies that will be fun to watch at home over and over to list all the references. But it won't be remembered much beyond that. There is no, ""Life finds a way,"" ""Earn this,"" or ""ET, phone home"" heart touching factor to it. Still, hey, that Glaive reference was cool. ",87yv63

Also thought it was hilarious that it ended the movie with Wade saying, “We closed the OASIS two days a week” and then show him making out with Artemis on a chair. Like maybe show people actually enjoying life outside?? I don’t know, I just thought it was an odd choice.

It started out strong. I loved the race scene and Parzival running it backwards from below the track geometry. I pretty much liked everything up until the moment that IOI burst into the club and started shooting. After that, it became a string of incredibly convenient nonsense that felt amazingly rushed for a 2.5 hour movie.

By the time they got to the 3rd challenge and just dismissed almost the entire thing with “IOI already figured out the first half, so we can just cut straight to the climactic battle” without actually showing how the clue led to playing an old game in that castle on Planet Doom or whatever, it felt like they had kinda given up and just wanted to get to the finale as quickly as possible.

Then there was stuff like Parzival telling Artemis he loved her after knowing her for like a day, the entire group of friends just happening to all apparently be from the same city within 10 minutes of each other so Aech could just happen to show up out of nowhere with the two others after Parzival escapes the IOI raid, how Aech was able to perfectly replicate an office she’d never seen to trick Sorento, how i-r0k was able to search names and addresses of everyone named Wade who bought a haptic suit (how does he have access to do this?), how people were running around in the real world while logged into the Oasis without constantly bumping into real objects when every other logged in player we’d been shown was strapped into a harness on a treadmill of some sort, why the villain would drive to the Stacks himself with a handgun to attempt to murder Parzival in full public view and how he expected to get away with that, how IOI was able to abduct people and hold them prisoner complete with electro-shock torture and raid buildings with attack drones and SWAT-esque teams without the police intervening, how Parzival was able to stream video to every single person in the Oasis (Jesus, talk about an exploitable feature), how that curator robot could actually be Ogden...so, like, do people ocassionally go to Halliday Journals for research and that curator isn’t there, and does Ogden just log in and then stand at a desk in the Oasis all day? Etc, etc. Things just happened because the plot wanted them to happen regardless whether they made any sense and then you were expected to just accept them and not think too hard.

As a young individual who remembers the past (from youtube videos and the like) and understood basically everything in the film I enjoyed the creative parts and the MMO/Oasis parts a lot.

My gripe, and a lot of others' problems with the movie stem with the story, the characters, and while for me it wasn't a problem the film felt like a 80s-90s movie tonally (Like in the end of the movie [Where the bad guy gets put into the police car with the bad girl in it already and he tries to explain himself and then just gets hit in the face by the pissed off bad girl, that felt really comedic and spontaneous and totally like a ""ah shucks"" moment that was in 80s-90s kids/teenage comedy adventure movies that always had a romance like in this movie.](#spoiler))

The Main Characters are Wade Watts/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis. The rest of the group such as Parzival's best friend Aech/H, and their gaming buddies in Daito and Sho don't really have any character building moments and they do not really have anything they bring to the table (They could really just not appear in a lot of scenes because they were just glorified extras in most of them, they looked cool tho. Their only purpose was for the Final Battle sequence).

7.5/10. This film all in all is a fun ride and very beautiful to watch in cinema and if you can put away some plot holes (such as but not limited to things that are just swept under the rug and never talked again), a forced connection/romance, and thin characters besides the two Main Characters, the Steve Jobs-esque Game Creator, and kinda the Villain.",87yv63

I saw this movie yesterday and I still haven't been able to wrap my head around it. There was so much happening. I appreciate that Spielberg decided to take another direction from the book because it got a better balance of VFX and live action. The VFX made me smile with wonder every time Parzical uncovered another challenge, while the real world let me unimpressed. The avatars' traits where more realistic than their real life personas. I knew who they wanted to be (personalized by their avatar form), who they are, but there was not enough time to really connect these together through the real life scenes. 
There was definately a lot happening, yet Spielberg is able to explain everything simply enough for everyone to keep track and never lose interest. My head is all over the place with this one.

dwn3ow3,"To be honest I'm blown away that so many people like this movie so much. There were so many moments that just made me sit up and go ""What the fuck"" that, when the movie did nail something (and it nailed many parts) I didn't care as much.

I guess I'll get the positives out of the way:

1. I-Rok/TJ Miller. Miller nailed this part, and I-Rok was written perfectly. Without a doubt the best part of the movie. 

2. All of the challenges for keys. While I prefered the system of keys/gates in the book, and the challenges themselves, I enjoyed every single challenge in the movie as well.

3. The final battle Gundam vs Mechagodzilla was not something I knew that I needed to see - turns out it was. 

4. Ogden Morrow. I loved his character in the book and was very happy with how the movie handled it.

As for the stuff I didn't like:

1. Anything that involved Parzival and Art3mis talking to each other. It was cringe inducing - maybe it was a little close to home because I've seen a lot of online relationships between friends, but honestly it felt so poorly written.

2. The little character development there was is completely inexplicable, for the most part. While one can argue Parzival grows as a character through the journey, Art3mis finally being comfortable with her birthmark because Parzival says he likes it? Sorrento magically becoming a non-prick at the end and tearing up at the sight of the egg? And those are the only characters that developed in *any* way - Sorrento's henchwoman never had any character, Shoto, Daito and Aech were done a huge disservice (and Aech and Shoto still nailed it IMO), and there simply weren't characters relevant to the plot beyond those ones.

3. Completely inexplicable plotholes. Art3mis texts Aech, Shoto and Daito and they immediately find Parzival minutes later in the alley? Nobody in five years driving backwards at the race just randomly? Aech (whose character I liked) *NEVER HAVING SEEN THE SHINING?* IoI not jumping right to Adventure, the first game with an Easter Egg, and deciding to *NOT FIND THE FUCKING EASTER EGG?* The ""resistance"" knowing where Wade was living and being ready to pick him up before IoI?

dwt18gx,"Very funny to me that most the general consensus seems to be that those that read the book (myself included) were much more pleased with the film than those that didn't. Probably a testament to how bad the book's plot actually is. 

I enjoyed myself coming in with some of the lowest expectations possible. I thought it would be intolerable with how many references were placed in front of me combined with being one long VR advertisement. I was pleased with how both those aspects turned out, especially the way references were generally quick and not necessarily the sole focus of the frame they were in. I think that was super smart by the film as far as building its rewatchability. 

It's hard to have read the book and not see a lot of what's being pointed out as legitimate faults of the film as nothing more than improvement on the source material. They made Art3mis way better as a character, made Wade a way better character, and had a good end-theme albeit entirely unrealistic to the world (Although, pulling him out of school and not focusing on how reliant everyone is on OASIS for jobs and things means shutting it down for a few days a week isn't as detrimental to society.) 

Most fun parts for me were when Spielberg referenced his own work, and was really impressed with the second key's set design. And then I was smiling in the almost absurdist ending. Worth the money I didn't spend, and as a MoviePass user might be a film I see a second time in theaters.",87yv63

Also when Samantha first meets the High Five in real life she is surprised by the postal van so she didn't know what kind of vehicle Aech had.

They did a great job of sticking with the spirit of the story \- while streamlining it to meet the needs of film. Don't get me wrong \- if they had made a 6 hour movie that perfectly mirrored the book \- I would have preferred that. However if they went that route \- they would have likely lost anyone's interest who wasn't already bought into RP1 from reading the book. If you haven't read the book...

But right now all I want to say is that I love the Iron Giant so much, he is one of my favorite film characters of all time, and his inclusion gave me the movie high I'm looking for. Everyone watching the movie probably has that one character or reference that does it for them. It's just awesome to see The Iron Giant given all this iconography 19 years after his movie came out. I know the movie is pretty well known but what I'm trying to get at here is that I love that movie so much and it was nice to see him be awesome again. They maybe could have done more or had him talked but I love what we got. ",87yv63

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with Ready Player One. The digital world of the Oasis was a little overwhelming at first and I did not start connecting to the characters until the real Art3mis showed up.

I grew up in this era and only got half of the references and sure I missed quite a bit of the visual references. But the overall movie was enjoyable and you can certainly see the ""old"" Spielberg in certain sequences. I liked it. I might see it again. Thank God for Movie Pass.",87yv63

I gave up after about 10 minutes trying to spot all the references, the thing was just so dense! One of my favourites was Parzival wearing Han Solo's gun belt with a thunder cats logo on the buckle. And the Delorean looked like a million bucks!  

It did take me a few minutes to warm up to the Oasis and the avatars, but overall i think the effects were amazing. And the cast did a great job of getting me invested. Have to say i'm a little disappointed TJ Miller wasn't given more to do.

Overall i have to hand it to Spielberg, I'm not sure anyone else could have made this movie, and given it the heart it needed. It makes me happy to see him making these kind of movies again. In recent years he has focused on more ""grown up"" films. But this was a great reminder that he never lost that ""Spielberg"" magic. 

And a final note to Alan Silvestri. I was sad to hear John Williams wouldn't be scoring a Spielberg film, but i think Silvestri did a great job. Especially all the little Back to the Future references he put in there. I didn't come away being able to pick out the main ""theme"" but the music never once took away from the film. I think Alan Silvestri did the film a great service, and I am looking forward to seeing what he brings to Infinity War. ",87yv63

Now for the negatives:The characters could have been a lot more fleshed out (specifically wade, Nolan and halliday).The story and dialogue also could have been a lot stronger.Also, Nolans sudden change at the end didn't make that much sense narratively.He was a sociopath that showed no signs of changing, yet had a sudden change of heart at the end.

dwwa774,"I didn't like the movie and I know some did which is fine but I'm going to write down everything I didn't like to get it out of my mind

* So someone finds out the clue to the first challenge we never find out who it is or how they did it. Which completely takes away from the main characters. It makes them seems like random smucks who aren't insanely versed in all things halliday and eighties culture. It steals parzivals eureka moment and makes him just lucky
* Really? The answer to the challenge wasn't hidden or  in a riddle. Just in a famous clip of hallidays. So somehow in spite of the fact every inch of his life and everything he said was gone over with a fine tooth comb no one had two brain cells to rub together and make the insanely obvious connection that he says ""go backwards fast"" to the race their all trying to win every day? Again this takes away from the main character instead of figuring out some obscure clue he just uses his ears for two seconds.

* Artemis is now the leader of some stupid resistance movement. Which not only makes no sense since to the character, comes out of left field for no reason.  They bumped into some intern carrying yet another teen fiction dystopian  future script and got their pages mixed together. It messes with her whole character arch and  somehow manages to turn her into a generic love interest instead of the actual badass she was in the original story. It also takes away from Wade's character again as it destroys his awesome third act plot of breaking into ioi and  essentially taking them out from the inside to stop the or.

* Aech hasn't watched the shining despite it being on hallidays most loved movies. Again let's turn the characters into smucks who don't even resemble their original characters. Aech would have the entire movie memorized. As would every member of the high five 

* I rok being anything other then an annoying idiot who thinks he's better then he is and serves any other purpose then to idiotically leak the first keys location is stupid
 But to make him some big bad muscle to the big bad is so stupid I rolled my eyes whenever he was on screen

* So I guess not only does daito get to live now he's a ninja? His death in the book was a huge blow and is what helped sparked the rest of the high five to begin working together. Which is my next nitpick

* The high five didn't instantly congeal as team. They were all in it alone with the exception of diato and and shoto. Even parzival and aech  were competing against each other. It was a major plot point that none of them trusted each other and even when they came together in the end it was out of necessity to stop ioi who were gaining on them

* Og may have well have not existed in this version.

* They got rid of the gates. Which makes the three challenges way to easy. In the book getting the key is only part of it and you have to find where the gate to the key is as well. Which was alot more challenging  and figures into the plot multiple times. Including how i gets ahead of them.


I feel like they took the basic plot and characters and nothing else. Overall I suppose it's not a bad movie and I've certainly seen worse adaptions but I certainly won't be watching this ever again

dwnidqk,"Well, that internet “backlash” was all over nothing. If you didn’t like the movie or book, fine. I for one found it a fun, sci-fi adventure romp that never got boring despite being nearly two-and-a-half hours long. If you read the book, it’s almost nothing but nostalgic references, and the screenplay wisely knocked that down a bit while still paying homage to the source material and that which inspired it. 

Mendelsohn is amazing like he always is and Cooke again shows herself as being one of the best actors of her generation.

dwgotff,"Parzival and Art3mis’s relationship was condensed to the point of feeling absurd. Both his “I love you” at the dance club and how serious she felt for him when they met in real life.

I know the book got criticized for making Art3mis feel like a digital version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but some of her intelligence and strength, the depth of their relationship, and most of her insecurity were completely lost here.

She was toned down and less interesting aside from her backstory. In the book she had no personal grudge against IOI but even with having her get captured, the indentured servitude portion was so rushed.",87yv63

dwj2qa8,"Idk, I'm a bit mixed about the whole thing. As previously stated, I really loved the look and feel of the OASIS and the action scenes were absolutely gorgeous. But the stuff in the real world was just, meh. I know in the book we don't exactly get deep character development, but it was even more paper thin in the film, which was kind of a bummer. Also the fact that in five years, no one would ever think to drive backwards in a race that happens everyday.

With all that said I still had a fun time, but it's not a classic or even great, just fun.

 Really the most bothersome stuff to me is you have I-Rok who is supposed to be this badass mercenary and yet you have TJ Miller playing TJ Miller as a mercenary with just his regular annoying ass voice that I felt didn't fit that kind of character at all. Also the fact that everyone in the world uses the OASIS, and everyone you meet could be anywhere in the world. And yet you're telling me that the five most significant people in the film all fucking live in Ohio? Like, right next to each other? I get they all need to come together in the real world, but I feel like they could have done something similar to the book and not have five people who randomly met online literally live right next to each other in the real world.

When Daito say ""I choose the form of Gundam!"" and he transform into RX-78, instant nerdgasm. Everyone in my theater was cheering. Fcking love that moment. I wish the Gundam and Mechagodzilla fight scene were longer.

dwl5ryg,"I haven't read the book, but I've heard a lot of things about the book that honestly make me think I wouldn't like it. I'd have no problem with constant 80s nostalgia porn, but I've heard from a lot of different people on different occasions that the book not only somehow manages to make that boring at times, but that it's also full of other unsavory aspects of nerd culture like gatekeeping and niceguy-ism and so on. Thus I went into the movie with low expectations, and I mainly just saw it because I hoped it would be fun.

I can't lie, that was the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time. I really liked how the 80s nostalgia porn was expanded into geek porn in general. There were obviously *tons* of references, but most of them were just background details for you to notice if you caught them. The few that were actually front and center or important to the story were either so ubiquitous that either most people will be aware that they exist already if they're not familiar with them, or they were explained tastefully in a sentence or two without dwelling on them for too long. Basically it was full of nerd culture reference porn, but I never felt like it took too much time to jerk itself off over it.

Additionally, none of my worst fears of what I'd heard about the book came true. I actually found it really funny how the female lead mock-gatekeeps the male lead for a few lines, and even that doesn't stick around for long enough to really get awkward. There were a *couple* of things that I took issue with, but honestly I had a good enough time with everything else that I didn't even care anymore by the next scene.

Sure, the characters are arch and the plot is essentially just an actionized Willy Wonka story, but those elements of the movie do just enough to keep it afloat. What elevates it is virtually everything else it does. I've said this in probably every other comment I've made about this movie too, but it really is just a love letter to everything that's good about nerd culture, and it also manages to keep from overindulging itself and slipping into the darker facets of it. I hope I can find the time to go and see this one again.",87yv63
dwmosgt,"I love the movie. The love plot line is off key for sure but the tone of the movie is exactly how it is in the book. 

For a 2.5 hours film, it doesn't drag at all. In  fact I think it needs at least another 30 minutes to really capture all the trials and tribulations of parzival, especially all the puzzle solving and more in-oasis IOI conflicts. 

All the actors are on point and actually look like what I pictured them to be, especially Halliday.  The IOI leader acting, though,  could be a little less goofy though.  He comes out pretty threatening at first but turns too much into a parody at the end. 

As a Street fighter fan, seeing both Ryu showcased in the film and the fact that Parzival actually does a hadouken in final fight scene just brings tears to my eyes. Haha.   It would be cool if he actually loaded the Ryu armor ( a la Monster Hunter World ) , and became Ryu for a brief moment. Oh well. ",87yv63

dwu4vo8,"So, I went to see the movie the same day I finished the book. I was severely disappointed.

Most of my childhood comes from 80's video game and movie nostalgia and reading the book sends me back to my own past and touches something deep. Everything from the movies reinacted in the book to old pizza arcades being referenced really sent me back. Even the social awkwardness of Holliday's book character really hit home.

This movie was a complete let-down full of Spielberg self-indulgence and light entertainment and basically dropped the ball on the very idea and narrative driven from the book.

If I wasn't so attached to the nostalgia from the book, the movie would have probably still been a forgettable visually-pleasing mess.",87yv63
dwz4y65,"A little corny in parts (mostly when it cuts back from epic scenes in the Oasis to the real world with the characters moving around with goggles on their face doing nothing), love story was a bit rushed (shouldn't have said he loved her after meeting her twice; should have waited until the end; the book makes it clear it takes place over a much longer period) but overall a pretty good movie. The 1st key race sequence was ear-to-ear smiles. 2nd key Shining reenactment was hilarious (and I haven't seen the Shining either). I wish it would have spent a bit more time in the real world though. Ben Mendelsohn was great, however, I just wish they would have made his henchwoman more fleshed out.

I-Rok stole the show. I saw it in 3D and it's the first 3D film I've seen that I didn't regret seeing in 3D. It actually got the aspect ratios right and the real world scenes weren't 3D, just the Oasis scenes and it did them brilliantly",87yv63

Seeing it at Universal just a stone's throw away from Spielberg's office, it's like drinking a scotch that was distilled in that area. Yeah, there were easy plot point problems, it strayed away from the book, yadda yadda, but it was just so MUCH FUN. I actually got a bit emotional at one point, not because of the story, but the whole nostalgia trip and the fact that for 40 years, Spielberg is still fucking entertaining me. I was just happy that he is still making great movies at this time and age. A great night overall, worth the wait and worth every penny of the most I've ever paid for a movie. Easily one of the best theatrical experiences of my life. Thank you again, Steven. 

EDIT: E.T. was the first movie I saw in the theater at 4 years old and made me fall in love with movies. So Spielberg has taken me on a wild ride my entire life.

But I really liked a lot of the changes and I loved that they changed the War Games part with the Shining part because holy sh*t that was great. I couldn’t believe my eyes when they stepped into the Overlook Hotel (and boy it would have been boring to see them reenact War Games quotes instead)
I think they made the best possible -movie- from this book and I sat with a giant smile all the way through it.

The characters were the real week point here though.  The only character with any real development was Halliday, the game creator. The rest had virtually (ha!) no depth.

dwo9756,"I came into the movie not expecting much given how I read reviews of the source material being like a male Twilight with it being a power nerd fantasy. Moreover, the protagonist apparently spend some pages talking about how masturbation is necessary, how hard nerds have it with getting a girl, and how he later stalked Artemis to win her back. 

That said, the reviews convinced me to see the movie, and I actually was entertained by it. It was your basic Spielberg kids against society/adults movie adventure if not shallow and a bit predictable. I will say that the story at least does a good job of escalating stakes and creating tension with constantly hurling obstacles at our protagonist. Visually, the movie is also a treat and you can see all the action clearly despite how hecktic some scenes are. You can also follow the movie along without having to recognize all the pop culture and gaming references. 

Actual story and character wise though.... it's more flat. Some rather convenient coincidences like all the friends living in the same city. There's a lot of exposition drop by characters to explain things. Have you noticed how just about every adult character is evil save for the game's creators? That said, Nolan's motivation for being evil is simply to be more rich. Meanwhile, henchwoman Hannah John-Kamen's role felt very similar to the henchwoman in Blade Runner 2049. 

Wade's ""I love you"" for Artemis seem to be based on finding her game character hot? They never really seem to connect much other than playing the games with each other and Artemis sharing her backstory with her Dad. Not to mention, how does Artemis fall for Wade anyway? Just because of the race track trick? I kind of expected her to betray him at some point. Then there's the whole ""oh woe is me, I'm ugly because of a birthmark even though I'm an attractive girl.""  That's like your typical ""oh noes I'm ugly because I have glasses on"" troph. Imagine if Lena Waithe was actually Artemis, now that would be interesting.  

Some things I don't get about the VR headset. Is the ingame movement exactly one for one? Does that mean you actually need to know martial arts to do a lot of the moves in the game? The headset doesn't block out background noise? At some point I remember Sam saying something and Wade was able to hear it.  ",87yv63

The changes from the book fit pretty well with the movie and it still gave me the feel of the book (not taking itself super serious).  A couple of the sets (especially The Stacks and the dance club) looked about exactly how I imagined them.

The characters in particular. No characters are introduced or developed, so they really are just cardboard avatars. And before you say it doesn't matter, watch Guardians of the Galaxy for a comparison.

dwihm3b,"Okay here I go. People call this movie a Nostalgia Trip, which don't get me wrong a good portion of it is. But allow me to throw out my reasons why I loved it from start to finish. Before going further I'd like to state right now, I haven't read the book, but I do intend to. That being said.

I mean three things carried it for me.

1. As a gamer, the entire idea of The Oasis is exactly what I want. I real virtual world I can escape to when I want or need to. The entirety of it had me almost at tears nearly everytime I saw it because THAT'S what I want. In fact when they dive into the reason why Halliday created it, it just hit me hard in my heart. I looked at Wade Watts/Parzival, and I saw myself. A socially awkward kid, who fell in love with video games and uses it as his means to get through the hard days and temporarily escape from the cold harshness of reality, even if for an hour. As a gamer this movie showed the future that I want for Gaming.

2. Seeing all the pop culture icons that I could in the limited 2 hour-ish time frame of the movie was such a treat. I had a blast seeing characters like Harley Quinn, the Ninja Turtles, the Spartans from Halo, the Iron Giant, King Kong, MechaGodzilla, fucking Chucky, etc. etc. It had me feeling ""HOLY SHIT I KNOW THIS! I KNOW THAT! I KNOW IT ALL!"" So yes the nostalgia trip did help.

3. The story, while as cliched and ""overdone"", it still was fun to see. In a way it's your typical ""Bad guy wants to rule the world, good guys won't let him"" story, I say ""In a way"" because the dude wants to rule a virtual world and not the real world, but anyway, using elements that I'm beyond familiar with (gaming and pop culture) it was especially enjoyable and I fell in love with it.

I love this movie. I genuinely love it.",87yv63
dwlu75z,"I really enjoyed this movie, I've not read the novel, the draw of 80s nostalgia and Spielberg brought me to watch it. Did not disappoint.
My only gripe is I've got a hard time believing that all the players in the OASIS can function thier avatars using thier bodies while like, in thier houses, or on the street etc. Obviously at the start we see Wade has a treadmill thing to move around on, fair enough, but there are people in the OASIS who are stood in the streets etc.
Something maybe more in the style of the Matrix where the players are jacked in and the brain interacts with the game instead of the body would have been more realistic.

Besides, it didnt bother me too much, really enjoyed the movie and I'd probably go see it again.",87yv63

Also, let's be honest there were a few parts that made no sense and were downright stupid. For example, why were some people strapped onto omni-directional pads while others were just running around their living rooms or in the middle of the street? Imagine all the injuries. Some were even sitting down to play, like our main bad guy who somehow manages to fight while seated in his fancy chair. It didn't make much sense. They should have all been using the omni-directional pads for it to be slightly realistic. 

And I really think they could have cut down on some of the cornyness had they refrained from constantly showing what the people currently playing looked like from an outside perspective. They looked stupid flailing their arms around fighting invisible enemies, or when they showed H stomping around the van while she piloted the Iron Giant in game. Nobody looks cool while playing VR, you always look like a doof, so why show it so much? ",87yv63

I absolutely get the nostalgia hype, don't get me wrong here, and I did enjoy some references and the general feel of a few scenes, for example the one when Watts [finally receives the egg from Halliday](#spoiler). But these details weren't even REMOTELY able to outweigh the utter shallowness and superficiality of the movie as a whole. 

Empty characters with not even a flicker of believable personalities and no development whatsoever, a world (of which you only get a couple glimpses anyway) with almost no background nor sense of scale, typical cardboard bad guys who're just serving as punchbags for protagonists and whose motivations make no sense at all, awfully pointless, terrible attempts at humor, and tragic attempts at acting that make even Jennifer Lawrence shine in comparison.

The race at the beginning was so enthralling, thanks to amazing directing by Spielberg. The way the scene was shot made it like you were right in the mix which made is so much fun. The Shining scene was also excellent and had a lot of my crowd cheering and laughing, weirdly enough. The final battle at the end was just utter batshit awesomeness. It really felt so epic and grand with all these characters that I know and love fighting side by side. The scene with Halliday at the end saying ""Thank you for playing my game"" was so satisfying and just a great way to end the film. The actors, Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke did a really good job, although I agree with some people saying their relationship wasn't that developed and such but it didn't really affect me. Ben Mendelsohn as Nolan Sorrento was actually a really good villain which was quite surprising to me. His negotiation scene with Wade was excellent and his anger throughout the film was very entertaining.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Ready Player One as it was a really fun ride. There were some issues such as minimal character development and subplots that weren't really delved in much, but its visuals, acting and epicness won me over.

I loved a lot of it, especially the Zemekis Cube and the appropriate music, Gundam, and Iron Giant. The graphics were really great, and the look and feel of the Oasis was spot on.

There was a lot missing though. The biggest thing? Danger! Everything was too easy! The book has the same issue, with Wade becoming a super spy infiltrator with no relevant training at all. At least the movie got rid of that and had Art3mis get captured instead. I like that she pretty much rescued herself, but still it was too easy. After the Aunt died, nobody else died. I didn't feel like the characters were in real danger until the very final sequence.

I also hated Artemis being all 'oh I'm ugly no one will love me' when she's drop dead gorgeous and supposed to be kicking ass. It's not as bad as in the book, but she was still a prize for the Straight White Male to win at the end.

- The addition of The Shining was awesome. 
- I figured Rush wasn't going to play as big of a role as the book, but I was bummed it got deduced to a poster on the wall and a shirt.
- I really wanted them to keep the first challenge from the book the same in the movie. The race looked awesome, but I didn't buy it for a minute.
- IOI was cartoonishly incompetent. The death of a certain character from the book at IOI's hands made them much more dangerous and willing to do whatever it took to win. Although B055man69 was funny, have to admit.
- I hated how rushed everything was. While I'm usually against it, I think splitting the movie in two parts would have served it much better. We don't get a good feel for the economic effect the Oasis has. I loved Wade talking about living in episodes of Sesame Street in the book.

Overall, I'd say it's worth a view in the theater. I saw it in 3D, which was worth the extra bucks. ",87yv63

I would say this is the best videogame movie we're ever gonna get. Forget direct adaptations this movie encapsulates the feeling I get when playing videogames. That's what I look for in all these other videogame movies.

There are some real problems in the movie of course, mostly the long exposition dialogue. Some characters are introduced as important but you don't really understand why.

I don't know if it's because I've outgrown the novelty of this kind of gimmick, or maybe if the execution could have been better -- because I just didn't find myself getting excited over them. Like, wow. The main protagonist is driving a DeLorean from Back to the Future in a race. Yeah, ok. Everyone knows what that is, big deal. It's not being used as a clever plot device or anything. There's not some kind of funny or dramatic reveal. It's just there, just because. If anything, it sort of shows how normalized it is to have pop-culture shit show up in online games. It's not special or surprising. It's just to be expected. So I by no means hate or am turned off by all the pop-culture stuff. In fact it would be dumb NOT to have that. It's just that I don't understand all the gushing over it.

I would actually say I don't think they went FAR ENOUGH with the pop-culture references. It was all mostly Warner Bros. and Spielberg properties, of course. And that's what took me out of the movie. At times it felt like Spielberg was jerking his Hollywood friends off (A Zemeckis Cube, really?) rather than envisioning an actual virtual reality world. I might have lost my shit if I saw a lot of unexpected Disney properties, Nickelodeon stuff, internet memes and tons more obscure things. Yeah, not really practical because of licensing.

I’m 31 and loved that they tailored more of the references to my generation. I enjoyed the book’s references too, but the Atari 2600 stuff was before my time...

I also can totally forgive the clumsiness and awkwardness of the romance. The guy was obviously a fan boy and was socially awkward. It didn’t seem unbelievable to me at all... and her rejection of it was perfect. If she hadn’t rejected it, then yes, it would’ve been poorly written.  But remember that these are actors who were intentionally made to look LESS attractive than they actually are.. just to try to convey that they aren’t the “cool kids”.

My only gripe with the movie is the pacing. It really seemed to jump ahead in places without clear indications that time had passed. The Aech rescue of Z from the building for instance... Z had to have hidden there all night to give Aech time to get there.. but that wasn’t explicitly shown. The finding of the third clue was another huge pacing issue... it just leaped forwards to that point.

But I understand that at 2.5 hours already, it makes sense for some trimming to be done. That makes me excited for a directors cut or an extended version. Oh gosh, that would be amazing. 

My favorite reference was the golden eye 64 .. playing as oddjob on “slappers only”.  Who plays as oddjob on slappers only?! A horrible friend, that’s who.

It had the plot of just about every generic kids movie, evil business man wants to take our playground and would have gotten away with it but for these meddling kids.

And worst of all, lots of chances to make an interesting movie, something like a modern Brave New World but forsook all of them to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

Strip away the lame references and the movie straight sucks with horrible, horrible exposition. 

Embarrassing to sit through. More Spy-Kids 3D: Game Over or Sharkboy and Lava Girl than Tron.

- Why don’t the players (like i-ROK) just take off their goggles/log out when the nuke is detonated? Why just run away?

- Love story was weak and Wade’s obsession with Artemis is almost non-existent.

- H is dressed like a Fat Albert character.

- BO55Man69 was funny, I guess.

- Mark Rylance did a great job playing Dana Carvey’s Garth doing a Willy Wonka impression.

- Everything was super on the nose

- CGI was horrible, no idea what people are talking about.

- If people risk losing everything, and losing everything is so tragic to people that they’ll literally kill themselves in real life, then why are all the battles just giant mosh pits and why does everyone race so wildly? You would think they’d play slower and more strategically versus just running in and firing in all directions.

- In four years nobody thought to fucking back up their car during the race? Give me a break. Play and video game and you’d know people would try going backwards in a race in like 10 seconds. This. Was like my mom finding out about different ways to play video games, not something you’d expect from gamer veterans.

- Gamer lingo felt like someone googled ‘Gamer lingo’ and used it all. It was whack, even for a sci-fi game. Nobody uses the term ‘avatar’ in real life.

- The references were over the top to the point of being just embarrassing. Mendelshon talking John Hughes was funny, but they should have saved it. Every line being a reference made my soul ache. Anyone who though Deadpool was too blatant should stay far away.",87yv63

So.

Spoiler free review.

In a few words: If you go into this wanting the book, you will be disappointed. This is definitely much more a 90s/00s pop culture fest than an 80s fest, but it is just as good a love note to that generation as the book was to the 80s. As good a love note to gamers imo as Wreck it Ralph. It’s just as heartfelt as the book, and you can feel the love and heart put into this. It’s like... They obviously changed a lot of things, book to movie and all, but it honestly felt like a different story but set in the same universe as the book, not something completely different, and it inspired the same magical feeling.
Changed a lot of things around, made it a much more compact story than an 18 month odyssey. For the better honestly. The movie does drag a bit in the middle, but the sandwich of the beginning and ending are fucking excellent. 
It’s much more than a cameo fest, there’s extremely little cringe to my surprise, and the action sequences were so heart poundingly good my Fitbit counted it as cardio.

The final battle. Oh. My. God. I cried and cheered in the theater and a few other people were screaming too.

I give it a glowing pass as a huge fan of the book.

It has great sequences of action, with absolutely stunning visuals. Although the story is cliche and fairly by the numbers it still has alot of heart. The characters are likeable and a pretty accurate representation of video gamers. 


Yes there are plenty of pop culture video game references, however that doesn't bring the movie down, but it rather elevates it. 


Then humor is there, but it's not over bearing, it comes at the right moments and isn genuinely funny.


What really stuck with me were how clean and crisp the visuals were, like holy shit everything was just so clean. This is movie is a visual feast that I believe is a must watch on a premium format.


All in all Ready Player One is an enjoyable visual feast of a thrillride, in which I think anyone can enjoy.

dwiimhn,"Visually it was great but there are some things I wasn’t crazy about...

- How is it after his aunt dies he doesn’t grieve AT ALL! He just walks away, gets kidnapped, then admits his love to Artemis/Samantha and his aunts death is never mentioned again. 

- There were some really weird close up shots on peoples faces for uncomfortably long periods of time, especially that guy who captures Wade and then just stares at the camera while he’s got a chokehold on him. 

- How come when he’s a hologram in Sorrento’s office he can put his hand through his arm? If he does that in real life his hand would be stopped by his arm. 

- When he’s in the truck, why wouldn’t he just take the haptic suit off to put in the key? Other people don’t need them in the real world and can get around just fine and it would’ve made it easier to get the key. 

- Mark Rylance as Halliday was perfect. It’s a different version than the character in the book but his version of a tech nerd giant longing for his care-free days was the best part of the movie. 

- The writing felt stale and predictable. Lots of moments where the exposition was as subtle as a brick to the face. 

- Between the story of finding the clues, the story of some kids escaping a corporation, and the love story, it didn’t work well together and parts were either forgettable, boring, or paced weirdly. 

- Visually it was so much fun but you’d start the movie with an awesome chase seen and then it was dull for a majority afterward. 

- I didn’t give one single shit about the characters as humans. Some may argue that’s the point but I should care about the characters in and out of the avatars similar to, well, “Avatar”. 

- They put a lot of focus on the redhead at IOI (another scene where they held the camera on a character for a weirdly long amount of time) when it didn’t really add up to anything except her figuring out the Adventure clue and... that’s it. 

- I may have missed some really obscure ones but there were less references than I expected. I was hoping to nudge my wife constantly pointing things out but it only happened a few times. 

I’m aware I’m nitpicking but I truly feel they spent their efforts and budget on the CGI and slacked on everything else. It seems Steve Spielberg phoned in his old adventure style and leaving the screenplay to Zack Penn and Ernest Cline was a terrible idea; just because Ernest can write a fun book doesn’t mean he’ll make an great script. 

EDIT: Originally said “arm through his hand” instead of “hand though his arm”

Parts of the 'gamer' aspects of the story though felt less a love-letter to gamer culture and more like an older writer had read a magazine article about gamers. There were throwaway references to clans and twitch and 'campers', but there were some missed oppertunities. I got a chuckle out of the ""80% of the screen advertisements before we induce seizures"", but it would have had so much more bite if IOI had wanted to parcel off the whole of the Oasis into paid 'DLC' which would divide the Oasis community, or if instead of Artemis' father having died in indentured servitude, like something out of a Dickens novel, he had gambled away everything addicted to IOI loot crates.

It s loud and fast and half the fun is just seeing if you can spot all the pop culture references that are on screen for 1.7 seconds and then never seen again.

5/10 (I have read the book)",87yv63
dwwl9nf,"First off let me say that I didn't read the book or even know it existed until recently (I'm sure that they changed a lot of things in the movie). 

I rated this film a 6. It wasn't bad, but it was only just barely good. I liked it in spite of itself - in spite of all the plot holes and missed opportunities, it still somehow managed to be fun in a generic sort of way. It's very CGI heavy (obviously) and Spielberg uses a moving camera a *lot* in this film, which kind of jumped out at me. The end result is that it does have a lot of energy and a lot of action. I liked the protagonist Wade too, and I liked some of the references in there (namely the RX-79 and Mechagodzilla, but jesus christ why didn't it have the beam rifle?? It could have ended the boss fight single handedly).

Anyway. The bad parts. This movie just felt so overwhelmingly conventional, which was a massive let down for me. I was increasingly hyped to see this movie, and I felt like this might be Spielberg's ""comeback"" in the sense that he was actually trying some challenging new material. I wanted it to have a lot to say about the MMO scene and the implications of VR tech like a good scifi movie should. But it feel completely short. Nothing revolutionary happens here; everything goes exactly as you would expect it to. 

In particular, the real faces behind the avatars were disappointing. At the beginning of the adventure, Wade's voice over (which was way too long during the exposition dump btw) states that people come to Oasis to be things they're not irl. So why is it that the obviously black orc is a black person, the ninja is an asian, the beautiful girl is a beautiful girl, etc. ? Everyone is exactly like their avatar in real life, which I think we all know is NEVER what happens lol. I almost died (not in a good way) when they showed the real Artemis finally, and her big ""disappointment"" was this birth mark on the side of her face. Yup. Wade is portrayed as being  so romantic for seeing past some slight skin discoloration, wow what a guy. Frankly, it would have been way better if Artemis was some fat gay dude or something and Wade finds this out in the third act, or maybe Wade ends up with H; that would be provocative, but instead the movie plays it safe. I'm sure some of this was staying true to the source material, but they changed stuff anyways so why not make some good changes?

a few other things really quickly:

-For real, Artemis's father died in that loyalty pod? He must have been a real idiot then, because that was sadly easy to escape.

-I did not get that H was a woman until my friend told me so after the movie ended.

-that ending was a badly rushed mess

-where were the police this whole time?? why are they just showing up now at the end?

-I am disappointed that we didn't get to see more of the dystopian world outside of the stacks.

-Halliday was definitely my favorite part of the movie, as well as the Silicon Valley guy's villain.

I could go on but I think that's good. Overall, the movie still had an infectious - something - that made me enjoy it somewhat. I guess it's just that Spielberg skill. But honestly I would say save your money and see something else unless you're really bored.",87yv63
dwma7xo,"I really don’t understand what the message was supposed to be. “Go out and get a life you fucking nerds”?  
He ends up closing the Oasis on Tuesdays and Thursdays because why, he got a girlfriend? He says he did it so that people would be forced to go outside and socialize. Meanwhile that fucking asshole met his girlfriend IN the Oasis, what kind of backwards logic is that? “Hey, ya’ll should go out to the real world more often, I mean, the real world is great. I know i’m saying that only now that i’m a billionaire and my real life is awesome, but seriously, i’m not a hypocrite”.
This movie feels like it was written by my dad, in a pitiful attempt to try to get me to play less games. All the while pandering to the people who probably don’t even play games.
I don’t get it, also, was Art3mis’s “burn” mark supposed to make her ugly or unattractive? Seriously, that girl was like a 7 or 8, and definitely a 10 for a guy like Wade. 
Speaking of Art3mis, she really came off as a self-serving gold digger, she literally only starts showing interest in Parzival the moment he finds the first key and is now worth thousands of dollars. From then on she’s like “yeah let’s team up! oh yeah of course I like you!! i’m not just using you and your knowledge to get rich myself!!!! oh, you WON the competition?!? hey let’s date!!!”

If this thing DOESN'T get a sequel, that'll be a surprise. 

Edit: And it's... kinda sad if you think about how even though the game world was saved... their real world is still overcrowded, polluted, corrupt, etc, and the good guys now deny everyone escape from that for a full 48 hours every week.

dwgo87m,"As a fan of the book I thought the movie was good but not great. They pretty much cut out half the book and character arcs. I get them needing to speed up the timeline a bit but there just wasn't the same payoff as in the book. I feel like they underutilized Sho and Daito. I really enjoyed them in the book and I really loved Sho's journey. I also think they all meet up a bit too soon and missing the emotional impact of them all seeing each other in the real world for the first time ( I won't say more for those who decide to read the book). 


Overall it was a fun action/adventure movie and if you haven't read the book you'll probably really enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie.

I'm sure people will point out the flaws with the characters and story but it's entertaining enough to look past most of its issues and just enjoy it for what it is.  Visually, it's pretty good and very enthralling.. I remember my eyeballs being glued to the screen everytime we ventured back into the OASIS.  A few things:



- It felt a little odd when Samantha just dumped all that ~~exposition~~ backstory on her dad so abruptly on Will only to never have that topic be revisited again in the film.

- Even though Sorrento was indeed a ""corporate asshole"", him killing the aunt by having her bombed in her own home felt a bit dark, even for his character.  


All that aside, that 'The Shining' scene was pretty good and where else are you gonna see a Gundam vs. Mecha-Godzilla battle on film?? The anime fan in me got a bit giddy when it appeared. That battle, although very short, was fucking rad.

My favorite parts of the book was the world building of the Oasis. The Oasis was their school, their exercise, their everything. I loved reading about them going to school then Parzival not having enough money to take transportation to another world where he thought the first key might be. 

I also liked the challenges much better in the book. The movie completely switched those up, and I see why they did, but the book makes the whole story feel much more like an actual adventure. There are months in between each challenge and it shows just how difficult Halladay's quest for the egg really was.

dwjpth7,"Alright, so I didn't know a whole lot about this before I went to see the movie. What I *had* heard, however, was that the book is pretty bad by most accounts and that the trailers made the movie look generic and uninspired. Since most reviews (from my country at least) gave Ready Player One a great score, I went to see the movie anyways hoping that it would have a good story and didn't rely solely on references and cheap tricks for nostalgia.

It was slightly better than expected, but unfortunately I had low expectations to begin with. I'd say the only redeeming sections of the movie were the race (which looked sweet in IMAX), the part with The Shining that was *kinda* cool and sometimes the visuals. The story, however, was not exactly good, but I honestly didn't really expect anything better than what we got. The romance made no sense and it looks like most would agree with me in that regard. Although the CGI mostly looked cool, the action was generally boring in a Transformers-way. If you're into the ""mindless explosions and animated things running into each other"" type of action, you'd probably like it, but it's not for me. In general, every beat of the movie was predictable as all hell, but I did enjoy the first act mostly due to the race. 

One thing murdered the originality of the movie, though. The references were fucking awful and detracted significantly from my enjoyment of the film. Incredibly, they made all those callbacks even more annoying than the trailers suggested and good god was it cringy. When the Iron Giant did the thumbs up thing, I rolled my eyes so hard I could lick my membrane with the tips of my eyeballs. I know this is based on a book and all, but if RPO was an original premise they could've easily ditched all the low-bar references and made a *much* better movie. I really wanted to be pleasantly surprised with a good movie. It genuinely was pretty fun to watch, but it doesn't warrant a second viewing.",87yv63

dwisv4b,"I feel like I'm a bit of an outlier from the comments I've read thus far, but I personally left the theater feeling a bit disappointed.  
  
I didn't expect the movie to completely follow the book (the trailer already established Wade meets Art3mis irl before the finale), but I felt it strayed too far for my liking. As someone mentioned before, the film was more of an adaptation of the source material. Crucial scenes were altered (e.g. how Parzival won the 1981 Quarter), timelines were shifted, character development was changed/cheapened (e.g. Og, Daito), etc.  
  
My friends who haven't read the book loved the film tho, so I'm definitely happy about that. And I can't deny it was entertaining. But all-in-all, even with managed expectations, the noticeable departure from the source material really sunk the film for me. ",87yv63

dwjxsl1,"I don't think I've ever known a film to shift from genuinely phenomenal to unbearably cringe-worthy so quickly, and so often.

Scenes like The Shining sequence, the final battle, the extra life reveal, the first race, the CGI, the initial world-building and Sir Mark Rylance's performance are all absolutely brilliant. Really great watches and put a metaphorical smile on my face.

At other times, I was physically recoiling from the excruciating dialogue, the contrived love angle and (yes I know) the forced references. I know that is exactly what the film is all about, I went in knowing that and expected to like it but The Iron Giant giving the T2 thumbs up, I rolled my eyes. I know I should I enjoy that, I know it's nothing more than what it is, but I just can't help it. Maybe it was because of the very contrived dystopia-element of the film. As someone who is bored to tears with them (big company) vs us (little guy) dystopia this one really felt by the numbers and very unexplained. In fact there are a number of very unexplained parts of this film, Art3mis' backstory (who was her henchman guy?), her and Wade's relationship, IOI in general. It just seemed like it was ignoring a lot the previously mentioned stuff and distracting the viewer with HEY LOOK HERE'S A THING FROM THAT SHOW/GAME/FILM YOU LIKE.

I don't know, it's a film that teeters on being really great and then being truly unbearable. It has conflicted me. I went into this almost completely blind. I knew it would chocfull of pop culture references and contained a VR world but that's as far as I knew. I need to really sit on this one. Maybe I'll read the book...",87yv63
dwgzdoj,"Went to see this on opening day in Australia, and the theatre was completely empty. In retrospect that was probably for the best because I was genuinely cacking my pants laughing for the majority of the film...

1) Tye Sheridan playing the protagonist doesn’t do the film any favours. As someone who went in blind, he was completely bland and probably the least magnetic lead Spielberg’s ever had one in one of his films.
2) The poor dialogue and weak characters leave zero impact after the credits roll. I would have been happy to spend the whole film with just Art3mis and Aech, as both of the actresses playing them at least seemed like they were having fun with the material. So many capable actors wasted on weak and padded material.
3) The best they could do to make Olivia Cooke not look beautiful was put a red splotch over her right eye? Get out. The “reveal” of her IRL appearance was fucking hilarious.
4) The camerawork within the Oasis was so unbelievably mechanical - I’ve seen video games for the PS3 with more natural looking camerawork in their cutscenes. Only a handful of the scenes within the Oasis actually seemed tangible - it was also always so painfully obvious that the world around the characters in every scene was chock-full of green screens. Disappointed that Spielberg only seemed to use practical sets for the interior of IOI’s HQ and bits of the slums. 
5) Credit where credit’s due, the VFX artists who worked on the Shining sequence deserve an award. That scene was easily my favourite in the film, but in a better version of the film, the naked woman encounter could have easily had a bigger impact on Aech/Helen’s character arc, or at least added some stakes to the damn film. The only characters that died were dicks anyway.

With all the shoehorned product placement, out of place 80s rock songs, characters from other IPs, and the quote-un-quote romance between Tired Sheridan and Olivia “How Was I Paid Less Than This Guy For This Movie” Cooke, I’m just disappointed that one of the best filmmakers of all time couldn’t bring anything to the premise.

8/10

One of my complaints is the whole leap of faith thing at the end. I never felt like it was a struggle for Wade to get to the point of actually taking the leap and kissing Artemis. In his very first real-life meeting with Artemis, he already hits it off with her extremely well. He didn't seem nervous or shy at all, he was confident enough to go up to her and touch her hair, and they literally almost kissed within the very first minutes (which was only interrupted because she figured out a clue). I know they had already spent some time in the virtual world, but meeting someone in real life is different. The whole thing with Halliday is that he never felt comfortable in the real world. So, I would've made Wade similar to that in the sense that he's really shy and awkward in real life. But through the adventure he goes on with Artemis in the real world, he would start to really connect with her. The leap at the end would feel much more like an actual leap because of how shy and awkward we would've seen him previously being (just like Halliday was). ",87yv63
dwo0oyw,"Sadly ""Meh"" would be the way to summarize the movie . The book was one of my first audiobook experiences and I fully enjoyed it as I am an nerd/gamer and for what the book was, full of 80's pop references in a massively virtual online environment. 

The movie had to have restriction I get that as you cannot put the entire book into it, but many of the events things shown there had no backstory, context. 

[Just one example: when IOI found the third key they they just said it found it, no more context](#spoiler)

Actor wise: they were all pretty forgetable. Sure mostly because they had CGI avatars but even when in real life there was no chemistry or charisma. 

I like Hannah John-Kamen from Killjoys as Dutch but in other roles she is still so forgettable, emotionless. Mendelsohn and others also suffered from the fact there was not enough time to give them a proper backstory and to make them believable. 

The movie sadly felt like ""a mile wide and an inch deep"" especially when you have read the book. 

It was a 6/10 for me and I am being generous. I liked the CGI + I almost teared up for some part I already forgot near the ending so it did hit some soft spots I did not know I had). But in summary I expected a lot more from Spielberg. 

3/10 from my missus who promised to be more careful in reviewing movies I offer to take her to look. I sold it as an IMAX experience and the CGI was fun, especially until the first key.

The book showed the OASIS as less a game and more how the entire world does everything - school, shopping, business, etc.

dwm3405,"Wow, everyone here seem to have loved the movie. Can I offer a counterpoint and say: I thought the movie sucked, big time?

It is a very confused film. It doesn't know whether it is a fun action movie that is a blast to watch, or a more serious film that offers life lessons & social critique. It doesn't even know whether it is a film for adults or a kids movie - it has enough 80s pop-culture references to be a Gen-X movie, and enough juvenile humour to be a kids one.

Another director might have meshed all of the above into a more coherent product, but Spielberg fails at this. The beginning race sequences are undeniably great, and [the deaths of Wade's aunt and her boyfriend](#spoiler) are suitably dark. But that's it. Most of the CGI videogame battles aren't well choreographed, and lessons about valuing your real life and staving off corporate greed are executed very badly. The game world of Oasis feels lacking in content even compared to our own present-day MMOs, and their real, dystopian world feels about the same.

In the second half of the movie, the mawkishness grew so strong that I felt my face burning & actually considered leaving the cinema.

I really would not give this movie more than 6/10. I might even give it 5/10 for advertising itself as a gamer's movie, but instead focusing almost entirely on 80s pop culture references. Yeah, I'm sure in AD 2045, people will still be obsessed with Atari and Back to the Future.

dwm5ghj,"I am really surprised this movie is getting so much love. Putting the differences from the book aside, the movie just made no sense right from the beginning. They've been running this same race so long that people have given up on a trillion dollars, but Art3mis has NEVER shown up and tried it before? People playing VR headsets in the street and not getting run over? The main character is drugged, wakes up, walks up some stairs and ""Wow, it's soooo slow here! Amazing!""

Shit just happens with no reactions from the characters. Shoto and Aech die in game and the main characters don't even react, literally don't even say a word. The love story was atrociously rushed. The whole ""rebellion"" story line is never explained or expanded upon. The third clue is found OFF SCREEN. I could go on and on. It was just a bad movie imo

Also, the Shining scene seems to be a favorite but it just felt like I was on a Disney Land ride. There's no challenge or test, it was just Aech stumbling through random callbacks to the movie before falling through a magic door. It was a glorified montage with no point or fullfillment to the story until they randomly find the key with floating zombies.",87yv63

I did read the book and though I liked the book for the adventure, I expected a lot of change in order to transfer well to screen. That said, the character development (or lack thereof) somehow felt so rushed even though the movie has a whopping 2 hours 18 minutes runtime. I wish they would have had Z fawning over Artemis while watching her twitch or something, anything that indicated he was a massive fanboy before their actual meeting. Also, the challenges just seemed easy. I know it may be hard to convey the relative difficulty on screen, but there were hardly any banging their heads against a wall moments to really show us just how painstaking it was to get a key.  Other gripes are: Basically no Ludus, iRok and the other girl henchman character were more annoying than necessary, and we never get to see Z's struggles of being truly poor in game and being an absolute nobody.

The visuals were amazing and pacing itself felt very nice even for a long movie. Unfortunately, my other points made this not very memorable for me, and I will likely never watch it again unfortunately.",87yv63

dwm1suv,"Ready Player One is a blast to watch. Characters are a little shallow and the relationship between the guy and the girl was rushed, but the whole thing is a lot of fun. Spielberg knows how to direct action and there's certainly a lot of it.

If you've played any number of video games for a decent amount of time over the last 30-40 years, this is a must watch. If you want to count movies not based on video games, but are video game-esk, RPO is the best one out there. Better than Avatar for certain, which has no video game aspects to it, but there are some definite influences in it.

Might have to watch it a couple times to see if you catch all of the Easter eggs and references sprinkled throughout. Definitely worth watching in 3D and IMAX. The bigger the screen the better.

If you're concerned about how much the trailers showed, most of what you see in the trailers was within the first 30-45 minutes of the film, so nothing spoiled. The Iron Giant is the only obvious thing but you see him early in the film and even if you didn't see the trailers, you'd know there's no way he didn't make an appearance later on.

Neither Rush's song ""Tom Sawyer"" nor the ""Pure Imagination"" remake were in the film, despite being big parts of the trailers. I was a bit disappointed. There was even a great spot for ""Tom Sawyer"" to pop up, too.  If you saw, I bet you could get where it would be perfect.  It's towards the end.

The competition, the whole crux of the story was just way too easy. I’m not saying the book was perfect. Wade is Mary Sue as hell, but at least there was opportunities for the reader to try to figure out what was going on along with the characters. 

None of the keys/clues in the book are the same as the movie. They’re all different, flatter, and conveyed a significantly less feeling of satisfaction as they were achieved. 

In fact, the movie is completely different from the book. Outside of a few different tent pole scenes, the only thing the two have in common are Oasis itself, the names of the characters with some of their characteristics, and that there is an Easter Egg hunt with three keys. 

The clues are different, the keys are different, the gates aren’t a thing, there’s no real felt tension of IOI crawling up the leaderboard, character motivations are different, Art3mis leads a gang of freedom fighters... kind of, which is immediately plotted out of significance, all of the relationships, especially Wade and Aech’s friendship and the romance with Art3 feel thin as paper, the Gunter culture is... non-existent? And everyone feels like they’re tripping and falling through the clues to advance the plot because it’s a movie and it has to. And don’t even get me started on how frustratingly quickly everyone met up IRL or how contrived the Halliday and Kira relationship was taffy-pulled and infused all over the story. 

The pacing. Ugh, the pacing. 

Some may like that it’s completely different from the source material. I didn’t expect it to be identical, and I was wondering how they could even fit the story into a single movie and do it justice, and I guess I know now. They couldn’t, so they didn’t even try.  Ready Player One isn’t a great book, but it’s certainly a guilty pleasure, and I was thoroughly disappointed.

dx1axls,"**This is my unstructured argument for why this post modern film is one of the worst I've seen in recent times. Bear with me.**

To start off, I would like to say that the film is a complete reference bait of a cinematic product. The team simply decided to spam as many pop culture references into it as possible. As Barry Hertz put it, “it is less a film and more an overstuffed cultural recycling bin.” They are also completely incoherent and provide nothing to the film, other than eye candy. Adding  a menace of contemporary references did not help. Most forty year olds who come to the film for Joy Division, The Breakfast Club, The Shining, Atari, NES, Pac-Man, etc. have no idea who Tracer from Overwatch, Sans from Undertale, or Master Chief from Halo is. The children who then comes for the latter, have no idea what the former are, making it a movie with a very confused target audience. Wasn't The Iron Giant a film against violence? Why is the robot now acting like Liberty Prime from the Fallout series?

Like the book, the film's screenplay is as bad as it gets. The dialog is not only very cheesy at times, but not like anything an actual human being would ever utter. Pair that with a rushed cliché love story which seems more like a misogynistic trophy hunt than anything else, and you have got a pretty bad start already. The main character also acts completely braindead at times, while all the somewhat interesting characters do all the work. The villain, by the way, acts nothing like a villain would, he poses no threat, and all his “Halliday historians” rejoice when Parzival wins, when they in reality should mourn their unemployment.

Another thing would be when Anorek tests Parzival with a contract which he refuses to sign, only to be completely on board with seemingly the same one, five minutes later.

To add to all this, the story really does not make any sense and has no real world consequences. Why on earth does no one bat an eye when a large corporation resorts to domestic terrorism to win a game, but when a single man is in possesion of a weapon, five police vehicles show up to arrest him. In the same scene a girl with an anarchist sign gladly cooperates with the police.

That they had the brilliant idea of changing most of the plot from the book was probably for the best, however they somehow made it alot worse. Consider the first easter egg for example. Isn't going backwards, the first thing people try in a racing game?

Pacing is another issue with this film. In the book, Parzival plans for multiple months how to stop Sorrento and the Sixers from winning, while the film finishes it in what seems like three days.
And why does all the best egg hunters conveniently live in the same city? The book did at least have them live in different countries, which would make more sense both statistically and plot wise.
The ending's extra life scene is a huge deus ex machina, by the way, and the way they try to tell the children to not use the internet so much is ridiculous. Like anyone actually changed their minds after that.

Overall a terrible, terrible film with a way too high animation/CGI budget (those animators truly need some praise for their hard work). **Sorry for my ranting. :-)**",87yv63
dwh1k87,"I was next level stoked for this movie. Paid $27.75 to see it in Imax 3D. I read the book... the day it came out. I have a autographed copy in a place on honor on my bookshelf. I’ve been shilling Ready Player One since day one to all of my geeky friends for the last few years despite the book’s flaws. I just loved it.

I absolutely loathed this movie with a fury I can’t even begin to explain. I mean yes the movie looked cool, had fun references, a good soundtrack and all that jazz, but what about everything else?!?

It completely misses spirit of the underlying draw of the book. It isn’t just the pop culture references. The, “Oh hey, I’ve played that game!”/“I’ve seen that movie!”/“I know that song!” That isn’t the appeal of Ready Player one.

It’s the idea that the key to finding Halliday’s Easter Egg is god-tier knowlege of general geekery (particularly that of the 1980s). It’s about using that knowlege to answer the riddles and beat the puzzles so that you can be filithy rich, famous, and get admin powers in greatest video game ever created.

In Spielberg’s Ready Player One however, they key to winning every geeks wet dream is stumbling upon the answers to the riddles (and/or puzzles) and having an encyclopedic knowledge of Halliday THE MAN, instead of having an obsessive knowlege of the geek culture that Halliday himself was obsessed with. 

Now I know a book fan being mad about the movie may seem par for the course, but this isn’t the typical “oh why aren’t Harry Potter’s eyes green?”/ “The Fight Club book had a different ending.”/“They Killed Selmy on the show, but he’s still alive in the books!” kind of thing. 

The movie has a DIFFERENT STORY THAN THE BOOK. It doesn’t have changes. It was a loose adaption at best. They took the concept, settings, and characters and then wrote a nearly original story.

It still has remnants of the book’s plot (and whole scenes moved to different parts of the story), but overall I almost feel like there isn’t even a point in comparing the two because they are so insanely different (and yes I know the author co-wrote the screenplay). I wouldn’t be so mad if the story they chose to write instead was better. Not even better than the book’s story, just better than what we got.

The new plot relied too much on luck, convenience, being intentionally vague on the passage of time, and ignoring what the movie just told us/it’s own world-building. ~~I really wanted to give examples to show I’m not talking out of my ass. But I don’t comment on reddit much, at least on subs that use spoiler tags, and couldn’t get them to work for the life of me. But if you ask, I’ve already got them typed up, lol.~~

Gunters and Aech:
[Aech is a world class Gunter, one of the best of the best. Best friend of Wade and he’s never seen The Shining, even though the the the movie just told us that it’s Halliday’s #11 favorite horror movie. The excuse given is Aech doesn’t like scary movies, but it’s unbelievable that ANY Gunter, let alone Aech of all people, would never have watched The Shinning. I really enjoyed that scene. It was funny and one of the best scenes in the movie. But it doesn’t make any sense. You’re telling me Aech never even went to Wiki or the archives and just read the plot? Didn’t gleam it from pop culture osmosis? Just... Nothing.](#spoiler)

Fame and Art3mis: 
[After finding the Copper Key, Wade goes to the Archives to do his usual Gunter-ing, but gets attacked by a mob demanding selfies. Art3mis gets him out of that situation, takes off her disguise, and tells him that now that he is famous he needs to hide who he is to go to places like that without getting swarmed. She gives him a disguise and then proceeds to walk out right next to him in her normal avatar, through the Gunter infested archives. This is ridiculous because 1) she herself is #2 on the leaderboard and thus is just as famous as Wade. 2) She was already famous before that, which is why she had those Clark Kent glasses in the first place to let Wade use them. Wade recognizes her when she has a motorcycle helment on from basically just her lips and chin on a racetrack and yet a room full of Gunters and NO ONE RECOGNIZES HER.](#spoiler)

From being incredibly fast paced with no scenes to slow down and build the world or characters, so many scenes that made 0 sense (People playing VR in the street, at the end when Sorrento walks through the crowd like some sort of hero scene and not one person stopped him, no one explored the race track and walked backwards?), and character changes like Art3mis being an attractive, thin girl who has a minor birth mark over one eye. 

Then you had story problems where things would have been confusing or not have made sense if you hadn't read the book, and things coming out of nowhere to save the day (like the Gundam at the end? Oh by the way it's going to expire in 30 seconds... why?). Not to mention it was even more obvious than the book that it was pandering to modern-day pop culture, yet is set in 2045. ",87yv63
dx0r0dz,"I did not like this movie at all, 

If one were to remove the easter eggs of pop culture away from the movie, it fails as a movie. The main character being the weak and wimpy kid becomes redeemed at the end of the movie without having anything significant happen to his character - [Not to state that his aunt dying wasn't significant, we do not see him develop as a character through the course of the movie.](#spoiler)

I did not appreciate the way the handled the idea of online relationships and friendships, reality is not all that its made up to be, a person who built a state of the art vrmmorpg would know that I felt that it was a cop-out. 

We are to understand that whole world just sits back and allows IOI to do whatever it wants to do and that no media organization or government will bring them to question. I mean, artemis talks about her father dying in one of those boxes, nobody will look into that? Is the director asking to imagine that the future is going to be a dystopia? 

I find it hard to believe that a corporation that was willing to blow up hundreds of people just to get rid of the lead character wouldn't blow up the little van that the lead characters were in, I mean, how strong is their plot armor. 

I couldn't get over the fact that the producers of this movie were trying to milk my money simply by just throwing things I have loved.

-I really dont get how people interact with this VR world. It's all digital, so who the hell needs to go through all of this crap to win the contest when you can just hack the system or use ""cheats""? Hell just steal the IP like the Chinese and make your own VR system.

And how do you get caught in a surprise gunfight, and then have to duck and ""hide""? Just turn the damn thing off.

And why does a lot of 2040 look like 2003?

dwi8b1k,"As someone who’s heard of the book for years but never knew anything about it, I can’t help but say I’m a little underwhelmed. Usually that happens when I’ve read the book first, but with this movie I had zero expectation and still felt let down. 

I’m sure I’ll be flamed relentlessly for it, but at least here’s why:

- The love story between Wade and Samantha moved waaaay too fast. On only the second or third time they meet he’s already telling her he loves her and all of a sudden they’re Romeo and Juliet. In their first real-world interaction he starts caressing her face and I couldn’t help but cringe. Their bond was going great up until that point it felt so rushed. Could have used more banter and flirting before getting close

- After 5 years of no one finding the first key you would think it was a pretty big deal after he won the race. The only time we see the world’s reaction is at the archives, and even then, it’s cut short by Goro/Sam. I would have liked to feel the emotion and glory of the find, like showing people cheering from around the world, or being in awe in the middle of the street. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or even Katniss after the first Games for crying out loud did a better job at displaying the public’s reactions of their achievement. I mean, that’s what make the adventure so great right? That everyone is eyeing the same prize? Literally blue balled the audience IMO

- The ‘war’ at the end was epic, but the build up of  rallying the entire Oasis happened in literally like 10 seconds. Had they followed the public’s reaction throughout Paricival’s adventure and at least somewhat displayed the emotional/spiritual/social connection everyone had to the Oasis (outside of narration) it would have been much more emotional and impactful. It’s like he called in a COD killstreak and all of sudden people just showed up. Just felt fake

- Lastly, the High 5 had zero chemistry in real life.  Not sure if that was intended, but instead of a reunion or grand meet-up it felt like an awkward first date. The funniest part was the 11-year old kid, but Aech and Samurai Guy (sorry forgot his name) couldn’t pull it off for me. The Rat Pack felt more like the Flat Pack

As a popcorn flick I would say it was very entertaining and I highly recommended spending the extra cash for 3-D or even 4-D/D-Box. As an epic Spielberg cyber adventure, I would say it missed the mark by quite a few notches.

I was very happy to see a big blockbuster directed by him again, it was refreshing seeing someone that knows what he's doing.

All of the scenes flew great. The futuristic real world was shot in a way where it felt real and not a heavily CGI set, with the various camera movements and blocking. It was a delight. As were the action scenes in the Oasis world. So satisfaying seeing action well shot.

dwhxuln,"I had incredibly low expectations for this movie, but ended up having an absolute blast. If you are a fan of the book, keep in mind the movie changes things drastically, many of which I consider for the best, outside of the changes concerning obtaining the bronze key. The book was a mystery novel with some action, where the the movie is an action flick with no real mystery. Visually, it's amazing, but you have to make some concession in terms of pacing and jumps in logic.

If nothing else, the movie did a much better job with Art3mis, who no longer feels like a prize for Wade, but rather actually does stuff. More to the point, they do away with the disgusting invasion of privacy scene we get from the book.

i will note, i hated the first act and cringed through a lot of it. The first third felt like an exercise in form over substance: while beautiful, the lines were poor and the acting meh. Also, while all the challenges are changed, i appreciated Halliday's room having posters of all the omitted ones.

That beginning race scene was spectacular, with all that action blending together on the screen. I found it really interesting that there was no music in that scene, just showing pure action. It was really entertaining to watch.

Even though I’ve never seen The Shining (I guess you could say I’m like Aech), as soon as they entered the hotel, I got a big smile on my face. It actually surprised me. It looked like they were in the film itself. That was just overall a great scene imo.

I also liked how all the challenges were changed/altered. The first two challenges are completely different from the original. And while some people here didn’t like that, I loved it. It made it feel less of a “visualization” and more of an actual movie.

The film is not perfect though. While I thought the film did a good job of shortening the story for the screen, there were some moments, such as the “I love you” moment in the club, that felt more rushed than they did in the book. It felt like it was less than a week after they had met.

But overall, I thought it was a solid movie, and I’ll definitely watch it again. 8/10",87yv63

If they had replaced some of the slower parts with some time in the real world, it would have made the film much more immersive. We would have gotten a better understanding of why people loved the OASIS so much, and why it was so critical to defend it.

Also, the villains didn't seem evil enough. Yeah they kill people and have indentured servants, but all the characters act like the fate of the world was at stake. It really felt like the movie didn't want to be too dark, and as a result we have villains that are bad for sure, but not outright evil.

* Some things in the movie aren't explained in the movie like they are in the book.  What does the IOI abbreviation stand for and why's it everywhere?  Why is Art3mis getting nailed by IOI for ""debt"" she incurred? Who are the ""High Five?"".  Art3mis welcomes Wade to the ""rebellion"" the first time she meets him, and it's never really mentioned again.
* Ogden Morrow has a bigger part in the book and I feel they kind of crapped on that.


Sure there are a lot of things in the book that would be a nightmare to bring to an entertaining action film (watching Wade playing Joust with a lich for the first key?  Yawn), as well as the minefield of rights they'd have to purchase for all of the references in the book. So the film was pretty entertaining with what they put together.",87yv63

dwlwxt5,"I'll start by saying that I was not a fan of the book at all, but always thought the book had potential to be something better than it was. So when I heard this movie was more inspired than an outright adaptation of the book I gave it a shot.

I ended up not liking the movie either for different reasons. It definitely does a better job of streamlining the story but it loses probably the only good part of the book and that is the state of the world and why things are the way they are.

Don't get me wrong, the movie does touch the subject a bit but it's almost afraid of going there so it never gets brought up back again. It doesn't really drive the message on why people have to turn to the Oasis for their RL needs and sometimes end up in the work camps.

Other things are just problems with pacing and dialogue. Seriously, some of the dialogue sounds like those bad EA conferences at E3 where they have ""gamers"" try out a game and talk to each other in the most cringy ways possible. 

As for the references, Roger Rabbit and Wreck-It Ralph did them better. They just did them in a way that felt more natural than ROP did. If you weren't Tracer or owned by Warner Bros then it was really blink or you miss. No one is saying that they should've held the shot for 5 minutes but again, Roger and Ralph did them better where you could enjoy them more. The final battle also suffered since it didn't have a lot of other IPs that made it more epic.

Now for the things I enjoyed. One was the RX-78-7 in action (psst Hollywood, this is one anime that would actually work in live action). And the first part of the Shining scene. That was fucking awesome.

dwh0vy9,"These are my thoughts on the movie as someone who is a big fan of the book and thinks that movie adaptations are usually not as good as the source material.  

First, things I liked:  

 * I really enjoyed I-Rok's character in the movie and I think they did a better job in the movie than in the book.  He was funny in an immature-yet-not-completely-childish way and used his knowledge and skills about the Oasis to work with IOI, instead of being some jerkass kid that went to Parzival's school.  
 * Nolan Sorrento was cast spot on, and for the most part played his role very well.  [The infiltration of his office and IOI HQ was cool, though different from the book, as it was more of a team rescue mission than a solo pre-mediated sabotage](#spoiler)
 * Though I haven't seen The Shining, I thought that scene was pretty cool and well done.  
 * [Ogden Morrow's role as the curator was a nice touch that tied his role of helping the High Five in the book with the movie's addition of the Halliday Journal](#spoiler)


Things I didn't like:

 * The movie was way too rushed and didn't give me a chance to get invested in the characters or in the scale of the competition and the magnitude of the Oasis.  In the books, the battles at each Key and Gate location were epic scale, with Sixers hot on the heels of the High Five and gunter clans right behind them.  Except for the final battle, there weren't many other scenes that showed the amount of non-Sixer players that well.  The character reveal halfway through the movie was way too fast.  In the book it marks the end of the second arc and beginning of the 3rd arc and is a surprise after a large amount of buildup.  Also in the movie the scale in the real world was too small.  Oh what a coincidence that everyone was in Columbus and just happened to be picked up by Aech.  
 * ""Welcome to the Resistance"".  And a million voices groaned, and were suddenly silenced.  Come on, shoehorning a teenage dystopian resistance into this movie was so out of place.  There's absolutely no mention of anything like that in the book and it's not pursued hardly at all for the rest of the film.  Fuckin rooftop garden in an abandoned warehouse shenanigans, gimme a break.  Of course its led by a teenage girl with unique traits.  
 * The magnitude of the egg hunt was underplayed in the film.  The clue for the first key was pretty fucking obvious when you see that clip; someone would've found it a lot faster.  Also, no one the audience cared about actually died or anything, so IOI's activities weren't as nefarious as in the book.  
 * The characters didn't change at all, since in the movie the whole thing took place over a week whereas in the book it took several months.  Parzival started off dirt fucking poor in the book and it wasn't until he did the climb to 99 with Art3mis that he actually became as powerful as the movie shows.  
 * The product placement.  That Minecraft logo and the Overwatch characters thrown in, I did not appreciate.  The movie is supposed to be nostalgic about the 80s, not the 2010s.  Felt too much like the studio is trying to connect with today's kids.

dwifnhk,"I was pretty let down by this. Yes, a lot of movies based on books suffer from the whole ""Oh the book was better thing"". In this case, however, it's not just that. I knew going into it that the movie would ""dumb down"" the quest and clues, but I think that the movie kind of forgot it's premise. 

In the movie, like in the book, IOI has a whole team that are experts on 80's trivia and nerd-dom. This makes sense because in the book the quest is based on mastery of relatively obscure 80's trivia and nerd-dom. Halliday used the quest to get everybody into all the cool nerdy stuff he was into. In the movie, however, it's not really clear how it's relevant. The first portal was ""stumbled across"", but the answer was based on a random moment in Halliday's life where he ""wished he could go backwards"". The second clue was a reference to a date with a girl he really loved but blew it because he was awkward. The movie kind of glosses over the 3rd clue (IOI just seemed to figure it out and block off his castle). The only real ""trivia"" required was the knowledge that 'Adventure' had the first Easter Egg.

So the quest itself was really a no-nostalgia-necessary endeavor in the movie. It required a person to have a really creepy knowledge about the man himself based on random security camera footage. The nostalgia and obscure nerdy references drove the plot of the book. Be honest, in the movie they were essentially just visuals in the background. 

Again, I understand that the movie couldn't have the obscure references that drove the plot of the book - there simply wouldn't be a clean way to translate that to film, but instead of tweaking the clues and challenges to be a little more ""accessible"" to a wide viewing audience they just kinda abandoned the idea of having obscure 80's trivia matter at all.

That's the whole reason all the retro 80's visuals are supposed to be there in the first place even though it's 60 years later! Everybody obsessed over the contest and devoured the most obscure aspects of 80's pop culture to be able to compete. That's the whole reason a team at IOI is trained in 80's nerd culture. If the quest doesn't really have anything to do with knowing that information, then you get this weird movie that gets to load up with a bunch of nostalgic cgi without actually having to justify it in the plot.",87yv63

dwsxmsc,"I saw it last night. It was a lot of fun, but it was way too long. There were some odd plot threads that didn't really go anywhere. Like I thought they were setting up an arc for Cooke's character with her birth mark, but when it was just a throwaway scene to try to show chemistry it kind of hurt the overall film. The end result was that the real world protagonists had less chemistry than their CGI avatars. 

Also, we're supposed to believe that the whole world is in a state of disarray, but when we leave the stacks it just looks like any other urban skyline. We run through the streets and there isn't any litter or homeless people. Then despite ignoring a corporate terrorist attack, the police arrive just in time to break up an angry mob. The film has a lot of contrivances and conveniences, especially toward the end. I also felt like the aunt and boyfriend subplot was just filler. It would've been better if Wade lived alone, but there was something else in the trailer, like some piece of hardware, that ultimately gets destroyed. This would've added more tension than killing two characters nobody liked anyway. Cutting the fat would've made this movie a lot better.

This is one of those films that undeniably a fun theater-going experience. I thought the world-building was really strong. I generally hate overuse of animation, but I have to admit the Oasis was a lot of fun. It was better than any of the live action stuff. It's got your typical Spielberg cheese sometimes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Movies don't always have to take place in reality. This film tapped into something that reminded me of being a teenager that spent too much time playing video games. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a good time with this film. 

**7/10**

It's far from a perfect film. The romance could've used more chemistry in the live action scenes, the script could've been a lot tighter, and there's a fair bit of filler in the first half they could've cut entirely. But this was a blockbuster that is a fair bit better than the average fair the past few years. I'll definitely give it another watch before it leaves screens. ",87yv63

dx979bc,"I have not read the book. The biggest annoyance for me of the movie is the lame way it saddled up a revolution and then took it nowhere. This movie actually had an opportunity to say something meaningful about the shitty situation our world is in. These kids took over a mega tech corporation, snatching it from the hands of the super rich with the help of an enlightened working class. And the best they could do with that is business as usual with a little time off for sex.

dwh4jyh,"Movie was a huge disappointment. I wish I could say ""Maybe if I didn't read the book I would've liked it"" but no. No I can't say that cuz if I didn't read the book and just went in knowing nothing I wouldn't care or know about anything going on. Not a fan. To each their own.",87yv63
dwhwckz,"Just saw the movie and I thought that is above average at most. The movie's target audience was obviously those born in the late 70s to the early 90s, who grew up with the nostalgic era of movies and video games. Though I felt the acting, writing, and the direction of the movie is more suited for those who are about to hit their teenage years. 

The movie is full of cheesy and cringy scenes that really shouldn't be in movies anymore. People watching this are in their late 20s to their early 40s but the movie is about a good looking, muscular neckbeard and a girl who doesn't exist in the real world. I really felt like the movie underestimated the fandom of the video game culture, whom are famous for having high expectations and sensibility; when it comes to this they know their stuff.

I felt that they should have cut in half the real world aspect replaced it with more of the Oasis, because it is the highlight of the film.

The best part for me was the OG RX-78-2 Gundam vs. MechaGodzilla battle, though I felt the CGI was really dark (I understand they were in Plant Doom) but it was difficult to see through the shadows. They could've lengthen this scene and added more Anime aspects with the Gundam.  

There was a lot of plot holes that irked me throughout the movie, if anyone could explain please let me know:    

* No one ever tried to do any QA in the race ever? Just to fuck around?  
 
* The main character meets a ""girl"" in VR for 2hrs and is suddenly in love? Also tells her his name as well..kinda wished that Artemis looked like the World of Warcraft guy in Southpark. Would you still love ""her""?  

* How did Artemis find Wade?  Did she do the same thing Erlic did? How did Erlic know he bought the suit? Should be more than 1 Wade buying the suit..really not an uncommon name.  

* Your Aunt dies and the first thing you do is flirt with a girl..ok. You didn't cry, she took care of you when your parents died. Kinda like if Aunt May just died and Peter Parker just tried to do some sexy times with MJ.  
  
* I thought the IOI where the police, but they are a game company that has a SWAT team as well? The police shows up at the end but doesn't really do anything beforehand.  

* What did Wade win the end there? An Egg? Money? Control over the Oasis? Also why would shutting it down during Tuesday and Thursday help? People play to escape, now all they have to do is look at the shanytown around them.  

* Kinda weird no one used the Oasis for dirty things (though it was mentioned).  

* How did IOI find the Third clue before anyone in Hi-5 did?

Overall I'd give this film a 6 out of 10, I think Spielberg was trying to create a cult classic using cult classics but it just didn't work out.

dwhgy5b,I guess I’m in the minority’s but I thought it was really bad. It had some fun action scenes but the writing was atrocious and the humor almost always fell flat for me. And the level of cheese in the last 10 minutes was just ridiculous. ,87yv63
dwmkr0o,"I... hated it. And to be fair I had one of the worst movie-going experiences of my life.

We entered the busy lobby to a bunch of stank-faces because... well... it stank. REEKED. Literally smelled of farts. My bf went to the bathroom after the movie and told me there was water all over the floor, so I'm assuming there was some pipe shit (pun intended) going down.

The theater was HOT. Like muggy.

This group of women sat right in front of us and apparently weren't really there to watch a movie? They just sat talking about how and when they were going to see Acrimony.

I ended up getting food poisoning. (it was a movie grill) Must have been all the fecal matter in the air.

Now to get to the actual movie:

* sub-par dialogue, for sure
*  they made IOI way too docile, imo
* I think they needed more time in meat-space so we could connect with the characters
*  They did a *terrible* job with H's voice. My bf couldn't understand him AT ALL

All in all, it was too fast-paced and scattered. The best part was [*The Shining* sequence, especially later when they flash to the 6-ers in IOI going through it.](#spoiler)

dwi03gk,"Just returned from cinema.... Here's my stream of consciousness.

Visually brilliant but was absolutely gutted that the challenges were changed from hard to win/needing extreme nerd knowledge to watery rubbish. A race as the first challenge?! No. And the last key location is just ""found"" they don't even explain how. 
Far too much focus on romantic crap (halliday/kira parzival/artemis). It's not a rom com.
I can understand making it general pop culture rather than niche 80s but none of the characters seemed to have done any research. Aech hadn't seen the shining?! Are you kidding me?!
Also one of my favourite themes in the book is how the high five want to work the problems independently and don't accept or want help from each other, they want to win by their own merits but also want their friends to succeed by their own merits. In the moving despite repeatedly saying ""I don't clan"" they immediately share all the information they have. Utter facepalm from me.
Very disappointed in Castle Anorak visually and never seeing Og's avatar was sad. 

And don't get me started on the ending....",87yv63
dwiip1g,"Am I the only one that was extremely disappointed with the movie adaptation? Like I understand if you never read the book, but the movie didn’t even follow the basic plot lines of the book. Obviously changes have to be made when converging a book to a movie, but you should never have to change anything more than details; the basic plot should stay the same. There’s 3 keys (with challenges to get them) that open 3 gates (with challenges to beat them). Instead, I was met with ONLY 3 keys, no gates, and very underwhelming challenges at each. If all you had to do was drive backwards, do you really think it would have taken 5 years for anyone to figure it out? The location of the first key was much more complicated. I was just extremely underwhelmed and the entire thing seemed like it was just filled with references like halo and such that should have never been there (different timeline and mostly of the gunters would have been more 80’s related most likely) simply to draw in audiences. I obsessed over this book and anxiously waited 2 years for the movie and I was so disappointed I almost regret that a movie even exists. It just lacks what the book possesses.",87yv63
dwixqtt,"I didn't hate it but it tested my patience. Too many moments of ""hey, it's *pop culture reference*"" that it just sort of became eye-rolling. It also felt dead-obvious where the story was heading that the 140 minute runtime felt like 3/4 hours. 

Overall it was mostly dumb and completely forgettable, with characters that were either bland, cliched, annoying, or all three combined. Not terrible, it passed the time well enough to where I didn't hate it but I'm sure if I digested it more I'd find more to pick at. 

The Shining sequence was my favourite moment of the film but it eventually made me wish I was watching that instead. ",87yv63
dwv6898,"In the immortal words of Albert Goldman: ""Betrayed...bewildered.""

I genuinely wanted to like this film.  I may not have been running to the theater with excitement, but I figured at the very least it would be a fun popcorn flick and a good excuse to warm up my Movie Pass card.  Plus, I mean, it's Spielberg.

I think most of us can agree that 'The Shining' scene was thoroughly fun to watch, but beyond that the film just felt hallow.  I wasn't hooked at all during any of the exposition, I couldn't care less about any of the characters or their goals, Sorrento was at worst a barely-threatening villain, the dialogue was just awful, the references were forced and largely underutilized, and the story overall just felt so disjointed and uninteresting.

While I was watching it all I kept thinking was, ""what the hell is going on here?  Am I watching Avatar?  Guardians of the Galaxy?  Thor?""  Then it occurred to me how much I'd rather be watching one of those films instead of a half-assed attempt at mashing them up and throwing in a couple rapid-fire DeLorean shots.

There are some spectacle movies you go into knowing exactly what to expect like the Fast series, Pacific Rim, etc., that maybe aren't the best, but you have a blast anyway. Then there are some movies that you go into that way exceed expectations like Edge of Tomorrow.

dwjx9vr,"I'm truly impressed by the overwhelmingly positive reception I've seen here on reddit. Look, it's great that y'all enjoyed it, but I thought it was an awful movie, super cringy and corny, and just very boring overall. Maybe it's because I didn't care at all for any character, or any of the references (I mean, I like BTTF and Halo, but having a DeLorean and a crew of Master Chiefs there doesn't make the movie any better).

dwrytj7,"Maybe I'm a snobby purist or something, but The Shining section really got under my skin, made me feel icky. It reduces one of the 20th century's most complex and terrifying pieces of art to an amusement park ride. It compresses things loaded with meaning in their original context into easily replicated, widely recognized, obvious IP elements. It cheats. I found it acceptable in some sense with things like the Delorean, King Kong, Batman, etc. These things are already, in some sense, theme park attractions. King Kong has been painted on the walls of enough NYC tourist traps. The Back to the Future ride at Universal ran for years. You can replicate these things without damaging their original meaning. This is, in my opinion, not the case with a film like The Shining, and I found it offensive and off-putting.",87yv63

There was definitely some pacing problems like the sudden tone shift after the attack explosion and again after the IOI raid. But overall, I think they managed to cover most of the important plot points while keeping a cohesive story.

It's been a few years since I read the book and I could be misremembering, but I was impressed with how well the characters matched their book counterparts. Wade and Artemis could have benefited from more meaningful character development, but I wasn't expecting much depth from a popcorn flick like this. That said, I would have liked to see some more exploration of the loyalty centers and other negative social impacts of the RPO future other than the corporate hegemony. 

The comedy was pretty good and the visuals were a treat (assuming you can ignore the creepy eyes). Much like the book, if you are a fan  of the overwhelming number of references and don't mind some mindless fun, I think you'll enjoy it.

I'm seriously considering going back to see it in 3 D once the crowds start to wane. ",87yv63

It's nothing spectacular story wise and the characters are highly cliché but as a spectacle its hard to say it doesn't deliver. I only wish the final battle was a little longer. Could have shortened the exposition in the beginning for that.

dwh1vkh,"I just watched it, and having read the book, I must say that it’s pretty good on certain aspects, but a letdown on another.

Some parts are true to the book and some are adapted for convenience or fun. There are a lot of things in the book that couldn’t be portrayed well to the movies, like the near-perfect reenactment of an entire movie, and changing it to cool scenes like the shining one, which I happen to laugh my ass off during it. The hunt is simplified so that the players just get the three keys, rather than get a key, find the gate, pass the gate, and repeat until three keys are obtained. Reasonable for compacting the movie and cutting the runtime. Some awesome parts of the book didn’t make it to the movie though, like Ogden Morrow’s avatar releasing his OP-ness to beat the Sixers in the zero-gravity club (in the book he hosted the party himself, so he’s *really* annoyed at that time lmao).

However, in the movie, the video-gaming aspect in the hunt is really short, very much less than what I expected. I think the only scene we see someone playing a game to progress the hunt is when Wade is playing Adventure at the really end. The book got some cool gaming portions, although time-consuming: the Joust duel for the first key, the attempt for the perfect Pac-Man run to get the quarter (that later give him an extra life), and the race between Parzival vs. *eighteen* Sixers to beat Halliday’s Tempest highscore during the final gate. I think these scenes would be great to portray the dedication of the hunters. I would really love to see a kind of montage of Parzival just intensely playing Tempest with the assistance of Art3mis telling him the game’s extra lives exploit, but alas, the movie disappoints me in that aspect.

All in all, it’s a fun movie. It’s one of the better movies that takes gaming nostalgia (looking at you, Pixels, god why do you have to be so awful).

dx4ornq,"As someone who really enjoyed the book, I loved this movie. Sure some things were changed, but that doesn't mean they were worse at all.

If I had to nitpick, I wish they would have elaborated a little more on how the location of the third key was found, it felt a little rushed after all of the build-up for the first and some build-up for the second. I guess IOI just bruteforced it, but what did they go off of? How did they get the proper sector to bruteforce? Perhaps this was mentioned and I just missed it...either way it was glossed over a little quickly considering just how hard it was to find the first and even second keys.

My one other small nitpick is did anything trigger the ballroom dance for the Jade Key? They were in The Shining and had a time limit, then figured out that Kira was the key / was in the photo and alluvasudden the ballroom dance started. Did they actually *do* anything to trigger this or would this have triggered anyway if some random Joe Shmo was wandering around The Shining? I hope they had to trigger it somehow, because otherwise it'd be painfully obvious for anyone who stumbled in there to see the key pages, hear the ballroom dance start up that is clearly not from The Shining, and see the woman standing out in the crowd of zombies and know they have to get to her to get the key despite not knowing who she was or why she was important.",87yv63

Was great in the nostalgic Oasis (the opening bits as seen in the trailer were excellent) and kind of dragged in the real world as they dumped in exposition.  The avalanche of cameos was fun to desperately try to keep up on.  [I was sad they changed the dance party so much from the book.](#spoiler)

3/4 stars.  It's fun, not as fun as it could have been.  H in particular is a delight.

I’m just saying, if you enjoy both for what they are, they’re both really fun. 

People forget Jurassic Park was vastly different than the source material, and people loved both. Hell, Passion of the Christ isn’t a faithful adaptation of THE BIBLE. 

Can’t ever go into a movie assuming it will be done as well as the book. They did a great job, as a book lover. ",87yv63
dwhj7nb,"I really enjoyed it. It was quite different from the book, but I thought it worked for what they needed to do to bring it to the screen. 

Some of the stuff they changed was lame - like how easy it was for Artemis to get out of IOI. I also missed having Ogden in the finale, and the sequence with chasing the van at the end was not particularly impressive. I also didn't really care about the female villain. Parcival seemed really dumbed down from the book - it felt like he was destined to win in the book, but not in the movie at all. It felt like he just fell into it.

I did like how they changed up the challenges - made them more adaptable for a movie and exciting to watch. I liked how they brought in the Iron Giant, and bringing us in to the real world more. The character development wasn't great, but still better than the book. It definitely got the Spielberg treatment, but not in a bad way. I'm happy with it.

While it is not the best movie I have watched in 2018 so far as it has some plot issues, it has definitely piqued my interest in reading the book as it seems like there some details that were glossed over and left out. (Its only after reading this thread that I realise they change alot plotwise as well) Spoilers below:

However my problems with this film is that they are trying to cover too many aspects in 2.5 hr, making the movie less focused and the ending rather weak (the socioeconomic problems still persists, they just change the leader at the end). Its a pity as they set up in such a way that there is addiction problem (the aunt's bf) and how the real world is so shit that people actually escape into the game and how people got into debt and slog their lives off to the game company but none of those stuff are further developed/solved later on. The game mechanics and set up arent fully explained, which makes the player vs player thing too much of a deus ex machina and I am disappointed that many players just ended up as fodders in the story. 

The ancient artifact shit looks interesting as well. But so far they only use that orb thingy which is disappointing for me. I thought more of such artifacts will be used or maybe it already does but I cant differentiate it from regular game items. 

I guess it is also partly due to a mismatch of expectations since it is actually formulaic and targeting kids for audience which results in the disappointment, but nonetheless its still a good movie to sit back and watch relaxingly. ",87yv63

That being said, I thought that the 1st and 2nd act set the bar so high that the 3rd act couldn't live up to it. It wasn't bad at all, it just was kinda standard. I also wish that they had developed the supporting characters a little more. Overall the film was still very fun and satisfying.",87yv63

Surprisingly the live action parts did not take away from the experience. The intensity lasted until the end of the movie and never really dragged as they went from zero gravity dancing to that war zone to the fucking shining.

I'm referring to the scene where heroes raced to prove their self worth by illustrating to their peers that they share all of the same favorite things as everyone else in the group, and then through the power of rehashing, rebooting, and mashing up the surface level properties of all of those things they are blindly reverent towards into one giant meaningless clusterfuck of intellectual property, they cure world hunger and/or launch a monument to Second Life into outer space?

The action race scene in the beginning was great and visually appealing and also, the small references made it great. Although there are a few things I didn't really like as much as I thought.     

First thing, and no matter how many times Steven say's it in his interviews, he is not a gamer. This movie for me has a nod on 80s movie culture,though it didn't feel the same with videogames. It felt a little off with a few dialogues and what represents a gamer. Also, I really didn't like the ending scene compared to the book. The books ending was what made it perfect for me and (for me personally) why I found it relatable. ""And for the first time in as long as I could remember, I had absolutely no desire to log back into the OASIS"". to me it was perfect because really that's what I kinda want aswell. I love videogames and movies. But having something in the outside world even more precious is something every person really wants. The movie didn't achieve that for me which I was fairly disappointed about. That's kinda why I don't think Spielberg was a perfect director for this movie. But was good enough. He doesn't have a good idea on what videogames means besides the base 'escaping reality' idea.

Besides those comments though I think I loved everything else.  It was a great watch and does well in the changes that it made from the book. If anything, parzival getting a 1up in 're movie was better than the book. Even if it doesn't make sense how og can be a butler and do his real world stuff. It's great into going in-depth of how halliday came to be and the acting and characters were perfect. ",87yv63
dwgx7mk,"I will preface my reply with I really liked this movie and I really liked the book. I am a child of the 80's and my screen name should give you a clue as to when I was born. That said the changes that were made from the source material were completely understandable. By updating some of the pop culture references, it gave children of the 90's and 00's something to understand/reminisce about/look for. If it was an exact replication of the book, so many people would have been left out of the discussion/enjoyment. Speaking of the book, I like how they changed the movie quests. Showing Z just quoting/lip syncing movie lines would have been boring on the screen. Not sure why the movies themselves were changed (rights I guess). Having everyone already in Columbus just sped things up and showing them traveling there would have been boring to watch on the big screen. Overall I think Spielberg changed just enough to update the book so a wide audience could enjoy the ride. My overall complaint was the lack of music. No Oingo Boingo Dead Man's Party during the intro/death notice. No Rush (other than a poster and Aech's t-shirt. There is music on the soundtrack, that I did not hear (or maybe I missed/scene was cut) in the movie.",87yv63

Had the cops been called sooner, maybe the heroes could have been protected or something? Or Nolan maybe could have been investigated sooner had they turned that confession over sooner.

So maybe my perspective got coloured by good company.

That in mind, I think the 'romance' subplot actually has more hook and chop than people are giving it. The main character *does* play the very typical ""oh i've met you twice so now i love you"" thing straight, but Artemis straight-up rejects him -- nicely -- because he doesn't know her at all. He's literally created a fantasy *from* a fantasy. She's absolutely right, but she's obviously interested: it's not a ""go away creep"", but it's not full acceptance, either.

One theme they used quite strongly in that scene was 'touch' -- the new suit the main character got had actual physical feedback, which is certainly not the norm for most players. It also seems like they're both what, late teens, early twenties? They're not super experienced with 'love' or physical stuff; they use the Oasis in the same way many young gamers do, as a 'safe' zone to explore those things. Particularly in the dance club where Artemis is quite handsy -- because she's comfortable and safe in the Oasis, while in 'real life' she believes herself not capable of that kind of thing.

I feel ike there's an undertone of sense deprivation going on. These people spend so long in the Oasis itself they're losing 'touch' (HO HO HO) with reality. So when two young people meet for the first time, share interests, are attracted to each other, have lived in a somewhat sensually deprived life... well, birds and bees, yadda yadda.",87yv63

It was the magic of E.T. that astounded audiences across the world. Their is no remnant of that in this film. Except for the last 20-25 minutes. This splicing of tones was unfavourable in my opinion. The day has been saved and all is hunky dory at the end and we got a little remnant of magic in the film that we so eagerly desire and miss in cinema today. But much of the film unfortunately lacked this. Overall the teenage drama harry potter-esq world building was good and I enjoyed it for the most part. However the dubiousness to set a certain tone reduced this films strengths.

Secondly, the characterization was simply awful. Except for an A-social and damaged performance by Mark Rylance. I couldn't sing praises of any other cast members. I think it bottles down to writing however. While both of our leads and side characters all had potential the weakness of unique qualities you remember in characters was severely lacking. I can't tell you how many times I've watched a 21st century film with ""guy mcdude."" As our lead and ""spunky mcindependat."" as our love interest. Give me a break with this. Make likable heroes that we can root for. Characters like Han Solo, (pre-disney-fication) Rocky, Tony Stark. These are the characters that win hearts of fans and become unique and likable in our outrageous action blockbusters.

World building would get a B minus. Their are efforts to establish an interesting world and universe but the extravagant places of films like harry potter, the cantina and death star of Star Wars, These are places that give us a sense of geography. While this film did present a unique and fascinating world, I was wanting more as well as a pathway of location.

One last point, The films visual was a high point. A strategic decision; the video game graphic-look worked in its favour. In our over computerized and praying-for-practical-simplicity films these days, the look of the film never felt computerized or digital simply because... well that was the point. So I applaud the visual style of this film. Primarily the ending battle which had a unique colour pallet and art direction which many films have had as bleh as the main colour of current past. I'm looking at you Synder!

Immensely enjoyable film and fun for everyone of pop culture and gaming alike. I had no issue with the over saturation of references. Why not I say. If films like Cabin in the Woods and Deadpool can overtly reference the film industry. I think this film does the same simply with references towards gaming and pop culture.

Soundtrack was forgettable but did excel with the electronic parts. I have to mention also that the soundtrack tone was dubious too! Why not pick a strong sound and use that one sound to set a tone with music. You were the king of this Spielberg come on! While I enjoy Alan Silvestri and regard him as one of the kings of 80's movies, I was sensing a bit of rushed film composing and many tired hands cooking the single pot with this soundtrack.

To conclude I found this film enjoyable and interesting. Primarily different which is lacking so much these days so I applaud that. But as I mentioned many points of this film degraded it from being a franchise monolith potential to being a ""cool"" film that your watched that one time.

dwokjd7,"I read the book before seeing the movie and really enjoyed it. Because I knew a movie was being made while I was reading the book I got excited thinking about what they could've done.  However,  when I went to see the movie I was extremely disappointed. They only got four of the high fives names right and that is pretty much the extent of what they kept from the book. Had I not been so disappointed by the differences between the book and the movie I might have been able to enjoy it more.",87yv63
dwq2yn4,"I'll say from the start i've never read the book, so I can't really offer a comparison however, looking solely from a film perspective I really enjoyed it.

There are of course a few lapses in time, and thing's that might not be explained all too well, [I mean all that time to find the first key, yet two and three happen so quickly](#spoiler), but as a pure cinema experience I loved it.

Growing up in the nineties many of the references would have flown right over me, however what's not to like about a fantasy world where you race round in a Dolerean against monster trucks, the batmobile and other cool stuff!

The beginning and end scenes also provide a reminder of why I always have, and probably always will, play video games. Awesome moments like that, that you can live in and enjoy with friends and the awesome feeling when you do something cool or succeed together.

All in all I was really excited to go and see this film and personally, it didn't disappoint. Me and my Girlfriend walked away discussing what our avatar would look like and what vehicle we would have for the opening action scene and i feel that sums the film up well, it gets you imagining all the possibilities. (incase you want to know mine was a toss up between the car from men in black and a speeder bike from star wars)",87yv63
dwrpq1z,"Ugh. It was good.

But I was hoping for *more*.

I really wanted this to be an epic, Blade Runner-esque dystopian future, with real stakes and a serious undertone.

At certain points it felt like a grown up version of Spy Kids.

I guess after reading the book I had higher expectations. I just wish we'd have gotten a longer backstory on Wade, a much longer first dance sequence, and a much much longer final battle.

Also there's no Easter egg at the end. Such a weird oversight. ",87yv63

Other than that I haven't had as much pure fun seeing a movie in a long time. All those references that make you point your finger and go 'ay'. Director Krennic mentioning Star Wars, the Arkham Knight by virtue of surprising me and well everything else.  

Sure you wonder how nobody in 4 years found something as easy as 'going backwards', he wasn't being too subtle there. A corporation that enslaves people, a rebellion that doesn't really do much rebelling against the evil virtual........ Empire? It doesn't explain much of the real world stuff but hey all the Oasis stuff is an absolute blast. Very enjoyable movie.   

Also Hannah John-Kamen is randomly showing up in movies nowadays. Tomb Raider, this and soon to be the main villain in Ant-Man 2. She's slowly going places.",87yv63

dwyqc06,"I really did not like the book, but I was really looking forward to seeing the movie. I think the concept of the Oasis and the base of the story in general is *so* cool, I was sure it was going to translate really well on screen. Also, I wouldn't have to endure long descriptions of all the visual references the author wanted to include, but instead just see them.

I got exactly what I wanted out of this movie. My two thoughts when it was over: ""This movie was fucking stupid, and I loved it."" I physically cringed and rolled my eyes many times, but I was entertained. I was disappointed that the one scene I was really looking forward to seeing played out was removed, but what it was replaced with went well. [I'm referring to the scene where Wade has to basically perform roles in movies, and instead it was replaced with the whole Shining thing](#spoiler).

I also think the movie was brilliant in that everything that was unbelievable and stupid [(falling in love IMMEDIATELY. the entire crowd suddenly has signs to cheer on the High Five right as everything is wrapping up. etc.)](#spoiler) was simply an 80's movie trope and therefore meta and, frankly, awesome. I'm 32 and don't like the 80's or 80's movies, so I didn't even get some of the references. I had to wonder if all the kids in the theater with me would like it at all with missing a lot of that, but maybe it isn't so important. Considering I don't like the 80's genre, in that sense the things I complain about simply mean the book and movie weren't for me.

In summary, I liked the movie and think it's worth a watch especially in theaters. It's simply fun, and some of the acting is phenomenal. In the book, I didn't like or believe Halliday. It seemed so stupid that someone would be SO FUCKING OBSESSED in the way he was, but the way the character was portrayed in the movie, it made it completely believable. He was the best part of the movie.",87yv63
dx064pd,Mark Rylance was great but I'm a bit bummed out at learning that most of his good lines and little character moments in this movie \(the ones I didn't initially recognize as references\) were usually his character quoting someone else. There's something a little bit hollow in that.,87yv63

dwrqsbh,"I really wanted to like Ready Player One. I really did. But overall it felt really superficial and left me disappointed.

I know the pop culture references are the movie's main draw. I get that. They would have been acceptable if they weren't used as smoke and mirrors to distract from an otherwise mediocre story.

The characters were underdeveloped, the villain was bland, the story world was unconvincing, and the final theme of ""enjoying reality"" felt shoehorned.

After a while, the overwhelming amount of pop culture references became frustrating and painful, and ultimately felt like a crutch. It felt like the movie kept making all these references of far better stories because it couldn't even stand on its own two legs.

While the visuals and spectacle are indeed stunning, spectacle does not make a good movie.

Anyways the movie was fine I guess. All the real-world resistance stuff felt ridiculous and poorly-done to me.

Spielberg’s direction is scintillating and he brings kinetic energy & style to every scene. The combined use of handheld and slick steady cam in the real world and OASIS respectively shows Spielberg has so much skill and attention to detail as a director.

The film’s just let down by a mediocre script. There’s too much exposition, some of the dialogue felt stilted and the characterisation isn’t as strong as I’d hoped for.

I unfortunately just don’t think Sheridan‘s a leading man; however, Olivia Cooke was great, as was Mark Rylance (despite the latter being underused). T.J. Miller’s character was fun. https://iwandm.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/ready-player-one-review/",87yv63

That said, it had one of the most patronizing scripts I've ever seen.  Every time I thought they were over explaining something, they doubled down and kept explaining it.

dwioi31,"I feel like this is definitely a movie that works only because it's Spielberg. It's weird that it's a big loud movie but he manages to keep it subtle? Or at least approachable. And he still does give a good sense of wonder.

I really did like how the OASIS scenes didn't feel like I was just watching an animated movie. It felt grounded in a weird way.

The biggest problems is the plot doesn't really go too deep or to anywhere you didn't expect and it doesn't quite nail the message it's trying to say at the end. And the references that do get explained can feel so insincere. Doesn't help that the characters only know them because they look up to some 80s geek and don't feel like they like any of the stuff they're actually talking about. I get that most of my issues come from the book though. Oh and it's a bit too long. Felt like it got the exposition done at a really good pace but the third act just goes on too long. 

But it still works mostly. And visually I thought it was fun to look for the references and well directed with some pretty fun action scenes. Fast but not too hard to keep track of. The soundtrack does give it a nice classic adventure feeling too. Could've used licensed music a bit better I thought. Missed opportunity there.",87yv63
dwj5k37,"As a book reader, I tried to watch this as an objective adaption inspired by the novel. There was some really fun action parts like the opening sequence and the final battle. Thought it was hilarious there was a group of 10+ Master Chief avatars in the last battle too, everyone would totally pick him if the Oasis was real.

 However, I think Spielberg went full cheese in the last 10 minutes of the film. Him not shooting Wade because he had the egg in his hands was a little much. Followed by the whole ""the world is outside waiting for a press release, better kiss this girl first.""

Went with a group of people and one friend hadn't read the book. His statement after was pretty on point. He said he liked the visuals and could tell the general plot idea ""OASIS, 3 keys, easter egg, etc"" was a good one but the film made some weird decisions.",87yv63
dwjoe09,"First off, I haven't read the books, so if I seem to be ignorant please excuse me.
I really enjoyed the movie. As other people in this forum have mentioned the romance and stuff seemed cringey, but I really appreciated that they didn't dwell on it much. They focused on the game, the animation, the plot, the ""adventure"" and of course, the references. They did what they could with the limited time and J feel that they did it well...
From what else I've heard, the references in the book are a bit dated. So I also really liked that they added some more recent stuff, Tracer, The Iron Giant, other stuff I can't remember right now. 

And what I really liked is the end where he doesn't sign the contract directly. It's not necessarily the best plot twist or anything, but it was a good ""feel good moment"" for me. Kinda... 

Finally I don't think this movie will age very well... But I might be wrong...

He has, once again, demonstrated in this film that he knows how to direct films - especially films like this is nature where there are lots of visual effects and vigorous cinematography at play in this relatively big-scale project. While I haven't read the book, I can confidently say that I enjoyed this film a lot! The visual effects were stunning, especially in the car race scene at the beginning of the movie. The camera work combined with the action of the race and visually appealing effects and CGI was very impressive and a joy to consume. There were references to various video games, anime and manga, and iconic things that stood out and defined these video games, anime and manga. There were also references to some movies, including [*The Shining*, which is a cult classic horror film where it is well known that the author of the book of which the movie was adapted from did not like the movie adaptation of his book; The Shining](#spoiler). Seeing all the references and recreation of [*The Shining*](#spoiler) while mashing it up with the *Ready Player One* virtual world was a very creative choice and made me ecstatically elated seeing all these references, which I recognised and understood, being incorporated into *Ready Player One*. The soundtrack in this film was also very nostalgic and complemented the film quite a bit. *Ready Player One* clocks in with a run time of around 2 hours 20 minutes, which is a relatively long movie. This movie is long due to an unnecessarily bloated final act. The film also had some noticeable clichés and a cheesy ending. Overall though, this film was a visual feast and a joy to watch. It was very enjoyable. I highly recommend that you go check this film out, especially if you find yourself at least the slightest bit on the nerdy side. Watch this film on the biggest screen you can possibly watch it on. You'll thank yourself later for treating yourself to a bigger screen as you'll be able to fully experience this visually amazing film. I give this film an 8/10.

For people who read the book, I think a LOT will be disappointed on how much this movie does not match the book.  

- ENTIRE sequences never in the book appear in the movie

- Vice Versa, entire major story elements present in the book are not in the movie.

- MUSIC:  WHY play a Rush song during the trailer but never in the movie?  The book makes it clear how important the band Rush is to Haliday.  In addition, it was a missed opportunity not to play AC/DC Dirty Deeds during the last fight sequence as it is in the book and would have been a nice touch.  There are songs in the movie that never appear in the book and songs in the book which would have been totally appropriate for this movie, never show.  Depeche Mode's World in My Eyes, Aha's Take on Me, etc.  The end credits music with Hall and Oates was lame.  If anything, they could have ended with a Rush song there.

- Pacing felt extremely rushed and key concepts shoe-horned in.  The five main characters were never really established as the ""High Five"" until a few mentions at the END of the movie, etc.

- Splitting the Sorrento character into essentially two characters in the movie (himself and that lady who does his dirty work) was stupid, trivial and unnecessary.   Sorrento in the book would have no problem killing anyone himself.  The movie Sorrento is a spineless wuss.

This movie was basically just a shell of the book and only Ready Player One in name.  It strayed so far from the original work that it's easy to see why people who read the book don't jive with the movie.  Visually pleasing.  Worth the price of admission but not worth the hype.  

Controversial:  I would have much rather they split the movie into two parts to get better faithful adaptation with the book because the story from the book is amazing.",87yv63

dwhesds,"So I have to say, I loved this movie, and I am a huge fan of the book. Those two statements are not being seen together nearly enough regarding RPO. I get that the movie is not the book and vice versa. Everyone knows the book is better. That much is stated about every book turned movie, and its even printed on many t-shirts and bumper stickers. That being said, I loved this movie as a second telling of the same story. I would say it is very loosely based on the book (as most book to film adaptations are). I choose to see it as a second version of the same story told by Spielberg rather than Cline. In that view, it was a great and entertaining movie. Its like if you told two creative geniuses to tell you a story about the titanic; of course you know the key points, but the stories will be completely different. That's how I chose to view this movie, and I loved it. I knew from the get go that it would likely be the case, since I first saw the preview and couldn't identify any of the scenes from the book. I will say for what it was, I enjoyed it and so did my kids (who have not read the book yet). I will watch it again.

dwjoemu,"[BOOK SPOILERS AHEAD, DON’T READ IF YOU HAVEN’T READ IT AND INTEND TO]

I’ll start by saying I am a huge fan of the book. Huge fan. So I went in with some trepidation, not being hugely taken with the trailers. I am Pleased to say that as a book adaption this was way more Lord of the Rings than The Hobbit.

I mean compared to the book it felt like the entire thing was on fast forward. My brother commented before we went in that the book should have been made into a two-parter, and of course it is a long film at 2 plus hours, but at times it felt rushed, the relationship with Artemis was especially rapid. I think the first key as simply being an impossible race to win was too easy, such a shame the DnD tome wasn’t featured, and then endless games of Joust, but then who wants to watch endless games of joust on the big screen? Well I would certainly have gone for one or two! But then the clue to winning was well hidden I suppose. 

The characters were mostly strong. Artemis, Wade and H especially, Daito and Sho less so, more back story for those two would have helped flesh them out more than being a) young and b) Oriental. They were stronger characters in the books, although one has a very different fate in the books, having been killed. I don’t think it weakened the story though: we know IOI are lethal.

IROK was a interesting and ok addition to the book narrative. The look was so over the top to be acceptable, I mean he is the ultimate punisher. And then played with a comedic touch by TJ Millar. I mean I love the man, ever since his dopey cameraman in Cloverfield. He was this film’s Drax or the Kiwi gladiator in Thor: Ragnorak. I truly empathised when he lost all his shit, any gamer has been halted by saving glitches, or games deleted to make you start over ENTIRELY. I remember a particularly painful one in Tomb Raider III. I still have flashbacks. 

Another huge addition was The Shinning Hotel. I am ambivalent about it, not sure it worked as well as the rest. 

I do wish the they had used the deus ex machina as the extra life like they did in the book, a perfect game of PAC-MAN which took ages to achieve IIRC. And all the reward is a simple Quarter. It is a very well played DEM in the book, perfectly unveiled. I guessed the quarter he won from the bet was the extra life immediately. Although I had no clue that the curator was Morrow. I was thinking he was being under-used vis-vis the book but then he pops up At the end and reveals he played a significant part. 

Great moments: I really wish I had played Doom more, I assume Planet Doom is from the game? Anyway the first depiction of it as a FPS was so on point. I don’t play them as they make me dizzy. The charge of the gamer twats was pretty epic. And was a very solid translation from the book. Very Ride of the Rohirrim, spine-tingling.

So 9/10 from me. Saw it IMAX, think it deserves it. Does the book proud, visually stunning, strong characters and a few worthy laughs.",87yv63

The VR world (and gadgets) was a 10/10. Even if the GCI wasn’t the today movie type of GCI it was still good because of the storyline (and because VR is a game yeah I understand why that type of cgi).

dwrgjt8,"Just got back from Ready Player One, my thoughts.

First, I think its important to note who I am. I have never read the books, I watched the main trailer and I really wasn't going into this with any big exciting feels. Its a gaming/nerd thing, the internet was abuzz about it and I wanted to give it a shot.

The short, it wasn't great. 

The acting was fine. It had story elements that would have been amazing if done well, but instead it missed the mark everywhere. A villain that you knew was useless and was never worried about him. An ""in game"" villain that could have been great, but ultimately was underutilised and not given their moment.

A final battle that could have had potential but eh fck all that noise i guess!

The 3d was shit. Which was the worst part about this. They could have done real people in some cases, they could have rendered characters and places better, they could have done this whole thing better.

I don't want to talk about the movie and its failings, I'd rather talk about the story elements as some of them struck a nerve with me.

First, maybe this was a book decision, but Halliday, was a character that people thought of nerds as in the 90s or earlier. An anti-social geek who can't form attachments with people, knows anything related to gaming or ""nerd""/""geek"" universes, and digs their head into their programming. Thats not who gamers are anymore and as I got that label and was parts of that person, it made me upset like it did when I was a kid.

However that Halliday character could have been redeemed! There was a story of love in the movie that Halliday never got, a story of friendship that he never had. A story of lonliness that was not only felt by him, but everyone who entered the oasis. There was a moment in the very beginning where Wade is going to the ground from his home. Everyone is isolated in VR. Except this one older lady at hte bottom, who is tending to her garden.

This could have been a powerful moment used later on, the fact that Wade had a connection with a real person at some point. Hell what about Wade finally meeting friends he knew only online in the real world. The power of friendship and reality meet. 

The oasis is a special place, but this movie could of had 15 or more messages to bring the movie together, instead it danced around all these ideas.

But lets go back to what this movie was promising i guess. It wasn't a serious movie, it wasn't supposed to have messages or bring to light problems we are facing now in our own society. It was supposed to be a pop culture filled ride, filled with references to days of the past. To say it bluntly, Wreck it Ralph did it better.

A lot of references were on the screen so briefly I spent more time wondering if I had seen that, then laugh or go wow I know who that was!

dwh3wda,"for what I wanted to see, I liked it, it'll be a classic for kids and adults alike like the goonies.

the kids as the ninja turtles and then the teenager boys as halo players was perfect, the references were so obvious though, why not do some more obscure ones especially for the gundam, should've had Norris' Gouf custom or, one of the rocket league cars instead of the Delorean.

it was good, I don't have any complaints, 1000% better than that pacific rim sequel trash. 

good visuals, story was predictable, the one ""leak"" that ruined a plot change was overblown imo, like samantha said to her when she got in the van and said ""not what you predicted"" she said so what? that is the perfect response.

Iron giant got good screen time, Chuckie was cracking me up, actually alot of the scenes in the movie cracked me up especially when they kicked the bad woman out of the van and she bounced off the pavement that was hilarious for some reason.

what did bother me though is...5 years....not one person didn't go backwards on the track? lol cmon guys every video gamer here would've done that by the 4th race once they realized no one's getting past king kong.

I can see them ""zeroing"" out being a good indicator of why but they were zeroing' out every race anyway.

dwgmqlf,"It's not the truest adaptation of the book and I think that's a good thing. I enjoyed the hell out of it because it has something that I think the book lacked: a master of their craft at the helm. 

Thinking about it as the credits rolled, I couldn't point to many directors other than Spielberg who could've done as good a job as he did with the film--in addition to getting the rights to so many pop culture references as he did. Obviously it wasn't just him doing that, but how many people would wanna say no to being a part of a celebration of what Spielberg created and championed throughout his career? 

I think the film has its flaws. Some of the acting is a bit iffy for the side characters, but it wasn't ever distracting. And the dialogue and some jokes didn't quite land for me, again, mostly with the side characters. And I need to see it again but I'm pretty sure the pacing of a few of the real life scenes felt off, or perhaps it was just the script. But the scene with Wade's aunt and her abusive boyfriend just... fell kinda flat for me. I knew from the book that I was supposed to kind of hate/dislike both of them, but the movie tried to have the audience be more sympathetic towards the aunt and I just didn't buy it at all.

But the action sequences (especially the race at the beginning and the *The Shining* scene) are sit-forward-in-your-seat good. I loved the sheer insanity that was playing out on screen, yet Spielberg never lost his touch and I always knew what was going on within the frame. It felt very true to playing a video game in that regard. 

What also felt true to me was the central themes it plays with. Isolation from reality, regret and loss, learning from mistakes--I thought Wade's journey through Halliday's past was poignant and was heightened immensely by Mark Rylance's subtle, quiet dipiction of him. The final scene in his room really, really struck me for some reason and I felt the sort of Spielberg magic I haven't felt in a blockbuster movie for a long time. 

Honestly, I just really dig the film.  I know it's not perfect but... It was fun! Even the changes and deviations from the book worked better for the plot in my opinion. And again, the *The Shining* scene was pitch perfect. No idea how they managed to pull it off so well but holy shit is it great. 

I'd give it a solid B+ rating overall. 

Also, the effects are mindblowingly good. Not necessarily hyper realistic at all times, but real enough to truly wow me. And the amount of bodies on screen coupled with the fluidity and coordination between everything is insane. ILM and the other post studios killed it.

dwh0mdy,"Much like A Wrinkle In Time, I felt like the Ready Player One book served as a basic plot outline for the movie, but the details are vastly different.

The characters, the real world, the Oasis, and the plot are mostly similar to the book, but a whole lot of detail from the book is either dropped or changed because it either wasn't licensed or would be boring on-screen. No one wants to watch someone else play Pac-Man for 3 hours, or recite a movie, or listen to Rush.

My actual opinion on the movie? Without comparing it to the book, it was ok. The race and battle scenes were well-done, the plot was fairly coherent, it moved along at a really good pace, and it had the nice, happy Spielberg ending. Seeing the Oasis as something in which everyone participates was a neat concept, and the Oasis itself was fairly well-done, especially in the beginning when Wade gives us the grand tour. The negatives? The villain Sorrento was horribly two-dimensional, and his motivation for taking over the Oasis was given once in a 20-second bit of dialog. His acting was also bad. Also, we have a basic idea of the other characters' motivations, but there's so much going on in the movie that character development is either halfway done, or not done at all. While all the stuff in the Oasis was cool, the CGI could get a little sketchy. Not sure if there was just too much going on to fully animate it all, or if Spielberg wanted a really fake, artificial look to things, but sometimes I felt like the CGI had just been half-assed.

My opinion when comparing it to the book? I loved the book. No, it was not high literature, but I did love the references because I'm of that generation. I was really looking forward to the barrage of nostalgia in the movie. And I think the movie kind of missed it. Yes, there are tons of visual easter eggs, but the book really (over)emphasized the pop culture stuff. It felt like window dressing in the movie. I'm aware that there were rights issues, which probably explains the lack of Rush music, and I know why all the challenges were changed from the book to the movie (no one wants to watch someone play Pac-Man for three hours), but I just felt like the movie lost the spirit of the book a little.

This is not an all-time classic, which it seems many were expecting it to be. If you are looking for storyline, or social commentary, or acting performances, then look elsewhere. This is not the movie for you.

There are 2 levels on which this movie works - 

1) As fan service to anyone who has been into 'geek culture' for the past 30 years. To see so many of my favourite characters all collected into one place makes me happy. It is pure fan service, and a prerequisite of fan service is to be a fan in the first place. If you are not a fan, then you'll find nothing here. If you are a fan, then I'm sure you'll enjoy an [Alien chestburster coming out of Goro's torso? Gundam fighting Mechagodzilla? Wowee.](#spoiler)

2) As an immersive visual experience - here is where I draw parallels with Avatar. Both movies have fairly bland, generic stories - but the stories are not the main event here, rather they are a canvas or vehicle to carry the viewer into a fantastical world. Vibrant, lush, different from the reality they live in, or any other movie reality they have seen before, and brilliantly rendered. Avatar in the IMAX whilst tripping balls remains my favourite movie experience of all-time, and whilst Ready Player One wasn't on that level (perhaps my sobriety was a factor here), it was still in that same vein of movie, and this is something I enjoyed. It's no coincidence that players in the Oasis are represented by their... wait for it... avatars.",87yv63

I mean yes, it is your classical cheesy story where the good guys win and there is a love story of the main character and his sidekick that you see in every movie but this is literally everything I wanted it to be. The movie is a one big reference to video games and being a huge fan of video games for nearly 20 years, I felt like a little girl throughout the whole movie trying not to scream from excitement. 

It has been almost 24 hour since I watched the movie and I still think about it, some movies are just so hard to get out of, especially when they are everything you have been for your whole life and how close you are to the main character. It was a classic feel good movie and I loved every minute of it.

If your not into video games, then you should go see it just for the ""The Shining"" scene. It was really funny to see how half of the crowd had seen the movie and half of the crowd had no idea what was going on.

The movie was fun and I enjoyed it overall, but I don't think it lived up to what it could have been.

dwlzzv9,"Wow! The action sequences in this movie were incredible; I loved how the camera swept through the  chaos and caught all the little crazy details. 

Also loved that they were able to streamline the plot without sacrificing the book's original tone. 

My only quip is that it pushed the envelope in strange, unnecessary places. Like the naked lady... or the moment H said the f-word... Or the lovetapping sleaze of a boyfriend... None of these enhanced the plot, just jumped out of nowhere, distracting from the overall experience. What with the nemesis in this movie being so incredibly childish and the heros being children themselves, I'd think this movie should be palatable to a young audience. 

Overall, though, very fun and exciting. I'm looking forward to catching it again in 4D. :)",87yv63

The movie was completely amazing. Even though they did not follow the book everything just worked out. The movie held its own in most categories. I know it was great because when me and my wife finished watching it she had bit all her fingernails and then some. I watched it in the regal RPX format and those rumble seats did not disappoint. The visual effects were top notch. The oasis was portaied exactly as i imagined which is a plus. Only thing i did not like was Artemis looked funky definitely not what i imagined and i was upset there was no after credits scene ?? Like common its a movie based on Easter eggs. Overall i think this movie would have taken like four hours if it followed the book. Therefore being almost 2 hours they did a hell of a job. Loved seeing all the different characters.

I thankfully did not have the same experience a number of you apparently had, with people constantly talking and feeling the compulsive need to declare that they recognized references. People chuckled in recognition of The Shining and the Merlin incantation, but that was about it.

If you're playing any type of race car game or if you're doing a race car scene in the movie there's some sort of Music in the background, so why was it completely void of any music???

As a throw-away popcorn movie it's fine I guess, what's odd though is it felt like it was dragging yet at the same time skipped large portions of the book. If you just go for the visuals and grew up in the 80's it doesn't disappoint entertainment wise, but I wouldn't call it a great film.

When the scene came on when he was the only one left on planet doom and he discovered the reverse of the coin. The entire theatre groaned at how unimaginative that plot point was. 
I get it’s a cliche story idea but it was very lazy. 

I’ve not read the book, so I don’t know how accurate it is, but seriously?! 
In a RPG MMO gaming world where artifacts and equipment are thing that modify or enhance abilities, I understand this. But an EXTRA LIFE?! It doesn’t fit in. 
To be pedantic there might be an item that gives a small percentage of surviving death upon a killing hit with negatives side effects etc. But this isn’t just a generic platformer. It just really gripes me from such a vast and wide topic such as gaming they used such a basic and lazy gaming convention as an entire plot device.

I understand that it’s got to be relatable and understanding to those who don’t normally interact with games or the gaming community.
But those people aren’t stupid either, considering that the whole story is about something most people outside gaming wouldn’t know about either. And it could have been something a little more complex.

Sorry for rambling on. I was able to put up with other phrases and comments but that was the last straw! (Or life). Believe it or not I did actually enjoy the film. I came away just wishing I could one day see the day that this happens.",87yv63

Olivia Cooke was stunning and the birthmark on her face was placed to show thay she was insecure and she even said that she looked different in real life, it was also pathetic that Wade had the nerve to tell her that he loved her even if they never met in real life and how social interaction was completely thrown out the window. Especially when Olivia's character called out Wade for being too addicted to the game which woke me completely. I also wanna give an emphasis on the creator of the game which he said that he regretted most of the times he spent on the video game or how he never valued his life. ",87yv63

dx5bjdu,"The film version of Ready Player One was such disappointing garbage. I want my money back.

There was so much potential there and they whiffed it so hard. It had practically zero similarity to the book, which I though was super entertaining and have nothing bad to say about except that it was slightly corny at the end, lol. I’m not surprised Hollywood picked this book up, but I am surprised at what a horrible adaptation of the original book it was.

I even shelled the money to take my girlfriend to the 3D IMAX version at the Arclight all excited for how good it was gonna be. I walked out at the end of the movie slack-jawed, wondering how Spielberg botched a movie involving so much 80’s pop culture that badly. My girlfriend didn’t read the book and thought the movie was fun, said she liked it. Go figure. 

Pretty sure the reason why people are enjoying this movie so much is because they didn’t read the book. Anyone who read the book would realize the plot lines are horrendously incongruent. What were the screenwriters thinking? Where did the race challenge come from? That was not in the book at all. In fact, none of the challenges were at all similar, hardly any, and I mean hardly any, of the old school video game and movie references got dropped, even covertly, which for a director as skilled as Spielberg is incredibly disappointing.

Has anyone else noticed this? This is one of four books over 100 pages that I’ve ever read in one sitting during my entire life. It was so exciting and engaging. I was almost offended by how wildly they changed the plot. They turned it into a explosion-centric, special effects laden shit show and completely extracted the awesome, dystopian intellectualism of the original story. 

The only similarities are the names of the characters, the world, the basic Anorak’s challenge plotline, and the extra life token, which he obtained very differently in the book than in the movie. They don’t even call the bad guys Sux0rz in the movie! I don’t think they should be called they same name honestly, the two are completely different stories. 

I was especially disappointed that they totally chopped Ogg out of the plot. He was one of my favorite characters and he saved the day in the book. They would have failed without Ogg.

I give this movie a 3/10 because it was relatively entertaining. 

The cinematography was good and the special effects were amazing. But the plot was a disaster and bore basically no similarity whatsoever to the book, and that really killed this movie for me. I’d be pissed if I were the author. I guess he’s probably just wallowing in a bathtub of cash...either way, it is a decent action movie from a generic standpoint and if you’re going in cold (haven’t read the original book) you will probably enjoy this if you like Guardians of the Galaxy or The Avengers. It has a similar visual aesthetic. If you read the book and liked it, your reaction to this movie will probably be quite negative, like mine was, unless you think of them as two separate stories. 

PS: I really liked who they picked to play James Halliday and I though his performance was tight.",87yv63

Having read the book, I thought that the cheese was going to be ramped up to almost unbearable levels but I thought that the movie did a great job of being serious and nostalgic without it being cringey.

Other than expecting it to be cheesier, the movie was pretty much what I thought it would be. Fun, good but not great (I mean, the plot is rushed and forced but they did what they could given the time they had), and visually incredible.

But then, on the same level as “Wreck It Ralph”, you see plenty of other characters and icons that you’re familiar with popping up as cameos. Instead of it being so in-your-face, they’re in the background with something to do but surprise you in a way that triggers your nostalgia.

This movie is the closest thing you’ll get to a MUGEN adaptation if I’ve ever seen one because, instead only putting several pop culture characters in here, they brought EVERYTHING! From movies, anime, manga, TV, and video games, the film embraces the lore of pop culture and presents it to you in in the best way possible. “Ready Player One” is a huge love letter to the 80s from the gaming, music, and movies. Adam Sandler is currently beating himself up as we speak for fucking up “Pixels” so bad.

To see this written world of Cline’s OASIS come to life is amazing. Whenever the film focuses on the OASIS, which is the primary reason you’re going to see this movie anyway, the film shines. The OASIS is such a spectacular, visual splendor to look at that you’re immediately immersed into the world. It has the “Wakanda effect” where this fictional world has so much imagination and clever ideas flowing like a systematic community that you wish it was real so you could live there (or at least visit).

Besides the production design of the OASIS and the effects used for the characters that pop up, the movie also delivers with the motion capture. The motion capture utilized here is incredible in the same vein as “The Adventures of Tintin” was; not only can you tell how virtual these people are, but they’re also well-designed. Each lead’s virtual avatar embodies some sort of facial resemblance to their real life counterpart so you can easily distinguish which character is who. Granted, some of the designs bizarrely reminded me of Besson’s “Arthur and The Invisibles” but that's neither here nor there.

dwloe79,This could have been the best movie of all time and it fucking sucked ass. ,87yv63
dwgm64d,"Loved the movie! Got some serious Black Mirror vibes that I wish could’ve been explored more but it obviously wasn’t that kind of film

I also think the beginning of the film moved a little too fast and I wish it was less of a romance, would’ve given more screen time to the really cool world that had been created.  ",87yv63
dwgm6ay,Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. Loved all the characters both in the oasis and outside of it. ,87yv63
dwgn4gg,"Certified Fresh on RT with 79%, reddit on suicide watch?",87yv63
dwgn985,"Fantastic movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie was mostly inspired by the book and was almost completely altered in a very good way. Each scene was so full of visual delights and references that I will have to see it again. Also, I loved how they introduced VR, they chose to show rather than tell and I think it worked wonderfully.

Great movie. Would recommend. 9/10",87yv63
dwgojru,"I'm a third of the way through the audiobook which I highly recommend, narrated by /u/Wil and he's nailing it so far.

That said, I was hesitant to go to the movie to spoil everything.  It was very fun to watch a movie BASED on the book.  And I'm happy that I can continue on and enjoy the rest as I'm loving it so far.  ",87yv63
dwguuk6,"It's a fun movie and it kept throwing so many references it was hard to keep track of them all. That being said, I'm not really interested in seeing it again. It's cool watching your favorite video game characters mashed together in one movie but the rest (the plot and the main characters) felt quite uninteresting to me. Especially at the end where [an enormous crowd of people basically lets the main villain kill the heroes and then he has a change of heart for no good reason imo](#spoiler). Some parts felt pretty groan-worthy with the constant message of ""you're not cool in this world unless you know all these pop culture references"". But it's still fun to see with your friends, just not something I'd watch again by myself.",87yv63
dwgykn4,"I actually really enjoyed it! I read the book like 6 years ago so I only remembered the basic storyline, I was just glad to see it on the big screen. The only thing that annoyed me was that a movie about Easter eggs didn’t have an after credits scene lol.",87yv63
dwh0i2i,"As movie on it's own, I'd give it a C, and still worth seeing if you like the genre. As a book adaptation, I'd give it an F. There were some cool scenes, there was pop culture nostalgia, a couple laughs, but character development was non-existent, the bad guys never seemed really all that bad or menacing, you never feel invested in the protagonists' mission, a lot of missed opportunities mixing music with powerful scenes. Just hard to imagine with Ernest Cline developing the screenplay, Spielberg directing, and a whole host of big players behind the scenes, that they couldn't nail down the basic tenants of a good film or keep true with the book. Probably would have been better to go with a trilogy to allow proper character and story development.",87yv63
dwhgnhm,"Questions before seeing this movie. I've never read the book, should I read the book first before seeing this movie? Should I see it in a premium format?",87yv63
dwhoqnh,"Overall, I liked it but didn't love it.  I think he the hands of a worse director it would have been a rough watch, but Spielberg is good enough to make up for its shortcomings.  For reference, I have never read the book.

What I liked: It's a master class in visuals.  The Oasis was amazing, and Ben Mendelsohn is perfect as the sleazy villain. I also really liked Simon Pegg and Olivia Cooke as well.  I have mixed opinions on the references (I elaborate in the next paragraph) but the ones I liked were cool to see, and I had a smile on my face pretty much the whole time.

What I didn't: The reference selection was not always tailored towards my interests, and when I don't have the ""hey that's a thing I like"" feeling it gets kinda boring.  Like I was never a big Halo fan, so seeing a bunch of SPARTANs doesn't do anything for me.  I, like a lot of others, thought the real-world stuff wasn't great.  I'm seeing a lot of praise for it here, but I thought Lena Waithe was distractingly bad.  I also think Tye Sheridan just doesn't have the charisma to carry a movie, I've never particularly been a fan of his. Plotwise, I had some issues. I felt like a lot of the interesting ""investigation"" stuff happened offscreen, and IOI was a bit over-the-top evil for me. Also the romance just didn't work for me. 

I give it a 3/5, but it's a really fun 3/5 and is definitely worth seeing on a big screen.",87yv63
dwhq0no,"I felt overall the book was better than the movie.  Of course the movie had to remove some book details but I felt that the movie focused on the [IOI going after everyone more than the keys and clues which was the part I liked because it had the 80s pop culture references there, so](#spoiler) the movie didn't have the 80s references like the book.  [Also the movie did not give any background on the characters like the book did but again that could have to do with fitting a book into a movie.](#spoiler)  But I still did enjoy the movie as its own stand alone thing.  I would for sure recommend the movie but I still would recommend the book as well if you want a more full experience.",87yv63

dwnhs8s,I give it 7/10 as a stand alone movie. As a book to movie I give it a 5/10. Took out some of my favorite things and made it more appealing to different people I guess. Still a fun movie.,87yv63
dwo0n0y,"In the book, the easter eggs/puzzles are a lot more cryptic to solve and require actual skills/knowledge. They made it so easy and obvious in the movie that it made all the characters not credible to me. I didn't believe one bit that they are the smartest and more diehard fans. The first puzzle especially. Really? you're telling me that NO ONE tried that ever?? That's video game 101.",87yv63
dwo2vg4,"Saw it twice.  

First time I was absolutely baked and there weren't that many people on the theater. 

2 days later I went with family and there was a lot of people, however the audience behaved extremely well! It was really funny to hear the collective ""Oooooh"" when Parzival flipped the quarter to reveal the extra life. 

I also noticed a whole lot of other references on my 2nd watch, and the GG, Parzival sign at the end.

 Entertaining movie, the oasis was gorgeous and super fun, the live action was sub par. It's definitely a 7/10.",87yv63

Major Theme changes caused the cutting of a lot of the 80s nostalgia. I really wanted to like this movie, but it ended up being the worst I've ever seen in theaters where I strongly considered just walking out of it at various points and kinda wish I had.",87yv63

Perhaps the teenagers will love this one.

When I see massive hordes of CGI avatars, I think LORD OF THE RINGS 3 and AVATAR.

When I see someone donning the goggles, I think MATRIX and AVALON

When I see excessively graffitti'd urban areas I think THE WARRIORS and SYNECDOCHE NEW YORK

When I see B055man69 I think EREIAMJH

When I see a perky redhead with great eyes and a real nice shape, I think ""Hot Lohan"" or Emma Stone

When I see a big easter-egg hunt, I think WILLY WONKA and othersuch like IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD

=== === === 

It was hella-fun to see a line of soldiers playing Atari 2600 games, then falling through the virtual ice. 

It was trippy, to think that Halliday uploaded his consciousness into the Oasis, and spent most of his time in his childhood bedroom with his own virtual childhood self.

RenderMan and ILM should win some Oscars for this one....

I like that TJ Miller's real-life person never got explicitly shown.

The action is stunning in its effects and direction, but the characters and story are all a total flatline. The characters have hardly any depth, the pacing is rushed, and some things about the world just don't make any sense.

Easter egs are not meant to be... well, everything on the screen. However, I did get chills with the Gundam vs Godzilla! Since I didn’t watch the trailers, I had no idea there would be a gundam

A lot of the fanservice content removed from the book had to be done to fit a more broad audience but I think you'll still appreciate what they threw in that Cline didn't include.

I really enjoyed it and thought it was a lot of fun. It had several issues that left me scratching my head which I’ll get to, but on the whole, enjoyable popcorn film that definitely entertained me. 

My issues:
- The whole love story between Wade and Sam just felt really awkward and forced in. It was not developed at all, it was just placed there as a “We need a love story!” and I don’t think it worked. It fell really flat. 

- The shoved in backstory about Sam’s dad, and that’s the reason she’s fighting back? Didn’t buy it. If I saw that in her character outside of literally those two sentences I’d have believed it more, but again, it was just tacked on. (Same thing with the Resistance in general - all of sudden we see there’s a concrete, organized effort, and within ten minutes almost everything to do with it storywise is abandoned) 

- When Wade wins, and he meets Halliday - was that a simulation? Was it real? What was going on there? I’m perfectly okay with movies leaving things open ended and not getting answers on some things, but that’s one I really feel like we needed. Maybe I just missed it? I dunno. 

A few other minor details here and there, but those were my main problems - there were a lot of things that just felt tacked on in order to keep moving things forward. 

Definitely a fun watch, lots of cool references to catch, some laughs to be had, but nothing that makes me go “gotta go see that again!”

Book version: When Parzival got the third key, he inspected that the key has a calligraphic “A” that is literally the same style as the one on Anorak’s robe and also adorned on the gates of Castle Anorak, which is a big breakthrough. When he looked up the news, the top story was the IOI discovered the third gate earlier and already put up a magic forcefield around Castle Anorak, confirming his suspicion.

Movie version: I forgot the riddle for the third key, the only thing that I remembered is that Parzival and Art3mis figured out the third key is in Sector 13 (forgot the number), but don’t know exactly on which planet. It probably goes on like the book version, but with the riddle and done off-screen by the Sixers. The High Five only knows the exact location and situation when Art3mis tipped off her insider knowledge to them.

But yeah, I agree that there are some parts that feels like chopped out or need some book information to know what is being talked about.

At a certain point, and I by no means say this applies to even a majority of people though it might, eventually I sort of outgrew seeing my aunt as “aunt XYZ” or “my aunt” because I didn’t see her as often as I did as a kid, and when we did see each other I was now an adult and we’d talk as adults. 

I began my “career life” late due to law school (age 26-27). After about 7 months of moving back to my mom’s house post-graduation at age 26 to look for jobs, I finally found one and moved away.  That’s when I began calling her maybe 2-3x a week...again.  Still do.  (I also had been doing this from senior year of college to my last year of law school, as my dad passed away from cancer beginning of senior year and **I realized that I didn’t just lose my dad, but my mom lost her husband and life partner**.  I wanted to make sure she was ok, since most people her age usually have their spouse by them — and here she was living alone in the big empty house where she had raised a family but now the husband and two sons were out of the house). 

Now when I’d call my mom, usually after a long day of work, like half the time she says “ok hold on, let me get off the phone with aunt XYZ.” 

She talks to my aunt a lot, like how I talk to my brother a lot. 

It makes me realize more that 1) she’s not just my mom but her own, real individual with brothers and sisters and her own problems and goals that have nothing to do with me, now that I’m not a dependent child and 2) that my aunt is probably every bit as important to my mom as a sister as my brother is to me as my brother. 

I realize that **she’s been my mom’s sister for far longer than she’s been my aunt**, as well.  

Still, it’s a weird line but I could see myself accidentally saying it. 

It’s kind of like in *Archer*, where Sterling, a mama’s boy, meets his idol Burt Reynolds, but Sterling holds it against him that he’s dating his mother — and Burt gives sage advice that Sterling needs to stop seeing his mother as “his mother but as her own person” ie as a real, independent individual separate from him who has her own life, personality, problems, and desires, like finding a boyfriend or husband, that are her own.

dwio51k,"I think the answer to this is critical to what made this movie great for me; nothing is a reference for reference's sake.  Every nostalgic IP that is used in this movie isn't for what it means to the audience, it's for what it means to the characters.  This is set in a future where original ideas are pretty sparse - the only reason that grenade is the holy hand grenade is because recognition among the players is a way to give it significance.

dwhfxr1,"Yeah it felt really weird that nobody has found a key in 4 years, but then Wade comes along and finds all three in two days.",87yv63
dwj2onl,"As someone who *hasn't* read the books I quite liked the way they approached time. They spelled out pretty clearly how there had been massive interest at first but after 5 years it had died down to only the dedicated few. Once the first key was found then everything became a race against time. I think in a movie that sort of time pressure helps to explain why characters don't have the sort of ongoing debates and strategy meetings that film can't really afford too much time for. 

They did the same thing with LOTRs. ""I don't have any answers Frodo"" isn't really a line that could be delivered if Frodo had the ring for 20 years.",87yv63
dwipnqz,"It was weirder to me that everything hadn't been cracked in the first week. I've seen the internet solve some crazy random shit, like fuckin 4chan figuring out where Shia had hid a flag in the middle of nowhere in a handful of days. With millions of people digging through all that data... damn, that first solution would've been waaaay too obvious once people found that memory clip.

And I actually liked her response to his confession. Dude was the epitome of ""that guy"" falling over himself for digital booty, basically. It was waaaay too damn real, and I've seen it actually happen to guys I know with girls in real life. They have a romanticized view of the world, and it's really just super creepy and sad. Her telling him off was just so right... but yeah, having them otherwise instantly hook up IRL kinda ruined that, especially since his Aunt just blew up.",87yv63
dwiqi68,Furthermore it was the kind of movie that could easily had had a cheesy montage to represent the passing of time.,87yv63
dwm8200,"Plus in the book everyone thought the egg hunt was a ruse because nobody found it in years. The first key was hidden on a school planet that nobody would ever think to look. Wade couldnt get off this planet and he knew where to find the key but it still took him a month to farm and get shitty gear to go get it. Once he did get the key, it felt much more exciting because everyone realized that the contest is real.

Compared to the movie where everyone knows where the key is, but can't get to it. Once he does get the key it doesn't carry that same triumph.",87yv63
dwidpq8,I had the same observation. Those chunks of time when none of the main characters were talking because they were all trying to figure it out themselves really hammered in that feeling of isolation. Like in real life when you're sitting alone when none of your online friends are online. ,87yv63
dwy3cqa,"Ya I couldn't agree more. *book spoilers ahead*

 While the movie was definitely entertaining, it fell short in a number of ways. There was sometimes a much darker tone in the book. The feeling of loneliness, isolation, and the lack of any real purpose outside of Oasis were themes the book conveyed very well. There was one scene in the book were if Wade would in die in the Oasis, his only real option would be to go to the roof of his apartment after dispersing his inventory to under privileged kids and jump off to his death. In the book, this really seemed like the logical step. 

Also the building of the Art3mis relationship seemed to like the true arc of the book. There were multiple parts where finding Halliday's egg just didn't seem important, that he would gladly give it all up just to be with her. This built up through the entire story and the gravity of defeating isolation of an entire lifetime spent in virtual reality was was conveyed very well. For me, the entire book built up to the two of them meeting in real life. The weight of that moment was so much and I felt everything else go away besides that and I was rooting for it more than any of the High 5 winning the competition. I thought it was a real disservice to have those 2 be revealed to each other in the movie like 30 minutes in. 

You see this movie for the Spielberg visuals and directing but definately I recommend the book as it illuminates so much more to this story. ",87yv63
dwmly3i,"Ohhh, okay. That's exactly what bothered me. I might have to read the book then.",87yv63
dwj3ywv,Yeah that was my main complaint too. Everything happened way too fast! I understand it’s a movie and it has to be condensed etc. but they could have at least given us a montage of Wade researching or something. ,87yv63
dwne29i,Yeah. It felt really fast. I was looking forward to him going to school for 5 minutes at least. I honestly would have been okay with splitting the movie in two parts.  ,87yv63
dwrlcnv,I think the writers vastly underestimate the gamer community. Nothing stays hidden in games for very long if at all. ,87yv63
dwkrpos,"I think the movie made more sense in this respect... if you have a company as large as IOI looking for control of the Oasis, then they're going to immediately go after whoever got the first key. They wouldn't wait around and miss their chance. I think it worked better over the span of a couple of days vs. months/years. But I do find it interesting that it took four years to find the first key... no one thought to drive around that track backwards? lol ",87yv63
dx9d6wx,"But that's also the least plausible thing in the film. It's a video game challenge. Gamers would have solved every challenge in maybe a day or two.

Narratively, I see what you mean.",87yv63
e2x86ha,Could have been a two part movie. Really wished it was closer to the book.,87yv63
dwkm9rz,That was my only complaint with the movie as well. Things just happened way too fast. ,87yv63
dwnq6dl,Yeah thats the only thing about movies is the sense of time is just too condensed. Unless it's a tv series or Edge of Tomorrow scenario :(,87yv63
dwkkl84,The book does the same thing,87yv63
dwrfqox,"Wade's aunt was killed? I thought it was his **mom's sister**?

Seriously though, in the book his aunt just keeps Wade around for his monthly food stamps, so he wasn't really sad to see her go. ",87yv63
dwkjnc8,"Yes. I really enjoyed the movie, but this was definitely awkward. Wade just had an attempt on his life, which missed him but killed his aunt. He was trying desperately to warn her and get to her, but failed--and nearly died himself in the process. Then it's immediately forgotten the next scene. Wade doesn't even mention his aunt's death until he's in Sorrento's ""office"" a good while later, and even then it was just as an intimidation tactic. None of the characters really acknowledge it happened at all. ",87yv63
dws0p2z,This is actually a fairly common trait of the orphan-hero stories. ,87yv63
dwnqbhy,Yeah it was definitely a Tattoine type of moment. He didn't seem that sad about it after meeting up with Samantha either!,87yv63
dwob5m1,"Yeah, I was very surprised, like this dude completely forgot his aunt just died and moved on way too soon.",87yv63
dx069sf,"I thought he would mention that IOI killed his aunt when he was announcing shit in the Oasis, adds a personal touch to it",87yv63
iot5vl0,i guess Spielberg knows that everyone will hate on Aunt Alice and Rick so he pretty much did everyone a favor to skip past,87yv63

That first key would've been found 2 hours after the challenge started. ",87yv63
dwj3wsv,"No one has found the first key during the first five years (point where they are at in the movie). Then Wade points out someone had recently figured out the location of the first key and that portal had opened to the race.  So, the portal/race was still relatively new to the avatars ",87yv63
dwig0mh,I thought the same thing.  People find insanely obscure Easter eggs in video games these days.  In real world. That driving back thing would have been realized within hours.  ,87yv63
dwixh6l,"Agreed and I felt the same way about the last key too. With one of the world's largest corporations with its own pop culture department, I'm surprised that the solution wasn't found within the first five attempts. As soon as the Atari 2600 was mentioned, I figured that the world's first Easter Egg would be making an appearance.",87yv63
dwio2ge,"I interpreted that as ""You have to drive at full speed backwards to unlock the gate."" Inching up won't cut it.

And nobody did that because that's assured death, and they lose everything they ever worked for.

Edit: And I'm downvoted for providing some logic... Listen this movie has problems but let's not start making shit up, shall we? We can be better than that and talk about real issues: Like the paper-thin romance, and how it made no sense for Artemis to want Wade to be the big hero guy.

> Reality is real. 

None of those people probably had any second thought about sacrificing their **avatar** because they could always respawn. But faced with a pissed off dude in a suit, who probably has nothing more to lose, they reacted with fear and self-preservation. 

Edit: As for the ""there's more of them so why not attack"" side of the argument. I think it's because those people know that this guy is Nolan Sorrento, head of IOI, and has already admitted to killing a stack of people to get what he wanted. He likely wouldn't hesitate to have the lot of them killed either. ",87yv63

He just walks through them with it pointed up in the air. ""Don't make a move!  I'll fire a warning shot into the air if you do!""  

I wrote it off as it being a ""PG"" movie, so they just couldn't have him dismembered by a mob or have him shoot people to prove his point.  Ergo, it was just illogical.",87yv63

dwmyduq,"I noticed that detail, but her reveal was the biggest problem I had with the movie! He says I love you, etc. then she says I look different, you don’t know me etc. Why did she have him chloroformed and kidnapped and brought to her? He wanted to meet her anyway. Then she’s actually cute and looks the same but has a slight birthmark, and is exactly who he thinks she is with no ulterior motives. It was pretty one dimensional, but guess the book was cliche so ",87yv63

dwgnaqs,"The film being in a hurry is my #1 complaint - there’s no good sense of time whatsoever. The whole movie seems to take place in what ... 36 hours? I know it’s longer than that, but there’s not any real indication of passing time. 

We meet Artemis, and then after the first puzzle it suddenly seems like they’re besties with pet names for one another. Oh and they’re also in love now. Even a narrated montage like “after that, we became THE HI FIVE. We were celebrities, but we spent most of our time in our basement hangout with [insert references here]” would’ve been helpful. 

Instead, the movie just seemed to jump from point to point without showing how we got there. ",87yv63
dwgptnz,"Frankly, I would love to see a movie more in line with that whole Shining sequence. A story more about these characters hopping around into iconic pop culture locations and less about the dystopian fight the power type of stuff.

That was when the entire concept of this story really shined. Being able to play around with those iconic elements made it feel fresh and exciting. If they ever made a sequel to this I would hope they just make it less serious and more fun/adventurous. ",87yv63
dwgtvmk,"> Spielberg can still really command the eye in an action sequence though.

Pretty good movie overall and much better than I expected. ",87yv63

dwh33os,"In the narration towards the beginning he talks about how everyone just runs off into the oasis and don't even try to fix or solve things in the real world anymore. 

The rift between the two creators seemed to be over how addictive the oasis was. 

The movie didn't do as good of a job explaining how the world's economy revolves around the oasis as the book did. Instead everyone is just wearing headsets everywhere oblivious to the world around them and you see the aunt's asshole boyfriend blow all their money trying to strike it rich on doom world. 

When Wade meets AI Hallady at the end he seems profoundly sad because he dedicated so much of his life to escapism instead of his real life. 

In the movie's context them trying to get people to use the oasis less fits the story and feels like a happy ending.",87yv63
dwp8hr6,"That’s what annoyed me also. This teenager has like trillions of dollars, how about he used some of it to help people instead of shutting off the one good part of most people’s lives?",87yv63
dwijv42,He also closed 2 days of income from those who make extra money on the oasis. ,87yv63

dwnl5o4,"Not to mention that it would be the crux of some people's livelihoods, thus really throwing them under a bus. 

Also, Art3mis chastising him with 'this is the only world you've ever known' seemed stupid considering the fact that by that point it would be a case of 'well yeah, duh'. If VR had reached that level in society, then it would most definitely would be reality and nobody would still be asking that question. Not that I didn't enjoy the film (as I did), but that's where it really reminded me that it was middle aged guys writing this who hadn't grown up with the internet (as she sounded more like my parents than a twenty-something girl in the year 2044 raised on such technology).

This reminds me of how people reacted to Seb in La La Land in how he’s a white guy trying to “save jazz” - the movie lambasts him for that and he is not in anyway a sparkling hero. There’s even a scene in which John Legend’s character picks apart Seb’s entire viewpoint and the film proceeds to show how much of a single-minded dick he is.

All that information in one freaking shot.",87yv63

dwio0qe,"Eh,  I feel that camera movement is much less impressive in a CGI world. It looked cool but I had a hard time following the subject and action at times. Could have been fixed with a bit of coloring.

Edit: Not saying it's bad. Just saying... it's not as impressive as our brains make it out to be. It's like being impressed with the opening scene of Revenge of the Sith. Yes it's one long uncut shot... of an entirely CGI sequence. That control was in the creator's hands the entire time. It took some storyboarding and coding but that's about it.",87yv63

Its in the future man, think of how big corporations are now and their current trajectory, something like an IOI isn't completely impossible. The cops show up in the end because they realize that IOI is about to lose a lot of power and influence after losing, or since everyone in the world stood up to oppose them they feel they can do it now.",87yv63

dwma3oc,"Eh. It kinda bothered me but I think it's pretty simple. They weren't expecting a gun. With a gun, he can easily harm and kill at least a dozen of them.

dwk6y16,Kinda sucks they used the Halo 4 master chief model which is inferior to the previous mark 6 and also is unique only to the master chief because cortaba created it with nanobots while he was in stasis or something. So really it was a bunch of Master Chiefs and not a bunch of Spartans and that irks me,87yv63

dwjg4s6,"I agree, great adaptation hit all the big moments that would have been riot inducing if they left them out.

I was also glad they had the final game quest be truly ""You have to have to serious game knowledge to figure this one out""  with the adventure easter egg, because if nothing else that was called out in the first like, 2 or 3 pages of the book, but having every challenge be based on those older games would have 1) gotten old fast, 2) reaaaally lost a lot of the audience.

The only thing I was a little bummed they didn't *fully* incorporate was the ""playing the movie"" thing. the meticulous recreation of the Shining mansion was a great option, but I was hoping they would go with the ""act out the movie, and get more points for quoting it correctly, and saying it with the right inflection""...thing, if only so some VR studio would try it in some way too, in some limited form.",87yv63
dwmlmwn,"A lot of the changes they made really promoted the idea that while Wade was awesome, he couldn't do it alone. Giving Samantha more plot points helped balance things out to make this play out more like a heist film and less of a Mary Sue.

I also wanted IRok to pull his gear off in the real world.",87yv63

For example. The guy that jumped down as the Gundam, jumped out of a *modded out* Firefly-class vessel. In the first episode of the series, they use the ship to intimidate a bunch of bar brawlers, but Wash (or Mal?) points out they weren't looking very close, because as a transport vessel, it literally doesn't have any guns.

I've always thought studios learned the wrong lesson from Spielberg's films, just make a thrill ride flashy enough and you'll get your cash. But they failed to realize you need a skilled hand and passion among the chaos. In most other films, the race at the beginning should have been an incomprehensible mess. But in Spielberg's hands it sucks you right into the action to be amazed. He understands that even in a big budget event you still need a deft hand to guide the audience both in and out of the action. He's undoubtedly still got it.",87yv63
dwlxx0q,I don't feel this way about it. There was no reverence or awe to any of the characters. They're just sort of there. This is likely the only time we'll see (or re-see) most of those characters in a massive blockbuster and you get no moment to really soak them in. The Gundam and Chucky were the only real badass reveals that would have fans hyped. Giving some characters a quick spotlight in the races or fights would have been great. Maybe they couldn't do that because all the rights holders would fight over the screentime of their character. ,87yv63

dwk8624,"> This is fucking over 70 year old Steven Spielberg still treating us to something modern movies don't do enough of, which is that **beautiful feeling of childhood imagination.**

What really draws my ire is when film critics ***criticize him*** for intentionally framing/blocking scenes to invoke that sense of wonder out of people of all ages. 

This pretty much sums up the criticism against him

> infantilizing the audience, reconstituting the spectator as child, then overwhelming him and her with sound and spectacle, obliterating irony, aesthetic self-consciousness, and critical reflection

These criticisms are pretty much his strengths re-worded critically. 

Yeah, we get goosebumps when the Indiana Jones theme song plays as Indy saves the day. The shot of ET as a silhouette in the Moon makes everyone feel like a kid. Schindler’s List, Munich, Lincoln, Bridge of Spies, etc more than legitimize him as the most versatile director. And most impactful. 

HE PRETTY MUCH INVENTED THE USAGE OF THE CAMERA AS MORE THAN JUST INVISIBLE 4TH WALL BUT A TOOL TO MAKE THE AUDIENCE FEEL LIKE THEY’RE THERE. 

Alfred Hitchcock after watching Jaws:

> He's the first one of us who doesn't see the [proscenium arch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscenium)"".

That’s Hitchcock on a 28-year old Spielberg. 

You ever notice how most old films look like recordings of stage plays? Minimal camera movement. Characters facing the camera at 45 degree angles. No sense of actual 3D space or 4 real walls. Everyone is boxed in, even in outdoor shots. No closeups for emotion, no zooms for important scenes. Spielberg pioneered a lot of that. 

Imagine Jurassic Park with no close-ups (Grant and Ellie’s faces upon seeing the dinosaurs, or Grant asking “you bred raptors?”), no theme music (as we first see the dinosaurs), no tracking shots (of T-Rex chasing the Jeep), no clever blocking (the raptors in the kitchen with Timmy hiding), or framing (humans next to Dinos for scale), or use of silhouettes (raptor silhouette in the dining area of exhibit), or the tilt of the camera with the characters (Ellie standing up to see dinosaurs from Jeep). It’d be awful. 

Like in Jurassic Park, that build up to when Grant and Ellie see the dinosaurs for the first time, it’s intentional invocation of childlike wonderment. 

Even in Transformers 1 — inarguably the best or least bad of the franchise — **Spielberg consulted on the TWO most important scenes in the franchise, where Sam first “meets” BumbleBee, and when the rest of the Autobots arrive**. 

It’s also the first and last Transformers movie Spielberg actually gave so much as advice on. 

 It’s may still be Bay “copying” Spielberg, and we still get a bit of “Bayhem” with the frenetic editing — but it’s a huge reason why Transformers 1 was so well-received; it was a mediocre script that still managed to instill wonder in a lot of the audience because of the “Spielberg shots” and influence we sense through Sam’s teen character’s wonder and awe. 

The action shots are also a lot clearer than any of the other films. In both Transformers 1 clips below, they combine for about 8 minutes but you get 2 distinct narratives, and it’s clear what’s going on (contrasted with the Transformers 2 first 5 minutes at the bottom, where there are 20 different things going on). 

 [Here is Sam seeing Bumblebee for the first time that’s as Spielberg as it gets without him actually directing](https://youtu.be/q4LfeqyzIvI)

From 0:01 to 1:40 is absolutely Spielberg-influenced. If you want to skip to the part that mirrors Jurassic Park go to 1:18-1:27. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it mimics Spielberg.**^1**

Not quite as smooth because it’s Bay in the editing...room, with all the cuts, but definitely Spielberg-influenced.

**^1**

From the low-tracking shot following Sam riding his bike ([Catch Me if you Can 2:15-2:40](https://youtu.be/BaS-cSFLq8Y), Indiana Jones, Jaws, [Saving Private Ryan](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/spielberg-tracking-shot-example.gif)), to the match-cuts of BumbleBee and Sam getting into the yard (plenty of examples, [Minority Report](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/spielberg-match-cut.gif)), the Spielberg Closeup^tm and tilting up of Sam’s face as he sees BumbleBee in all his glory [many examples of “Spielberg Face”](http://www.cinelinx.com/images/Rated_GSP/Gilliam/spielberg-face-egai.jpg), to the near-blinding glowing light we see when “we” are behind Sam and trying to see BumbleBee from his view for the first time but all we see is a silhouette (of course, ET, Close Encounters with the kid approaching the door, AI, Minority Report (both Minority Report and AI have non-stop blinding lights), [Amblin](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spielberg-Silhouettes-LAvideoFilmmaker.com_.png), [Amistad](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spielberg-Silhouettes-LAvideoFilmmaker.com_.png), [Catch Me if you Can](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spielberg-Silhouettes-LAvideoFilmmaker.com_.png), [Munich](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spielberg-Silhouettes-LAvideoFilmmaker.com_.png)), the use of foreground characters or objects to frame the background, though he does it either to 1) give a sense of scale to the background or 2) insert clever symbolism by putting the background character or object into the frame (Jurassic Park, [Minority Report](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/spielberg-techniques-framing-foreground-objects-1.png), Munich, [AI](http://www.lavideofilmmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/spielberg-framing-through-circles.png)), and hand-held shots with frenetic movement (Minority Report, Catch Me if you Can). 

And of course, Spielberg is a master at the “oner” or single-shot — which Bay isn’t skilled enough to do. He also will use composite shots involving many of the above techniques. 

[The famous Jurassic Park clip where Grant and Ellie first see dinosaurs. It has just about all the elements. ](https://youtu.be/PJlmYh27MHg)

This scene is a good display of many types of his techniques. The closeup and tilt-up. Use of foreground. Switch from wide to long lenses. Framing characters. Use of light. 

[Here is the arrival of the Autobots, which is longer and Bay had more of his style, but you still see Spielberg’s influence. Just the mere fact that there aren’t cuts every 2-3 seconds show Bay’s restraint and deference to Spielberg](https://youtu.be/c3BlZWYGjBY)

It’s still got Bay’s nauseating “spinning” shots and explosions, but you’ll notice the Spielberg stuff. 

[Contrast it with the opening sequence of Transformers 2, widely held as one of the worst blockbuster films in the past decade. It’s hard to tell what the hell is going on. Full “Bayhem”](https://youtu.be/pF0ByDSKPl0)

I can fully understand why you'd love it. I rave about Super 8 and almost any Spielberg movie for those reasons. But it's a hard change from the source material, sometimes for the better and sometimes blatantly not. The references were simplified for audiences, the Oasis lost it's very foundation in MMO and D&D, and the bleak nature of the future was heavily softened while simplifying the enemy into a single character.

I get the instinct to change the first key from an obscure roleplaying game to something more exciting/cinematic like a exciting race, but in the book the most exciting part for me was when Parzival discovers the first gate/key is hidden on the school planet--accessible to literally anyone, with no gear or coins--and you see him go into this cave all by himself. It was so tense and exhilarating, being with him as you realize he is the only guy in the world to discover the key.

Forcing people to perform ""manual labor"" in the Oasis? What would those people be doing beyond setting up a huge mine field? How would they monetize that labor force?

dwmzgjt,"I've been saying from the very beginning that this movie should have been told in 3 parts. I get why that wasn't an option for them, but the world and story Cline created were obviously way too dense for a single movie, and the things you're mentioning are pretty much why. Wade has a lot of stream of consciousness narration which could have been shown to us without a voiceover, but that would have taken up a tremendous amount of screen time to get it all in. It becomes painfully obvious how hard they tried to cram as much in as possible if you've read the novel, and some of those things are explained only in tiny details if you watch the film closely enough. For instance, there's an IOI logo on the box when Wade orders his haptic suit, so yes. They make those.

Samantha's ""welcome to the rebellion"" line is, I believe, a nod to Star Wars, but I'm not a big fan of it myself. It's implicit of a plot thread that goes absolutely nowhere and was, in my opinion, completely unnecessary. Basically every one of your concerns is addressed in the novel, even with how different the two versions of the story are. But again, it all boils down to how much they had to condense the story to fit into two hours. 

Personally, I think the characters suffered the most in the transition. The movie is 2 hours 20 minutes long. At 2 hours 30 minutes, it still would have been a perfectly acceptable run time for a film of this scale and they could have used those extra ten minutes to make us actually care about the characters. Instead, everyone is a flat and one-dimensional version of themselves with the end result being that a lot of defining characteristics and moments that made us care about these characters in the first place are completely lost in translation. Daito and Sho(to) get hit pretty hard with Spielberg's condenser cannon, but the worst offendor, in my opinion, is hands down the relationship between Parzival and Artemis, which I think was critical to some themes in the story. In the novel, it at least felt organic and somewhat relatable. In the film, he meets her twice before telling her he's in love with her, and you just barely get a sense of how he knows who she is in the first place or why she's ""famous"". They have very little chemistry, and are given almost no room to breathe and no screen time to develop any. 

Overall, I was satisfied with the film, but I can't help but feel sorry for anyone who didn't read the book, because there's so much that just isn't there and the characters, more than anything else, really suffer because of that.

Additionally, there were other planets and places, including night clubs, in oasis that were safe, but the one they attended was notoriously NOT a safe zone.

Another aspect of the game worth mentioning is that travel was expensive. The game according to the movie had been less monetized than the one portrayed in the book. Basically all the cool shit was expensive. Wade definitely wouldn’t  have been able to afford a Delorean at the beginning.",87yv63

Spielberg later found the book and removed it.   
The only exceptions Spielberg made were Back to the Future, Jurassic Park (a quick shot of the T-rex), and Gremlins - the latter of which was actually snuck into the movie during post production by the animators.

dx9230b,"> I've heard the book is kind of cringy and bad

The book is told from the perspective of a teenage boy, and it doesn't try to downplay his immaturity or social ineptness. He's not a Holden Caulfield (nor is Ernest Cline a J.D. Salinger) but he's along those lines of a character you're not necessarily supposed to like or relate to. The book isn't a celebration of nostalgia, it's an immersion in *geekdom* and being a teenager. I think a lot of people who read the book don't understand that and instead expected just a bunch of pop culture references.

The book could easily have been much deeper with actual social commentary and some plot elements that, as an experienced reader, I felt were heavily foreshadowed but never came to pass.  It's possible that the sequel will resolve these things, but it's really kind of a popcorn book when taken by itself.  It just feels... incomplete.

That birthmark was enough for the character in this movie. Its not that it makes her ugly, its that you notice it before you realize she is pretty. When it comes to body image society has imposed all sorts of standards we will debate as long as we exist. But a flaw, be it a birthmark, scar, or any other deformity, is more noticeable to our subconcious mind than an unfortunate variety of body or facial attributes which still fall within the range of normality.

dwm2hhw,"> The High 5 all living in the same city was way too convenient. I also didn't like how quick they were to work together or how Aech was already buds with Daisho.

I'm pretty sure Aech said she lived in her mother's basement in Detroit? Which confused me since it seemed like Art3mis made a phone call and suddenly they're all right outside the hideout in a van ready to go.

BTW - the whole driving around in a van geared up and making speeches to everybody while the antagonists track them down was straight out of *Pump Up The Volume*.",87yv63

dx4ccpz,"You might like a chinese novel called ""Terror Infinity"". It's basically ""You're now in a horror movie, do your best to survive and you'll get super powers and weapons later!.""

The plot does sadly get a bit more silly as it goes on and there's some really cringy instances of writing... but it does have some fun stuff.

Like for example, in the novel the difficulty of a movie is raised based on the number of people participating. So when 20 people enter ""Alien 1"" instead of 1 xenomorph, there's NINE.",87yv63
dyc4y98,"The plot of the book spends a lot of time making sense of the 80's fascination.  Halliday grew up in the 80's, he had an obsession with the time period and also with stopping time and reverting to the place he felt he belonged, so it's no surprise the hunt was focused on the music, TV shows, and games he liked the best.  The movie did a horrible job of relating all of that to you the viewer, though.",87yv63
dwlq7g2,"> since I forgot this is a spoiler zone, it was the Gundam scene.

dxhzhby,"I agree, never got slow. BUt IMO, the whole parzival art3mis falliung in love was waaayyy too rushed...",87yv63
e0f2ow1,God I felt the pacing was one of the worst parts. They mention in passing that the easter egg hunt had started years ago and that they had been trying to beat the race that entire time. Then they beat it and it feels like the rest of the hunt in a weekend. The book really shows how hard the hunt was as it would take months or even over a year to solve the clue to get to the next challenge.,87yv63
dyc4s6t,"I saw it yesterday and was extremely disappointed.  There were so many changes that just didn't need to change.  To me, it destroyed about half of the geek culture that the book spent so much time building up around the main characters.  I identified more with the sixer scholars arguing over video games than the actual leads.  I hated the repackaging of Art3mis [as an outgoing rebel leader with a mid-film in-person rescue of Parzival](#spoiler).  There were just so many inconsistencies with the book I couldn't handle it.  I tried so hard to remove the book from my mind and just watch a movie with a similar premise, but I couldn't push it out of my mind.",87yv63

Just left me disappointed.",87yv63
dyqb5h9,I think I need to go re-read the book after watching this ,87yv63

e399y69,"And the people running through the streets with VR headsets this is worse than Pokemon go, I wonder how many people got run over by cars because of that. Also in the beginning of the movie it showed a person jump over a couch, and in VR the avatar jumped over something as well, it's so stupid, in the book I expected people to either have a treadmill-like stationary holder similar to  IOI's in the movie but a little different (there is a company that makes them, forgot the name), or sit in a chair and only have hand and head tracking while moving legs somehow (this can add restraints in-game for what else you can do with your legs) I thought of the controllers looking like the power glove and work kind of like those golden gloves in that regular show episode (buttons inside the gloves but also able to move fingers)",87yv63
e0hp79m,"Excellent visuals. 

The pop culture references were way too forced. Take out the nostalgia (which would have been great, but it just came off like you said - ""hello fellow kids"") and it's just a nice looking movie with a mediocre story. 

I was entertained. I'll buy it on Blu-ray. But, the way they put in all the references came off as too cringey. I get why, as the creator of the Oasis was big into that stuff. So am I.

dwi2o0c,"Considering the insane difficulty level of the course - no IOI staff make it in the run-through we see - it seems plausible that nobody wants to be goofing around on company time until they've proven themselves good enough to finish the race.

e3uxb7r,"Luke’s aunt and uncle advances the plot. I watched RP1 for my first time yesterday and I can’t remember Wade’s mourning scene. His aunt felt like a misfired attempt to raise the stakes. It succeeds in establishing Nolan’s goons are after Wade in the real world but it certainly didn’t translate to me as Wade’s resolve being strengthened. Nor was there anything going on to suggest Wade needed further resolve.

Wade’s mentioning her at the end is the biggest problem with it all. Because like you said, I’m rationalizing off as, “I guess he really didn’t care about her. He does live his life in a videogame.” But then he claims otherwise and it feels completely undeserved.",87yv63

dxkx5dr,"I've been thinking about that too, much of the film feels like it's aimed at mid/late teens... but the references are geared towards those in their 30s/40s. In theory it might have crossover appeal for parents who grew up in the 80s to watch with their children (similar to how Halliday passes on his 80s nostalgia via the Oasis) but some of the more mature content might put them off. I was surprised with how much they got away with for low rating (12A in the UK) especially in The Shining sequence.

I also found the messages a bit muddled, and weirdly for a plot which hinges on people having obsessively detailed knowledge of specific pop culture things they love... the film itself doesn't really hold up to (or warrant) that level of scrutiny. I can see a lot of people liking it for the adrenaline rush it offers, but are many people going to *love* it?",87yv63

dwgms9j,The movie is strange. It has a lot of 10/10 moments. Its visually stunning and interesting but it feels long. Also the acting is a bit all over the place. Everything in the oasis is AMAZING and 50% of the things outside of it are just okay. It's a 7/10 with a ton of 10/10 moments. The third act is the weakest part of the movie for sure and the romance doesn't work at all. ,87yv63
dwgmd0q,Fucking loved it,87yv63
dwgmxlg,"I haaaated the book and thought the movie was good. The dialogue was awful imo but everything else ranged from fine to excellent (the action is the standout, acting was mostly really solid).

Don't want to spoil anything but there's a Kubrick-inspired scene that is my favorite part of the movie. Very creative stuff there.

I do think the references got pretty annoying at times, but as the movie went on it got better. Overall it was enjoyable and a massive improvement over the book. 7/10 for me.

Also my wife had no interest in seeing this and she loved it. Like wants to watch it again immediately. ",87yv63
dwgmjgc,"It's all subjective, but for me it's like a low 7/10. Felt overstuffed, with some sappy stuff at the end. I wanted it to end about 10-20 minutes earlier, as they really drag out the suspense. 

That being said, there was a lot of applause in my theater. A lot of people seemed to enjoy it. ",87yv63
dwlch73,"I just saw it. I’m a 30 year old man who has never read the books but likes a lot of the geek culture it is built around. I came very close to hating it. It was so poorly written, the pacing was terrible, the characters were horribly cliched, the motivations were superficial at best and nonsensical at worst.

There was redeeming features - it looked great visually, it has some scenes where even the most stone hearted viewers will find themselves geeking out on the edge of their seat, and it seemed to have more heart behind its pop culture references than Reddit convinced me the book has.

Overall I’d say it was a high 5 or low 6 out of 10. Not the worst film you’ll see this year, but a pretty low blip on Spielberg’s resume.",87yv63
dwi5bo0,No,87yv63

Movie was good though. Very entertaining and really well done visually.",87yv63
dwivf6t,"The visuals in the OASIS are great and spotting the references is fun but the start has way too much exposition, didn't like most of the characters (except TJ Miller's and Halliday) the plot is corny and the ending is stupid (I'll keep it vague due to spoilers but no one challenging a guy in a crowd, and posters and confetti??). The love story is very cringy also. 6/10 for me so I was disappointed. It was however, a lot better than the book and at least my teenage step son loved it so it wasn't a total waste of a trip to the movies. ",87yv63
dwi169s,I fucking hated it. The story is even worse then the book. The love story is a typical kids movie love story. The villans are both totally incompetent and all knowing. They act so stupid that I don't know how they can be a thread. There is no Charakter development. The cgi and 3D especially in the first 30(?) min is bla. I likes a few scenes really. But if you are the kind of person which see his *favorite movie/anime/game * Charakter and is sold then it's the right one for you. ,87yv63
dwgn3rz,"I never read the book.  As for the movie it reminded me of Avatar in more ways than one (mostly in the final act) but was a faster paced and packed to the gills with so many odd bits and details it's maybe worth a second view.  

The issue really is wanting to see it again and honestly, I don't want to.  Not because the movie is bad but it felt like being on the most insane ride and it ends so completely.  Like the game over of all game overs, after one sitting I was content, yet knowing all of the tiny details that exist that I know I missed isn't enough for a second watch.

All and all, it's a fun ride.",87yv63

dwgmls6,Honestly so many people *wanted* to hate this movie which is a real shame. The movie is really good! It has it's flaws like any other movie but it's insanely entertaining and creative and it absolutely elevates the source material to a new height. ,87yv63

dwgmmvj,"Just got home from the theater, and... Holy. Shit. It was incredible. I know I may have that ""post-coitus lust"" about me right now, but it blew me away. The CGI was phenomenal. I haven't read the book, and I plan to, I just haven't yet, but the story was really well done, too.

dwuq3oy,"Compared to the book, it's almost stunning how good it is compared to how fucking terrible the book is.

Compared to other Spielberg movies, it's better than most of his recent stuff but worse than most of his classics.

It was a lot of fun overall, it's the kind of popcorn entertainment you don't feel guilty about afterwards.",87yv63
dwgme0t,"Definitely worth seeing. I am a big fan of the book but the movie definitely stands well on its own. The differences from the book I feel were almost the coolest parts of the movie. However, I felt like since I knew a lot of the characters and their personalities not shown in the movie but already in my head it may make some of the plot points and character choices rather confusing. 

This movie was marketed as a big pop culture blast where you see everything from the 80s. While that is true, they are mostly just visual effects that don't add to the plot. (To an extent some of the 80s pop culture is involved in the plot) The plot is solid on it's own and gives a lot of social commentary about our world today and how we identify as gamers and non gamers, as well as the whole debate over the free net.",87yv63
dwgmnw4,"Never read the book, but I loved the trailers so much that I was going to see this movie no matter what any of the critics said about it. I was still surprised how much I ended up liking it, highly recommended.",87yv63

dwgnzzu,"It's a great time. Period. If you gave the movie a bad review, you set your blockbuster film standards too high. It's written pretty well, acted great and all the big action shit is amazing. And it doesn't lean too heavily on the references. People thought this was just gonna tug on our nostalgia and that's it, but the movie stands on its own. There are references, but they rarely smack you in the face with them. I just don't understand why a movie like this has a RT score like it does and Black Panther is damn near infallible. That's just a joke. Black Panther was not a better movie than this. I don't know what the agenda of critics is these days ( although I could probably make a guess ), but it's stupid that Black Panther is above 90% and this movie is below 80. In my eyes they're BARE MINIMUM of equal quality, and my opinion is RPO is better by a pretty decent margin. But I also don't have any agenda.",87yv63
dwgphyn,64 on Metacritic is good ?,87yv63

It took 5 years from the time it opened for someone to make it on the board, and then in the span of a couple of weeks (if that), it's over? The book was told over a much longer period of time, and while I appreciate almost every change they made in the movie, that's one that I disagree with.

Of course, that presents some difficult writing problems, but from a story perspective, it gave people time to get excited about the egg hunt, and then let it fade, so each victory was a new rush. It also gave a little bit of time for character development (whether or not you like Wade's development in the books, he underwent a huge change, whereas in the movie, he, um, he...hang on, I'll think of it...).

I didn't mind the pacing, but I understand why people felt like it was rushed.",87yv63

The book has way more nostalgia (enough for a 17 year old like me to feel it), I'm talking about walking through a dungeon from D&D (one of the first designs if I remember correctly) and the boss has to be defeated with a game of joust, kind of nostalgia (I don't want to spoil anything so I hope this is enough nostalgia if not I guess I'll just say Zork...

Somehow Art3mis was the only one that noticed Parzival driving backwards. When did IOI figure out the first key? How did they figure it out? Art3mis gets the Jade Key and then IOI is seen struggling in The Shining. Then they somehow got the Jade Key and are at the location of the Crystal Key. 

Art3mis is part of some kind of resistance apparently. She is never seen ""clanning"" up with anyone besides Parzival and the gang. What is this resistance doing? Cheering her on?

The movie did a fair job of expressing Wade's initial reaction to Art3mis. And there was a decent amount of dialogue reflecting on that - of course, a book can always go more in depth, and that's the strength of a book.

The plot changes were necessary imo. Who the fuck would want Wade to play Jousting for the very first key? In fact, who would then continue to watch a movie watching Wade pretend he's Matthew Broderick in War Games just to watch him repeat lines haphazardly from the movie? Borefest. 

If living in the stacks without your real parents, living with an aunt and her shitty boyfriends, and sleeping on top of a washing machine isn't bad, then I guess you must have it worse. 

The movie actually provided insightful, and needed, moments with IOI as the book never does this - in fact the book just makes them out to be more cliche of a villain than the movie does.

I liked that Samantha get's captured unwillingly. The book's version makes wade out to be some unbelievable hero that can outsmart an entire conglomerate. Eye-rolling. Instead, the movie shows that it's not about one person, but how a team can help each other - this supports the underlying theme of the movie that the Oasis and real life are not meant to be ""played"" alone. Having Wade do EVERYTHING would underplay the importance of teamwork.

It's also better that the characters already knew each other early on. It further strengthens the bonds of the characters - having Shoto die in the book at end really doesn't give any weight because we barely knew the guy (unless running on a couple quests together instantly makes you bffs). The movie doesn't have the time to spare to have Shoto and Daito go off on random adventures with Parzival, so again - there's the difference between books and movies.

dx04d84,"This gets brought up every time, the whole driving backwards thing.

Thing is, given the context of the movie, it kinda does make sense. This is a future where people don't have a whole lot to give for, they're kinda living a shitty life. Hell, Wade and many others are essentially living in the slums with Oasis being their only escape.

Within that escape, however, is their avatar: the one thing where they get to be the cool guy/girl and live out their fantasy. But what if they lost everything they've ever gotten for 5+ years? That'd be devastating. How many are going to risk losing everything by randomly deciding to drive backwards into a wall? And this isn't just, ""oh, let's hit it at... 10-15 mph"" backwards either, it's gunning it.

By all accounts, the method to win the key is simple: win the race (and avoid King Kong). There isn't much reason to try driving backwards. There may even be rules set in place that people figured needed to be followed.

Thing to consider: there are easter eggs in games that took years to find. One in Halo 3 took ~7 years, another in Final Fantasy 9 took ~14 years (though this one was more a secret side-quest that involves a series of kinda convoluted steps).

dwh4jly,"In the book, the aunt and her boyfriend are really abusive to Wade, taking all of his food vouchers and even taking away his notebook (which he found and repaired). So when they get killed, Wade does not really dwell on it that long, he is much more freaked out by the fact he almost got killed.

dwj0v2j,"I agree. I didn't really know how faithful it was going to be. 

I was initially disappointed with the race being the first key, but then I realised that the book wouldn't make a good movie. We didn't want to see Art3mis at school, him being able to zip between the ""chat room"" and where he really was wouldn't have translated well, the timeline was too long (months in the book if I remember correctly), and there's only so much time we can watch someone play a video game.

I did miss Og secretly watching, the Pac-Man for the extra life, Daito's death made the book version seem much more critical. I think the book better emphasised how hard it was.

Oh look, there's Robocop for no reason or context! The scene where the bad guys are playing an arcade machine was absolutely absurd.

To me it felt like they decided to throw a whole bunch of references in, but they were just thrown into the movie as opposed to being an essential part of Haliday’s Hunt in the book. 

For example, in the book, the characters have to have this vast knowledge of 80s culture in order to even have a chance of finding the first key/gate. But in the movie, all it takes is watching a YouTube clip of Haliday after some party to get the first clue. Then there’s just a bunch of random pop culture references thrown into the movie without any contextual reasoning. Sure, the Shining bit was interesting (except why zombies?), but it felt felt like the pop culture knowledge really wasn’t essential to the hunt in the movies… just fluff.  ",87yv63

dwnju5a,"You underestimate the thrill that comes with danger.


Remember the Oasis is large. You go to a brothel or participate in a war. 

So let's take the Haptic Feedback suit. I assume some use it for the pleasurable sensations. Others may find the pain makes the game feel more real. But of course none of this will kill you. The guy released a bomb but wasn't in any physical danger. Also If you don't want to feel the nutshot pain, don't wear those parts.

The Oasis is also like bitcoin. You can use in game coins in the real world. So if you are rich in the game, you are rich in the real world.

Tech wise? The Oasis have a strong diversity of gaming options with plenty of support. Another company can try to put out their own product but the Oasis is more popular. It's more profitable to support content in that game. You can see this in the rise of Nintendo/Sony/Microsoft and the failure of Atari/Sega/Commodore.

Pay to win element? Well again different games and all and it seems like the hunt for the egg gave rise to IOI's setup. To add the game does reward skill as well. 

We only see a small sample of the Oasis. I assume there really are safe zones but the places we see aren't it. 

There are private voice chats but they probably didn't turn those on.

IOI - This society is dependent on the Oasis. So it's going to be harder for people to find and alternative and may accept the ads. Or they won't.

Because of context and timing Ready Player one just happened to be a book/movie that transcended even Spielberg. Atleast to me.

Are you talking about human characters being bland ? Because that was a major plot point. That they were supposed to be bland normal people and their avatars cool.  I think alot of people can identify with the characters as real people and their decision to create the avatar they did.  

I actually think they did a great job of making the lead character feel completely like a normal person from beginning to end, which is sort of unique. At no point did he feel like he was a Peter Parker type where you're eventually thinking, ok this guy is a truely special bad ass. The whole point is it's normal people( or nerds) doing amazing things in a virtual reality world.

And then Ready Player One comes along and glorifies the Iron Giant as a warmachine. Talk about missing the point, goddamn. The Iron Giant deserved better than to be referenced like that.

K.I.T.T. and *Back to the Future* and *The Iron Giant* and that just sounds like a big mess. And again, the trailer follows that up with CGI scenes that also look like a big overindulgent mess.

Movies should *purposely* stray away from the books.  You already conceded that there are different requirements, but it's more than simply requirements...you can make a film functional if you just change the bare minimum.  But to make it good, you sorta have to change the vast majority.  Seriously.

Steven Spielburg isn't an amateur.  He knew what he was doing.  And that's okay.  

An adaptation of a book to movie should take 1. the general setting 2. the general personalities of the main characters 3. the main themes 4. the most important plot points in the broadest strokes.  5, the main ""gimmicks"" as it were (for example, with this movie, ""nostalgia"").  Anything else should be on the basis of whether the thing in the book will make the movie better, and most of the time it's no.

The movie did follow the book.  It was true to the characters and the themes.  Those are the *only* things you should expect.  Any movie you can come up with that alters from this film will likely be inferior to this film.  It's very, very hard to pace a film properly.  ",87yv63

Race wasn't there for 5 years. It's one of the first lines of the whole fucking movie. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH.

Also, ""speedrunners would find that shit in an hour"".

Here's the thing. You fuck up in speedrunning SP game today, reset, go on.

You fuck up over there?

No car, no fuel, no gold. Good fucking luck.

To drive backwards would make 0 sense whatsoever. Too much is at stake.

Jesus, did some people not pay attention at all?

This movie had tons of flaws and acting problems, but the things I see pointed out the most are almost entirely explained by the movie itself.

2) Artemis felt self conscious about it. She's in her early 20's. Point is a guy she likes, doesn't care about her face. Sorrento didn't become a non prick but he saw that he lost. Killing this kid is front of all these people will not go in his favor. I think a part of him knew what this was all about. He did try to pitch idea's but got ignored by the creator. 

Not every character needs to develop. The henchwoman sold her soul to get her position. She has no problems killing kids.

3) Yeah.....the texting was weird because then did all these people just hope a plane? I we supposed to assume they were local? I mean that is possible if that's how the spawning works.  

Some people probably did accidentally drive backwards but they did do it at full speed during the race and kept going. Most people would stop because they wrecked(and thus not trigger the path).

Yeah a lot of people haven't seen the Shining. The movie isn't interesting enough to them. It's also 2045. 

IOI - They were being rushed. Remember these people didn't really understand the creator of the game. I should note the IOI girl did figure it out but was too late. She figured out it was Adventure and then figured out it was the Easter egg in the game itself. It's people easy to use hindsight when you know the answer.

Resistance? Wade gave out him name and probably used the exact same clues IOI used to find him.

1) I thought the race scene was actually really cool with Kong, even though the ""trick to beat it"" was ridiculous.

Indentured servants on a ten minute break can just saunter up to the bosses office. Oh, and they install a release switch in the IOI ""play chambers"" so that indentured servants can easily escape. It's all very convenient. 

3) I don't mind them changing major plot points, but they changed the entire themes of the story and the resolution. All of the cleverness and puzzling, and Wade getting himself locked up with the IOI and then escaping. That stuff was clever!

I thought the relationship was perfect. 

>The little character development there was is completely inexplicable, for the most part. While one can argue Parzival grows as a character through the journey, Art3mis finally being comfortable with her birthmark because Parzival says he likes it? Sorrento magically becoming a non-prick at the end and tearing up at the sight of the egg? And those are the only characters that developed in any way - Sorrento's henchwoman never had any character, Shoto, Daito and Aech were done a huge disservice (and Aech and Shoto still nailed it IMO), and there simply weren't characters relevant to the plot beyond those ones.

There's no character development. Everyone already knows each other. We don't need to get entire segments made showing everyone's childhood or backstory. That's a waste of time. It's LIVE ACTION for a reason.

>Completely inexplicable plotholes. Art3mis texts Aech, Shoto and Daito and they immediately find Parzival minutes later in the alley?

The challenge is to get through a D&D dungeon and beat the lich wizard at a game of Joust. Then you get the key and the second clue. He runs into Artemis (who found the dungeon before him but hasn't been able to beat the Joust game) just after he beats Joust but lies and says he didn't beat it, but gives her a hint that allows her to beat it.
2. The second challenge involves him going to Halliday's childhood home and playing Dungeons of Daggorath, after which he has to reenact the entire War Games movie as one of the characters. He then gets the second key and the next clue. It's at this point that IOI bombs his house.
3. After IOI bombs his house, Wade moves into an apartment building where he has an amazing Oasis rig set up and never leaves his house, ordering all his food for delivery and installing the best security he can find.
4. The club scene is just about the same, but Og is the DJ and he stops Sorrento from killing Artemis and Wade. Wade still makes his confession to Artemis and she tells him to fuck off and never talk to her again. She blocks him.
5. Wade gets the extra life coin from playing a perfect game of Pacman, which he does while trying to find the next key.
6. Artemis gets the next key first, you have to play Zork. Aech gets it next and gives Wade a hint, Wade finishes just as IOI lands. Shoto and Daito were also in the process of getting the key, but Daito is killed in-game and IRL by IOI who has broken into his house. Even though he knows they're in his room, he tries to save Shoto in-game before they throw him out the window.
6. Shoto is Japanese in the book, but Chinese in the movie.
7. Wade intentionally imprisons himself at a loyalty center to gain access to the IOI network and steal info. He gives this info to Shoto, Aech, and Artemis.
8. Their safe haven is in Oregon with Og, not with Artemis or Aech.
10. Wade himself fights Mechagodzilla as Ultraman. Everyone who got the second (or third?) key got to pick a mech of their choice.
11. Other references involved in the challenges including Rush, Blade Runner, Black Tiger, and Tempest.
12. The ""high 5"" kids are extremely reluctant to work together; Shoto only agrees to help after Daito is killed. Except for the final challenge, they all did everything alone with only occasional hints from each other.",87yv63

Wade was not only being abused by both his aunt and her boyfriend but the apartment was being shared like a refugee camp.

dwnm1ww,He changed the competitions which is a big one. There were too many changes to really list off but that was a big one. Like for the second key the were in the movie War Games and had to act out the entire movie perfectly. They also went to school in the Oasis which was a factor I expected to be in the movie. They found the first gate on the planet of the school and it was like a dungeon style cave you had to make it through. He also got the extra life from beating halidays high score in a Easter egg pac man machine. Oh and it was him that went to the loyality cells in the book.,87yv63

If he let Wade live, the most he would be charged with is an accessory to murder for the attack on the stacks (if F'Nale Zandor ratted on him) and his lawyers could probably have plea-bargained that down to something tolerable.

The fight against Sixers wasn't really a rebellion until the very end, and if their was a rebellion the high five had nothing to do with it.  Artemis wasn't even sure of Z's plan anyways when he told Shoto, Aech, and her the email he was going to send out to the entire Oasis.

dwhk2vq,"I mean, she calls him out immediately for saying it too soon and how she’s putting on a front in the Oasis. I’d say that’s pretty counter MPDG. The movie is explicitly not endorsing the behavior or romanticizing it.

This reminds me of how people reacted to Seb in La La Land in how he’s a white guy trying to “save jazz” - the movie lambasts him for that and he is not in anyway a sparkling hero. There’s even a scene in which John Legend’s character picks apart Seb’s entire viewpoint and the film proceeds to show how much of a single-minded dick he is.

Eh, Cline mentions it in passing that it brought the 80's back as a fad for a while, but he never really bothers to suggest the world of 2044+ has a culture of its own. 

Outside of the services Wade uses either to get into the Oasis (""rigs"" and the like) or while connected to it (along with a few things like buying a gun out of a vending machine) you have very little idea of the outside world, and inside Oasis it's just a nonstop barrage of 80's references (and occasionally things from the 70's, 90's, and even the aughts that apparently Cline just thought were cool even if Halliday didn't grow up with them.)

It's a bit of a Pokemon world, where characters rarely say or do anything that isn't tied back to the central premise. And if I'm being honest, the author can't even be bothered to supply THOSE details in a lot of cases, relying on the reader to guess what he means when he just describes things as being 80's haircuts, dance moves, or clothing. Deep world building is not his forte.

> Cline's second book is nothing but people quoting references every two seconds and it's dumb.

The first book REALLY isn't that different when it comes down to it. Cline barely uses the real world for anything more than item shops for Wade to acquire things at. Oasis in turn is mostly used quoting 80's media. 

There's hints of a bigger world early on, but it's never explored in any great detail. A post-apocalyptic society that's dependent on a virtual world to make it through the day would be an interesting story, but RP1 is mostly about listing things Cline remembers from his childhood. There's pages of stuff about crappy 80's sitcoms that don't even factor into the contest at all. I'm guessing the movie doesn't have a long inner monologue about Family Ties.

Not once do we see people pulling out smart phones or using computers to access online messaging forums. For all we know, reddit (and whatever forums in that world) weren't as widespread or used or got shut down; that is, something happened to the point where they simply weren't a resource these gamers utilized.

Important point though: gamers in the Oasis were largely in it for themselves. Yeah, they had clans/guilds, but as someone else has mentioned, driving backwards at full speed runs the risk of losing everything you've got. For the dedicated players, this loss isn't to be taken lightly, not when the virtual world is essentially all they have in life.

In another post, you mention people trying to find alternate routes. Yeah, but alternate routes that are en route to the finish line. What happens when you try driving backwards in Mario Kart or Horza or whatever racer today? You get warnings that you're going backwards and you never win. Everyone (in Oasis) thinks to follow the rules (ignoring that Halliway didn't like such things).

Consider this: there have been secrets in games that, even with the internet, weren't found for a long time. Halo 3 came out in 2007 and apparently there was a secret that wasn't discovered until ~2014, 7 years later! Apparently there's even a secret sidequest in Final Fantasy 9 that wasn't found until 13 years after it came out too.

You have this whole race course which is probably the size of all of New York and you can probably explore everywhere in it which I’m sure that would be the focus.

No? I see this brought up time and time again. If it's Mario Kart, the first thing I'd try is the speed boost trick during the countdown. Why would going backwards be the first thing someone would try? Not to mention, racing games today are on a continuous looping track, so going backwards just results in them driving the course in reverse with a warning popping up telling them so.

When Oasis is seemingly all these players have/value in life, it isn't likely going to be something they're going to throw away to test a hunch.

As standalone movie, it is pretty nice. But it does not do good job at adapting the book, the ideas and the characters.

It simply needs to be viewed as something unrelated to be book except in the most bare places.

I think my two biggest gripes are:

* Complete misunderstanding of what the OASIS evolved to in the books, place where you can pretty much live out your entire life, go to school, work, etc. The movie just makes it feel like just a video game that people are addicted to. (this gripe is also why I absolutely hated the end decision by Wade)
* Complete lack of feeling of tension and high stakes, mostly because IOI characters are very much there for comic relief, and the movie does not show how far are they willing to go to to achieve victory in the contest (including murder).

But now that you mentioned it, the knowledge required to complete the challenges is also very different, needing to know Halliday the man, instead of what his lifelong obsession was (however, in general, the movie pretty much skips over why would people in 2040s be obsessed with 1980s), which makes him seem like really self-absorbed asshat, instead of someone who wanted to share his love/obsession with the world.

I know you can't expect the movie to be as detailed as the book because it'd be way too long, but the whole thing just felt a bit rushed.

I found that to be too hamfisted of a joke in a movie of one hamfisted joke after another.  

Then I watch the Spielberg-directed Ready Player One and it has literally that same plot point except here it isn't a one-off joke, but framed as serious character development.

This, this is the one that really bugs me.

Somehow I think Halliday was smart enough to not allow this to happen. ~~He only built, y'know, the entire OASIS~~ The OASIS is a MMOG like any other - the only people with ""cheats"" (builtin ways to do things outside of normal play) are Gregarious employees if anyone, although I can also see there being nobody with this power except Halliday (dead) or the winner (who inherits Halliday's status as administrator of the OASIS and CEO of G.G.)

As for hacking it (causing the system to perform actions it shouldn't by gaining illegitimate access or other means outside the game proper), I know that in the book at least there were real-world big business deals happening in the OASIS so I imagine it's a relatively secure system. Beyond that, that's like saying ""why don't people just hack EVE to get the giant thousand dollar internet spaceships"" or ""why don't people just hack reddit to get unlimited gold"" or ""why don't people just hack Facebook to delete their private data"". Possible? Probably. Have people attempted it? Almost certainly (who wouldn't?) Have people made enough advance to keep enough force at it? Apparently not.

I was actually hoping that the girl wouldn't actually be the love interest in real life, and that his brutish ""best friend"" would turn out to be the one he fell for IRL, but there were no such reversals.

Also, it shows that there isn't supposed to be any AI in their future world, or any NPCs in the game, that when he meets a cute girl in the game, he is warned that she might be a guy in real life, but not that she might be a bot.  And it's not clear how the now-dead game creator exists in the game after he says he's not an avatar.

The ""future world"" didn't feel very coherent to me. I mean, the main idea was a lot like other distopian sci-fi, and it had some nice imagery, but the details didn't mesh.

They still had recognizable bags of Doritos(TM) in their trailers and Pizza Hut(TM) Pizza that was delivered by drone -- who made all that food for the people who didn't have money and didn't work? And who exactly were the people who were in the ""resistance"" who drugged and kidnapped Wade to get him to join them -- if they were big on growing food and fighting big companies, why did they focus most of their time on playing this game trying to join millions in searching for undiscovered Easter Eggs? What was 'plan B' for them if that was a wild goose chase? And why no self-driving cars, even when the people desperately need to do things other than drive? And why were they all so fixated on 70's and 80's pop culture, to the exclusion of pop culture from decades after that?

Consider that he's the Curator. Are you counting those scenes? If you don't count OASIS avatar scenes then the main characters are absent for most of the movie.

That's their MO, and practically everyone owes money to someone.

The first key seemed laughably easy compared to those laid out in the book, the second key could have been so much cooler than jump to the girl in the Kubric zombie setting. They also blew the reveal about Halliday's hidden love too early in my opinion.  Love they brought some modern pop culture into it too.

I too felt totally cheated of getting to experience Wade's actual rise to stardom from absolutely nothing. They sort of try to show it in the movie by him getting scraps off the other cars but it's like he starts out with a custom avatar, his car, and in the first scene he gets closer than any other racer to finishing... It for sure didn't have the same impact of him using his brain to figure out that the first key was so close to him while he was stuck on the school world. Him getting the each key in the book was so much more satisfying.  

I've heard a lot of people say: ""how could you make the original challenges interesting to watch?"" Here's an idea: spend all your action scene budget to have the people get sucked into the arcade game and play through a live action, futuristic version of Joust or whatever... I'd have been fine with something like that.  

Also the movie did not portray the actual ""detective"" work done to find the keys and pass the tests. He went to a hall and essentially found a keyphrase that said ""drive backwards"". Later in the movie he goes back to the Journals building and uses a keyword search for the girl he didn't kiss using her name, so this means you can keyword search anything said in that archive. If the first challenge was a race, you'd think any gunter would just go in and search every single keyword and phrase regarding races (since that challenge was the first one and no one had beat it for years).  

I'm happy for people that had fun watching it, because that's what it's all about and I'm not trying to prioritize my critical opinion over anyone's fun time because that's not cool either. But I've noticed that any person's criticism of this movie gets blasted with downvotes and hate. I do suspect a primary reason for that is the ""how dare you criticize any movie with my favorite... blah blah blah"" Yes... every single pop culture icon and hero is in there and I think if the movie happened to include your favorite stuff on the screen your more likely to support it. I was amped about the Akira bike, and the video game characters, and the fun reminders of all the things a I love, but an image collage was not enough to get me past all the changes they made to the story presented in the book.

His mother, Loretta, held two full-time positions within the OASIS. She worked as a telemarketer by day, and as a virtual escort by night. It is explained by Wade, that Loretta used the OASIS to babysit him during these work hours; he would play interactive games and learn fundamental skills within the virtual world, beginning his infatuation with technology at a young age.

When Wade was around 11 years old, Loretta died due to her drug addiction. She ""shot a bad batch of something into her arm,"" and Wade found her, listening to music on an MP3 player. After her death, he was forced to live with his aunt Alice and her often abusive boyfriends, including others who rented rooms in his aunt's double-wide trailer. Wade's aunt didn't actually take care of him; the only reason she agreed to take him in was to receive additional food vouchers.

Always watch a movie on its own terms, apart from the source material. If it’s a good movie, it’s a good movie. 

Following the source material too closely can also lead to failure cinematically (Dune’s “inner dialogs” for example, and I wouldn’t even be INTERESTED in a faithful adaptation of Dracula’s journal-entry storyline). Even when the source material is horribly butchered (for example the recent seasons of my favorite show, The Walking Dead), the failure of the adaptation is typically not caused solely by the divergence from the source material, but simply because the people adapting it just aren’t very good (Scott Gimple, aka “the man who killed Carl”)

Spielberg knows how to make a damn movie - but more importantly, he knows WHY to make a movie, and why people want to SEE movies. If you can’t trust him to adapt some “sacred” source material, who CAN you trust? Cecil Von Unpalatable, that director who makes movies no regular people enjoy?",87yv63

The take-away of it for me was that people (or at least, the main characters like Wade, Samantha, Helen, Nolan Sorrento, etc.) only just wanted to be “better” (at least, what they saw as better) and idealized versions of themselves.

I did not read the book, but I’m fairly certain this is the point of this coded sequence in the Oasis of Halliday and his younger self: It’s that childlike wonder for games and imagination that persevered into adulthood which ultimately laid the foundation for him creating the Oasis. The same idea is passed around with artists stating that “their inner child never went away” or “they never grew up”. That is, in my mind, the entire point of him and his younger self existing in this room that was basically their entire existence growing up.

On the other hand, I think there is something that the movie lost, and that's the journey. RP1 has a rather predictable story- sure, it's buried in videogame and movie references, but if you strip that away, it's just another tale of the underdog vs the big corporate bad, and that applies to the book and the movie. But what made the book fun was the journey, the world building, everything like that. MINORISH BOOK SPOILERS: [The planet with the arcades and pizza places where he plays to beat Pacman on a single quarter and gets the extra life quarter. The time he loses hope and starts hanging out in e-brothels, fucking a futuristic sex doll until he decides to throw it out and quit cold turkey. His whole time in the apartment, or when said apartment gets raided and he buys a gun and plays from an internet cafe.](#spoiler)

This doesn't make the movie bad, but it leaves a lot of glaring flaws. Most notably, the pacing. The entire movie spans ~2 days, while the book took like 1 and half **years** if I remember correctly. It leads to weird and utterly confusing moments in the movie like when Wade confesses his love to Artemis on their first ""date"". In the book, Wade was at first very cautious around her, and slowly starts to develop a hard teen crush on her. They even date for a while. Other things like in the movie Wade kinda forgets that his aunt was murdered along with a whole bunch of his neighbours, and the Dito-Sho/Shoto being just two Japanese stereotypes (I must also concede that the book was no better, but the development in the book is much better than in the movie with Dito being killed by IOI and finding out Dito and Shoto were not at all related) with no depth makes this movie not the most honest adaptation.

Yes, this so much. Compare this movie to Transformers 3 in 3D for example, the last movie my friend and I watched together in IMAX 3D. T3's action scenes were mostly a chaotic mess and gave my friend a headache, whereas he had a much better experience with this movie in IMAX 3D, which admittedly is probably due to advances in 3D cinema since 2011, but I think Spielberg's direction had a bigger impact.",87yv63

dwi80tn,"I read the book also and find the differences between the two very fascinating. While Spielberg had to have been very passionate about the material to make the movie, we now know his personal interest came from a different place in the book than where most readers were invested in. After that initial realization had worn off that this wouldn't be like the book, I honestly don't miss any of those things you mentioned. They're fun to read about, but I don't know why we'd need to know about the Oasis's foundation in MMO and D&D, or that we needed anymore references to make the movie more enjoyable. Also thought Sorento was handled great and combining characters happens in every adaptation.",87yv63
dwiigac,"Ernest Cline, the author of the book, was a co-producer of the movie and wrote most of the script. The changes were intentional by the author himself. Yes, it veered off in vastly different ways than the book, but it still kept to the spirit of the book. 

The changes made sense too given the medium it was made for. There just wasn't enough time for all worlds and month long puzzle solving shown in the book. Action movies benefit from fast pacing, which would get sullied by the book's pacing which was inherantly slower and more drawn out. The movie decided that instead of massively condensing down *all* of the book's scenes, they would just do totally different scenes which were naturally shorter and had the same effect to get the same outcome. This let them keep to the spirit of the book's plot without totally rushing through every single scene.",87yv63

dwilp53,"If I understand correctly it sounds like you think a change in Cinematographer could help Spielberg get back to that old style. Janusz Kaminski has shot every one of his films since Schindler's List and personally I hope it stays that way for eternity. Yes, it's different than his earlier work but also super dynamic and interesting. As you say, what we got was fantastic and beautiful. Though I don't see how it lacked grit at all. Blockbusters these days are incredible glossy and artificial. Ready Player One had a gorgeous & gritty dose of grain, and the set design particularly in the real world was pretty darn bleak. Unless you mean grit as ""real"", but the subject matter here doesn't really allow it to be done any other way.",87yv63

They also had no desire to escape from the real world (as opposed to Wade, and most of the other characters), so why change up their appearance and make it look less real? ",87yv63

dwhv2z1,"Copying shots counts as recreating an aesthetic when they're done right. Is it dead-on, exactly like *The Shining*? Did they copy all the fine points of Kubrick's aesthetic, find space for the moving tricycle shots, keep the slow zoom-in, zoom-outs, and have the patience to slow down the pace and let a sensation of creeping psychological dread do the heavy-lifting in scaring the audience? No, and I think it's good they didn't. It's enough of a departure from the tone of the rest of the movie without going too far as to disrupt the pace.  
Once Aech runs off, they make the scares more obvious than in the original, but because of their initial entrance into the Overlook Hotel, with the intensity  of the audio and camera motions dropping, that distinctly claustropohbic look of the walls, and, yes, the copied establishing shot, I was set up to buy that I was watching *the* Overlook Hotel.

Wade even attends high school in the OASIS because the education is better, he gets a basic OASIS rig for free, and there's no commute needed.

In the movie, Aech's truck didn't even seem to have the solar panel rig from the book.

The IOI loyalty centers also just showed all the workers doing labor in the OASIS, which makes no damn sense. They're supposed to be doing tech support and other mind-numbing real-world tasks. What the hell's the point of using a real person to move boxes and shit in a virtual world?",87yv63

dwyuz5a,"I seem to remember a contest in an Atari 2600 (?) scroller game set in the desert where if you found a certain relic you could send on proof ( a picture) and win a huge prize. I played with a friend who owned it and it was a up scroller. I mean you pressed up on the joystick and your character walked up through the dessert. You could find other relics in oases or from traders, or I think by bumping into palm trees?  At any rate I started anew game one time and was being silly and started walking down. And sure enough you could go down some and there was an oasis and once you touched it, boom... you had the special relic. But my friend thought it was from a nearby trader. At any rate we didn’t do all the other required tasks to win the game, and the contest may have been over anyway, so we didn’t win the prize. 

Oh well. It’s true when you have nothing to lose you take chances doing silly stuff like going backwards. But when the risk is zeroing out and having to start a “life” over with nothing.  That might be too much of a risk to waste a chance on something silly.

For example in the book there is a about a cross over episode of Simon and Simon and Wizkids.  Where as I lived through that no one in the theater is going to understand it.  I believe that because of this they had to change a lot of the reference material to simply general  ""movie"" and ""video games"" references so that the average viewer would ""get it"" better.

However nothing in the movie is done to make the world a better place. The stakes are that they might lose the one thing everyone likes.

One thing i have to say about this movie is Chekhov's gun is followed very well. A lot of the stuff they show and talk about such as the holy hand grenade, the rubric cube, the iron giant, and the catalyst are all shown early on in the film and used instead of just being abandoned and forgotten about. It would have been easy for Parzival to talk about lightsabers, railguns, master swords, pokeballs, crowbars, portal guns, hidden blades, iron man suits, batarangs, heat vision, katanas, or some other weapon and never use them.

the highlight in life is the world you choose to be in. that is ""magic"" of games (or cars, or painting, or whatever hobby you choose to delve into). and i think the movie captured that beautifully.

i also like that they didnt choose to go for the low hanging fruit and pick on the hardcore gamer crowd ala villain's in game lackey, like showing him as a loser living in a shithole. if anything, he should be pretty well to do since he's a power gamer and oasis' currency as they show are basically a globally accepted form of legal tender.",87yv63

I didn't see the movie any one way. RP1 offers so much rich, deep content to mull over. I only realized when thinking back on it later that this was a really subtle, clever angle they put in there. Artemis starts out as this annoying know-it-all in the first scene who talks down to Parzival and then by the end of the movie other characters are describing her as someone who's wandering around like she doesn't know where she is. Overall her character is balanced and not implausibly smart, successful, confident, admired or powerful. She has her fair share of achievements and weaknesses.",87yv63

It was obvious visually several times that those five people were at the top of the score board. They very explicitly focus on it twice, when the first and second keys are found.

I'm not certain of this, but I think the first time the term is used is during the speech trying to rally everyone to come to Planet Doom.

My assumption coming into the movie blind was that the ""High Five"" was basically a fan nickname that the group decided to adopt, especially since they weren't formally clanned (I don't know if clanning is supposed to have some formal mechanic within the OASIS or not). They were definitely a de facto clan in any case, at least as early as when they got the second key.

Parzival ""formally"" adopted the name in his speech to make it clear to everyone what was happening, and to give the whole thing a team dynamic. Basically ""yeah, we're a team, who wants to be part of it?"" Basic psychology.",87yv63

I don't get why book readers always want/expect a movie adaptation to be an exact copy of the book. If I had to make a movie the exact same as the book source material, then what would be the point of making the movie in the first place? I just don't get it.
There is a reason it's called an adaptation, not an IMITATION.

They tried to force this uncomfortable idea that there was a rebellion that Art3mis was leading when in the book her character was STAUNCHLY against working with anyone else. They changed Shoto's character to an 11 year old kid so his avenging of Daito's death was made redundant \(and for some reason, they made him Chinese?\) It added absolutely nothing to the film aside from ""we didn't really need another Asian male character, let's just make him a child instead"".",87yv63

> What wrong with the references? If you have a car race what wrong with having a handful of the background cars being references?

Absolutely nothing. But where the story was constructed to the references were a vital part of the story in the book, here they felt incidental at best. It was like someone said 'we have this story but hey, nostalgia's pretty big now so every so often drop in a nod to that'. ",87yv63
dxxobvq,"It's because in the movies the references are mostly there for the sake of references, where in the book it shows how Halliday was obsessed with his childhood growing up in the 80s, hence incorporating a crap ton of 80s references into the easter egg hunt, giving the refs a reason to exist. In the movie the 80s references that they do try to incorporate aren't given context and Wade's narration at the beginning could've provided a few seconds of context to serve the rest of the movie. I agree that the movie should be regarded on it's own instead of in comparison to the book, but how the movie handled the refs compared to the book is kinda ehhhh when you think about it. [an example of the ""few seconds of context"" could be Wade explaining how Halliday was obsessed with pop culture or smth]. ",87yv63

If you're saying the quest was supposed to give it all purpose then sure but what's not to say it just won't return to how it was before.  I think what you're trying to say may come more from the books because I feel there is a deeper meaning that gets touched upon but ultimately goes nowhere with Halliday being just a simple person who wanted to make a fun game to enjoy but that ultimately got lost.  If that's the case then sure but that is seemingly lost in translation.

This movie is unabashedly showing you whatever it thought you want to see, regardless of its origin.

And then you get one big ass homage to that TV show in a movie directed by Spielberg, and it's the thing from the original in all its motherfucking glory. Badass intro to it and, despite how short it was, badass fight for it.

1. Socially policed. Someone acts hostile in an area most people would consider non-PVP then everyone around them puts them down ASAP.

2. There are actual rules, but the nightclub, being a half-finished creation, had poorly defined rules.

I like that the film transforms this portion of the hunt, which in the book is very introspective to the character and specific to the nostalgia gimmick. Depicting Wade's encyclopedic knowledge of Halliday through the Curator spares us from too much dialogue and also ties into the theme of socialization; Wade already knows the keys to understanding, but it isn't until [after meeting Art3mis](#spoiler) that he can draw the connection, thereby coaxing him from his self-exile from reality.

They spend a few months dating online between first gate solved and finding second key. He says “I love you” at end of that and she breaks it off. He spends a month or two depressed after.

Way more 80s stuff in the book and they explain it better. Because of Halliday’s fixation with it and popularity of Egg Hunt, it becomes dominant pop culture again.

Over the moths the book spans, High 5 become celebs and get endorsement deals, Sho and Daito even get a cartoon made about them. Before finding first key Art3mis is a famous Egg Hunt blogger.

Oh, there’s also a bonus chapter that explains Sorrento’s intent to betray IOI and hit the kill switch on the Oasis if he finds the Egg first (we learn his sister died because she was addicted to it).",87yv63

It's like how each employee in IOI has to go to a new station when they die; there may be something that ties them to a specific station (IP address?) and thus they need to swap. For the general populace, that may not be a luxury they have.

Driving backwards in Mario Kart simply leads you to the same track you'd reach when driving forward. The situation in Oasis isn't the same.

It was a poor ending and way more satisfying where the movie had it. Also fine with having the other characters do more.  The last half of the book is parzival doing everything and the other 4 just commenting.  Hell Artemis turns into a total jealous  bitch because she is losing to parzival.  ,87yv63

It felt like the move tried to just imply it by showing their interactions being more familiar with each scene near the beginning, but it still felt like less time was passing than in the book which made their relationship feel very rushed.

Really I think it's a kind of common issue when translating books to movies.  There isn't time to fit everything from the book into the movie, so the plot gets priority and character development often gets cut, and that definitely happened here.

Personally, I still enjoyed the movie, and I think changes to some of the details (e.g. the challenges being completely different) were fine, but it definitely got hurt by a large portion of the character development (both for Wade on his own, and for the High Five coming together) getting cut.",87yv63

There are some questionable changes to adapt the novel to the screen (my biggest peeve is how short-changed the rest of the High Five are as characters-- I wish there were a way to get some of that into the movie), but I feel like as a whole the changes made were necessary to make a watchable film that's relatable now in 2018.",87yv63

I did not read the book myself so i cannot judge what the source material is. I’m a 90’s kid so i have my fair share of nostalgic moments. I really enjoyed stranger things and IT because the characters acted like what you would expect them to act. This movie though, is set in the future with the focus on the gamer/nerd culture, but this culture seems stuck in the 80’s with the nerds being nice to each other even though they live a hard life and are indebted because of the game. The villain makes stupid decisions even with advanced tech and resources in hand and the story is resolved in the sappiest way possible. In short, this movie is very unbelievable because the characters are too stupid/ naive for the futuristic setting which should not be because we know how smart today’s youngsters are.

None of the characters even reacted to it, which adds to my (previously unsaid) point of there not being any coherence to their references.

There are a few, such as the Iron Giant, Mechagodzilla, and the Gundam that do affect the plot, but even these are just the main characters reskinned for the sake of putting them into the movie, and not the characters themselves 

Whereas in Who Framed Roger Rabbit it's still those actual characters. It keeps their history that they had and extends them, affecting the plot in the process.

Edit: If you liked the movie, then I'm glad. I'm not sure how to really reply to a comment sarcastically saying the thoughts I had were very original, seeing as the majority of the comments here in this thread think highly of the movie.

So, let me say it again. If you liked the movie, I'm glad. I personally did not, that's all. ",87yv63
dwnnrir,"Yes, both in theaters. 

The boringness is really going to depend on how much you like nostalgia pandered to you and how invested you are in these characters growth and investment.

For me, the nostalgia was stupid. This is just an excuse (and the book too) to fit as much pop-culture crap as you can in to one movie. The film relies on you having moments where you connect not with the characters in the movie but the avatars that they embody.

For me, there were no stakes in this movie. It’s likely why the action scenes didn’t resonate with me. The racing scene happens very early in the movie. It’s just one big digital vomit thrown at your face and you’re supposed to pop for things you love. OMG a Delorean! OMG a T-Rex! Wow it’s King Kong!

For me, the sequence came off flat. I don’t care about any of the references and I know there’s no danger because we’re just in VR.

Even the real-world scenes where there is a heightened sense of danger didn’t resonate. Because I know that by the end of the movie the main characters are going to live and the boy and the girl are going to live happily ever after.

This is not a BAD movie. I’d never say that (though my wife has corrected me every time I say that by letting me know that it is, indeed, a bad movie) but it’s just dull. No significant character development, a by the numbers plot, and a visual mess on the screen at almost all times with so much going on that it’s hard to even focus on one thing.

Yes I stand corrected, although the reference makes little sense thematically.

> No? I see this brought up time and time again. If it's Mario Kart, the first thing I'd try is the speed boost trick during the countdown. Why would going backwards be the first thing someone would try? Not to mention, racing games today are on a continuous looping track, so going backwards just results in them driving the course in reverse with a warning popping up telling them so. The movie's race course was linear with the consequence of losing your avatar + all your belongings if you died. When Oasis is seemingly all these players have/value in life, it isn't likely going to be something they're going to throw away to test a hunch.

I also got most of the newer references, granted my gaming time is far less that it was 10-15 years ago since I have a family, so I totally didn’t get some of the new stuff (you mentioned Undertale, which I’ve heard of but never played so any reference in-movie was missed by me)

I think they (especially Cline) had the opportunity to fix the problems of the book and instead created new ones and amplified the issues in the book.

At least in the book the answers to the gates and finding the keys relied on ridiculous arcane knowlege about random geeky things. Like entering a movie, in the book Wade had to know Wargames word for word, with perfect inflection in the lines and blocking of the main character to earn the key.
 
While in the movie when they enter [The Shiningthey don’t actually have to know anything about the movie to win the key, it just helps because there is a time limit and you know what NOT to do (don’t follow the twins, don’t go into room 237, etc). They only figured out where to go b/c Aech stumbled on the pic of Kira and](#spoiler) he only did that because of his LACK of movie knowledge. That’s a big difference to me.

But to make the points I wanted to in my original post (but fail at spoiler tags) 

Gunters and Aech:
[Aech is a world class Gunter, one of the best of the best. Best friend of Wade and he’s never seen The Shining, even though the the the movie just told us that it’s Halliday’s #11 favorite horror movie. The excuse given is Aech doesn’t  like scary movies, but it’s unbelievable that ANY Gunter, let alone Aech of all people, would never have watched The Shinning. I really enjoyed that scene. It was funny and one of the best scenes in the movie. But it doesn’t make any sense. Not in the context of the book, not in the context of the movie. You’re telling me Aech never even went to Wiki or the archives and just read the plot? Didn’t gleam it from pop culture osmosis? Just... Nothing.](#spoiler)

Fame and Art3mis:
[After finding the Copper Key, Wade goes to the Archives to do his usual Gunter-ing, but gets attacked by a mob demanding selfies. Art3mis gets him out of that situation, takes off her disguise, and tells him that now that he is famous he needs to hide who he is to go to places like that without getting swarmed. She gives him a disguise and then proceeds to walk out right next to him in her normal avatar, through the Gunter infested archives. This is ridiculous because 1) she herself is #2 on the leaderboard and thus is just as famous as Wade. 2) She was already famous before that, which is why she had those Clark Kent glasses in the first place to let Wade use them. Wade recognizes her when she has a motorcycle helment on from basically just her lips and chin on a racetrack and yet a room full of Gunters and NO ONE RECOGNIZES HER.](#spoiler)

But hey, right before that the Chestbuster joke was funny, so who cares right?

Those to me are a microcosm of some of the problems I have with the movie. These types of issues are just more egregious in the movie version to me. But idk, maybe you’re right. I’m so mad right now I can’t even see straight and may process the movie diffent later.

They are never “strict” about only using 80s references and it isn’t a  “convenience” in the book when they show references other than the 80s.

The Oasis has everything in it, not just the 80s, and everything that has to do with *The Hunt* is done through Halliday’s life, which comprised of his formative years in the 70s and 80s. 

Since we are reading through the perspective of someone (Wade) looking for Halliday’s Egg, it makes sense they would be experts on such things (70s and 80s) but because Wade is his own person he has his own interests as well (like *Firefly*). 

*Monty Python and the Holy Grail* didn’t come out in the 80s but that’s a pretty significant part of the book because it was significant to Halliday. 

Same goes with *Rush 2112*, that isn’t 80s either and played a pretty huge role in the book. 

The book never says it is “strict” to the 80s but it is strict to **pop culture**, so whenever they show other things like the *The Lord of the Rings* Planet or *Firefly* it works because first and foremost The Oasis is about having everything. ",87yv63

dwxaomg,">Ready Player One is the 20 piece McNugget of movies. You think it’s a great idea beforehand, and about a third of the way in you realize it’s awful and afterward you just kinda regret spending money on it

For me it was the opposite, the film started off kind of weakly and I was like ""Oh Christ, I'm gonna have to sit through another two hours of this shit"" but it got better \(not spectacularly so, but just better IMO\) through the middle portion of the movie.

I'm assuming most of the Wade Watts internal monologue / talking to the audience stuff was almost verbatim from the book, or at least a somewhat literal translation with some pop culture references replaced with others? I didn't like it that much.

Sometimes that kind of dialog and communication can work well in film media if you have compelling dialog and a very talented actor playing an interesting character but in this movie it felt like... it was there to cover for a lack of film\-making ability and creativity. Not being able to figure out how to show something visually and instead just resorting to having the protagonist directly verbally telling things to the audience.

I'm trying not to shit on Spielberg for that because I think he is a good director but I feel that someone like Edgar Wright would have found a more interesting, creative, visually\-stimulating, and apropos way to communicate that information.

>Edit: also, how the fuck are you not going to have a post\-credits scene in a movie about easter eggs? shocking.

That honestly surprised me too. All I can think to say is that it's because this movie just isn't that creative. Which kind of bummed me out.

It was a weird feeling when I realized that the little bits of momentary joy I got from certain scenes actually came from the fact that I was recognizing it from another, better, more culturally iconic and creative piece of media. A Pavlovian response to pop culture references.

It's like the heart\-warming moment equivalent to *Family Guy*'s pop culture reference gags that everybody shits on for being lazy and uncreative.",87yv63

dwm8w5h,"Not the guy you were replying to, but wanted to add my two cents because I was trying to think of things that made he movie feel off, or which could have been improved.

Firstly the first 20 minutes or so of the film are oversaturated with narrative exposition from the main character. It's very distracting and honestly comes across as lazy. A better way of going about delivering this information would be presenting it in a form that's makes sense diegetically. I was thinking they could have the character start the movie off in a school setting, be forced to watch some boring documentary about ""modern history,"" including Halliday, the origins of The Oasis, the nature of the game, the fallout between Halliday and Morrow, and the various problems facing the world of the film, with the characters complaining about knowing all this stuff. You can even have two characters engaging in a conversation during the documentary and get extra information than that conversation. 

Beyond that I felt like the movie didn't conserve its characters very well. In my opinion, the film would have been better served by removing the character of Finale and giving extra screen time to iRock. Have the big bad be Sorrento, and have iRock be his mercenary, the Boba Fett to his Vader. Maybe have him hunt the characters for a large part of the film and be a genuine threat instead of comic relief. He could maybe have shown up during the challenge for the second key and steal it out from under the protagonists, establish a second act low-point that sees IOI one-upping the heroes. Generate a little tension by having the bad guys actually win something. Part of what made the movie feel tensionless for me was that everyone at IOI seemed like an idiot. If they actually were able to best the heroes at some point in the game itself it might make them seem like something of a threat.

In addition the film just didn't have a lot for the various characters, beyond Wade and Samantha, to do. Something the Jumanji sequel gets right is the efficient division of skill sets. They make a fairly big deal out of the characters forming a 5 man clan to get the final key and win the prize, but two of them don't do anything that makes them special beyond having an item that temporarily makes them more powerful, and Wade and Samantha seem almost identically competent in their skill sets. Make it so that Wade is the expert at puzzles and solving the riddles, but terrible at the actual challenges or at fighting. Then, let Samantha and Aech be the muscle who wipe-out the IOI guys and have to fight iRock in the end while Wade and Sorrento fight for the final key. Samantha and Aech can also have specific talents within that, like Aech can be the mechanics and heavy weapons, while Samantha is more sneaky or infiltration oriented, which would be in keeping with what they have the characters do in the film. It would also add a degree of realism in regards to how people have preferred playstyles for their videogames. Also, get rid of the Daito and Sho, because they add abysmally little character wise to the film, and they weren't very important in the book either. Finally, Aech's actress was abysmal in this movie. I've heard she's good in other things, but she seemed like she was reading her lines off of cue cards in this movie.

That being said, the movie did a good job of taking things that Wade did in the book and giving those cool set pieces to other characters, as it made them feel more significant or impactful than they otherwise would have been. This is especially true for Samantha, but is true for Daito to a lesser extent, as almost everything of significance either of those characters did was something Wade Watts did in the book. Also, on a smaller note, the strangest thing in the movie was that the Archivist was always waiting on players to come ask it questions, as if it were a pre-programmed AI (it seemed to have a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of the archive), but then we find out that it was Ogden Morrow the whole time. So, was he just waiting there literally all the time for people to come by and ask questions? Didn't he have a life to live? Didn't he ever sleep, or eat, or...do anything besides that?

Anyway, I want to be honest about where I'm coming from before I go on.

I did see the movie and thought it was mostly ok. Not one of Spielburg's best by any measure, but I enjoyed it more than reading the book. I do think it had quite a few flaws and people who are calling it trash are picking up on them pretty well. Simply changing things isn't always one of them though. 

Watching someone go through the[Tomb of Horrors might have been entertaining, but watching three games of Joust would have been pretty boring, as would watching a perfect game of Pacman. Watching the gate challenges as written in the book would not have worked. The only option would have been to montage all of these and that would have also been terrible.](#spoiler) So simplify it all and turn the challenges into something better for film. Og in the book is [pretty much a Deus ex Machina. It kind of works because he doesn't solve ultimate conflicts, but he certainly comes out of nowhere with a lot of aid.](#spoiler) Removing him gives the characters more agency, improving the story overall. Removing the Gates just simplifies the story and allows more time for characters etc.

I am a little surprised that after removing [the joust challenge](#spoiler) they went with the final challenge in the way they did, I guess they figured with the battle the excitement stays but I'm not sure it makes a great climax. 

Take a look at Lord of the Rings, there were many changes in the movies but they are generally seen as great adaptations. I wouldn't say this is as successful and I'm not surprised that people who loved the book didn't love the movie. I think there will be a lot of people who do. I didn't really love either, and if I felt either were done better I probably would. There's a lot about this that is right up my alley. I do feel there was potential that the movie didn't capitalize on. OC I feel that about the book too.",87yv63
dx71e55,"I've read the book and liked the movie.  IMO, you guys are conflating a good adaptation with an adaptation that sticks as closely to the book as possible.  Those aren't the same thing.

Film and novels are wildly different media. When adaptations are made, you have to respect the strengths and weaknesses of each.  Like, could you imagine the War Games scene put to film? It would be unwatchable.  And consider the amount of first-person narration Wade does in the books. Do you want a 6-hour movie of nothing but voice over?  

I thought it was great that the movie took the spirit of the source material and *adapted it to be successful on film.* Even in the smallest of ways: there were mini references to almost every Spielberg movie sprinkled in.  That's a very cool, meta thing to do, that fits the spirit of the source material to a tee, even if it diverges from it.

They should also get broadcasting rights from Mars so they can start the first low gravity sports and have Low Gravity ""Cross Check Plus""!

Having quad druple the amount of teams on earth and mars means more players for me to memorize and obsess over with my Dad who won't talk to me about anything else.

So, in summary, you are a negative troll who A) doesn't understand the themes within *The Iron Giant* (if you did, you would understand why it works within *RPO*), B) doesn't understand the simple themes of *RPO* (or you are ignorant, which is worse) and C) thinks they are better than people who... *like things that you don't* (crazy thought, I know), which constitutes you as nothing more than a pretentious asshole. 

I would say have a good one but I really wouldn't mean it. ",87yv63

dwh6oe4,It was [pacman and in the book he had to get a perfect score](#spoiler). But in my opinion i'm glad they omitted this part because in the book it takes Wade a bunch of tries to do it and if they adapted that into the movie it would've been a real momentum killer for the movie,87yv63
dwh7zbl,"In the book, I thought he was chasing a key while playing Pac-Man. The quarter ended up just being a bonus, right?",87yv63
dwh84z0,The problem was the movie didn't have time to put everyone into a slump following the copper gate completion like the book did. So the idea of Parzival chasing a lead and spending a bunch of time playing Pac-Man just wouldn't have been filmable as a sequence that could make it into the film. None of the challenges in the movie stop anyone for long once the copper key race gets figured out. That's actually a good thing because the idea of nerds being stumped by the jade key riddle for months in the book just made no sense. Zork is not an obscure title by any means. But it also means they had to cram the extra life in somewhere without it being too weird. I think what they ended up doing was fine. ,87yv63

dwsudv2,"You're absolutely right that a large part of the movie is basically just showing off references to other media, but the reason I enjoyed it so much is those references were done lovingly and tastefully. I suppose it could be described as nothing more than a list, but I felt like each and every reference actually captured the spirit of their source material, or they were at least innocuous enough that it didn't matter. 

Usually when you see this sort of thing, the references are crammed in in a very cynical manner that makes them feel more like product placement. Probably the closest thing we get to that in this movie is the Minecraft world seen at the beginning. I wasn't a huge fan of how that was fit in. Imagine how horrible this would have been if *every reference in the movie* was done like that.",87yv63
dwsydu1,"It seemed that for the most part the references played a purpose in the narrative. There's Chekov's Iron Giant, (most) of The Shining sequence were used as a defense against the second key, and King Kong is the primary conflict of the first act. 

Sure there were a lot of references that were gratuitous, but this film didn't market itself as a sincere exploration of a dystopian future run by facist corporations. It marketed itself as ""come see if you can find all the easter eggs we hid in our movie"". It didn't lie to audiences to increase revenue, and you have to respect the film for that. It was a fun movie. Nothing extraordinary, but it was fun.",87yv63
dwsmmy0,"> is that all you want from a movie?

What? No. When I watched the Godfather did I need references that make me go 'bazing!'? No I enjoyed the artful film-making of FFC with an absolute masterclass from Pacino and Brando.  
When I watched Blade Runner 2049 did I need references? No I think I just enjoyed the breathtaking cinematography. When I say I legitimately love Under Siege 2 is it because it's a great film? No it's awfully made and stupid as which is what makes it so darn entertaining.  

Does everything need a high-brow explanation? They're fun references that remind you of how fun the escapism of video games and movies can be. ",87yv63

Cursing doesn't make a movie an adult movie. They say fuck once and then no other cursing. There isn't sexual themes or there isn't blood.

There are enough references to modern pop culture that kids can be perfectly happy watching the movie. The 80's stuff is important to the plot but they also hold your hand with expositional dialogue so you're not lost.

It's a movie for kids, but that doesn't mean its a bad movie",87yv63

Wade's avatar is dirt poor and he couldn't even go to the fancy VR planets so he's stuck in the school world.

Also, I really don’t know the details, but co-wrote is a broad term. Maybe it was mostly ghost written. Slash and Keith Richards “co-wrote” their autobiographies. Those books certainly involved ghost writers.

I really thought they dumbed down that movie by a lot compared to the book. I had so many problems with the movie that I could go on for ages. I was really, really disappointed. I do realize that the book was extremely complex and convoluted, a very hard book to adapt into a movie. Same difficulty level as, say, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Just hard as fuck to reproduce accurately. 

I don’t see why I get downvotes, the two stories were incongruent and the movie was more “based” on the book than a movie version of the book. I know that people already mentioned that it wasn’t supposed to be a direct adaptation or whatever but I still thought it was lame. 

I feel the same way about this Ready Player One movie as the new Wrinkle in Time movie. It was good when judged as a separate entity from the source material, but as an adaptation of one of my favorite books (I also felt especially strong about a Wrinkle in Time which might literally be my favorite book, a delicately composed work of genius), I found it ham-handed, oversimplified, and thematically distracted by things the author didn’t really focus on in their original work. I wish there was a proper adjective to describe the specific oversimplification techniques that contemporary films use. They are all a very unique flavor of obnoxious, the late 2010s aesthetic is just becoming unadulterated cringe.

Like I said, there are two Ready Player Ones.

I disagree with what you said about Ogg disturbing the plot. I think they should have included his Oregon mansion in the movie. Maybe the fact they met IRL early messes with Ogg’s place in the plot rather than vice versa. 

I also don’t like how they foisted the Pac Man extra life scene in the book onto the bet with the curator in the movie. 

I wanted to see the old video game aesthetics, see references to 80s deep cuts. Instead it was like someone boiled down an ounce of Transformers 3 and injected it into the story. 

Oversimplified, focused too much on visuals, explosions, and effects for such a plot based story. I also though the visual aesthetic was way off and should have been more 8-bit and neon. A good comparison would be the Tron remake, which I actually though was really well done.

Obviously I didn’t like it so sorry if I’m offending fans. I just really hated what they did with this movie. I was expecting something totally different. 

I wanted to see the Rush guitar challenge for the 3rd key. Parzival is from a shithole in Oklahoma in the book, Ohio is like this gleaming far away place where he travels and obtains an apartment. Totally skipped that in the movie too. 

There was just like no similarity, like at all. The school planet? Him beginning the story as a genuine, dejected, ugly loser? That’s important to the plot/theme. In the book the first challenge was a maze that ended with a video game contest against a boss, who was an obscure character from 80s pop culture! Just too many differences to even mention. I found it really frustrating. 

One positive thing: I actually really liked their depiction of IOI. I thought it was chillingly realistic, having experienced corporate America myself. Wish they had gone more in depth with that and had gone with the original Parzival hacks IOI as a slave instead of the free Art3mis thing they did in the movie. Would have been cool, I thought they picked a good Sorrento. As a San Franciscan I feel like I’ve met people who are like him in real life a lot.

It wouldn’t have been a bad film in my opinion if it were an original idea but as an adaptation it was garbage IMHO, SNS.",87yv63
dx5yu7x,"See that’s exactly what bothered me. 

The movie targets people who weren’t even born by the time 1990 hit or even 2000 for that matter at this point. The layers of subtle pop culture references from the 1980s were supposed to be a big part of the fun of the story. 

Not only did they leave that out, they didn’t even do a particularly good job of illustrating the rancid dystopia of a world that the Oasis was designed as a coping mechanism for. Nor do they highlight the extreme poverty Parzival was born into. In fact, the scene in the beginning of the movie where he’s climbing down to put on his Oasis suit kind of gives his horror show trailer park stack complex a whimsical, neighborly vibe which was not at all the way it was portrayed in the novel. The abusive caretakers were not intensely abusive like they were in the book. They were kinda just trailer trash dumbasses.

Parzival’s awkward quirks, feelings of intellectual mediocrity, and general weirdness are what makes him the sympathetic antihero we all want to root for, can identify with. By scrubbing the nastiness of future earth and the flaws in not only Parzival’s but everyone’s characters, they more or less erased the original point and theme of the story, not to mention a great deal of the heady substance. The parts where Parzival shaves his body and holes himself in the Oasis apartment that’s just an empty cube...the part where he imprisons himself and hacks his way out of IOI. They left out all the good parts!

And all the 80s references would shoot directly over the heads of the target demographic, and Hollywood plays for cash, so I walked into the theater expecting greatness and walked out feeling like I did after I saw Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift or Die Hard. Not what I pictured. Very disappointing, 3/10 for FX and superficial entertainment value. I liked Anorak and Halliday in general, that is the only part of the movie where I thought they did a good job adhering to the original character.

I also agree a lot of the book was sappy teenage bs but it was still a heady book and it deserved better justice than Spielberg did it. It’s weird too cuz I got real excited when I heard he directed it, considering he is a major creator behind a lot of the pop culture referenced in the novel. I guess we know where the priorities are in Hollywood ($&$).",87yv63

I imagine, however, that the notion of PK'ing is handled like (of all things) the movie, The Purge. That is, the idea being that while people could go out and kill others with no repercussions, the thing that stops them from actually doing so that it then puts a target on their back.

So in terms of PK'ing in Oasis, if word gets around that there's a PK'er running loose, it gives greater justification for people to join a clan/guild and hunt them down, making the act of PK'ing less favorable. But of course, there are disguises that lets the avatars hide their identity... so... yeah, plot hole?

The main villain becoming a bumbling idiot who was not afraid to blow up innocent people but too afraid to shoot Perzival in the end. The complete rearrangement of the story and making it so that they stumble into almost everything and required no real skill out knowledge of Hallidays life in order to get through each clue. The ending where it is simply finding the Easter egg wins the contest with no real leadup to the fact that adventure would be the game that needs to be played. His extra life being won on a bet and not him trying to find the second gate and getting a perfect score on Pacman cheapened it. The Shining being included and adding zombies to it is an attrocity in it of itself. It basically was CGI Wizard of Oz by having them all team up and basically be the miniscule helpers to Perzival instead of them being all on their own working for independent motives to reach the final gate only to realize that Halliday made it so they would have to work together in order to get past the final gate.

>Problem is what it doesn't explain is how someone can presumably tell another character they just met ""I Love You"".

I doesn't but that's a sacrifice they had to make when they compressed the time scale. A genuine romance and affection that built up over time became a silly infatuation. I know when I was a teenage boy I could get infatuated pretty fast. It's not unnatural. But *saying* it is. But then again that kinda makes sense with the Oasis reducing people's inhibitions and all.

I think what's important about that scene and the romance is how it functions in the movie. The romance features very little. (More time for mecha Godzilla and all that). Why not just disgard it all together then? Because him telling her he loves her and, more importantly, saying he wants to meet her in real life was a means to start exploring her character in a world where people aren't usually their real selves. It might have been blunt but it was an effective way to develop the character for the audience rather than delaying that till they meet up later. So although it might have been a bit forced it was done for a good reason imo.",87yv63

Adventure time also did it more recently with B.M.O. enjoying being a godlike avatar on an island with humans being taken care by drones as everyone lives in the VR and that society has become so dependent all the humans are weak.

My personal favourite was EPIC. Another young adult novel with less of a nostalgia and more focused on telling a story. The plot is earth has colonized other planets and on one planet a VR MMORPG was created to give the colonizers something to do to survive the boredom of travel and colonizing.  Earth is in the distant past and the MMORPG is there way of life. All real world physical violence is outlawed and their society is built within the game. They settle disputes in the arena, they win resources for their settlements in the arena. Their status, their wealth, their life. People dumped all their stats in physical stats and grind all the time to get somewhere in life.

The movie did do that. When Arty goes to Aech's shop to fix her bike, her and Wade have a nerd off saying how each has learned all the geek stuff Halliday loved.

The problem if you make references a core part of the story is what happens if some in the audience don't get the reference? They can't afford to alienate part of the audience because they didn't 'get it'. If you have never played a video game in your life you could still enjoy this movie.

If you think ""Halliday is being just a simple person who wanted to make a fun game to enjoy bu that ultimately got lost"" then you were asleep for 90% of the film or just weren't paying attention.

Halliday is an autistic/Asperger's spectrum, yes? He can't even touch people, have a gf, have a friend. So the OASIS becomes his Oasis, yet it never satisfies the real needs for ANY human. So the place is WEIRD. Slice someone and coins spill out. Look at how weird the school planet is.. how memories are processed. It's not merely a 'fun' experience, it's perverse and Spielberg does everything he can to make it seem fluid and achieve normality, but it doesn't (unless you're tuning it out and seeing the surface).

So he dies, but before he figures out how to absorb his consciousness, and gets to set up his own release from his prison (his childhood room) as a quest that APPEARS to be all about nostalgia, but if you read it right, the nostalgia's just lure. And the puzzles are first figurative (easily drive backwards on a level DEEPER than the nostalgia), and then they transition to interpersonal, use the figurative puzzle rule and apply it to getting deeper into Halliday's brain.

In the end it's the same kind of flip the script with Neo's being saved by Trinity, and it's never explained what's going on.

Wade saves Halliday. Wade saves the Oasis. He now knows what a trap it is.

You could *assume* all day until the sun burns out on scenarios, but literally proves none of them without context.  
  
Them showing Sorrento's ""change of heart"" at the end of the movie is supposed to signal that message, along with Wade's dialogue forcing IOI to change their model, the ""Loyalty Program"" was the reason for it's rise to power in the first place.  
  
Also, one of the biggest reasons for IOI existence is due to Halliday's easter egg event itself. With it now being over, their mission statement is no longer existant and they serve no purpose. Stakeholders will move on, naturally.

Its superficiality doesn't become less superficial just because it's a blockbuster film. It just shows how hollow those movies can be.

Because you can do plenty of cinematically interesting thing with nostalgia, even in a 'popcorn flick'. Star Wars: The Last Jedi did so for example, with its loud & proud rejection of wallowing in the past. It wasn't subtle, and we can discuss how well it executed it, but at least it attempted to do something. It had *ideas.* Ready Player One has none of that. It's the worst kind of nostalgia.

A lot of world-building was missing, and in the book the characters didn't all just kind of mysteriously converge on Columbus together, but I imagine that was done to simplify things.

They did also cut a lot of character development, which was unfortunate.

Ultraman could be used once a day for 3 minutes, but if you failed to deactivate before that timer was up, you would die.

He was already familiar with Parzival from all the visits, but I think that moment was really important to Ogden.  Since we didn't get the book moments, this short scene was critical.

Glad we saw a similar importance in that scene.

But the coin, Wade gets that from playing Pacman (it has been a while since I read the book, but I am pretty sure it was Pacman).  He finds the coin behind/under the arcade machine.

The book does nothing for me. This might be a cliche criticism but it is one for a reason, it really is just reference overload so people who identify themselves through ""nerd culture"" can pat themselves on the back for pouring so much time into it. In book form this does nothing for me, I know I can ""imagine"" the descriptions of events but it's all pre existing properties, am I really even using my own imagination? I would, however, be up for seeing those set pieces rendered in a multi million dollar blockbuster.

I'm really seeing this for the value of seeing cool visuals and that alone, the story is a mess of nothing. That being said since that comment I heard about a few of the changes Spielberg made and they seem a bit more thoughtful than the ideas in the book. Not to spoil anything but just knowing pop culture trivia isn't what the movie is apparently about, which is reassuring.

when he meets her, at first he doesnt see much of a difference between her and her avatar, and then she brushes her hair aside to reveal the port wine stain birthmark on half her face, and all Parzival can think is ""wow shes beautiful"" and shes relieved he doesnt find her hideous or anything.

And people are probably used to idiots running around in VR and just give them a wide berth when they see the goggles on.

Besides, it was an extraordinary situation. Maybe the players were so wrapped up in what was happening in VR they were failing to consider the potential consequences IRL. Wasn't the group shown literally running a bunch of kids?

That's the book in a nutshell. Saying it's less complex than JK Rowling is paying it a *huge* compliment. If you're thirsty for the references you'll get through it, but there's not anything memorable or interesting about the prose. There's a place for simplicity, but mostly it's just bad. ",87yv63
dwjn0gu,"Well i think the best 'explanation' is that a lot of people didn't have the ability to make new stuff, wide spread depression was going on right now and the big reason the Oasis was popular was because it was only a 25c starting fee. Best game you could buy for a quarter. (Book Detail). So companies such as Valve, EA, Activison, Blizzard etc They could have gone defunct or bought up by Gregarious games so they could use their IPs in their games. As we can see wiht valve right now, you could make a billion on a new game or make ten billion selling cosmetics, other games, and other stuff that they could add in later. As explained in the book, ""The Oasis allowed Americans to continue their favorite past time, shopping.""(Paraphrased). People buying digital goods made most of the money in the Oasis. 

Original Characters are being made by Indie ""Developers"" who're probably using these characters for their own avatars. If i was in the Oasis i would make my character based off of my D&D character. But my D&D character is not very unique, he's basically Kylo Ren except 7 feet tall and long white hair. People make these unique characters and probably sell them but like a lot of indie games, they don't sell as well. Another explanation could be Pay to Win, Tracer/Batman/Superman/Chun Li could all be better stat wise than the other characters. 

You have a 'valid' point, but in this 'culture' of the Oasis is one that the 80's is the best, everything John Hughes did is great^except^for^drill^bit^taylor.

And then they could have slowed the fuck down and let us actually experience Wade's actual (and meaningful) rise to stardom within the oasis. The second movie could have portrayed the long doldrums of having no fucking idea what to do next.  

Also they could have taken time to show the high five doing shit on their own (solving the puzzle individually) as opposed to the movie where they are like ""fuck yeah we don't 'clan up' cuz we are real gunters"". Next scene all 5 of them are trying to solve The Shining together...

Wade redeemed him, but not in the religious sense. Halliday literally is the 2.0 version of the Adventure easter egg, he's alive in there. Only not signing the contract redeems him and creates true ownership. It's a multi-facted puzzle that goes back to the beginning of the film. Each test has a surface aspect and a deeper one.

And Halliday isn't a hero, he's tragic. He dies before he experiences friendship and now is forced into an Asperger's near-nightmare of only having his child-self as a friend. It's actually a very dark film and a satire of videogames that can celebrate them.

dwswqqz,"> I doesn't but that's a sacrifice they had to make when they compressed the time scale. 

But there’s absolutely no reason to make a “sacrifice” to compress the time scale, as it simply devalues the rest of the movie.  It cheapened Wade’s relationship with Samantha, and it cheapened the entire premise of Haliday’s Egg Hunt by making it a simple weekend stroll through the Oasis instead of this long, drawn-out and difficult-to-solve puzzle. 

In fact, an 80s themed montage would have been an awesome inclusion in this movie… complete with a Rush song playing in the background perhaps? That way there’s no “sacrifice” to compress the time scale, and the “I Love You” line doesn’t feel completely out of place and forced (which it certainly did in the movie.)

> A genuine romance and affection that built up over time became a silly infatuation. I know when I was a teenage boy I could get infatuated pretty fast. It's not unnatural. But saying it is. But then again that kinda makes sense with the Oasis reducing people's inhibitions and all.

Not really sure what you’re trying to say here, but the line in the movie felt, to me, incredibly unnatural and forced. 

> I think what's important about that scene and the romance is how it functions in the movie. The romance features very little. (More time for mecha Godzilla and all that). Why not just disgard it all together then? Because him telling her he loves her and, more importantly, saying he wants to meet her in real life was a means to start exploring her character in a world where people aren't usually their real selves. It might have been blunt but it was an effective way to develop the character for the audience rather than delaying that till they meet up later. So although it might have been a bit forced it was done for a good reason imo.

You’re entirely missing the point though… I’m saying you can have all that character development, but also have the romance make perfect sense by allowing some time to pass. The movie did not build up to the point where an “I Love You” was anywhere close to warranted, and therefore felt forced, unnatural, and completely out of the blue. And it was because of the compressed time scale that simply wasn’t necessary. ",87yv63

dwu0e9l,"Oof that's such a loaded question. There are so many series. My favorite timeline is the Universal Century (UC) timeline which is the main series however it has so many series, movies, and OVA's it's so hard to enter.


If you just want a taste of Gundam before determining if it's really for you then I recommend starting with one of the Alternate Universe series, which is stand alone and requires no prior knowledge. For this I recommend Iron Blooded Oprhans. It currently has 2 seasons and season 1 alone is enough to give you an idea of this is for you. It's one of the better AU series and features contemporary animation styles and motifs.


After that if you want more, but are not quite ready for UC just yet, I recommend Gundam 00. It's not too dated as the style of of the last decade and follows our calendar system. It's supposed to be our future in a few hundred years following our modern day political conflicts and events.


If at any point you are ready to embark on the long and arduous, yet amazing journey of UC you have to start at the beginning. The original Mobile Suit Gundam from the 70'. Be warned the animation is quite dated and the pacing can be terribly slow. It's 40+ episodes, but a great war drama when it actually picks up. You can also watch the trilogy movies of this series which compiles the series into about 7-8 hours or so.


From here you have a bit of free reign on what to enjoy in the UC timeline:


The following can be enjoyed thoroughly anytime after watching the original MSG:

-8th MS Team (Highly Recommended)

-0080 War in the Pocket

-0083 Stardust memory (foundation for events in Zeta Gundam)

-Thunderbolt (Highly Recommended)

-MS Igloo (dated CGI)


The following are direct sequel series/films and should be watched directly after each other and after the original MSG series. You do not need to watch the side stories I mentioned above for this path, only original MSG.

-Zeta Gundam

-ZZ Gundam

-Char's Counter Attack

-Gundam Unicorn


After all of the above, you can watch any of these:

-Mobile Suit Gundam the Origin (Highly Recommended)

-Gundam F91 (Late UC)

-Gundam Victory (Even later UC)


Finally there's *Reconguista in G* which takes place after the UC system has collapsed, but there's many UC references.


This guy does a great job of explaining it as well:

MXT actually were pretty important plot point in the book and were the driving force behind the first clue being solved. The movie cut that completely.

There are also Gunter clans. They could have one guy enter the race with nothing but a car and hold the rest of his stuff. He's then free to do anything and he will only lose the car. Rinse and repeat to find a way to beat the race.

dx0exa4,"Ready Player One, Chapter 0019, page 193 & 194 (Arrow Books 2012 paperback edition):

You could also purchase an ACHD (anatomically correct haptic doll), if you wanted to have more “intimate” encounters inside the OASIS. ACHDs came in male, female, and dual-sex models, and were available with a wide array of options. Realistic latex skin. Servomotor-driven endoskeletons. Simulated musculature. And all of the attendant appendages and orifices one would imagine.

Driven by loneliness, curiosity, and raging teen hormones, I’d purchased a midrange ACHD, the Shaptic ÜberBetty, a few weeks after Art3mis stopped speaking to me. After spending several highly unproductive days inside a stand-alone brothel simulation called the Pleasuredome, I’d gotten rid of the doll, out of a combination of shame and self-preservation. I’d wasted thousands of credits, missed a whole week of work, and was on the verge of completely abandoning my quest for the egg when I confronted the grim realization that virtual sex, no matter how realistic, was really nothing but glorified, computer-assisted masturbation. At the end of the day, I was still a virgin, all alone in a dark room, humping a lubed-up robot. So I got rid of the ACHD and went back to spanking the monkey the old-fashioned way.

I felt no shame about masturbating. Thanks to *Anorak’s Almanac*, I now thought of it as a normal bodily function, as necessary and natural as sleeping or eating.

*AA 241:87—I would argue that masturbation is the human animal’s most important adaptation. The very cornerstone of our technological civilization. Our hands evolved to grip tools, all right—including our own. You see, thinkers, inventors, and scientists are usually geeks, and geeks have a harder time getting laid than anyone. Without the built-in sexual release valve provided by masturbation, it’s doubtful that early humans would have ever mastered the secrets of fire or discovered the wheel. And you can bet that Galileo, Newton, and Einstein never would have made their discoveries if they hadn’t first been able to clear their heads by slapping the salami (or “knocking a few protons off the old hydrogen atom”). The same goes for Marie Curie. Before she discovered radium, you can be certain she first discovered the little man in the canoe.*

It wasn’t one of Halliday’s more popular theories, but I liked it.",87yv63

dwkn61h,"If you are interested, I dug up the paper from 2012 and here is one of many excerpts describing Rylance's performance:

**EDIT: found a video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW9tu1i1UgA it's not the Globe performance, but it's the same production.

Mark Rylance’s performance is the most unique interpretation of Richard I have ever seen. Richard as portrayed by Rylance seems a slower weaker Richard. Somehow more apologetic and as slow in speech as he is in step. He is still Richard-- cunning and conniving, but with those elements taken from the forefront where they usually are a new dimension to Richard is opened up. For the first time in a performance of Richard III, I felt like Richard was what he claimed to be: deformed and unfinished.

In the famous seduction scene, Act 1 scene 2, Richard goes about attempting to seduce Lady Anne and two moments in particular struck me.

Duke of Gloucester. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband, Did it to help thee to a better husband.

Lady Anne. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

Duke of Gloucester. He lives that loves thee better than he could.

Lady Anne. Name him.

Duke of Gloucester. Plantagenet

Lady Anne. Why, that was he.

Duke of Gloucester.The selfsame name but one of better nature.

Lady Anne. Where is he?

Duke of Gloucester. Here.

[She spitteth at him]

*Why doest thou spit at me?* (My emphasis added)

I’ve seen that scene played by several extraordinary and well known actors, and while detracting nothing from their performances I was astounded at this moment in the Rylance performance. With the spittle dripping from his face Richard looks neither surprised nor outraged but rather asks why. Not as if not asking for justification, but as if wondering which aspect of himself was the reason for the abuse. In that moment in the performance I saw the cripple youngest brother with two favored royal older brothers. What must it have been like growing up in their shadows and only stepping out often enough to see his own twisted mockery of theirs?

This leads me to the second moment that struck me in the seduction scene and drove home the self loathing aspect of Richard.


Duke of Gloucester. 

	Was ever woman in this humor woo’d?

	Was ever woman in this humor won?

	I’ll have her...

In most productions of Richard III that I’ve seen and even in giving the line myself a certain cockiness is present as Richard brags to the audience of his powers of seduction. In this performance that cockiness was entirely absent. Richard was completely incredulous and actually waiting for members of the audience to start shaking their heads and giving him feedback. Then the moment, “I’ll have her!” was a shout bursting out with joy and given full force to echo among the galleries of the Globe as he realized that he’d actually succeeded.
Duke of Goucester.
	[...]
	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety? 
	On me, that halt and am unshapen thus? 
	My dukedom to a beggarly denier, 
	I do mistake my person all this while: 
	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, (emphasis added)
	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
	[...]
	In some ways, I feel that Rylance’s performance may actually be closer to the original intention of the script.

Let me reiterate -- copying shots means copying aesthetic *when they're done right*. The Psycho remake copies blocking and composition for many of the shots, but doesn't keep the same aesthetic, with a space that's less decrepit, more bright, more colorful, and has a particularly forced way of stringing together images like it's a slave to the original. Compare that to *Ready Player One*, which copies some shots for establishing purposes, but not all of them, and recreates carpet patterns, lighting and sets in a way that makes you immediately understand you're looking at the Overlook Hotel.  
Our disagreement comes from me defining ""copying aesthetic"" much more loosely than you do. Again, as I said earlier, I agree *Ready Player One* goes off into different, blunter directions when Aech leaves. I'm not arguing it's perfectly Kubrick or that it feels like it's lifted from *The Shining*. I'm just saying, they put a hell of a lot more effort into recreating the feel of a piece than most other shot-copying sequences. We may disagree on exact terminology, but I think we can at least agree the aesthetic is a whole lot more authentic than anything in something like the Psycho remake.",87yv63

To play into your really silly example: if the karate kid suddenly started shooting lasers out of his eyes at the end of the movie and blasted all the bad guys into bubblegum powder, you're right I'd have a problem with it.  I'd be like 'hey wtf, that doesn't make sense'.  And I imagine you'd jump up furious and red faced shouting 'OMG it isn't REAL LIFE! It's just a movie!!'.  And that would be just as stupid there as it is here.

Nobody's complaining about realism.  When I said a real world assassin, I was referring to someone who was outside the game world.  It seems you either misunderstood that or ignored it.  Anyway, I'm happy for any fiction to be fictional, fantasy to be fantastical, or narrative leaps for the sake of impact and drama.  That's all well and good...so long as it obeys the rules it created itself.  This movie does not. The movie built the tension of that trained assassin's attack on the premise of her being dangerous; that was the point.  Turns out she wasn't dangerous...at all.  Even remotely.  The whole point of her existence in the plot was that she was dangerous, she had only one scene in which to be dangerous and she was hilariously not dangerous.  A bunch of teenagers beat the shit out of her.

While I understand the sense of ownership sometimes, you also need to see that these directors have the mandate to make a good movie according to what they deem appropriate. It would be more productive to judge a movie on its merit, and it's ability to tell a good compelling story, rather than on its closeness to the source material. Doing the latter puts undue pressure on writers and directors and I for one, think this a big reason why some movie adaptations are often very terrible. 

Case in point, the walking dead series. I am one of those who think that following the comics as close as they did, instead of letting the show chart its own course was one of the biggest reasons the show started to suck. And I speculate that the writers came under pressure from comic book fans who felt following the comic to the letter was the best way because the comic was soo interesting.

This book this movie is adapted from is absolutely about 80s culture. You can’t worry that some people might not “get” all the references. 

> They can't afford to alienate part of the audience because they didn't 'get it’. 

Yes they can. If you’re going to adapt this book, that’s the risk you take. 

> If you have never played a video game in your life you could still enjoy this movie. 

But there was an Atari in it! How would those people appreciate the movie despite a reference they can’t understand! /s

> The reference like Gizmo's box doesn't change the film at all but made many(me included) grin just a little.

But it’s just fluff… whereas the 80s culture was an essential part of the book. ",87yv63

e5kgemp,">\> lol seems like you are incapable of reading and understanding my comment.

Uh, you don’t seem to understand how this works… do you? 

I directly responded to your comment with a follow-up question that directly addresses your comment, which implies I read and understood your comment.  

Your original comment, on the other hand, was incredibly ignorant towards the multitude of other comments that very specifically explain why other people didn’t like the movie, which implies you didn’t read or understand the other comments. 

See the difference?

>\>  I read the complaints and even agreed with some of them. 

OK, so why would you say *“I’m not sure why there is so much hate for this movie”* if you agree with the complaints? Shouldn’t you be able to comprehend why people didn’t care for the movie then, if you can empathize with what they disliked? Are you just being dense or pedantic? 

>\> But overall, I felt it was an enjoyable film with a few cliches that I could look over because they had several amazing scenes in the movie. 

The Phantom Menace had several amazing scenes too… but most people disliked it. Not really that different here.

>\> The starting race and how he figures out to get the first key. 

But that part was so dumb. Wade had to watch hours or IRL Twitch clips to find a totally random “clue” buried in a video of Halliday cleaning up after a party? It’s nonsensical at best, and downright absurd at worst if you spend two seconds thinking about it. I mean, how much of Haliday’s life is available to view? And Haliday made the race knowing he once said something after a party about gong backwards, and decided to make that one line from thousands of conversations he had with Morrow some hint about a video game race to control the entire OASIS? Honestly? I can't believe people just accept this lazy writing.

>\> The combination of 'The Shining' with other aspects to get the second key.

So the only reason this scene was good was because it completely “borrowed"" from a far superior movie? OK, I’ll agree to that one. 

>\>  The ending stuff with figuring out the final challenge. 

And the notion that a team of hired nerds couldn’t figure out the challenge doesn’t bother you at all? Or that IOI just magically knew to protect castle before our heroes arrive? Or the notion that Wade would be the only person in the OASIS capable of figuring out that things like ""keys"" and an ""easter egg"" would relate to the game Adventure in such a way?

>\> These scenes in particular stood out to me and made up for some uses of cliche in the film. 

And others disagreed with this sentiment. And that shouldn’t be difficult to understand, especially after they stated as much in comment after comment. 

Yes, it was pretty and fun, but shallow and hollow. Pretty much the repeated sentiment here. Shouldn’t be hard to understand why people didn’t like the movie. 

>\> So that's why I asked ""why is there so much hate for the movie"" because I genuinely enjoyed the movie. 

But people have very explicitly stated on this forum why they dislike the movie. Your answer is clearly there within this forum. In detail. Over and over and over again.   

>\> That's also why I added the point about not reading the books because that seems to have influenced people's decision. 

OK, so if you believe people who read the books might not have liked the movie, then doesn’t that answer your question? 

Besides, there are plenty of people who didn’t read the book who didn’t care for the movie for whatever reason. Shallow characters. Cartoony villains. Nonsensical plot. You name it. 

>\> So, maybe you should actually try to read my whole comment before acting out like a asshole. 

I did… all three whole lines of it!

Apologies if me calling you out makes you think I’m just out to be an asshole. You’re the one who’s seemingly ignorant to everyone’s opinion who didn’t like the movie, who already took the time to explain why on this exact forum, but I’m the asshole for calling you out on your ignorance? OK… 

>\> I feel like you are one of those people that watched Black Mirror and hated Season 4 just because it wasn't realistic enough or complained about some minor bullshit.

Black Mirror Season 4 was great… far better than the RPO movie was for sure. RPO had some very real issues, especially compared to other Spielberg films, so let’s not act like people are complaining about “some minor bullshit” when it comes to RPO.

dx7g6gn,"I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst kind. It had me entertained, and that was its purpose. The Last Jedi was an example of ideas that were overreaching and didn’t hit their mark, it tried to change things about the series. That’s a weird movie to bring up when talking about the “worst kind of nostalgia.” I’ve been a fan of Star Wars for such a long time and I felt kind of betrayed by that movie. Ready Player One wasn’t changing a beloved series, it simply referenced them.

I can agree that it was very hollow, and pretty soon the nostalgia is going to be overwhelming and people are going to get over it. 

But like I said, it kept me entertained. I watched it with my dad who grew up in the 80s, so it was cool to share that with him, ya know? That’s kind of what it was for I think. That’s what any of these movies are for in my opinion. They’re just there for fun. Nothing more, nothing less.",87yv63

It's not a simpleton's world, though some in media seem to be trying to convince us it is.

If you applied the same message to Citizen Kane (the last shot of the film applied to the entire film) then we'd never get to an understanding of Kane, we'd just be trapped in his childhood.

The games/puzzles in the film are multi-valent. Every task has a nostalgic aspect, an apparent layer, and then a part that avoids every possible association to nostalgia.

The first puzzle is the figurative example, he drives backwards, pretty easily, at a deeper level than nostalgia's references. He wins.

Each puzzle after this duplicates this two-aspect solution.

In fact, the point is to get to the real layer, each solution requires a present-day comprehension of WHY the nostalgia tanks and the connection between people regardless of their taste is essential.

GSS gets their money (a shitton of it) from selling ""virtual real estate"", microtransactions for teleporting, fuel, skins, etc., so presumably, they are throwing the original company some of that money.

However, the original company is not in a good bargaining position, as everybody in RPO world prefers OASIS to regular Internet access through desktop or phone or something, so if your product is not in OASIS, it might as well not exist.  
Imagine if someone today released a game for the first XBOX (or even X360). It would not sell well, because it is for old obsolete hardware that people do not want to use or no longer have. So developers are ""forced"" to develop for XBOX One, etc.

Also, GSS in the book are shown as pretty much the ""good guys"" of the corporate matchup, with respect and love for the games rather than for just making money, so they would probably not do that.

I'm not a fan of referencing old things for the sake of referencing old things. The writing around it also didn't do it for me. 

I get the premise, people playing games online and choosing to play as characters from other franchises. People do this with games that let you install mods. I can play Skyrim as Cloud Strife or Goku or whatever. But I don't sit there with my friends and go ""Hey, I'm Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy carrying his Buster Sword! Did you see Will? He was riding around in the Millenium Falcon from Star Wars! Do you wanna go back to my house? I have models of the Star Trek Enterprise, the Death Star, and the Galactica!"" 

I would've tolerated it if it only lasted a few minutes, but it went on for the entire movie. It felt like a checklist. No deeper reason for any of the references other than to ask you if you remembered that reference. Goro from MK shows up and a fucking baby Alien bursts out of his chest. Why? Who knows. 

The acting is phenomenal. The script is godawful, like it was written by someone who assumed how ""gamers"" and ""nerds"" talk to each other. I love old games but I don't call myself a fanboy that listens to Duran Duran while I play Robotoron, I don't talk or act like that. Despite that, the actors were fantastic in their acting and line delivery. Of course the visuals were stunning and it was fun to watch.

In general, the movie cut out a lot of world-building.  I assume that was mainly because it already was pretty heavy on voice-over narration, especially near the beginning, and explaining things like the school planet while also spending several scenes with Wade bored at school before finding the first challenge would have made the beginning extremely slow.

I think they could've made that movie, changed every character's name, made no attempt to connect it to the original outside of the *presence of a Death Note* in the story, and it might've been really interesting.

dww20cn,"Good point. But in the Star Wars RPG (with all the d6 rolling) tons of players wanted a YT-1300 freighter, but many wouldn't call it *Millennium Falcon* because there's only 1, and it's Han's/Lando's etc though there was a lot of unknown history of the ship. Or a Star Trek RPG you could be captain of a Constitution class, but not the *Enterprise*, because there's only 1 and it's not yours and its history is pretty much all set in stone (until JJ's movie). but having the YT-1300 or the Constitution class was still cool.

So, in OASIS how was this kind of thing handled? Can everyone who has enough coins get a Firefly-class called Serenity, or can there only be one ""Serenity"" but anyone can get a Firefly-class?  

If there are 218 Serenity's flying through the Black, it could get confusing. Or would it be ""Serenity_02"" and ""Serenity1989"" lameness? ;)",87yv63

As someone who loved the book (yet recognized its many flaws), I thoroughly enjoyed the movie because it kept the premise and worldbuilding but was completely different in terms of the actual narrative. On the off chance your mind isn't made up 23 days later, I would definitely read the book if you found the world of RP1 interesting. I personally feel like the book's pacing lent itself much better to the massive universe the OASIS is meant to be, and the structure of the final battle was much more interesting in the book in my opinion. With that said, I thought the truck ending in the movie was cute (and so is Olivia Cooke.)

Daito wanted to sell the capsule and split the profit, Shoto wanted to give it to Parzival who had found the quest, but Parzival wanted Daito and Shoto to keep the Capsule, seeing how Ultraman was a famous Japanese hero and that the Beta Capsule belonged in Japanese hands.

After Daito's demise, both digitally and physically, Shoto returned the capsule to Parzival, knowing that he would be able to exact vengeance on IOI. During the Battle of Castle Anorak, Shoto was killed by Nolan Sorrento piloting Mechagodzilla, prompting Parzival to activate the Beta Capsule and kill Sorrento's OASIS avatar.

dwiqmvf,"I don't mind the overall message - we have to fight for change. But the movie ruins it with that last line. It was an eye-roller.

Though if I were to tackle the wider scope of the issue, I'd like to point out the role of films during the Great Depression, which is particularly relevant in its parallels with the setting and timeline. The rise of movies was a saving grace for a devestated society - people still worked and suffered, but movies helped to make their lives worth it. It was an incredible form of escapism the likes of which had never been seen before, becoming a massive and essential pillar of our modern culture. There's plenty of articles on the subject.

The inherent problem in presenting the underlying societal conflict of the story in this film is that there's a serious lack of context. How are these people making enough of a living to enjoy the Oasis at all? The movie makes it appear as though lower-class (and even middle-class) labor had become centralized through virtual labor systems within the Oasis according to the debt pods, digital currency values, etc. We otherwise have nothing outside of the megacorp salary men.

Quick fix? Automation, VR-interface manual labor controls, basic income, and digital workspaces. No more menial labor for the masses, cheaper and superior civil infrastructure and housing through advanced labor machines, and everyone can live in healthy comfort in their living spaces while conducting the affairs of life, pleasure, and business through the digital sphere.

The ""solution"" present in the movie is just... juvenile. *However*, I acknowledge that this isn't supposed to be some great moralistic tale on the nature of society as much as it is a fun adventure romp and love letter to modern media culture. Thus I don't really have a big problem with the movie in that light, I just think it's silly to take it that seriously when it's not proposing *any* realistic solutions to rising societal problems, least of all such problems being cultural escapism.",87yv63

The quests weren't about the man's ego and how great he was. They were about his failures. Haliday failed when he forced his best friend out of the company and he failed to get the girl because of his fears.

Haliday was checking that the person who would take over the Oasis would be the right kind of person in a very Willy Wonka-esque fashion. Yes, he and Ogden left clues (as opposed to Wonka's trial-by-fire), but the person who ended up with the keys to the kingdom had to be a better person than Haliday.

dyc3vyk,"Depends on the film itself, Ready player one used narration as a cheap narrative method which basically was just used to explain the world which is very mediocre for a film that can easily be shown to the audience. I believe narration must be used throughout a film as an inner monologue that either expands the characters thoughts on the world or the character him/herself, In Ready player one this is used in a way to just explain the world to the audience, in this case he never added anything to it, he never added anything really that reflected his view of the world except for a few, vague, lines which made him a boring and dull character. A good use of narration would be something like the lobster which helps us understand the character from an external POV by the narrator, adding to the character himself and making him interesting, it's also used sparingly throughout the film and not just at the beginning and end. Another example would be the monologue of Gone Girl, which helps the audience understand her relationship with the main character which in turns adds to both characters, as we see her inner thoughts of how she's all planned this out within. Narration needs to add something over than world building, Imagine if Bladerunner 2049 had a narration at the start to explain the whole world, it would take away from the experience as a whole cause you're being spoon feed the world rather than allowing yourself to take it in at your own pace.

Your problem there is 'football' is a single thing.  But references could cover a MASSIVE range of stuff, I'm a kid of the 80's and 90's and I didn't get all the references in the book.  

Also, football movies don't cost 175M to make and 50 to 75M for advertisements. This is a business, they can't spend that level of money and alienate 70% of the audience.

""the 80s culture was an essential""

And that's why they changed(adapted) that for the movie. The '80's culture is a small market, they wanted a market that covered more then 1 decade 40 years ago. Teens aren't going to a '80's only themed movie. This is a business.

Yes you directly responded to my comment but that doesn't always imply you read the full comment. You could have easily read one sentence and fixated on that point without bothering to read on. And while this is probably unlikely in this case since my comment was only three lines you would surprised how many people do this.

And once again, my original comment was not ignorant of other people's own comments. I read through the discussion and found people equally liking and disliking this film. I read through their points and understood the points they were trying to make. And once again, these points didn't really bother me much because I liked the message the movie was trying to make and how the movie did this. I will go through this in my other points detailed below. Going through the page now, I see you have made quite a few comments agreeing with the people who hated the film and disagreeing with the people who liked the movie such as myself. You do realize that opinions can be subjective right. Just because you hate it, it doesn't mean it is bad.

>OK, so why would you say “I’m not sure why there is so much hate for this movie” if you agree with the >complaints? Shouldn’t you be able to comprehend why people didn’t care for the movie then, if you can >empathize with what they disliked? Are you just being dense or pedantic? 

Because these points didn't really bother me much because I liked the point the movie was trying to make and how the movie did this. His family dying and his reaction took me out of the world a lot. Also the whole relationship thing with the girl was so forced and cliched yes. I never said this was a masterpiece, merely that it was enjoyable and I had a good experience. And my comment was trying to gauge what in particular made people hate it or take them out of the movie. Didn't some of the set/action pieces reignite your excitement and curiosity.

>The Phantom Menace had several amazing scenes too… but most people disliked it. Not really that >different here.

It is very different because the amazing scenes actually overcome the cliches and low points of the movie. In the Phantom Menace they do not. The low points are really low that once you go past some of these points nothing in the movie can regain your interest. In movies such as phantom menace you can easily tell when something is happening because of the writers vs when the characters would logically make that move. And I felt that in Ready Player One most scenes were what the characters would logically take.

>But that part was so dumb. Wade had to watch hours or IRL Twitch clips to find a totally random “clue” >buried in a video of Halliday cleaning up after a party? It’s nonsensical at best, and downright absurd at >worst if you spend two seconds thinking about it. I mean, how much of Haliday’s life is available to >view?

Honestly? I can't believe people just accept this >lazy writing.

You just said it ""The hint was to control the entire OASIS"". Halliday wanted someone who had a similar passion for the OASIS, someone who understood his motivations of why he created the OASIS and what he wanted to achieve. Almost all of his life was archived because Halliday wanted the right person who would not only mimic his thinking but logically understand his reasoning. That was the whole point of the challenges. Yes, I accept that Wade watching the right video after scouring through like thousands of archived videos in the last 5 years seems unrealistic but you have to remember they previously showed how much of Halliday's personalities and hobbies Wade knows. So while unrealistic, it really wasn't enough to take me out of the movie.

>So the only reason this scene was good was because it completely “borrowed"" from a far superior >movie? OK, I’ll agree to that one. 

If you expect every movie to have original ideas I'm afraid you are sorely mistaken. There's a reason why cliches have become known as cliches over the years. Sometimes, screenwriters have to force these things to happen to get their point across. If done right, it doesn't heavily change your perception of the movie. If done wrong, as it is done in countless cases, the movies perception heavily suffers. And it didn't borrow the scene. It adapted it and made it into it's own version that fit within the universe. Is it that hard to imagine that in VR, things that already exist will be immediately adapted into the world, especially things that have a cult following.

>And the notion that a team of hired nerds couldn’t figure out the challenge doesn’t bother you at all? Or >that IOI just magically knew to protect castle before our heroes arrive? Or the notion that Wade would >be the only person in the OASIS capable of figuring out that things like ""keys"" and an ""easter egg"" >would relate to the game Adventure in such a way?

No. It doesn't bother me because it shows that those were clearly the wrong types of people to take control of the OASIS. IOI knew to put up the protection so they could get unlimited access to the third challenge without interruptions. 

Also again, Wade was the first one to find the first key. He told his group of friends how to get it. The better question is why didn't any other people, who saw those racers going backwards at the first challenge, copy them to get the first key themselves? I have no idea. Anyway only people who get the first key get the next hints. They were the only ones who got the second key and hints as well. IOI figured out the third challenge when it become available in the castle and immediately locked the place down knowing it was of significance.

Your other points are basically repeating various stuff I already covered. I am not ignorant of other people's beliefs as I read all their comments. I also read the comments about people liking the movie and agreed with them more. I also apologize for calling you an asshole. You clearly have used the facts to support your opinion the movie was shit whereas I have used other facts to show how it is not that bad.

dx7j0dm,"> Ready Player One wasn’t changing a beloved series, it simply referenced them.

It didn't though, that's exactly the thing. The Iron Giant is an excellent example of that. It didn't 'just' reference it, it twisted it to something it wasn't, into something *less*, simply the name of 'cool.' Do you think Steven Spielberg even cared for any of the things put in the movie? It was so shamelessly commercial with all the recent references. When they went into the 'skin shop' that became so glaringly obvious; ""look at all these things you can spend money on in real life!"" It was pure product placement, it made me feel icky.

Anyway, yeah I can't deny that it's purpose was to entertain. Absolutely, you're right. But that doesn't make it good art. And don't get me wrong, I can be plenty entertained by bad art. I'd never defend 1982's Conan The Barbarian as good art. But lord do I love it. Hell, I'm one of those 'terrible movie fans', y'know The Room, Birdemic, all that trash. I'd never call them good art though.

You know what I will say though? Those movies I listed all had a *heart.* Sometimes twisted, plenty times ugly, but heart nonetheless. Ready Player One lacked any of that. And it's not like I'm saying you're 'wrong' for liking it. I mean shit I too was plenty entertained by it. But just because I was entertained I won't defend it or try to justify its vapidity. I just can't imagine why people think what a movie this cynical and empty does is... enough. Why people aren't more discerning. I dunno man, it's frustrating to see films like this succeed and see films like Annihilation bomb.

As for The Last Jedi, that's exactly why I said that we can discuss how well it executed its ideas as it's irrelevant for my point. Because my point is that at least it *had* ideas, it wanted to do something with its source material, it had something to *say.* I sure as hell agree that not all of it hit its mark, but by jove did it at least try. That's why I mentioned it, not so weird to do so in that context I'd reckon. It had artistic ideas about nostalgia, even if those ideas culminated in rejection. Ready Player One just *exploited* nostalgia, that's why I call that the worst kind of nostalgia over TLJ.

I do definitely disagree with the implication that trying to change things about the series is a bad idea. I don't understand such traditionalism, such conservatism in the literal sense of the word. Yeah sure the known is very comfortable, but in the long run to stand still is to go backwards. If Star Wars would never change, would always stay the same, work through the same dynamics it'd just slowly hollow out and die from artistic ennui. I'm definitely not sure Star Wars is going in the right direction, but it at least it has the balls to *go* somewhere. Like, do you have an idea what Episode IX is going to be? I sure don't! And that's incredibly exciting to me. The idea that changing a franchise is bad... That's just asking for cultural death yo.",87yv63

dx4nkqd,"I honestly don't think my view is the simpleton's take. On the contrary, I think the movie was created to impress simpletons, and that's my main problem with it. Yes I did reduce the message down to the simplest form, but that was for brevity's sake really, and I went on the extreme side to make a point.

Part of the same coin though, if I was oversimplifying, I believe you are giving way more credit to the filmmakers than is deserved. I have a problem with metaphors without narrative fusion. Driving backwards is an example of this: where the metaphor is perfectly fine to use, and one can track it, but it isn't tied into the logic of the world you've built. No race that had $500 billion at the finish line, set in a worldwide online gaming community, would survive for five years without someone driving backwards. That metaphor does not fit within the construct of the world they built. It doesn't align with what we know about video games. It's just a metaphor that stands on its own, one without any ties to the narrative. They wrote the metaphor first and created a house of cards around it to hold it up. It doesn't work for me.

As for the message at the end of the film, what do you think it was? In my mind, the world is still a really terrible place to live, but he has everything he wanted, so why not shut down the one escape for people from their shitty, smog-filled lives for two days a week? Even further, some people's way of making an income is in the Oasis, so why not shut that down? Isn't that the shortsightedness of the super elite, who think they are helping the commoners whom they have forgotten about as soon as they finally get to their high rise loft? I don't want that to be the message I take, I agree that its ridiculous to take the message of the last shot of any film and apply it to the whole film, but its what they showed me. It was out of nowhere and it shouldn't have been.  What am I supposed to understand about the nature of his life now and what he values?

dx9gx76,"> You want me to stop comparing the book to the movie, which is supposed to be the basis of the movie?

The key word is 'basis'. And you should NEVER compare books and movies. A simple rule is for ever minute of movie it's a 1 page a screen play. So that's give or take the movie at 120 pages to the books 385. Would you seriously compare a long distance runner who ran for 120 minutes and the distance he got against someone distance who get to run for 385 minutes? Not really fair is it?

You have to know going into a movie that has to cut two thirds the books content it not going to be as deep or the same. If you were expecting it to be as deep as the book you were ALWAYS going to be disappointed.

""The curator isn’t just any guy, that was Ogden Morrow, the partner who Halliday pushed away.""

Yes I know that. And that proves just how much knowledge Wade had of Holliday, he know something even Morrow didn't know. That is character development.

In the confines of a movie how do you add 'character development'? Better question what do you take out to add character development? There is not a lot of useless time in the movie.

Now, I'll admit that *John Wick* does a helluva lot better job in making these plot points more natural feeling than *RPO*. I definitely think that *John Wick* was a much more stylized piece of filmmaking and didn't have as many 'rules' to the world that *RPO* had to adhere to due to complexity of the Oasis world it was set in.

dx17g6j,"To start off, I would like to say that the film is a complete reference bait of a cinematic product. The team simply decided to spam as many pop culture references into it as possible. As Barry Hertz put it, “it is less a film and more an overstuffed cultural recycling bin.” They are also completely incoherent and provide nothing to the film, other than eye candy. Adding  a menace of contemporary references did not help. Most forty year olds who come to the film for Joy Division, The Breakfast Club, The Shining, Atari, NES, Pac-Man, etc. have no idea who Tracer from Overwatch, Sans from Undertale, or Master Chief from Halo is. The children who then comes for the latter, have no idea what the former are, making it a movie with a very confused target audience. Wasn't The Iron Giant a film against violence? Why is the robot now acting like Liberty Prime from the Fallout series?

Like the book, the film's screenplay is as bad as it gets. The dialog is not only very cheesy at times, but not like anything an actual human being would ever utter. Pair that with a rushed cliché love story which seems more like a misogynistic trophy hunt than anything else, and you have got a pretty bad start already. The main character also acts completely braindead at times, while all the somewhat interesting characters do all the work. The villain, by the way, acts nothing like a villain would, he poses no threat, and all his “Halliday historians” rejoice when Parzival wins, when they in reality should mourn their unemployment.

Another thing would be when Anorek tests Parzival with a contract which he refuses to sign, only to be completely on board with seemingly the same one, five minutes later.

To add to all this, the story really does not make any sense and has no real world consequences. Why on earth does no one bat an eye when a large corporation resorts to domestic terrorism to win a game, but when a single man is in possesion of a weapon, five police vehicles show up to arrest him. In the same scene a girl with an anarchist sign gladly cooperates with the police.

That they had the brilliant idea of changing most of the plot from the book was probably for the best, however they somehow made it alot worse. Consider the first easter egg for example. Isn't going backwards, the first thing people try in a racing game?

Pacing is another issue with this film. In the book, Parzival plans for multiple months how to stop Sorrento and the Sixers from winning, while the film finishes it in what seems like three days.
And why does all the best egg hunters conveniently live in the same city? The book did at least have them live in different countries, which would make more sense both statistically and plot wise.
The ending's extra life scene is a huge deus ex machina, by the way, and the way they try to tell the children to not use the internet so much is ridiculous. Like anyone actually changed their minds after that.

They don't have a fundamental right to use the Oasis for free. 2. ""because listening to loud music on a consistent basis will give me tinnitus or something"" The point of shouting it down 2 days isn't in anyway to protect people from something bad, it's more the idea 'everything in moderation'. The Oasis is good but don't spend every waking second there. Go out and get a life.

I think your missing my point. The movie makes it clear the Oasis is popular because it helps people escape from a shitty world NOT because people really enjoy it. There is a difference in entertainment and escaping real world problems. If like you hypothetical scenario people went just because it was fun or they like it then it would be different then hiding from your problems. Just hiding from your problem and ignoring them is never a good idea and that is exactly what the Oasis is doing.

In Oasis it's different, because it's not a part of any actual continuity. Owning the Millennium Falcon doesn't make any hard to explain errors because it's just for show, even if 1,000 other people also own the same ship. 

Although, as a side note, players would *definitely* want/demand the Millennium Falcon/Serenity in their respective games. I've been DMing since I was in middle school(in my 30s) and it's usually my job to explain to players things like why having the Millennium Falcon doesn't make sense in the setting, but they are perfectly welcome to owning a YT-1300 and if it so happens they want to call it the Millennium Falcon they are welcome to doing so.

It comes down to appreciating that compressing the timescale weakened the protagonist’s relationships and pacing of the film, no matter what their “good intentions” were.

Sure. The dire wolves are all but removed from the Game of Thrones television show, and while it makes for a weaker show, I’m sure they had “solid filmmaking reasons” for doing so.

Exactly! It took FIVE YEARS for the first clue to be cracked, and the second and third clues, together, took like a day.  Can’t you see a problem with pacing there? And how exactly did IOI figure out the third clue out of the blue? 

It made for downright awful pacing, and it’s the fault of the compressed timeline.

I'm a month late but I agree. In the book the challenges themselves were never the holdup. After a challenge was found it was beaten almost immediately. The players beat them honestly while IOI cheated. What always kept IOI in check were the clues. The clues were so hard to solve it took the main characters months or I think even over a year sometimes to solve one. The last challenge also had an easter egg of its own which would never have been found by IOI. Wayde was the only one who found it as he just loved that time period and nerded out. That love/nerding out revealed a critical clue which was completely absent from the movie.

I felt like Wade winning a bet about Halliday with the curator to get the quarter -- especially considering the curator is Morrow, basically the only person Halliday was ever close to, and who knew him intimately for decades -- is a lot less contrived than Wade somehow getting a perfect score in Pacman. In a matter of hours. On an irrelevant planet. While messages are popping up on his HUD about the sixers closing in on the 2nd gate.

A perfect score in Pacman has only been accomplished around 20 times to date, ever. And those were all by people who probably put in thousands of attempts.

I will say though, about the movie, Morrow as the curator really only makes sense if he only did it specifically for Wade once Wade got the first key. Otherwise, considering how popular the Halliday memory archive is said to have been in the first year or two, there's no way Morrow could have handled that job by himself. Especially since it's presumably a full-time job at minimum, possibly a 24-7 job. The movie seemed to imply Morrow *was* the curator, period.

Have you not read the chapter in question? I think those who have read it wouldn’t have an issue understanding. 

Z feels like he’s communicating with Haliday, his idol, as he interacts with the Lich. 

There’s some fun dialogue between Z and the Lich, as Z inquires about the parameters of the copper key. 

There’s the visual of an undead Lich playing an arcade game with someone in medieval armor. 

And watching people play video games can certainly be entertaining. In fact, there’s this billion dollar company called Twitch that is just hundreds of thousands of people choosing to watch other people play video games. People ARE entertained by watching others play video games.

And did not knowing all the references ruin the book for you? Of course not. 

Spielberg certainly does not need to pander to audiences to make a solid movie. 



> Also, football movies don't cost 175M to make and 50 to 75M for advertisements. 

Wait, are you implying that Spielberg is currently making movies, including this one, as some profit-driven business venture as opposed to creating films that he’s interested in making? Spielberg? Seriously? 

> This is a business, they can't spend that level of money and alienate 70% of the audience.

I love the purely random numbers here. Nothing quite like the ol' like “well, I’ll just invent numbers to support my argument!”

> Well, obviously not. They did. You do know 'adapt means 'change’.

More like “alter a little from an original work to better fit a different medium”… not “completely dumb down the original story so that the lowest common denominator can tune out and just count how many CGI easter eggs they can see.”

I mean, imagine if Spielberg had decided to take your approach when he adapted Schindler’s List… sure glad he did not. 

> Because, Wade literally narrates that scene. Are you have him do this ALL the movie? Once works, but more then that would be bad movie making.

You’re absolutely right… all that narrating really brings down a movie like Shawshank Redemption. /s

Besides, Wade narrates WAY more than once throughout the movie, but apparently it works just fine since you didn’t even notice it. So clearly narrating certain scenes isn’t as “bad” as you claim it would be. 

> Not sure you remember the book all that much. How many references were truly essential? 

Are you asking because you don’t know? And you’re trying to give me guff about not knowing? Cute. 

The first key relies on D&D knowledge (1) and the ability to play Joust (2), with the first gate referencing a PC game (3), an 80s computer (4) and the War Games movie (5). 

The second key relies on hacking knowledge (6) and Zork (7), with the second gate requiring knowledge of Bladerunner (8) and Black Tiger (9).

The third key requires Rush info (10), knowledge on Haliday’s games (11), Schoolhouse Rock knowledge (12) with the final gate requiring experience with Tempest (13), Monty Python (14) and Adventure (15.)

So there’s at least fifteen essential culture references in the movie, compared to two (The Shining and Adventure) in the movie. Big difference. 

> The book lists hundreds of references(like the movie), only about 6 maybe 7 were references were essential.

6 or 7? Sounds like you’re the one who should freshen up on your RPO book knowledge. 

> And that's why they changed(adapted) that for the movie. The '80's culture is a small market, they wanted a market that covered more then 1 decade 40 years ago.

TIL the 80s was 40 years ago. /s

Seriously though… there are twenty-somethings that were born in the 80s… try not to be so dramatic.

The length of this conversation is starting to outweigh my interest in it, so I’m going to sum up and bid you a good day. 

RPO wasn’t a great movie, and was arguably even a good one. It sits at 64 on Metacritic, which is a pretty average score, and is certainly a low score for a Spielberg movie. Some people enjoyed it, and some people didn’t. 

And I can easily understand both sides because I’ve read the comments on here which explain both camps. 

The very evident issues with the movie bothered some people to the point where they didn’t enjoy the movie, but others either weren’t bothered by those issue, or felt the enjoyment had by the CGI/action/easter eggs outweighed it. 

And that’s understandable. 

What I don’t understand is how someone can *“I'm not sure why there is so much hate here for the movie. “* when on a forum that contains several comments from both sides. The comments are very self-explanatory, and explain exactly why people didn’t like the movie. 

I don’t care what side of the fence you’re on… I do care that you claim you can’t understand the opposite perspective despite them spelling it out on this forum. ",87yv63

dx735q6,"Of COURSE the 'driving backwards' metaphor is tied to the narrative. The puzzles are in reverse (when they 'actually' occurred in real time outside the OASIS). The whole film aims backwards, towards that final childhood bedroom of Halliday's, which is BOTH in the past (figuratively) and the future (the end of the film.)

You're just not paying enough attention. And I think a majority of viewers are simply not visually literate, and that means, allowing the visuals precedence over the dialogue driven plot. Most of the clues are visual and they're not mentioned in dialogue. That's how you can easily dismiss 'driving backwards', because nobody was there to lecture you about the order the puzzles occurred in Halliday's real-life.

Sorry, you don't comprehend the complexities of film, and Spielberg is a master if the medium. You're trying to simplify an (in your case) unbelievably complex film.

Add to that is Spielberg's hilarious satire of gaming (the transitions and transactions within games and between them in OASIS), the internet (OASIS's data collection, creation and databases - notice how IOI has to work under  Halliday's rules?) and VR (how the Avatars all change over time - miss that? I thought so).

No film with this complexity is readable from it's last scene, nor is it visible in one viewing.

All I can suggest is see the film again and ask yourself if you remembered anything differently.

Good luck!

If I showed up to a museum to my wife and I's best mutual friend but my wife was only mentioned once I would probably notice.

The movie blew it, it skipped past all the important parts of the book, and added a bunch of lame stuff.

Skipped oasis being a place of work and play. Skipped high school. Didn't show how poor Wade was in OASIS. Skipped Irok being in HS, Skipped the challenges. Added the Shining for no reason.

I'm honestly confused how you can call the movies story line cringe but not the book. The movie made the core story better. The clues in the movie were life lessons he wanted the winner to learn compared to just knowledge on what pop culture stuff Halliday liked. The movie actually gives Art3mis a worthy backstory(I wasn't a fan of her leading a rebellion) but her wanting to end IOI was far better then her feed the world motivation in the book. And best of all made Wade more 'real', in the book Wade(apart from speaking to girls) could do almost anything, but in the movie he was good but still needed help doing some stuff.

Remember that old figure of speech “to assume makes an ass out of you and me”?

I just don’t like Michael Bay style explosturbation movies and I had higher hopes for Ready Player One. Am I a criminal for feeling this way?

I was born in ‘95 and I like to video game til my eyes bleed.

Stop trying to stereotype people based on their taste in movies, music, or anything superficial—you’re not doing a very good job. I just disagree with you, it’s nothing personal.

I don’t like being fed dumbed down fluff by Hollywood. It’s patronizing and lowers the bar for quality entertainment. I’d have expected this from Transformers, but I always thought of Ready Player One as a nerdy story for nerds composed by a nerd. 

Zak Penn is a famous Hollywood ghostwriter and I’m sure he had a hand in what happened to this story. His job is to make stuff appealing to a mainstream audience. The people who believe Cline wrote the screenplay by himself probably think a man named Richard Bachman wrote “The Running Man” instead of Stephen King.

I think they sacrificed a lot of the story’s nerd appeal so they could sell more tickets, and I’m obviously correct because the mainstream clearly disagrees with me vehemently even though all of the plot differences I pointed out were accurate. 

They cut out the Dungeons and Dragons references, the Atari ones, Back to the Future, War Games, Zork, Blade Runner, Rush, Tempest, Monty Python, and a litany of other things that gamer nerds like and other people don’t. 

They basically denerdified it so everyone could buy a ticket and enjoy some colorful explosions and loud noises. That makes me unhappy. Sorry for being a nerd.

It’s not that the Shining scene wasn’t awesome, or the special effects weren’t great. I loved the race part and thought that the animation of Anorak’s keys was superb visual chocolate. 

But it is that the Shining is a lot more iconic than War Games with Matthew Broderick and would draw a much bigger reaction from the audience. You even mentioned the Shining scene at one point in your comments, it obviously worked. 

It is that they sold out and dumbed down an intricate story so they could widen its appeal. I’m not trying to say RP1 was a Moby Dick, but I really enjoyed that book and think it could have been made into a movie that was great, not just good.

I even said (if you cared to read) in an earlier comment that I liked the movie as a separate entity from the book. It just glossed over the juicy dystopian intellectualism of the original, which was something I found very refreshing in an age of Cardi B and Donald Trump. Been to the movies lately? I just don’t dig what Hollywood is on right now. Sue me.

There aren’t enough brainy entertaining things being produced at the moment in mainstream USA because it’s cool to act like a retard right now. You’re entitled to disagree but don’t be an asshole just because I am not a fan of the movie compared to the book. I wouldn’t have even disliked the movie if they had retitled it or somehow indicated that it was a loose adaptation. I don’t know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, I didn’t get it. 

Keep the downvotes coming so you can preserve your echo chamber.

Anyway, I fit squarely into the target demographic for RP1, I’m just literate enough to be familiar with 20th century popular culture.

That pacing turns it into a race against time. They have to figure them out before IOI does because they have huge resources behind it. And the point about that five year period in the film was to stress how people had given up on it thinking it was impossible. Parsival cracking the first key meant the race was suddenly back on again.

I'm sorry, I believe you give the audience a choose between Wade in armor talking to a Lich then playing a 2d Joust or a well shoot balls to the wall super race, I(and Spielberg) think they choose the race overwhelming.

You also forget time. Book haves time to set up the dungeon and how he gets their, the race is one of the first things that happens. Something that REALLY wouldn't work is the Lich and Joust with no context. The context needed to get the Lich thing to work is time the movie just didn't have.

I just finished the book. How can you write that sentence and then not take that logic and put it to RPO?

1. You at one point talked about they added a 'Mario Cart' race and skipped the dungeon of dangers. This point more then most goes back to you own sentence ""different mediums"", watching Z skip and avoid all the bad stuff in a dungeon is FAR less visuals appealing then the race.

2. You talk about Sho and Daito 'backstory' and they hangout at Aech's hide-out. Do you mean side story not backstory? Because they had zero backstory in the book. And they never hung out at Aechs hide-out. The only time Sho and Daito(together) were at Aech's hide-out was when Z told everyone about how IOI tried to kill him. But back to the movie, telling the side story of Daito dying would need 20+ minutes of screen time to tell.........time this movie didn't have.

You have to be delusional if you don't think that the author is not an incel even after reading that. The only thing that author ever talks about in the book relating to females is about the looks of them. The first reaction the main character has to find that Aech is a girl is him commenting about her ""large bosom"". The author literally has the female characters stripped down to be only about their looks.

Not only that but the book uses homophobic slurs and have a stereotypically racist portrayal of both the Japanese characters. So you can add both homophobic and racist to the list. Neither of these are opinions either. The book literally has the characters saying homophobic things.

Then it showed it a *really* bad way, because nobody rose above anything, they survived on bad deus ex machina and the same feel good plot holes used in most kids movies. 

I *know* what they're focusing on in the movie, pop culture references and graphics. The plot itself feels like a hallmark movie, which people love hallmark movies, but I don't. 

That's the issue here. You're trying to explain why it's a good plot, I'm not going to agree, because no amount of pop culture references are saving that hallmark movie plot. 

It's not that it wasn't bleak, it's just that I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened, the ending was telegraphed from days away, everything was rushed, the dialogue was corny, the characters were bland and the villain was ridiculous. 

It could have been really good, but it went for the lowest common denominator and I just hated it (I also knew nothing about it before I went to see it).

No it not. The Oasis is a company owned product. They can choose when you can use it, people don't have a fundamental right to use others properties just because they want to. Chick-fil-a is a company that isn't open on Sundays, you think that's not right?

They are not paying ????(I can't remember the companies name who owns the Oasis) to buy that equipment. Wade got his suit from IOI, not the Oasis company. As far as movie said the Oasis access was free.

I think your ultimately missing the point and you believe they are there because they enjoy it. IF the movie was set in a normal world and people choose to go there for fun and entertainment that would be a different story. BUT the movie straight states in that future people go to escape a shitty world and not face their problems. Escaping and hiding from your problems is just not a good thing. Have 2 days a week to face your problems and not run away from them might actually make their world better. If everyone just escapes into the Oasis their world would never get fixed.

Again, you’re missing the point. You absolutely CAN have a passage of time within a movie that helps to reinforce relationships. 

Let’s look at Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. It does not take place over two days, and it does not suffer AT ALL because it takes longer than that… in fact, one could argue it is a stronger movie because it takes place over an extended period of time, which helps Indy form genuine relationships with the characters he meets, and makes it feel more like an adventure (instead of a quick romp.)


> In the books Frodo has the ring for like 20 years before Gandalf sets him on his quest to destroy it.

But they didn’t have Frodo go from the Shire to Mt. Doom in two days… which is exactly what they did in the Ready Player One movie. 

> That pacing turns it into a race against time. They have to figure them out before IOI does because they have huge resources behind it. And the point about that five year period in the film was to stress how people had given up on it thinking it was impossible. Parsival cracking the first key meant the race was suddenly back on again.

None of that makes any sense though. 

IOI wasn’t able to figure anything out in the first five years, but magically get the answers for the third challenge despite not having completed either of the first two challenges? And I’m glad you bring up the IOI team, because they’re so incompetent that they can’t figure out Haliday’s Easter Egg is in reference to Adventure inventing the Easter Egg, but somehow hacked the final location? 

If you take a minute to think about it, it’s absurd. 

Z only figures out the first clue because he watched a bunch of IRL Twitch clips of Haliday. Absolutely nothing to do with the culture Haliday loved… just discovered the “trick” while watching a video. They all tell one person, and five people get the first key. 

Then they get a second key like a day later, based on Haliday’s failed love life. At least this one required some sort of knowledge from pop culture from Haliday’s past. 

Then IOI is magically at the third challenge already, inside the castle. 

It makes zero sense. 

> Nah. They wanted to inject urgency into the film. Films are a very different medium to books and have very different demands. You might not like the changes but you can't say they didn't work.

I most certainly can say they didn’t work… in fact, that’s the crux of my argument. You seem to be (wrongly) implying that rushing a story along is ALWAYS for the best. But it isn’t. Not when you’re trying to set up an unforced romantic relationship, and not when you’re trying to set up a grand adventure. 

The Raiders of the Lost Ark would not be any better if they decided to “inject urgency into the film” by making it take place over a span of two days. Nor would Lord of the Rings. These films are about grand journeys… not compressed tasks. 


> And look at Valerian. people aren't dazzled by CGI if the film is dramatically crap.

Most movie goers on Rotten Tomatoes liked Valerian though… you’re kind of backing up my argument here. 

Yes, RPO scored higher, but I imagine if Valerian had a full-sized Iron Giant, a Delorian, and like a hundred other pop culture references from the 80s and 90s, it probably would have done a lot better.

""cut out practically all character development""

Maybe you got more out of the book then I did, but there wasn't a lot of character development in the book either. Aech, Arty, Daito, Shoto, and Sorrento have little to no development. Damn I know more about Kira Underwood who is dead then we learn about Samantha and Sorrento. Past Wade and the creators of the Oasis who really has good character development?

I guess I see why there is little character development, you factor in the key plot point that need to be there: intrudes Wade, lean about the oasis, learn about the contest and Halliday, IOI, the 1st challenge, solving the 1st challenge, IOI tries to kill Wade, 2nd challenge, solving 2nd challenge, and the final battle and Wade winning.

And not every movie has to be pandered down so that everyone enjoys it. Some of the best movies that exist today simply “aren’t for everybody”… and it’s because they weren’t dumbed down that they are considered great movies. 

> Wow, you can't count all those. 

They are all references, so I certainly can. 

> ('80s computer' is knowledge not a reference, 

It’s a reference to the birth/early life of personal computers and video games. Absolutely a reference. 

> 'hacking knowledge' how is that a reference?

How is that not a reference? It’s a specific call back to a famous event that occurred in the past… that’s literally the definition of a reference. 

> 'Haliday’s games' that's a made up thing not a reference. 

It’s a reference for Z, absolutely. And it was needed for him to find the Easter Egg. But I can thrown you a bone and not count it if it’s really so important to you.   

> Second I'm not sure you know what a reference is. A movie/game 'reference' isn't an entire movie, it's a small thing from that movie. 

That’s a single, specific definition, but it doesn’t magically eliminate the other definitions of “reference.” I’m not going to be that guy to post the definitions here… you can either look them up yourself or remain ignorant to what the term means… no skin off my back either way. 

That said, if I mention The Breakfast Club, that is absolutely a reference to/from the 80s. 

> Knowing the 'three is the magic number' is a single song from the show Schoolhouse Rock IS a reference. Have complete knowledge of a movie(War Games) is NOT a reference, but the line ""Would you like to play a game"" is a reference. Very specifically the game Advantage, in itself it's NOT a reference but the easter egg inside the game it is.

Schoolhouse Rock IS a reference to the 80s. War Games IS a reference to the 80s. Not sure what the game “Advantage” is, but the game Adventure IS a reference to the 80s. 

Just sounds like you're taking a specific meaning of “reference” and, for some reason, ignoring its overall meaning. Yes, what you’re referring to is considered a reference in a very specific sense. But, again, a movie or band or video game absolutely can certainly be a reference to the past. 

> And none of them remember the 80's. No one under 30 has real experience with pop culture of the '80's. Kids born in '88 or '89, were 1 or 2 in the '80's. Damn most of them don't remember most of the '90's. And look it up what age demographic makes up the big percentage of movie goiers??? That's right, teens and 20 something's, all have little to no knowledge of the '80’s.

I can’t believe I have to spell this out for you: the entire premise of Ready Player One revolves around teenagers learning about a culture THAT THEY AREN’T FAMILIAR WITH AND EMBRACE. That’s the WHOLE PREMISE OF THE STORY. Z drives a car from movies that existed BEFORE HE WAS BORN. Artemis drives a vehicle that exists BEFORE SHE WAS BORN. Aech is making a robot from BEFORE SHE WAS BORN. They go into The Shining. They play Adventure. 

The movie is literally about teenagers embracing culture from the past! 

> Yes, Spielberg. He is a business man. You think he does this to lose money? Why do you think there were so many references to thing in current pop culture in the movie. He was appling to a mass audience. Not 1 demo.

You should do a little research on the subject and read the Entertainment Weekly article on the movie. He actually REMOVED several pop culture references because he didn’t want the movie to be bogged down with them. 

So no, I do not buy this notion that he personally was cramming in references to push the profit margin. 

> I get you liked the book, but lets not kid ourselves the story in the book was weak. 

I’m not saying the book is perfect… merely that it was a bestseller (and therefore there was already a very large and interested market in the source material.)

> The clue in the movie were far better for story. 

The first clue in the movie was downright absurd, as it revolved around watching YouTube clips of Haliday’s life (like cleaning up after a party!)

> The books clues were just test of MASSIVELY small nerd trivia from the '80's. The movie tying in a lesson into the clue, Halliday's regrets about his friend and the girl that got away. In the movie Halliday wanted the winner to learn a lesson and not make his past mistakes. The book just wanted to have knowledge of the stuff Halliday liked as a kid, not sure that's great story telling.

What are you talking about? The movie clearly pulled those themes from the book, but made them overly “in your face” for the movie.  

You should probably go back and read the book again. Seemed pretty clear that Haliday rigged the challenge to force the Gunters to work together (form relationships) when he required three keys to proceed… something that simply did not happen in the movies. 

You’re also conveniently ignoring the fact that in the book Z and Og have conversations about Haliday, where it was pretty clear Haliday regretted his past with Kira and Ogden. Yes, it was portrayed in a more “in your face” approach in the movie, as Haliday practically narrated it directly to the audience, but it was certainly a theme in the book when Ogden spoke about Kira. 

Also, having her name be the final password in the book is a PRETTY BIG nod toward that theme. 


> I for the most part liked the book, but the book had many many flaws. 

Totally agree. 

> Things that were likely impossible, making the main character a male 'Mary Sue', only having 5 teens and IOI after the egg, and making IOI an stereotypic evil company just to name a few. The movie did the best with what it had to work with.

The movie did not “do the best” with what it had to work with. The story became far more nonsensical (cryptic clues hidden within Haliday YouTube clips of his past?), IOI devolved into an incompetent band of cartoony villains in the movie (why is Sorrento taking the OASIS visor off a six-foot tall black guy when he’s looking for a small white girl?), and it lacked any sense of logical progression (did IOI just jump straight to the last key/gate without doing anything else previously in the movie? And then they couldn’t figure out that Adventure was the game to play despite having a team of people focussed on finding an “Easter Egg”?)

What you're saying isn't really new.  Obv the assassin played by TJ miller is just some loser like the one in Make Love NOt Warcraft(another work that had this exact thing).  You still have yet to prove though why me not necessarily thinking that Halliday is autistic matters and makes me some sort of mindless zombie watching the movie.  I'm arguing Halliday being autistic or not autistic doesn't matter cause it's not about an autistic game designer it's about someone who never fully lived his life.  You're just regurgitating the movie's central theme.  I was arguing that ultimately there is nothing to indicate that the oasis won't return to this because in large part nothing has changed.  The same people using the Oasis to create their fabricated lives are still going to escape their real lives and real problems to live out their fantasies in the Oasis.  So i guess color me confused as to what you're trying to even say at this point/,87yv63

In the very first challenge in the books a fight with the IOI involved the Gunter clans dropping some nukes. Those clan members would never be scared of driving full speed at a wall if it had even the slightest chance of getting them ahead of everyone else in the race to get the egg.,87yv63

dxc3o0o,"The movie could do all of the things in the book fairly easily. This was not a hard one to translate to film.

1. High school was important because it showed the OASIS was not just a game or online service, but an actual useful world people did business in and learned in. It can fit in a movie; most movies involving a high school can establish a school scene in the first act. See: every movie that takes place in high school.
2. In the race scene he had to hang back to grab coins. He wasn't so poor that he couldn't travel anywhere, do anything, or play any sort of game/combat. Heck, he drove a BTTF Delorean.
3. Skipping Irok being in their high school misses the idea of there being any sort of honor/trust among gamers. 
4. it skipped the challenge of finding the initial dungeon, and changed challenge from a dungeon of dangers to a mario kart sequence race. It skipped the challenge of having to know anything about a movie, and instead made it wandering around a movie before finding an unrelated room. It skipped the last trial requiring teamwork. All of those would have worked on screen.
5. My issue with the quarter issue didn't relate as much to how he got it as to how it was introduced. there was no ""hmm, wonder what this is"". It was just a chance gift. They essentially made a checkhov's gun into a deus ex machine. He could have chosen it as a prize for winning a trial, thinking that just like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the smallest prize is the most powerful, and leaving people wondering what it would do.
6. The avatars did not look like anything resembling a main character IMO, and were a little cringe (except Irok's was pretty funny). Artemis especially did not look like a great warrior.
7. Sho and Daito backstory in a 2 hour movie: they are elite players who hang out at H's hide-out. They are competitors with Parzival. They are betrayed by Irok. They now have motive to join Parzival. Instead they are just random background characters that end up joining.
8. The Gundam shrank when it was fighting mechagodzilla IIRC...one of the characters said he was ""almost out of time"", then he became small as he was stabbing the neck.
9.  Infilitrating IOI could have been the entire 3rd act instead of the lame car chase and being whisked away to a Artemis's secret hideout.

You could have made the book into a movie easily without changing it a lot.
Act 1: introduce the stacks, Oasis high school, the hideout, main characters, Find and beat the 1st dungeon
Act 2. challenge 2, IOI's offer, the dance hall, Daito's murder, the stacks attack, parzival captured by IOI
Act 3; Ogden bails everyone out, Parzival hacks IOI and escapes, meet at the the last castle, final battle/challenge ensues.

The quarter, Iron Giant, and other vehicles could be prizes they win in the 1st and 2nd trials.

Things to cut: the race, the museum, some of the IOI stuff, building the Iron Giant. Instead of making the movie about knowing trivia about Halladays life (which no one can relate to), make it a movie about knowing 80's/pop culture trivia (which nearly everyone can relate to).",87yv63

It was a good movie given what it was trying to adapt (HARD), the book was so convoluted and would not translate easy to film at all with the Parzival interior monologues taking up large chunks of the book. Also a lot of the eighties references from the book were really, really outdated and obscure to the point where if I were a Hollywood executive, I might say “let’s replace this with something people will actually recognize” to keep the audience engaged and excited. I thought they chose good replacements for the parts of the book they left out and made plot alterations which created a contiguous plotline, which, like I said above, is quite impressive in its own right. So I guess what I’m trying to say is that I am a nerd and a stickler for details, but discussing this on Reddit has sort of made me come to the conclusion that these were two separate creations that shared the same name and were meant to target different audiences.

""I can’t believe I have to spell this out for you: the entire premise of Ready Player One revolves around teenagers learning about a culture THAT THEY AREN’T FAMILIAR WITH AND EMBRACE.""

I'm not talking about the kids in the book/movie, I'm talking about kids in real life, specifically the ones he has to get to come watch this movie. When you were in your late teens or early 20's did you care about the decade before you? Or the decade before that? I sure didn't! I was born in 1978(I was a '80's and '90's kid), I didn't care one bit about the '70's and really didn't care about the '60's. If you think the average teen cares about a decade two decades before they were born your delusional.

Also, the kids only embrace the stuff in the book because someone was giving away billions, not because they were somehow drawn to that culture. If Halliday was obsessed with the '00 we would have more Potter/super hero/lord of the rings reference those kids would love.

""The story became far more nonsensical (cryptic clues hidden within Haliday YouTube clips of his past?""

Not yet, that was the same in the book. Wade complete gate 1 IOI just followed, Arty did second gate IOI followed, and IOI put a force field around the third and couldn't get in the gate. Not sure how that's better then how the movie did it.

What the movie did better, gave Arty a better backstory. I didn't like her leading a giant team but revenge for her father and getting ride of the IOI 'slaves' was far better then just wanting to feed people for......reasons.

How can you literally say ""just because life is better"" and not get we are living in the best time ever. I never said it didn't ""suck ass for a vast majority of people"", but is sucks ass a little less then it use to. What metric can you use the said another time was better? Name a better time it was great to be alive?

""how are people playing their game for free?""

It's like Facebook. You don't have to pay for Facebook but it's worth billions.

""I don't see why it matters if the real world sucks if people can spend all their time living out their dreams""

What your missing is people aren't choosing the Oasis to ""living out their dreams"", they go there to escape the world. The is a fundamental difference in doing something for fun and entertainment(what your suggesting) and doing it to escape or run from your problems(what I'm suggesting). IF they were going just for fun and to live out their dreams that OK. But the movie straight said people go to escape and hid from the shitty real world, that very different then doing it because you want to be there. Here's an hypothetical for you, your walking in the wood you see a bear and quickly climb a tree. Now the question is are you in the tree because you want to be there or to escape a shit thing? There is a difference between doing something for fun and hiding from your problems.

""You're missing me on the 7 deadly sins analogy"", its a religious idea but far more traits that are bad for people. ""I see no problem with gluttonous consumption if said person isn't harming others in the process""......but it harms the person doing it. Drink 50 soda's in a day for a week straight and see if gluttony is OK. Nothing is good if you overindulgence in it. ""Being lazy isn't a moral concern"", yes it is. What if ever one get sat around and did nothing the world would go to shit fast. Try quitting your job and just sit around and do nothing for 6 months, then see how much 'better' your life is. Just a hint, it wouldn't be good.",87yv63
dwlk7ou,"> 1. Nope, your middle class is going the way of the dodo

It really isn't.

""if only rich people can get to a good hospital, what´s the point?""

Why can only rich people get good hospitals? I'm very middle class and I can go to good hospitals.

""Disagree, equality of being poor""

It's better now then it use to be. What minority or women are worse off today then they use to be?

""so you don´t know that a couple of centuries ago you could drink water from a river""

If you lived close to a river. So you didn't know the Black Plague was spread by contaminated water, killing millions.

""Heck, thirty years ago I could drink water from a 70 meter well near a 15 million people metropolis""

Not sure your 1 single example 'proves' anything. Were you sharing that well with those 15 million people? Why can't you still use the well now?

""Medicine: social allocation of existing medical resources is more important than expensive advances of very specific niches""

Not sure what the point is? We have more life saving medicine today then ever before.

""a stable economy: hahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.""

And why's that funny? It's true.

Name a better time to be alive. I'm not saying this time is perfect but it's better then it was. And in 50 year(without some unforeseen super disaster) that will be the best time.",87yv63

dwt59qv,"Then you don't really know the depth of games (and movies). All I've stated is actuality. The first puzzle is driving rather easily on a deeper level that avoids all the nostalgia.

Each puzzle restates this figurative solution into other scenes from the past and then forces the player to choose a final solution based not on the nostalgia's rules but a creative one that doesn't listen to them.",87yv63

dwmx8jy,"The only part of the book I really missed was Aech being a white male in the Oasis, and I think it lost its social commentary by making him an Orc. Besides that, I think the challenges were way more interesting to watch, because although Joust is intense in the book, it wouldn't have been as interesting to watch.",87yv63
