hl8t4v8,Damn second Ghostbusters movie in a row where Academy Award nominee Sigourney Weaver role is limited to under 2 minutes after the credits start rolling,qx6sxk
hlg2xat,I found the most unrealistic part of this movie is that a marshmallow company would be using the same mascot 30+ years after it was the symbol of destroying NYC.,qx6sxk
hl7jl8g,It was a lot of fun.  Plenty of call backs to the OG film.  Soundtrack was on point and gave me the nostalgia of the original movies.  It probably the most fun I‚Äôve had watching a movie in a while.,qx6sxk
hlaqeeq,"I throughly enjoyed the movie. This is more than likely unpopular but I‚Äôve never really minded fan service. It‚Äôs fun going through a movie like Afterlife and looking out for various Easter eggs and references to the previous entries. 

Gozer has always been my favorite villain of the GB franchise so it was cool to see her again, portrayed by Olivia Wilde no less. When Zuul and Vince Clortho possess the mom and Gruberson, it‚Äôs interesting that they decided to give them red eyes and deep voices, something that wasn‚Äôt done in the first film. It‚Äôs like they expected the audience to not know that the mom and Gruberson were possessed so they had to throw in some very obvious hints. 

Seeing the Ghostbusters stand side by side was a pretty awesome sequence, and while the inclusion of Egon‚Äôs ghost was insanely cool, it‚Äôs a harsh reminder that we will never ever get a scene like that with all four of them because of Ramis‚Äô passing in 2014. I really enjoyed the tribute to him at the end. 

I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm an easily entertained person but I had a great time watching the movie. McKenna Grace did a spectacular job. The hair and glasses they gave her did a very convincing job that she was, indeed, playing the granddaughter of Egon. I‚Äôd even argue she could be passed off as Harold Ramis‚Äô granddaughter too.",qx6sxk

hl80v1u,"You know I'm shocked Summerville didn't end up being a Sumerian death cult. With how they were building up Shandor's influence, and how they brought attention to the residents being decendents of the miners Shandor brought in, I thought for sure there was going to be a big twist where the town actively tries to keep the equipment away from the protagonists. They even had a solid angle with the sheriff, who presumably wouldve been the one in charge of keeping the proton packs and traps locked up, being the dad of one of the kid Ghostbusters. 

For what it was though, I quite liked it. Felt like a fitting send off for the original crew.",qx6sxk

I get the film was Gozer-focused so everything was pretty much tethered to the first film, but I‚Äôm one of those weirdos who loves the second one, so I would‚Äôve loved some acknowledgment to its events (even if it was just Gary geeking out about how they made the Statue walk and the kids think that sounds ridiculous).",qx6sxk

hl7qol1,[deleted],qx6sxk
hl7li14,"They really did a great job replicating the OG Ghostbusters in the new cast without it being too obvious.

Phoebe is clearly the Egon (beyond just the parental relations) with his dry humor, social awkwardness that more than likely places her on the spectrum, and a grand enthusiasm for science and finding ways to apply it.

Podcast's the Ray, the super sociable nerd whose super interested in the occult and super interested in sharing it, with a bunch of his own social quirks, but ultimately has a good heart.

Trevor, while being more in the back of the plot, is clearly the Venkman as the straight guy, the relatively normal one whose trying to survive but cares for everyone and is not as useless as they may appear when thrown into this supernatural situation.

And Lucky's the Black one!",qx6sxk

hlcq46l,"A whole bunch of disjointed throughts.  


I enjoyed the hell out of it, albeit with some squalms. It did a great job in balancing nostalgia with it's own story. Shifting the story to more Amblin-esque was a great choice.

I grew up on Ghostbusters, born in 1982. It was my first fandom. Devoured the show, wore out VHS tapes, so many toys and other merch. But don't let that think my nostalia and want for something good to blind me. Just last month No Time to Die and Halloween Kills let me down hard. 

Reusing the previous to build this ‚Äì not quite the new clothes on an old hanger like Creed or The Force Awakens is a common trend but if it works, it works. It's GhostBusters soaked in a goonies bleach too. Builds on the lore in nice ways; I love lore. Lore is my favorite part in games and world-building. 

  
The cast is phenomenal; such as energy, charisma, and character. Yes, they can be seen as analogs to the 1984 versions (compared to the mix/match well done in the 2016 take or force awakens) but it's all part of the familiar notes in a new book. McKenna Grace, who has been letting out amazing performances for years now rightly gets front and center. This is her movie. Podcast could be an annoyance but delivered so well with a great connection to Phoebe. Paul Rudd feels born for GB.

  
The first was lightning a bottle; a script built on impeccable wit and timing from the cast; so every GB film after is going to trip when trying to get the gait of dialogue; GB2016 comes close, but too many throwaway lien/jokes can distract. 

  
  
There is love and care to create something both for the lifelong fans and new. The kid sitting next to me was going nuts, fully invested, and having a ball. He was me in 1989 for GBII. I remind myself: He‚Äôs the audience. He‚Äôs who ultimately it's made for. Old fans arent‚Äô disregarded, not at all, but so much is for the young kids who will now take this franchise to their growth as we did.   
  


On the downside, I had some plot/pacing issues.

&#x200B;

It assumes we know 1984, although many of the characters don‚Äôt. So it‚Äôs kinda maddening to wait as they catch up; although it is also joy seeing their discovery so make of that as you will. Especially maddening in they stretch it; conversations are started and plot points found but scenes just end without a resolution and the expectation of things to continue. You‚Äôre uncovering something cool with your friend and then‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs later.  Wait what? Like Annie Potts pops in, you think she'd fill in details. This leads to a stretched first act and a quick end. A ghostbusters movie needs more ghosts and busting. Only a few when the mine opens. Is it strange to see if it fits for GB? They all have been slight messes with the overall plotting. Watch any of the three and tell me the exact timeline. You can‚Äôt. They are very loose there. IN GB1, Winston joins the team just as Gozer erupts but also has talked like he‚Äôs been doing it a long time; GB2 starts just before the December holidays but also gives time to completely rebuild the business and get on magazine covers, to end on NYE? They simultaneously take place over months and a few days. This one is clearly just like 3 days but close enough.   
  
It also seemed like it missed some pretty big obvious notes - or were cut. Shandor is cut down quickly and it seemed like they were going to go for the whole town is in on it - generations of cultists. Heavily implied with the sheriff. Maybe it was there at some point, but cut out. I can't help but think it would be stronger if there were more weird events occuring if Egons protections were breaking down (whether the town was in on it or not).

I loved seeing the guys back in action, but it felt really forced. But I do admit tearing up at the crew back together; Ghost Ramis/Egon was handled well. (though I do think it does Egon a little dirty... and why wouldn't Ray believe him?) 

  
But no matter how much grousing I do over details, I spent so much of the movie with a giant grin on my face and ended it covered in tears. In the end, Afterlife gave me what I wanted; a loving funny return to a beloved franchise. If we can all be the excited kid next to me, or my own self in 1989; we can enjoy and love afterlife.",qx6sxk
hld0on6,"Is no one going to mention the stack of books in the living room when they family walks into the house the first time??

‚ÄúNo human being would stack books like this!‚Äù",qx6sxk
hl7t8hx,"Can I just say how nice it is to have practical effects in a film like this? Those terror dogs looked great.

8/10 overall for me, really enjoyed this one. Could have used a little bit less of the references and retreads to the first film, but I'd say 75% of those were in service of the plot and didn't bother me.",qx6sxk

hldilgq,"Fun film. didn't expect a ghost Egon to actually appear...but I had a goofy smile when he did, especially if you see Winston's face during the climax since he's standing next to ghost egon..he has that face of ""is this really happening?"" Despite seeing crazy paranormal things as a ghostbuster.

I was curious on how we ended in nowheresville, OK (with all the equipment)...and it was interesting to hear when Stanz explained why Egon left. It was cute to find out Stanz is the sole podcast listener too.",qx6sxk
hle0m7i,"Can someone help me out? So Egon just up and takes all the equipment one day and moves to Oklahoma. How do the OG's show up with their own equipment?  Also Egon is able to prove a gate to hell exists and still can't convince Ray, Peter or Winston that this is real? 

Also why did he abandon his family? It was never explained. 

Just a few plot holes I thought about.",qx6sxk
hl8nfa7,Tell me that was Olivia Wilde as the villain at the end right?,qx6sxk
hl7quvk,"So... I saw an early showing. This was weird, because it seemed like the 7pm was the 'official'?

My theater: almost empty.

But when I came out? Lines down the block for BOTH theaters (saw it at Times Square). So it seems like there was a great deal of enthusiasm. Or maybe none and those lines were somehow for something else? Weird.

Otherwise: I really liked it. I get that there will be a great nostalgia debate, and a rehash of 2016 culture wars, etc. But I thought the young actors did well, there was a clear story, good action and effects (including the surprising practical close-up on the dog), and obviously the fact that the whole thing is basically constructed as a tribute to Harold Ramis doesn't hurt when it comes to pulling the heart strings. Actually made it feel a bit Spielbergian (you can say if that's good or bad in the 'knows how to manipulate emotional responses' sense).

Overall though, I tremendously enjoyed it.",qx6sxk
hl7shd0,"I expected it to be a huge love letter to the original films. I got that.

I hoped it would be enjoyable in its own right. I got that. 

I didn't expect to make me cry.",qx6sxk
hlc1tsv,"I liked that the movie paid proper respects to the original, but there was an odd feeling to the third act.  It felt pieced together and that there were several important scenes that ended up cut out.  For instance Ivo Shandor's brief declaration to Gozor where he was promptly ripped apart.   


I do have to give it credit for a great extra credit cameo from Sigourney Weaver.  Everyone watching the movie got to ""And Sigourney Weaver""  And someone said aloud - 'wait sigourney weaver was in it?'  Cut to mid credit scene.  Perfect timing!",qx6sxk
hl7nhj3,"Am I the only one bothered by the Idea that the rest of the the original ghostbusters flat-out didn‚Äôt believe Egon? and/or thought he was crazy? I mean they saved the world from the apocalypse on two different occasions (three if you count the game). They all knew the stakes and what was possible, and they‚Äôre going to ignore the smartest member in the group?

The biggest logic gap in the entire film for me.",qx6sxk
hlcllct,"So, did they start this whole mess by opening the trap?  If they never opened it, would this prophecy in 2021 have come to be?",qx6sxk
hlk4unr,"This was a lot of fun! Not a perfect movie by any means, but the production had a million directions they could have taken a sequel. It had to ride a fine line of nostalgia, the enthusiast communities that have come up around the originals (cosplay, prop replicas, fan fiction, comics/games, etc) and straight up new comers. 

The movie looked amazing! The sets, props, and CGI were perfect. Loved the subtle upgrades and detail shown on all the hero props. I appreciated the callbacks and cameos and loved the dedication at the end. The young actors all did a fine job. I thought the mini marshmallow men were a welcome gag. 

I liked the story ok, but even at 2hrs long, I felt like there was some room to do a little more world building. Was Callie supposed to be an out of work hair dresser? Not integral to the ghost busting side of things but I wish she had a bit more development. 

Why was the town not inhabited by Gozer/Shandor cultists? I had the initial feeling that was where they were going with it. Wouldn't they all be the grandchildren and great grandchildren of the people who mined and built the temple?  Even Lucky said she was 4th gen in that town. Nope, just a bunch of dim witted people and cops who apparently didn't see Muncher tearing up the town. 

I wish there were a few more ghosts on the loose terrorizing the town before the big finale. Other than the terror dogs, we got Muncher annnnnnd zombie ordering coffee? I wish the final battle was a little more dynamic. It was a lot of zapping. 

But you know what really took me out of the whole film?! The damn RC car trap that seemed to move and react like a sentient robot side kick. Why was it driving miles at highway speeds and drifting around corners? Come on, haha. 

A worthy sequel in my opinion. Hopefully it reinvigorates the franchise. 

Edit: The production really doesn‚Äôt seem to care that GB2 or GBTVG exist. All of the behind the scenes stuff and tweaks to equipment seem to be based directly on ‚Äò84. It‚Äôs really too bad.",qx6sxk
hlm1sd9,I love the ‚Äúrich person who is extremely devoted to supernatural/fantasy entity and then gets slaughtered upon actually meeting them‚Äù trope.,qx6sxk
hlcl1v4,"So full disclosure. Ghostbusters was the first nerdy thing I got into. It‚Äôs the first movie I remember seeing and being taken in. It‚Äôs the first thing I remember pretending to be. I had 3 friends growing up who also loved GB. We had all toys. We watched the cartoon together. Before the Turtles, before Comics, before video games. For me there was Ghostbusters. So I can‚Äôt truly give you an unbiased opinion.

Having said that. This movie was literally written for me. It was the adventures I pretended to have. Can a movie that relies on nostalgia be a good movie? I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is that I was happy the whole time I watched it. Like a pure childish happy. Maybe nostalgia is a cheap way to get a reaction from the audience but I don‚Äôt think it was done for the sake of manipulating the audience emotion. There was no way Jason Reitman didn‚Äôt love his dad‚Äôs work as much as i did back then. So yeah I thought it was great. If everyone else in the world hated it I wouldn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs going into my rotation of feel good movies.",qx6sxk
hlbagsg,I‚Äôm very happy that the tradition of Ghostbusting costing millions of dollars in property damage continued,qx6sxk

hlbxdg1,"Just saw it tonight, and I have been so rarely giddy after watching a movie. Honestly, they did everything right. I never lost interest at any point, and it was obvious this movie was made with love for the franchise.

Part of it may have been this was the first movie I've seen in the theater in over two years, but my feelings still stand.",qx6sxk

hl7uzyi,I left this movie with a happy heart,qx6sxk
hl90z9q,"I was so scared going into this movie. Egon was always my favorite character so I was curious to see what they would do. The way they handled his legacy was great. I loved the story even if it did take a bit to get started for me. The humor was there and McKenna is a damn star. 

The ending had me bawling. I thought the OG boys showing up was amazing but when ghost Egon shows up I lost it. Beautiful tribute to a great man",qx6sxk
hlfn4he,"Moving forward, I'm glad we got Murray one last time, but I hope we get more Hudson and Aykroyd in any future installments. I love what they did with Winston and Ray.

hmcu0lw,"I guess Im in the minority here cuz I didn't like it.

The entire time I felt like things were happening and not happening at the same time. The dialogue was cringe and character interactions ridiculously cliche. 

Everyone seemed relatively unbothered by the supernatural. We got barely any ghosts besides the blue guy and main ones. Idk, the film felt empty to me. Immean, we have this massive supernatural event happening in the town and barely ever get  any reaction shots from the towns people? Where was everyone? Did the studio not wanna dish out the money for extras? Whats up with the empty Walmart (walmart is never empty lol).  And the nostalgia thrills just didnt hit, felt too forced.",qx6sxk

hlc54nk,Honestly one of my favorite movies of the year. Just a fun movie in general.,qx6sxk
hlci6hf,"I won't lie, it actually felt pretty nice seeing a new Ghostbusters film that actually featured real direction after so long. This was lovely. The Midwestern setting and the Amblin-esque tone do a great job to help make it stand out from the other films, the effects are fantastic, Rob Simonsen's score is outstanding, it's very funny, and Mckenna Grace is absolutely terrific. Make no mistake; this film belongs to her. In regards to the fan service, I thought most of it was done fairly well. Admittedly, it does start to become overwhelming during the third act, but for the most part, it's handled nicely. I'm willing to forgive even the lesser moments of fan service because this film was made with such a striking deal of sincerity and heart, and the new things it does do are done really well. Obviously, this doesn't hold a candle to the original (and if I'm being honest, I even prefer Ghostbusters II), but as far as the future of this franchise is concerned, it's looking pretty bright. Whatever they have to offer next, I'm down.",qx6sxk
hlclm6c,"I‚Äôm not some huge nostalgia nut for the originals, so I don‚Äôt feel like I have nostalgia glasses on or nostalgia hate boner either.

This was charming, wholesome, and, most importantly, earnest. Unlike the 2016 film ‚Ä¶ and many films between 2000 and 2016, this movie didn‚Äôt want to shit on the source and make fun of it.

hm7fsza,"Here's the thing about Ghostbusters: yes it was ultimately a comedy, but people tend to forget that the stakes were still REAL. Even among the jokes, there was still a clear and present danger and tension that took itself seriously, and that's what I wanted from this. 

The plot still matters, relationships still matter, the CALLBACKS matter, which is why it all works as a sincere tribute to what came before. Calling up Ray actually *meant* something, and not just for the cameos at the end; it was all in service of building up Igon's presence throughout the whole film so that the ending with him standing side by side with Phoebe and having a reunion with Callie pays off in gangbusters. This was a complete and total Harold Ramis tribute film, holy shit how awesome is that? And it still managed to have awesome moments of its own, like that very first opening scene, and the Blue Slimmer chase being a SERIES highlight as far as I'm concerned. For all this talk about ""oh, this doesn't do anything new"", we've never seen an action sequence like that in a GB film üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Anyone that tried to convince me that Jason freakin Reitman of all people was gonna phone it in, I'm sorry but I really can't take you seriously anymore, because this was such a heartfelt love letter to his father's work that even with some of its underwritten side characters, the utter LACK of irony and cynicism on display here makes up for it.

There were a row of kids behind me at my screening, and I have no doubt that this is going to be one cherished movie memory for them. I would've gone gaga for this too. This is the Ghostbusters movie I've been waiting for.",qx6sxk

Not counting the big ones there were what? Three Ghosts?

Muncher

The old miner

and The Eye Ball Ghost.  (I do have to admit I really enjoyed that one.  A real Easter egg.)

When the ghosts were released from the mountain I was expecting a montage of them causing havoc in town.  

What about Slimer? They could have shown it somewhere.

I have to admit when I heard the main title theme I felt a chill go down my spine, but beyond that and a generic pop song tacked on the end there was nothing there music wise.",qx6sxk

However, one part I didn't understand was why Egon directed Phoebe to the trapped ""dog"" ghost, especially after it was successfully kept hidden for so long. Keeping it trapped (or destroying it somehow?) seemed to be the ideal way of preventing Gozer's return forever. 

Another question, why was Egon's ghost seemingly spared by the ghost traps?

I felt sad for the metal-eating ghost, since it didn't seem evil, only addicted to metal. It never attacked anyone, it only defended itself after getting shot at. I guess all these ghosts were released when the gates of hell opened, though. We saw one at the caf√©, one that we knew from the original movie; there should enough ghosts to return for there to be a sequel. But busting ghosts does not seem a viable business unless there are extraordinary events like a Sumerian god returning from hell.",qx6sxk
hl7iqqc,"This movie was definitely a crowd pleaser. 

You have the cute factor with the suicidal/homicidal mini-Stay Puffs. You have the suspense scenes where the music cuts out then‚Ä¶BLARGH! and you have the heavy nostalgia factor with the old cast returning*. All on top of introducing new cast members and a new setting.

It also seems to keep in line with the original movie not changing too much for ‚Äúmodern times‚Äù. Overall i‚Äôd say this was a worthy sequel to the original",qx6sxk
hl8h2an,"So in the intro, Egon has captured one of two terror dogs and the other one comes after him and kills him. It seems to me like the terror dog in the trap would have been Vinz Clortho (the Keymaster), obstinately because he's the ""slow"" one of the two, and Zuul came to claim Egon since he hid the trap in the floor. This would be a nice callback to Janine Melnitz's dialog to Egon about her awful feeling about Louis Tully (indirectly referring to Vinz the Keymaster) and that Egon would die. Symbolizing that Egon's capture of Vinz Clortho in the intro sealed his fate.",qx6sxk

There's having slight little nods to the original, and then there's fucking this.  Just tossing everything at you in hopes that nostalgia will make you look over the awful story and dumb characters....

Like seriously.... Chess starts playing itself? "" well, this is happening""..  Lamp starts guiding you through some creepy lab? ""ok no biggie""..... Earth shoes and a firery demon fly's out of a mine shaft whole like 8 teens watch it?   ""ahahahha whoa..."".   Everyone's reaction to fucking ghosts is 'lol, ok....""

And  the end..... It would have worked with ghoat egon holding the proton beam with the kid... And then that's it.   But no, they dragged it on for 5 minutes and everyone talked to him while his ghost just kinda smiled and shrugged like a mime.

This movie showed how to properly do a Ghostbusters movie with a female lead and boy did she rock it.

hl7i1go,"Honestly had a lot of fun with this one. I thought the comedy was solid and casting on point, and even though Ghostbusters has never been a particularly emotional series I thought the emotional beats in this were well handled and all the better knowing the context behind the director. 

It definitely was trying to keep true to the 80s style practical effects and look that is of the time for the original. From the opening where we see Egon race to the farm town I could tell a lot of attention was paid to make sure the cars moved with heft and realism. It still felt very modern, a bit Abramsy, but the feel was very 80s nostalgia which I thought, even if hokey, was the right direction. 

I thought the cast was pretty great. Phoebe was a really cool lead and the moments where she got to fire the proton packs felt really satisfying for some reason. Didn't care a ton for Finn's character but I love Carrie Coon and thought she was a great choice for the emotional core and you can't go wrong with Paul Rudd being charming and confused and giving him room to play. And I really enjoyed Podcast's Goonies feel.

If you're looking for something that is just like Ghostbusters 1984 then you might be disappointed, I mean the landscape is just different now. This is definitely an easier sell to families and made for the current market of family blockbusters. But if you're down with that, I think there's a fair bit of fun to be had and even some nostalgia along the way. I felt like such an idiot but I damn near almost cried when Phoebe said ""I'm a scientist"" to her mom in the car after firing from the gunner seat. It really felt like Jason Reitman really cared about this and was able to make me feel the same. 

One thing that kept distracting me was I honestly felt like no one was respecting the seriousness of the plot? Like, the kids find a ghost trap and a grown ass adult who is aware of what happened in the 80s is just like, let's open this. And then they do and an evil spirit comes out, and despite there not being a ghost sighting in 30 years but it being proven that ghosts exist, they basically don't tell anyone and keep going about their day? Also when the kids get arrested I guess zero people reported the literal ghost sighting they just experienced to the cops because the movie was playing the ""nobody believes us"" angle. Idk, I just thought all that was a bit weird. 

But in the end, I had a really good time watching this. It feels like a movie where flaws may become more apparent upon rewatches, but for what I wanted when I walked into the theater today I felt like the mission was accomplished. I had some laughs, got some nostalgia pings, and honestly am very impressed by McKenna Grace. I would give this a solid 7/10.

/r/reviewsbyboner",qx6sxk
hl7vph9,"I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. Not a perfect 10, but a good bit better than the 2016 remake.

They pulled off a very difficult task of hologramming in a deceased actor while remaining respectful and not just feeling like they were selling tickets to his grave. The last ten minutes had it very dusty in the theater and i was very glad Winston also got a proper epilogue/setup.

Im pretty certain Akroyd was being serious about being the only subscriber to super niche paranormal podcasts. 

The Stay Puft Marshmellow scene in Walmart is one of my favorite things ive seen this year. Absolute masterpiece of hedonism.

Carrie Coon was a bad mom and more should have been made of that instead of Paul Rudd just hand waving it away with ‚Äúyou showed up, that makes you a badass‚Äù. She starts out apparently not having a job, living in an expensive city with 2 teenagers (and no real word on what happened to the father other than ‚Äúhe didnt get along with my nerd of a daughter, he loved the boy though, couldnt stand the little dweeb‚Äù), not paying their rent for god knows how long (and giving doe eyes to the landlord to the point i half thought she was going to try to gatekeeper her way out of the back rent), has no idea that her daughter is rewiring her bedroom, doesnt attempt to find a job or really learn how to turn the farm into valuable real estate (other than buying one can of paint, hint you should probably try to get a tractor running), hell she puts more effort into finding a date with her daughters summer school teacher than finding a way to feed her kids, doesnt even give them a heart to heart about being arrested. 

Rudd being a seismologist felt like it was trying to make a bigger point that got cut (maybe it was just that fracking was in the news a lot more when this was being written than nowadays)

Onto Gozer

- i didnt see a Rick Moranis cameo (understandable but i remember there being chatter of him coming out of retirement for this), would have loved to have seen him somewhere in Gozers scenes or even just a shot of old man Tully walking through town when the ghost flies by.

- my understanding is Ivo Shandor built the skyscraper and his tomb as redundancies for the same goal - eternal life and unlimited power. Feels like a bit of story was cut, particularly with the other dates being referenced as Krakatoa, Tagunska, Hiroshima, and beyond. Also of note, his death year was 1945 (iirc) same year cited on the carvings (probably Hiroshima or Nagasaki). My thought is hes possibly been around for a lot longer, similar to Apocolypse he just pops up at different points and causes his havoc. There almost seemed to be a pattern to the years, but i couldnt make it out.

- absolutely loved the ‚ÄúRay?‚Äù Callback

I get what the criticisms will be, but i for one thought they did a good job of respecting the new generation of Ghostbusters while having some heart for the originals, they paid respect to Ramis and didnt make it too cheesy, and as much as i absolutely knew Akroyd was going to be holding the blaster at the end, it was a payoff that felt very special and the last 10 minutes brought a tear to my eye.",qx6sxk

Other than that, loved every moment. Heard someone call it McKenna's movie and they're right... she ran the movie IMHO (the dry humour she had worked perfectly). Paul Rudd was Paul Rudd and that's a good thing. Did not expect JK Simmons at all.... and i've been trying to work out who played Gozer, but they're not listed...

Clever framing for the opening scene, shows it was Egon without showing him.... and the end... Knew it was going to happen but it hit the same. Same as seeing the other three return.

I'm still not sure how I feel about CGI Ramis. On one hand it was a very sweet tribute, on the other it's kinda weird.

To me, McKenna Grace and Rudd carried most of this movie and did a really good job doing so. The rest of the cast were decent. I thought they were going to make Trevor the Venkman type which I'm glad they didn't.

One thing that really bothered me was saving the scene with Winston until after the credits where not one person remained in the cinema expect myself and my wife.

hliutey,"I‚Äôve waited decades for this movie. 

Ghostbusters was always my thing. After my Dad fell out of the airplane in ‚Äò87, I was stuck in Florida for months while he recuperated and my Mom rented Ghostbusters to keep me entertained. Three year old me must have watched it a hundred times that winter. Then Real Ghostbusters came along followed by GB2. My childhood was all Ghostbusters. 

Fast forward to my early teenage years when the internet was in its infancy. I rediscovered my love for the movies and Extreme Ghostbusters came out. I found Ghostbusters fan sites and made my own. Imagine my surprise when I read that Aykroyd was trying to make a third movie. 

I was there when the latest hot rumor was Danny wanted Chris Farley as one of the new recruits. That‚Äôs how long this has been going on. All those years of rumors and false starts. I gave up hope and the video game helped fill the void. 

I still can‚Äôt believe that last night I was sitting in a theater watching Ghostbusters 3.

hl7u1ep,"The most apt thematic comparison for Ghostbusters: Afterlife is The Force Awakens. This movie perfectly nailed the balance between moving into the future, while honoring what came before.

The casting/writing for the kiddos was fantastic. Not only did they avoid the tropes of either being outright annoying or acting/speaking like adults, but they were positively endearing - especially Phoebe and Podcast. Paul Rudd was his usual hilarious, slightly oblivious self, which is always welcome.

The opening scene was one of the best, and really helped to set the tone. There were a lot of great callbacks that didn't feel too heavy handed, and the Mini Marshmallow Men are definitely going to be a favorite.

So much has already been said here about the return of the Original Ghostbusters, and all of it is true. From their entrance, to a certain exit, it was handled spectacularly. Even from my standpoint as a very casual fan of the franchise, all of the chills and emotions were there.

This was a very solid 8/10 for me, and seemed to be a huge winner with the crowd at my theater. There was laughter all throughout and plenty of reactions to the nostalgic inclusions.

I loved it.  Obviously it's not the first movie, it would be a near impossible task to top that.  However with what they had it was amazing.

One thing I did notice is that there seems to be a lot that was cut out.  Just watching the movie it seemed like there were some scenes missing. 

 In fact the Sentinal Terror Dog, which was a terror dog that stood upright like a person and had really long horns was completely cut.  They even released a toy of this character.

I think when we get to home release there is 100% going to be an extended cut.

The tone and pacing of the film is definitely slower and less slapstick than the previous 2. But it‚Äôs work for the setting and story, for the most part. 

My biggest complaint would have to be the major plot convenience with certain characters and cameos. 

The original cast just kind of pops in with no real reason to being there; aside from Ray. Odd that the original crew just ‚Äúta-da‚Äôs‚Äù in at the absolute peak of the climax. It would have been nice seeing Ray try to round them up to head Summerville or have them more involved in the plan, but the cameos seemed just too forced for the sake of having them. 

Also felt convenient that the giant wall of pictures of the mom growing up was never seen by anyone else but her in the lab. I‚Äôm just being nit-picky but it stood out to me.

And in the end when the original ghostbusters appears I felt nothing because their participation was absolutely anti-climatic. And the scene with Egon and the girl... jesus...

Wasn‚Äôt amazing, very Force Awakens-y and the tonal switch to more Spielbergian might be alienating to fans of the OG (but I think is probably the only way to do a legacy sequel with the intent on franchising: you need dramatic heft to have hooks for sequels otherwise you‚Äôre going to run out of track real quick). 

Some of the callbacks were absolutely painful and unnecessary, specifically the back-to-back Twinkie and Who Ya Gonna Call. 

The old cast was nice to see in their actual roles. But, simultaneously awkward and stiff. I can‚Äôt ever imagine Venkman excited about a proton pack except in the context of being written as a legacy celebration film. The film probably would‚Äôve been stronger if they didn‚Äôt show up in the finale. 

I also think that 2016 unfortunately did suck the air out of the novelty of rediscovering the proton packs/car/etc. Had it been the first time seeing that imagery again it would‚Äôve hit harder, despite being in the proper canon this time. 

The kids were fun but Podcast was kind of annoying and the girl was I think a few too many IQ points over believable (similarly essentially turning Egon into a Jedi with a secret lair). It was pretty on the nose how much of an analogue they were to the originals, which becomes weirder when it‚Äôs a sequel instead of reboot (even down to the underwritten black Ghostbuster!) 

Ghost Egon was simultaneously sweet and awkward. But Ghostbusters was as much his baby as Aykroyds so I don‚Äôt feel too ethically weird about it. It is funny how he got the role that Murray always wanted when talking about a Ghostbusters 3 over the years (dead in the opening and appearing as a ghost at the end). 

I like that for the most part the ghosts were played straight (excepting the Slimer and Stay Puft analogues/copies), unlike 2016. 

Also, goddamn Hudson has aged well.",qx6sxk
hrghztb,I found the movie to be pretty boring and didn't expect it to borrow so much from the first movie. It was cool seeing the original cast in it. I just wish the story was more interesting,qx6sxk
hrj7ela,"Am I the only one who thought the effects overall looked quite spectacular and very reminiscent of 80s movie optical effects at their best? I am pretty unimpressed by most modern CG effects in movies, even when done well; I find CGI heavy action sequences boring in a lot of superhero movies for example. It is also because I find CGI even when great has a look that pulls me out of the movie. Afterlife never did that, and the finale was absolutely gorgeous to look at. Obviously the movie was homaging 80s family sci-fi hard, but I felt the effects were really doing the same. The proton beams alone looked gorgeously vibrant in a way I find a lot of modern CG doesn't but old school rotoscoping used to.",qx6sxk

hlevkxs,"It felt off to me. It relies far too much on nostalgia (90 percent of all scenes relied on callbacks) and the tone is not what I want from ghostbusters. It was fine I guess as a movie, but it just felt like a nostalgia humping of the original, without any of the charm.",qx6sxk
hlmznth,"The movie was just okay for me. I felt it was too much of a childrens movie and made certain creative choices to ensure it was seen as so that I really disliked like the mini Stay Puff's which originally only happened as a manifestation of what Ray was thinking. The original movie might have been watched by us all as children but it was far from a childrens movie. This was a lame decision made just to sell toys.The main storyline with Gozer felt all too similar for me, like a copy paste of the first film. Gozer had about as much screen time as she did in the first film and we didn't get to see her true power. She just walked down the stairs, then walked down the dirt towards the house and that was it for her. Also the lines ""Gozer is neither a man nor a woman"" were super cringey when the first words out of JK Simmons mouth when he came back to life were something like ""Princess of darkness, we've created this alter to worship you""

The main character wasn't terrible. Kinda flat and emotionless but it didn't ruin the film for me. There was one scene where she complained about having to go to public school which was dumb to me. They went above and beyond to show how poor they were yet I was supposed to believe that this family who has no money and was getting evicted had the main character in private school? lol...okay.

I disliked how little the original cast was in the film. I wish they were embedded into the storyline more and showed the kids how to ghostbust instead of the kid being a Mary Sue who just knew how to do everything because she had an inclination for science. This would've made a more satisfying final confrontation with Gozer when they fought her together. Weirdly enough, this movie somehow made me less excited for Spiderman cause I know they're going to use the same trope at the end where the original characters everyone is most excited to see will show up when our protagonist doesnt look like he stands a chance.

hl7nqba,"Kinda weird that this reminded me more of Goonies or ET than a Ghostbusters movie but it mostly worked.  The brother character was kind of worthless but the little girl was fantastic.  I was just glad they made a Ghostbusters movie that wasn‚Äôt a retread of the first one like part 2 and 2016 were.  There was a fun mystery at the center of the movie and I genuinely enjoyed as it became uncovered.  Overall, it was a fun and cute, a bit more kids movie than I would have liked but it‚Äôs a pretty good kids movie at least.

I feel like the movie was written backwards from the guys blasting their proton packs alongside ghost Harold Ramis.  It‚Äôs the most shameless kind of fan service but god damn it, I‚Äôm not made of stone.  

Also, Bill Murray is aging horribly and Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver are aging beautifully.",qx6sxk
hlgj4ug,"It was heavily hinted that Phoebe was on the spectrum. She had trouble making friends. She deals with overstimulation and has issues expressing emotion and humor. Her mom and dad both had trouble connecting with her (her dad even bounced over it). She mentioned that her and Egon were ""special"".

It was always a theory that Egon was on the spectrum too and I feel like that was also confirmed without saying so. Not only is autism hereditary, but Egon prioritizing his interests over his relationships was a dead give away. Plus Egon caring a lot for his daughter from a distance was another sign too. It's what some autistic people do as an alternative to maintaining a relationship (which is hard for them to do).

This script, without a doubt, had input from a person with intimate knowledge of autism and family relationships (maybe Dan Akroyd, who has autism). And it was a very nice touch to see all of that represention on the screen and treated with care. Phoebe was a very awesome character and played expertly by McKenna. She's going to go places.",qx6sxk

Movies like this always get roasted for being a nostalgic trip, but often forget that this movie isn‚Äôt only for the die hard fans of Ghostbusters, but instead the whole family with the mother or father who is starry eyed watching their kids start to love something they did as a kid. It‚Äôs a great entry level experience for younger audiences to now appreciate the OG movie. Very well executed in my opinion.

Just awkward hold on Ecto 1, proton pack, Dan Akroyd, etc.     

 I didn't hate the movie, there are things I liked (McKenna Grace, Paul Rudd) but If the whole point of a movie is to remind you how great Ghostbusters is, why not just watch Ghostbusters? I don't get this desire for nostalgia.

Why was phoebe in summer school?

I personally had an absolute blast with the film. I also saw it in 4DX, and if you have the option, DO IT for this film. Easily the best 4D flick ive experienced. Made the experience super fun and did great use of all the senses. Especially that opening sequence and the scene where they're chasing Slimer.

Was watching it with my father too. He saw Ghostbusters as a teenager in the 80's in theaters, so seeing the OG's pop up near the end, sparingly, in theaters, all these years later was fantastic for him. Ramus ghost could of went so wrong, but was done fantastic. The overall film was a blast and I appreciate that they mentioned 2016 GB wasn't canon. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome.

I actually thought it was a sequel to the female Ghostbusters movie from 2016, which I really disliked even though it got stellar reviews.  So I was bracing for more overrated hype, and was expecting CGI and lame jokes.  But it's got real story and characters.

I didn't re-watch any of the previous Ghostbusters movies though, so I was a bit lost on the importance of Egon / Ramis in the cannon and the behind the scenes drama from the past, and thus didn't quite feel the impact of the ending that others did.  I saw people crying, and it flew over my head.

I thought the actor who played Phoebe was just phenomenal.  She had real emotional understanding at such a young age. I looked her up on IMDb afterwards because I didn't recognize her at all, and was astounded that she was the little girl in ""Gifted"".  I would have never made that connection on my own.  McKenna Grace.  Who knew.

My theater was pretty empty, which is the only reason I went on opening night.  I'm 3x vaxxed, but still avoid crowds, just out of habit I guess.  That, and to avoid loud assholes at the movies.  

But this movie deserves an audience.  If you haven't seen it yet, go ahead and re-familiarize yourself with the original films.  I was lazy, and missed out on a lot because of it.",qx6sxk

hldj381,"I liked it. I wanna say maybe even loved it. I explained it to my family as The Force Awakens done better. In that it explains the circumstances that have led to this. The current situation is explained. What happened to the original team is explained. Why the new cast has the old equipment. Learning/discovering with Egon's ghost and then training with old equipment instead of not giving us any of that so we're asking ""Ok, but how did she know how to do that?"". And most of all unlike TFA, giving us the OG 4 back together on screen, at the same time, firing their proton packs. Even if it was for just one scene and via cgi (or was that an actor?). Either way.

No bs kick the can down the road with it's explanations. No refusing to give fans what they wanted.

Did it go overboard with nostalgia? I don't think so really. The new cast, especially Phoebe really stood on their own. Stranger Things kid was probably the weakest, he's just there in the background most of the time. Their own story is just happening within this soft reboot.

Maybe the mini marshmallow men were going too far. Especially because I don't understand why they're there. I mean I *know* why they're there. For marketing and nostalgia. But in universe I don't understand why they're there. They just pop out. Because of the terror dog's presence? But then they do play a role in the story at the end when they're trying to stop everyone from fighting Gozer by screwing up the equipment. So idk.

And Shandor but that wasn't even nostalgia. That was absoulte ??? Why? How? He had 30 seconds, at best of screen time and then gets killed. So why bother? He had nothing to do with the plot beyond being the crazy that built all this. Was he dead? How was he preserved if he wasn't? Was he under a spell? Was he meant to be a sacrifice unbeknownst to him? Idk. It felt like he was a plot thread they filmed that was originally in the script but removed most of it in editing yet left those bits of him in still. Because he makes no sense being there.

I guess those are my two issues. Even the OG showing up at the end I don't have a problem with. Ray knew something was up.

It was awesome and captured what my image of Ghostbusters was as a kid. Not so much a comedy but more of an action/horror kind of movie. The humor is as subtle as the originals were and it felt like it was trying to be serious but at the same time not, again, just like I felt the originals were. 

My only real wishes were that we had more of it, and that the brother had a bit more to do; I got that he's the Winston stand in, and like him wasn't that integral as anything other than the 4th guy, but even so. 

And while the Ramis tribute was predictable from the moment I realized who we were following in the beginning, it was done really well and I'm happy they kept him silent even though I expected a line. 

And I'm honestly flabbergasted at the hate it's getting here. It feels like people didn't want to like this movie and can't let it go. This is precisely why, particularly for movies like this, I do my best to go in blind.

While yea, I can see how its flawed, and flawed it is, and maybe there's a better story to have done with regards to Ghostbusters, its one of those movies that was fun and entertaining so I can look past contrivances or faults. Like Godzilla Vs Kong - not a great movie, not deep or cerebral, but it was fun and sometimes, that's all you need from a movie. Its Ghostbusters, it was always silly and humorous and this movie felt in line with that, if anything this movie conveyed more heart than the previous ones. I felt it handles the nostalgia great - lot of ppl argue this movie does the first movies climax again - I disagree - I saw it as the second coming of Gozer - and the final moments were similar but vastly different - I didn't see them fight a giant Marshmallow man in this film - it came down to a more personal battle.

Now a movie like the Matrix Ressurections (which I hated), which is a film series that is presented as being deep, layered and cerebral does not get the same pass as this movie. The tone of the movie and what it sets out to do will always impact my enjoyment levels and how much I want to think about its plot or analyze what I was given (sometimes, movies really are just entertainment - they don't all have to be masterpieces). I was greatly content with Ghostbusters Afterlife - I loved the characters, the ghost chase scene was one of the most exciting things I've seen from this franchise.

hl7iigr,"*[red eyes and deep voice] There is no movie, there is only Easter eggs.*

This movie is boring and bad. Really it's not more complicated than that. 

I'm not saying there isn't a lot to be said about nostalgia, ways it embraces and departs from the original, fan service, reboots, distracting product placement, tv sitcom level dialogue, how much a movie like this needs to reintroduce versus assume knowledge of the lore, the post-credits phenomenon, the fact that there's now been four Ghostbuster movies and only one clearly good one, the weird Paul Rudd character whose literal job it is to teach kids but he's just ""fuck it, they're not interested"" and then he's on a date with a woman who specifically tells him she's not interested in science and he's like ""nah, shut up and listen, broad, I'mma teach you"", the particularly inexplicable amount of first act drag, the weird jail scene, and more. 

There is a lot to be said on all those topics. But it should be said in addition to, not rather than, the simple truth: this movie is boring and bad. 

2 hours of Pheobe telling terrible jokes would have been so much better than this movie. 

Also, as an aside, it's perhaps not a coincidence that some of the Podcast stuff plays beat for beat like the Eternals Kino/Karun stuff, because maybe it's something obvious in our age of everyone creating #content. If movies have to keep playing this tune, however, I hope they learn to play it better (the sparse appearance of Klev in Shang-Chi was good).

Moving from NYC to Oklahoma and having this be a generational story with kids were good ideas. The car chase through the city was fun. Every other idea and scene that went into this was the wrong one. 

Nothing offensively stupid or historically terrible, this isn't in the running with Dear Evan Hansen for worst of the year, it's still got a good cast and Ghostbusters, but it's plainly boring and bad.

hld6s3m,"Seems like I'm in the minority but this movie was just not good.  Like, at all.

As a fan of the original, I just wanted a good movie in the same world with likeable characters and a story that was new but felt connected.  What we got was probably the lowest effort movie we could have gotten.

First off, who the hell writes these movies?  Seriously!  Halloween kills had awful dialogue, Free Guy had pretty awful dialogue, and this movie had pretty trash dialogue too.  There were a few clever jokes, but a LOT of just cringy attempts at humor.  Podcast kid is not how any kid I've ever known would act and was insufferable and not funny.  Phoebe is just a smart girl who is smart.  Paul Rudd's character is a seismologist who pretty much accomplishes nothing in the movie besides getting possessed, and tells us that the earthquakes are weird.  I guess Rick Moranis doesn't really accomplish much in the original either, but Rick feels like he has a much larger presence in the movie and more well defined character traits.

There are a few implied romances in this movie, all which feel flat.  The brother and the girl at the fast food restaurant was... I mean what even was that.  She picks on him relentlessly the first few minutes, even mentions she's got a boyfriend, then just seemingly forms an attachment because movie.  The alcoholic mom and Paul Rudd's character go on a date even though they have 0 shared interest because movie.  The annoying as hell Podcast kid joins with Phoebe despite being overly intrusive and brash because movie.

I obviously wouldn't care so much if this stuff was more sidelined but LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS FOR MOST OF THIS MOVIE so we're stuck with kinda generic characters with relationships that feel surface level.  Just a lot of establishing and learning that the ghostbusters were a thing.  Lots of retreading ground and nostalgic baiting.  The kids encounter the ghostbuster's stuff and just pick it up and know how to use everything.  ""I don't believe in ghosts"" was a line said by one of the characters, despite the fact that an event of the scale of the original movie would be taught in every school ever.  So we spend most of the first half of the movie just waiting for the team to finally catch a ghost- which they eventually do.  They catch one ghost the entire movie (Ok, ignore the climax which I'll talk about soon.).  Most of the movie is just... nothing happening.

The last half of the movie is just rehashing a lot of the plot of the original but in a way that is just... very predictable.  Key master, Gate keeper, dogs, and trapping the same god from the first movie.  Nothing much changes.  The only difference is everything feels much less grand because we've done this all before, and there is no comedic payoff like the Stay Puft in the original.  The climax is literally just someone shooting a lazer at the god and the god shooting a lazer back, but our protagonist is stronger because the power of love or friends or something.

Which leads me to another huge problem with the movie:  The main character.  Whenever there is any sort of problem, the solution is just handed to her.  I know we like to complain about Rey Skywalker but how the hell does this movie get a pass?

\-In the opening hour, Egon's ghost just... guides her to everything.  The lair, the proton pack, the ghost trap, the suits.  She literally discovers none of this on her own.

\-It just so happens that she knows everything about, well, everything.  How does she know about seismology?  She's just smart duh!  How does she know how to repair a proton pack?  She's just smart duh!  How is she able to operate old equipment and catch a ghost?  She's just smart duh!

\-When they got caught by the police, the police hold them for a night then... let them go because movie.  They destroyed like half the town but no, it's ok, their alcoholic mom is here let's just entrust her to care over them.

\-When they need to break into the police headquarters, no need to worry- the police are gone.  Easy!

\-In the climax, when things look like there might be some tension, the original ghostbusters just arrive right on time.  There's no establishing scene of them getting back together, no tension that maybe some of them don't want to do it anymore, nope!  They're just back right on time and ready to just save the day.

\-The original team get bested by the god, but Phoebe is able to hold her own because she's SPECIAL.

Some other things I found really stupid:

\-Egon shows himself at the end, but never revealed himself at all earlier in the movie ever even when it would have made the plot move along much faster.  I understand it's emotional because we see him but it just doesn't make any sense, especially since he's established to be in our world throughout the movie.

\-Lots of times, ghosts are seen escaping the mine but when we go into the mine, there are plasma beams that keep them at bay which is a really cool idea but like, how did ANY of the demon dogs escape?  Or the metal eating ghost?

\-Lots of weird and kinda creepy dialogue surrounding the kids.  ""I wish my daughter would take up pole dancing.""  ""I'm an escort"" (After dropping the kids off).  The two kids talking about the mother being boned by Paul Rudd's character.  Why was any of this necessary?  None of it was funny.

\-The god after coming to life just... sat there.  Didn't even try doing anything.  Didn't start heading to town.  Just... sat there.  Honestly if they just left her alone, life would probably just continue like normal.

\-The climax was super underwhelming.  There is nothing tense about characters shooting light at a villain who shoots light back.  Also they was a moment during the climax they quirky light hearted music was playing that completely destroyed any tension and made the climax feel like a joke.

\-The only things that came to life in the Walmart were the StayPuft marshmallows.  None of the other food came to life, or any of the other inanimate objects.  Just the nostalgia bait.  Isn't that so nostalgic guys?

\-The only one curious about seismological events in a town with no fault lines or volcanic activity is some random teacher.

\-Apparently nobody else saw the metal eating ghost running around in the town because nobody says anything or tries to defend the kids.

\-Apparently the brother is just a genius at fixing cars with no access to tools or parts, as its established the family is poor.

\-The ghost buster suits just fit the kids because why not.

\-The girl who worked at the fast food place just joins the group without asking any questions.

\-A lot of weird dialogue like: ""Maybe it's the apocalypse."" Then... cut and change scene.  Like are we not going to address how she got to that conclusion so fast or even how Paul Rudd would respond to that idea?  Nope, we're just rolling with it.

I didn't think any of the new cast really stood out beside Mckenna Grace.  And did anyone just feel like the ending of the film was paced oddly?  I seemed like a ton of scenes were cut out and didn't flow at all.  Honestly, the best part of the movie is when the original Ghostbusters riff for 2 minutes because that's the only time that the film has a personality.

They really milked the nostalgia stuff as expected which really didn't work for me, I'm just pretty fed up of ""homage sequels"" that rehash both the iconography and plot of the original without bringing anything fresh and interesting as well.

Cringed when Ghost Egon happened because it's such a predictable way to try and push people's emotional buttons but it could've been a lot worse.

I'm not sure this is a franchise that really needed the torch passed to some young ghostbusters, I'm just not feeling that at all. If this had been a one-off farewell to the original gang I might've gone easier on it, but I'm really not interested in two more of these movies focused on the younger heroes.

McKenna Grace and Carrie Coon were really good. The appearances of the legacy characters were pretty underwhelming overall, they looked like they were shot in like a day. I was hoping they were gonna be a bigger part of the 3rd act.

I can see this doing really well with general audiences regardless. People sure love their easy nostalgia, it was just kinda boring and unimaginative to me though. Can we actually get good characters and storytelling rather than hollow, empty-calorie fanwank?

I guess this was really made for fans who want to point and go ""I recognize that"". 

Well, I recognize Ghostbusters II, Ghostbusters videogame, and ghostbusters tv show eraser. I have no reverence to the original and took it as a silly, supernatural comedy that so happen to turn into a franchise, but this movie treats it like an important modern mythology and I'm baffled. Guys, it's just a movie about schlubby SNL actors farting around and hunting ghosts. Even the 2016 version knew this and followed that spirit even if it's mileage varied.

I know people have hardcore nostalgia for it, but that‚Äôs really what it is, and ultimately why the Force Awakens model doesn‚Äôt translate as well to a franchise like this. It‚Äôs not a sprawling cinematic epic saga, it‚Äôs a Bill Murray comedy. 

God it almost hurts to say but the 2016 movie definitely got the tone of Ghostbusters down more than this did.

So we have yet another 80's zombie franchise feature that desperately tries to buy its audiences' love rather than earn it organically with tons of references, call backs, fan service, and the characters aimlessly wondering around trying to solve mysteries the audience already knows because they decided to more-or-less copy the plot of the original and serve no purpose other than to hype up said fan service.

Too bad they couldn't find and open the trap that said ""good script"".

I am so sick of modern sequels to older films using nostalgia and fan service as a crutch over actually telling a compelling story, expanding the world, and moving the franchise forward. Hence, we are left with a sequel to a 30+ year old film that still leaves us back at square one.

I know this will turn heads, but I actually thought this was worse than Ghostbusters 2016. That film was also bad, don't get me wrong, but at least that film tried (read: tried) to do shake things up and not rely so heavily on reminding you of how great and influential the original film was.

My wife bought tickets to this one that I didn‚Äôt even know existed and I agreed to go.  Having not seen any trailers and not having an inkling of the idea of what it would be about, I thought the opening scene was pretty interesting.  

I was aware of Harold Ramis‚Äôs passing, so I picked up on him being the shadowy human in the beginning pretty quickly, and also that he was the ghost in the house once the family moved in.

The rest of this movie dragged pretty hard for me.  I know I‚Äôm supposed to suspend my disbelief, but these kids basically just pick up pieces of advanced technology and immediately know how to use them, which was pretty dumb.  The oldest kid (15, from a poor family in NY) somehow fixes a car using no money, with somehow knowledge of tools, on a car that likely needs a new carburetor from sitting around forever.

The Mom must live on welfare because she never has an inkling of being employed.  

The whole setup to me was just turn off your brain and consume product.  

The characters were just tropes to fit the story.  We have a kid named podcast who literally never gets a name other than podcast, who then proceeds to record a podcast the entire remainder of the movie.  His name is literally his only character trait.

And it wouldn‚Äôt be complete without the deus ex machina ending with the OG crew appearing out of thin air at just the right place and time despite the plot hole of them having been cleaned out by Spengler before he left town, and then all clearly having retired and moved on to other things, only to show up with all their gear to the middle of bumfuck nowhere to save the day.

Things don‚Äôt happen until an hour in and then it‚Äôs just copy and pasted parts from the original but with none of the actual support from the film to make them work (what was the point of the stay puff marshmallows besides just ‚Äúit happened in the first movie).

Lastly, I thought the overuse of Ghost Ego crossed a line, and it felt more exploitive then loving tribute. I thought just having his granddaughter in the movie was very fitting and proper tribute, but the whole plot is about him and how everyone thinks he‚Äôs an asshole, even the original Ghostbusters and it feels a little weird.

hl7thrb,"Man, as a HUGE GB fan, (GB is my all-time favorite movie, I grew up on RGB as my favorite cartoon and EGB, etc.,) I am sooo conflicted.

**TL/DR:** Feels like an indie movie with a GB tacked on. Wish protagonists had been adults. Wish the scale of the film had felt bigger/more high stakes. Wish last act wasn't rushed to make room for useless early character development with no payoff. LOVED the Egon tie in and final scene with Egon.

**Overall:**

The overall plot was solid but the execution was severely flawed IMO. I loved the strong tribute to Ramis (Egon was always my fav, and I would've missed him sorely without the plot that centered around him) but I would've loved to see Egon's grown daughter and Paul Rudd acting as the protagonists, not a bunch of kids. 

Some of the past attempted GB reboots' plots/scripts  involved ""passing the torch"" stories with other adult actors, maybe comedians. I really wish they would've went this route. I was fully expecting to see Paul Rudd suit up and *not* become the new Louis Tully. This was really disappointing. 

Imagine if Egon's daughter(not grand daughter) and Paul Rudd as the love interest had stood in for the kids, i.e., if adults were making the discoveries and progressing the plot. It would've been a much better film IMO. The kid's dialog for their ages was unbelievable, especially Podcast and Phoebe. The adolescent/pubescent love interest BS doesn't belong in a GB film. 

The film felt too small-scale for a GB film. The (way too long) first act was like an entirely different (boring) small town teen indie film. Once supernatural shit started to ensue, no one seemed to notice or care (the characters or even on the local/national scale.) The kids blew up half the town chasing a ghost...nothing happens, no on cares??

**Pros:**

* Loved the strong plot tie to Egon. Definitely got choked up in the scene with his ghost. That made the whole movie worth it for me. 
* Paul Rudd was good but under/incorrectly utilized
* Nicely shot/good cinematography and art direction, etc.
* Loved seeing the guys on screen again
* All the action sequences felt rushed while the small-scale teen drama stuff  was drug out...this isn't a fuckin' CW show
* I loved all the post-credit Winston stuff that tried to further the story for a potential sequel, wish it had been in the movie and less  BS in the first act. 

**Cons:** 

* The initial shot of the OG GBs was kinda sad. They looked really REALLY old and tired. I think the reveal could've been handled better. Wish more care had been put into their presentation.A little makeup and touch up can go a long way. This is a fantasy after all. Make them look 50 instead of 70. I dunno. Winston looked good but black don't crack.
* The plot was basically a remake of the first film, but less interesting
* The Stranger Things kid and his GF character were complete throwaways‚Äînot needed. 
* The jail scene...they don't put kids in jail. If they had gone with older protagonists, this would've made a lot more sense. Overall a weird and worthless scene.
* Some of the kid's GB knowledge seemed to come from nowhere...they did ""research"" or something. Podcast never heard of the GBs before but somehow throughout the rest of the film became an encyclopedia of GB knowledge.
* Small town setting was odd...even if it starts there...once crazy shit starts happening, go national! Show a news broadcast or something to give the plot some gravity. 
* On that previous point, overall, the characters seemed to not seriously react to the magnitude and seriousness of the plot. When Phoebe has a ghost playing chess with her, she doesn't seem affected, even though she states that she doesn't believe in ghosts. When Paul Rudd releases a demon from the trap, he doesn't care and doesn't even mention it afterwards? Even though he was initially really interested in the trap. They all just went about their normal lives and do nothing. WTF? I thought the next scene was going to be Paul and the kids scheming to figure out what to do. Instead, Paul‚Äôs plot gets sidelined, trying to date the Mom
* Final act felt extremely rushed after a first act that dragged on establishing characters with no ultimate payoff
* Paul being a shitty teacher was not redeeming or funny‚Äîodd choice.
* Original cast was under utilized...would've appreciated a connecting scene (after the scene where Phoebe phones Ray from jail) where Ray sees a news report about the crazy clouds and supernatural mayhem in OK and then Ray calls Peter (with Dana there) and Winston or something like that. Just something to explain how the the OG GBs get there at the end.
* A lot of people thought there was too much fan service, I don't agree. I just think that the fan service that *was* included was odd and too on the nose. Things like the vertical book stacking in Egon's house (why??) the bible lines spray painted at the farm, (Egon is too methodical to do crazy stuff like that) etc.
* Some of the dialog (especially Ray's) was stilted and badly written mimicry of the original script 
* No Slimer
* The origins/reasoning behind the mini staypufts was unexplained. Something as simple as ""Gozer likes to repeat forms it's already taken.."" would have made them make more sense.
* The new ""muncher"" ghost is unexplained. Why was he there to begin with?
* Sigourney cameo wasted on post credit scene???
* No Rick Moranis...bummer  


**Questions:**

* Why did Ray say the firehouse was a Starbucks when it clearly wasn't?
* Why would Egon pack up and leave the power grid unattended in the firehouse?
* Ray says Egon took all the packs, but they OG GBs all show up with packs...how?
* How do you make a GB movie and not have at least a cameo with Slimer? I think an interaction or post credit scene where Ray or Venkman has secretly been keeping Slimer as a pet (when he ostensibly hates him) would've been cute and great fan service
* I feel like a lot more was shot with the original cast that was cut. Can't wait for the blu ray to hopefully see that stuff.

And what doesn't make sense is the whole secrecy thing about the Ghostbusters.  If I remember the original correctly, New York was destroyed by the marshmallow.  As if nobody's going to remember that?  I don't understand the plot at all.

And the cameos are cringe.  They're just awful.",qx6sxk

hl7z89l,"I thought it was a good family film. Definitely a lot more appropriate for younger audiences than any of the other films. (Not a single dream sequence involving spectral fellatio).  Is the fact the sidekick kid gave himself the nickname ""Podcast"" cringy?  1000%.  But then you just move past it.  Does it feel a little lazy that they are just rehashing a lot of the plot from the original film?  Sure, but for the under 15 crowd who hasn't seen the original, they won't know.  Does the movie give us as fans of an actor, writer & director who made some of the most influential comedies of the 70s, 80s, & 90s a chance to say thank you and good bye? Yup (although the text ""for Harold"" shows up too early and feels clunky but I guess they wanted to get it in before the upbeat music kicks in).

At the end of the day, only people who love to be negative will say they hated this movie/wasted their money/will never get that 2 hours back.  The rest of us will be like, ""that film was alright."" And that's how I feel: that it was alright.  7/10.",qx6sxk

Paul Rudd knows about ghostbusting, and decides to open a trap (dumb but maybe), lets out something huge, then just forgets about it...why does this happen? This is an issue that he as an adult caused and knows he needs to fix. He doesnt even tell the mom about it.",qx6sxk
hlgn1q2,"It was fun. I liked it overall. But there were some things that really fucking bugged me...

* Gozer was too...corporeal. Gozer worked in the first one because we knew just enough for it to be a threat. This one didn't pull that off well. If everything was the same down to the keymaster and gatekeeper, then where was the traveler? Gozer always takes the form of a traveler to roast shubs and zuuls in its depths!
* The ghostbusters couldn't hit Gozer with a proton beam in the first one. It jumped away, then disappeared and became a booming voice in the sky, then a marshmallow man. They also didn't cross the streams on Gozer, they crossed the streams and closed the gateway that allowed Gozer to exert influence in our plane.
* They keymaster and gatekeeper were integral to opening the gateway, but since Gozer was already completely here, why would trapping one kneecap it? It was a cool idea to trap one or both of them before they could open the gateway, sure, but after?
* Making the boinking of the keymaster and gatekeeper part of the process really didn't feel necessary.
* Ivo Shandor's appearance was completely fucking pointless. ""We can rule the world!"" Are you kidding me? Shandor tried to summon Gozer with the tower in NYC because he felt the world was too sick to go on after WW1.
* No one but Egon ever went down into that mine in the 80 or so years it had been abandoned? Really? No one else found the temple, the weird shit in it, the pit, Snow White Shandor, none of it? Fuck off.
* The pop-out temple was more than a little absurd.
* Why would Shandor build both the tower and the mine temple, but keep himself in the mine? Hell, why build two separate ways to summon Gozer in the first place? In the first one it felt more like Shandor was a brilliant nut who just happened to get it right. In this one it was like some sure-thing master plan bullshit.
* Trapping Gozer was a fucking absurdly stupid plan! You don't trap Gozer, you get Gozer the fuck out of our reality! Trapping it just buys time, and when Gozer inevitably gets out, guess what? It's still here.
* Muncher was fun, but no slimer? NO SLIMER?? All of the other fanservice and no slimer cameo??",qx6sxk

hldd5j3,"Afterlife is an absolutely solid movie that just doesn't quite reach great heights in my opinion, and that problem is for me entirely rooted in the movie robbing its main characters of resolution.

Yes. Ghost Egon hugs his daughter and that thread is resolved, likewise he helps/says bye to Phoebe and the other OG guys, but after he dissolves to dust, the movie straight up *ends.* Like, Gozer was defeated about 2 minutes beforehand it felt like, and you got every ghost ever caught up in all those traps which I presume need dealing with. Plus, Summerville is still kind of in shock at everything. Where was the wrap up? Where was the decompression? The return to normal? Showing the family fitting in to the town. Showing them renovating the house? Showing them becoming successful and accepted? I'm glad they got personal resolution with Egon, but the movie introduces a lot of other elements outside of this with Summerville that it straight up ignores.

Instead, everything after that moment is reserved entirely for the OG Ghostbusters. The first mid credits scene is a fun little nugget with Dana and Venkman, which is nice but....it's just a self contained thing. Then the final scene is Winston buying the old Firehouse and a tease that the containment vessel has failed. Which I feel is all well and good for post credits stuff, but I'm just miffed that the characters we followed for the entire movie who had won me over kind of got shafted in the story circle department.

The reunion of the original ghostbusting crew was nice, and I liked how the ghost of the dad (sorry can‚Äôt remember his name) was so cool. All in all I do think this was nice, I think it was actually better than the 2016 one not saying that one was bad.

The film was a fun ride as well. Not too sure how it‚Äôll go with sequels but the kids were all enjoyable and played their parts well.
I love Bill Murray but got a little upset thinking towards the end that he was the 1 person holding up everyone else for a ghostbusters 3 with the original gang. His disdain for part 2 has always irked me (part 2 is a fantastic sequel) and his treatment of Harold Ramis was shocking (although they did speak towards the end and mended old wounds).

Nevertheless, it stood on its own enough for me.

That said (and this is not a criticism; more so an observation), everyone's reaction to seeing a ghost for the first time is surprisingly lax. I get that in their world, ghosts are a proven entity and not purely just spiritual beings, but whether it was the sentient marshmallows or the moving lights/chess set in the house, everyone just shrugged their shoulders to what was going on around them when I feel like it would've spooked them even a little in basically any other movie.",qx6sxk

On the phone, Ray seemed to say they lost the Firehouse, and that it became a Starbucks.

Then in the after-credit scene, Winston brings back the Ecto-1 there, and it's not a Starbucks, it's just abandonned.

I'm guessing Winston actually kept paying the bills for the place, couldn't have sold it to anyone ever, since the Containment Unit is still there, and I'm guessing further that it can't be cheap to keep the Containment Grid powered up for 30+ years.

And now that Egon's gone, I'm also guessing that it means virtually nobody knows how to fix it... say... if the red light started blinking for some reason.

Honestly, if there's another sequel, I would cream myself if they add Kylie Griffin, Eduardo Rivera, Roland Jackson and Garrett Miller. Ok, mostly Kylie.

When the 2016 Ghostbusters received bad critic reviews and a worse audience score, the studio blamed it on white male virgins who hate women and want to watch the world burn. They called for audience scores to be    removed, and were caught removing all comments criticizing the film on legitimate terms, so that it looked like the only negativity fit this narrative spin.

hlkkli4,"I must be one of the few who didn't get much out of this flick. McKenna Grace and Paul Rudd kept things interesting, but as the film went on and on, it just became more and more about ""honoring"" the original film and its lore. Which wholly disinterested me. I grew up loving the original flick and its sequel, but-- if this makes any sense-- I don't want a film that reproduces the original or cashes in on it for vibes. I want a film that provides the same fresh imagination and genre-splicing that the original did.

It also feels to me like all post-1984 GB projects fall into this pit of plot gravity, where they can't help but eventually just become reproductions of the original. I liked *GB II*, but it's a schematic retread of the original, beat for beat. The video game that was released a few years back very deliberately redid the Gozer thing-- that game, like this film, also has a bizarre fixation on Ivo Shandor as inherently interesting, as opposed to a throwaway line from the original. And the reboot, as much as it acted like it was its own thing, went right back to where we started, with a possessed dork instigating a kaiju ghost threat in the middle of NYC.

Is this really all the ""Ghostbusters"" idea is good for?

The CG Ramis was needless, because by that point both characters who had an emotional plot thread to the character had *already resolved those threads*. Which meant Ramis (and the older Ghostbusters) were there for us, an indulgence to wet our eyes. (You especially didn't need Ray and Co. returning, since all they do is, ya know, lasso Gozer for a bit, which was already happening anyway.) And frankly I just didn't like looking at him. It's not a tribute to him. His ghost is a fetish object for people who value *respect to the original* most of all.

[It's super-weird to me that Reitman and Ramis (by proxy) become the loci of this idea of taking the original material seriously, when they were the ones who brought Aykroyd's sky-high ambitions down to earth and contextualized them into a working-class slobs vs. snobs comedy.]

I'm sure it'd be easy to say I'm overthinking it or something. I'm definitely not here to rain on parades, just offering a take. And I didn't hate the flick. Jason Reitman has a keen eye for replicating that shameless Amblin attitude he's chasing, where every hour is golden hour, and fields of wheat look like a big warm blanket. He directs McKenna Grace to a fantastic performance. She's winning and sharp. I liked that underground temple set when it was bas relief. (Though I'm not sure what to make of the implication that Shandor was involved with Hiroshima/Nagasaki (I don't know any other way to read ""1945"").)

Also, Paul Rudd was fantastic. Of all the efforts to honor and evoke the original, his light, scruffy nerd charm comes off best. He has the right attitude, enthusiastic but cheeky.

And his admiration for and encouragement of Grace's science is something that I love seeing imparted to children. We have enough movies for kids that are functionally power fantasies. And while I guess this one is too (by the end, the heroine possesses the godlike power to, uh, restrain gods), it's founded on the idea that science is fuckin' awesome and helps us understand the world.",qx6sxk

hln023d,"I think this movie suffered from poor directing. The scary scenes felt harmless and most of the action fell flat. The best part of the movie was the chase downtown to capture the ghost and even then it didn't feel amazing after they finally got him. Even in the original ghostbusters when they first catch slimer or the scolari bros in GBII the movie tuned triumphant once they bagged the ghost. In GB:A it just felt like they were handing us things we wanted and going ""here you go, dont complain, this is the best youre gonna get"" It made me realize what I want is there to have been a GBIII made in 95 with chris farley like they wanted. 

On top of all that, the third act felt underwhelming, felt like a lot of the movie got edited out to keep the run time down, bill murray clearly didn't want to be there, they used ghost egon too much, the dialogue for the OG ghostbusters felt very hammy and it felt odd that they were like ""good job kids, were taking the ecto 1 and the equipment back to NYC"". Instead of passing the torch, it felt like the torch was out and they lit it again with the OG crew on the idea that there's gonna be sequels where what, we get new recruits in NYC?

I love ghostbusters, and my love for bustin ghosts definitely put rose colored glasses on this otherwise kind of boring movie. I say all this while fully acknowledging I would buy it and watch it again.  The kids were great, the storyline was great, the effects were excellent. The music and direction kinda had me bumming and the ending felt cut short and confusing. That being said, there were ghosts, they got busted, the OG crew was there so i guess the movie was just enough.

And I just can't imagine there being any universe where Harold Ramis would have been okay with his likeness being used like that in the end.

Both post-credits scenes also just felt really...weird. You have one that must have been shot in Sigourney Weaver's apartment when she had a day off, and then the one with Potts and Hudson that was really strangely edited and felt like it was building up to something only for there to be no payoff.",qx6sxk
hle5x9k,"Did jason forget his dad made an adult film with Ghostbusters.

His was just another kids film with desperate humour in it.paul rydd while clearly a nice guy has to be the most boring comedic  actor out there .

Why the need for so many callbacks? 

I know this is a Ghostbusters film because I chose to watch it. 

If anyone loves this film that's great that means it wasnt a waste of time however if you think its a well made film you're an idiot. I dont care if it had good intentions that's not enough to hold a film together with its shit references.

Plus naming a character podcast just because he has a podcast is actually retarded.",qx6sxk

hlkju8w,This movie sucked ass. Kids were terrible actors and the characters were terribly written. They basically put the brains of 40 year olds into the bodies of 12-15 year olds.,qx6sxk
hl8o4at,"Saw it tonight with the kids.  Collection of random thoughts:

--I had a ton of fun with this.  Admittedly, I am in the mood for nostalgia right now.  The recent past hasn't been that great, the future ain't looking too great, let's have some goddamn fun.  The movie delivered.  I was there on opening weekend to see Ghostbusters as a seven year old in 1984 (the librarian ghost scared the shit out of me), and it was special to take my kids to go see a sequel on the big screen.

--It skews young.  It may be PG-13, but other than some innuendo I think it's mainly targeting the pre-teen demographic.

-- This feels like less of a sequel to the original than a re-imagining.  It's maybe 50% Ghostbusters, but also 50% Stranger Things, 50% Goonies, 50% Goosebumps, 50% Super8, and 50% Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  A very big movie!

--The cameos are off the fucking hook.  Olivia Wilde as Gozer?!!?!?!? YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Behrooz's mom voicing Gozer (I imagine they had to try to make her voice sound less gravelly than it actually is in real life) and J.K. Simmons in a hysterical cameo as the resurrected Ivo Shandor??!?!? All great. And, of course, it was amazing to see the original Ghostbusters again, including the late Harold Ramis in a surprisingly extended appearance in ghost form (I think they maybe kept his spirit around a little too long ... just a little ... I would have cut his time down to the bare acknowledgements).  I also liked the earlier Ramis appearance when we don't really see him.  

--If this is the last time we see the Ghostbusters suit up, what a way to go out.  It feels like closure.  

--Ernie Hudson, despite being significantly older than Murray and Aykroyd, looks at least ten years younger.  

--They really put in some effort to make this movie not feel pinned down to a specific time period, which I appreciated.  For example, you don't see much cell phone usage, the tech we see is straight out of the 80s and early 90s, they aped a lot of the visual cues of the original, and it's set in an old town where everything seems like it dates back to the late 20th century.  Some would say too many visual cues are taken from the original, but you know what, fucking slather it on.  Just turn on that nostalgia IV drip and plug it directly into my goddamn veins.

--The scene where they take Ecto-1 out the first time just had me grinning ear to ear.  

--The gal playing Spengler's grand-daughter stole the show.  It's rare that a kid actor makes a positive impression on me, but she was amazing.  Her mom was pretty great, too.  

--The family stuff was maybe a bit too bitter.  Like, I get why Egon felt he had to do what he did, but he can't try to explain it to his daughter?  Maybe at least keep in touch?  I wish they'd worked in a few throwaway lines from mom about her dad ""raving nonsense about the end of the world until I finally changed my number and started throwing away his letters.""  

--Rudd is fun in this.  Everyone is fun!

--The kid's exploring Spengler's house and the mineshaft has a Hardy Boys/Goosebumps mystery vibe to it that I did not expect, but which I found completely welcome.  When the different facets of Spengler's plan are revealed, I found myself oddly engrossed.  One of my biggest problems with Ghostbusters 2 is that it tried to replicate the beats of the first.  While that can work for some properties, I don't think it worked for Ghostbusters.  I was happily surprised they went with a radically different tone.

--Did I mention how fucking great it was to see that Olivia Wilde shows up as Gozer.  Goddamn.  

--I think the script is more clever than many will give it credit for.  Yeah, there are unending callbacks, but there were also some subtle bits that I appreciated.  For example, adults in the movie, by and large, don't doubt that ghosts exist, they just think no one has seen them since ""all that business in New York.""  I mean, this makes perfect sense, right?  After the events of GB 1 and 2, there's no adult in the world who wouldn't accept that the supernatural exists.  Additionally, this movie realizes that Gozer had NOT been destroyed at the end of GB1, merely sent back through the gate, something I don't think I realized until decades after I saw the original.

--Surprisingly, I thought Akroyd did a lot better interacting with the new folks than Murray or Hudson.  He was good on the Phone Call Everyone Who Saw The Trailer Was Waiting For‚Ñ¢ and he had a couple great lines with the podcast kid.  The most enthusiasm and energy Murray showed was when he was chatting with Sigourney Weaver or Olivia Wilde.  Hmmm ... I guess that makes sense ...

--I was super surprised Potts didn't show up again until the credits.  I was also surprised that Dickless didn't have some sort of cameo where he says ""I've got them this time,"" or some such.  

--I guess they're thinking of setting up a sequel with the second after credits scene?  I'd be there, but we'll see if it happens.

--Goddamn is there nothing like the sound of a proton pack firing up.  

--I am very, very happy that they didn't have a giant monster in this. That was one nostalgia-well I didn't need to dip back into.

--The gatekeeper tearing away her dowdy outfit to reveal the beautiful gold dress (and her hair and makeup were suddenly perfect) was fucking great. Is the gatekeeper/keymaster stuff ever not awesome?

--I imagine the appearance of the original Ghostbusters so late in the movie will be polarizing. I actually would have preferred if they had shown up maybe five to ten minutes earlier (during the flight from the mountain), but it's a delicate balance. You want to give them their moment without them taking over the film. It wasn't perfect, but I think it worked more than it didn't work. Sure, they helped out, but it was a team effort. The return of folks that started it all didn't, in my opinion, detract from what Rey or Finn had accomplished in the movie thus far, and it would have felt weird for Luke not to appear on Starkiller base. Oh wait, sorry, I mixed up my movies there for a moment. 

--This movie won't be for everyone, and I totally get that. Sure, it's got an unexpected feel and vibe to it and some surprisingly heavy family stuff, but on the other hand it's heavily toned towards nostalgia-overload-fun, and I imagine some won't care for that.",qx6sxk
hm4hgl3,"I'm clearly in the minority on this one but I don't know. The pieces are all here but it's like, in service of what? It's strange seeing a CGI ghost of an elderly Harold Ramis that looks nothing like how the man looked when he actually was old. It's weird seeing toys being sold of his strange cgi ghost self. It feels so strange to deify Spengler in this way, when Ramis's work always skewed towards nihilism and the mundane.  


This doesn't feel like a loving tribute to me, it feels like that aspect was a shroud to cover the more cynical motivations of this film, namely trying to erase the fraught legacy of 2016 and jumpstart a bunch of planned sequels and merchandise. It just makes me sad that there's some properties we end up loving to death, and so long as there's profit involved we can't let them just exist on their own. It also makes me sad that the scifi genre has almost completely been swallowed by these huge franchises, and there's no more funny little stories like the original Ghostbusters coming out these days.

hlgd9df,"There was potential for a good movie in here. It wasn‚Äôt good but I still left happy I saw it. And, honestly, teared up a tad at ghost Ramis. The should have leaned way more into the Gooniesbuster aspect of the story or given more for Coons/Rudd to do. 

The good: 

-The kid who played Phoebe/little Egon is fantastic. If that kid was a stock, I‚Äôd invest because she‚Äôs going places. 

-Carrie Coons is always good. Even with not much to work with here. As is Paul Rudd.

-The kid from Stranger Things wasn‚Äôt annoying. The casting is very good. No one stood out that was just out of place. Even the Podcasting kid wasn‚Äôt awful. 

-It was nice to see the 4 of them back together one last time. 


The bad:

-The story doesn‚Äôt really make much sense. Ray and the other Ghostbusters just ignore Egon when Egon figures out Shandor built a temple to Gozer in Oklahoma? Egon was the one who figured the original shite out. And Egon would just wing trying to capture the Keymaster/gatekeeper to attract Gozer with no back up plan or message to anyone what he planned/was going down? 

-And Egon just dumping his family? They never explain why. Did he fear Gozar‚Äôs minions would go after her? Who knows. We see a pinboard that shows us Egon did care about his daughter but never why he abandoned her. 

-The story becomes beats taken from the original movie. Just lazy writing. Lots of scenes/bits had nice set ups that didn‚Äôt really go anywhere. And it was weird to me how everyone apparently blew off the original Ghostbusters but no one seemed weirded out by the fact that, after the temple is opened, Ghosts start showing up. And Rudd actually digs the original Ghostbusters and thinks it‚Äôs a good idea to open a trap found at Spengler‚Äôs farm? Requiring a character to be a moron for plot‚Äôs sake never works. 

-They could have gone sooooo many ways with the idea that Shandor had back up plans/ideas bit and just swerved back to recycle. 

-Im a big fan of fan service. I think giving people what they want is cool. But the Easter eggs in this one like Janeane Melnitz showing up for one scene, doing nothing and that‚Äôs it we‚Äôre just lame. There‚Äôs a fine line between Fan service and ‚Äúplease please please like us more than that awful Feig movie.‚Äù

-It could have been way funnier. The best comedy bits are from lil Egon. And Murray at the end. I hope he got his cocoa and booze.

hld4try,"I absolutely loved it, but would have loved it more without the eye-roll inducing forced nostalgia. Movies don't let you be nostalgic anymore; they slap you in the face with references now. Why did Egon have a firepole down to his lab? He wasn't excited for a firepole. They didn't ask for a firepole. They didn't install one. It came with the shitty firehouse they bought because Ray ruined a bargain with his excitement. The Revelations 7:12 all over the farm? I didn't know Egon was super religious, or that he was in the car with Ray and Winston when that talk happened. The damn Twinkie in the glove compartment. ""Who you gonna call."" The commercial weirdly playing while Phoebe is calling Ray. Shit like that was just bad.

I also can't believe that the only guys fighting spirits from other dimensions treated one of their own like he was going crazy because he discovered another apocalyptic event coming. It seemed out of character for all four of the guys. It felt forced to make the story of how Egon ends up in Summerville happen. 

Anyway, all of the Star Wars level bullshit nostalgia could have been removed, and the movie would have been better. The scenes with Ray were great. The guys were great at the end. The stuff with Egon was great. Phoebe and Callie dealing with who Egon was and what they meant to him, and Phoebe finding herself was the best part. The entire cast ruled, and the main story is what really made it work, not all the annoying winking and nudging. 

This isn't the Ghostbusters movie I wanted as a fan, but it's a damn good one. I just really need GB to NOT become Star Wars. We saw what fan whining and fan catering did to those last three SW movies.",qx6sxk
hle479f,"
- some spoilers ahead- 
  The story was a perfect GB3 sequel, the execution not so much. Very much tailored to children 10 and under, played way too safe. Not one character in the entire movie acted scared, even surprised, by any of the phenomena happening. Sadly, there werent a lot of ‚Äúghosts‚Äù either and the few that we see were not particularly scary, even creatively weird (ex- OG librarian ghost). As shitty as the 2016 GB was, I can say atleast it was packed with ghosts and weird creatures.  I think what bummed me out the most was reitman had an extra 2 years to really polish & refine this movie before release and it didnt feel like he did that. So many oddly glossed over actions ( they trash the town trying to catch muncher, almost killing a few people and then theyre just released with barely a scolding by what should have been dave chappelle as the police chief)
    It was Visually awesome & the soundtrack was spot on and damn if it wasnt awesome to see all 4 of the originals next to each other bustin ghosts again- that was great. I also really dug the cult temple scenes and it wouldve been great if the townspeople were either descendants of shandor or atleast under some sort of cult like spell towards the end.  
    Regardless, imo, the story itself was better than the final product and I am happy with that. Whoever wrote this screenplay did a great job. Not a bad sequel at all.",qx6sxk

Afterlife was a fun family film full of heart and soul that I havent seen or felt in a very long time. Can't wait to see what comes next.",qx6sxk
hmjw7ao,"This is one of the most, ""It's a movie,"" movies I've ever watched. It does such equal parts good and equal parts bad that it's just super middle of the road. So much is rooted in nostalgia and trying to have a similar setup of multiple busters that the entire Finn Wolfhard plotline is meaningless and his love interest even moreso; it's like they had a quota of, ""We need 4 kids in suits,"" and just hastily wrote a ""plot"" in for two of them.

The jokes fall flat (not that the original is an outright comedy, but you get some genuine laughs vs this), three of the four child actors aren't great (McKenna Grace is pretty solid, but I didn't like her character much either since it felt a bit oddly written, but that's not on her), and the movie kind of never finds its footing. BUT it also has a lot of really fun moments like the discovery of the old devices and the car chase that really are pretty well done and entertaining.

Also can we talk about the weird suicidal Stay Puff scene? It felt so out of place and just like, ""We need to reference them.""

This was basically what I expected for the last 2 years that I've been bombarded with trailers for it at the theater. I didn't expect to see JK Simmons completely wasted though and Olivia Wilde pop up as Gozer; it made me wind up just rooting for Olivia Wilde in the end since she's cool and attractive and our main characters are all so lame.

This movie has absolutely no need to exist and sadly it knows that through and through. It's tying up loose ends that didn't need tying up and also setting up a new set of movies that no one really asked for especially when done in this particular way and style. It just kind of exists in this weird space between both ends of the spectrum and left me feeling no real way about it as I left the theater since for every good thing that I liked there was one equally bad thing to just negate it.",qx6sxk

Did not feel that they needed to go back to the Gozer well to find a villain either. The old Real Ghostbusters cartoon and even Ghostbusters 2 shows there are plenty of supernatural non-Gozer villains that work.

Lots of disjointed scenes that did not seem to fit together well. Kind of scenes that might have worked in an 8 episode mini series where there's time to let the story breathe, but here just seemed rushed and unnecessary. Sheriff dad shows up and then never really referenced again. Why is Phoebe in summer school???

Kids need boundaries. It helps them grow. Confidence isn‚Äôt something you just have, it‚Äôs something that is built up over time. My wife keeps saying that these ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù movies are sending a false message to young girls about how to handle things in life. It doesn‚Äôt teach them about failure, and rising from failure to become a better woman. It basically teaches them to talk down to others (even if they‚Äôre adults) and just DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

They'd at least have checked it out.",qx6sxk
hllkfs8,"Just saw it. Now for my take on it that nobody really asked for.

I loved it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have it's flaws. In fact I would say it succeeds despite it's flaws.

What could have been better:

Why have those cooks so prominently at the beginning if they were going to be forgotten about instantly? They could have made entertaining members of the ""team"" if done right.

Why have Finn's character have a whole sub plot where he applied for and worked at the fast food joint? Nothing was gained from that. In fact I would have substituted more stuff with the old Ghostbusters . More on that in a second.

Why is Podcast so good at controlling the RC while the Ecto-1 is moving? And why does he have the goggles down when he does? No way that helps him drive it. Unless there was something cut out of the movie.

The Ghostbusters showing up at the end, while a great moment, ended up feeling a little cheesy and a tad bit empty. This would have felt better I think, if they had built it up more. Instead of Finn working at the food joint, we could have had a scene or two of Ray calling up or visiting the other Ghostbusters they could have even left it ambiguous if they were going to agree to help. I think that it would have given their return and triumph more ""umph"". I think a ""where are they now"" moment with everybody would have been great for the older fans.

The whole Gozer retread, while fine, felt rushed in this one. The whole shandor being their made little sense. Why did he spend so much to build the building in NYC if it could have happened there the whole time?

Now the good

All the characters felt great. No exceptions. Particularly the main girl. I could be wrong but I felt that she was supposed to be on the spectrum. I applaud the movie for that portrayal while also not hitting you over the head with it.

Paul Rudd played the same character as usual, which for any other actor would be bad, but he is just so God damn likeable and funny. Which brings me to....

The comedy, while having a different feel from the originals, was still very enjoyable. A great balance of comedy and seriousness.

The ghosts, in particular the Demon Dogs looked really good, and in fact at moments I wasn't entirely sure if CG or practical effects.

The gadgets. Diverse and different while still looking like they would have belonged in the original films. Of course I grew up with the cartoons and they looked like concepts straight from the toy shelves and cartoons.

Of course seeing the OG crew return was phenomenal. The moments where the OG crew reacts to Egon felt genuine, in particular Dan's. I would definitely bet on the fact that all he had to do was conjure up memory of back when they made the original films together. His reaction in particular is what made tipped the scale from cheesy to meaningful to me. It really felt like he was living in the past in that moment, even if Harold Ramos wasn't actually their when they were filming that scene.

This one will definitely enter into my Ghostbusters viewing rotation. That's for sure.

Edit: I just realized I contradicted myself when it came to the Original cast 

I would like to differentiate the two comments in that I think the first time I mention it, it's how I would have done it differently, and when you take emotion out of the equation, it's how I feel the scene falls a bit flat, whereas in the food section, I'm talking moreso about the raw feeling of seeing them together once more in their suits and doing their thing, which is a moment nobody thought we would ever see again.",qx6sxk

The reboot/monstrosity in 2016 got turned off after 20 minutes. 

So I hoped this would be better and god damn it was. Maybe it‚Äôs my age (45 now) but this threw me right back to the feelings I had watching the original, and the feelings I had from those great 80‚Äôs classic movies. The comments in here are slating Podcast but he would not have been out of place in any of those earlier films. I‚Äôm not going to over think it and deconstruct the story and acting. It was all fine in my opinion. Movies are made to be enjoyed and this absolutely hit the nail on the head for me. I can see younger audiences being a bit jaded by it but anyone from my era would probably love it. The respect shown to Egon and Harold Ramis was amazing. It was handled with care and not overdone. The cries of it being a rehash of the first movie are falling on deaf ears to me. This story made sense, a couple of plot holes aside as I do agree Ray of all people would have never doubted Egon, but their old nemesis returning and Egon taking a stand is the perfect way to continue the story and bring in fresh blood so the franchise can move forward on its own two feet now. Amazing work.",qx6sxk

Characterization was nice for Phoebe and her mom, but everyone was kind of just there especially Lucky who just exists to be a crush for Trevor. Nostalgia was also relied on a hell of a lot, but still the way Harold Ramis is treated is nothing, but respectable and everyone mention (I felt a bit teary eye myself) crying toward the end.

I do really hope to see a sequel just to explore more Ghostbusters lore especially with Gozer finally be moved on from. I feel like there are a lot more interesting supernatural stories that can be told and the kids (Mckenna Grace) definitely feel like they grow up in the role, while having some of the original Ghostbusters still around.

hm3x1wh,"Just saw it today. Initial reaction was it was a cute nostalgia trip.    

I can't help but feel there was so much left on the cutting room floor of this film. Maybe they wanted to do reshoots but couldn't because of covid.      

Criticisms out of the way first. The aforementioned possible cuts. The editing seemed really strange in this movie. Just randomly cutting to different scenes. How does the mom take her kids to Oklahoma, and then mention they have been evicted? Did them packing everything they own into the car not clue them in? Did they not pack everything? I feel like that scene where she explains they need to move out and stay in Egon's place for a while got cut.     

Finn Wolfhard really just exists to attract the young viewers I guess. He is fine in the film, but his entire reason for being is to fix the car. Felt like anytime they realised he hadn't been on screen in a while they cut to him fixing the car.  

The walmart stuff. Jesus. That is when the movie takes a nose dive. From then on, it stops being Jason Reitman's film and becomes Sony's checklist of beats to hit for profit.    

>!The original Ghostbusters. Yikes. Honestly the finale would have been better without them. Ray's cameo in the book store, Venkman and Dana's at the end, and Winston reopening the firehouse would have been enough.!<     

>!When they show up at the end I felt the pacing just dragged. I felt they really didn't want to be there. Everything slowed down from what was a heroic moment, just so they could reference the first movie and for Bill Murray to crack wise. Ray mentions earlier Egon took all the equipment, packs, traps etc. So clearly he missed 3 because they each had one. It's fine, I get why they brought them back. It was a nice moment. But too long of a moment pacing wise.!<     

>!Having Gozer be the villain again. As soon as they mentioned that, I turned to my friend and said Paul Rudd and the mom are going to become dogs. Or Paul Rudd and Finn Wolfhard's love interest, to get him invested. I was technically right on both counts, but thank god they used the mom first because of that weird pre-sex scene in the desert. That felt out of nowhere.  Just why Gozer again?!<     

>!And the mine. In this day and age of urban exploration and smart phones etc, how have the teenagers of that town never gone down there? How is it not a famous spot? Gone viral for having a literal pit of ghosts!<      

Things I really liked about the movie, the cast. McKenna Grace was great, charming funny and totally carried the movie. I liked Finn Wolfhard, his character easily could have been moody teen but they wisely avoided it. Carrie Coon was okay. Her character was funny and cynical but didn't really have much to do. Paul Rudd was Paul Rudd. He is no Rick Moranis, but he was charming and watchable as always. Logan Kim was okay. He had good chemistry with McKenna Grace, but they didn't give him much outside of the podcast gimmick.   

The music was great. Taking the original score and making it grander and more heroic. Really cool. 

>!I thought they handled the Harold Ramis stuff pretty good at the beginning. And having him being a ghost guiding Phoebe was a cute idea. For someone who didn't believe in ghosts she wasted no time changing her mind. I wish there had have been more explanation as to who Egon's wife was. I assume it was Janine based on the trailer, but then their romance was dropped in ghostbusters 2, but this movie sort of ignores that movie (except for Ray's bookstore). He abandoned his family, and just never contacted them again?!<      

>!The handling of Egon at the end, his hand helping Phoebe with the proton pack was nice. I felt myself tearing up a little there, because it was a nice payoff. And I liked the mom getting to hug him. But that really should have been it. We didn't need to see his face as much as we did. It felt a little exploitive. A simple nod between him and the other ghostbusters would have sufficed. But it was still a nice moment.!<      

Overall, the movie was enjoyable. It was a nostalgia trip. Very similar to the Force awakens in that it sets up new directions to go but also reminds you of something you loved by basically remaking the 3rd act of the original. I feel like maybe now we have got it out of the way lets expand and tell different stories.    

>!Last note, what was with that gold coin scene from 1984 in the post credits? It felt so out of place. The rest of the scene was fine. Janine and Winston talking about his success, and him being the one to carry the torch. I really enjoyed that idea. That the outsider everyman of the original crew being the guy that wants to carry on the business. A ghostbusters INC. sequel could be a fun idea. Bring back the Spengler family and expand with a new crew under Winston's guidance. The cast was the highlight of this film so I will gladly watch more of them.!<    

EDIT: Formatting",qx6sxk
hmzxtb3,"Mixed bag of a movie. It's starts great, the kids discovering all the old stuff is fun and CGI Egon is handled good as well. But the movie kind of forgets to have a story of its own. Everything that happens is just straight up copy&paste of Ghostbusters1 elements. It doesn't even expand on them in any way or integrates them properly. Dogs, Marshmallow, Gozer and Co. just show up and are gone again. The movie  completely  ignoring Ghostbusters2 also feels weird, was there any reference at all?

The integretation of the original Ghostbusters also felt pretty ham-fisted, they show up in the last five minutes for no reason and that's it. No real explanation why they split up or why Egon went solo, when he had all the evidence necessary.

This movie feels like it has the heart in the right place, but the script was like a first draft hacked together on a coffee break. With a few more rewrites it might have been great, but as is it just leaves too many unanswered questions and doesn't have enough personality of it's own.",qx6sxk

While I really hate the sassy wonderkid role I think the kid who played Phoebe pulled it off great (looks a lot like Harold Ramis too), but those nods to ""hey I'm actually autistic"" were just awful. ""overstimulation calms me"" who wrote that shit?

I don't think Finn Wolfhard is ever gonna escape this genre to be honest, he should embrace being a Ghostbuster, seems like the kind of thing he'd love anyway. Paul Rudd too, a great second generation of Ghostbusters.

Oh yeah Podcast rocks too, very Dustin from Stranger Things like, he's gonna be a great Stantz type character. Back in New York for the next film it seems, not sure how they're gonna bring two kids born and raised in rural Oklahoma to NYC to be Ghostbusters but I'm sure they'll figure it out.",qx6sxk
hlaeobw,"Why did they leave the Ray Parker Jr theme for the very end credits?! I wanted it playing when Ecto 1 got kicked back into action and they're headed to the final battle, or Cleaning Up The Town could have equally worked for that one scene. Or they could've had Ray Parker Jr's theme for when the OG's and the kids teamed up. And now, this is a nitpick, but I really wanted On Our Own by Bobby Brown playing after the original theme in the end credits. 

Other than that, honestly no complaints. This movie was truly perfect. And me and my partner were absolutely hyped up and fanboying at most scenes. I found it hard to hold back tears at all the stuff with Egon. It truly was magical and Harold would be proud. 

Ghostbusters for life!",qx6sxk
hl8jd96,"I'm feeling really, really conflicted after my screening. This post is a way of working out some of those feelings.

I'm of two minds about this movie. I liked the first half and the fact that it felt like its own thing. It doesn't feel like ""Ghostbusters 3"" at all; it's more like a spin-off in the same universe. The country setting was a nice contrast to the NYC scenes in the first two movies, and the shots of Ecto-1 against the landscape looked beautiful. Then there was an abrupt switch in tone, beginning with Ray Stantz's exposition dump (""Egon Spengler can rot in hell""). I started getting really depressed, in the same way I got depressed when I first saw The Force Awakens. The realization that these characters I loved all these years ended up living shitty lives for the past 30 years. That all these friends were pretty much estranged from each other this whole time. It just really brought the mood down for me.

After treating the material so seriously in its first half, it made things like the mom turning into a terror dog seem so silly and out of place for this movie. Honestly, that's the way I felt about most of the second half, which was essentially a rehash of the Gozer plot from the first movie (why?). When the three legends finally turn up (which honestly didn't hit as hard as it should have), it feels like it could have been the start of its own movie. The post-credit scenes give us an indication of what that might have felt like. My main problem with this movie‚Äîand the reason it doesn't feel like a direct sequel to the franchise‚Äîis that it's just not *fun* like the first two were. A lot of that had to do with the wordplay between the characters and their fascination with the spectres themselves. Everyone in this movie did not react to supernatural phenomena the way real people should. There was also no sarcastic Bill Murray character giving us funny one-liners throughout. The kids were all fine on their own, but are they supposed to inherit the Ghostbusters business, or is Winston thinking of bringing back the old team? I just don't know where to stand at the end of this.

I think the biggest part of my disappointment is the fact that we had been waiting *so long* for a proper sequel to Ghostbusters. They went through so many original treatments and completed drafts and different incarnation over the years (which I had been tracking throughout). This doesn't feel like the Ghostbusters movie we've earned after all this time. Something is just lacking about the whole thing and I can't quite place it. It might be the fact that I'm tired of a ""new generation"" inhabiting these roles, when all we really want to see are all the old guys back. At the very least, it was a nice send-off to Harold Ramis (the CGI worked better than expected, but not at all like Harold looked in his final years). Had they made this movie while he was still around, it could have been so much better. Coulda, woulda, shoulda. *\*sigh\**

Most of all, I just feel old. Really fucking old.",qx6sxk

hl9i1id,"I don't know why people keep saying this movie was a rehash of the first. There were a TON of references to it, obviously,  but the plot was hardly the same, at least until the climax.

It was as different from the first as the second was. It had a totally different plot unlike, say, The Force Awakens vs A New Hope 

The 2016 film was too much like the first.  The difference between 16 and 21 was 16 tried to recreate the nuts and bolts of the 84 movie without leaning into nostalgia. If anything they actively tried to run from it. 

The 21 movie, however, loved the 84 movie and could not stop reminding you of it while it told its own story. That, I think, is one reason it's being given more of a pass with its shortcomings, vs the 16 film.

Anyway, I really liked it. It was funny, moving, occasionally scary on a juvenile level. 

The only thing that didn't sit right with me was the idea that Ray, always the most gung ho of the bunch, would not believe Egon about the return of Gozer, but at least the movie attempted to explain that away.

Grace was amazing though. She was perfect in every scene",qx6sxk

The granddaughter says that was ""20 years before I was born"" but shit you know science stuff, you know physics which was before 20 years before you were born. 

The Spenglers should've been world fucking famous by this point, even if there were no ghosts. I mean Fucking Muhammad Ali was still famous for being a boxer long after he stopped boxing. And people in culture remember him.

The movie just worked, sort of a Ghostbusters meets Stranger Things with right reverence for the source material.  It was a good hand off. Good horror storyline that makes sense in the Ghostbuster universe.

If I'm going to pick it apart (spoliers):

 >!1) the Shandor storyline was largely a dead end.  
2)  the humor just didn't really land, with the exception of the ""Pod Cast"" character.  The dialogue with Egon's grand daughter and Gozer, for example, was complete cringe.
3) some small plot holes just didn't make sense, like why did Egon show his grand daughter the trap that started this whole mess?  Like pulling a pin in a grenade
4)  I liked the original cast coming in, but talk about a forced entrance that felt shoe horned in.  Bill Murray seemed to just phone it in.  I felt they could have given a few more minutes of screen time to the reunion we've been waiting for 20 years.!<

hlc7oen,"I might be alone on a complete deserted island but I really thought the 3rd act fell flat on it‚Äôs face for me. I really thought McKenna Grace was great, loved her and sidekicks chemistry and banter. Paul Rudd & Carrie Coon are having a blast, and there‚Äôs a really sweet heart at it‚Äôs core. To me though, this tense buildup of this end of the world threat turning out to just be Gozer again and then just going out‚Ä¶so fucking easy again was just a head scratcher. There was nothing remotely interesting or different in that last act to make you feel any type of stakes or that it was an actual threat like the way it was set up. I would‚Äôve loved to see the town start to get possessed and taken over, just have a way larger than life villain that should‚Äôve stumped the original crew and needed more to it. It would‚Äôve been neater to have them almost fully integrated into that final act and Ray/Phoebe etc working together trying to figure out how to stop this threat with the help of Egon‚Äôs light ghost giving tips and nods. Ultimately just disappointed it turned into a quick and rushed rehash of the original movie and didn‚Äôt find better ways to reintroduce the original Ghostbusters - wish there was just more there to make it stand out above the rest with all these other nostalgia-filled reboots and remakes. The Harold Ramis moment was really sweet and it‚Äôs a perfect pay off - but it ended way too abruptly and almost everything else set up went nowhere, Finn Wolfhard‚Äôs character was almost useless? Like the love interest stuff had holes all through it too. Why in this world would the Ghostbusters have that kinda falling out and why would ghost hunting just stop being a thing, why would no one remember and take the shit seriously when they literally watch footage on YouTube of a giant marshmallow man walking through New York & 4 guys stopping the end of the world on top of a building?

hlffhrp,"I really wanted to like this movie, there were so many great aspects there (the original music, the practical effects, Egon‚Äôs granddughter, Paul Rudd), but sadly it‚Äôs held down by other not-so-great parts that I will attempt to list:

1. There was only like 1 ghost hunt in it, and it wasn‚Äôt even Slimer. The opening scene was really cool with the invisible (we know now Gozer) chasing the late Egon, but after that its a ghost free zone until I think they open the trap to quickly see one of the hell hounds for like a millisecond, then they face Muncher which was pretty cool and they even tied it later into the plot, but that‚Äôs it save for the boss battle, dogs, and Egon. I know a few ghost terrorized the town towards the end, but we never saw the team face any of them. Idk about you but I wanna see some ghosts get busted!
2. Too long, too many subplots. Opens great then takes forever to get rolling again. Def coulda cut more stuff out.
3. Too much reference to the first movie. It was all fine with me until they did the KeyMaster GateKeeper thing again, cause even on screen I felt like it was played for laughs anyways.
4. Barely even recognizes the second movie. Opposite of #3, they didn‚Äôt mention 2 at all! You‚Äôd think the freaking STATUE OF LIBERTY walking around Manhattan would be world history for all of time in that universe! How do they barely even know about the ghost busters? Felt very out of world.
5. Needed more Paul Rudd, more Janine, more OG busters!! And stop wasting Sigourney on little 2 minute end credit scenes.

The best part of the movie was when the surviving originals appeared on screen. That‚Äôs my opinion, and in my perfect Ghostbusters movie, the young crew early on would have tracked down the surviving Ray, Peter and Winston, and working together the old and new teams would solve how to stop Gozer, ending with force ghost Egon helping to save the day and the guys seeing their buddy one last time. Early-midway accidentally release some ghosts, have the big hunt on Muncher, then montage hunting the other 3-4 (including slimer lol).

at least the '16 version knew it wanted to be quirky and fun. '21 version is awkwardly in between serious and fun.

5 or 10 mins could have been taken out while maintaining everything the film set out to do.

overall, a resounding eh",qx6sxk
hn2fq8j,"Of all the movies I‚Äôve ever seen, this was one of them. I initially wanted to say this was a bad movie, but after reading other comments I think it was just boring from end to end. Very predictable plot, including the ending that you could see from 2 miles away. Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon‚Äôs behaviors while possessed were very weird, and not in the good way. The main character wasn‚Äôt too bad, they wanted to make it obvious it was supposed to be Ramis‚Äôs granddaughter, but it felt like they went too overboard on the appearance and neglected the acting skills.

I have Regal Pass so it‚Äôs not like I paid for tickets, and I see movies that I wouldn‚Äôt normally see, but geez this one was a struggle.",qx6sxk
hl830fc,A lot of the jokes were...cringe. Paul Rudd is the best part of the movie though,qx6sxk
hl87brp,"3/5

I liked it and it was fun but it suffers much like Force Awakens did by taking too much from the original movie. And there are just waaaaay too many winks and nods to fans of the original. Way too fucking many.

The big 3 returning felt forced and dare I say, maybe wasn't even needed (less an after-credits appearance or Ray's phonecall) but Ramis was amazing and all the care and effort they put iinto bringing him back really  really showed.

I enjoyed it for the nostalgia but think a more original story would've paid more dividends.",qx6sxk

hrm3moj,"Interesting this movie isn't getting the same kind of hate that TLJ got for ""ruining Luke Skywalker"". Why does this movie hate Egon so much? He abandons his family (which is never really explained when he had one, how old is Coon's character supposed to be?), betrays and steals from his friends, ruins their business, spends decades alone without making amends to said family and friends. Did he know the world was ending in 2021? He had plenty of time to fix all his problems. I understand Harold Ramis is dead in real life but there's no reason why it's Egon. Should have just made it Venkman since it's more believable he would do all that.

The movie is just kinda boring, which is worse than bad.

Post credit scene also makes no sense. Ray said the firehouse got turned into a Starbucks so why is it a firehouse at the end?",qx6sxk

hl7qjti,"Can I talk about how much I despised Charles Bramesco's attempted take-down review?

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/11/ghostbusters-afterlife-jason-reitman-paul-rudd-review

>""Every time another anti-spectral doohickey first appeared on screen, it was met with orgasmic roars of excitement from the audience.""

Look, I know it's just someone being a self-promoting jerk on the Internet - the act of one who is trained to throw themselves in the conversation through whatever inane way possible - but Bramesco's hatchet job reads as a stunning parody of Film Twitter narcissism and elitist snobbery.¬†

It should go without saying that anyone who embraces the poisoning quality of fan conversation to attack others is disgusting and doesn't deserve ""Ghostbusters"", let alone social media. What happened in 2016 can and must be called out. From Leslie Jones being bullied online to Birth.Movie.Death. writer Devin Faraci's creepy defense of the film (later, in the same year, Faraci was accused of sexual assault), it is pivotal to bring up all instances of bullying that surrounds this franchise.

That said, this review seems to be going beyond this.¬†

The former Birth.Movie.Death. contributor Bramesco just oozes pomposity out of every pore of his body as he displays no respect for the audience's intelligence whatsoever. He clearly just sat there with his skinny arms folded - furiously judging them - believing that they couldn't enjoy a film through the lenses of their own experiences and honed judgements.¬†

Being this willfully judgemental towards the audience doesn't make you better. It doesn't make you worse, but it doesn't make you better. As ludicrous as it is for grown adults to act like children over having to share their toys, it is just as silly to witness Film Twitter bros like Bramesco furious that kids don't play with the toys they SHOULD like.

Bramesco is emblematic of what's problematic with would-be elitist circles. He's so desperate to be a member of the cool kidz in-group that he loses all awareness of just how smarmy and unlikable he comes off as he reverts to petulant score-settling and ""sorry, not sorry"" spoiling.

Lawyer, professor and screenwriter Marty Kaplan brilliantly captured reviewers like Bramesco in 2014 and his words are worth remembering:

https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/126300/

>""Whether they acknowledge it or not, they're enmeshed in the politics of their times, their class and their tribes. Every review is a kind of advocacy -- for a canon, a hierarchy, a particular system of distinguishing genius from mediocrity, a ranking of pleasures from base to sublime ... They‚Äôre classy gossip, status markers, taste-mongering framed as analysis.¬† They‚Äôre also a bullsh*ter‚Äôs best friend.¬† In an age of information overload, they‚Äôre a way to cope; knowing-about may not be as good as knowing, but it‚Äôs arguably a step up from being clueless.""

For all of Bramesco's talking points about any ""disturbing sense of ownership"" over the franchise, there is seems to be an equal amount being exerted by the likes of Faraci and Bramesco. The latter twitches-and-screams-and-clutches-his-pearls as the attending crowd had THE GALL to enjoy films THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE, DAMMIT! Bramesco's talking points have nothing to do with the film itself than neurotically worrying about The Discourse and what his peers would think.¬†

In fact, Bramesco even tried to worm his way the centre of the 2016 film's pre-release debate, too.

https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/ghostbusters-trailer-most-disliked-youtube


>""But the real-life ramifications of the online backlash have yet to be seen. For one, the current count of 590,501 dislikes pales in comparison to the grand total of 29,553,420 views on the video, suggesting that the box-office returns won‚Äôt suffer too badly.""

Bramesco can't keep his story straight. In 2016, he was claiming that fanboys were irrelevant: now he's suggesting that the 2021 film is a sign of their all-encompassing victory.

Neither premise is true.¬†

Creepy fanboys like Max Landis - with their ""Mary Sue"" slogans - couldn't hurt the box office or toy sales of Rey for ""The Force Awakens"".

The 2016 ""Ghostbusters"", on the other hand, failed because it struggled to justify its existence to a casual audience and the 2021 film will live or die by the same yardstick.¬†

And what's a ""fan"" anyway?

The phrase seems like a catchall to attack (perceived and manufactured) cultural enemies.¬†

Is a fan someone who fixates on the minutiae of popular culture, who is steeped in a sub-culture, who expresses their concerns in a vocabulary shared by likeminded individuals and has a concrete set of prejudices that he or she wants to see validated in content?

Because (forgive me) but that kinda sounds like Bramesco and Faraci.¬†

They use the phrase (or ""fanboy"") as an indignant shield to counter - justifiable - criticisms of elitism and snobbery. And it's a phrase that can be used for anyone who disagrees with them or - chillingly - enjoyed a film that they weren't supposed to.¬†

Oh, the horror!

It's nauseating that pseudo-intellectual nitwits like Brameso embrace pop culture as a crutch for their delusional self-image.

Bramesco is just another painfully mediocre fanboy who likes to pass himself off as a sophisticated film-lover: big on exhaustively performative gestures and little on meaningful action. Suggesting that anyone who disagrees with his assertions is a ""fan"" is a way of justifying - and weaponising - his own pretentions against casual audiences.

This review is pop culture commentary at its most manufactured, tiresome and ham-fisted. Or, to quote another Ivan Reitman film, ""lighten up, Francis"" (oh, and apologies to the delicate sensibilities of Bramesco for PANDERING with a reference).",qx6sxk
hlb45ci,"Delightful, and heartfelt.  Really enjoyed it.  And yes, while this leaned heavily into the nostalgia‚Ä¶. it  never feels forced or like it‚Äôs a crutch.   

However, as a staunch defender of Ghostbusters 2‚Ä¶. I would have like at least a nod towards that film.  Like in that last shot as they‚Äôre driving into NYC we see Ecto 1 drive past a park in the middle of the city and the Statue of Liberty is still there at the former site of the museum from the climax.  Repaired, but no way in hell was New York of 1989 gonna try and move it back to Liberty Island, but instead dedicated a new ‚ÄúLiberty Park‚Äù in the middle of the city, where the statue has been for 32 years.

The music and effects and sounds were perfect.

The kids were great and not annoying like kid actors often are to me. The adults were great too. 

I hate to say it but it was the original cast that I had the biggest problem with. Their debut was just odd and anticlimactic. It all felt awkward.

I also feel like we didn‚Äôt need to see so much of Egon. His hands holding the proton pack was perfect. Cut to a hint of his face with the reactions of the other three ghostbusters and the mom and to me that would have been fine. The CG looked really good though. 

Still liked it. Solid 8/10.",qx6sxk

Not the greatest but it was really enjoyable.",qx6sxk
hl7qf7x,"This is entirely my thing but im a little conflicted about using Egon as a plot point, ive always found kinda iffy using somebody that passed away be prominent on a project/movie , or atleast at this level where you got his ghost, his death ,apparition and even a double as a main focus,  but at the same time i didnt feel like it was disingenuous or forced, and after thinking it for a bit it was probably the best outcome and way to make him tribute

Sure is hollywood , movies make money and all, the entertainment machine and the consumerism monster long ago stop caring about the dead, but at the same time, Ramis was very fond with the series and Reitman managed to give him a very touching tribute, i  thought the scene with the original tr√≠o was very sweet , they werent acting they looked legit heartbroken in the goodbye, especially Akryod

And as a whole, the movie was really fun, the characters were very charming imo, mainly the kids, i can totally understand if somebody found them annoying or hated them, but they all fit the role they were mirrowing from the original ghostbusters pretty well, especially Podcast and Phoebe, Paul Rudd was Paul Rudd and it also worked well, and the humour was very close to the originals, a lot of zingers and off camera comments that are just pretty fast and stupid , in a good way

Overall is a great take on modern Ghostbusters , probably the best possible outcome , and just a genuinely fun movie all around, if you liked the originals you will probably enjoy this one too, especially with all the callbacks and fanservice.",qx6sxk
hl8bxhr,"I expected lower than average but I really should have known better.  I love Up in the Air and Thank You for Smoking.  I had no idea the kid had it in him.

First off it‚Äôs a very successful sequel to Ghostbusters.  Hell it‚Äôs a remake.  Hell it‚Äôs a homage.  It‚Äôs just fun.

hm0282j,"Aw man, I thought this movie was SOOOO good, until about the last 20%.

I was seriously loving the build up, everything was running smoothly and then the last few minutes were surprisingly anticlimatic.  Im pretty sure that somewhere out there exists a directors cut with a few more things to flesh out the movie. I bet they were worried about runtime, but like, if you invest that much time in the beginning, just commit to taking the time to ending the movie properly.

Little things that I thought were missed opportunities, a little more backstory about the dude who built the town. JK simmons Im sure had more footage that ended up just being cut. If not, that‚Äôs a bit surprising tbh.

The kids didn‚Äôt put on the uniforms. It‚Äôs a smal detail but, man it would have been cool to show them putting the uniforms on. Again with my other points, Im sure that exists somewhere.

Would have liked to see a couple more ghosts terrorizing the town. But eh, whatever.

Venkman, Stantz, and Winston showing up just lacked a wow factor, cut to them just standing there, no shot of their packs or something, them walking up, Idk it felt leas epic than it should have been. We‚Äôve been waiting decades to see these guys again. It just felt like ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre here, anyway‚Äù

The scope of the last confrontation with Gozer just felt small. Im surprised with how much we‚Äôve improved with technology that they really didnt improve on the final confrontation from the original or even the second film, which is just so gratifying in every way IMO.

Also, I didn't like a single character in this. The granddaughter looked like Egon, but lacked his charm, wit, and humor. Her intentional lame jokes were lame. None of the characters were funny and ironically, the least funny character was the comic relief podcast sidekick kid. He was just annoying. The movie was pretty much about the 2 pre-teens. Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, and the girl he was crushing on were just there.",qx6sxk

Not sure why people are unhappy about this because while yes, it's very Force Awakens-y, it did something really well with Egon's granddaughter's journey to finding her place in the world.

I‚Äôm glad I took today off. It‚Äôs been rattling around in my head all morning. This is going to be a stream of consciousness‚Ä¶

What a great gift for those hardcore fans who have been there since the beginning. I loved it after watching last night but, having had time to reflect, I think I love it even more now. 

That final 10 minutes is just off the charts. The CGI was so well done and done so respectfully. That shot of Egon not only helping Phoebe hold the wand but also fighting alongside the boys. Just‚Ä¶.wow. That image is stuck in my head. Would love to get a print of that image one day. 

Everything else was great. It kept that dry, sardonic humor of the originals while also having some fun scares. That entire first half of the film was such a slow burn and really well done. I do feel like the second half felt a bit rushed but a Ghostbusters movie doesn‚Äôt need to be 2.5 hours. I‚Äôll take the slow burn first half over the rushed second half. The final 10 minutes more than make up for it, though.

I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of the exposition phone call with Ray as it just seemed like a ton of backstory all at once. Having had time to ruminate, I really like the story they told with the team. It was very sad but hey, that‚Äôs life. You realize as you get older that it‚Äôs just kind of the way life goes sometimes. Relationships falter and friendships fade away. Some reconcile and some hold grudges. That look on Ray‚Äôs face when he sees Egon at the end really got to me. You can see the decades of regret as he sees Egon one last time. Aykroyd absolutely killed it. Murray brought Venkman back as if he never left. His ‚Äúbravo‚Äù after Ray‚Äôs plea to Gozer had me laughing my ass off. Man, I missed those guys. Also really like what they did with Winston, especially for the franchise moving forward.

First time was when she was coming out of the bathroom to examine the chessboard for the 2nd or 3rd time. When one of the pieces started moving I think I heard someone say ""look at it like, woah, is this really happening"" and she changes her facial expression.

Second time was when they were in the Ecto chasing the muncher ghost down the street and she's sat in the gunner seat. She's taking aim at the ghost and I swear that I heard someone shout ""beep, beep, beep, beep!"" in one shot to simulate the sound of the gun ready to fire on set. This honestly got the biggest chuckle out of me from the film.

It definitely wasn't anyone in the audience saying random things. There was around 10 people in my showing, no kids and I'm in the UK which has pretty silent crowds aside from laughing of course. It really stood out to me in the sound mix.

The mini Marshmallow Men is a perfect example of soemthing that‚Äôs fun but unnecessary and it reeked of ‚Äúbaby Yoda‚Äù silliness that took me out of it. 


But great performances all around, and way more touching than I expected. It felt like there were scenes left on the cutting room floor that could have enriched the mythos or shed more light on how the town was dealing with the ghosts. But oh well.",qx6sxk
hl82bk3,"Overall, fun film.  A little bit too much Nostalgia mixed in for me, but i really dug in the CGI spenglor tribute.  It felt well done.

Stand outs was the little girl, Mckenna Grace.  She sold a lot of the movie, which i felt was closer to the original Ghostbusters.  I wish the movie focused more on her and her friend, with Paul Rudd, rather than have a few side plot scenes with her brother, who imo, was useless.   But oh well.

I thought it started well, and was overall well made, but the first 2/3 of the movie started to drag on a bit, and then the last 1/3 had to cover too much in a short amount of time so it felt rushed.  There were definitely parts I liked, but it‚Äôs not better than the original.  I‚Äôd be interested to see a sequel still.  I liked the cast.  This felt like a soft reboot, so hopefully they can branch out more next.",qx6sxk

I was able to turn my brain off for those mostly and enjoy the movie, but it would have helped if these weren‚Äôt 12 year olds I think.

I think it breathed life back into the franchise, especially after whatever the last attempt was, and it also, imo, seemed to basically be a tribute to Harold Ramis. The entire film was written with him in mind. This was nice.

As someone who was a kid when the original Ghostbusters was released, this was flush with nostalgia that brought back a lot of childhood memories. Especially the Commodore 64 Ghostbusters game I must have played a thousand times.

Anyway, a good movie. While I understand the criticism, I have to respectfully disagree. It was a pleasure going back and remembering, and seeing the original cast again. Sad Rick Moranis didn't have a small cameo though.",qx6sxk

Than you for making this movie.",qx6sxk
i5t7svr,"I honestly found this movie shallow and poorly written. 

The whole story spawns from the fact that Paul Rudd's character is a top-tier idiot who frees a ghost, even though he *clearly knew* what a ghost trap was and he also knew that something was probably inside. And to make things even more stupid, as soon as  he realizes what he has done, he's like  ""fuck it"" and proceeds to hit on Phoebe's mom. As if, the world almost didn't end because of him. Literally, the mcgaffin of this movie (i.e., the reason of why the story unfolds) is just Mr Grooberson's total dumbness.

On top of this, i found human reactions not believable, at all. In the universe of this movie, most teenagers don't know about the New York incident back in the 80s (which means that they don't know of any ghosts, since that was the only time ghosts appeared, as said in the movie), and most people have never seen a ghost in real life. And yet, when anyone finally sees the first ghost, they don't seem to be shaken. They're surprised at best. Take for instance the scene when Trevor ""sees"" the ghost from the well. He sees and hears something  that he clearly doesn't understand, which then flies away in the sky. Next scene we see Trevor, he is all happy while messing with his grandpa car. WTF. you just saw ""something"" you can't explain yelling and flying into the sky and you just keep going like nothing happened??? 

One last detail worth mentioning. Where the hell is the police during the ghost shitstorm???? During the scene when our young Ghostbusters need to get back their ghost gears from the police station, the police station itself is empty!!! Now, one can argue that all police went to help with the ghost mess, but for real? NOBODY was left behind to guard the station? Nobody?

The fan service wasn‚Äôt even bad, it was awesome. Especially the OGs showing up at the end along with Egon‚Äôs ghost. R.I.P. Harold Ramis. Soundtrack was good also.

There was actually a theory that Grooberson had been ""steered"" towards Summerville because he was a descendant of Shandor, and that the town would have been largely/completely overrun by Shandor cultists living their lives who see what's happening and basically kidnap/offer him up to Gozer.

Instead, the Terror-Dog just randomly spots him (where were all the other customers in the Wal-Mart?) and goes after him. 

And then you get the ghost cloud somehow tracking Callie down in Egon's lab... why? We know it tracked Egon back to the farm because he had something it wanted (Clortho spirit? Other Terror-Dog?), but how did it know to track Callie?

This film could easily benefit from an extended cut.",qx6sxk
hlcljlf,I feel like that creates plot problems. If the town were cronies they‚Äôd for sure be in and out of the temple and would prevent Spengler from setting traps. They‚Äôd probably out right burn his house down with him in it.,qx6sxk

hm1y2ky,"I read a theory that one extra reason Egon was shunned by the citizens of Summerville was that he talked ill of Shandor, who for them was the man who practically created the town.

I had the definite impression some subplot was left on the cutting floor. The sheriff disappears from the movie after the confiscation of the car and the equipment, and his daughter Lucky is seen becoming part of the core group almost suddendly. Also when the kids are discussing what to do next, I noticed one of the fast food guys (a Central Asian-looking dude) turning and looking towards them awkwardly, like he was listening, but nothing comes out of that.",qx6sxk
hlaihzs,"I think some of those leaks actually were the first place certain details came out. Like I want to say that the first time the name Grooberson was even known was in a 4chan leak that stated he was a Shandor relative.

Odds are, the film was reconfigured, reshot etc. substantially over the last couple of years. The Walmart scene had ‚Äúreshoot‚Äù written all over it, I‚Äôd be willing to bet money that less-entertaining Grooberson possession scene was scrapped and replaced because that scene was clearly designed to be a shot in the arm as the movie during a slow period in the movie.",qx6sxk
hlky7wo,"well it was said by podcast that all the miners and most involved with the mines itself had jumped into the pit either as a sacrafice or to await the destroyer to return them from the dead, it was even shown later that no-one was entombed other than Ivo himself. so there was no one of the cult left.  


If i had to guess based on what was said, the members of Shandor's investor and workers of the mine up and left when the mines ran Dry thus nearly killing the town itself. to the leftover townsfolk it was like a depression and they struggled ton keep the town relevant and able to maintain itself. (To the towns folk the Ivo Shandor company and the workers of the mine had simply left with the company, in reality they went into the mines and sacraficed themselves into the pit)  


I wish we would have had more moments that showcased egon's investigation and reasoning. Like maybe having Phoebe have dreams where she see's through Egon's eyes like showing Ray the Cuniform map of gozer's pyramid and Ray scoffing that he's chasing red herrings. This would lead Phoebe to relate to Grooberson more when she sees he's a seismologist and show him the map which peeks his interest and then her also trusting him with the Trap. Then later we could get the next dream of Phoebe seeing the Wall mural in the mountain and her taking podcast there on a feeling and finding the hidden chamber which surprises Podcast. This could connect her more with egon and his feeling of isolation and being alone in his research, feeling his pain of what he had to do despite letting go of everything that meant something to himself.",qx6sxk

I know I'll eat shit for this hot take but follow me;
We've seen countless times where Dan has given short takes about Ghostbusters and the like over the years while Bill (and Harold before his untimely passing) were mum about the future of the franchise. 

Ernie actively participating in Comic Conventions, his openness to his fans and that of the franchise and poking and prodding everyone in the franchise for one more romp was what he as the living soul and flag bearer for the team deserved. More of a central role and significantly more lines also. His true love for those he worked with us so genuine and real. 

Ernie is a goddamn treasure of a human being; kind hearted genuine, loving and generally present for his fans and the public in general.

Hearing him say ""I miss you friend"" drove me to tears because of a conversation we had in Niagara Falls in 2014. ""I owe my success to my drive and want to succeed. I owe my the love that I receive to him. *points at my Harold Ramis commemorative pin*. I can only hope that WE keep his love alive""

Reitman basically followed the Star Wars trilogy model (later arguably copied by the dark knight trilogy) which kind of leaves the second film as the outlier and the first and third films preoccupied by the same things to bookend it. In the case of Star Wars, it was vader, the dark side, and most noticably, the second death star; in the case of dark knight, it was ras, the league of shadows, and a bigger blow-up-gotham plot, and with ghostbusters, treating afterlife as the third of the trilogy, you have Gozer/Ivor, the cult of Gozer, and the 2021 event that was a big enough threat for egon to risk it all for but was also very similar to the original film's.",qx6sxk

It's funny hearing Americans talk about how bad their Walmarts are, when Canadian Walmarts are clean and well-lit. Essentially, a more ""upper class"" version of Walmart (think about how American Target compares to American Walmart).

Which is one of the many reasons why Canadian Target failed. American Target has slightly more expensive prices than American Walmart. But it works for them, because of how Americans see the difference in Walmart against Target.

Most Canadians live near the US border, so we're quite familiar with shopping at Target. But when Target Canada opened, they did too much, too fast. They opened like 130 locations right off the bat. And quite frankly, their supply chain just wasn't ready. 

What we wanted was an experience similar to American Target, so we could get merchandise with cheap prices (relative to the merchandise prices that already existed in Canada). What we got instead was a re-furbished Zellers (the discount chain that Target had bought all the locations of) with empty shelves (and the stuff that was actually on the shelves was vastly over-priced).

In the end, Canadian Walmart was clearly the superior option to Canadian Target (in terms of both pricing and selection for merchandise), so Canadians went back to shopping at Walmart, and Canadian Target went under.",qx6sxk

Then the town is shown to be a run-down, not super ""happening"" place so I buy that people wouldn't be populating it too much.  But the bite marks are harder to explain.  The ones early on when they're hunting Muncher aren't major but maybe the later ones were destroyed a bit by the proton pack?

Also, he‚Äôs a ghost that didn‚Äôt get sucked up like all the other ghosts? Huh?",qx6sxk

At no point dies he actually say he took all the proton packs, and I assume Ray held on to a lot of the stuff like flight suits and such for sentimental value.

In the '84 film, there's a guy wheeling it out of the lab as Dean Yeager is kicking them off campus. 

Podcast also picks up a Aura-Video Analyzer off one of the work benches. 

This wasn't JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens. 

This movie was made by someone who deeply, deeply cares about the original. 

The other thing that occurred to me walking out of the theater was the balance of nostalgia was perfect. Like, if I was 7 and saw this movie but hadn't seen the original, I would have loved this movie on its own, but I would have immediately sought out the original. 

And then I would have seen how all of his stuff started.",qx6sxk

hl7oidy,"I think the point was not that they just didn‚Äôt believe him. The implication was they‚Äôd followed his leads at the start without finding anything but he became obsessive to the point that it affected the rest of them and was destroying the business. This was at a time where he couldn‚Äôt prove what he believed.

Then while the Ghostbusters business was in big trouble and they needed to focus on it he basically robbed them and left them to implode.

I think the implication was by the time he found the evidence he was looking for he‚Äôd burnt the bridges and just came across as an obsessed guy who‚Äôd lost the plot. Ray says something like he phoned me 10 years ago, I wanted to believe him‚Ä¶ and then trails off. Can‚Äôt remember exactly, a lot of exposition in that scene, need a rewatch.

Ultimately his relationship with Ray in particular had to be irreparable damaged or the rest of the plot doesn‚Äôt work.",qx6sxk
hl8upph,I agreed they could have done more to make this convincing but on a second watch I noticed Ray literally says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt try(want) to believe him but...‚Äù literally right before he gets cut off during the phone call,qx6sxk
hlbrgst,"Egon was the smartest, so he could ascertain what the others couldn't. Ray at least told Phoebe he WANTED to believe Egon. So it wasn't just a surface level, shallow dismissal or invalidation of Egon, it came from as informed a place as it could have.   
 ...And yes, RHFilm, that rift between them was quite upsetting to me; not in a story logic way, but in the intended dramatic way. Hearing Ray say ""Egon Spengler can rot in Hell"" was like a knife. And seeing Ray get to apologize to Egon's spectre later was very cathartic after that.",qx6sxk
hlbhqz0,"there was a bit of exposition which said that their ghost hunting business was drying up as less and less ghosts were showing up. It's kind of like saying ""there is a flood coming"" while there is a drought.",qx6sxk
hl89vdp,That was honest to god my biggest gripe with the movie.,qx6sxk

hl8aq4w,"I feel there was a bunch of logic gaps in this and stuff you have to turn your brain off for.  I overall enjoyed the movie, but it is not a 10/10, and isn‚Äôt on the level of the original.  I would look forward to a sequel though.",qx6sxk
hlfsxkx,"Ray certainly. Venkman was ways in it for fame and women, Winston was just there for the paycheck. Ray would have believed him.",qx6sxk
hlgx84b,Peter and Winston not buying into it is fine.  Ray not going along with it is iffy. But as others said - what if they did believe him until a point. When things weren't panning out and they had to think about their own lives it makes sense they wouldn't continue along.,qx6sxk
hlii0b8,They didn‚Äôt ignore him though. It got to the point where his evidence wasn‚Äôt leading anywhere and Egon began focusing less and less on the business they were all running together and it began failing and Egon‚Äôs obsession made him a shell and probably very difficult to be around. From there it was like a band splitting over creative differences. Ray and Egon honestly gave me Paul and John vibes or something. Didn‚Äôt think it was a logic gap by any means- especially when we didn‚Äôt see how their relationships evolved over the 30 year gap.,qx6sxk
hmtk8pt,"It seemed weird to believe he couldn't possibly have explained to his friends using normal words what was happening. Nothing at the end seemed far-fetched given the universe they live in. Gozer wants to come back, here is a video of the ghosts coming out the weird tunnel.",qx6sxk

Even Ghostbusters 2 says they were treated like criminals after the events of Ghostbusters 1.",qx6sxk
hl8kp94,"I'm surprised people are so positive about this movie because this really put a damper on the whole thing for me.

100% agree. This movie was well-written, well-acted, adventurous fun. It's what I wanted Super 8 to be. It's the spiritual successor to The Goonies, in the form of Ghostbusters, and I loved every minute of it.

Ghosts are a negative energy. If we are energy then ghosts must be a negative energy right? They are the opposite of us. Electrons (negative) vs protons (positive). 

So ghosts are electrons (or negative type creatures) and ghostbusters use ""proton"" packs to counter their negative energy. 

Egon was a positive type ghost. His unfinished work was just to help other people out and not to take over the world or be glutenous (like slimer).",qx6sxk

hl7z5g9,"And tangled up within that is how we deal with loss and grief. 

When Phoebe yells at her mom about not telling her that her grandfather was Egon Spengler, it ripped me apart. 

Callie is dealing with the loss of a father who she felt abandoned her. She knew who he was and what he did, but she didn't understand it. Then he died. 

Phoebe is dealing with being an odd kid and not knowing her place in the world. Then she discovers she had a brilliant grandfather who she never had the chance to meet. 

Ray, Peter, and Winston are dealing with what they initially saw as betrayal by their friend, then they find out he was right, and now they have to deal with not supporting him and then him dying alone. If they'd all been with him, he'd likely still be alive.

And as an audience, we're dealing with the loss of a childhood film hero, and at the same time grieving for the loss of Harold Ramis the actor, writer, and director. 

It's a film about loss. Gozer just happens to show up.",qx6sxk

hlcaegm,Her mother is the mood slime sample Egon slept with in Ghostbusters II,qx6sxk

hl9dgcp,">If Egon didn‚Äôt have a kid with Janine, who the heck did he meet and have sex with? He wasn‚Äôt exactly the social type.

Well, Egon did save New York City on New Year's Eve '89 into '90 - he could've scored that night and ended up with a child.  That would've meant Carrie's character was about 30 in the film, and had her son at around 15 years old?

Egon's daughter being born basically immediately after GB2 is the only way it works.",qx6sxk
hlik07x,Just took it as a joking exaggeration of the neighborhood around the firehouse being completely different from back in his ‚Äúbusting days‚Äù Be a lot of repurposing to make that size  building a functional Starbucks in lower Manhattan,qx6sxk
hllrff2,"So, I thought about two as well. I think one of two things:

A) a portion of it became a Starbucks. It's a big place. Maybe there were rooms in the back that led to a back entrance and that was turned into a Starbucks?

B) it was just a sarcastic comment. Maybe Ray was just making a cynical comment on how companies treat places they move into with no respect for the buildings history, and or Ray being obviously old school as a NYC citizen, he probably doesn't appreciate Starbucks opening up everywhere, and probably dreads it happening to his bookstore too someday. 

The later is a bit of a stretch. In reality I think it was a plot hole left when Covid effected everything, but I think the movie deserves to have us think it's one of those two, and it's just never elaborated on.",qx6sxk

Fast forward 30 years and not one of the glossy foetuses starring in this thing have apparently seen, acknowledged the possibility of, or even sodding believe in ghosts but every last one of them simply shrugs them off with not so much as a raised eyebrow when they encounter them for the first time.

Just that this one felt like it actually had some respect for the source material... and ended up doing it right. If this movie were more like TFA I'm pretty sure Phoebe would've done just about everything in this movie by herself and the old gang would've died unceremoniously at the end.

> This movie showed how to properly do a Ghostbusters movie with a female lead

And it mostly did by *never* making a point about the lead being female. Phoebe was a relatable, understandable and... real character. Who just happened to be a girl. She didn't need to constantly remind everyone how she was a girl. She wasn't constantly being put down by just about every man around her for being a girl. She didn't need to make sex, boob and vagina jokes just to show us that 'girls can be funny too!'

In the originals one reason why I love them was because the characters felt REAL. They reacted to crazy situations like most people would, and these people were professionals when it came to the paranormal (for the most part). So when these tweens go down a mineshaft on a rickety elevator into who knows what without blinking an eye??? It reminds me of when they went into the sewers in NY and you could tell that even though they dealt with this shit, they were still having an emotional response to it.

Even the lesser GB films have jokes in them that make the audience laugh. This movie went a full hour before there was a laugh out loud moment for the audience. It also takes long time to get going - wayyyy too much setup and an embarrassing amount of exposition. They use a single phone call to explain 90% of why things are the way they are about halfway through the film, which just felt incredibly lazy.

When I was watching this, I was reminded a lot of the reasons the writers gave for keeping Luke's reveal until the very last scene in TFA. How he'd ""dominate the film"" or take the focus off the new people, and so forth. And then Hamill himself would wonder why he didn't show up right in the final battle, as it seemed to be setting itself up for that when he first read the script.

This film sort of goes in the exact opposite direction, but it works just fine. Who didn't want to see the original guys suit up again and show up during the main battle?

The film was good, but it didn‚Äôt feel like a Ghostbusters film. To me, Ghostbusters is a blue collar film set in the city. This felt like Stranger Things, mixed with Spielberg, with Ghostbusters elements thrown in. 

Picture this:

Ray, Peter, and Winston are living there everyday lives. They haven‚Äôt talked to Egon in years. They get a call from his estranged daughter that he died. They sorrowfully, but begrudgingly go to his old farm, meet his family (including Phoebe and Trevor, the former kind of introverted) and go through some of his things. 

As they are going through the belongings (with Peter making snarky comments like ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs where this was!‚Äù and Winston complaining about Ecto-1‚Äôs rusted condition, Ray discovers that Egon‚Äôs theory (the reason why they had a falling out) was right. 

The guys take Egon‚Äôs grandkids (with a soft spoken unsure of herself Phoebe helping solve a lot of the unanswered questions, showing her brilliance and gradually coming out of her shell) and start piecing the clues together, and chasing ghost all over town. 

The same beats could happen with Coon and Rudd turning into dogs, etc. with the kids still being kids once in a while, but make it about the fellas giving it one more go instead of some know it all 12 year old who can somehow steadily hold a proton pack even though it‚Äôs been shown to have the power of a firehose.

I'm now picturing your disappointment at the blank stares you'd get after asking a class of seventh graders who remembers that episode of Dallas from 1980. Also did you know the entire town of Tuscany Italy, including a packed soccer stadium and all sorts of news media witnessed a fleet of UFO's fly through and stop for minutes above the soccer stadium? [Happened in 1954](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29342407), was widely reported the world over and promptly relegated to historical footnote the world over, forgotten or disbelieved. That was real life, so yeah I can see the Manhattan Crossrip of 84' being similarly dismissed two generations later in GB Afterlife.  


>happens to know how all the electronics work, which do all work

GB Part 2 Egon mentions the gear has a power source with a half-life of 5000 years. Also if you ever owned a die cast metal Transformer or Voltron toy from the 80's you'll remember stuff was made to last back then. Worth note is that Phoebe's character proudly wears the genius kid trope on her sleeve. In some parallel universe her and River Phoenix's character from Explorers are talking aliens and ghosts in a lab somewhere. Plus electrical work is easier than it seems once you get the basics down and a real life kid ([Taylor Wilson](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/kid-builds-a-nuclear-reactor-in-his-room)) did build a nuclear reactor at age 14 so knowing about wires and fuses at 12 isn't too crazy.  


>suits for four pretty tall men fit a small girl, a small boy, and a kinda regular girl and boy,

After seeing the movie three times and purchasing the action figures I can tell you that the suits were all definitely oversized, rolled up where needed on sleeves and legs and held up by belts.  It doesn't come across that baggy on screen though so I can see your gripe but the kids were definitely swimming in those suits.  


>only guy in Walmart happens to be our guy, and is the only one to see the marshmallow dudes

We see other customers as he's walking in. Also other customers screaming and (presumably) running away is what first alerts him that something is wrong.

They went from catching one slimer tier ghost to fighting the final boss immediately.

As much as I don't like the 2016 movie it at least had some energy to it and had multiple ghost scenes.

The few minutes of screen time the original cast got was miles more witty and entertaining and fit the franchise than whatever the rest of the movie was trying to do.

hl8uvdg,"For the first 45 minutes or so I was thinking, ""Oh, this is cute; it's fun."" Then Dan Aykroyd showed up for his awkward ""Phone Call of Exposition"" and the movie really started to unravel for me. I was ok with references to the original (after all, it's set in the same 'universe') but they lost me when they insisted on (literally!) recreating every visual / plot point / reference from the '84 version. Towards the end I remember thinking that they should have just re-released the original and called it a day.

The writing/editing was also confusing for me. Janine shows up for 60 seconds in the beginning, and for the post-credit scene. And...that was it. What was the purpose of the mid-credit scene other than to shoe-horn in a cameo from Sigourney Weaver? The way the movie played felt almost as if they originally intended for the movie to have parallel storylines: one with Egon's family, and the other back in NYC with the original cast. We'd see Egon's family discovering what was going on with Gozer, while simultaneously checking in with the OGs in NYC. Maybe Ray was supposed to 'get the band back together' after his phone call with Phoebe, which leads to The Big Finale. Instead, they decided to cut all that, which made the storyline feel a bit odd.

This film had jokes too, some good lines I thought. Just the comedy was nowhere near as good and as memorable.

Maybe I‚Äôm also just target audience and enjoyed the nods and winks but given what I heard before going from some outlets I was expecting a lot lot worse.

Where on either side you have a crappy continuation of the series or a cheep knock off of the original. But if you do it right you get a proper send off to the old guard and start to the new. And got some reason I walked away from this movie really thinking that, while it had flaws in some minor ways, the story worked and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next era of busters. 

Obviously the Ramos tribute added some emotional free feel good points and that may be skewing my view.

A couple of scenes where some random town people get scared to death would have helped a lot.  There were so many missed moments like during the ""ghosts on the loose"" montage, or the Wallmart scene where nobody else in is the store?

The whole concept of the world rejecting the reality of ghosts after the first two movies is kinda crazy. It might be believable, but it needed to be explained better.

In the first movie, Gozer jumped across the door threshold, dematerialized, and presented the choice for giving it a destructor form for the earth dimension. That‚Äôs Gozer‚Äôs main thing! In this movie, Gozer seemed content to be in its alien woman form and, at first, seemed content to just chill in the mine (clearly our dimension) with the dogs until Phoebe ruined the vibe.

I‚Äôm not sure where the ‚ÄòGozer draws power from the dogs‚Äô came from either. Their purpose in the original was to open the dimensional door and then stand guard. Here they are a power source?

Also, having the Ghostbusters cross the streams immediately was also kind of crazy. In the original, it was a last resort to close the door (‚Äòreverse the particle flow through the gate‚Äô) with only a very slim chance of survival.

If a character dies in a franchise, they get honored in some way. Tony Stark did in Endgame. The story in the movie is honoring Egon, not Ramis.

hlt25bp,I was glad they didn't play the song until the very end. This movie was doing its own thing and I don't think that song would have fit anywhere without being jarring.,qx6sxk
hl9c4wu,"I watched the MovieBob review last night and he made an observation that feels really fitting to your comments.

The central conceit of the original movie is that you have all this super important stuff going on with sumerian death cults and bizarre architecture and the coming apocalypse and so on. And it's all defeated by four guys who are just pest exterminators with fancy equipment.

However, everything after that point has been all about the lore. The history of Gozer, the technology of the proton packs, etc. Which makes sense, because all that stuff is awesome. But the downside is that stuff like Afterlife takes stuff seriously that was meant to be inherently silly. Which is why stuff like the mom's possession feels so out of place.

Overall I did enjoy the movie, but I think a little tweaking here and there could have benefitted it.",qx6sxk

Egon was handled pretty well compared to a lot of recent movies trying to bring back deceased actors.",qx6sxk
hlkf2k6,"No Moranis. It has all the same returning castmembers from the 2016 movie, and they‚Äôre all barely more than cameos since everyone but Weaver appears in two scenes.

The nostalgia bait basically amounts do groanworthy callbacks like a character saying ‚Äúwho you gonna call?‚Äù and the Rudd character geeking out over props and said props being photographed in a hilarious, almost pornographic fashion. The film really focuses on props more than anything else. It presents you with things like a Crunch bar wrapper or a Twinkie or Venkman‚Äôs hotel maid door placard and expects you to cum in your pants over them, only to spend (no exaggeration) less than 5 minutes of screentime on the characters you grew up with. And the villain is just Gozer again. Oh, yeah, and they say the Ghostbusters didn‚Äôt actually beat Gozer in the original movie, they play it off like it was more of a draw and what they were actually doing was stopping a ghost army from coming to earth, which was never stated in the original and only serves the purpose of reusing Gozer again for memberberries. 

The Egon tribute is literally CGIing his face onto the warden from the Shawshank Redemption so he can help his granddaughter shoot Gozer and can give her a hug and give everyone the sads. The whole plot is that he abandoned his family and his friends to go live as a hermit, in the story they say it‚Äôs so he could wait for Gozer‚Äôs return but in reality it‚Äôs just so everyone can be mad at Egon and then forgive him when he appears as a force ghost.",qx6sxk

Sigourney Weaver is in the first end credits scene.

Sadly, no Rick Moranis.",qx6sxk
hm76o8n,"The OG cast isn't the main draw here. As a story, Egon's presence is felt strongly throughout this, and there are scenes using another actor to reenact him in shadow, aside from his ghost scene. This is more of a GB: The Next Generation film. It's not loaded with gratuitous references like some people try to claim. The kids discover the old equipment, but if anyone thought a GB sequel wouldn't have the equipment again, like GB2 did, they were crazy. The Gozer villain plot is sort of re-used, but condensed in time so the GBs can have a rematch. And of course the Mini-Pufts are a cute re-use of a famous character just as Slimer was re-used in GB2 for a new purpose. This is a story of kids discovering ghosts and ghostbusting history in small town America, quite different from the plot of the original.",qx6sxk

hl7qrkx,"It's all a bit rich for Bramesco to speak of fan toxicity, anyway. He's in no position to criticise anyone given his long-time association with the ugly Birth.Movie.Death. and Alamo Drafthouse crowd.

Here is a breakdown of the instances of abuse and cover-up that came to light about the disgusting brand before, during and after Bramesco's employment from 2018-2018.

- In 2016, it was announced that Devin Faraci would leave after a sexual assault allegation came to light. League reached out to the survivor, Caroline, and told her that he had removed Faraci from the company. Faraci claimed that he was an alcoholic and pulled the Kevin Spacey defence of claiming that he didn't remember the sexual assault but apologising anyway. This claim is unlikely given that Faraci joked about an eerily similar act of sexual assault in a review of the 2012 film ""The Impossible"": ""an agonizing experience for anyone who refuses to have their emotions shamelessly fumbled with, like a drunk crudely groping his partner on the dance floor.""

- In 2017, it was revealed League secretly rehired Faraci anyway ... or maybe Faraci never left. As Caroline put it, ‚Äúso, I was lied to and brought into what was essentially a PR scheme ... since I never asked for devin to be fired to begin with, or demanded an apology or boycott, I‚Äôm just EXASPERATED at how sloppy this is‚Äù. League apologised for letting women down and promised change.

- In 2017, Jasmine Baker said that Harry Knowles assaulted her on two separate occasions (in 1999 and 2000) and - when informed - The Alamo Drafthouse did nothing. My understanding is that she said something about it at the time and it was ignored, so she mentioned it again.¬†

- In 2018, a report from Splinter found that The Alamo Drafthouse had allegedly minimized sexual assault and harassment made towards both patrons and employees. So much for for promises of change.

- In 2020, a further expos√© (this time from The Pitch) alleged abuses perpetrated by both the management at the chain‚Äôs Kansas City locations and corporate brass across the business. These include sexual harassment, racist profiling of customers, unsafe (and often illegal) work environments and even financial irregularities involving ticket sales. ‚ÄúThe Pitch reports that despite promises from co-founder Tim League, who embarked on a listening tour of various locations in the wake of the 2017 allegations, little has changed within the company.‚Äù

And on it goes.¬†

It is laughable that the Bramescos of the world can keep their head down and ignore the abuses that surround them while pushing this line about the ""casual cowardice"" of others.

Pu-lease.

For all his affectations of superiority, he really is an insolent brat, and not a particularly clever one.

It's clear that his proclivity for moral posturing outshines any self-awareness (or talent) that he may possess. He'll likely continue to peddle pretentiousness and hold others in performative, sneering contempt all the while casually ignoring the ugly truth about his colleagues and employers.¬†

No one worth their salt in criticism or the film industry takes this humorless scold seriously or makes excuses for his pervasive hypocrisy. Bramesco (like Faraci) is beyond improvement and is too gratuitously cynical to be helped.

What is more disturbing is the issue of why The Guardian would choose to amplify ugly voices like Bramesco's and allow him to darken their readers' doors.

Sorry, but nobody should get off that easily.",qx6sxk

See, here's something that I think is more a recent complaint type of thing.  I saw a lot of snarky comments or tweets about ""there's a character named 'podcast' because....he has a podcast"" and people joking about it.

First off, in the movie they make it clear he's also a loner looking for a friend and admits that only he calls himself that (after being asked 'why do people call you podcast?').

But the main thing I dislike about these comments is I bet a bunch of the people making them would list The Goonies as a classic kid/family adventure film that is similar in tone to this flick and they would NEVER complain or point out that **THREE** of the main kids in the cast are named Chunk (the fat one), Mouth (the sarcastic talkative one), and Data (the smart/tech/gadget kid).

I mean, she is just a kid handling serious equipment and fighting demons, it‚Äôd make sense if she had some ghostly Egon help behind her (something like, she says early on, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know, this all feels oddly natural to me‚Äù and then the egon reveal at the end is like ‚Äúohhh, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going on this whole time‚Äù).

Not nearly as dangerous a situation, but I've given many talks as a grad student and was always very stressed, I would be very tired afterwards, I'd often even still feel it the next day.

I think showing him manifested helping guide the hand and then he himself being trapped in a trap would have been a better cut away than 5-10 minutes of silent acknowledgment. Maybe something about him being trapped and then released somewhere like you do with ashes.",qx6sxk

Same here. The thing is, as much as it looked like a great representation of Ramis/Egon not having him speak at all felt a bit odd. That doesn't mean I wanted them to force some lines with old dialogue or someone standing in for him.  It's just....when it was every original gets to say a thing, then the two grandkids get their moment, and finally the daughter gets her hug.....it was very good and I was tearing up for sure. But It did feel like it went long.  Like...I kind of would have been fine if after he helped Phoebe hold her position and after the OG busters got a glimpse of him he then faded away.  I didn't need the extra goodbyes (but that also doesn't mean I wasn't moved by them.....Ray saying he was sorry and Winston saying they should have called....it helped play into the loner Egon final story).",qx6sxk

I knew from the trailers that this was a Stranger Things/Super 8 style family adventure in the Ghosterbusters ""universe"". So my expectations were met.

Obviously he had proof when he found the temple and set up the wands in the shaft to keep the ghosts down, but by that point, it seems he just decided to take everything on himself.",qx6sxk

I didn't watch *They Live* the other night looking for things that weren't going to be in it, and I didn't watch this expecting it to be an award winner.

hll82dy,"also combine this with the change in the group dynamics, Previously Peter always held them together by being the con man that got them the money or support to continue. With Peter and Winston already gone Ray had to not only take the role of responsibility of finances but also the role of trying to keep a dying dream alive.  


Now imagine Ray and Egon working, far into debt that brings stress to the workplace, Egon who processes stress and emotions far differently and is oblivious to things like finances is continually bleeding more debt by pursuit of dead end research into a massive storm of PKE while in reality PKE was dropping and nearly no ghosts were around anymore. Couple that with what appears to be Egon disassociating with his daughter when infact we know Egon like Phoebe process emotions differently and may even be taking his stress of being a struggling parent and outwardly projecting a calm non empathic outlook for Ray or his daughter. Egon was worried about Ray, he was worried about his daughter, but for him he could only process these issues through a cold and calm exterior. Eventually the boiling point tipped from Ray's point of View, bleeding money and about to foreclose on everything Egon vanished and with him he stole everything from the GB HQ leaving Ray with outstanding debt and most likely finding a home for Egon's Daughter. From Egon's perspective he was protecting them both from what would be a long and drawn out investigation to prevent the next end of the world event, he couldn't bear to see Ray stress and emotionally burn out and he couldn't take his daughter and deprive her of growing up in a positive environment.",qx6sxk
hlcfttq,"I totally understand where you're coming from, and of course no one can tell you how to feel except you. At the same time, for whatever it's worth, Egon didn't process life like most of us do, which is what made him a pioneer science genius, and he was most engaged with life when pressing his brain up against dire adversity. He was like an astronaut who wouldn't think twice about going to space alone for 10 years. In the original movie, in his own studious way, he's on fire with passion in the jail scene while illuminating the psychic disturbance in Dana's high rise building, all but slightly grinning in a way we don't otherwise see as he explains it; and he's the one who ultimately says they could cross the streams to try to save the world. So his laying the groundwork in Oklahoma to help prevent the apocalypse was like his divine purpose; it's what he was born to do. He had an intellectual severity of perspective that transcended traditional concepts of sad, happy, life, death. And all the characters in AFTERLIFE get to have beautiful closure including Egon himself at the end. Understandably, we're all going to have different opinions about the movie, as is our right with a subjective pop art medium, and be that as it may, GHOSTBUSTERS has always been and is still about misfit underdogs who are derided, discredited, misunderstood, underestimated, and are ultimately vindicated and victorious in the end.",qx6sxk

They do have cell phones. I‚Äôve commented a few times that logic was not this movies main interest, but i get it‚Äôs a fun, for kids, popcorn movie.

Feel like it was someone in academia who maybe moved to further their career at a University of Chicago/Northwestern which may explain her in Chicago and coming from little financial means.

hll8eqx,"I'm not sure what you mean.  It's not a coming of age story at all, the whole film is over like 3 days and none of the characters really experience any growth, maybe the mother at most.  The reason I said it was like TFA was because in TFA you had a group of rebels lead by the protagonist and they had to blow up a big space station that was capable of blowing up planets.  Those are the same beats as A New Hope.  In Afterlife you have a group that have to stop a powerful ghost named Zuul that was released by the joining of the Gatekeeper and Keymaster.  They use proton packs, traps, etc.  Things go wrong and they have to use a little on the spot ingenuity to prevail.  That's the same plot beats as Ghostbusters.   


Neither TFA or Afterlife are carbon-copies of their genesis films, but they have a lot of similar beats. That's the point I was making.",qx6sxk
hlchy36,"Definitely agree about the end.  The last 20 minutes of that movie were pure magic.  I'm also really really glad that Egon didn't talk.  I feel weird about the whole using dead actors thing, but I feel like they did it really tastefully.",qx6sxk
hlcpcq4,Why? 2016 treated itself as separate from the original films.,qx6sxk
hle9d2i,Yeah it's possible callie could have been born between 1984 and 1989. Janine was really after Egon in 84 but might have moved on to Louis Tully in 89 because Egon was off the market or was spending a lot of his free time with his daughter.,qx6sxk
hle8vt2,Yeah I guess the teen Mom theory would work as she was projected as an irresponsible parent. That would also help the timeline a bit. That's a good theory. That also works as her being born after 1984. Janine was all about Egon in 84 but went for Louis Tully in 89 which means Egon might have been off the market.,qx6sxk

hl9vvgo,"I guess you could say that because this is a ""post ghostbusters"" world that maybe once the fact is known among the kids they accept it as reality pretty quick considering all the adults were jaded to the idea already. It would have been cool to see more of the effects something like that happening 40 years ago would have on culture or pop culture. 

This seemed more like a world that is exactly like ours except for that tiny incident that happened in the 80s and is sometimes referenced but overall forgotten. In reality, that would have been a 9/11 size paranormal reckoning. There would probably be lots of cults and religions sprouting up and a lot more people way obsessed with ghosts than one seismologist who treats a full ghost trap like a Star Wars toy.

But then again, Carrie Coon was already in The Leftovers so we can't just retread all that in her movie. But I definitely agree that the balance between making this world and its history feel real was way off.",qx6sxk
hl8nqew,"I think it just might reflect how cynical modern civilization has become that no one seems to take anything seriously anymore. During that whole Wal-Mart scene with Paul Rudd, it seemed like sentient marshmallows were an everyday common occurrence. Also, was there nobody else working there or anything? Maybe it was just a slow night.

We can explain away Phoebe as being some type of autistic reaction, but when Podcast first sees the Muncher ghost, he also doesn't react accordingly. And then with Carrie Coon exploring her father's belongings, there is obviously the ghostly presence of her father leading her on, but she has zero reaction. And then the kids approaching the Terror Dogs and the earthly incarnation of Gozer seemed rather muted. It was a constant distraction, to be honest.",qx6sxk
hllbt6s,"I agree that the reactions were weirdly unbothered but I think this movie still nailed the ‚Äúcharacters feel like real people‚Äù angle. I was really in love with the way people talked to each other and even little background things like the kids reacting to mom and teacher clumsily flirting, or when they were going over their crazy plan in the diner people at an adjacent table just start turning around and eaves dropping.

She doesn't come off as a Bumbling Parent, she just comes off like a shitty person. *Especially* on the date with Rudd, the guy was expressing joy and excitement about something he loved and she sandbags him immediately instead of even pretending to be interested. And her ""don't be yourself"" comment to Pheobe, while I know it was intended to be a joke, just reeked of the kind of passive-aggressive shit I'd hear all the time that was meant as a joke to *them* but a barb to me. If felt mean, and would have probably landed better had their been a little more double-sided teasing between Callie and Pheobe to say that this is their dynamic and the kid is amused by it.

I loved the movie a lot, but the mom was really offputting to me.",qx6sxk
hl8plf7,"Didn‚Äôt she even tell Phoebe to ‚Äúnot be yourself‚Äù when discussing making friends at school, too? Like what kind of parent says something like that?

hl910ij,"I almost get why she was his opposite, Moranis and Weaver also had absolutely nothing in common as the Gatekeeper and Key Master, but the story was making it explicitly clear that they were going to be love interests (as opposed to Dana being completely out of Tullys league and there being no shot of Tullys crush being reciprocated), it did a terrible job of showing why Gruberson would want to have anything to do with the mom (aside from her being in his general age range, new to town, and somewhat attractive, her personality was toxic and repulsive). It seemed like they only put them together to have Gruberson be a father figure to Phoebe. IRL, if a man is that polar opposite to a woman, and is having his explicitly stated life interests be shit on throughout a first date, only to continue pursuing while showing interest in a teenage daughter, a good mom should shut that down immediately. The son and his girlfriend should have been aged up and turned into the gatekeeper/key master dynamic or some sort of inversion on that (like in the original where it wasnt the main protagonist but a nerdy neighbor).",qx6sxk

hnfi1x9,"Alright, I'll bite :)

So the first counter-move. She's at a new place, and knows her brother doesn't play chess, nor her mother, and someone has moved the chess piece. For a girl of science - hell, for anyone - is it more likely someone has entered the house / might be hiding there, or a ghost? I would expect she'd run to mom directly and warn her that someone is either hiding in the house or came in and looked around some. I mean, seriously? ""Wow, that's interesting - probably just someone hiding in the house - hope I don't get murdered or raped... but let's play this one out some...""

And the fire pole, where to start? Ok - what is the first thing YOU'D do (or anyone), if you're at a new place? You'd look around, check out all the buildings? Like that one right across from the main house? So how the hell was that even unknown? Check the garage, but not that building?

Ok, but it is unknown, and now you're following a device that beeps in a certain direction. Cool - wouldn't you still look around? Use the flashlight? Maybe look down a hole with a pole, before just blindly going down? (And really - a pole? Original made sense - they were in a fire house - but here? I mean, why would there be a pole there? Egon missed the good 'ol days? And how the hell is she expecting to get back up?) (And I know, it's an easter egg for us fans, but you could easily make them logical connections - again, too expensive for a good writer?)

Problem w/ '84 was there was footage, damage - remember, they were sued so much they had to go out of business - and then five years later was GB2 and the NY situation. Statue of Liberty taking the tour? I'm pretty sure that's enough to keep scientists and academia busy for centuries. Not to mention the general effect that would likely have on religions across the world. Again, good writing could have filled something in that made sense. Ok, I'm going to stop saying what good writing could have done, sorry :)

So the gear. I'm cool w/ giving some leeway, but I mean about everything in general. And the gear, but a car that's been out of commission for a long time, needs to be fixed, and can suddenly crash across corn fields, do some jumps, some serious drifting, and the tires are still shiny after that? Maybe toss some new tires on and THEN go mudding?

But I didn't go in too deeply, because I liked the film, even though it had massive plot holes but the one that REALLY bothered me...

Ok, so there's this mine that the ghost god is starting to take house in, and Egon fixes up some particle throwers to keep them ghosts down.

1. How the fuck did one man set that up? Or, how did he kill all the 20 or so people that you'd need to set that up, so they wouldn't tell anyone?
2. Why not tell anyone? Here's an end-of-the-world situation, that nobody believes you about, but now you have proof? And.... nothing. WTF?
3. Ok, you have proof, but decided for some reason to not show others, and somehow have this defense system set up, at the place.... where neighborhood kids show up every now and again to party and chill out at. And they're not that quiet about it - they bring their jeeps and trucks up to the top, swing on the mine tunnel elevator platform thing. And Egon was just like ""Ehhh - this is fine.""

I could go into sooo many more things - but ehh, Merry Christmas :)",qx6sxk

It's not even really a comedy about hunting ghosts, it's a comedy about a bunch of schmucks hunting ghosts because it's the easiest way they could think of to scam people and the government out of some money.

It makes no sense and there isn't really a way they could ever explain it to make it make sense to me (honestly it was such an easy fix too like just make it the Green saber).

On the other hand you have this movie with things like the PKE meter. Phoebe finds the PKE meter that Egon used in the original movies, because it was Egon's house. It makes sense why it was there and how she would find it.",qx6sxk

Also, this is a bit of nitpicking, but how did Trevor see the Ectomobile with the Ghostbusters logo on the side and not put two and two together?

It's just all a mess to me, but I guess most people just wanted to see the original guys back (for like 5 minutes) and proton packs and traps. While I liked all of that stuff as a kid, the movie was ALWAYS about the entire package of dry comedy, sci-fi , and a well rounded, fun story. It all worked and felt natural. I can't say the same for this movie, but I'm realizing most fans probably don't care.",qx6sxk

Usually sequels/reboots try to ""top"" themselves by doing more, but instead we got basically the same setup with Gozer and the terror dogs and all four proton blasts are what ultimately defeat it. We don't even get a 100-ft Marshmallow Man (or equivalent) this time around. It just feels very disappointing in terms of scope and all the places they could have possibly taken the story. No new lore is introduced (Ghostbusters II is always criticized, but at least it brought something different); it's just a retreat of what we've already seen and known. I guess if you frame the entire film as a tribute to Harold/Egon, the small, intimate details fit the narrative. But it still feels very lackluster when compared to the original.

hmbkpf2,"The fact that this exists at all is kind of disrespectful to Ramis. He was the only one keeping Ghostbusters 3 from being made, because he wanted to make it the kind of successor he wants, if he was going to make it at all. He wanted a sequel that'd live up to the first two, but right after he died, they just went ahead and shat out a crappy third movie. Then they shat out a crappy third movie AGAIN.

So then they spent this whole movie basically making Egon a really terrible character. One who neglected his friends and family and failed to even provide them with a good home after they went in debt. But not before the movie literally kills him, of course. Egon is killed at the start, and of course his original writer and actor had no say in it because he's dead so it's just a freebie. If they had just implied that he died between movies, that'd be fine. But no, they just killed off his character in a really tasteless way in a completely unnecessary scene.

But the part that made me most uncomfortable was his ghost. I'm completely against this practice of using dead people's likenesses for CGI to shoehorn them into the story exclusively for the reaction of ""Hey it's that guy I remember!"" The same thing happened when they brought Peter Cushing back to life for Star Wars Rogue One, and it was just as ugly and unnecessary then. If this character MUST be brought back for the story, then recast him. Don't bastardize them by turning them into a character that they can't consent to in a movie that they did not want to make. This kind of thing was charming when Fast & Furious did it because it felt like a farewell to the actor and the character, and they kept it really brief and didn't drag it out or insert Paul Walker into some badass shot with everyone because he couldn't arrive that day. The sentimentality of these people that didn't know Harold Ramis pretending like he loves them and they love him felt so disrespectful, on top of them using his likeness against his will. It was so tasteless and disrespectful, and I cringed every time he was on screen.

Let the dead rest in peace. Harold Ramis wasn't a caricature and Egon Spengler isn't some legendary figure in the Ghostbusters universes. They did it the way they did because Ramis is dead, and they wanted to use the image of him to invoke nostalgia, just like the rest of the movie used everything else. It's just so dumb and I can't feel like this is even remotely respectful to Ramis at all. He didn't want to make this movie, but they shoehorned him in anyways because now he isn't here to say no, and we're supposed to think it's meant to honor him because his appearance resembles a toy more than it resembles a man.",qx6sxk

Although yes, I‚Äôm fully aware there are cameras outside of all the key locations when the Ghostbusters were doing their thing, the idea that that shit wasn‚Äôt digitalized is something I can believe.",qx6sxk
hls14f6,"I mean... we were also supposed to believe that NOT ONE PERSON remembered the Jedi... \*eyeroll\*

  
This movie is told from the point of view of the kids. They WOULDNT know. I'm (proudly) dating a girl that is 20 years my junior and its a constant thing where we are talking and I make a reference to something that happened when I was her age and she is shocked she didn't know about it. The news cycle has a short memory and so does Hollywood. There are kids these days that don't understand how big of a deal 9/11 is/was. They know it was an event but dont know how to connect the trauma of that event to the event itself. They were not alive/old enough to understand that.   


This is how I let that part go.",qx6sxk

hlkdus6,Wasn‚Äôt the press already there because of the dome? And besides the statue walked for more than a few blocks and eventually had to be moved back,qx6sxk
hlbxscg,"My interpretation of it is that it‚Äôs a sequel to GB1 that ignores all other sequels. It‚Äôs implausible that the characters would have so many conversations about what happened in NY in the 1980s and not reference the events of GB2. Plus they made it sound like the GBs busted ghosts for a while after GB1 then fizzled out, which isn‚Äôt consistent with a universe in which GB2 occurred. It just so happens Ray owns an occult book store in this continuity too.

I _like_ the scene, but it soured the movie a touch for me because it left me with the feeling like...this is the last time we'll ever see these four characters together again and damnit this should have happened in the early 2000s.

She said that when Podcast questioned her about not being grossed out by Gary trying to bang her mom haha.",qx6sxk

hlkj7pm,The only time I saw her show any emotion is at the end. She cries.,qx6sxk
hlo0duc,That‚Äôs also a callback to Egon calmly saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.‚Äù,qx6sxk
hlc7gle,"Hah, yea exactly.  I guess the thing I‚Äôm realizing is this movie was made more for kids, so it appeals to them to see kids doing the cool stuff.  I don‚Äôt think the first Ghostbusters was initially targetted to be a kids movie, though kids turn to loving it.  For this one you kind of have to turn your logic brain off a lot of times to enjoy it.",qx6sxk

hlcagtt,":) Yes, totally.

hlazq7o,a bit of a meta reason but the movie is set in 2021. So...kinda understandable with all the shite over the past 2 years,qx6sxk

Half of you will realize being snobby costs too much about five seconds after you graduate college. You will buy anything that doesn't really matter at Wal-mart, and that is a lot of things.

hlln188,"I felt like there were a few things that could have been done a little better but I really enjoyed it. For this scene, in particular, I would have had Egon help Phoebe, get acknowledged by his friends, and then he should‚Äôve looked over at his daughter and nodded to give her the signal to open the traps where he gets sucked in with all the other ghosts/spirits. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense that he didn‚Äôt get sucked in and it would have made the send off more meaningful while cutting its length down a bit. If they wanted to keep in the ‚ÄúFor Harold‚Äù bit, they could have all opened his trap to let him go to the stars after Gozer was defeated without having to linger too long on the sentimental stuff.

Another one would have been swapping the roles of the Gatekeeper and Keymaster since it would have made more sense for Gozer to try and go after the daughter of the guy keeping her trapped first. It also would have given Paul Rudd the opportunity to play the ‚Äúsexy‚Äù persona that Dana played and give the movie another more comedic beat. Paul Rudd feels like an actor who could pull that off without going too far over the top.",qx6sxk
hlnzdjp,She got to burst out of the door with a proton pack and using it. A minor consolation.,qx6sxk

Suggests to me there was a bigger story (probably along the lines of Akroyd writing a 5 hour movie that had to be cut down and made understandable) and i got the sense that he had been around a lot longer than 150 years, sort of like Apocalypse.",qx6sxk
hlh138o,I like it as is. Shandor had built this mythology around himself and thought himself so important. Then Gozer just shredded him like he was nothing. Gozer is not human and cares nothing for human loyalty or concerns.,qx6sxk
hlh9bh2,"I did feel like a lot of this movie made it on the cutting room floor, there were a lot of gaps where I felt like movie was supposed to happen",qx6sxk

hmo1dii,"The additional ""lore"" had me so pumped up. Ancient map written in Sumerian of a modern American town? Give me more!",qx6sxk

hlhtx6p,"The original idea for Ghost Busters 3 was for that old cult guy Ivo Shandor, to be the main villian, who was the one that caused all the ghosts by summoning Gozer. 

Because they were never able to make 3, they use this idea for the basis of the ghost busters video game. It was essentially the best they could do with the ideas for 3 and went all out and had the entire original case voice it.

Now with 4, they wanted to to flesh out the idea, but i guess they didnt have much time and basically just glanced through it with 10 seconds of dialog. I think at this point its so cliche and worn out, its best to just let it go.",qx6sxk
hm9xqvb,Definitely that plot line was substantially cut down,qx6sxk
hnkfrvp,"Probably ""town cult"" subplot, because I don't think Spengler would've brought  Shandor to the pit",qx6sxk

hs686os,It's bizarre they left any of it in. Because I found it jarring for him to suddenly show up and then exit so quickly. I wish it had just been removed. Wouldn't have changed anything. Maybe the actor was contracted to appear for a minimum amount of time and they couldn't cut it?,qx6sxk

hlg955z,"I was blown away with how great the music was, and how it felt like it was dropped right out of the 80's/90's.  So many scores today are just featureless walls of sound and booms, so it was refreshing to hear something with personality, and actual orchestration.  I hadn't heard of him before this movie, but the composer is Rob Simonsen.  I was half expecting it to be Silvestri, James Newton Howard, or even maybe Danny Eflman.  I'm glad there are at least some younger composers out there keeping real scores alive and actually making music that sounds like something.",qx6sxk

hlav672,"Well, he has seen some shit that will turn you white.",qx6sxk
hlo2318,Well Winston after they first got locked up tried using the excuse he just worked for those guys and wasn't a part of them really. After he learned of the end of the world did he turn back around to being loyal,qx6sxk
hl9dchz,"She was one character too many, especially as they were bringing in the big guns at the end.

hlgcaof,"I think her snark was to toss in a bit of ambiguity as to who the grandfather was. Maybe Venkman, maybe Egon.",qx6sxk

hld4rcf,Ray had a dream about a ghost giving him a blow job. There was a bunch of sex jokes. The only reason it's PG because at the time of release the next existing rating was R. MPAA introduced PG 13 rating a month after Ghostbusters release.,qx6sxk

hlb1ws6,Remember also that Shandor said in the game that Gozer was a failure and that he couldn't understand why Gozer was called the destroyer. It works if you imagine that Gozer heard that and wanted to punish Shandor for insulting Gozer but also for taking the power for himself.,qx6sxk

Ray had said that when the business dried up Peter and Winston had already left and pursued their own new careers.

Combine this frustration of finances and Egon struggling to prove to his friend that they need to spend more resources and time on a dead end prophecy of the end of the world Egon found on a Old Cuneiform Map. Egon had seen how frustrated and stressed his friend was and also knew he couldn't take his daughter with him as he would be condemning her to debt and possibly a wild goose chase. So Egon made a decision to go alone and stole all the GB tech leaving Ray with nothing to continue with, seeing as Egon was the only one that could create the tech itself.   


As for the part with everyone getting back together, Ray knew about summerville, he stated egon had called him 10 years prior (the same time the earthquakes started) and he didn't want to hear anything about summerville or the Egon again.

As for the memory of the Manhattan 84/89 events, who's to say there weren't some black budget government studies or academic inquiries? Also the Catholic Church did send a representative to NY during the hubbub in the orginal films so there was definitely religious impact. However Afterlife wasn't so much about the greater GB universe. Its a small story about a family finding it's legacy in a creepy old farm house. I too would like some of these world building holes to be filled though so can't totally knock the gripe. But going back to the time thing, actually fleshing out these extraneous details would have added like a lot of run tume to the film, by the time all the bases were covered it'd be a 3-4 hour film.

One glaring point I'll give you is Egon not showing anyone anything once he clearly had proof of Gozerian hijinks. Even one cell phone video to Ray of the hell hole being blown back would have erased this whole film. Also why didn't any of these kids (especially the one who's entire identity is a podcast and who carries recording gear at all times) not film any of their encounters? All mom's money problems would be solved, the cops would believe them and probably would have called in Ray, Peter and Winston themselves. Only thing Podcast filmed all movie was a polaroid of burning trash. So the movie is definitely not air tight, just wanted to correct some things you didn't seem to notice in your first post there.

I like the film overall, but the more I think about this film, the more annoyed I get with the missing character beats, explanations and other info, the more I think that large chunks of the film were lopped off in the editing room. Is there going to be an extended cut?

Why/how did Phoebe not notice the giant board of pictures of her mother in Egon's lab? Why did the team leave a *loaded* containment unit underneath the firehouse (and was it *actually* turned into a Starbucks? Did no one discover it)? How is it that Callie apparently can't find work, but the moment they get to Summerville, her son's able to find employment without a problem (is it the alcohol addiction)? Neither Winston nor Peter ever bothered to take a trek out to Summerville to see what the hell Egon was talking about? What about the payoff of Lucky's father and the other cop mocking the kids then disappearing *completely* from the film afterwards? For that matter, where are most of the townspeople?

I'm the same age as Jason Reitman, and I remember seeing the original Ghostbusters in the theater four times. 

1984 is the same year The Terminator, Romancing the Stone, Dune, The Karate Kid, The Last Starfighter, Conan, and the Temple of Doom came out. 

The theaters were littered with larger than life, manly heroes who more often than not resolved the plot because they were physically stronger than everyone else. 

Ghostbusters is the first time I saw ""heroes"" on screen that made me think ""I could be that guy."" 

They were lazy nerds. Venkman is using his academic position as a way to score chicks. Hell, his first reaction to starting the business is to get ""rich beyond our wildest dreams"" by franchising it out. Ray likes working at the university because they gave them money and facilities and they didn't have to produce anything.

But when push comes to shove, they showed that prehistoric bitch how they do things downtown. They won. And not because of how strong they were, but because at literally the last moment, Egon figures out a way they can win not with muscles, but by out-sciencing the the nimble little minx with the flat-top.

So yeah, that movie meant a whole lot to some of us. Peter Venkman and Bill Murray's personality showed a ton of us that we didn't have to be Stallone or Douglas or Schwarzenegger to be cool. And it didn't hurt that it's beautifully shot.",qx6sxk

There's loads of scenes in that movie where a funny joke is delivered, but it doesn't get time to breathe because another cast member tries to riff off of it and extends the scene too long. They never gave each other's quips time to land. It meanders because it feels like they turned on the cameras and told the SNL actors to ""do the funny stuff"" without having a solid script. That movie pisses me off so much because it could have been so much better with a better script and a better director.

The callbacks are not that blatant for 99.9% of the film, and the vast majority of them are not simply there for the sake of being there.  They also go out of their way to add something new and fresh to all the returning elements.  

Much deeper lore with Gozer. Much more information about how Gozer and the Terror dogs operate as a sort of Tri-Entity feeding off and powering one another.  The new gadgets and modifications to ecto1 we've never seen before.  Even the ghosts workd itself is dramatically changed with the first on screen evidence of in universe crossing over of a ghost into the afterlife.  The movie is pumped full of new material.  

I also just don't understand why Gozer returning is inherently bad. I saw it as comic book logic.

Look at the old Ghostbusters, they aren't masterpieces either - the first one is the best, because of the unique concept and style of humor (and the effects it achieved at the time), but really, it has it flaws too - end of the day, these to me, are high entertainment films, not emotionally or deeply themed films lol.

After he died the script was written and re-written dozens of times until Dan Akroyd (one of the original writers) and Bill Murray liked it enough to sign on. 

I personally didn't like the movie because I'm a die hard fan of the original and I don't want to see the next generation of Ghostbusters, I want to see the original crew. But I can see why young people who are new to the show would like it. 

I did like the way Egon was written into the script and I did enjoy seeing him help fight at the end and help his friends win the battle that he'd been fighting alone the past couple of decades. 

I did notice and haven't seen anyone else comment on how Ray and Winston both spoke to Egon's ghost but Venkman didn't (wondering if that has to do with Murray's long time feud with Ramis the last 20 years of his life?).

And you keep referring to the fact that they made him a bad character, because he was a recluse and people thought he was weird. That's the entire point. They made it seem that way then revealed that he was actually working tirelessly by himself to keep the planet safe from.... whatever the evil thing was at the end. So it.

The premise was that the dates were times Gozer tried to come back and caused bad things to happen.  1908 was a volcano eruption.  1945 was ""a lot of things"" probably referring to the atomic bombings of Japan or maybe just WWII stuff in general.    1984 was the date of the first Ghostbusters events.  Then 2021 was supposedly this one, as if prophesized, however the premise seemed to be that Egon was actively containing Gozer for several decades...so was he updating that final year after every successful defense?",qx6sxk

Apart from a few select people, how many people knew that Gozer returned in the second mission. Some may have thought it was just another ghost taking a familiar form. Weren't there only talks of franchising and that it was coming soon? We could say that because Gozer was defeated twice now and Shandor was defeated, ghosts were afraid of showing up due to the Ghostbusters being so deadly. Boom, the talks of franchising now falls through because of no business even across multiple areas. Shandor could still be ""devoted"" because he wanted another taste of power when he only got a glimps of it previously. Also, the skull of Ivo Shandor can still be explained too. When the family get to the house for the first time, Phoebe picks up a bear statue. This looks identical to the one that can be collected in the Shandor island level. This can mean that Egon took many of the collectables with him, including the skull. It could've disappeared one day and went back to Ivo himself. !<",qx6sxk

More or less, Bill was saying, 'Why would someone want to watch this new movie when they can always watch the old one?'.

Like the New Robo cop or the New Total Recall - making those movies defied logic - the originals are classics that stand the test of time remarkebly well.

I showed my 10 year old Ghostbusters and she got hooked.  30 year old movie be damned.

It's a pretty common movie trope that when someone is doing something epic on their own, they tend to shut out everyone. Yeah, he could've called her, but more than likely that would've led to her wanting to see him, which would put her in danger. He was on a suicide mission and he knew it. That's why when the giant trap didn't work, he knew he was dead and he sat in his chair and waited for death to arrive. He knew there was no escaping at that point. It sucks, but he did the best thing for his daughter and in the end, she knew that, which is why she hugged him. I felt it was completely earned.

Maybe nostalgia salved a lot of the burns, but I still thought the first 15 minutes were amazing - plot, tempo, character-building - and again, overall, regardless of the points I mentioned, I had fun :)

To your points though, first the moved chess piece and PKE were at different times - so in reality, almost anyone would have clued family in right away about a possible intruder. BUT if they added a puff of smoke, a hint of cloud around the move/piece... then maybe not. Wait, it couldn't be.... ghosts?

And that's my view across the entirety, and where I think you're not exactly right on the needed time to make a good movie. You can easily change lines, add extra motions during other scenes, and have a great, coherent movie, with the same run-time as this. Trust me - the run-time didn't force the flaws - it was all predicated on the writing and directing.

‚ÄúThe original didn‚Äôt tell us much and nor does this!‚Äù

Not really a win for either films there, but whatever.

‚ÄúIs it going to be an all time classic? Uhhhh‚Ä¶the kids will decide.‚Äù

That‚Äôs a big fat no then. When one film basically has another film as homework to make it fully enjoyable then I wouldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs enough meat on the bones to make it a classic for a generation of people if they need to also watch a film their parents did as children.

‚ÄúI left the theater happy because it reminded me of memories of a different film.‚Äù

So they weaponized and sold you nostalgia and you get to attribute happy feelings that a different movie gave you to a film that didn‚Äôt really do anything itself to truly earn much of those emotions. I know that Ghostbusters 2 wasn‚Äôt loved as much as the original, but if it had tried this back in 1989 then no-one ever would‚Äôve talked about it since.",qx6sxk

hla2urt,"The guy is actually right. Originally Gozer was supposed to appear in Shador's form when emerging through the Temple Gate in the original movie and Paul Reubens was to portray the part. In the script Shador/ Gozer was described as ""a small, nondescript little man in a business suit."" It was Ivan Reitman who decided to make Gozer into a New Wave androgynous female. They cast Slavitza Jovan at the last minute.

It didn't need a Gozer or stay puft cameo. It didn't need the EPA guy to come back and wink at the camera. It didn't need Ecto 1 to be reintroduced like it was the millennium falcon. It was just a sequel to Ghostbusters.   

And that s my issue. This movie solely exists as a love letter to Ghostbusters. And if you like it that's great. I'm not calling it the worst thing ever or claiming ""it ruined the franchise"". I just don't get the appeal of that.",qx6sxk

hm7aifj,"That's fair. Personally, I don't really give a shit about the cartoons or toys or any of the Ghostbuster's nostalgia beyond a deep-seeded admiration of the first film. But I can see the logic in a man like Harold Remus not caring. But I think my problem is less with ""would Harold Remis specifically have wanted this"" and more ""should companies be applauded for using the likeness of real-life recently dead people in this way?"" I may be being overly cynical about it, but I find the practice ghoulish. I think it's bad taste, the implications of the precedent it sets are underexamined at best and exploitive at worst. 

The Rise of Skywalker example is not a favorable comparison either. In RoS you have all these short chopped up interactions. People talking AT Leia, not to her, often phrasing things kinda awkwardly in ways that you know it only had to be written so that it could work with what little footage they had. I would refer to it as Frankenstein Film Making, in that they have all these disparate pieces of dialogue here and there, quick responses, split second reactions, and they butcher and chop and sew this back together, working backwards in a way that can't help but feel dispassionate. The ultimate finished project can't help but feel ingenuine. It makes one, or at least it makes me wonder, how much more tasteful it might have been to conceive of a reason for her not to be in the movie in person, to let the absence of her be felt by the audience. Try to find a tasteful way to let her character's presence permeate the story in a way that doesn't require her literal visage. In a movie about space wizards, that 's not that hard to do. 

I'm talking about Good Taste. For instance, I totally didn't mind all of the subtler things the movie was doing to imply the presence of Egon. When his granddaughter is discovering the Lab, we can sense his presence guiding her. I even thought the hand from off-screen helping her near the end was a nice touch. Most if not all of what all of the other ghostbusters said to Egon's ghost was fine, if it hadn't been directed at this CGI approximation of the actual guy. For instance, what if instead, similar to how we were given visual clues that he's there helping when she discovered the lab, what if they were simply aware of the fact that Egon's ghost was present but we couldn't see him, instead they're saying all the things they wish they could have told him in life to the air in the fleeting HOPE that maybe he could hear them and that he'd appreciate their words. At the very least maybe THEY see him, but WE the audience don't. The exact same sentiment is communicated to the audience but without the need for digital corpse puppetry.",qx6sxk

Then they cast Rudd, who is the perfect actor to lead a new team of Ghostbusters. And they stopped there? And they filled the cast out with children?

And then months went by and it became clear that Rudd wasn‚Äôt even playing a Ghostbuster and that the film more of a drama than a comedy. And it also became clear that the returning castmembers were barely in the movie.

- The big box stores use national sales statistics to determine their inventory. Our local hardware store owner has petitioned local contractors to see what it is they need.

I think the relative ""cheapness"" of the budget bled into the script and overall product, though, because there were a number of beats that just weren't addressed. I would have loved to see more of the original 4 before arriving in Summerville -- and we know that Annie Potts and Sigourney were seen on-set together, as per the extras, so I have a strong suspicion there was more content filmed that hasn't been released -- and some of the connective scenes with Callie, because her character was completely short-shifted in the final product.",qx6sxk

I will admit, the first 2/3rds of the movie where it focuses on this element was much more encapsulating then then the latter where it kind of devolves into tropey ghostbusters but even then, the journey we went on up until that point was very enjoyable and the ending segment left a huge smile on my face.

It's a sequel.  It is inherently impossible for it to be wholly original.  You have to accept the lore and the architecture of the franchise to be baked into the experience.  If it were completely, wholly original with no connecting tissue there'd be absolutely no reason for it to be a part of the franchise. 

>If you're going to defend a film defend something that has hought and effort and creativity put into it.

No.  It features the same villain.  The circumstances, setting, and actual action of the 3rd act is entirely different from that of the original.  I sure as hell saw no endless staircases and New York city high rises anywhere.  

>And please done give me that "" they built more on the lore than the first one sid"" give me a break. Oh jk Simmons played a character for 2 seconds song absolutely nothing.

hm7d1r3,"Well, I was mainly thinking of the young Leia lightsaber training flashback in ROS, where it was not stock footage but a new CGI creation.

Of course, remember, these recreations are now done while the actors are alive too, like Carrie in Rogue One. Rogue One also did the dead actor version with Peter Cushing.

I don't really see the problem. I think if I was in the biz, I'd grant my family permission to use my likeness rights after my death as they see fit. And we have interviews with Ramis' daughter now saying she liked what was done here. It's all among family/friends, Jason Reitman and Violet Ramis have been friends since childhood, just as their parents were friends.

I do think it will become a bigger issue in the future as this technology advances. The deepfake stuff seems to be advancing very, very fast. I think all actors now are going to be signing the paperwork to handle how their likeness is handled after death. As an audience member, I don't see the problem if this is approved through the people who control those rights. It could certainly be a case-by-case basis.

There were only 4 ghosts in this scene. Gozer, Vinz, Zuul and Egon, but Egon was not standing on the grid so why would he get trapped? There are holes in this movie, but that's not one of them.

hlo7n16,"There's a lot to unpack here, and I truly want to hear you out. Do you consider paying attention to the extras paying attention to the movie? Is that what you're talking about? 'Cause I was paying attention to, ya know, THE MOVIE part of the movie, in the foreground. And it's right on IMDB: The movie features 30 white people and seven mixed race and/or people of color. It's an extremely white movie, even though it only has tiny marshmallow men instead of a giant one. And it's Oklahoma, not Ukraine.  Moreover, as we've established, there aren't a lot of extras in the movie at all. Plus, in real life, it's actually Alberta, Canada standing in for smalltown Oklahoma, and it's not nor even intended to be an authentic setting that's true to real life; it's a fictional, romanticized, idealized, escapist, Norman Rockwell, focus group-ready, movie-ish, Hollywood studio product version of small town America, untethered by time or truth. GHOSTBUSTERS AFTERLIFE follows a comprehensive, market research-derived, profit-maximizing agenda, so, above all else, it does whatever it needs to do in order to make the most money by catering to the broadest audience with conflicting opinions, desires, ideologies, demographics, etc. But, nonetheless, maybe there's something to what you're saying, because you're not the only person I've seen say this online. Also, I live in southern California, which is rather diverse, so the movie could've easily just looked subjectively more Caucazoid to me than it does to someone who lives somewhere else in the country. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt: If you live, have lived, or visited Oklahoma --which I admittedly never have-- you'd know better than me. So do you or have you?",qx6sxk

hlf3e1w,"There‚Äôs adult content that are so because they would be inappropriate for the kids. And then there is adult content that are so because kids wouldn‚Äôt really get it. Ghostbuster the original is mostly the latter, but with a really cool concept that would grab the attention of the kids who would otherwise be bored. 

The new movie aimed squarely at the kids in us. Which left the adult in us wondering if there is anything fun here for me.

And yah , I get what this movie‚Äôs heart is. Plenty of Spielberg movies already does that , and does better. I watch a movie titled Ghostbusters expecting different things. 

But to each their own, glad this movie satisfied the ones who saw the original as little kid. Now can we get a sequels or remake or spinoff or whatever that is aimed at the adults ?",qx6sxk

hrtwifu,"You lack the faculties to understand English You spew irony and lack of self awareness.

I never said don't have your opinion. You're just negative and toxic as fuck. You're the one literally shitting on a stranger, on their career because they have a differing opinion - again, lack of self awareness and irony here.

Like I said, get off reddit, do something else - you're so rotten (this is an invite to not come back until you've made some self reflections/changes, ""genius""). Your parents failed to discipline you it seems. You are so god damn obtuse, obnoxious and childish.

hld4qv3,As I said in the initial comment I was surprised and pleased by their role.

Anyway:

* The ghost activity picked up in the first one as a result of Dana‚Äôs building

* The ghost activity in Afterlife was prevented from building up because of the machines Egon left behind at the temple. 

* The ghost activity ONLY starts to pic up AFTER Paul Rudd disabled the machines.",qx6sxk

Dana‚Äôs building was the gateway for Gozer. Gozer‚Äôs arrival was imminent, which caused ghosts around the city to increase their activity. Just like Slimer occupied the Sedgewick Hotel for years but became more active when Gozer was about to arrive.

Sorry, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre getting it. It was energy RELEASED from Dana‚Äôs building that caused the increased activity. In Afterlife, that energy was contained.
