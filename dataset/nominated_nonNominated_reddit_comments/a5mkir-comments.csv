The theater CACKLED",a5mkir
ebzi4mi,"This is definitely one of those movies where I left the theater not feeling anything, but the more I think about it the more I loved it. Reading these comments has also put a lot of things in perspective. Each of the three characters were incredibly well-written and defined, with clear motivations. You start out rooting for Abigail but she turns into the very thing that made Sarah unappealing in the first half of the movie. And in the end, all three of them end far worse than when they started (personally, not financially).

* **Anne** - All she wants is something real. All 17 of her children died and she uses her pet rabbits to fill that void. It's also demonstrated when she's wailing throughout the halls and picks up the baby just to hold for a little. She thinks she found true friendship with Abigail, but she had it with Sarah all along. But by the time she realizes it, it's too late and the damage has been done. She ends up alone, with nothing but her pets (Abigail) to keep her company.

* **Sarah** - She claims to love Anne and her country, but loses both in the end. She was conniving and calculating, but like she said, she was playing a different game than Abigail. Her game was politics. Keep the war going, keep her husband and her relevant, and wield power behind the scenes. She manipulated Anne just as Abigail did, but with different goals in mind. I believe she did love Anne in her own way. Love is telling you you look like a badger, not lying that the whole court is always saying how nice your hair is.

* **Abigail** - Fell on hard times and was essentially a prostitute to try and survive. All she wants is to reclaim the good life and will do anything to get there. At first we're meant to root for Abigail, but in retrospect the red flags were there all along. How many times did she lie to get into places she wasn't supposed to be? We chalk it up as being clever or charming, but she's manipulating everyone. While Sarah is playing the political game, she's playing the social one. And once she gets power, she becomes exactly the same as the people we're meant to see as ridiculous in the beginning - drunken behavior, openly cheating and using her husband, squeezing the rabbit. And in the final scene she realizes that despite all of the nice things, she's still essentially a prostitute, there to be used as needed for whatever the queen desires.

**TL;DR** - All three characters are miserable in the end.",a5mkir

ebtxpmy,"The three main leads are amazing, and deserve as much recognition as they can get for this movie. The thing that amused me at the end of the movie, is that the person who gained the most by the end was the Dandy politician guy, who got everything he wanted with no consequences to him. Everyone else arguably is in a worse position than in the beginning, including Emma Stone's character who went from low class prostitute to personal prostitute to the Queen (more or less).",a5mkir

ebtk99u,"I'd reccomend this one to anyone, even to people who weren't fans of Lanthimos' other films. All three of the lead characters are fascinating fully realized monsters, and watching the drama escalate between them was a joy.",a5mkir
ebtkyvz,"Well I didn’t expect a film about 18th-century British royalty to use the word “cunt” as much as it did. The terms **“va-ju-ju”** and **“cuntstruck”** will definitely be ones I’ll remember for a good while. If I could describe the movie in one word, I’d say it’d have to be “unhinged,” as it seems that all three leading ladies were at their wit’s end by the end of the film’s runtime. 

Colman’s portrayal of a queen who is falling apart mentally and physically throughout was pretty interesting to see. She has her moments of humor while also having moments where we learn more about her past and her reign. Stone and Rachel Weistz pull off a pretty believable rivalry throughout, each trying to one up the other for the queen’s affections for their own reasons. I do think that Nicolas Hoult’s character stole the show in just about all of his scenes, show a bit of a detachment of a person with so much wealth and power, all the absurdities are the normalcy. 

The vulgar (yet sharply written) dialogue was a good contrast to the gorgeous views of the British palaces and all of the period attire. At time it really reminded me to 2006's Marie Antoinette, but without the rock music. 

On an off topic note, I couldn’t help but notice that on the schedule for upcoming discussion threads that “Vox Lux” isn’t on the list yet. Is there plans of the film having a discussion thread in the future? At least in my local theaters, it has already started show in some theaters. ",a5mkir
ebu01y7,"This movie was excellent, but I'm surprised how restrained it was. I expected Yorgos to get weirder, but the film really keeps itself composed.

Loved the use of chapter titles / title cards in this. Almost thought it was going for a 5-act Shakespearean tragedy as the movie progressed. But it was still quite tragic (for Emma Stone's Abigail) [or let's be real, for everyone except Nicholas Hoult & Horatio the fastest duck in the city].

ed5ssg2,"I did not enjoy this movie, but have nothing but compliments for the director, the story, and the actresses. Its similar to my feelings about the Lobster - Yorgos Lanthimos has such a distinctive tone and verve that he goes for that I deeply admire. However, it resonates with me at one step removed from enjoyment.

Its good directing in that we constantly shift our allegiance to different characters throughout the movie. One character is portrayed as our ""good"" protagonist, until we realize, much as the characters in the film do, that she is not what she seems. The other character is portrayed as the manipulative antagonist, until we realize she's been poisoned, and that her control was actually beneficial for queen and country. The queen goes from being a hapless character, to being manipulated by multiple characters but playing them off each other, to finally being more decisive.

The actresses and actors do wonders with their roles. They are nuanced, portraying sides of brutishness, playfulness, tenderness, and haughtiness.

The costume design and setting, while not truly historically accurate, fit the ambiance and tone perfectly.

The dialogue, and the comedy is all pitch perfect. There are definitely moments I chuckled, gasped, and were amazed by what happened. The musical cues and choices were unnerving on purpose, and went well with the scenes.

Having said all this, I would be hesitant to recommend this to a friend. I would not rewatch this film. BUT, I do think many things in the movie are award worthy, and that it definitely deserves all the critical accolades it is receiving.

I did not like this film, and yet I would be hard pressed to exclude it from my top 10 list for the year. Much like the movie itself, it is entirely contradictory.

efgaybw,"What jumped out at me the most was the contrast between the way they spoke/carried themselves in such a formal manner, and the absolutely abysmal way they treated eachother.

ec46ezu,"The three leads were all perfect, but the winner of the movie for me was Nicholas Hoult. Don't think I've seen him in anything since Mad Max: Fury Road and he was incredible in this. Haven't really seen any awards buzz around his performance, which is a shame. ",a5mkir
ebtooqo,"I went to see this again after seeing it at Telluride this year. Even better upon a second rewatch. Coleman for me is the one to best this year for Best Actress. I think the best part about the film is that Yorgos didn’t write it. The dialogue and pacing of the writing is so quick throughout that it’s hard to look away or check your phone because things develop so quickly.

One of the things that I think many people might gloss over in comparison to the great acting of the three ladies is the way that they handled the men. Each had their flaws but stylistically is was crazy entertaining to see them interact not only with each other but how the ladies would manipulate them for their own gain.

ebvg346,"I absolutely loved this. Just behind Vox Lux and First Reformed (might even best First Reformed) as my favourite of the year. The ending might be my favorite final scene of the year. As funny as the film is, it's also progressively dark and twisted, and like every Lanthimos I felt pretty, coldly, violated by the ending. Extraordinary performances, Colman deserves best Actress, especially over Gaga who I still love and think was fantastic, but Colman is just on another level here.

Also, Joe Alwyn is A SNACK! Didn't realize that was the same guy from that Billy Lynn movie. ""I'm hard as a rock and it's our wedding nighT!"", and that forest wrestle/chase sequence.

Olivia Colman was hilarious and heartbreaking, Emma Stone was perfectly cast and so fun to watch, as was Rachel Weisz...oh fuck it, everybody was perfectly cast and fun to watch. I loved absolutely everything about it, even when it dragged near the end. I will rewatch the hell out of this film, and will drunkenly clap and cheer when it wins ALL the awards.

I love all of Yorgos's work, but I'm kind of digging the fact that he didn't write this film. He's kind of hard to digest sometimes, and I feel like I have to do some of the mental heavy lifting, but I was able to disconnect, relax, and enjoy every detail of the film. ",a5mkir

I kept thinking that surely this is all an outlandish made-up story, but Queen Anne, Sarah, Abigail, Harley and Masham were all real people.  The Queen really was pretty much as portrayed, and their relationships are broadly based on history.  The main discrepancies are:

(i) The Queen's husband, George, is completely omitted from the movie.  Apparently they shared a bed until his death (which would have made the lesbian relationships kinda hard to manage), and his death was a cause of increased tension between Sarah and Anne.

(ii) Historians don't think there was any sexual relationship between these three women, although Sarah actually accused Abigail of having one with Anne (and did threaten to make Anne's letters to Sarah public; the letters did sound like love letters).

(iii) The bunnies!  There were no bunnies.  Too bad.  I loved the bunnies.

I do wish the tied up the ending *a little* better, but I can see why they didn't think it was necessary. Specifically, though, when Sarah said something like [""Oh, you think you've won?""](#spoiler) to Abigail. My take from this line is that Abigail thought she was in a battle for power with Sarah (which isn't *wrong*) while Sarah understood that [she was what an emotionally and physically scared Queen Anne needed. Without her, the palace would fall victim to the Queen's incompetence. Something I think Abigail finally realizes during the very last shot. And convincing the Queen that Sarah, a former love and best friend was a traitor, only worsened an already poor emotional state. And not only does the Queen lose Sarah's friendship and competence, but she also loses Abigail's kindness and emotional support.](#spoiler)

All in all, there was a lot of depth added to the three main characters over the course of the film that even my first thoughts there don't address. Maybe it's the amount of action movies I've been seeing lately that is making me overrate this movie, but, right now, I can confidently say I was very impressed with this movie. ",a5mkir

Abby won, no need to show a comeback from Sarah that never got going.  The other was the tea scene, Sarah clearly knows she has been poisoned, I thought it was something to make her visit the chamber pot,she just gets up and leaves to go.....well I’m not exactly sure, then while that is going on a naked man is giggling while oranges are thrown at him.

If you're making a period piece (Mary queen of Scots) make the shots engaging. I was completely invested with this film and the rest of the audience. Just Damn near perfect.

Ok so you know at the end when Abigail is rubbing the queen’s leg, was it just me or did it seem like the queen pissed herself? 

I remember the scowl on Abigail’s face turn to a sudden look of surprise and then disgust as she stopped rubbing for a while and the look on the queen’s face of slight embarrassment and relief. There was also this sound effect of water dripping that I could hear quite distinctively. I asked my friend after the show and she said she thought so too but after much digging around online I couldn’t find anything about it. 

Please tell me I’m not the only one. I remember thinking wow these people could not get more miserable and then bam the slow realisation of what the queen had just done and how much lower these people were driven, how disgusting all their actions were, how they were stuck in this equally revolting situation.

On a different note, the scene when Sarah walks in on Abigail in bed with Anne felt uncomfortable and menacing to me.

I’ve been trying to figure out if it’s secretly a horror movie. The soundtrack would be right at home in something like The Shining, and Sarah and Abigail are straight up psychopaths. The poison and fall and being held prisoner and facial wound could all be horror elements with different editing. The bunnies with the names of the queen’s dead children are extremely morbid too. Plus stuff like the unwelcoming feeling of the staff (as opposed to something like Downton Abbey), the lye burns...

The only thing that really bothered me was the use of fisheye.  What reason was there to use fisheye in so many scenes?  In the beginning of the film, I thought it was being done to show the scale of the palace rooms in a way that didn't reduce the size of the actors, in the way a normal wide shot would.  But then it was used over and over, and in scenes where showing scale was not the point.  It exaggerated the size of garments and things at the edge of the frame to the point of looking ridiculous... Maybe that's the reason it was used?  The whole thing *was* a twist on a standard period film - why not use non-traditional photography as well?

edyeiqb,"Gotta say, I did not expect to be feeling the same way at the end of the movie as I did at the end of Breaking Bad. Abigaile crushing that rabbit at the end made me feel bad about rooting for her throughout the movie.

History says that it's more likely that Anne simply grew tired of Sarah's bluntness and was simply looking for a friend to comfort her rather than a lesbian love triangle forming and driving Sarah away, but it certainly made for a good movie. ",a5mkir
eguhqm7,"I think its my 3-4th time ever going online to find information or explanation about a movie. I didnt get it. I had no clue what was it about beyond the typical love triangle. The movie is making fun of that aristocratic era where everyone are dressed nice and are polite to each other, when in public. While back stabbing mean assholes when in person. I was expecting a much deeper meaning like it was with The Lobester. I wanted to find meaning about the fisheye lens, apparently it was used to convey a certain mood out of those big empty halls. I honestly didn't like the movie, I think its done well and it would probably win best costume design or something. Its as almost if was being sarcastic of movies that make fun of that era. ",a5mkir

I honestly felt for her when she looked so vulnerable and jealous.

ecd9ijy,Holy shit fuck my dudes this was the tits. Can't really think of anything bad to say about it. I think out of the other three Yorgos Lanthimos films I've seen this one is the most approachable if you're not into the surreal or sort of disjointed way his other movies tend to be. The Lobster and Killing of a Sacred Deer felt distinct because of their odd ball concepts and presentation which made me get very attached. They had a fantastic and unique voice that struck a balance between dark humor and disturbing. It was sort of the flat manner of speaking that assisted both of these aspects. You'd hear Barry Keoghan reveal his twisted plot in a plain manner or see how Colin Farrell would react to his spouse [killing his dog/brother](#spoiler) and it would be incredibly jarring. For The Favourite the dialogue is more dynamic which can be a positive or a negative thing depending on who you ask. For me I felt that for the type of humor the film wanted to convey it worked great. This is probably his funniest movie so far. I loved how each of the female leads had there own  motives that ultimately amount to wanting some level of control over their own lives. Emma Stone's characterization is done brilliantly. It's so intriguing watching her character be able to go between playing the sweet and innocent maid to a manipulative and devious person that she really is. I also love how Lady Sarah feels like the villain at the start but I wound up sympathizing with her by the end. Nicholas Hoult was so blunt and had such amazing comedic timing. Olivia Spencer was an absolute delight. Her changing moods either slowly or drastically was always convincing and moments where she had to get comically emotional was done exceptionally well. Not sure if this or Isle of Dogs was my favourite film this year but I can see this one taking it easy such a fascinating movie please see it. ,a5mkir
ed50tvz,"This movie was an utter shock to me. I was dragged in and expected be half asleep 30 minutes in. I'm glad that I was wrong. The movie was astonishing, brilliant, and one of the best movies I've seen involving this type of movie trope. ",a5mkir

Knowing Lanthimos’s movies, I told my girlfriend the couple sitting next to us would maybe last twenty minutes. Almost on cue, right after that first scene with Sarah and the Queen, that couple got up and walked out 😂.",a5mkir
ebvzcw0,"Definitely a contender for favorite movie this year for me, beautifully acted and shot. Just surreal and bizarre enough, I agree with everyone here saying this is the director’s most accessible film. I was most impressed with Emma Stone; Olivia and Rachel were so wonderful to watch in different ways, but I really feel like Emma went for it in ways I wasn’t expecting. Never been her biggest fan but this has me feeling like I need to go back and watch some of her movies I may have missed. Her comedic timing is pretty impeccable. ",a5mkir
edg9sdt,Reminiscent of phantom thread. I love the ambiguity of drama and comedy coming to light and just the weirdness of both movies and how it highlights these strange relationships. The thing that really connects imo is the amazing cinematography. Some amazing shots I’ve really never seen before. The 360 shot then to the tracking shot of Emma stone in the queens chambers was so beautiful   ,a5mkir

Beautiful throughout, and a great character piece for each of the 3 ladies. My only criticism is that sometimes the comedy is a little too slapstick at times. Beyond that, amazing! Would love to go see it again soon. ",a5mkir

ecmyy8i,"""The Favorite"" is a meticulously crafted baroque film that relies on visuals and subtexts to tell the tale of two rival cousins as they battle to appease their Queen. The film follows Abigail Hill (*Emma Stone*) as she attempts to regain her lost social status by seeking employment through her cousin, and Queen's Confidante, Sarah Churchill (*Rachel Weisz*). Between the two lay Queen Anne (*Olivia Colman*), a simple-minded ill lady who seeks nothing more than life's pleasures regardless of how they affect her. Abigail's climb and rivalry is the centerpiece of the main plot. Throughout her journey she is taken advantage of, belittled, and implemented as a tool for a grander scheme. However, she rises to the top by being shrewd, crafty, and observant. It's her story that the audience is made to care for the most. Her cousin, Sarah, goes through a similar development but in the opposite direction, and Queen Anne's journey is the most sympathetic because her story leads to a cruel actualization of the world around her. 

All three leading ladies bring their best to the role. The weakest would have to be Emma Stone by a fraction of a margin due to her struggles to maintain an English accent. Olivia Colman's acting is outstanding and it's worth the price of admission alone. Forget the cinematography or plot. See this film just for Olivia Colman's portrayal of Queen Anne. Rachel Weisz plays Sarah in a sincere and strict manner. She makes the audience dislike her character before having them second guess their initial opinions of her character.

The film is directed beautifully. Yorgos Lanthimos extracts the most from his camerawork and set (*there are about two or three locations within the movie*) to provide an illusion of baroque England. He also takes advantage of the costume and lighting as well. His attention to fine detail can be seen throughout the film from beginning to end. The cinematography is captivating. From zoom-ins to the utilization of wide-angle lens, nothing feels left out in this film. If it is seen, then it's meant to be seen. 

Overall, The Favorite is a well-crafted piece of film that carries its audience to early 17th century England to show them a feud between family members over social standing and political favor. Olivia Colman's acting would enamor anyone who sees it, and the directing, cinematography, and costumes are delightful. See this film at least twice in theaters. 

**Notes**

* ""The last person in the room"" has a whole new meaning 
* What books were Abigail reading? Were they only poetry texts?
* There is no way that the Queen's ""nightlife"" was not unknown in a castle where each hallway has 20 servants
* The fact that the major political parties pushed their agendas through both Abigail and Sarah implies that they knew on some level of how much the Queen valued them
* That final scene had me awestruck
* Abigail's the definition of a masochist
* The clashing duality of old vs young was over-apparent in the film
* Why did that horse ran straight to the local brothel?",a5mkir

ebtkfk2,The Yorgos touch was present but quite restrained - it’s very evident he didn’t write this. Selfishly I expected something much more bizarre than a period drama lesbian love triangle.

&#x200B;

edi6245,"It's so interesting seeing so much elaborate detail put into a movie like this, and to still have so many silly bits of humor. Like the lobster racing and the ""LOOK AT ME, HOW DARE YOU! CLOSE YOUR EYES!"" scenes. You usually don't get both of those. It's also interesting that this movie has been described as Lanthimos's ""most assessable film"", because I found Lobster and Sacred Deer to be way easier to get into.

Overall, I really liked that they took their creative liberties with this script. There are just too many movies right now that are based on true stories that it's cool to see something at least ""loosely based"" on something. ",a5mkir
edpga7n,"As with 'The Lobster', I wondered at times if the film was much more than the sum of its - admittedly extremely entertaining and, given the staidness of most costume dramas, refreshing - eccentricities. There's undoubtedly a pretentiousness to both movies that seems somewhat adolescent. But on the whole I really enjoyed it, found it very funny and enjoyed the determined weirdness of it. Most of all, I liked how it showed the filth and nastiness of an endlessly romanticised era, albeit in a surreal/grotesquely exaggerated way. It was 'Barry Lyndon' by way of recent British comedy (I'm constantly reminded of stuff like 'Jam' and 'Peep Show'). 

The last shot has haunted me since watching it a few days ago. It was mysterious and suggestive in a way the rest of the movie wasn't - the rest of the movie was more comical and crass.",a5mkir

eda30mv,"I adored this film. Coleman, Stone and Weisz could all justifiably win awards. Nicholas Hoult is only 29 and building up quite the resume. Lanthimos films are always so odd in the best sense. This film is no different. The music is a character of its own. The editing and direction are both phenomenal. I laughed the whole way through. The rabbits, the dance and the James Corden lookalike are my highlights. I don’t normally go for period films but The Favourite blew me away. I think this may just sneak a Best picture win.",a5mkir

Only now just realized the same guy directed The Lobster and Killing of a Sacred Deer. I hate those films and this one is so good!

ebtuk1u,"Really, really loved it. Went in relatively blind and was shocked at how subversive, clever, funny, and twisty it was. 

Excellent performances from the three leads, and fun supporting roles. Loved the pacing, and really felt like it built towards the moral play/gut punch in a way that was satisfying but not completely hamfisted. Managed to make me feel like  justice was served all around while simultaneously making me feel like it was tragic or pitiable. Excellent writing. 

Set design and costumes were top notch and the absurd exaggerations played straight were delightful. 

I totally get and respect the decisions the director made with the unbalanced framing, weird lens choices, and some other strange camera movements. But ultimately I didn’t love the style. It was still neat to see a setting usually presented elegantly so informally shot though. 

The lighting was incredible throughout, with those two shots of Rachel Weisz in the dark with only a candle being my favorite. 

I didn’t really dig the score, but the few full orchestrations and the one song in the middle were beautiful. The extended periods of two notes being played repeatedly just felt a little more irritating than tension inducing for me personally. 

Strongly recommend. 8/10 for me. I was entertained and engaged every moment. ",a5mkir

I really liked how each character came in with a very defined character trait, (Coleman is weak and childish, Stone is innocent, Weisz is cold and calculating) but they all grow a lot and show different sides (Coleman’s depression and spite, Stone’s calculating and vicious side, and Weisz’s genuine affection for the Queen). Plus the camera work, set design, and costuming is pitch perfect (shoutout to whoever decided to use fish-eye lenses).",a5mkir

ebub7t8,I loved Dogtooth when I saw it originally and liked The Lobster. Didn't like Killing of a Sacred Dear but was excited to see what Lanthimos would do next. And wow this blew me away. And I think a big part of it is the brilliant script which was not written by him. I think Lanthimos is a brilliant director but he's been repeating himself ever since Dogtooth and I found his movies to be increasingly cold and filled with archetypes rather than characters. This movie excels because it matches a brilliant script with three really rich characters and Yorgos' incredible skills as a director. And the three leading performances are brilliant. Definitely one of my favorites of the year. ,a5mkir
eccgs3z,"The first assistant director was present in my showing (I watched it a couple of months ago) and he spoke a little about the film and the director Yorgos before the film started. He said Yorgos thought Killing of a Sacred Deer was a comedy film and this film is heavy drama. It is so interesting to me because KoaSD was such a wild and intense ride I remember that I couldn't even breathe while watching it. But this one was (even though it was as sad as KoaSD) definitely hilarious.

I loved it loved it loved it. The characters, dialogues, costumes, cinematography, acting... It was top notch. Even though it is historically wrong about most of the things, it didn't matter. Olivia Coleman is the best thing ever to happen lately and I can not get enough of her. Can not wait to watch her as Elizabeth.",a5mkir
ecjvuza,"Wow, I thought this was going to be some completely serious historical drama, but it's more than that and I'm glad. Aside from some lingering shot like Anne's listening to the music at the party or the very long shot at the end, this doesn't feel like some pretentious, artsy film. The dialogue while having some subtext can be blunt at times and often in a comedic way(not verbatim):

""Are you here to rape or seduce me.""

""Please I'm a gentleman.""

""Rape me then.""

Also I love Sarah(Rachel Weisz looks amazing for 48 just to note) and her ""take no shit"" from anyone attitude. Some of her insults are savage. It's amazing how she's set up to be a villain, but by then you realize how conniving Abigail is. And what is why the film is excellent, the character relations, dialogue, and performances make you oscillate from caring to thinking a character is a bitch. The story leaves you guessing with what's going to happen now and you're compelled to find out.

Also noteworthy is Emma Stone's English accent. It feels natural and not too overly done. 

This is a very refreshing movie that I can recommend if you need a break from all the December Blockbusters and Christmas.",a5mkir

Abigail might have come to be the New Lady but spiritually and mentally Sarah was much above Abigail. And they both knew that .

This film was beyond gorgeous even in its vulgarity. I was super put off by the brash use of that harsh fish-eye lens and abrupt camera rotation at first, as well as the LOW camera angles, but over the course of the film I stopped noticing it and took it as a sort of claustrophobic framing of the story.

Even with the great cast and acting, the script did not make me care for the events in the movie. The drama was good, but it was a long slow burn with little satisfaction of the ending. 
Cinematography was really good at times, doing interesting perspectives and using fisheye/wide lenses to create more unique feeling, but then it would have a quick pan every once in a while that would make me dizzy. The classical music was selected well and appropriate for the time, but there was one piece that they composed for this that had the same octave played by a violin for probably two minutes straight that was so boring yet annoying that it distracted me from the events of the movie then.

My biggest problem with the movie is that it kinda lost it’s pace in the third act. I think it’s because Weisz’s character wasn’t around as much. But the ending left my theatre speechless.

This is definitely Yorgos’ most commercial and accessible movie compared to what I’ve seen of his (Dogtooth and The Killing of a Sacred Deer) and I believe that the recognizable actresses play a large role in that. But it’s still a Yorgos movie for sure.

I don’t think this movie is for everyone. After the movie I couldn’t help but to think how much my college “bros” would have hated it and been bored. But I really enjoyed it. Go see it. I give The Favourite 4/5 stars.",a5mkir

Definitely an odd, somewhat art-house, and even vulgar kind of black comedy about power dynamics, sex, and class, but I guess that's what you get with Yorgos Lanthimos. I really want to check out more of his work now, having seen this and _The Lobster_ and really digging both. Emma Stone steals the show with what I'd say is the best performance I've seen her give, but each of the principals are great, weaving terrific non-verbal touches into their performances on top of a sharp screenplay. Would expect at least one of them (my guess being Stone) to be in the Oscar picture next February. Cinematography and costuming are really striking as well - I'd be mildly shocked not to see these also get awards noms. Overall, high marks here, even though I don't typically seek out period pieces.

This movie kind of felt like Lanthimos lite, but not at all in a bad way, where alot of the absurd nature of his previous movies were toned down his direction was noticeably better. Technically its brilliant, its rare to for me to watch a movie and think 'wow this editing is great'. 

The 3 main leads were all fantastic but Weisz just takes it for me, probably more due to her character but she deserves full credit for pulling it off. Holt was also very good in a completely over the top preposterous way.

I may be reading too much into it. 

I’m also curious about the fruit that was thrown at the naked nobleman. I remember a comment somewhere that it was a pomegranate. Were those considered a luxurious food in England then?

For *The Favourite*, the performances were great, not that I'm breaking any ground by saying that. I particularly liked Nicholas Hoult in this. The movie is pretty sharply written, it's funny and interesting, and I was invested in the characters and the plot. I mostly liked Lanthimos style and thought the movie looked great(the lone exception being the use of fisheye shots, which I get but don't really like).

Final thing: does anybody have screen time numbers for Weisz, Stone, and Colman?  Because I was a little shocked to see Colman getting all the buzz for Best Actress. I think she gives the best performance and deserves the praise, but this definitely felt like Stone's movie to me.",a5mkir

ecgi80x,"Enthralling from the very beginning and bursting with enthusiasm, this endlessly funny period piece, mixed with a ravishing love triangle, is Lanthimos at his most accessible, all while maintaining the mordacious social commentary and absurdist tone that made him such a phenomenon. Needless to say, ""The Favourite"" is marvelously shot, capturing with elegance the grandeur of its setting through gorgeous steadicam and extravagant wide angles, but what really sets it apart are the characters that are shown against it. Arguably the most fascinating showcase of acting from each of its three leads, the dynamics of the trio are effervescent, chock-full of disdainful side-glances, sharp smiles and lascivious touches, making every man look like a disposable accessory. Weisz is ever caustic as Sarah Churchill, the queen's confidant and lover, who actually rules the kingdom through her, and Stone is ravishing as Abigail, Sarah's cousin, who plays a naïve, gleeful servant, but secretly will spare no efforts in order to become the queen's new favourite. However, it is Colman who steals the spotlight, through her mesmerizing performance of Queen Anne. Infantile and broken, impulsive and lustful, needy and erratic all at once, she takes credit for almost every one of the most iconic moments of the film, which are several, through her delicious tantrums and hilarious excesses, but most notably, through a few long, mathematically precise close-ups, during which her expression changes so subtly, yet so richly, that she conveys an extensive array of emotions, disarming the viewer with desperate loneliness and melancholy. All of that innovating and beguiling experience could never have been made possible without an incredibly solid script, whose segmented structure and whimsically titled chapters make the audience anticipate, with an expectant smile, what kind of wicked schemes and betrayals will come next. While it is riveting and lively until two thirds well into the plot, some of the viewers might be left disappointed at how it becomes hopeless and dark. The sudden change of pace, however, is deliberate and calculated, leading to a visually unforgetable ending scene, as each of the characters finally realize the inescapable consequences of their extravagant behaviours. Ultimately, ""The Favourite"" is an admirable confluence of talent, whose likes mainstream cinema only glimpses rarely, and that will leave audiences marveled and eager for more.",a5mkir

The cinematography in this film was also very odd. The consistent use of the wide lensed static cameras made it feel like I was watching from a go pro or a security camera. I found it really distracting when it was used.

edxjsfi,"this film is a wishy washy piece of 'punk-Baroque' . dont  get me wrong, I did enjoy it, most of it.

Without bothering to read up on the film, the lesbian Queen storyline surprised me a bit as I wasn't expecting any lesbianism at all, and it was original, considering plenty of English kings have been gay and handed out huge privildges to their favourites. After Queen Anne's lesbian lover is revealed, she suddenly takes on a Tom-boy persona, shown wearing trousers etc, which really exaggerates what I earlier describes as 'punk Baroque', likewise the constant profanties seem to be something the British public have had severed to them in costume dramas over the last 20 years, either its producers and directors running out of ideas or an audience who want a Quentin Tarantino approach to dialogue, I'm not sure, but at times I do tire of this. I do enjoy the cynical humour.

Regarding the actual photography of the film I felt it lacked a particular style, it seemed to be a mixed bag of camera shots and focus, lots of nice shots of English royal palaces, and lighting, at times it was delightful, but other times, I found the fish-eye wide rather nauseous. Some of the later candlelit scenes were a clear hommage to [this painting] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_the_Air_Pump#/media/File:An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby,_1768.jpg), however towards the end of the film it was obvious no ending was possible and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that several endings had been shot and the director added the disconnected rabbit montage after several sleepless nights with an film which they couldnt work out how to end.

The film it self seems like a [Women's Hour] (https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb) version of [Barry Lyndon.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lzSoKOs1fc), the narrative being focused on women as decision makers. with identity politics being very trendy right now, its no surprise this film got funded by Film4, the BFI, National Lottery funding, and the Irish Film Board. 

the attitude of film making in-which the creative team seem to be attempting to please the audience or financiers with an 'agreeable' yet unfinished story-line soils any possibility at making a great piece of art. too many chefs spoil the broth, and in this case the chefs have spoilt the cinematography ",a5mkir
ed8sz31,"I'm a big, big fan of costume drama's, and I have to give the cast & crew credit for really going outside of the box here.  Especially props to Emma Stone who I thought was gonna be awful.  It's beautifully shot, totally unique among this sort of film, and it has a lot of layers to peel back.

That being said, the film is slightly boring.  It's not slow, it's just isn't all that exciting; you aren't enchanted and taken away to different time period.  The male characters were not well written.  They were well acted, especially Hoult, but they had zero depth and seemed to be caricatures of what men were like then.

The chapter gimmick added nothing to the film imho, it was jarring and unnecessary.  Despite my criticisms, I still think it was a nice film.  What really shines is the creativity within this particular genre.  I hope this inspires others to go outside the box more often with the period pieces.      
",a5mkir
ebu62xk,"The cinematography was so amazing the shots and angles that were used compliment the whimsical yet dire nature of the writing and overarching plot. There's no dolly shots(I assume their dolly shots) in this film to make Spike Lee jealous and I never seen the fish eye lens be you so much and conventional film, the only other time I've seen it use in general really, is in retro skate videos. The acting is stellar, the score is great, the set design and makeup (which are things I don't typically pay attention to) were great and drag you into the film. 

Now what I think can hold this film back for people is the ending, it's vague, it's weird, and it's kinda of long. With that being said, even tho I don't really understand it...yet, I fucking love the ending, to say that he least the last scene was interesting and it lasted so long that in the middle of my confusion I was hoping it would be the  end of the film because it was so artsy and jarring, I thought it would be a perfect way to end what I thought was an interesting and enjoyable avant garde film. Then the rabbits started to appear and I knew it was the end...for me at least.

My favorite scene in the film is the impromptu Soul Train line dance scene... I wasn't expecting it and it took me a sec to catch on to it, but as soon as I caught on I was lovin ever second of it...then the queen decided to stop them.

I didn’t find it funny. The only attempts at humour I noticed were making the characters swear which was just incredibly lazy. I guess there was the bit on the wedding night, but it seemed so strange, cringey and out of place that it was more suited to an Austin Powers movie. There were only a very few sporadic laughs from the audience, mostly at the early shock of the swearing though was never more than one or two people laughing.

The plot was so messy. One of the apparent driving forces was the story of the war with France. Should they sue for peace? Should they press on and win another great battle? What if Marlborough himself is killed? It doesn’t matter! There was so much time taken up with discussion and exposition of this yet it had zero consequences towards anything. After much deliberation and changing her mind, Anne decides to make peace. Finally, some drama and interest! No, wait, literally nothing happens as a result of this. Even when she forces the whigs to resign from government and puts the Tories in place, nothing at all happens. No drama or consequences.

All the characters were throughly unlikeable. I had no sympathy for any of them nor any engagement. The picture that they painted of Anne was awful by turning her into a screaming, infantile idiot. Both Sarah and Abigail were horrible.

There was a weird, quiet atmosphere at the end when everyone was leaving, I heard several people saying things such as ‘that was really weird’, ‘what was that?’ The overall feeling I got was that it was simply an excuse for the director to film the lesbian sex scenes.

There was no personal struggles that normally elevate a drama.  Nor was there any morale conflicts that make stories profound.  It’s just a plot that two women try to outlast and undermine each other.  It’s not even a drama because the entire story telling could be done in 10 minutes.   I am all for dramas and quite used to films filled with long dialogues, still camera works and slow pace but this one just puzzles me with unimpressive simplicity.

But the problem is it's a highly character driven piece, and about two thirds of the way through there's a plot hole that makes none of the characters make sense anymore. It's a plot hole that could've easily been avoided, but wasn't. After that point both Emma Stone's and Rachel Weisz's characters become a bit baffling, and suddenly the movie feelsa bit aimless and starts to drag. Which is a shame, because it feels like this movie is so close to living up to the awards hype. But then the writers just couldn't close it out right.",a5mkir

ebtptqz,"I believe the rabbits represent Abigail. Abigail is shown stepping on the rabbit, followed by the queen forcing Abigail to massage her legs while using Abigails head for support. She was holding down Abigail in a demonstration of power just like Abigail was holding down the rabbit. I believe this connects back to Sarah asking Abigail if she really believes that she won. Being the queens servant is not victory, it’s a prison in the same way the rabbits are caged. Conversely, Sarah in her exile is more liberated than Abigail thus Sarah is the victor. ",a5mkir
ebtnbhk,"I think there's a couple things. The rabbits absolutely represented the kids she'd lost, but overlaying them with Abigail seemed to me to convey that Abigail was one of them as well, and by extension, so were all those who'd served her in some capacity. Her children were her subjects, who waited on her hand and foot. Took care of her in her ailing old age. 

The thing I loved, though, was how Abigail essentially ended up right back where she started. She worked as a prostitute before the events of the movie, worked her way up to be the Queen's handmaid, and then the final shot is her her rubbing the Queen's leg in a way that makes it look like she's just jerking her off. Doesn't matter how far she's come, she's still just stroking someone else's cock for a bit of money and security. The same way she did before, and the same way she did with her husband on her wedding night. Just that this time, the dick is the Queen's. ",a5mkir

Emma Stone has found herself back as a subservient  sexual slave.

ebtnjh5,"She's in a sea of sorrow at that point and the seemingly endless swarm of rabbits represent that. 

She already had lots of loss up to that point but she's banished away the only person who seemed to put real effort into caring for her and her obligations. In her place is someone who tricked her way into a high position to get whatever she desires and only pretends to say what she thinks the queen wants to hear along with empty pleasures.

After these two scenes it made the whole end of the movie feel a bit mystifying and like it was dragging a bit.

I think the rabbits symbolize her feeling dead inside as she realizes this. ,a5mkir
efdz2i0,I dont know about pissing herself but there is something there. There is the realization that the queen is little more than a petulant moron who is wildly imbalanced. The overlay of the rabbits indicated her station. She has no power or control. To the queen she is just like the rabbits in the cage and a resource to be leveraged when she sees fit. Sarah worked hard for a while to get to a point of being able to manage her and Abagail stepped in thinking it was going to be simple.

The dawning horror on Abigail's face as she seems to realise what the Queen is doing and that in spite of everything she's back to where she started at the court; on her knees burning her hand.

ef9e1xf,"It's a film about power and the duplicity of both 'favourites's love for the Queen – does Weisz's character actually love the Queen or is she just interested in the geopolitical influence their relationship gives her? I believe the answer is both. Abigail is clearly after material wealth and power, as a reaction to her family's fall from grace. The film is also a critique of the period drama, and the foolishness of trying to create glossy recreations of an era we can't hope to full understand from an ontological perspective, yet try to depict with the same realism we depict contemporary drama. This comes through in the slight period inaccuracies in the costume and set, and then the overt use of anachronistic turns of phrase in the dialogue. It is very maximalist visually  and Brechtian in its dramaturgy – it isn't attempting to be neorealist, it's trying to destabilise the audience's expectations and is unabashedly presenting itself as a farcical model of reality. All of Yorgos' films are farces, which resist giving the audience easy interpretations, and instead confront them in uncomfortable ways with sociological and political themes. Just my read on it of course, but I think it reflects some of the critical discourse around the film.

The movie is making fun of that aristocratic era where everyone are dressed nice and are polite to each other, when in public. While back stabbing mean assholes when in person. I was expecting a much deeper meaning like it was with The Lobester. I wanted to find meaning about the fisheye lens, apparently it was used to convey a certain mood out of those big empty halls. I honestly didn't like the movie, I think its done well and it would probably win best costume design or something. Its as almost if was being sarcastic of movies that make fun of that era.

It also satirizes power and more importantly, the need human beings have of congratiating themselves with power while treating those below them as shit. I think it's obvious that this is not a love triangle for Abiagail doesn't love Queen Anne but loves the luxury and convenience that comes with being the queen's lover, she also rejoices in the fact that she managed to get rid of Sarah. 

A character analysis of Abigail, the real protagonist, reveals the story's hidden layers. 

Abigail's main objective in life was to become powerful enough to never again be exploited or abused by others, her condition as a lower class woman had condemned her to a life of poverty, humilliation and rape so when the opportunity came to improve her life situation, she took it. By the end of the movie though, she understands that she hasn't freed her self from being a servant since the queen regards her, not as her equal the way Sarah was, but as a caregiver and sex toy. Abigail at one point monologues on how difficult her life has been by comparing it to a maze to which she constantly has to find her way out of, only to find another obstacle in her way. In the end she finds herself trapped definitely in a prision rather than a maze for there's no way out of it. ",a5mkir

By showing these huge spaces even bigger and more distorted, and seeing everything within the space, and seeing how small the people can be in that space, it just felt that it represented a lot of themes in the film.

That was the whole point of the movie, I think: the fact that our actions have consequences, and many times we must live with our choices no matter what. /u/Apollo_Danger has a great comment in this thread summing up the story arcs of all three characters. The misery that they all had in the end was brought upon them by their own actions, and they all had to live with it. We're left to question how much each character regretted their choices and what they have to live with now. To me it's not unfinished, it's the reality of their actions and what they get out of it. The Queen betrayed her best friend for a new person and is all the more lonely and miserable for it. Abigail moved her way to the top so she could get away from being a slave in life, but she got herself right back to being a slave, just a different kind. Sarah tried to manipulate to get her way as well, but she lost the game since she was playing a completely different game from what Abigail was. In the end she lost everything.",a5mkir

The fish-eye lens was a bit overdone but if that's whats required to capture the scene, so be it.

All three women are left worse off compared to the start of the movie:

1. The Queen has lost her best friend/lover; is still at the mercy of her health conditions; is still tormented by the loss of her children and is perpetually reminded by the rabbits; her new 'friend' Abigail has just been exposed as being not as kind as she appeared.
2. Abigail has gone from hoping to be a maid and having an open ended future to being trapped in a role of servitude to the Queen. She has regained her station as a Lady and gotten rid of her rival Sarah, but is stuck in a loveless marriage, and now realizes that her manipulation of the Queen has resulted her in being stuck in a demeaning role.
3. Sarah has gone from having the power of the throne and being with her best friend/lover, to being scarred, kicked out of power by Abigail, and expelled from England.

She was fond of the man who sold his young daughter in a poker game to be raped and belittled? Who went crazy and burned himself alive, ruining his family in the process? How do we know this ""fondness"" wasn't of a patronizing nature? Or, how do we know it wasn't fabricated whole clothe as a way to passive aggressively attack Abigail? She fondly remembers the man who sold Abigail in a poker game and began her period of suffering? That would tilt me the wrong way for sure if I were Abigail, and perhaps that was Sarah's intention. 

Granted, there is some historical basis to all this, but I don't exactly think you are supposed to come away from this movie ""knowing"" anything, as far as character emotions/intentions are concerned. As I see it, the movie explores the ambiguity of love/power relationships and how they can be manipulated towards selfish ends. Ultimately, I think the movie wants you to leave questioning if that's even a bad thing, or if there even is a ""good"" answer. Instead, its just a highly subjective cost/benefit analysis where there is no clear objectivity (a main theme of [postmodernism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU1-YJbuCrI)). I think the audience is supposed to sympathize most with the Queen, and she is our instrument through which we gauge outcomes. 

At the beginning, the Queen isn't in a good place, relative to our expectations of someone in her position. It is obvious to see. Sarah is basically de facto Queen and controlling her decisions in regard to ruling England. She is psychologically in anguish, unconcerned with her responsibilities as Queen, and clearly depressed. The audience sees Sarah as the cause of this, and rightfully so in some regards. Abigail seems to swoop in and save the day. Freeing the Queen from Sarah's control, mending her body, and re-instilling agency in her. However, is she in a better or worse spot at the end? That's hard to say. It becomes obvious that Abigail was, foremost, using her for personal gain. Her body has clearly declined even further, and she is wholly grotesque. BUT, she has regained agency in ruling and seems more self confident. So, were her ""trade offs"" worth it? How would you even go about quantifying it in an attempt to find out? 

All that is to say, I really enjoyed the film, and its given me a lot to think about! I am definitely researching the real life versions of these characters too. 


",a5mkir
edkvgd1,"I read a biography of John Churchill a couple of years ago, and in actual history, Sarah and Abigail's family were (while being gentry) fairly ""lowly"", perhaps right on the cusp between being ""gentlemen"" and middle class. Sarah was seen as being beneath her husband, John Churchill, who himself wasn't from one of the really great families of the land, and his father (who was called Winston) wanted John to marry someone else. So, in real life, Sarah schemed her way first into being John's wife (not his mistress) and then into becoming the most important person in Anne's life. It was John and Sarah who made the Churchills one of the most powerful families in England, so much so that one of their granddaughters was seen as a potential wife for the Prince of Wales. I really enjoyed the film, but I think if it had given the hint that Sarah had made a very similar climb to Abigail (as she did in history) it would have given the film a different feel, and maybe made Sarah a little more sympathetic if it had come out towards the end of the film when we were meant to sympathise with her.",a5mkir

Also, amazing how just because this one guys films feel trite, bland, and overproduced, the very definition of- and I hate to use this word- *pretentious* as a pejorative, you can conclude that somehow all the movies I *do* enjoy are not worth watching and I should, what, not watch movies because I'm not interested in this specific one?

I'll be the first to admit though that my taste in film is a little odd, to say the least.

edc10yz,"I don't understand why you would adopt a simplistic interpretation that requires her to a be static character. 

I see character development, where her care for the queen is genuine but her motives include self preservation and restoration of the status she lost earlier in life. Not to mention gratitude and loyalty for Sarah (remember when she turned down the role of informant?). Abigail consciously abandons her moral restraint in order to come out on top in her conflict with Sarah, before completing her fall from grace just as she achieves all of her material and social goals. Her choices have spoiled her relationship with both Sarah and the Queen, and her victory is empty. What do you think she was crying about while reading Sarah's letter?

Basically, if the whole planet is lauding a film for its story and characters, and your interpretation is that the protagonist was one-dimensional and static, you had better take another look at your interpretation. 'Did bad things' =/= 'not a good person'. That's, like, the most common theme of all literature and fiction.",a5mkir

egr8ar4,"This is a lazy critique. While a movie could theoretically be about something absurd to anybody watching it if they choose to have that opinion, a better way to analyze it is to actually use clues and context in the movie itself to analyze the ending. 

Of course there are no ""right"" answers, but there is a difference between me saying the rabbits are representative of the Queen's many regrets and a lifetime of sadness trying to compensate for the grief of having no one love her (hence the stand ins for her children superimposed over her while she literally realizes no one in the world truly gives a shit about her) and me saying something like ""the rabbits are a stand in for Mussolini and Emma Stone is a stand in for fascism in the 1920s"". One is using context given in the movie and the other is me saying some random shit. 

I'm willing to listen to arguments against this interpretation and other ideas that are backed up by the movie and the themes, but ""that's just your opinion man"" without any actual argument isn't really something I'm interested in. If you just say it's ""really strange"" without any reason, why should I care? You're ignoring the reasons that I laid out for you using the movie itself without any sort of counter argument of your own. You can't just say ""source?"" over and over again for the interpretation of a movie ending. 

But since you're being so weird about having someone other than me lay out the obvious for you, you can read an analysis of the same thing I'm telling you [here](http://collider.com/the-favourite-ending-explained/#images), [here](https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-favourite.html) and [here](https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/favourite-ending-explained-those-rabbits-13807694). I literally just googled ""favourite ending rabbits explained"" Like honestly, it's pretty apparent in the film, this isn't some sort of super amazing new interpretation by me.

egr96mu,"I linked you external analyses that say the same obvious things that I told you, since that's what you asked for. You can't just plug your ears and expect to be taken seriously. Read them if you don't believe me. 

Your ""perspective"" doesn't mean anything if it's wrong. The rabbits were introduced as the Queen's way of compensating for her grief and regret over her lost children. They are superimposed over the Queen's face as she finally realizes the true nature of her life, that no one actually cares about her and she was just used for a power play. She's alone in the world.

The regrets and grief and the way she used to tried and failed to compensate for that (the rabbits) are then representative of a lifetime of sadness from an incredibly tragic character. If you think that's ""random"" you're gonna have to come up with some analysis or counter argument, not some bullshit like ""all interpretations are equally true"" or whatever your ""perspective"" is.

 I'm willing to listen to an actual argument against what seems to be a relatively straight forward interpretation of the ending based on the movie, not this BS that pretends that it's as equally a good interpretation as assuming the rabbits represented the moon landing or something wacky. That's not how this works, and it's really weird you think that it is. ",a5mkir

Meanwhile, **There Will Be Blood** is a gorgeous movie, very well acted, very well put together, and none of that drags it up out of the pit of having nothing to say and a shitty story to tell, sulking off in the end into the most trite moral of for a drama ever. 

Technical aspects are seasoning, not substance.",a5mkir
egr9nmo,">* Without Sarah to care for her, Anne really and truly is left with no one who loves her, just her rabbits — the stand-ins for her true happiness — and the very manifestation of her trauma and grief take over the screen until they multiply and are all that remain.

>* The rabbits on screen hark back to Anne's tale of her miscarriages. Her personal tragedy, losing her 17 children, takes over the screen. Her grief and sadness envelope her and Abigail visibly on screen, until that's all that's left.

>* the queen’s desperate desire for unconditional love, the love of the children she doesn’t have, has led her to cast off the one person who truly cared about her. All she’s left with are rabbits.

There you go. You've taken to being pedantic instead of thinking for five seconds. That's sad. ",a5mkir
