dbj5l3h,Both Denzel and Viola Davis were amazing. I find it strange that Viola Davis was nominated for Best *Supporting* Actress for the Golden Globes. She was integral to the film and was a major lead character.,5jutlo
dbjk2ja,"Love the acting, it's really strong. Some great monologues and the first 20 minutes or so at home is when the dialogue really flies crisply between characters. Lots of baseball too for a big fan was nice.
However, I felt like there was nothing cinematic about this whatsoever. It wasn't exactly worthy of the adaptation in that sense, in that there was no reason this couldn't just remain a play. No intermission, either, so it dragged a bit.",5jutlo
dbmzied,This movie was so awkward to watch with my family. We didn't know that there were any themes of cheating in this movie before seeing it and my parents have a history with that. Also my Dad is like 50% similar to Denzels character.,5jutlo
dbj7r52,"I really liked this movie. It doesn't really do much beyond being a play on film (in terms of cinematography) but Denzel and Viola's performances were powerful enough to carry the film.

I really like this poster for the movie: http://i.imgur.com/JiGUBum.jpg

I love the way it DENZEL and VIOLA nearly as big as the title. After seeing the movie and looking at this poster it reminded me of a promotional flyer for a boxing match, and that kind of is a good metaphor for this movie. It's essentially Denzel and Viola acting at each other for 2 hours in a house. But it's absolutely stellar and compelling acting. The ""What law says I have to like you"" and ""I was standing with you"" monologues literally gave me chills. Highly recommend this film to anyone that appreciates good acting or finely crafted stories.",5jutlo
dbkanwo,Denzel and Viola put on an acting clinic with this movie.,5jutlo
dbmhk2a," I watched it today with my family. It is an amazing and powerful movie - I felt it all the way down in my soul. Now I want to read August Wilson's other plays. 

Denzel's character reminded me on my great uncles, grandpa, and other older black men in my family who lived in that era where the burdens of race, hatred, and poverty weighed down on them. 

I come from a family of sharecropper's in the Deep South and related to the themes of this movie based on the stories my dad and grandparents would tell me.

I could not recommend this film more! ",5jutlo
dbm6prk,"I've scrolled through an entire page of comments and almost everyone is giving Denzel Washington and Viola Davis high praise for their performances. Some mentioning that it's cinematically uninteresting and too stagey. Not a single mention of the actual story, whether good or bad.",5jutlo
dbmcjth,[deleted],5jutlo
dbrwb05,"I agree that that was the point of the movie, but I don't agree with it. You don't need a dick Dad to become your own man. You don't need a cheating husband to give you a child. The movie excuses all these terrible things that he did and says ""Hey, he was an asshole, but at least it lead to ""good"" things, right?""

I don't like the idea of him dying and not truly realizing the extant of how badly he hurt the people around him. The people that he ""loved"". There's the great scene with Viola Davis yelling at him, then there's the great scene of Denzel's friend basically leaving him, but we don't get that final confrontation of the Son sticking it to his Dad. Instead the Son leaves, essentially letting him win. Denzel's able to continue living his life guilt free essentially. If he's remorseful, we never really see it.",5jutlo
dbmtaqm,Viola Davis carried that movie. Best actress worthy. Even up against Portman.,5jutlo
ddkxvx6,"I really liked how the story covered certain issues like racism and sexism in less overt ways- showing, not telling, how the harsh reality of social issues impacted every day life at that time. In particular, Rose's monologue (""I been right here with you!"") spoke not only to the sacrifice of marriage in general but actually forced the audience, like Troy, to realize that there just wasn't any consideration of a woman's dreams or desires (above and beyond marriage). You're thinking of the story, the struggle, from Troy's perspective, his lament of his great unfulfilled potential as a result of poverty and marginalization until you're forced to see that, even though Rose bears the same burdens, her personal tragedy isn't as obvious because a woman's potential was simply not considered or valued. I think that Rose's enduring commitment and love made her a living reminder of Troy's 'soft' side and the primary reason that his children could forgive his flaws/failings.  ",5jutlo

dbkty6s,"its was an amazing film! so perfect, but why add the last five minutes!? ",5jutlo
dbsbbar,"This film was terrific. Personally, I would give it a 9.7 out of 10. Coming from a broken family that descends from broken families, this film resonated deep within me. The symbolism in the movie echoed with this sense of brokenness and yet wholeness from the father, Denzel.


For my own relationship with my father, I understand the fence that Denzel put up, it was a barrier. My father put up fences between himself and his children, yet instilling them with the best parts of him in the end, just like Viola Davis had said about Denzel.

Sure there were some rough parts, being an adaptation from the stage, but the quality brought out by all the actors in the movie were phenomenal and deserve praise. Overall a very solid film and one I won't soon forget.",5jutlo
de3oepu,Viola Davis gave the most emotionally devastating monologue I've ever heard. She is guaranteed Best Supporting Actress.,5jutlo
dbwypc3,Just saw it. My audience apparently didn't understand that it's not a comedy. So many amazing moments destroyed by obnoxious laughter. I'm fucking pissed.,5jutlo
ddcmxiq,"I could describe my experience watching this film but my big issue with it is this: Do you have to know before hand that the movie is an adaptation from a play? I mean, so you don't surprise yourself with almost two hours of pure dialog and little visual montage, editing or something that differs from a theatre act without the public.
I really liked the acting though, there is nothing to be said there but most of the movie experience is absent.",5jutlo

dcabg0n,"Saw this last night and thought it was phenomenal. Hooked from the very beginning - the rapid fire dialogue between Trey and Bono, the '50s feel of the photography. Loved the way it retained the feeling of a stage production but still managed to break free a bit from theatre restraints and feel relatively cinematic.  Amazing performances throughout, Denzel and Davis are a given, but was also really impressed by Williamson's work. Great film. ",5jutlo
ddceydr,"You can tell Denzel directed this movie, cause it's not much more than Denzel talking. ",5jutlo

",5jutlo
dbn1p84,"I thought the acting was great. Denzel, Viola, and the rest of the cast were very good. Most of them were in the 2010 broadway production. 

August Wilson is a brilliant playwright and Fences is his best, but it did not translate well to film. The pacing was awkward and slow, and Denzel's cinematic direction was odd. A lot of zooming on faces during emotional monologues and  tight shots in general. I thought the movie lost touch with some of the humor of the play. ",5jutlo
dc0pemk,4.5/5 This shit was too damn real for me as I related with the character of Korey. So that bought it up a notch. All around amazing performances also.,5jutlo
dcbknuv,Did anyone else notice that the fence wasn't complete when Troy was in the backyard after the bar scene with Bono?,5jutlo
dbmod6j,"This movie is excellent. It completely captures what it is to live. 

I honestly feel that this story could be whitewashed yet still be as powerful. It's about family. It's about struggle. But most importantly, it's about dreams and what happens when they don't quite come true. ",5jutlo
dbpxmo2,"I went because I was forced to not because I was dying to see the movie. Play style movies are just not my style and it dragged on way too long. The acting was impeccable however except for the rather bad ending. 

She only stayed with him after he cheated because she had nowhere to go and he made all the money for her. In that time period women made scraps if they so chose to work. The only option the son had when his dad kicked him out WAS to join the military or risk being homeless.",5jutlo
dbxhr4a,"Just got out of the theatre, loved it. I don't get all the hate, I think the dialogue was paced perfectly. There wasn't a moment I wasn't interested in what was gonna happen next. Definitely a powerful movie that stuck with me on the ride home.

I didn't know it was a play going into it and I don't think it really showed during the movie either. I think a lot of people commenting didn't watch the movie.",5jutlo
dbl3gug,"I have a hard time with this movie. I think I liked it or at least was entertained by it, but I can't help but think this just wasn't translated to screen well. It was just monologue after monologue and Denzel made the strange choice to zoom in on the actors face during every emotional monologue. It is really distracting looking at Viola Davis' round, sobbing face take up the whole screen. Also it felt like every monologue went on just a little too long which I think works in a play because they are playing to the audience but in a movie it just dragged some of the scenes.

The acting was good but the film was clearly a vehicle for those Oscar highlight reel moments so it almost felt cheap and unauthentic. I really liked Denzel in it for the most part but at the same time we watched him go on and on for so much of the movie it almost felt like his overall performance was saturated, I think less could have been more.

A great point of reference to show they should have cleaned up the play a bit to put on screen (which to be fair may have been out of the question) was the last scene when they are singing the song. It just sort of dragged, felt really forced, and again the camera was zoomed uncomfortably close to the actors. That scene actually got laughs from the audience I saw it with. I'm just surprised Washington saw how that last scene played out on film and didn't decide to clean it up a bit.",5jutlo
dd2wzwk,"Enjoyed this movie, you could tell it was adapted from a play with how character driven the story was. A family drama that dealed with themes of responsibility, betrayal and death. I also liked the spiritual symbolism seen through gabe. ",5jutlo
ddx9qsc,I think this is the first 4 hour movie I ever watched.,5jutlo
dfa8ck4,"I just went in complete blind and thought it was pretty immersive for lack of a better word. The heavy presence of the father walking around the house felt real throughout the movie. Didnt know (or suspected) it was a play till I read about it later. I even thought they didnt show the woman he cheated with to keep the focus on the family situation like it was a take on black families in the 50s in general. Thought they did a really great job and gave me a lot of insights into what an impact the state of the world had on those families, like a deep rooted sadness into their genes. So much unfairness and supressed egos. The movie felt litteraly heavy, like a drag but in a good and realistic way. ",5jutlo

dbnozj7,"Once I knew it was adapted from a play, I went in with that mindset. So I expected the long monologues, and that it actually looks like a play onscreen...But even knowing that, it stretched a little too long for me. Still had its moments, but there were times where I got exhausted of Denzel's monologues. Overall, I liked it though.",5jutlo

dbrwf0e,"And if the Son was the protagonist, we should have had more scenes with him. That's another issue I had with the film, regardless of the ending. We just don't see enough of him and I don't fully understand him as a character, which wasn't the case with everyone else.",5jutlo
dbvpaia,"I thought this wasn't terrible but wasn't mind boggling. Acting,  script, and story wise I loved it, where it really lost me was visually. I do not at all mind diologue heavy scenes but the beginning scenes seemed a lot like Denzel Washington just focusing on his own character. The other characters were just there to agree with him and chew scenery. And visually, there was nothing interesting. Most of this movie was medium shots and the blocking didn't do anything. I would say 7/10. I love Denzel as an actor (speaking of which, Viola Davis and the other actors kill in this movie) but he shouldn't direct in my opinion",5jutlo
dbyklmj,"This movie bothered the heck out of me. Let me rephrase that. The *ending* bothered the heck out of me. I have literally seen no other film have such an issue with character identity/moral compass. They spent the entire film developing Denzel to be a complete jerk (cheating? and then saying he's going to keep doing it?) and then at the end everyone was just like ""meh, he did his best, let's go to a funeral."" Also, his son's character development was laughably nonexistent. It bothers me because the movie had a lot of good to go along with that, but those were fatal flaws.",5jutlo

dbluzyh,"Just got finished seeing it. Spent a $25 fandango gift card on 3 of us and I'd like to say it was not worth the money. I was very hopeful going into it but after the first hour I just couldn't find anything I loved about it. The acting was good, but it was just tons of monologue. 
Was it just my theater or did anyone else's have at least 8 people howling after every part that wasn't remotely funny. I thought it was a comedy at one point because of the amount of laughing throughout the movie. 
Maybe I'm bitter because of the experience but I definitely did not enjoy it. ",5jutlo
dbpw4kw,"I'm really surprised that I didn't like this. I just don't think the pace translated well to film. There were 2 different times where it felt like the movie was ending. I hate it when that happens and it shows a real problem with pacing.

I'd say the pace was hurt by its play-like monologues. I understand that it's an adaption from a play, but it can't be such a direct adaption. Talking into a camera is awkward compared to talking to an audience. When Denzel was talking to the camera while holding the bat in his final scene I rolled my eyes because it seemed so corny.

The ending left a sour taste in my mouth. I was happy for Corey to finally stand up to his dad, who was truly a bad guy. Then, after he leaves, he's singing his song and looking up at the heavens smiling. I feel like a bad guy got off easy. There was nothing redeemable about his character to me. He didn't love anyone in his family and was an unapologetic cheater. It's fine to have a main character like that if he is treated like such, but Gabe blew his horn and let him into heaven. I really despised the main character and seeing everyone love him at the end upset me.

The acting was phenomenal from everyone, though. No denying that. It's a joke if Viola Davis gets Best Supporting Actress though, as she was clearly not a supporting character.",5jutlo

df30q21,"Fences is about today's black people. It is sad, depressing , but so right in how blacks play the victim. Denzel had a dream but the world was harsh so he held a grudge. The grudge became his identity. His wife would support him but realized he is playing a victim. As the lead gets old he fights death n pushes everyone away. Very depressing and explains why blacks from lower to middle class snap at life",5jutlo
dbo1up5,"Having never seen or read the play, I really liked the movie.  It definitely felt like some scenes and dialouge were dragged out a bit (ehm....looking at you Denzel). 

And I guess my biggest gripe was that the audience I watched it with was majority black (I am also), but my goodness were they uncultured. During Gabes scenes, half of the packed theater would be cracking jokes at him and laughing. The worst was during the big scene with Viola where people literally talked and laughed through the whole thing, to the point I had to yell ""can you Shut up""

That being said, however, my mother and I both started crying from laughter at the final scene where Gabriel is playing his horn. Having no idea how the story went in the play, we both expected him to play taps or some sort of beautiful song only to be greeted with his character running out of breath staring at the sky while several characters looked up with fond memories of a man who had done nothing but spit in the face of all of their hard work and love for their entire lives. We both agreed that we felt morally wrong for laughing at the scene, but it was impossible for either of us to hold back.

df31ho3,"Sad part is a lot of young ones or even adults will see Denzel's character as dominant even though he was negative. On the inside Denzel was weak. He was falling apart. People laughing at the theater don't realize that most people who build prison around themselves so life doesn't hurt them anymore end up like Denzel's character.

To me, the purpose of the adaptation was to introduce the story to audiences who wouldn't or haven't seen the stage version.

",5jutlo
dceswxy,"Dude, that's the most interesting/unique part. Honestly, the thing I was most curious about going into the movie was how they would handle the ending.

The original stage directions read...
""*(Gabriel, with great fanfare, braces himself to blow. The trumpet is without a mouthpiece. He puts the end of it into his mouth and blows with great force, like a man who has been waiting some twenty-odd years for this single moment. No sound comes out of the trumpet. He braces himself and blows again with the same result. A third time he blows. There is a weight of impossible description that falls away and leaves him bare and exposed to a frightful realization. It is a trauma that a sane and normal mind would be unable to withstand. He begins to dance. A slow, strange dance, eerie and life-giving. A dance of atavistic signature and ritual. LYONS attempts to embrace him. GABRIEL pushes LYONS away. He begins to howl in what is an attempt at song, or perhaps a song turning back into itself in an attempt at speech. He finishes his dance and the gates of heaven stand open as wide as God's closet.)*""

All things considered, they handled it in a pretty tame way. Seems like August Wilson wanted to put something in to make certain that all performances/interpretations would be slightly different.

He wanted the best for his son and for him that meant getting him into a trade. I totally understand that. 

as for the affair, he never looked at another woman for 15 years and when he did have a child out of wedlock, he didn't shirk his responsibilities. He still came home every night . He still gave his wife his paycheck and lived on what she gave him. If you want to condemn everyone who had an affair, you'd have a long list.

the denzel character was flawed for sure, but at heart a decent man. He had a hard life, was denied his life. The line at the end, where the son learns that, when he played baseball, 200 people lined up to shake his hand tells the tale of this man and who he was. But he had to live the life of a garbage man . That was the reason he fought his son on going into sports, he understood more than anyone, the ultimate pain of that decision.  ""get yourself a trade. Something they CAN'T TAKE AWAY FROM YOU.'"" 

The son needed, like every son/father relationship, to be his own man, but to eventually learn the sacrifices his father went through to get him there. the denzel character never beat his wife, always gave his paycheck to his wife, and always came home.

de3v9ms,"I wasn't a big fan of the ending really, but I think the message they were trying to send were that, when it comes to someone being a good or bad person/father, things aren't always black and white.

Troy was definitely a piece of shit, but at the same time, look at his life.  His father tried to rape his first girlfriend (a 13 year old) and was way more abusive than him.  Not like that excuses his actions, but I think Troy realized he wasn't the greatest guy and tried (to some extent) to raise Corey be a better man than him - just like he was a better man than his father.  For example, in the story Troy was telling about him fighting off his dad during the attempted rape, he was beaten so bad that both of his eyes were swollen shut.  Then later, when Corey gets into a scuffle with Troy, Troy backs off before actually injuring him.  I think he even said to Rose at one point that he wanted Corey to be better than him.  

Rose tells Corey at the end that Troy tried to ""make you everything he was, and also everything he wasn't,"" and I think when Corey sang the Ol' Blue song he realized that there was at least some good in his father.

Everything I had, my education, my clothes, my hobbies was due to my parents, but my father made sure I never took any of it for granted and knew where the excess came from and what was sacrificed for my growth and happiness. 

He made sure I knew the world would not be kind to me and to learn to rely on myself for the things I wanted and to take responsibility for the mistakes I made. Both my father and Troy have these antiquated views on being black in the modern world, but they both did what they did to make sure we never had to face the troubles they did in their youth. 

My mother (neither black nor American) showered me with affection much like Rose. She let me explore and be artistic, but she also let me be a brat and covered up my mistakes. She swept the problems under the rug and never faced them head on. 

All this to say that there's nothing that occurs in this film that indicates to me that Troy didn't want Cory.

A lot of people grow up with the image of the world being black and white. You get married have kids and happily ever after. They don't tell you about temptations like Troy cheating on Rose. Why do we always sugarcoat everything. So when someone else comes along and faces that situation. Well hmm I know it's bad if I cheat but I've done so much for my family I deserve this like my dad did and everything ended up okay. Now the cycle is repeating itself.",5jutlo

Rose calls him out on the bit about the league being racist and it was really about him being too old. The white man let him drive a garbage truck.

dc00ni2,"uhm, yes he beat his children. we even see it in the movie. no, he didn't go home every night, we saw that in the movie. no, he drank more than fridays after work, we saw that in the movie.   

the son he raised was ""respected"" because he went to the military for 7 years, not because he respected his father - in fact the violent climax between then was based on his disrespect.   

lol @ never abandoned his responsibilities. what about the responsibility of being a faithful husband? what about being a sympathetic human being? what about understanding the happiness and dreams of others instead of focusing on your own failures? at what point does emotional support and compassion become a responsibility? at what point does ""okay, you have food on the table"" become the sole responsibility a father has?  

he was a shitty person, a trash father, and he damaged everyone around him",5jutlo
dbzssuf,"> He never once abandoned his responsibilities, never once hit his wife or beat his children, come home every night, never gambled away or drank away his money. He only drank on fridays after work. The son he raised ended up to be a respected man.

When people talk about applauding people for the bare minimum, this is what they mean. 

The fact that you genuinely responded to OP stating ""He was manipulative, brutal, dishonest, thrived off of dominating others, and scapegoating all his problems"" with ""well, at least he was there and he didn't physically hurt them"" is wrong. Hell, you make him sound like my dad, right down to taking credit for his son's eventual success, when it was more in spite of him than because of it (which, ironically, sounds like his dad...and my grandpa's dad...and so on)

dc0122x,"> uhm, yes he beat his children. we even see it in the movie

No, he disarmed a child that took a bat to him. He didn't hit him, Once he had taken the bat away, he didn't touch him . Remember HIS father in a similar situation beat him to a pulp. 

And no, his son became a success because the father prevented him from wasting his life on a dream that the father thought would bring him ultimate pain. 

And I hate to break it to you: parents aren't perfect humans: they make mistakes . The value of a man is what does a man do when he has made a mistake: the Denzel character confessed and did not shirk from his responsibilities. ",5jutlo

dc01nb8,"okay, I'm about through with this conversation. you question my age, but I question whether or not you've even seen the movie.  

the son blatantly says ""you can't whoop me no more"" implying that his father is abusive. after that, the father grabs him by the back of the head and throws him to the ground. when the boy gets up, the father hits him across the face. AFTER THAT the boy gets the bat.  

> And no, his son became a success because the father prevented him from wasting his life on a dream that the father thought would bring him ultimate pain.  

LOL! the father isn't the one who gets to determine whose life is wasted and on what. that is the entire point of the fucking movie. the father restricted his wife's ambitions and dreams. he restricted his son's, too, and then would designate what is best for them only because he lucked into his house which they live in. NOBODY, least of all the father with his backwards ass view of the world, can say the son's life would have been wasted at college.  

> the Denzel character confessed and did not shirk from his responsibilities.  

yes, he did. 
",5jutlo
dbzvy1l,"How do you go from relating to Denzel's character because you're also a father (and assumedly act in similar ways) to implying my opinion is irrelevant because I relate him to my father? 

Yeah, yeah, it's art, so we can interpret it in all kinds of ways. But it's a very strange interpretation, to ignore all the negative traits written into the character and instead focus on the fact that his children weren't starving and he didn't beat his wife. ",5jutlo
dbq9u6k,"Haha, what does my username have to do with this? Please refrain from posting in these discussion threads in the future if you continue to bring nothing to the table that is worth discussing. ",5jutlo
dc02pjj,The son disrespected his father in his own house. You don't do that. ,5jutlo
dbzzsrw,"What exactly did you think he did wrong. He cheated on his wife once in 15 years and paid the price, but if every parent who had an affair was horrible, there would be very few good parents. 

He didn't beat his children. He fed and clothed them. He never beat his wife, he came home every night and he took care of all his responsibilities. His child succeeded in life. 

Hate to break it to you, he doesn't owe them anything other than that. ",5jutlo

ddkpblk,My God. He had another child and basically forced his wife to look after her because he had work every day. How in any way does his wife deserve that?,5jutlo
dc01rlk,">he doesn't owe them anything other than that.

So again, we're back to good-equals-doing-the-bare-minimum thing. You're really using the fact that his wife wasn't beat and his kids aren't dead as evidence that he was a good man, father, etc and that is very telling.

I'd discuss how he's verbally abusive and the poster boy for manipulative, but you clearly have such a drastically different idea of what qualifies a person to be ""good"" that I genuinely think we'd both be wasting our time.",5jutlo
