h2a6y25,Ercole broke the lame disney streak of hidden villains by being a dick and just getting *worse* as the movie went on lol,o34eyh
h2azwwk,"I was waiting the whole movie for some tragic backstory to explain why Ercole is the way he is. 

Turns out he‚Äôs just a dick and I much prefer that",o34eyh
h2apxdj,When Luca gets pulled out of the water and Alberto asks him ‚ÄúFirst time?‚Äù and Luca relies ‚ÄúOf Course it is! I‚Äôm a good kiiiiiid üò©‚Äù that was the cutest shit ever lol,o34eyh
h2acclv,"So what's a guy gotta do to get a recipe for trenette a pesto? man, those basil leaves and little mozzarella balls were just gorgeous",o34eyh
h2adq1z,"Loved it. Just so Lowe stakes.
The dad was this amazing character. He was such a softy. They kinda showed it where he said like ""nah I was born this way""",o34eyh
h2a3u3u,I loved this movie. From then light hearted but meaningful storyline to the amazingly beautiful animation. People always want the next Soul or Inside Out but movies like Luca are just as good.,o34eyh
h2a4gl2,"So I'm pretty sure Bruno is Alberto's dad's name, right?",o34eyh
h2clwgb,"I‚Äôm starting an Easter egg thread.  

Film nerd stuff:

- Posters in the background are visible for Roman Holiday (1953), La Strada (1954), and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954).

- When Luca and Julia are going over the roofs to the telescope, there‚Äôs a TV briefly playing Italian caper film ‚ÄúA Big Deal on Madonna Street‚Äù (1958).

- The first boat we see is the Gelsomina, named after one of the main characters in ‚ÄúLa Strada.‚Äù  Masimo‚Äôs boat is the Elena, maybe a ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù reference.

- The photo stuck to the Vespa handle is of 
Italian movie star Marcello Mastroianni.  Looks like it might be from when he did ‚ÄúDivorce, Italian Style‚Äù due to the moustache.

- I think it‚Äôs been confirmed that the town name 
Portorosso is a reference to Studio Ghibli‚Äôs ‚Äú Porco Rosso‚Äù which also takes place on the Italian coast.  The credits sequence with sketches showing everyone‚Äôs future adventures is used in a lot of Ghibli films like ‚Äú My Neighbor Totoro‚Äù and ‚Äú Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service.‚Äù",o34eyh
h29uo2q,Why does Maya Rudolph play the mom in every animated movie and why does it catch me off guard every time?,o34eyh
h29ut07,The bully kid looked like a young Chef Skinner from *Ratatouille*.,o34eyh
h2bgmom,"I really \*loved\* the ending. I thought it was nice that Alberto stayed behind with the dad (after having lost his own father), and didn't follow Luca and Giulia. Every character got their own happy ending.",o34eyh
h2biy16,This movie told the story about redemption and forgiveness that Raya and the Last Dragon wanted to tell.,o34eyh
h29vh13,"I love that the Pixar movies just always seem to be getting more beautiful looking. The city setting itself was just so alive and fun, but I was blown away by the first island and how the scenery looked. This met my expectations and then some.",o34eyh
h2aagmg,"Part of me thought the antagonist's fate was gonna be him accidentally stabbing himself with the harpoon, especially with the way he started surfing on the bike",o34eyh
h2a1hte,This felt very emotional as an Italian to watch. It's not as big of a movie as some of the known masterpieces from Pixar but I loved it nonetheless.,o34eyh
h2cy0na,‚ÄúMade in our slippers in various parts of the Bay Area‚Äù,o34eyh
h2a7024,My name is Luca. I live on the ocean floor...,o34eyh
h2a6ibj,The Italian is so aggressive in this movie that it needs Giorno‚Äôs theme,o34eyh
h2cwzm6,"There seems to be a narrative going around that its one of Pixar‚Äôs weaker fare on the level of Good Dinosaur and maybe part of that is because it went straight to Disney+.

But I have to say I did not find that to be the case. Perhaps my expectations were lowered because of the discussion surrounding the film but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Sure the stakes are lower and its not pushing any boundaries creatively like Inside Out or Soul but its much closer to Pixar‚Äôs usual quality than something like Good Dinosaur.

The lighthearted, warm kids story with a strong message worked really well and the smaller scale and stakes made it much more relatable and whimsical to me.

Some of the comparisons to Call Me By Your Name are fair but to its strength I think.

I definitely recommend checking it out to those on the fence.",o34eyh
h2a2aas,"‚ÄúSome people, they will never accept him, but some will. And he seems to know how to find the good ones.‚Äù That hit me HARD",o34eyh
h2bl949,"Loved it.

Felt it was subtle, but Julias fathers acceptance of the boys wasn't just ""I like her friends"". He had one arm not because of a sea monster, that's just the way that he was born. Same thing. Luca and Alberto were born that way, so what? 

My kid ranked it an 8/10, which is a pretty high score from him.",o34eyh
h29whvu,I appreciated how lighthearted and enjoyable this film was. Sure there was a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù but it was very straightforward and plainly laid out. I liked that there was no complicated twist or unexpected villains like many animated films. It was just a easy-going enjoyable film.,o34eyh
h2ahqd7,Best Vespa commercial of all time.,o34eyh
h2asrpo,"I love, love, love this movie. When I first saw the trailer for it a month or two ago, at first I dismissed it as being something forgettable and silly. But within‚Äô the last few weeks as more trailers came out, suddenly I was super excited to see it. Was counting down the days until today, and I really enjoyed it. The animation was adorable, and I loved the story and characters. I really liked Alberto, he was hiding so much loneliness and insecurity behind that confident demeanor. This is my favorite to come out of Pixar in a long long time!",o34eyh
h29z3jv,At this point Pixar is just straight flexing their animation being the best there is.,o34eyh
h2cy1cp,"We named our baby boy born last year Luca and soon after his birth this film was announced. It lived up to our expectations in every sense, beautiful film and very original.",o34eyh
h2bshqw,"I really enjoyed this movie. Like others pointed out it was light hearted and fun. But I also really enjoyed Massimo's small arc. When Alberto didn't return and he went out looking for him ""just in case"", that hit me good. And when he said I made your favourite, for me, he wasn't even talking to his daughter, it was Alberto's favourite.",o34eyh
h29w3fw,[deleted],o34eyh
h2a05cb,"Loved this movie, was everything i wanted from it and more. Loved the characters and the town, and i loved how simple and slice of life it was. The animation and colors in this films were beautiful and i hope to see pixar branch out more with their animation styles. Luca calling Alberto a sea monster genuinely shocked me and i felt just as hurt as alberto in that scene.

One of the only complaints i have is the parents seemingly trying to out their child trying to find him?

But yeah, i know there are far deeper and complex pixar films out there, but i just felt so much joy watching this and it‚Äôs up there as one of my favorite pixar films.",o34eyh
h2hiojx,"the last 10 minutes of this movie, specifically the last 5.... hit me like a bag of bricks. the way my tears started POURING.... this movie started okay, then got good, then became great. 

pixar, you fuckers did it again.",o34eyh
h29v3eu,"The animation style reminded me a lot of the Popeye era of cartoons.  It was a very charming movie, though pretty predictable with some of the plot turns.  Some of the shots were beautiful!",o34eyh

- Everybody after watching this movie",o34eyh
h2a03pz,"If you didn't know, Sacha Baron Cohen voiced the uncle sea monster and there was an end credits scene related to him. 

I really liked the part when the mom got distracted with the movie poster and was wondering why her brother was on the poster.",o34eyh
h2akh5n,That was such a sweet movie,o34eyh
h29wsqx,"I really enjoyed ""silencio Bruno."" Teaching kids that they can silence their inner voice is a really important lesson.",o34eyh
h2cajhu,"Let's pray for everyone named Bruno having to hear ""Silenzio, Bruno!"" for the rest of the year",o34eyh
h2g0qe1,It‚Äôs such a crime that Disney didn‚Äôt want to release this into theaters.,o34eyh
h29xzsv,"I LOVED IT. I teared up when hearing Alberto‚Äôs papa abandoned him, it hit me hard. Luca is such a sweet character too!",o34eyh
h2b6262,"I thought it was extremely cute. Big smile on my face throughout, thanks to how light hearted the whole movie feels - which made some scenes towards the end extremely strong by contrast. All in all, loved it :D",o34eyh
h2meb3o,I like how they didn't make the chubby kid the one eating the pasta lol,o34eyh
h2cgouw,"When rewatching, I actaully started to sob during the ending where Luca was leaving on the train with Alberto saying goodbye. 

It's a very simple film but in all honesty, I think the simplicity is what makes it so special. It's a movie that perfectly captures that childhood ecstasy of lounging about in the summer with friends that are just as weird as you. And when the time comes to say goodbye, you can't help but feel sad that it's all coming to an end, but it's those memories that were shared together that really makes the experience all worth it. 

Fuck. This movie absolutely broke my heart. I miss being a kid, man.",o34eyh
h29w7ov,"Really really loved this. Super gorgeous with another great soundtrack, and like usual, had me sobbing by the end",o34eyh
h29z3oc,"Really good movie. Lovely animation and a great score. I liked the low stakes story and focus on character relationships. I suspect this will be unpopular but I also found the villain to be very entertaining.

I just wish the friendship between Luca and Alberto had been fleshed out a little bit more so the emotional moments towards the end hit harder. The betrayal after Alberto reveals himself was still a huge gut punch though. Terrific scene.",o34eyh
h2ancj5,"The ending scene where Luca asks Alberto ‚ÄúBut how will I know your okay?‚Äù and Alberto tears up and hugs him. Last time someone left, it was Alberto‚Äôs father, who never cared enough to come back. Meanwhile Luca just wants to know his friend will be okay. The feels.

Overall. I liked this movie. But I didn‚Äôt love it. It took me the first half our to really get into it. A lot of it felt clique and predictable. However it had some really nice moments in it. Massimo was such a sweet father to all of them. And I liked the relationship between Luca and Alberto.",o34eyh
h2almtj,"My one grip was how easily humans lost fear of sea creatures and became friends. It just didn‚Äôt add up.

Other than that it‚Äôs a good movie, loved the cat.",o34eyh
h29v11d,"People seem to always just compare all of these to other Pixar outings, and though it‚Äôs not up there with the best, it‚Äôs just fucking delightful. 

Massimo is my guy.",o34eyh
h2atamh,Had the pleasure of watching it in the cinema ‚Äúbefore anyone starts downvoting ‚Äî its showing in the cinema in my country‚Äù. It was fun and cute. My kids loved it a lot which is the most important thing lol. I thought the reveal about the gelato eating old ladies was funny and I didnt see it coming!,o34eyh
h2gqt60,"When Alberto said ""I'm just the kid that ruins everything"" - that hit me like a brick wall, I just started bawling.",o34eyh
h29wu3e,"It took a little bit to get into it, but I liked the more chill vibe it has compared to other pixar films.",o34eyh
h29w82g,Most parts of the movie had a very Ghibli movie vibe to it especially at the ending art stills sequence,o34eyh
h6mj535,"I believe the different relationships in Luca all had different drivers, but it‚Äôs hard not to see a romantic interest, but specifically on the part of Alberto, and not necessarily from Luca‚Äôs perspective. 

Both Luca and Alberto were interested in winning money for the Vespa - but the ultimate personal drivers were different. 
Luca was interested in his friendships with Alberto and Giulia, fascinated with learning about the world, and aching for adventure. He was reveling in self-discovery.
Alberto, while similarly excited in adventure, started to discover a different driver; Luca himself. 
When Alberto started to discover that Luca seemed equally interested in spending time with Giulia, he became jealous, continuously trying to impress Luca, and reaffirm their (his) dream. 
Winning the money to buy the Vespa lost its value for Alberto when he started to notice they‚Äôd be sharing the dream with Giulia (or worse, Luca abandoning the dream to go to school with Giulia instead) Even though the dream of owning a Vespa was Alberto‚Äôs to begin with, the thought of it not being just him and Luca pushed him to risk abandoning that dream by revealing himself to Giulia. 

I also want to note that the story didn‚Äôt end with overwhelming fulfillment for Alberto. I believe the writers purposefully left Alberto in a place that‚Äôs not neatly wrapped up; there was no playing-up of Alberto finding any fulfillment - more of a ‚Äúhe‚Äôs good for now.‚Äù This could potentially keep things open for a sequel. And boy do I hope there is one.


I think, as with a lot of Pixar films, there is a message baked in as simple as viewing the beautiful art and music, and the simple joys of friendship, imagination, and discovery - but there are often deeper stories that open up the heart of the human experience. The stories don‚Äôt rely on one or the other, and can be enjoyed as deep or as beautifully simple as the viewer wants to go.",o34eyh

h2a3qf6,I‚Äôm here for the Easter eggs.,o34eyh
h2bs31n,"This movie is pure, summertime joy. The best kind of joy that takes me back to the days of my childhood when the world seemed magical and I could soak in the simple pleasures of life. I loved it.",o34eyh
h3sldwz,"‚ÄúSome people, they will never accept him, but some will. And he seems to know how to find the good ones.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Great writing; it really portrays things in an optimistic way without sugarcoating reality.",o34eyh
h4rqifr,"even though it was a happy ending, it still felt sad, like the two boys will be apart long enough that when they meet again, they‚Äôll both be older and different people than if the three of them had gone to school together",o34eyh
h2bwm7d,"The end really reminded my of the end of ""The Body"" by Stephen King.  Luca was going off to school to explore his potential and try to better himself and that pursuit was destined to separate himself from Alberto.  This happens a lot in life.  Childhood friends don't share the same economic background, family dynamics or intellectual pursuits and this can eventually bring a friendship to an end but that doesn't erase the importance that friendship had in it's time.",o34eyh
h2aw5z1,"I loved it and I wish it had a theater release.  Although I did appreciate being at home for the ugly crying lol

Part of why I loved it so much was because it reminded me of ghibli but specifically miyazaki. The pacing, the magical realism, and the humanity of it.",o34eyh
hk5mkvx,Anyone else ever wonder if maybe Bruno was Alberto‚Äôs fathers name??? That‚Äôs why he tells him to shut up‚Ä¶.,o34eyh
hnjqk8k,"This is probably one of the few Pixar movies I actually want a sequel to because there‚Äôs actually things they can do with it

I also like how the villain wasn‚Äôt some guy with some sad backstory and that the stakes were relatively low. Soul was a good movie but you don‚Äôt need a deep lesson in every movie, nor do you need the villain to be some sort of guy trying to do the right thing in a way that‚Äôs different than the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù.

If they ever do a sequel I‚Äôd definitely want to get more backstory on Alberto because tbh that still feels a bit unresolved, personally I do think the movie felt a bit rushed it honestly felt like it was a 1 hour movie instead of 2 hours",o34eyh
h2a47zx,Luca looks like a baby Tom Holland,o34eyh
h2afo95,"I think Pixar has this sort of looming shadow behind them always where if they're not making another Finding Nemo, Incredibles or WALL-E they're wasting their time. I enjoyed having a lighter, more personal story like this and I think they used the setting and premise well for that. The animation is fucking gorgeous and although it can feel a little cliched at times it felt like the perfect summer fun movie. I really hope we get a sequel to this sometime, the ending perfectly sets up a return to this world to see how Luca and Alberto change and grow while they are apart.",o34eyh
h2fibvi,This movie felt like a love letter to Studio Ghibli.,o34eyh
h3f99f2,"My little brother  and his boyfriend (they're 12) were watching this film with me, and the joy on their faces when they saw Alberto and Luca was adorable. They screamed at me that it looked like them; they were so happy to finally have a film that represented them.",o34eyh
h3rfwds,Am I the only one who didn‚Äôt get the gay vibe?  I thought it was a cute friendship. And it was a nice break from romantic relationships. I‚Äôm gay myself.,o34eyh
h5th4ur,"It was pretty simple and story is basic, but this was really a ton of fun to watch. It just clicked with me and enjoyed every second of it.",o34eyh
h29w5yv,"Cute flick, just caught with with the kiddos. Beautiful animation, some good humor, and a cute overall message. Good little popcorn flick if you've got young kids.",o34eyh
h29um7o,"While it had some cliches that I didn't care for, I LOVED this movie overall. 

I love how Luca and Alberto's friendship developed and I love how the story progressed. 

I want to see more of the world and mythology, and I'd love to see the trio's relationship develop as they grow up. I think this is one of the few Disney/Pixar movies that is ripe for a sequel.",o34eyh
h29wbvt,"This was a solid movie.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs top 5 Pixar. But I enjoyed it. 

The whole ‚ÄúSanta (insert cheese)‚Äù was freaking hilarious",o34eyh
h2aqdju,What does Alberto say to Luca in Italian at the end as the train starts pulling away?,o34eyh
h2b7ma9,I really enjoyed this one. Wasn‚Äôt expecting to.,o34eyh
h409g9t,Loved the movie except when Alberto got revealed and Luca backed away and yelled ‚ÄúSea monster!‚Äù I immediately said woooooow what a dick.,o34eyh
h42efqo,"Liked it much better than Raya imo. It was simple but consistent while raya was exspansive and wildly inconsistent. . Also did the cultural part much better, maybe even overdid it leaning into parody at times. But that is still better than the cultural mish mush in Raya and ""asian"" cast from an entierly different part of Asia.",o34eyh
h29v3fz,I thought the end was fine.,o34eyh
h2arzy0,"Utter fucking bullshit this didn't come to theaters, or at least get a hybrid home/theater release. Besides Soul, this was one of the few gorgeous looking Pixar films that deserved to be seen on the big screen. Disney is so puzzling these days. Everything is wide open, most theaters are open, and Disney just dumps this for free. I read the animators behind Luca were not too thrilled with this decision. Anyways can't wait to watch this weekend, been hyped on this for over a year.",o34eyh
hs6zsyv,"I loved the film honestly, gave me Studio Ghibli vibes. It was slow-paced, but I loved it. It gave the characters time to breathe, I loved that there was no big bad, just an arrogant prick who's competing in a children's triathlon because he's an asshat. Luca, Alberto and Julia were all amazing as well. I was worried they'd all be very annoying, but they were excitable little kids and I loved them because they felt like actual children in that innocent moment before the teen years set in and they start to mature.",o34eyh
h69uszk,"Good movie. Nothing groundbreaking. Have it on the level of Soul, Raya, Onward, etc. Pixar hasn‚Äôt been able to recreate the magic of Toy Story, Wall-E, The Incredibles, or Ratatouille. But definitely worth watching.",o34eyh
h2voste,"To be fair to Alberto, I'd be pretty pissed if my friends went on rooftop stroll to go stargazing without me while I'm doing chores for the friend's parent. You can't wait like an hour for him?",o34eyh
h2abam9,"If anyone liked the vibes of the setting, visit Cinque Terre in Italy. Absolutely stunning to visit",o34eyh
h3daqaf,Alberto sounds so much like Sokka from avatar. I know it‚Äôs not the same voice actor but it sounds so similar.,o34eyh
h5n6cc0,"It‚Äôs a simple, cute story. Good message for younger kids. Not the type of animation that I would say that EVERYONE should watch, but we also need more lowkey movies like that for our smallest people",o34eyh
h4bphif,"Watched this movie with my mom and at the start, we both looked at each other and immediately agreed that we should watch it in Italian.

Best choice, I'd say. The Italian voice actors killed it all around, everyone worked fantastically. To us, it just didn't feel natural to have characters speak in English when the setting and everything about it is just straight up Italian. So, amazing casting and a beautiful movie. I held my tears hardcore but the ending broke me, so bittersweet in some ways.",o34eyh
hhmao0g,"Idk why but I just finished this movie and surprisingly it made me tear up a lot at the end. I'm a guy and not many movies I watched this year made me tear up. I think the thing that made me a bit emotional is remembering the times I and my friends had when we were in middle school, one of the best times of my life.",o34eyh
hmfizpo,"I must say I loved it. When we watched it together, it seemed simplistic and forgettable, but I did notice the soundtrack and how beautiful the landscapes are; I transported myself to Italy.

Then I watched it alone on my phone another night, in Italian. I was blown out by it, honestly. The whole experience was moving, I can't quite explain why. The ending didn't make me cry but it affected me emotionally so hard I kept thinking inworld for two days after watching the movie; the only movie that had that effect on me. I don't know if it reignited childhood memories, what my life could have been and isn't or whatever. The leap between bright, refreshing, good-vibes feeling emanating from the story, the setting, and the characters vs. myself, alone in the living room at 2am, coping with a depression slump for several years now was gigantic. In a sense it was scary; what I consider my depression episodes are a different kind of down, but that deserved another name. I've never cried myself to sleep before.Now more than a week after I'm avoiding the movie, the OST, and everything around it as much as possible, since I remember the plot and my head starts wandering about the characters, etc.; I don't want to return to the state I mentioned above.

This ended up being a review of me rather than of the movie, but I couldn't talk about it without elaborating.",o34eyh
h2ag9bv,"How wild would it have been if the post credits scene was the exact same, but instead of cutting back to the fish, it cut to Nemo and Marlin just listening to him",o34eyh
hclj4c7,"I'm really glad Ercole is a monster just because. There are too many plots where every villain needs an explanation or a backstory for their actions. It's absolutely not like that in real world and it's good to see that in animated movies.

I'm not an Italian, but I think ""Santa Mozzarella"" is too much. Stereotypes are annoying.",o34eyh
h2c4nm7,"I appreciate the different direction in character design - it felt like Pixar‚Äôs take on the ‚ÄúCalArts‚Äù style seen in Steven universe, gravity falls and others. Half circle chiclet teeth in a bean-shaped mouth",o34eyh
h4hesi6,"wait i got a question‚Ä¶ why does Luca wanna split up the team when Alberto left? He could have raced with Guilia, and she could have done the swimming portion!? then he wouldn‚Äôt have to swim? and they can still win the vespa for alberto? Someone pls explain üò©",o34eyh
hk9oc0i,So when Luca cries why doesn‚Äôt it turn to sea monster under his eyes üòÆ,o34eyh
h2ccdrs,The computer graphics were very impressive in this one. Not so much the characters or animation particularly but the scenery and objects and all the textures. Some were so detailed that they almost looked like stop motion objects.,o34eyh
h35o4gu,At the end Alberto says he is going to stay with Massimo because he thinks Massimo might need him. But it's just a tough guy act. It's really that *Alberto* needs Massimo. It's the closest he's had to having a dad around. That hit me hard when I realized. ü•∫,o34eyh

h69h6uj,I fell in love with Italian music because of the movie,o34eyh
h29vpdc,"I really liked this. I get what people are saying about the LGBTQIA+ coding and it‚Äôs definitely there in the sense that it‚Äôs a story about being an outsider and accepting yourself. It‚Äôs a very safe, very 21st century message of ‚Äúbeing different is good‚Äù without being specific (which I imagine frustrates people). The part with Massimo‚Äôs arm was phenomenal. Also the final song ‚ÄúGo find out for me‚Äù was the moment that got me emotionally. I hope everyone just really enjoys it and takes whatever message they want from the underdogs.",o34eyh
h2awrnp,"Bruh, that green shit that they were eating looks tasty as fuck! What‚Äôs the name of it?",o34eyh
h33fydg,"I really liked this one from Pixar. It has a good mix of humor such as the cat or Uncle Uggo and it still got to a tearjerking place by the end with the underdogs triumphing. Goes without saying a Pixar movie set in Italy is gorgeous.

From a metaphor perspective I see this as much about poor people as gay people. Luca and Alberto are going after an expensive item in the Vespa and the villain is a snob rather than a bigot. Alberto and Luca relationship is like a poor uneducated person from the streets being friends with someone he knows is bright enough to get a college degree but is afraid he'll end up too good for him. Luca by the end is like the kid from immigrant family who's first to go to college.",o34eyh
h2onwu9,I feel like Luca seems like low-stakes to the majority audience because most people have never had their lives endangered from being outed,o34eyh
h2em5c1,The whole town immediately not caring about sea monsters was about too big of a stretch lol. Pretty much exactly the solid lil movie i expected tho. Really like the human dad and the subtle nod at subverting expectations with his arm. Also the grandma sleeping was hilarious. And Maya Rudolph is great,o34eyh
h2pjhf0,"Why doesn't anyone care that Ercole cheats throughout the entire race?

I guess the olive oil on the swimming part might not be cheating.  But they definitely say you can't eat the pasta with your hand and he shoves the pasta in his partners mouth.  Then on the bike he kicks over his opponents bike.",o34eyh
h3cemug,"I loved how this was such a break from formula (finally!) for Pixar. I was getting really tired of: 1. Accident happens. 2. Two unlikely friends sets of on an adventure with a plan to fix everything. 3. ROADTRIP! 4a. Everything goes wrong 4b. Plot twist villain 5. Self sacrifice 6. Emotional pandering to make adults cry 7. Happy ending and small flash forward. 

Like, it was amazing to see them just stay more or less in one place? Have a little less linear storytelling and character development, while still having clear story beats and a natural plot progression. I didn‚Äôt feel tired of the film once which is rarer and rarer for me with Pixar (although they are still overall good).",o34eyh
heb2hcn,Something I kept thinking about the worldbuilding of this movie... exactly how closely related are the sea monsters to humans? Could it be that the ancestors of the seamonsters WERE human? or did they split off at a lower branch of the evolutionary tree?,o34eyh

h2xna63,"I loved this movie. Absolutely gorgeously beautiful, I love the use of only platonic friendships. There was no Luca getting together with giulia or anything like that. I also liked the subtle moments of alberto and Luca hugging each other when giulia was yelling about the cup. Based on my friendships guys dont really do touchy stuff since it‚Äôs frowned upon, the pressure of not being gay or whatever. But they showed physical affection in a purely platonic way and I really enjoyed that. Such a good movie. And there was no twist villain! Finally!",o34eyh
h4odrvh,"Now that I finished watching the movie, I can honestly see a sequel or maybe even a show based on Luca learning in school and facing the usual ""hiding I am a Sea Monster"" problem.

If anything the second movie could be Luca returning back, sharing what he has learned to his friend Alberto. They could also explain what happened to Alberto father and so on. They could also show the consequences of well ""sea monsters"" showing up in Italy.

A continuation of the movie is likely to happen with the good reviews and with the Director of Luca being optimistic of this happening. Let's hope that if it does happen that it doesn't fail because I genuinely liked the movie.",o34eyh

I really enjoyed the characters and animation. The story was fun, even if it was predictable and lacked some of th deeper and more emotional content we've come to expect from Pixar. I did feel like the ending was a bit rushed too, but overall still really enjoyed it. I'd give it a 7.5/10. Not every Pixar movie needs to be a Soul or Inside Out for me to enjoy it.",o34eyh
h3hz2mk,"But why is the principal cast primarily NOT Italian?

I think it would‚Äôve made more sense for him to stay with his family but he can stay in that town whenever he wants on the weekend with his grandma or something",o34eyh
h29xcpy,"Much like other people here, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best Pixar film I‚Äôve seen, plot/story-wise, but I am 100% confident when I say it‚Äôs easily my favorite visually. It‚Äôs beautiful! 

I wish the plot explored more of the strife between sea-monsters and humans. Maybe more lore of who they are/came from/why they transform.",o34eyh
h2ab22d,"Loved it. Endlessly enjoyable.

Lots of people are somehow mad that many are interpreting this as queer, usually with the question ‚Äúwhy does everything have to be gay, can‚Äôt we just have representation of strong platonic male friendships?‚Äù 

Well if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, feel free to watch:

-	Toy Story (all about Buzz and Woody‚Äôs enemies to friends arc, and Woody has a female love interest)
-	Monsters Inc (Mike and Sully are platonic BFFs and Mike has a female love interest)
-	Cars (McQueen and Mater form a friendship, McQueen and Doc form and father/son bond, and McQueen even gets a Hetero romance with Sally)
-	Ratatouille (interspecies male friendship between Linguine and Remy, and Linguine has a female love interest)
-	Up (Carl and Russel become chosen family)
-	The Good Dinosaur (Arlo and Spot are either friends or pet and owner idk)
-	Onward (the two elf brothers strengthen their friendship on their journey)

So there are seven (not counting any sequels)  Pixar films in which the **lead** character(s) have ‚Äúplatonic male friendships‚Äù in which they frequently show emotional vulnerability and even cry!

But the people asking for ‚Äúplatonic friendship representation‚Äù don‚Äôt actually care about it, it‚Äôs just something they can claim to want when really they‚Äôre just upset that **one** (out of 24) movie has people excited that they see a pretty clear LGBT+ metaphor. 

And I‚Äôm not sure where the idea comes from that gay people are just *everywhere*, despite Disney‚Äôs several ‚Äúfirst gay characters‚Äù that end up being in the background, you can take a look at the list of [every single LGBT+ character ever in an animated film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animated_films_with_LGBT_characters) and see that it is a very short list, largely populated by minor characters, with several non-mainstream films and quite a few stretches.

Anyway, I loved this film about two very close and affectionate boys who have a shared secret identity, living in a society where people would not accept them if they knew what they truly were, which features >!a scene of one boy being outed and having his boy friend turn on him to avoid being outed himself!< and another scene where >!two older and inseparable woman come out as their true selves once society accepts their true identity!< and the line >! ‚ÄúSome people, they will never accept him, but some will.

I was skeptical of the style from the promos but the movie is actually gorgeous, it felt like I was watching a moving painting. 

Sea monster Maya Rudolph kicking Italian kids into a fountain to get them wet was GOLD.

I wish Disney would just let them make a gay movie. Watching this felt like Pixar wanted to do it and this is the furthest they could push it.",o34eyh

h2ggods,"Thought this was ok. Not bad, but not particularly good.

Plot was on the basic side and didn't really amount to much along with stretching credubility.

Ultimately, it was a beautiful but shallow experience.",o34eyh

h2ajmfo,I'm not really sure what it was but the first half of this movie felt like a short that they tried to stretch into a feature length.  I wasn't really feeling it but the 2nd half or maybe the last 3rd of the movie still delivered.  I think I needed a little more conflict in the beginning; they emphasize how dangerous the humans are for the sea monsters but they never really show it.  The resolution at the end is good but felt a little unearned because they never really show or explain the hate for the sea monsters in the first place.,o34eyh
h2dz2eo,Slightly upset how this film scored even less than Onward on Douban. :( I thought it‚Äôs better. Oh well.,o34eyh
h2epwkz,"I really enjoyed the movie. Anyone else think it's somewhat disappointing that a movie which is hailed as an LGBTQ allegory leans so hard into the ""villain coded as homosexual"" trope? Ercole was funny but damn, his antics made me cringe sometimes, especially contrasted against the traditionally masculine good adult male characters.",o34eyh
h2he6em,"I enjoyed it, but I felt like I would have rather watched the story from almost any other character's perspective. Luca's journey was the least interesting thing about the movie to me, and it started out so slow, using common tropes we've seen before.

I do appreciate a straight-forward story though when it's well made. I can see kids re-watching this over and over again.",o34eyh

h4kjp94,"loved it more than i thought i would. before watching it, it did remind me of Aardman's style, but actually watching it the design is uniquely it's own thing. the design was charming and beautiful and essential to the story. it was refreshing to see compared to the pixar films that came before. it was nice to see the coming of age child/parent relationship that didn't make me deeply sad.",o34eyh
h2jwcrh,"Luca impresed me so much when I watched it with my kids this weekend. It might be my new favourite Disney movie. 

For starters, I really like the scale/scope of the film. It doesn't tell of a world-ending catastrophe or gods or anything like that. Not all Disney films do, but still the story and stakes were small and I like that. It's a simple story about a couple of kids trying to figure themselves and each other out. That's it. What little supernatural/magical stuff there is just a backdrop for a very personal story.

The humor is subtle but really effective. I was surprised how much my 3-7 year old kids were laughing because it wasn't over the top slapstick but character based gags.

The style was really beautiful. It had almost a ghibli-esque aspect to it while still being unique. Speaking of Ghibli, this film reminded me a lot of Kiki's Delivery Service which is my favourite ghibli film. There's some supernatural elements but only as a backdrop to a simple coming of age story.

In a lot of ways this movie is very humble. It's not trying to out-do any of the previous Disney films with huge Hollywood voice talent or over the top musical numbers. It doesn't have the horrible recent animation trends of needlessly inserting pop music over montages or making already dated pop culture references. It's like a slice of time in this world that we're observing. There's no scenes I wish I could cut out, and no scenes I could think of to add. It's just as short/long as it needs to be.

Luca is very un-Disney in some ways. There's no musical numbers, no princesses or royalty, no heroes or villains (just some kids and a big jerk), and barely any animal sidekicks. Maybe that's on purpose. There is a moral to this story but it's open to interpretation and doesn't come to conclusions for the viewer. Everyone is able to read whatever they want from the ending which I found super cool. I love films that end in a way where you can imagine this world continuing to exist even after shutting the TV off. Other Disney films with a ""they lived happily ever after, the end"" don't have that same kind of magic to it.

I know I'm gushing a bit but I had to put down my thoughts on this. It's not often you discover new favourites this far along in your life. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts, positive or negative.",o34eyh
h2apwug,"Loved this film, a little weird seeing people debating if the movie had LGBTQ+ themes or not, it was pretty obvious and deliberate to me but oh well.

Story had a lot of Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo undertones until they get to the town and was pleasantly surprised of how they handled it. Very Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service with a 21st century message.",o34eyh
h2rn7ni,"Okay, I initially thought this was charming but I've changed my mind now, Luca is of the best things Pixar ever made. It's so good I already watched it 3 times.

h2adoem,"Sorry this is going to be long so bear with me. I wrote this all down after I watched the film lol. 

I really enjoyed this film! I didn't know anything about it except that the main character was also a mermaid (merman? Lol) of some sort so I went in knowing nothing. 

The film was drop dead gorgeous! The animation literally made me say ""Wow"" out loud a couple of times. It's a charming little town brimming with vibrant colors and locales. I enjoyed the music/score so much in this movie. 

The friendships and the way Luca, Alberto, and Giulia interact felt so true to life and adolescence. I don't think the film is necessarily super deep or anything but it plays those emotions well. When you see your best friend start to get close or maybe even closer than you are to someone else you get so jealous. When Luca gives up Alberto by calling him a sea monster it's like that Simpsons episode where Lisa humiliates Ralph on live TV ""You can pinpoint the second his heart rips in half"" lmao. And Alberto already has abandonment issues from his father as well. 

I did have a few issues with the film. I didn't love Luca's parents and I thought they could have had a better backstory or more to do besides worry about Luca and try to find him. I mean there's some amusing bits when they try to figure out a way to tell which child is Luca but they should've given them a backstory as to why they were so strict with Luca and not wanting him to go to the surface. For example, I remember reading for the making of Finding Nemo they actually didn't have that scene of Nemo's mother's death as the first scene and it just opened with Marlin and Nemo going on their first day of school. Pixar said the film just wasn't working because people found Marlin annoying. But by placing that scene of his wife's death at the beginning it contextualizes his character's neuroses and how paranoid he is about safety. In Luca this is basically what the parents are except we don't get any background on them and their only reason to try to keep Luca from above ground is to stay safe which is not very compelling or interesting. The sea people also could've used some more world building or explanation for what they are and why they turn to humans when out of water. 

The main villain is a huge jerk just to be a huge jerk and have someone to root against. He didn't really feel all that necessary and his comeuppance was not satisfying at all when they threw him in the fountain. So he was upset about getting wet in the fountain when he was already soaking wet from the rain? So weird. 

The reveal and aftermath of what Luca and Alberto are was puzzling. One second the entire town is blood thirsty and wants to catch them and then because Giulia's dad says he knows them and names them everyone backs off and then celebrates their win? That was Karate Kid-esque lol like when Daniel beats the Cobra Kai at the end and just before that they almost literally want to kill him but after Daniel wins Johnny gets the trophy and is like here you go man congrats! What?? Lol it just feels weird that a town would find out sea creatures exist and then at the end just shrug and walk off like it was no big deal. 

In contrast to how uninteresting Luca's parents were is Giulia's father who with so little screen time steals the show in a subtle way every time he's on screen. He looks like a big scary guy with one arm but actually is quite empathetic and a great father. The scene where he finds out Alberto is missing and Luca says he doesn't think Alberto wants anyone to look for him and the father goes out into the night to look for him anyways ""Just in case"" Thought that was so touching! And then he mentions he came into the world without his arm and you understand why he has so much heart and empathy for others. 

I think most of the big story beats worked for me. Alberto talking about how his father abandoned him and how he eventually just stopped counting the days (very Force Awakens Rey-like lol). Alberto protecting Luca from the rain and then Luca saving Alberto. Luca getting to go to school with Giulia and then leaving Alberto at the train station. I didn't cry or tear up during these moments or anything but they hit well for me. 

I know it seems like I complained a lot more than praised it lol but I really did enjoy this movie a lot! I don't need every film to have end of the world stakes or an intricate story. Sometimes a well told handsomely made animated movie can hit the spot and this did for me. It's a cute little slice of life film with a bit of supernatural flavor thrown in.",o34eyh

h8wh08x,"Forgettable film. The aesthetic, soundtrack, cat and fish scenes were nice, but the rest was meh. 

The characters felt unreal, I can't believe the conflict resorted to school vs ride a bike forever. I get that they're kids but the execution of exploring freely without a worry (Vespa biking forever) vs going on a purposeful journey (getting an education to learn about the world) felt like such a forced development when it got there, let alone using it to make the boys angry at each other. 

Alberto's development fell flat and Luca himself wasn't anything new. I could not get on board with the two main boys' chemistry no matter how many scenes we see them riding a bike. The parents were the typical buffoon dad and overbearing mom, both who can't do much to be useful in the film. These two never gave their son a proper explanation to why he shouldn't go up, it started with the fear mongering trope and then ending the movie with the ""I forgive you and love you"" trope. Nemo did it way better.

If mom and dad appeared on the surface for the first time (we look hideous!), how'd they manage to walk so skillfully while it took Luca some time? This was dumb.

Finally, the ending felt rushed. The race ended in a predictable way and the whole town gives up their differences over the sea monsters because the big burly dad taunted them down. Lazy.",o34eyh
h2fiz2x,"Gorgeous and charming movie. 10/10 for me.

Despite having some serious lgbt undertones, I interpreted as a big metaphor for immigrants coming into Italy.

Literally ""monsters"" (but actually just kids) coming from the sea, trying to blend in. Language barriers, prejudice, bullism from other kids (""we don't want people like you in this town. You smell"").

But also acceptance and the struggles to achieve the Italian (western) dream. To buy a vespa.

In the end Luca just wanted to join a school, like so many immigrant children.


Interesting how not a single comment here saw it like this.",o34eyh
h2ljmr9,"They‚Äôre gay, right?",o34eyh
h2a9t87,"I thought it was wonderful.

It wasn't as emotionally complex as some previous Pixar films, nor did it rip my heart to pieces like some of their best, but as I sit here thinking about it I can't think of a single thing wrong with it, or a thing I would change.

There were a few little things in the first half that I was less than crazy about, but as the movie progressed those things were all paid off in the climax. I was initially worried that too much time would be spent going back to the parents, making them a fully-featured subplot. Instead they were basically background gags and never detracted from the story. I was also worried too much time would be devoted to the conflict between Luca and Alberto, but the film very quickly got to the heart of the problem and built on it instead of spinning its wheels with drama for drama's sake.

If I wanted I could hold it up to Pixar's greatest hits and then shrug and say the movie failed to live up to what came before, but why do that? This movie is its own thing and what it was was charming, sweet, easy-breezy, frequently funny, and a great tribute to the power of friendship.

I suppose, if I had to pick any nits it would be with the character design in the animation. They seemed out of place compared to the mostly realistic environments. I suppose it was a necessary compromise considering the need to switch seamlessly between a human model and a ""fish monster"" model; they started with the fish monster and made a human version out of it, whereas if they had started with a more realistic human, the fish monster would probably have been too grim to work in such a light-hearted tale. Still, the characters looked underdone, in the Illumination-style. Occasionally there would be a shot or two that looked almost like they were 3D-animated versions of claymation figures and that would have been a cool style to build a whole movie around, but those moments were few and for the most part the character designs just looked like generic 3D animated models.

That being said, the visuals overall were stellar; Pixar didn't break any new ground so far as I could tell (such as with water animation when they developed Finding Nemo, or hair/fur when they made Monsters Inc), but they've got the ability to craft a world that's so well done it looks almost effortless. There were a couple genuinely beautifully shots, such as one where Luca and Giulia cross run over a rooftop at night, crossing in front of the moon, or the surreal shot of Luca skipping over the rings of Saturn. Those were fleeting moments of jaw dropping animation and style, but the rest of the film felt like a great studio operating on cruise control.

Again, it sounds like I'm bashing the movie, but I'm not. I think it's wonderfully charming and moved at a brisk pace, never dragging, had great voice acting, a sharp script, and a fun, low stakes plot you could easily get invested in. Is it Pixar at its best? No, but it's Pixar comfort food. It's not going to blow you away, but you'll be hard pressed to find much you didn't love about it, either.",o34eyh
h2dwvz9,It was a fun 90 minute commerical for Vespa.,o34eyh
h2a4wbm,"Good Animation, fun characters, great score. I think its hurt a bit by some really formulaic and predictable story beats. 

Other problems I had were Luca's parents being ridiculously strict and kind of lousy, the main ""villain"" is pretty forgettable, climax was weak for me (everyone is just okay with sea monsters suddenly). 

I think this movie is close to greatness but something just feels missing for me.",o34eyh
h2eartu,"They should make a sequel where Luca and Giulia have a son and the son wants to go under the sea and be a sea monster not a human. That would be a great, interesting idea.",o34eyh
h2ijgbk,"The movie was pretty mid. The script, writing, storyboarding was tight. The themes, voice-acting, cultural/regional portrayal was spot on and seemed very authentic. But the story was really unmemorable, a bit soulless and lackluster. People comparing this movie to a studio ghilbi movie have no idea what they are talking about. They are nothing alike, Ghilbi movies are so unique with well crafted story that feels like something is happening in the story. Luca feels like there is a world, but nothing interesting is going on. Yes the story doesn't have to have high stakes or fully fleshed out but jesus do something interesting. In kiki's delivery service and totoro, nothing much happens in terms of story. But there are unique and magic aspects that draws you into the world. While in Luca, there are sea monsters.... and that's it? nothing to wowed or draw you in. Also the acceptance by the humans of sea monsters doesn't make much sense. It does seem like humans know of sea monsters, as they are known to hunt them I guess but it doesn't really make too much logical sense. But yeah it's a dumb kids movie so it doesn't have to make much sense. 6/10, would be 8/10 if the story was more memorable.",o34eyh

There‚Äôs nothing outright bad about Luca, but at this point Pixar are doing the same shit I‚Äôve seen over and over again from them at this point and it just kind of makes this movie a bit forgettable for me. It literally plays out a ‚ÄúFish Out of Water‚Äù story using Italy as its main selling point with a sea monster gimmick, but the plot beats play out with zero surprises and the characters are simple and bland. It looks and sounds great, but I expected more from Pixar. 5/10",o34eyh

h2bkfzw,"Two things I've noticed, Giulia's father raised the hand of the one kid who literally wasn't even in the contest which is a bit weird but not a big deal at all, and another thing is was there a reason Luca/Alberto weren't at all more... I don't know, morally confused about literally leading Giulia's father right to the spot where all the fish were hiding? Wouldn't they feel some connection to the fish or were those fish just not important to them?

Other than those things, absolutely loved the movie and I'm really happy I watched it. Some common plot points here and there like the whole Alberto getting jealous about Luca and how he's taking to his new life on the land and how he's getting along with Giulia, then fighting over it, then making up, but I didn't really mind it as it worked for the story. Also I see some people a little upset over it but I thought the whole Luca 'betrayal' thing was done really well and worked fine for the characters, IMO Alberto was stepping way out-of-line interfering acting like a jerk to Giulia, asking the questions about the sea-monsters right after Luca displayed interest in going to school and then basically trying to out Luca before he was ready or even without discussing it first, Luca's reaction obviously wasn't okay but I completely understand it and I don't blame him at all for doing it.",o34eyh

The low stakes, the characters, and the animation makes this film stick out to me when compared to Pixar‚Äôs other films. 


Even though the story is simple, I do see the queer tones that others have mentioned. I understand that the film is canonically about friendship and that Disney won‚Äôt make an LGBT film since they have to sell overseas but my mind kept piecing together a beautiful allegory about being gay and in the closet. Younger me would have been over the moon to have watched this. I especially loved the line by the grandma ‚ÄúSome people, they‚Äôll never accept him. But some will.

Oh and absolutely fucking stunning animation. Seriously beautiful. Where Soul perfectly captured the look of New York, this nailed the feel of a seaside Italian village. And when I think there‚Äôs not much left to do with Water, they take it to another level. 

I‚Äôll say 8.5/10. Probably will be higher on another rewatch. It‚Äôs a very un-Pixar Pixar movie, but in a good way. As opposed to something like Onward which feels like a totally different studio.

ON THE OTHER HAND, just like some watchers have commented, had it been only Giulia and one of the boys, then a romantic relationship between the two would have been alluded to or even created, which is kind of sad bc, like, it could also happen between two guys (Yeah yeah, ‚ÄúbUt ThEy‚ÄôRe kIdS‚Äù many ppl have their first relationship around the kids‚Äô ages or at least develop a crush at that age.

h29w1u0,"I liked this movie, but not as much as Coco, Soul, and Inside Out. There's something about this movie that's not clicking with me at times but I really enjoyed the animation and lighting throughout the entire movie. Also loved the cameo appearances of Pinocchio along The Fox and The Cat (this time not the well-known Disney version) during Luca's imagination sequence as a nod to the original version by Carolo Collodi.  Luca definitely fits the C-tier level of Pixar Movies next to ""Onward"" but not as memorable as The Good Dinosaur. 

Also am I the only person who's been actively searching for John Ratzenberg's voice in this movie? Because I remember Soul was the first Pixar movie that didn't feature Ratzenberg's voice, [instead he makes a background cameo](https://i.redd.it/ap5kfeae0ln61.jpg). Maybe I missed it since I watched this movie after breakfast this morning and will give this movie a second watch later on. At first I thought it was Luca's Uncle until the credits revealed it was Sasha Baron Cohen. [Hopase Pixar isn't beginning on ending their 25 year tradition of finding ways to sneak in his voice in their movies.](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/John-Ratzenberger-Pixar.jpg) Hopefully Pixar's next movie [""Red""](https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/Eo6rg0fXYAECGX8.jpeg) or [""Lightyear""](https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chrisevansbuzzlightyear710.jpg?w=710) might him back.

On an unrelated note, since I brought up Coco. I love how Disney and Pixar's latest movies are giving cultures and different diversities the public spotlight (Raya is based on South East Asian culture, Coco for Mexico, and Luca for the Italian Riviera). Due to his, I really hope a future Disney Movie or Pixar Film might someday make an animated film take place in Japan (specifically Ancient Japan) because of how fascinating and unique [Japanese mythology and folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mythology) is compared Greek Mythology ([just look at this list of Y≈çkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legendary_creatures_from_Japan)). The only time Disney work that briefly touched on Japanese culture was an episode of ""The Legend of The Three Caballeros"" (viewable on Disney+) where Donald, Panchito, and Jose end up in the afterlife where they encounter [Kappa, Kasa-Obake, and an Oni](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/scrooge-mcduck/images/2/20/Screenshot_2018-07-06_at_12.22.34_AM.png/revision/latest?cb=20180706042258). Heck, have the movie take place during [Tsukimi/Otsukimi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukimi) (Japanese version of The Mid-Autumn Festival) starring a Japanese boy or girl where they befriend a talking tanuki/raccoon dog and something involving a Moon Kingdom that's ruled by a White Rabbit Queen or Empresses and entirely inhabited by [Japanese hares](https://www.bokksu.com/blogs/news/japanese-folktale-rabbit-on-the-moon) who make ""Tsukimi Dango Cakes"" for the citizens of Japan. But that's just my idea, but something like this has so much potential. And this is coming from someone who grew up with the [""Pocky & Rocky"" series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zs9k7dzbMw).

If Pixar is able to make ""Coco"" become a tradition to watch around ""D√≠a de los Muertos"" with Mexican families. Then Japan deserves it's own version that is set around Tsukimi.",o34eyh

h2a760b,"I liked Luca but as I get older I feel like Pixar has sort of lost their way a little. A part of it is that Pixar movies used to be really special events that happened maybe once a year whereas now we've had Onward, Soul, and Luca all within 2 years. I suppose it is getting easier to animate and create these types of movies.

I also feel like we're seeing Pixar do more ""animation > story"" in their movies recently. Pixar to me was always ""amazing story with great animation"" but lately it feels like ""amazing animation with good story""

While I do appreciaite how great some of the animation is I don't ever recall Pixar having so many random/artsy/stylistic scenes in their OG movies. In my opinion Coco was really the tipping point where since then they've made movies to show off their animators and not their storytellers.",o34eyh
h2ic45t,"We can all agree that this movie was about being gay, right?",o34eyh
h2dan76,"It's irrelevant to me whether the two characters are in a relationship. Gay men can have platonic relationships with each other too. The idea of two men having to share a secret in a hostile environment surrounded by people threatening to out them in a tiny town, oh come on. Disney will never acknowledge it because of that sweet soldi. Two grannies living together for a long time and outing themselves honestly clinched it for me. It's either deliberately queer coded or deliberate queer baiting. There's really no subtlety at all.

As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it much more than I expected it to. Probably the closest Pixar has gotten to mimic that Ghibli magic. I am a sucker for low stakes slice of life movies, so honestly I'd have wished for a more mellow character driven third act but I guess that wouldn't be financially profitable. Definitely enjoyed this one more than Soul.",o34eyh
h2akwhh,"Loved this movie. It was beautiful.

At a thematic level I can see why LGBT people would connect with this film, it's all about feeling like an outsider and learning to be open, but the main characters are not gay, they're just friends.

Director Enrico Casarosa confirmed the film is not specifically about being gay, it's about a platonic male friendship. It's sad that men aren't allowed to have close, sensitive friendships without a subset of the fans making them gay. This is unhealthy and denormalizes male friendship.

The kids being monsters is a metaphor to feeling different, being outsiders. Anyone can connect with this. If the way you connect with this theme is through being LGBTQ+, it's completely valid, but the film is about male friendship. 

On the subject of Luca, [this is what director Enrico Casarosa had to say](https://news.disney.com/luca-first-look):

>The idea for the movie came from Casarosa‚Äôs childhood and his own friend Alberto (who he honored by giving Luca‚Äôs friend the same name). The two were an unlikely pair who ended up having the best friendship. ‚ÄúMy best friend Alberto was a bit of a troublemaker, [while] I was very timid and had a bit of a sheltered life ‚Äî we couldn‚Äôt have been more different,‚Äù shared Casarosa. ‚ÄúWe were also a bit of ‚Äòoutsiders,‚Äô so it felt right to use sea monsters to express the idea that we felt a little different and not cool as kids,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúAlberto pushed me out of my comfort zone, and pushed me off many cliffs, metaphorically and not. I probably would not be here if I didn‚Äôt learn to chase my dreams from him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs these types of deep friendships that I wanted to talk about in Luca, and that is what‚Äôs at the heart of this film.‚Äù Other influences on the movie include old Italian myths and folklore, including tales of dragons and the story of a bell-ringing octopus that saved a village from a band of pirates. ‚ÄúSome of these tales were actually made up by fishermen. They‚Äôd find a great fishing spot and they didn‚Äôt want anyone to take it over,‚Äù explained Casarosa.


The movie's message is about acceptance and openness with one self. Anyone can identify with these themes, that's why the movie's message is so wonderful (just saw it today, it's beautiful).

>In addition to friendship, this movie‚Äôs message about acceptance ‚Äî for yourself, as well as others ‚Äî is a valuable one, particularly in current times. Producer Andrea Warren, who was drawn to the movie right away after learning the storyline, expanded: ‚ÄúWe always liked the idea that the metaphor of being a sea monster can apply to so many different things. There is a theme of openness, showing oneself and self-acceptance, as well as community acceptance. Confronting the idea that there's more to sea monsters than they realized. You know that they've only seen it through one perspective, one lens, and so I think that that's a wonderful theme in the film, which is that those ideas weren't right and that there's more to learn.‚Äù Casarosa agreed: ‚ÄúWe hope that ‚Äòsea monster‚Äô could be a metaphor for all [manners] of feeling different ‚Äî like being a teen or even pre-teen ‚Äî any moment where you feel odd. It felt like a wonderful way to talk about that and having to accept ourselves first, whatever way we feel different.‚Äù

Gay people especially can identify with these themes so at a thematic level it's all there. There's no need to change the actual platonic, close male friendship depicted on-screen. Luca and Alberto are not gay, and are not meant to be gay, they're close friends. 

I think it's unhealthy that every time two men are boys are shown to have a close, sensitive friendship, a subset of the fans will immediately make them gay. This tells men that they can't have emotional connection to other men unless they're gay and feeds into the stereotype that all gay men are sensitive and emotional. It's harmful to both sides. 


In a Yahoo interview, upon being asked if Luca and Alberto are gay and if he was inspired by Call Me By Your Name, the director said pretty clear:

>‚ÄúI love Luca‚Äôs movies and he‚Äôs such a talent but it truly goes without saying that we really willfully went for a pre-pubescent story,‚Äù Casarosa laughs. ‚ÄúThis is all about platonic friendships.‚Äù",o34eyh

I don't know how to explain it, but their recent films have felt like, while still amazing movies in their own right, somewhat a meta deconstruction of the classic ""Pixar formula"", trying to outdo itself each time as a new iteration of some ideal Pixar perfection.  Luca just simply tells its story and is so obviously not caught up in that super self awareness, and it makes for a more immersive experience.

Beautiful stylized visuals which I appreciate were focused more on feeling and abstract expression instead of photorealism.  The characters were fully fleshed and I would say the best developed part of the entire movie in terms of writing was Giulia's dad.  The way he is built up throughout the story, and how that contrasts with his ultimate purpose in the narrative at the end, is surprising, logical, and emotionally effective.

h2d8p8c,"I've been having a gut feeling that the 2020s will be the start of Pixar's ""Dark"" age similar to what Disney went through in the 70s and early 80s, Luca proves this supposition

Now Luca isn't a bad film, it's pretty decent, a fine little film with cute animation. But that's just what it is, pretty good, but not memorable; Witch as a stand-alone film is good, and in the past, a film like this could have been easy to ignore. However in the Grand large scheme of things in Pixar's legacy moving forward, it' leaves me concernedLuca I think is truly the start of a new era of Pixar. The post napkin pack    (John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich) era of Pixar we have been in for almost 30 years now.I get the impression that since  no new projects made by these guys have been announced, and  getting up in age, These guys preparing for retirement and pass the torch to a new generation of animators(or in the case of john Lasseter got fired from Pixar for sexual harassment and moved over to Skydance/Apple tv Plus.)

In the past, a  pretty alright/forgettable   Pixar movie could be counterbalanced next year with a film from one of these guys( Onward with Soul, Monster Univstery/ The Good dinosaur with  Inside out)   That's not going to be the case anymore.As such Luca has me concerned.

i feel, Pixar  is making the same mistake,   Disney made in the 70s,  leading them to go through sort of indinty crisis. Were first wave Pixar employees never thought of a P  Post Napkin pack Pixar world.  leading the 2nd and 3rd wave of animators to now start to take the helm, not knowing what to do, or how to keep the studio's legacy going.  And like Disney in the 70s and early 80s  their answer  ""How do we be like the past Pixar"" rather than ""How do we become a new Pixar?"" I mean, look their next two projects, Lightyear and Turing Red sound like Spoof Pixar movie on The Simpsons making fun of Pixar then real Pixar is real movies

.Add to the fact that many are predicting that  Bob Chapeck is looking like he's setting a course for the possibility the Disney empire  fall once more, creatively/ public respect wise ,It only adds to the concern.

PS. When I mean creatively bankrupt and losing the  Public respect, I'm talking about the possibility of Kevin Figue leaving the mcu, over"" creative differences"",  I'm talking about them getting rid of Searchlight pictures because ""It doesn't make us any money""  while at the same time greenlighting reboots, remakes, and sequels of Fox/Disney properties on the artistic quality As say  ""  The Haunted Mansion movie ""   or""  Inspector Gadget"" film.

The ending was really meh and has me leaning with the people saying ""this film is a weak Pixar film"" I mean, these guys were hunted. Years of ""propaganda"" that they are monsters, suddenly A-Ok? Just like that? 

Also, while not necessarily a stretch, some saying it's a LGBT film, I kinda have to raise an eyebrow and disagree. So because Luca ""came out"", and the old ladies did too at the end, does that make his parents(husband and wife) gay too? Does that automatically make every sea person gay, by default? 

Also, I kinda wish they explained WHY they transformed into humans, unless I completely missed it. But yeah, my closing thoughts towards this film is simply


It's not that deep. I think it's ""bland"" enough that everyone can see themselves in the characters haha.

But let's not pretend it's the dangerously high scores and praise is representative of the actual movie unless we never want to see another finding nemo or lion king ever again.  7 / 10 = 70% fresh.",o34eyh

h2audwn,"For people arguing there's no LGBT themes in the film - the whole thing was very clearly inspired by Call Me by Your Name. From the title and main character's appearance, all the way to the final scene at the train station. No, ""Luca"" is not about romantic love, but it is about the process of discovering and accepting yourself for who you are, and it was absolutely meant to be read that way. The association with Guadagnino's film is also intentional, no matter what the director says. If you saw both then it's clear it's not a coincidence. The creators have just made a choice not to admit this.",o34eyh

Message applies to all weirdos, outsiders, ""underdogs"".

Not gonna lie, as a queer person I was excited for this movie because of all of the rumors about the boys being queer, but I was happy with the outcome anyways. (And when Giulia winked at Alberto when she was getting on the train I THOUGHT IT WAS A NOD TO SOMETHING but I digress...
Great film. Not at the top of the Pixar list, but a great addition!

Alsooooo, did anyone else think that there was gonna be a reveal that Alberto's name was actually Bruno?
And ""Silencio Bruno!"" is what his dad Alberto said to him everytime he tried to do things with him, and his way of feeling close to his dad is using his name but by the end of the film realizes that Massimo could be a father figure and he can let that name go? 
Just me?",o34eyh

too bad disney sucks and won‚Äôt let them actually be gay.

edit: just finished and honestly there‚Äôs no heterosexual explanation for the contents of the film so i‚Äôm gonna declare Luca and Alberto Pixar‚Äôs first gay couple tbh

really sweet film that i honestly think is an LGBT sort of allegory, telling the gays to come out and celebrate Pride month. cried several times, Pixar does it again",o34eyh
h2bl1q4,"Apparently Pixar is expected to deliver a meta--societal-meaning to every film they make... well I love this movie because that isn't as clear as in other Pixar movies. I absolutely love Alberto and I really felt for him. I think you can also see the resemblance between Luca and Miguel from Coco. >!Some moments in the movie I thought they really went for the queer version, because Alberto got really jealous of Luca. However, I also loved the story they went with: Alberto is jealous because he is afraid the person he became to love will leave him again, just like his dad. He did not want to see Luca be better friends with the girl than with him. !<

The only critique I have is that the story was a bit too rushed, or, there was too little screentime for the story to develop all the way as it should have. The most obvious part would be the 'oh well I guess this whole town forgets about sea monsters now in an instant"" and the parents being totally fine with everything all of a sudden. Overall, I liked it very much.",o34eyh

h2o0637,"Not the best Pixar film but it was good. The animation was very crisp, clean and neat. The pacing of the story in my opinion was a little off. Things just kept happening. And the movie expects audience to just accept things. Like what‚Äôs the history behind these human/fish hybrids? Where do they come from? Why do they exist? The movie doesn‚Äôt bother explaining at all and just says ‚Äúaccept their existence, don‚Äôt question it.‚Äù

Also this town was obsessed with sea monsters but the moment they see one they‚Äôre like ‚Äúeh who cares‚Äù",o34eyh
h2z8xtx,"Beautifully animated and scored of course. Sweet story too although my tears remained unjerked at the end.

h2ajr3t,"Weird to see people keep saying things like ""well it's not in Pixar's top ____"". What does that accomplish?

The Miyazaki influence looms large on this one, one could even argue that it's ripping Ghibli off.

Two things that work to it's detriment and proves why Miyazaki is one of a kind are all the small 'Disney moments' that later culminate in the 'best case scenario for every single character'-ending and that awfully generic Calarts art style.

h2gq3od,"I just finished watching the movie. I just have a few thoughts. 

1. Do they live in a world where mythological creatures are normal? When the villagers see the two main characters for the first time is that a world-shattering event or a normal day? Do they give their species a name beyond monster?  This is especially confusing when considering the end credits and his ride on the train. 

2. I was slightly annoyed how the story went out of it's way getting the two main characters wet. I did find it funny when the parents looked for their son by getting everyone wet.


3. I thought Julia's dad was awesome!

I wasn't blown away by the villain or the whole concept of the race, but I think the reveal was the downfall. It was rushed and far too easily explained; surely the villagers wouldn't just accept their sworn enemies living among them so quickly?


I don't think it's an instant classic, but it's not a waste of time either. It looks beautiful and for the first act alone is worth a watch.",o34eyh

I hope Pixar steadies on with lighter fare like this. Not every movie needs to give 40 year olds existential crises.

Some of the messaging bugged me, like human waste in the sea being treated as precious treasures rather than harmful pollutants, and Massimo's empathy only existing when the situation affects him personally, but those are relatively minor issues in the grand scheme. 

I also get why Disney released this one straight to streaming. Not sure it would have exactly lit up the box office, but hopefully lots of young eyes will find it online because it's very charming.",o34eyh

While the animation was beautiful and I thought the concept was original and unique and the setting original and unique, and the ending actually did pull on my heart strings a little, with a pretty good message for children. My problem is that the original concept is kindof wasted on boring kids movie cliches and the film itself was just very boring, not to mention it doesn't help they clearly wanted the two male leads to be gay, or at least he a metaphor for a gay couple but disney wouldn't let that happen.

And yet this movie pissed me off for 2 reasons.

1. Luca was overall unlikeable for the sole reason he betrayed Alberto just because he thought of himself. If that one scene was reworked, it would be so much better.

2. They literally just ripped off the toy story 4 ending where it's the ho's before bros type of ending. Before anyone calls me sexist, I know the girl isn't a ho and she is smart. The issue is that just like woody, luca opts to just go with the girl rather than stay with the stable life

And yet people are apparently fine with those 2 points. Please tell me why as I'm having a hard time tolerating luca. It saddens me I hate this as I really loved soul and onward. Even cars 2 I find better and that was mediocre",o34eyh

h2uqg8b,Yeah I got major ghibli vibes from this one and I loved it,o34eyh
ha4h4ve,I‚Äôm late to this but I think Portorosso is a play on the directors name Casarosa (red port vs pink house). The director grew up near Genoa in a similar town,o34eyh

h4hmn6d,Maya Rudolph is the GOAT and she secures the bag üí∞,o34eyh
h2mqx9t,There's a reason she won an Emmy for her VO work on Big Mouth. You should watch the show and check it out for yourself.,o34eyh
h2blano,It‚Äôs started to bother me actually. I think her voice has been over utilized in animated films recently.,o34eyh
h2cx8cp,She's amazing as the grandmother in Bless the Harts.,o34eyh
h2ln6e1,I thing that I heard one actress saying she wants her kids to be able to watch at least one of her movies when they're young so she did an animated voice over work... Maybe that's how maya feels idk,o34eyh

h2mgjcb,Yep perfectly said,o34eyh
h2mg737,Savage but true - Raya put wayyyy too much trust into the backstabbing girl and that major plot point kinda ruined it for me,o34eyh
h32qpn0,Raya wanted to be representative and then they just shat on everything else that is required to be a good movie. They did it all with low effort. And I‚Äôm saying this as a Vietnamese person. Fuck movies like that,o34eyh

h2lutez,"> There seems to be a narrative going around that its one of Pixar‚Äôs weaker fare on the level of Good Dinosaur and maybe part of that is because it went straight to Disney+.

What an insult to Luca lmao. The Good Dinosaur was such a mishappen mess of mixed emotions and identities. Luca was pretty tight in knowing what it wanted to be; a more lighthearted affair of a film that still has emotion, but it isn't reveling in its deep emotion like what Onward or Soul did. There is NOTHING wrong with a film being a lighter affair if it services the movie, which Luca does and it's fucking great.",o34eyh
h2tnnt7,There seems to be a narrative that every damn pixar movie just HAS to be compared to it‚Äôs predecessors. To that I say ‚ÄòSilenzio Bruno!!‚Äô,o34eyh
h3w34vy,"> because it went straight to Disney+

Soul went straight to Disney+. I think Disney is treating Pixar like content for their service, and their own animations as premium content (which is ridiculous).",o34eyh
h2a8xb1,Definitely my favorite line of the movie. Hope some young viewers can take that message to heart.,o34eyh
h2arlbg,"Same, I really liked they didn't rose tint it by just being like ""and the world was actually lovely and if you just accept yourself everything will be totally ok"" I think it was a good mix between optimistic/inspiring but realistic sentiment.",o34eyh

h2cxoym,I know people get worked up when people were hoping/thinking this was going to Pixar‚Äôs first gay love story but it‚Äôs really hard to not see comparisons with a line like that because as a gay person that hits hard,o34eyh
h2e4w7q,Wish more people other than Ercole was shown on the side of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt accept him‚Äù. I guess the townsfolk that were scared off by the dad got into that category but still felt like there wasn‚Äôt enough of that ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be accepted everywhere‚Äù message in the film to have it stick.,o34eyh

h2a7y2l,"This. And it made Alberto‚Äôs last line to Luca hit me so much harder. So simple, so surprisingly cathartic.",o34eyh
h2a87l6,"The low stakes and fun environment made me think of various ""summer fun movies"" like The Sandlot, and also various Ghibli movies like Kiki's delivery service and Totoro.",o34eyh
h2bzrft,It was hard to believe it was a Pixar movie. The main character had two living parents who he had a healthy relationship with and they had fairly normal family conflict.  It‚Äôs like a breath of fresh air - usually Pixar characters hit you over the head with their daddy issues so hard you can‚Äôt really think about anything else.,o34eyh
h2e9ts8,*Charming* is the best adjective I can think of. It has a heartwarming story and is a really easy movie to watch,o34eyh

h2bpwnb,Also the animation helps to convey that sort of mood.,o34eyh
h2glnos,"Also nice spot for Liguria. As a Genoa native, it felt good. Although I was a bit sad that they didn't show more from Genova in the end (there's a still shot around the 1:25 mark, from Spianata Castelletto, but that's all).",o34eyh

h2ad1un,That water was amazing. I was stunned at it being animation.,o34eyh
h2aqc41,"I thought it did a really good job of making the scenery still feel animated though. In The Good Dinosaur the characters felt out of place because of the photoreal landscape. But in this, everything felt cohesive.",o34eyh
h2ak1lu,I thought the water in Raya was really well done too and then Luca managed to top them. Water is the hardest thing to animate and Disney has crushed it twice in a row now.,o34eyh
h2apmd7,The details in the rocks and stonework were insane.,o34eyh

h4e1fbv,"As someone who has tried to make and render photorealistic clouds before, the ending to the movie made me genuinely say out loud ""Holy fucking shit!"" those clouds were so fucking good!

The bushes and greenery were all amazingly dense and extremely well lit too, I have no idea how they continue to improve but it happens!",o34eyh
h2g5hne,Which is crazy because on this sub specifically I got downvoted to hell for defending it when people said it looked ugly.,o34eyh
h2w5395,"I spent so much time just geeking out over the animation. The hair, omg, I‚Äôm just thinking about the bake time on that. Don‚Äôt get me started on the fuzz on the jumpers, or the individually rendered stones on the beach. Pixar is putting on an absolute clinic for 3D animation.",o34eyh
h4ko9wa,"that head balling by mother was some crazy and funny and so spot on animation, lmao..",o34eyh
h3701rd,"It actually bugged me a LOT. It‚Äôs technically stunning, but they did nothing interesting visually in it I feel like. They copied about 20 scenes frame for frame of Ghibli movies and like‚Ä¶ that was it with their levels of trying to show technical prowess. The transformations were kind of cool, but could have been way cooler. It‚Äôs funny that for a movie so ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by Ghibli films they failed to even remotely be whimsical and inventive in any way on their own. It‚Äôs animation; you can do literally *anything* and they made something that could‚Äôve been live action for like 75% of it instead.",o34eyh

h2medb0,My cats named Mookie and we call her Mookieavelli sometimes lol,o34eyh
h2a2uky,">One of the only complaints i have is the parents seemingly trying to out their child trying to find him?

Yeah I can understand the parents throwing water on kids who were on their own, but it was pretty stupid that they were doing it in the middle of town with loads of people watching.

It lowers the stakes even more when the parents don't seem bothered about people seeing him even though they were about to send him away for just being on the island with no one around. 

I still really liked the movie but that bothered me a bit because it was so unnecessary.",o34eyh
h2a6o64,Luca being an unlikeable backstabbing idiot does not make the film good,o34eyh
h5kcvay,"I know, it made me tear up :'(",o34eyh
h2aej4f,"It felt like mouths had a lower frame rate, which made it feel a bit like claymation. I kind of liked it.

I also enjoyed the super subtle flux in their voices while underwater.",o34eyh
h29vyzu,Charming is the perfect word for it. It may not be top tier but definitely worth the watch.,o34eyh
h2hc7at,"They did a lot of ""mouth on side of face"" poses which is very old-style cartoon looking, and I loved it.",o34eyh
h2a7r6i,The shape language of the characters made me think of what you'd get if you started with the Steven Universe style of character design but then blew out of the stops on rendering fidelity.,o34eyh
h2jwp6o,Giuilia reminded me of a Peanuts character (in a totally good way),o34eyh

h32gtg7,"I knew I recognized him! 

I knew when I heard him say ‚Äúvery nice‚Äù",o34eyh

h2cmqu1,"Hate to be that type of Italian, but ‚Äúsilencio‚Äù is the Spanish spelling. In Italian it‚Äôs ‚Äúsilenzio‚Äù! 

But yeah, as a parent I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm too keen on that message. I think that usually the inner voice is what keeps us from being foolish in the first place. But hey, maybe that‚Äôs the legacy of me having very strict parents and generally being too much of a ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù",o34eyh
h59ruvw,"I mean, it's one thing to overcome your fears, but the way Alberto was using it was to overcome your sense of self-preservation.

But if you want to - Get back to that risk taking kid you were. You still got it. Don‚Äôt listen to Bruno. SILENCIO BRUNO!! 

In all seriousness- remember to take some small risks this summer and live a little - meet up some old friends and go hiking where you‚Äôve never gone before or somethin. Idk you sounded like you wanted a pep talk sorry if I misread your post.",o34eyh
h2d0ifs,"Same, man. Same.",o34eyh
h2pt2xk,My boyfriend started to tear up at that part too. It brought up the memories of him helping his 2 childhood best friends move to different states across the country.,o34eyh

Luca‚Äôs separation from Alberto hurts so much. You can have many friends but theres always that one whos just the perfect partner and crime, teammate, comrade and most importantly a true brother.",o34eyh

Leave it to Pixar to make an incredibly low-stakes pleasant film and still have you sobbing at the end",o34eyh
h2asycy,"Oh my god I literally gasped when Luca betrayed him like that.

I felt so bad for Alberto and their talk afterwards at the fort hit even harder!",o34eyh
h2c9phb,"The villain was great. It is kind of refreshing to have a villain who is just a dick, and not some misunderstood character with big plans or something.


Honestly, the last 10 years of Pixar hage been kind of meh, with the exeption of maybe Coco and Inside Out. But Luca made me feel like Pixar still has it. I think it might be in my top 3 Pixar movies. Best visuals out of any animated movie I have seen, and the story was fantastic.


Also, the core message and obvious metaphor was well done imo. It was the right balance of being clear without being too loud about it.",o34eyh
h2dj3ou,Ercole was pretty funny to be honest. He‚Äôs a just an arsehole and the accent probably made him more likeable lol,o34eyh
h2mtbh8,"That was legitimately amazing, I loved that part. Where he straight up double crossed him. I was already hooked but that really made me sink into the characters, they were all so extremely well written and felt like actual people/kids rather than cartoon characters.


So it was also a bit of a let down for me as well they didn‚Äôt really flesh that out that much. I honestly want to spend more time watching these characters.",o34eyh
h4o1h6f,"Yeah still feel like Luca is an asshole after that. Surely, it worked out in the end since Julia immediately discovered he was also a sea monster right after but Alberto deserves better",o34eyh
h2a6r6h,The problem is that it ruins Lucas character. It makes the whole film unpleasant to watch,o34eyh
h3abhfn,"Seems I enjoyed this more than you, but we definitely   find common ground in that ending scene. I'm a pretty big sucker for best friend stories. Anyways, check out ""Chaim Potok's The Chosen"" if you haven't.",o34eyh
h2bm4rn,"I agree, but a combination of:

1. The bully acting like a real monster
2. Julias dad (who everyone was expecting to catch the sea monsters) giving the ok

h2d2s8s,[deleted],o34eyh
h2dzbdg,"Eh, I mean, they just watched the sea monsters participate in a race, help a kid out, and talk in a rational way. Plus they probably saw/interacted with the kids as humans throughout the summer. Maybe I'm naive, but I think that'd give most reasonable people pause.",o34eyh
h2gbem4,"When the burly Dad fisherman stands behind them, the other fishermen sigh and stand down. The fisherman even walk away from the crowd, and are not seen among the cheering crowd as the camera zooms out.

I imagine that some of the other fishermen would capture/kill the ""sea monsters"" if not for the social pressure of that particular crowd and the Dad's imposing presence.

Some of the people in the village will keep their prejudices, I'm sure. I think the show introduced just enough realism in the mother's quote, ""Not everyone will accept him, but he seems to know how to find the good ones.""",o34eyh
h2s30fu,"Throughout the movie, while it seems like there is a cultural fear of the sea monsters, the only people we see actively hating/fearing them are the fishermen, the policewoman (posting the reward), and then Ericole's gang.

For the fishermen, the father was such an intimidating presence (and clearly had a strong reputation in the town) that they chose to back down at that moment of the race. The other fishermen with harpoons didn't looked pleased when they had to back off.

Ericole's cronies (at the moment of the race) didn't so much become pro-sea monster and anti-Ericole.

When two of the older ladies were revealed to also be sea monsters, the human old ladies then took the police officer's poster from her and ripped it up. Grandmas and old ladies in a tiny town are huge pillars of the community and have a lot of social power.

Plus the priest (who we hadn't seen being pro or anti sea monster) treated them neutrally, so there was more social pressure for the people in the crowd to not be actively bigotted.

Basically, I think that at the race there was enough social pressure from people who are important in the community to not have the mob hunt them at that moment, which then lead to begrudging acceptance after the movie, and maybe eventual loss of fear.

A love the line from the grandma, ""not everyone will accept him, but he seems like he knows how to find the people who will.""",o34eyh
h2dhih0,"Yeah, the policia should have beat the child sea monsters. Then mama and papa eat them and Massimos other arm and the villagers fall in line.",o34eyh
h2mtnfc,"I agree, that part and the verrry end where he goes to school. It felt slightly forced or rushed to send him off when he didn‚Äôt really even know what school was and in real life kids usually hate school. His whole character wasn‚Äôt about wanting to learn, so it felt like a slightly odd and unrelated note to end the film on. 

LOVED the movie though.",o34eyh
h2diebl,Yes that part felt a little rushed but maybe if they make another movie they can show it‚Äôs not as straightforward as accepting them.,o34eyh

h2o0um1,Right that whole town was dedicated to hunting sea monsters. They even have a statue of a man hunting a sea monsters.,o34eyh
h3eoqaq,"For me, the town basically didn't question that sea monsters exist, but rather they were evil

After seeing them not be too evil they were cool with it (seeing them as ""people"")",o34eyh

h2ic83i,yeah... especially when he went to a completely different town.,o34eyh

h2c6zmy,"The director is a big Miyazaki fan.

From IMDB

""Director Enrico Casarosa stated that he drew inspiration from the films of Hayao Miyazaki when creating the film. The character Luca's original last name was Portorosso, a nod to Miyazaki's Kurenai No Buta (1992) (in English, Porco Rosso).

h2cb48u,"I really don't see it tbh, or rather i think people overstate it a lot.  
Ghibli's vibe is way more free flowing, interested in moments to showcase human qualities of all kinds, this was very much a pixar movie with its gags and plot focused storytelling",o34eyh

Even the director said it was just about a summer of fun and that's exactly the vibe I got. Slight Little Mermaid vibes in the ""the surface is dangerous, humans are bad"" sentiment, and Ghibli vibes in the fun colors and friendship themes.

Alberto was a kid who had abandonment issues and Luca never had a friend before Alberto. Their friendship made sense and so did Alberto's jealousy of Giulia; he was afraid of getting left behind again. He's the stereotypical ""I don't care but actually I care deeply"" type.

The ending was so refreshing. It's bittersweet but >!it's showing that the two boys are growing up and paving their own paths and making the selfless decisions to support each other.

At the end of the movie, Alberto gets rid of his Vespa because he realizes it was nothing more than a silly dream, which wouldn‚Äôt really be the message that a brand wants to give. I bet Pixar asked to include Vespa in the movie, having the kids dream about liberty without making those dreams a bit stupid would have been very cliche.

As a bonus, there‚Äôs a very famous song here in Italy from 1999, the kind of song you sing with friends around a campfire, called ‚Äù50 Special‚Äù. It‚Äôs all about a guy failing his classes, and dreaming of going around with his girlfriend on a Vespa.

The thing with Queer Coding is that its usually more obvious to queer people then others. For me, the movie basically did a after school special on coming out in the 2000s. 

I am suprised noone has written out an article comparing the movie to a coming out movie. Starting with ""Of coarse its my first time, im a good kid"" to the human's father ""Born this way"" disability talk to Luca and his friend traveling the world together (first loves in general are so extreme) to the two grandmas coming out together (sappho and her friend ) to Luca and Alberto not wanting to let each others hands go on the train. That scene at the end of Alberto chasing the train is in alot of romantic movies. 

Oh and the betraying scene. Alberto was gonna out himself (out of jealousy) to show the girls prejudice. In order to not be labeled as monster himself, Luca had to out Alberto and act disgusted by him to everyone. Reminds me of those episodes where one of the two gay lovers comes out, and the gay jock becomes super homophonic in front of his friends to save face . 

Oh I remember now, this reminds me also of my favorite gay movie ""The way he looks"" If you want a happy gay movie go watch it. Its good, you have to use subtitles though",o34eyh

h30510u,"From what I understand: **Luca's whole arc is that he wants to explore the surface world, even if it means leaving his family and life behind**. He thought roaming the world with one person would satisfy him, and it was the same goal that Alberto had. Hell, he was so desperate to stay in the surface, he's willing to hide in a village far from his home, then find a Vespa to get even further from his parents.

But his goal changed (or at least got more detailed). Luca figured out he doesn't just want to roam the world, he wants to *learn* about it. He still wants to explore the world, but in a different angle. Luca said himself he was more of the 'thinking type' compared to Alberto, even after he learned how to bike. He also wanted to be able to mingle with other humans, even if they might discover who he is.

Of course, that's what causes the fight between him and Alberto, because Alberto wanted them both to just be lone wanderers; not staying too long in one place, and probably not being too close to other non-fish people. But that all gets sorted. Alberto himself figures out that he doesn't want to roam the world, but stick around Portorosso and connect with humans around him. And Alberto doesn't have to live alone anymore.

By the end, Luca (and Alberto) gets what he wants. But Luca doesn't leave his family behind. Unlike before, when he wants to abandon his family completely, now Luca's willing to keep in touch. It also fits with his parents' story arc, with how they've learned to let their son into the world, and trust that he'll do alright (kind of like Marlin's story in Finding Nemo).

Leaving Alberto? Definitely sad, but again, they'll keep in contact. We see in the credits that they have regular phone calls and letters, while Alberto gets a happy life as one of the townspeople. And Luca still has Giulia, so he's got at least one best friend by his side.

They're not even *that* far apart. Genoa (where Giulia's home and school is) is a 1 hour and 30-ish minute train ride from the area Portorosso is based on. It's not like Luca's on the other end of the country, they're still in the same province. I bet they can visit each other, even outside of summer.

I personally gathered that the ""Sea Monster"" community more used the ""Up is bad"" story as a way to control the younger generations. His parents were more concerned about Luca being ""normal"" (& thus safe) then being different.

Aside from that, completely agree with you. This is much more a ""Good for the kids and the parents won't get too bored"" (Cars) rather than a ""blows your mind"" (Inside Out, Soul, etc) kind film.",o34eyh

h2akr72,"I felt the same.  The ending acceptance didn't feel earned at all, for two reasons (for me):

1) They never really show the humans having any real hatred for the sea monsters.  They have the reward posters and mention killing sea monsters, and they have harpoons but none of it ever feels like a real threat.  I don't know how they would fix this though, other than having a human actually kill a sea monster, which would be a bit violent for a kid's film.

2) They don't really do anything to 'earn' the acceptance, they just... win a race.  When they showed that Giulia was not a good swimmer I assumed one of the two would end up having to save her out in the water, and the townspeople would attack them until they realized they were helping.  But instead... they just win a bicycle race.  On one hand it sends a good message (you should never need to 'earn' someone's acceptance of who you are), but given that the townspeople supposedly hate them, the impetus for them to change their mind wasn't super convincing.  It made the issue with point 1 even more glaring, that there was never any real threat to begin with.",o34eyh

(Didn‚Äôt help they made the parents way too overprotective and just hit you over the head that idea over and over.) From the beginning you know that Luca is gonna leave and him and Alberto are going to go to the human town.

Then from the moment you hear about the race it‚Äôs ‚Äúyeah he‚Äôs gonna win and the towns gonna accept them for who they are right?‚Äù And yeup. Townspeople flip on a dime and suddenly like him because he won a race. It‚Äôs a very sweet movie but seeing every cliche play out as always was a bit...meh",o34eyh

Without those scenes it really is just a story about friendship, but those definitely pushed it into the realm of the LGBTQ experience. 

Yes. This experience of being an ""other"" can be universal, but coming out is a very specific trope that applies to LGBTQ and some biracial individuals who could pass as white eg.

So yes, I read it that way, but not through any lens of sexuality.  Somehow I managed to feel great empathy anyway.  Imagine that.

I did not detect any hint of gayness OR heterosexualness in any of the three lead characters, they were all just friends doing their best to win a race.  One wanted to win for respect, the other two wanted to win to buy a Vespa.

Just looking through a telescope blew their minds, and owning a Vespa meant the possibility of circumnavigating the globe.  I miss having that kind of innocent outlook myself, and saw myself in their yearning to learn and explore.

I'm not justifying it, it's a shitty thing to do, but both of them were in the wrong there and I can definitely understand why it happened.

Now if Alberto had been walking around and someone accidently got water all over him and he was exposed and Luca did that then I'd agree, but that's not the case, he purposely revealed himself when he could pretty easily tell that Luca was not comfortable with it and one thing just led to another.

And for the second point, how is going to school with a girl he likes missing out on the 'stable life'? What's not stable about him getting an education and being happy while his friend also achieves a similar goal, finally getting a father-figure and being happy? I'd argue that he's closer to the girl (no idea how to spell the name) then he is Alberto especially if you take the credit scene pictures (which I'd assume are canon) into consideration.

h2ilwrc,"Only credit I'll give him is that he logically followed through with his cultural upbringing of hating sea monsters and not just Disney-like giving up cuz he met some. I mean, do y'all know humans? He was the most human character, hence, why we hate him lol.",o34eyh
h2e03fh,"Still kinda works though, since everyone (besides the bullies themselves I guess) can relate to wanting to stick it to the bully kid who's an asshole for no reason",o34eyh

h2ut6yr,Plot twist: he is actually the offspring of senor Vespa. But like third or fourth born one so he gets non of the recognition or the inheritance (think frozen).,o34eyh

h2d5snk,"Remember to boil the water first, and then add the pasta. A lot of people put the pasta in water and then heat the whole thing until it boils, but it‚Äôs not the right way when trying Italian recipes. That mistake makes it a lot more soft, and not ‚Äúal dente‚Äù",o34eyh

igwjqn4,Loved their relationship.,o34eyh
h2le2lu,"There was a boy with a leg brace early on too, and a woman in a wheelchair near the end. Didn't love the film but I like how Disney is handling representation. I think Onward had a couple of background characters signing as well.",o34eyh
hdaltin,"Which is more surprising given it's barely post fascist Italy, I think.",o34eyh
h4o30ah,"Yeah, have to hard agree with this.. Movies and series that take themselves and their story too seriously are way to great in number these days. Even worse when you get narratives that were seemingly written in a way that confuses the writers as well. And don't even get me started on the edgelord/tragedy trend.",o34eyh
h3idofq,My kids liked Luca a lot more.  The lessons were more approachable (don't judge people for being different) and it didn't go over their head (in emotions inside a brain being people),o34eyh
h2jwijq,I also liked Luca a lot better than either of those films.,o34eyh
h57xu93,"Well, not better than Inside Out, but better than Soul, yeah. Had a lot more... heart.",o34eyh
h583z7p,"Me too! And I REALLY like Inside Out. This film honestly reminded me of Hilda or something like that, where it‚Äôs laid back but stuff still happens and it‚Äôs not boring/babyish. There are a LOT of kids shows/movies where the writers seem to think ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not make the stakes too high‚Äù but they take it too far and lower the stakes so much that NOTHING happens and it‚Äôs not interesting/exciting for anyone but toddlers who have never seen a movie/tv show before. This isn‚Äôt like that:)",o34eyh

h2dklze,"Honestly, all I could think was Ron Swanson.",o34eyh
h3atmkl,"I'll make you a little correction, Porta Rossa is not a city but the name of a street in the city of Florence.  

""Porta"" means Door while ""Porto"" means Port.  
The two words have different meanings. 

""Rossa"" is the feminine version to indicate the color red, in Italian almost all words are deemed to be either feminine or masculine, and must agree with each other with the gender in question.
Porta, is a word considered feminine in Italian so it must be used with the final -a, Ross-a.  
Porto instead is a masculine word and therefore must be used with the final -o, Ross-o.

Porta and Porto are one of the exceptions for which the same word changes meaning depending on the final letter, so Porta doesn't have a male version and Porto doesn't have a female version.",o34eyh

h2ldnpr,The skinny one reminded me of Five from Umbrella Academy,o34eyh
h2dr9cm,Who was the voice of Luca‚Äôs uncle!,o34eyh
h2nrfq0,"Ya Namaari showed no genuine remorse, she never really apologized for what she did, and never really demonstrated she should be trusted. Luca on the other hand was genuinely contrite, and when he was presented with an opportunity to make things better, he jumped on it immediately",o34eyh
h2oka5b,"Yet why did that get the theatrical release while this went straight to streaming? I would pay twice the amount I did for Raya to see this on a bigger screen, all around a better use of my time.",o34eyh
h2ij5p3,I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve heard they always create a new animation technology in every Pixar film,o34eyh
h2fbzup,"I don't know if that's always the case, but yeah, they're often combined with new animation techniques. 

Frozen had a new way to render snow, Moana had a new way to do realistic water, etc.

Edit: duh, those aren't Pixar movies.",o34eyh
h2x6lxn,"I think some movies only get made as an excuse to develop new tech for future movies. For instance if I told you that ""The Good Dinosaur"" was simply a way to make money developing tech to make realistic environments it wouldn't sound crazy.",o34eyh
h54e6r2,"I think the huge achievement in this one was animating partially-transformed characters.

They would at minimum have to have one rig driving two models seamlessly, plus some way to ‚Äúpaint‚Äù the transformation (human torso and legs, monster head; or human head and midsection but monster legs; partial hand/arm transformations), and then a way of blending the edges of the two in-render‚Ä¶ all while preserving the ability to art direct every aspect of it to suit the story/character. 

I barely know CG stuff and I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how much work went into all these systems.",o34eyh
h39lthb,IIRC a lot of their shorts were built around showing a particular new animation technology they had,o34eyh

h2gw07i,"I have just watched the movie and came here to confirm I wasn't the only one who saw that analogy. It definitely brought memories of being in the closet and my friends telling me that the right people will accept me no matter what.

That was really touching. Really enjoyable film, very nice message",o34eyh

h2pjazi,"Yes I kind of agree but it fits right with the message ""Surround yourself with the right people"" which is also very realistic",o34eyh

h2ab3z3,Was that the Italian phrase or something else?,o34eyh
h2b7n88,Luca was a perfect blend of Porco Rosso and Ponyo,o34eyh
h2bapb0,The Ghibli comparison is no coincidence considering how open Enrico Casarosa has been about the influence of Miyazaki's films on Luca,o34eyh
h2c3ka3,"Agree. The Ghibli influence is strong in Luca, and I love how the film has a very whimsical and warm feel towards it.",o34eyh
h2eqw8a,"It made me remember those long, never ending summer days effing around with my friends. Making new friends on a whim, building cool shit, dipping in the lake, racing down the hill on bikes at very unsafe speeds. Made me very nostalgic.

Not many media does that so well. Some Myazaki movies, The Body, even King's IT. Now Luca goes on that list.",o34eyh
h2eci27,Check out the [Japanese trailer for Luca](https://youtu.be/eE_6HCwwlao). Very much gives off Ghibli vibes,o34eyh

h2b612f,They'd better arrange a private screening for Mr. Miyazaki himself or something..,o34eyh
h2hjekf,I agree. Perfect release time for fun summer movie. Fun movie and kids loved it. Saw their cousins today who watched it with us for our second watch and they just loved it too. I was thinking this would be a great start to summer flick every year in our household.,o34eyh
h2e7rfe,Alberto had massive daddy issues though. Glad that he found an adopted father by the end.,o34eyh
h2ea1m5,"Exactly, it‚Äôs probably the most optimistic Pixar movie. It has child abandonment‚Äîwhich was kinda depressing‚Äîbut otherwise is a heartwarming story about burgeoning relationships and being oneself. 

Really refreshing imo.",o34eyh
h3xcwk8,"I mean it's not that rare. Coco, Inside Out, The Incredibles (most other simply don't have the family involved) also have parents alive and pretty normal family conflicts (which are amped by the setting of the movie like the land of the dead or superheroes)",o34eyh
h2mgbiq,"i felt like Coco did everything this movie tried to do at least twice as well 4 years ago. i know that this movie wasn't trying to gun for any serious drama or anything but unless you're really into super lighthearted, low-stakes slice of life stuff I don't think this movie held up to previous pixar films at all.",o34eyh

h2qh78o,Perfect description,o34eyh
h2z9dl3,"It was also quite humorous, had surprisingly well developed characters that had loads of heart but different insecurities, had a wonderful alure of discovery in beauty of the world, and had some kinda light but empowering moments coping skill advocacy in the ""shut up, Bruno"" thematic focus. All in all, it felt well written and well developed. It also had a pretty clear cut, traditional goal, a satisfyingly snide and reprehensible villain, and a rather timeless heartfelt narrative dose of inclusivity. 

Honestly can't really think of any faults with the movie.",o34eyh
h2jlswe,Really? There‚Äôs a few dealerships by my house in Southern California.,o34eyh

h2ae6en,The first scene where Luca comes out the water literally looks like 2 animated characters added onto a real life scene.,o34eyh
h2bnr66,"Lived by the ocean my whole life and the water was STUNNING. They captured all of the different phases the water goes through in a day (when you are facing west). The flat blue look of the sun overhead at 10pm-noon [(X)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xv7LNxn1Pp8pAaLE8), the white capped twinkle of the surface late afternoon [(X)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2w7YGWkfFjVda2Wd8), and then the golden brilliant shimmer as the sun sets [(X)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5Sxkt9gvBxwWQpjV8).",o34eyh
h2aw6t4,I think I was more stunned by the volume of the pebbles on the beach,o34eyh
h2bgqml,"For me, it was the glasses. They looked like *real glasses.*",o34eyh
h2c1vco,"Yeah, I like when their animation ""feels"" real (depth of field, camera movements, realistic bubbles in the water) more than when it tries to *look* real. Photorealism can only get you so far, at least in a feature film. Luca looks fantastic but is still really stylized.",o34eyh
h2ao13i,This movie was so incredibly beautiful. But I don‚Äôt think anything has ever beat the water in Moana,o34eyh
h2asc16,"I thought the environments and scenery were really great in Raya, but found the character designs to be super underwhelming. Very generic.",o34eyh
h2i910f,"> Water is the hardest thing to animate and Disney has crushed it twice in a row now.

They did a great job but realistic water is not one of the hardest problems in computer animation. If you had to model its behavior completely accurately it might be but they kinda fake it in a way that makes it look awesome. Students in school do it as a project on a regular basis with great results. Obviously Pixar's is better but they are some of the best in the world at what they do and they have billions of dollars.",o34eyh
h32jbty,"Water isn't too hard anymore, the fluid motion can be physically simulated so much faster now, and the computer can do all the beautiful refraction effects for you.

h2bp3qr,And the dogs name was Nero,o34eyh
h2bag5r,"I assume their plan was just to grab him and run at that point, never too far from the water.",o34eyh
h2e73td,I think it‚Äôs one of those things where doing so justifies their fears even more. They put Luca? It‚Äôs the village‚Äôs fault.,o34eyh
h2mgnlz,"also they made a point to mention that his parents wouldnt look for him in the town, which i felt was a *really* reasonable premise, but that plot point was abandoned entirely. like the parents just showed up to town on the beach, stood around in town for multiple days splashing water on people, and beating up kids as if they knew for certain he was there. did i miss something?",o34eyh
h2b5u0e,"> It lowers the stakes even more when the parents don't seem bothered about people seeing him even though they were about to send him away for just being on the island with no one around. 

Not just that, but no one does *anything*. Parents throwing kids in water and just harassing them? Everyone's seemingly cool about this, acting as if it's typical.

Even Ercole - total jerk to everyone and people just accept it. I kept expecting him to sweet-talk the adults or show some charm to explain why no one does anything about his antics, but no, he's a jerk and everyone seemingly knows and accepts it. Actually made me like the movie a little less.",o34eyh
h2at6uk,"It‚Äôs believable that Luca would make a mistake like that because he‚Äôs a child,  kids make mistakes especially when they are in complicated setting with complexed emotions.",o34eyh
h2b3y2n,"I mean, Alberto outed himself to sabotage Luca's dreams. It's not like Luca pushed him in the water. Doesn't make what Luca did right, but they were both very much in the wrong. Alberto had every intention of making the girl hate Luca. He was putting both their lives in danger. 

Alberto did the backstabbing first because he was insecure.",o34eyh
h2c3xa9,"OMG yes! I thought about that when looking at the character designs for Luca, the soft and roundness look does give a stopmotion/claymation design and it's cute.",o34eyh

h2de62h,And then he basically adopted him üò≠,o34eyh

h2mh99e,"i thought there was going to be some other twist as well, like it was obvious he was an orphan but that was it??? what made him like human stuff so much? what made him want to explore the world? what made him so willing to make things up and lie? i felt like he was such a complex character with a lot of characterization and we literally never get any further insight than ""yeah he's an orphan that's why"". it felt like they cut multiple flashbacks entirely",o34eyh
h2bhnfx,"I was underwhelmed by Soul, personally. I felt it had a lot of missed opportunities. Why do a movie about a man who loves jazz and then not have a jazzy soundtrack? Trent Resnor scored the film 

I also felt its emotional core lacked much punch for a movie about being passionate about things in life. The scene where ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù tells his mom how important music is to him is good but I felt they never really explored their central themes as much as I‚Äôd have liked",o34eyh

h2flq0l,"It was shocking, but Alberto basically tried to ""out"" Luca without his consent. Without any warning, which is a super uncool thing to do to someone. Especially in a town where you get harpooned for being a sea monster...",o34eyh
h2e53jy,What hurt the most was Alberto still cares enough to not out Luca despite the betrayal.,o34eyh
h2b6v65,Everyone in our room gasped when that happened.,o34eyh
h3lbox2,Same. I gasped and was so shocked.,o34eyh
h2d6p6g,"It was refreshing I agree. He was just a douche and nothing more than that. 

The voice actor did a great job and he was animated really well. He has these mannerisms which make you wanna punch him in the face but he's still funny to watch. Like his posture when riding the bike lol.",o34eyh
h2e0q0o,"I thought Soul was fantastic too. Next to Inside Out, I found Soul to be one of their most interesting themes.",o34eyh
htgqz7n,Yeah but imo Alberto was also being a huge dick. He was jealous that his man was getting attention from someone else amd was being douchey. I think it was fair for Luca to be like hey yous a bitch,o34eyh
h2b64hm,"Alberto is trying to out Luca because he's insecure at how his friend is adapting to life on land. *That's* the major betrayal here, that Alberto is supposed to be supporting his friend and sharing their secret, and instead he's destroying it.

There's a pattern of Alberto pushing Luca to overcome his fears, often without fully getting his consent, and Luca might need and benefit from that - **but this scene ain't that**. This is Alberto feeling like his friend is developing a life separate from his own, and as a result trying to sever his ties to that life.

Many others have talked about the queer coding in the film - within that framework, this is the equivalent of trying to force someone who isn't ready out of the closet. Alberto is trying to take control of a huge part of Luca's identity and use it not to actually help support him but to take away everything he has wanted. Alberto is essentially doing the same thing to Luca that his parents were doing - trying to isolate him and take away his independence - but without even the excuse of it being for his safety that the parents have, solely out of spite.

Luca's turn is harsh, which is why it hits so hard, but totally reasonable. How can you blame someone who isn't ready to lose everything for refusing to let you destroy their identity and ruin all your goals and dreams just because they'd rather control you than risk losing you? Yes, we know that in the end acceptance is possible, but Luca doesn't have any reason to believe this - if there was reason to suspect they would be accepted, you could argue Alberto is once again pushing Luca to overcome his fears, but even Alberto doesn't believe that. In fact, he's actively *hoping* that the town rejects them so Luca is forced back with him. Frankly, if Luca wasn't already such a strong character and if he wasn't so immediately willing to rebuild their relationship, it would make *Alberto* seem like a very toxic and unlikable character, in my opinion.",o34eyh
h2b8q2s,"Why do you think that?  What Luca did was harsh but it was understandable if you put yourself in his shoes. He either betrays his friend or reveals himself as a sea monster and potentially loses the chance of ever having a life outside of the water. 

You could argue that it was actually Alberto that betrays Luca. Whether it be jealousy or genuine concern about Luca, he betrays their trust and forces him into a corner. His apprehension is somewhat warranted though, so I don't think it made his character unlikeable either.",o34eyh
h2aad0q,Please tell me why you disagree Einstein of downvoting,o34eyh
h4rt6qc,what‚Äôs it about?,o34eyh
h2ckelj,"Yeah. They stilled wanted to get them, it was only after the Dad king of glared at them did they chill. It wasn't even like they just accepted them, they more just shrugged in a ""It ain't worth it."" way.",o34eyh

With a burning platonic passion. The notion that boys don't or that it immediately makes them gay is just toxic. Who *doesn't* love their friends? The movie was very good in showing such a relationship.

I didn't read the movie as coded beyond a very general 'outsider' thing. Now if that makes you seen, wether you're gay, or sit in a wheelchair, or just immigrated to a new country, or are a minority in your society in general, it doesn't matter. If you see yourself as understood by this movie... well, that's nice, isn't it? Everyone likes to feel understood.",o34eyh
h2avscc,"The director has already said too that they very specifically avoided having anything romantic. They wanted it to be about friendship overall. Alberto is named after his childhood best friend. 

He‚Äôs also said he wants it to be a message for anyone who feels like they don‚Äôt belong, and the idea of accepting yourself first. I like that, LGBTQ+ folks and all kinds of outsiders can relate here.",o34eyh
h2aasyn,A great post. I think we‚Äôre on a similar wavelength with it. Toxic masculinity is an interesting lens to view the film too because Massimo is a very typically masculine guy who is in absolutely no way toxic. Ercole is an extremely toxic person who isn‚Äôt very masculine. I hope as many people as possible get to see Luca and get to take away whatever positive message and representation they need from it.,o34eyh
h2jekvh,"> I think Luca and Alberto love each other in a very non-romantic way and we all sometimes forget that boys can be close and have strong bonds to each other without being queer.

I agree. I was surprised in another thread that someone felt this was a ""coming out"" story and checked this thread to see other points of view and check if I was just missing the obvious. 

When I watched it I felt it was one of those odes to 10-12 year old friendships which are not romantic or sexual and yet can be filled with tenderness and love in a way that creates a special kind of nostalgia for that time period when you get older. The 80's used to traffic heavily in that sort of movie and it's sadly disappeared from pop culture.

I'm glad at least my read on the movie wasn't alone.",o34eyh
h2d0ym8,"You can read it very strongly as both ways that it's a refreshing movie where you have two male best friends who care about each other in a healthy, platonic, non-toxic way. And you can read it as a queer coded film where the othering of ""sea monsters"" and the themes of acceptance very clearly have this message. Massimo's line at the end even underlines that point where he says ""‚ÄúSome people, they will never accept him, but some will."" and that fits gay relationships so well.",o34eyh
h2df6o2,"The way I feel about it is that it encapsulates the inflection point of adolescent relationships as they mature into teenage/adult relationships. I happen to have had Stand By Me on the brain all day before watching this and it is the absolute perfect reference - Stand By Me is one perfect amazing summer for a group of boys, and at the ending Wil Wheaton/Richard Dreyfus talks about how soon the other boys were just ""a face in the hall"", it was one brief moment where they had the independence to hang out alone but without the distractions of girls or jobs, etc.

And on one level, Luca is the same for Luca and Alberto. Guilia and/or school represent these longer term desires for Luca, while Alberto is more concerned with extending this perfect summer. On another level, you can pretty easily swap those out for a romantic relationship to explain some of the emotional tension, but it's neither necessary nor explicit.",o34eyh
h2axps9,"I know the director didn't intend for it to be taken like that, but I do see a lot of queer-coding in the story.

Luca's parents sending someone (his uncle) to talk to him and then sending him away so that he's not near the temptation (of the surface). Was almost too close to conversion therapy, since he was meant to be sent deep as far away from the surface as possible. 

Also that moment when Luca ""betrays"" Alberto was too similar to so many other movies/show from queer storylines where one person from the relationship outs the other so that people don't think they're gay.

And when the bad guy talks about how he fears them and how the whole town fears them, or when the mom talks about how he won't be accepted by everyone in the world, but will by some people.

I don't know, it can be interpreted many ways (even racially too with white-passing PoCs perspective). At the end of the day, the story is about their friendship, and the movie does not explicitly present them as gay which means they don't count as ""representation"" for me. But I will say that I took a lot of the themes and storylines in the movie from a queer perspective and I'm hoping a queer interpretation of the movie won't just be dismissed because of the whole ""why can't guys be friends without being gay"" thing.",o34eyh
h2g64oe,"> I think Luca and Alberto love each other in a very non-romantic way and we all sometimes forget that boys can be close and have strong bonds to each other without being queer.

My take away was it was less about the two of them having a romantic connection, but more that being a ""sea monster"" translated to being different, hated, unaccepted, misunderstood, etc.",o34eyh
h2cu6lp,See I think when people say this is a LGBT story there‚Äôs a tendency to assume that means romance. To me this is 100% a coming out story. It‚Äôs queer in that it‚Äôs about that time in any LGBT person‚Äôs life where they start to accept what they are. They chose to keep this vague enough so you can project any sort of ‚Äúdifference‚Äù onto the story but the LGBT allegory does fit best with those themes.,o34eyh
h2baqk7,"The real queer representation were the two old monster ladies who decided to spend a life together on the surface üòâ

I also don't think Luca and Alberto are a thing, but that scene when Alberto revealed his identity and Luca ""betrayed"" him to protect himself strongly reminded me of how queer kids often point fingers at other, more obviously queer kids to divert attention from themselves in an act of self-preservation.

And even that small scene at the end when those two ladies were like ""fuck it"" and revealed themselves to be sea monsters, after which the village women also went ""fuck it"" and tore down the poster. It shows that when people who are already known and respected in a given community turn out be queer (or different in any other way), the community is strongly pushed towards acceptance since stigmatization is kinda impossible at this point.

There's more to being queer than romance, and if you look beyond it you can actually notice many little things that hit close to home. They did for me at least.",o34eyh
h2h1tf3,"At the end you see two old ladies, who have only ever been seen with each other, come out and reveal themselves as sea monsters

h2aftp2,"Very well put.

I think that the film reinforces the reality that people struggle with identity, period. That issue is not unique to to LGBTQ+ by any means, but seeing representation that people from any walk of life can identify with just shows that we are all human (and maybe sea monsters).",o34eyh

h2ig7zr,"Going into it, especially with the ""Call Me By The Shape of Water"" memes that floated around a bit when the first trailers dropped, I was prepared for there to be some winks and nods towards queer relationships, or coming out, etc.  And while I think the film, yes, _can_ be interpreted in that sense of being who you are, I was really surprised by how little sense of queercoding there was.  It really is a very platonic movie about very good friends, without as you say, the toxic masculinity.  A very good example of _actual_ platonic male friendship.",o34eyh
h2ardu9,"Thank you for this comment.

I‚Äôm a straight dude and I‚Äôd love to see more (at least more than zero!?) LGBTQ+ representation in these sort of films, but I really like your thoughts.

If my wife and I have children, I am excited to break the chain. Let‚Äôs talk about our feelings. Let‚Äôs not be afraid to cry. Let‚Äôs show affection to those that we care about. 

I can see where people are thinking it‚Äôs coded. I‚Äôm happy with people seeing what they want to see, I guess.

h3nkpkd,"Straight guy with a pan wife. This was definitely a queer movie. One kid is abandoned by his dad, the other is a runaway from parents who wanted to send him away. They have their ""heaven on the beach"" scene. They fight about coming out to society and want to run away together around the Mediterranean on a Vespa. They get help from and live with a friend with a father who was ""born this way"" and no longer is married to his still living ex-wife. There's a betrayal scene where he outs his friend without outing himself and a later coming together and outing of both of them at the climax. The villain is a bigot who doesn't learn a lesson because he's a bigot and he gets trashed while the unaccepting people learned to be accepting, so they weren't villains, and two old women come out when society becomes accepting. On top of it, there's the factor of him being attracted to a girl and the complications that causes for them, approaching the bi issue, while it's literally a movie about transformation, giving trans representation. Plus the fishing themes, which are common in stories with homoerotic undertones. And it came out during Pride. They're pretty in your face with it, which is awesome, but also a sign of a kid's film in that it's not either more subtle and complex or more explicit in its subject matter.

h2a2qqj,"You‚Äôre repeating this on every comment that alludes to LGBTQ+ themes, but that isn‚Äôt really what the director said. Yes, Luca and Alberto are platonic friends and the story is not about their romantic love for each other. The metaphor of being an outsider who has to hide their true self is just intentionally left broad, though it has obvious ties to LGBTQ+ themes. The movie uses several tropes common to stories about coming out and finding acceptance within your community. It isn‚Äôt that they weren‚Äôt aiming for LGBTQ+ themes, they just didn‚Äôt want it to be that limited in scope.

The director takes offense to the idea that the boys must be romantically involved, that they can‚Äôt just be intimate friends. That‚Äôs fair, and even as someone who sees the LGBTQ+ themes I can openly appreciate that Luca and Alberto are just platonic friends. I agree that we should be able to appreciate their relationship for what it is. That‚Äôs progressive in its own way and only adds layers to the film.

I personally see the LGBTQ+ themes more in their having to hide their true identities than their feelings for one another. The desire to find freedom and acceptance. The lesson that even if some people will never accept you, you can still find the good ones who will. Obviously none of that is specific to a story about coming out, but those themes are very commonly featured in those types of stories and this movie handles those themes differently than any other Disney property.",o34eyh
h29x1p0,"I definitely understand, and I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not an LGBT specific story by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a story about wanting to get out of your life, find freedom, find like-minded/good individuals who accept you, and to make your own way. Luca isn‚Äôt a gay story, but it is a story that shares its themes with the LGBTQIA+ experience. That much is undeniable.  
It shares themes with stories of differently abled individuals, and anyone who has ever felt the struggle to be accepted. And I think it‚Äôs wonderful.",o34eyh

Nobody in the village ever said anything about *hating* sea monsters per se, it was just a local legend about something potentially dangerous that was suddenly seeming more real and people were panicking. Even Ercole, at the end when the boys stand up to him and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not afraid of you‚Äù responds by saying ‚ÄúNo, but we‚Äôre afraid of you.‚Äù And the only reason he was so aggressive about it was out of greed for the prize money/attention for being the one to find the sea monster, and then when he found out it was the kids he already hated for trying to stand up to him, that‚Äôs where the hate came from. The townspeople stood down when Massimo vouched for them because they were begrudgingly accepting that the boys obviously weren‚Äôt dangerous.

the second is more interesting...its no secret that certain people where excited to hear the two guys might be gay, but what if they really werent and never were supposed to be? perhaps the women at the end both being women was merely coincidence

HOWEVER, since everybody agrees that this was the theme of the film, can we *please* cut Pixar and Disney a little slack here? It just annoys me that everybody praises the message and then in the same sentence, rants about how Disney's ""homophobia"" prevented Luca and Alberto from kissing, when the director said that wasn't the intention. You haven't done this, but there are **plenty** of people on Twitter who think they were intended to be a couple until the Big Bad Mouse^(TM) intervened.

Rt is a complete scam and basically a marketing tool at this point but it still has worth to see what critics are being paid to say haha but  within the users comments once you've sifted  the paid shills , bots and trolls there are real reviews by real people.  Often those are the reviews which are worth reading.

And most of those reviews fell in line with my view point that luca is an average film and so dissapointing for pixar.  

I liked luca enough to be frustrated that it didn't tackle more meaningful subject matter and came across as a fun competent but around average fish out of water (excuse pun ;).

Ultimately maybe this issue is that despite the more mature discussion around lgbt+ content , as this year Disney have included lgbt in everything from the owl house to jingle cruise to the last dragon to luca. ...That luca is like cars 2.  

Cars 2 is a fun film but average movie aimed at kids (and merchadise) missing that pixar magic balance of appealing to young and old alike.

 Luca has little for adults to enjoy imo and that's fine. But as an adult that doesn't leave me much while a film like onward or soul left me plenty.  

Furthermore for those that say its a ghibli homage...sadly outside of some visual familiarity exist, luca is nothing like Ghibli becasue it has no real message of worth. 

If it was a ghibli film the issue of man polluting the seas would have been greatly expanded and the ending would have touched upon that issue. Instead we get  the disney magic of everyone just stops being bigots and loves anyone different because of....a bike race?  

Sloppy simplistic writing for children (and parents) who don't think to hard. If it was ghibli  we would have seen a Ponyo like commentary on man's polluting of the oceans and how it effects those who live within.  And it do that while still being a children's film with fun for all ages.

This is because ghibli was 2 men then 1 and both were activists. While pixar isn't even John Handsy Lassiter anymore. It's just another part of an evil Corp and churns out the stories (propaganda?) which falls in line with Disney's shareholders ideals.

Girolamo has ""giro"" (loop) in it, so you see him shake the hand and make a circle.

Trombetta means trumpet, so he then pulls the hand as if he were playing one.

It's actually a real thing, they don't say it where I'm from, but i know my gf's dad did it and he's from Tuscany. He actually said ""Girolamo seghetta"", seghetta meaning little saw, so the gestures is the same, but it continues with something else I can't remember.",o34eyh

Danny Saunders, the other protagonist, is a brilliant Hasid with a photographic memory and a passion for psychoanalysis. Danny is the son of Reb Saunders, the pious and revered head of a great Hasidic dynasty.

I don't think that interpretation should be dismissed. I mean the movie is about being true to your friends and therefore yourself, having courage about it, that's broadly interpretable to all kinds of experiences. I don't see why it wouldn't be or shouldn't be to the queer perspective. 

But they are pre-teens, and it's meant to represent I think that special kind of pre-teen friendship, which can be tender, intense, involve profound tests of loyalty and trust, but contain no romantic element, no sexual elements.

In otherwords Luca and Alberto might be gay or POC or whatever you want to interpret them, but I do disagree with romanticizing/sexualizing their relationship.",o34eyh
h53v9kf,"> At the end of the day, the story is about their friendship, and the movie does not explicitly present them as gay which means they don't count as ""representation"" for me.

Fellow Gay man here, so I get what you mean. I do fully support the more kind of hidden analogies (literally the only thing missing was a kiss before going onto the train).

The reason I support subtleish movies is because it tricks people into being more open minded and thinking about things in a different way. It reminds me of the Xmen and how it was a way to potray racism in a different light in order to get people to be more opened minded. If the movie had been a 100% gay movie, alot of parents would not let their children see it. But this way the message of acceptance is put out.",o34eyh

The ‚Äúgay awakening‚Äù can also be explained as coming out of your shell when you meet a push you off a cliff friend (this is exactly how they created Alberto to be, the director uses the term push you off a cliff friend and named the character after his childhood best friend.)

Ultimately, it was portrayed in an entirely inoffensive way but managed to still tell a compelling story that easily resonates with LGBTQ+ youth - as well as any person who feels like an outsider.

Then you get the girl character and Luca realizes he‚Äôs bi, he rejects his ‚Äúgay‚Äù side, pushes Alberto away, then re-embraces his gay side and takes him back. Then they have a literal coming out scene that ends in the homophobic character getting beat up for being homophobic. To follow that up we get a scene with the only other sea monsters that live in the town being the two old lesbians. To take this further the credits show Luca‚Äôs grandma with these two lesbians and then Luca and Alberto to show that she was bi herself and curious and had spent time with them and recognized the same in Luca hence why she pushed him so that he could be happy like she was.

You also have the only colorful characters in the whole thing being the sea monsters and they‚Äôre literally rainbow colored to represent the LGBTQ rainbow used for pride.

h31rtaq,"Well I don't think both of the movies were trying to tackle the same ideas at all, so it was mostly a general comparison of parts. I thought that Coco did a much better job of exploring a non-American culture, where it's story is deeply connected to multiple facets of Mexican music, art, history, and mythology. I am *deeply* in love with Coco and its strong commitment to this, and Luca doesn't measure up to it at all in this sense, often using Italian culture as punchlines or jokes (the bad guy being a really awkward caricature that's played for comedy, the dozens of cheese references that nobody in Italy uses, etc.) instead of an opportunity to learn or understand something unique about their culture. Coco definitely had its fair share of silly moments and one-beat references (Dante the Xolo dog being the comedy relief is proably the biggest offender) but none of them really came at the expense of culture or rubbed me the wrong way like limiting italian accents to only the villain characters or saying ""santa mozzarella"" fifty times did.

(spoilers for Coco don't read ahead) 

I also think every part of Coco's characters and plot seems much more deliberate and tightly written than anything in Luca. I don't think it would be too surprising to compare both of the films first and final acts as they feel like beat-for-beat copies. Kid wants to do something his family doesn't like, family learns that he's doing it and forces him not to do it anymore in a severe overreaction, Kid runs away to explore his desires, family chases him down to get him home, and both movies end with the family coming to terms with and accepting the way their child is different.

However, I don't think Luca does even a single part of this story better than Coco. Miguel *explains* why he loves music (the prime drive of both the conflict and the heart of the story) so much in both narration and subtext. ([Much Needed Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WaDqskareU) is one of my favorite scenes in any pixar movie, it's just so simple and beautiful and its importance to the story is conveyed without a single word from Miguel). Luca wants to explore the human world... for no reason? basically he's just curious because he sees some cool shiny trinkets. he has no background, no motivations, no personal connection to the human world at all. it's incredibly arbitrary that he even goes to the surface in the first place, which makes his parents' overreaction moment even more arbitrary. both families overreact to something that clearly isn't an issue in the rest of their society, but at least Coco gives a reason (Hector leaving Imelda and not returning). we don't witness a *single* bad thing that humans do to fish monsters, it's all told in a non-specific way and not shown.

the buildup to the resolution in Luca is also really sloppy compared to Coco. There are ZERO moments building up to the ""family comes to terms with their child"" story beat in Luca while there are several in Coco. every scene with the parents in Luca is a joke until the very end when they're needed to wrap up that story thread, where they suddenly no longer fear the murdering/dangerous humans because their kid won a triathlon and wasn't immediately lynched. their acceptance of Luca's curiosity for human society is extremely abrupt and not earned in any logical or an emotional sense. like, people KILL monsters in this universe, right? and they're okay sending him off to school on his own? are you serious? In Coco, we have [Imelda and Miguel in the alleyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyXoRrYuZAE), [Hector's truth being revealed to Imelda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmU5lex1NrE), [Imelda beginning to subconsciously forgive Hector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbpvvFU1P8s), and the climax, [an entire musical number IN SPANISH where Imelda embraces the change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAYUQ1ltJj0). and THEN he does it AGAIN in a different way with his living family with [the best scene in Pixar history (in my opinion)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0azOIk0Kvg) and [the credit song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLkDCF_EbqI). I can't understate how vast my impression of the two movies' endings is. I don't think Luca's is bad because it's simple. I think it's just careless and sloppy. You also get ALL of this content from Hector's side (and his relationship with De La Cruz, Imelda, and Coco) as well, so every scene is working double time on multiple thematic and plot fronts. In Luca, Alberto is barely a character. Everything we learn about him is explicitly told, but we see none of it. Giulia is a lot of fun and is by far my favorite part of the movie, but she doesn't go through any development.

As a side note, Luca had a stunning lack of memorable music. There were several scenes that barely had any music at all that REALLY should have had something there? Like the first time Luca tries to leave the water on his own and is struggling against the surface of the water around 11:30 into the movie, why is there only the same background underwater ambiance playing? I felt like this was supposed to be an emotional moment but the timing and pacing of this scene combined with the lack of music made it honestly seem unfinished.

I don't think Luca is a bad movie, I just don't think it really cares about its story at all. If you're into a lighter movie and kinda want to turn your brain off in a kids movie sense, Luca is great! But I feel that Pixar is *known* for making family movies that are incredibly entertaining and moving for people of all ages while *still* containing that subtext and themes that adults can really grip into. Luca is strictly a lighthearted kids movie with nothing else really going on. I really like the LGBT subtext in Luca and would not be surprised to hear in a few years that having to cut out those ideas from the script heavily damaged the writing and production process, but if you're to believe the director that the LGBT subtext wasn't intended, my impression of the movie drops even further. I learned nothing about Italy that isn't already commonly referenced in America (hehe pasta hehe cheese hehe moustache). the animation is really good and really cute, and the characters are *fine*, but it's all so surface level. the only way I can perceive any part of Luca being higher quality than Coco is if you *really* don't care about writing to notice it at all or don't really care about learning new things about cultures and just like cutesy animation. to me, it very clearly falls short in writing, characters, plot, themes, and music (and I would argue animation as well). 

Side note: I don't think every movie set in a foreign country has to be about that country's culture, but I felt like the advertisement for this movie really put it's setting at its forefront. I also think that Coco really fucked over Pixar from this perspective, because I thought the cultural representation was incredible in that film and *not* doing that for future movies feels like a step back or laziness when it probably was incredibly difficult to make a film like Coco. But even then I still felt like this movie didn't really put any effort into that kind of thing at all.

I'm not a kid anymore so I don't know if kids liked it more than Coco (I assume they might because the animation is a lot more goofy and overstated), so this is all coming from an adult point of view. I would not be surprised to hear that adults watch this movie more than Coco because their kids want to see it more often.",o34eyh

On the other hand, they had this fear of sea monsters; unknown creatures who will snatch away their kids. They don't really know much about these monsters as all their pictures are blurry and their stories are leaky. 

So when luca and Alberto get outed at the end, and they see a clash between two viewpoints they have to make a decision. They just saw moments ago two monsters help a human girl, the same monsters who all week we're prancing about happily across town safe and normal. 

The movie has some holes in it and I think some parts could have been reworked to flesh this point out, but Disney is still afraid of being to out there so I doubt they'd have done that anyway. The point wasn't an inexplicable change in the townspeople, it was a reality clash.

I really liked how Onward dealt with the ideas of dealing with loss and I love how Soul actually went in a completely adult direction by dealing with stuff like finding your purpose in life. Of course Soul has such mature themes I can easily see it not doing well with kids and even Onward gets a bit heavy at times which I guess might not be great for kids.

h7atzdd,"I think few will argue it's bad. Its just a pixar average film for kids like cars 2.  Is it better than the equally challenging (or not so being the point) Onwards.

I think onwards was more problematic as a film as it has pacing issues but ultimately has much more of a genuine message and heart then luca. Luca is very competent but by the numbers forgettable beyond the lovely scenery.  

The rt score terrifies me becasue despite the critic score not nec reflecting the actual scores dye to the rt system..the audience scores are too high. And to the average person (possibly as intended by who ever rigs this shit) luca seems like the majoirty consider it the best animation ever made  and a modern masterpiece.  

It's nearer to a piece of shit than it is a masterpiece but only because that comparison is so insane. It's just an average fun nice film for kids.  

But that rt score genuinely underlines how flawed that system is and why rt should never be the go to site for a film review.  

We needed Imdb to not be another shill  farm and act as a rival balance but those days are long gone now. Then only way to know if a film is worth your time beyond watching it...is to find a pateon site you trust and hope they cover it :?",o34eyh
h7s8bni,Cant we? You're correct on 1 level but also no we should expect everything from average people as there are no average people.  If we  the majoirty can't  reach within themselves for their better selves then they only deserve the trash the minority elite shovel their way.,o34eyh

It's a positive step forward i guess but it's only half hearted while Disney tv shows like the owl house have more committed lgbt+ characters.

Beyond that lgbt+ is part of every aspect of life so either a film or animation acknowledges that in some capacity or it censors it as has been the case for ..well ever.  Even the ow house and luca had to be consored and or banned and or vetted for lbgt+ content in countries like China , middle East and some European.

If you want to know more about luca and lgbt+ then Google has countless articles on this and with the actors etc. Also disneys Raya main character is a lesbian apparently according to the actress who plays her so clearly there is a concerted effort in the West to update our entertainment to reflect the real world where recent studies indicate that atleast 10% of the UK population is lgbt+.",o34eyh

I also don‚Äôt dislike Arlo either, in fact I like him a lot. But in fiction a lot of times the nervous/scared character is completely terrified of everything, like he was in that movie (or at least the beginning).
But in THIS movie, they had a character who was nervous/anxious but ALSO wanted to try new things and didn‚Äôt need to be pushed too hard to get out of their comfort zone.

For people who grow up in an oppressive religion that denies them basic freedoms, ‚Äòchoosing‚Äô to continue to perpetuate a cycle they don‚Äôt believe in and know is wrong isn‚Äôt really a choice either.  It would also be hiding who they truly are.  If we were to take the movie too literally, even any LGBTQ+ message would start to fall apart.

And that moment totally happens in other scenarios too - it‚Äôs certainly not exclusive to coming out. I know someone who went through a similar ‚Äôouting‚Äô process while leaving Islam, for example, and was then disowned by their family and found a new one.  Their parents even had the religious leader come and visit to persuade them otherwise.  It fits the metaphors of this movie so incredibly well it‚Äôs almost uncanny, and it‚Äôs why the example immediately came to mind in my first comment.

I disagree with that partly.  And saw one of the actors talking about their interpretation so again as Disney gets cold feet due to China and alt right (who both persecute lgbt) they likely kept it all undecided.

As an lgbt+ person i def see this and last dragon as films with lgbt+ characters and elements much more so than ever before. But that's because Disney is finally making a conservative effort to represent real life and real people which include children in its content. 

We see this with the owl house , jungle cruise , the last dragon and luca.  Previous years we saw little or nothing. That's how you know it's different. **Nothing...Then something. Denial...and then partial acceptance**. Trust me it's real to people who are forced to see these things haha

The age group of the children is more than old enough to make the writers comment you stated absolute nonsense.  Ofcourse anything can and often should be just about friendship and not romance (or later sexual) feelings but again the reality is all romance start with either sex or friendship or both.  

In luca there is an overt and clear attempt at showing that it's ok for boys to be very close even as they become teens. It's ok to show they have emotions , can cry and be vulnerable. 

If we contrast this to children's content in the 80s where none of that is remotely mainstream and you'd see kids beating up other kids while shouting ""fag"" and ""homo"". It be important to content creators to include rhis negativity as much as it would to have zero ambiguity in the sexuality of yes even children. Usually achieved by a kiss with an older girl and or looking at gender appropriate porn or overt sexual comments about the opposite sex (even by kids).

Fortunately for all that content is no longer mainstream but in the 90s and 00s we only had implied or nothing lgbt+ content or mishandled attempts to represent day to day life. But now in the 2020s we finally have more complex honest relationships in films. 
Sometimes lgbt+ and Sometiems not.  

The important issue is that it is more difficult now for companies like Disney to get away with saying in meetings  *'these two boys can't be too close as we don't want anyone to think they're gay'* is progress. That's literally how it used to be (still is at times).

  So in the case of luca is there a romance between two boys? Yes but its 1 sided and a story of unrequited love (nit sex) where one feels friendship but the other wants more (we don't know what) and ultimately 1 boy goes after the girl and leave the other behind. 

But I'll contextualize this as I did in my review that this is the typical Disney get out of jail free card.  Becasue they're not human boys...who have human emotions. They're fish. 

They're merpeople. We don't know what sex or gender is like with fish but it's likely like fish fluid and they don't label crap or worry.  So two fish merboys being in love might be normal and problem free even in the 50s italy where being gay was not ok at all.  

Its the ambiguity of the writing which makes this a fun kids film with some progressive elements but nothing more.  This is why the film is only mediocre and not a masterpiece ... because it fails to address the themes within in a meaningful way (but Disney still cashed in on the positive pr lol).",o34eyh

It's also extra fucked that this came out during Pride month when Disney is selling $40 rainbow Mickey Mouse shirts and shit. They only support the LGBTQ community when it's profitable for them and that's really not okay.

Actual film content wise I also really disliked how *far* it went at times with some of its pretty overt homages to other coming out stories.

> working really hard to pass as a different race (think Rachel Dolezal)

I would really not use Rachel as an example, she is a somthing else. But even if we did, she was never being outed by a fellow transrace person. The whole point of the scene is that they both were ""Monsters"" in the closet, Alberto was coming out to show they wouldnt be accepted, in order for the Giulia not to think that Luca was also a ""Monster"" he makes sure to make a big deal out of Alberto including alerting everyone around them that would not have found out otherwise.  Please show me one example of a transPOC outing another transPOC. 

> Eminem's character in the movie 8 Mile? He ""outs"" his rival as not being from Detroit and having gone to a private school.

Did Eminem also go to a private school? The point was that it was a fellow ""monster"" outing another ""Monster"".

> kids who have hobbies that aren't socially acceptable

This one is plausible, but its a complete streatch. Can you give a real life example for this where the  outie and the outer are both in the hobby?

> people who are joining, or leaving, religious groups. 

This example is the only one that holds some weight. I can definitely see an atheist outing another atheist in order to save face. 

The examples you gave either are not equivalent to the scene or just so so unlikely. So for this scene it basically has like a 90% chance of being a gay metaphor, 10% of other. Good thing is that this scene is not the only one in the movie. When added to the other scence in the film that imply a LGBTQA+ allegory, then the answer is that this movie is a queer allegory. Yes some things can apply to other situations, but all the scenes apply heavily to queer themes. 

Lastly, in order to say this movie isn't basically a coming out movie, the argument has to be that it is just a coincidence that every scene fits perfectly in a gay movie.",o34eyh

So saying specific scenes are meant to mean certain things is where I disagree, because we know the intention. Saying specific scenes makes you feel a certain way that is specific to the you is where I agree. 

I self inserted with my best friend since kindergarten who I now live across the country from. We both had pretty terrible home lives and neither one of us felt like we belonged.

h2b6fxj,"Well surprisingly, I‚Äôm straight, so I have some experience. When I was young, about the characters age actually, I was an outcast with the one friend I had. We were bullied for the things we liked, who our families were (we were poor but our moms worked at the private school so we got to go there for elementary), and idk a bunch of other mean kid things. When we went to a new school for middle school I tried a lot harder to fit in. People actually liked me and were interested in me. The entire time I was terrified they‚Äôd find me out and the bullying would start all over again. I tried to act like a different person. My friend did too. It wasn‚Äôt until college I started accepting myself and finding the good ones who liked me for me. I‚Äôm sure this is not an uncommon story for a lot of people. 

Shit even as an adult watching it this helped me a little with stuff I‚Äôm dealing with. Imposter syndrome at work is real and every day I feel like someone is gonna notice I feel out of my depth every day. This helped me look at that problem in a new way. 

See how even though this story isn‚Äôt literally about me and my friend growing up, I can self insert and make it about that FOR ME. Without trying to tell people they CANT relate to it for their reasons.

Again from the people who told the story 

>‚ÄúWe hope that ‚Äòsea monster‚Äô may very well be a metaphor for all [manners] of feeling completely different ‚Äî like being a teen or a preteen ‚Äî any second the place you‚Äôre feeling odd.

I went to see a chick flick in a movie theater by myself when I was in middle school, I was terrified that someone would see me and laugh at me.  I ran into some girls from school, they laughed.

These examples might not have the same magnitude of being outed sexually, but being ""outed"" is a pretty universal experience.

Voice dubbing an *existing* film is a very specialized, difficult skill. You have to match a new script to already created animation. It's not something all actors are great at, and I don't think it's a black mark against those who can't. (A lot of professional voice actors frankly aren't that good at it either.) It's not like most of the Ghibli films were made that way in the first place, and same with Disney films today. (They record first, or at least early in the process, and create or tweak the animation accordingly.)

You also run into the problem, especially with the Disney dubs, that they add all sorts of dumb dialogue (they seem to be afraid of silence) and change characterizations, possibly to Americanize the cast. For example Castle in the Sky ‚Äî which is a lovely film ‚Äî falls prey to this, which is a shame because it actually has some great voice actors like Mark Hamill onboard. They just wrecked poor Pazu.

Bonus positivity: the Hollywood dub they did for the Cat Returns is legitimately fantastic. I was extremely impressed. Anne Hathaway especially is great.

You do know that if any of the writers or directors said it was a gay allegory then China and India would basically ban the film. China has the biggest movie market.  So any comments they make about the ""meaning"" of it are worth a grain of salt. 

> I've conceded that their point is valid, it's just not the only point.

From an analytic point of view, it is the main point of the movie. A coming out story. 

> It's a kids movie
 
Doesnt matter if its for kids or adults


> people many different kinds of people find relatable, queer and otherwise.

I find relatable stuff in a number of black movies that does not mean that the black movie is a gay movie. 

  Let me show you a real life example. The x-men. The show was about mutants, but the allegory was about the civil rights movement Did the comics straight out say this is a black civil rights story. No, they did not. It was there none the less for anyone to find if they knew what to look for.  As Stan Lee said 

> ‚ÄùIt not only made them different, but it was a good metaphor for what was happening with the Civil Rights Movement in the country at that time.‚Äù

But even without confirmation, you can make direct correlactions with the civil rights era. That metaphor extended to the characters themselves, with Professor X and his vision of harmonious human-mutant coexistence standing in for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., while Magneto‚Äôs rigid attitude toward the defense of mutantkind reflected the philosophy of Malcolm X. The Sentinels, a brand of massive mutant-hunting robot, were introduced two years later as readers watched on TV as black Americans were beaten and abused by white police officers.

I am ""obsessed"" with this being a gay coming to term with oneself movie the same way I am ""obsessed"" that the xmen was a civil rights allegory.",o34eyh

h75x0tl,"lol you‚Äôre high if you think Vespa was looking to make some money selling scooters to American children thru Luca. VESPAS=1950s Italian culture. MUSTANGS=1960s American culture and if the movie was set in 1960s America and the kids were wanting a Mustang no one would be crying that Ford is going crazy with children‚Äôs movie product placement. Use your brain. The Vespa was a plot device that fit in the setting of the movie. It wasn‚Äôt to make money whether they had a deal or not. More than likely the writers were writing the movie and someone suggested the child characters work towards the goal of having a VESPA (because the movie is set in 1950s Italy) and everyone went ‚Äúthat‚Äôs gold, Jerry!‚Äù and then they finished writing, approached Vespa for permission to use their likeness, and Vespa said ‚Äúfuck yes free publicity and I love PIXAR‚Äù and the rest is history.

Also, you realize that the point of product placement is to support the productions budget. If I don‚Äôt have enough money then I‚Äôll approach a company and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll advertise your product for a fee‚Äù and then more than likely use that money towards the production budget. Disney is worth billions upon billions upon billions. They have so much fucking money it‚Äôs insane. They don‚Äôt need pennies from Vespa to help.

this isnt even about this specific film. Luca is a story that is meaningful to both LGBT people and straight people. but what the hell is with all the absolute *denial* that there could be ANY lgbt themes at all? there are a lot of people reaching out in this thread because they noticed a lot of really interesting LGBT themes in the story, and yall are explicitly trying to make it clear that the movie is for straights only and that they're wrong. you're straight up projecting.",o34eyh

The only person they were trying to avoid was the girl, and that was only once they fell into the water and she was looking over the edge for them. Other than that, they thought they were alone.

No one is denying you're allowed to interpret it that way. Hell, I interpret it that way. But going around screaming that people are only allowed to interpret it that one way (even when the director himself said its themes are meant to be universal) that the movie is ""yours"", is not doing anyone any favors.

Who is ""y'all""? I didn't see any examples of this happening in this thread.
