dqlk9eh,Mac’s mom is being type cast ,7gs4g9
dqrumfg,"I found the ending as a parallel to what Mildred was saying to the Priest earlier in the movie.

That even though he didn't rape her daughter, and he wasn't even in the same country, he is still culpable because he is in the same group of people who would do that sort of thing.

Just something I thought was interesting.",7gs4g9
dqle1su,"Woody Harrelson's character was fantastic.  I like that it wasn't a black v. white conflict between his character and McDormand's character.  The letter he left her was hilarious.  I liked how McDormand's character was illogical and flawed.

dqlmv8f,"1. The blood splattering on Mildred's face was such an effective bit of tonal whiplash. I love how it takes both the audience and her aback for just a couple seconds and literally wipes the smile off her face; it's a shocking moment, a brilliantly performed moment by both actors. 

2. Well that makes it two amazing  performances as redneck racist cops this year, but who'd have thunk one could grow to sympathize with such a character. Rockwell and McDormand give career-bests here.

3. Haven't heard much talk about Carter Burwell's score around but I'd actually say this is his best collaboration with McDonagh yet, particularly love the track that plays over Harrelson's final moments.

4. Nice to see Željko Ivanek not as the butt monkey this time, but instead one of the more competent of the police officers.

dqlxoyn,"Can we talk about that fire scene? I thought it was perfect. The emotional weight of Dixon reading Willoughby's final words to him, contrasted with the molotov cocktails all while the music is playing made me laugh my fucking ass off. Best scene in the movie IMO.


Also that tracking shot was awesome, also got a lot of laughs.

-  The three billboards / the three letters

- The fact that Willoughby is a weirdly good writer then Dixon explains that you need to be good at English to be a cop

dqngray,"The scene where Dixon attacks the billboard company might be my new favorite scene of the year. Such a great depiction of grief on film, and a microcosm of the whole film. Unhealthy grieving at its most unhealthy. The beautiful song, the unbroken shot, Sam Rockwell trying his hardest not be charming, Caleb Landry Jones taking the on-screen beating of a lifetime, and even some of the little comedic beats. It's all so wonderful. It's amazing how McDonaugh manages to get you to sympathize with both the attacker and the victim in this scene, I loved it. ",7gs4g9

dqlcoos,"I saw it last week and enjoyed it tremendously. I think it is the best thing McDonagh has done at this point in his career. Even as a viewer well-acquainted with (and appreciative of) his majestically dark sense of humor, I found myself rocked by how bleak ""Three Billboards"" could be, at certain times.

It is worth mentioning that, for me, one of the most tragic moments in the film was the revelation that the billboards were in view of Mildred's house. Since we know that Angela was raped and murdered at the billboards (as evidenced by the scorch marks on the ground), this means that—even as she was enduring all of that fear, pain and suffering—she could see her home. As a viewer, you have to wonder if she was, in her final moments, praying that her mother or brother might see her and be able to provide help... or even just be there to hold her hand as she lay dying.

And the fact that this aspect of the crime is never directly remarked upon by any character (as far as I can recall... I did have to take a bathroom break) speaks to McDonagh's respect for the viewer.",7gs4g9

dqoqcfc,"Just saw it and love the way it makes you think about everything when it’s over. Bottom line though, at least to me, is that we (the audience) are meant to feel exactly as Mildred felt; Empty and longing for answers. We don’t get a nice gift-wrapped conclusion where everything is resolved and makes us feel better. But then, neither does she.",7gs4g9
dqlf3r2,"I don’t understand the rationale of including the gift shop scene. When the guy brags in the bar, he knows about Angela’s death. He’s still in Ebbing! Why is he bragging about raping and killing a different girl? Why the need for the gift shop to set up the twist? It’s a twist even without that scene and now we just have this odd unnecessary context that raises more questions than it answers. 

Are we to believe that he’s a random sadistic murderer passing through Ebbing, pretending he’s Angela’s killer to get a rise from Mildred, and getting off to bragging about raping/killing a different girl in a bar later? There’s just so many hoops to jump through to get an explanation for the gift shop scene. ",7gs4g9
dr4bzzf,"I just didn't understand what the point of this movie was or what it was trying to say. It felt completely aimless and tonally non-nonsensical. I really enjoyed Sam Rockwell's performance, but that's about it. I didn't understand any motivations of the characters and the whole movie just felt like actors acting. I didn't hate it, but I definitely missed the point of the movie if there was one. Please feel free to help explain to me what you got out of it. ",7gs4g9
drwh5jc,"Wondering why I'm not seeing more about one of the most important themes in the film - the fact that the suspect/soldier/rapist is ironic and symbolic. 

Essentially, he is a rapist and murderer. He raped and murdered a girl in Iraq or Afghanistan. He lives amongst us with impunity and gets away with it bc of the blind eye we turn to such things for people who mean little to us here, and who are marginalized. That man, the way he rubbed her daughter's death in her face, was indicative of the kind of scum that he was, and the brazen way such people walk amongst us. 

The fact that the characters in this film were able to evolve and change, not always through direct salvation or attainment of their actual goal (we never find Angie's killer, the dwarf never gets to fall in love, Dixon doesn't become a detective), but find it in other ways (The chief leaves earth on his own terms, Angie's mom for once wishes her ex well rather than giving him the angry reaction he wants, Dixon finds a true suspect through different means), and this keeps up with said theme. We never find Angie's killer. But there is a chance at identifying and possibly bringing to ""justice"" another rapist/murderer of young girls. 

To me, this all sums up the fact that despite life's chaotic, and often unfulfilling circumstances, we can find salvation and the universal attainment of progress in indirect, human ways amidst the random unrest. 

Anyway, so much more to discuss and so many great themes everyone is touching on...but just wanted to bring forth that particular aspect of the film, where I feel something important was being alluded to, much like police brutality issues, racism, and other things in the film. .",7gs4g9
dqlbpwu,"McDormand better get an Oscar nomination at least.

Edit: Oh shit. She won.",7gs4g9
dqlhms4,"A lot has been made about how in the past female characters needed to be likeable to be sympathetic.  This movie destroys that notion.  Mildred is a complete jerk to practically everyone she meets, and yet never lost my sympathy.  I also liked how the flashback showed that she wasn't much different before her daughter died.  The act of dying or losing someone close to you does not redeem you as a person, and this film showed that in many ways.

The only unfortunate thing is while I could imagine many actors in the roles of Dixon or Willoughby, it is hard to think of many actresses who could play Mildred.  Hopefully Hollywood gets more diverse and starts writing better roles for women.  Having more female protagonists is one thing, we also need a lot more female anti heroes. ",7gs4g9
dvbaj9n,"When I watched this film my impression of the ending was that the guy in the bar did actually do it but Abercrombie (the new chief) was covering for him after talking to the CO. This makes sense in the context and theme of the movie. The new chief is basically a corrupt politician.

Why would the rapist have visited Mildred if he was not connected in some way? Are we supposed to believe that he was just a guy who was passing through and knew all about the situation and the billboards?

Why did Abercrombie's story to Dixon have to include details about the CO who said the alleged rapist was out of the country? Why didn't Abercrombie just say that the DNA wasn't a match and leave it at that?

Also the way that Abercrombie told Dixon that ""he did good"" when getting the DNA from a bar fight seemed very odd. Look at it from the Chief's point of view, Dixon, who is a disgraced cop and a known drunk was involved in a bar fight and makes all these claims... then the DNA comes back negative. The chief would assume that Dixon is full of shit and wasting everybody's time, he would not be praising him. It seemed like the chief was just placating him so he wouldn't look into it further.",7gs4g9

dved82a,"Seems like no one is mentioning the fact that Mildred had a fire extinguisher in the car *because* Angela burned to death, it wasn't because she suspected someone would burn the billboards. Angela was killed just a few hundred feet from her home. Maybe Mildred found Angela's body, or maybe she got to Angela while she was still burning but couldn't put the fire out. Who knows? If something like that happens in your ""backyard"" you'd probably become a little paranoid and take precautions to make sure it doesn't happen again.",7gs4g9

dqll63p,"I posted this in another thread but I'll post it again:

You know, I really wanted to love Three Billboards, but while I still thought it was a good movie, it was just missing something that kept it from being great IMO. While McDormand, Harrelson, and Rockwell were all incredibly spectacular, there was an odd disconnect with the rest of the cast. 

For me it was the bizarre routes the film took that left me feeling like it could've been so much better. Things like the out-of-place ex-husband's girlfriend, Chief Willoughby's wife's confusing accent, the existence of the gift shop scene, how on-the-nose the scene when Rockwell overhears the alleged rapist was, and of course the weird CGI deer that ruined what would've been a great scene.

dqlbzz0,"Been waiting for this!
I cannot gush about this film enough, as I've already seen it twice. It managed to find the perfect balance of switching between making me laugh and making me cry between the scenes. Most noticeable example: THAT scene followed by Sam Rockwell dancing to ABBA. Because that's just how life goes. No big emotional send off, just life going on. Not to mention that Sam Rockwell has one of the best character arcs that I've seen in a long time. I just loved how everyone was just in this morally gray area (except for maybe Woody Harrelson's character who I initially thought was going to be a total dick.) 

But my absolute favorite scene: Mildred falling to her knees as she tries to put out the fires. It felt very Sisphyian but it solidified what her ex had told her earlier in the film how the billboards wouldn't bring back her daughter. The way her son tries to stop her but the anguish that Frances Mcdormand conveys when she yells at him was utterly heartbreaking. I really hope she at least gets an Oscar Nom.",7gs4g9

dst0b84,"Newbie here. First post. Loved the movie and the interesting discussion here. Insightful comments for the most part.

One thing I don't think has been mentioned is that McDonagh uses the Shakespeare device of having the ""fool"" reveal the underlying truth of the story, when the ditzy 19-year-old girlfriend says, ""Anger only begets more anger"".  That's it in a nutshell.

And BTW, Abbie Cornish's accent IS all over the place. It gets progressively more Australian through the course of the movie. In her last scene, when she gives Mildred the letter, she's full-on Aussie.",7gs4g9

Everyone I know that has seen it absolutely loved it and had no doubt it will win every award this year. The actors were also incredible - for me, personally Sam Rockwell was the best one. 
I wonder if this movie is being a bit better received in Europe then in the US. It is a british production and the humor, I feel, is very british/scandinavian. Everyone keeps mentioning that the accents were off, but of course, not having english as a mother tongue I couldnt tell, and it didnt bother me at all. 
For everyone saying it is not realistic, and something´s are off...have you seen the director´s other movies? I don´t think he is into realism. Even In Bruge, which has the most normal plot, felt a bit like fantasy land. ",7gs4g9

There's a change everytime there's something on fire. I also didn't expect Dixon changing from a racist cop to a  vigilante.

dv8qrg6,"I saw “Three Billboards” at a festival awhile ago, before it was released and before it was a huge award contender with a trail of controversies behind it. From what I’ve been following on that, I personally didn’t feel the film is condescending or sympathetic with a racist character - in fact, one of its main points of the script is how those people are products of their upbringing and circumstance, but that everyone can evolve and grow and eventually do the right thing (even when the “right thing” is on a gray area and involves tough moral choices). But the movie has an abrupt ending that didn’t sit so well with me - it finishes before that tough choice is made, as if the director avoided to push the story to its limits. Though I’m glad Martin McDonagh is expanding his fanbase and getting recognised by its talent, I wonder if people who enjoyed “Three Billboards” ever saw “In Bruges” (one of his early works and a film that is close to perfect in my book). If you haven’t, you should check it out. That was a movie that, IMO, went to the extremes and never looked back.

I must also praise the cast. Rockwell is my personal MVP, and considering the quality of Frances McDormand’s work, that’s saying something. As far as McDormand go, I always liked her as an actress, even though I feel she is one of those big personas who absorb their peculiar traits and mannerisms into their performances. But she can be a powerhouse when she finds a character who fits her style, like it happens here. I’m glad they got their Oscars.",7gs4g9

dqlcuoy,"I commented about this movie a few weeks ago on a ""best film you watched this week"" thread and decided to expand upon it here.

I think this movie perfectly encapsulates what a film should be, in structure and characterization. In Bruges is, IMO, one of the best black comedies ever, and while it still ranks very high on my list, I think *Three Billboards* is better as a complete work. No line of dialogue is wasted, and everything ties together - not neatly by any means, but satisfyingly.

Frances McDormand is perfect in this role (no surprise because it was written for her); she's so fucking sharp every single moment. Even at Mildred Hayes's most vulnerable, she doesn't lose her edge. But Sam Rockwell is honestly such a knockout too. His character goes through the most growth, and he plays it so believably. And the rest of the cast compliments these two characters amazingly.

*Three Billboards* proves that McDonagh is one of the best screenwriters working right now, and I just love the fact that he is able to weave these minor characters in and give them purpose too. One of my favorite moments is when Willoughby writes in his letter about finding out about the rapist-murderer by chance in a bar ""five years later"" and then Dixon overhears exactly that. Even though it's not the same guy, I thought that detail was just a fantastic example of foreshadowing in a film; it also falls perfectly in line with McDonagh's ironic sense of humor. I just love this movie so much, and I hope more people get to see it.",7gs4g9
dv6b6z2,"I thought the movie was pretty fantastic. Loved the black comedy injected to it just what I expected from the same director of In Bruges.

>We are trying to see if there is interest for an interactive r/movies table. The table would pull info from each r/movies official movie discussion poll. The table would show each movie's name, average score, standard deviation (how polarizing the movie is) and total votes, similar to the [IMDb Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=tt_awd). You would also be able to sort the table by these metrics. Movies would be added to the table with each new official movie discussion post. Finally, multiple tables could be created to show different sets of info (e.g. all movies discussed, movies from 2017, movies from 2018, etc.). Please take this [SURVEY](https://youpoll.me/3722/) so we can gauge your interest.

dqljmov,"Literally my only complaint about the movie was the wierd age gap between Chief Willoughby and his wife. 

It was distracting.  Especially since the movie made a point about how creepy it is for a 50+ year old man to be dating someone half his age.  Almost every scene between Woody harrelson and his wife would have played better if the actress had been within 10 years of his age at least.  It would have given the audience a sense of  deep connection and familiarity between the couple.  

But having a 35 year old actress play against a 56 year old man in a cutesy long-term marriage way makes it seem almost skeevy.   Add the girls accent and I am left almost wondering if she was bought online as a bride from overseas. 

It served no purpose to the plot except for random and unneeded eye-candy.  ",7gs4g9
drfkbgr,"The acting in this film was phenomenal, as was much of the story, but I felt like the last 1/5th or so betrayed the rest of the film. I guess it's in sticking with a McDonagh flick, similar to *Pulp Fiction* where you kind of feel like the writer/director is just like, ""and then THIS crazy turn happens, and then THIS crazy thing also happens!""

When the movie has so many powerful moments (especially Woody Harrelson's final scenes), it seems like all the absurdity that comes later just washes out the deepness of the first half of the film.

Really is just such a shame. I'm glad others enjoyed this so much, but for as great as much of this movie was, and how incredible the acting was, it was just far too uneven and unfulfilling in the last half or quarter or so that I just ended up not liking it overall.",7gs4g9

Really excited to see her take off.",7gs4g9
dqlymor,"This film left me oddly conflicted because I enjoyed the hell out of the movie in the theater but over the next 24 hours, all I could think about was all the gaping holes in the script. So does the movie ultimately succeed because I enjoyed the ride? Or does the film essentially cheat by presenting these emotional and cathartic moments without any actual adherence to logic to get to these points? I’m leaning towards the latter. Although, regardless, I think it’s easy to admit that this is McDonagh’s (either brother, for that matter) worst script.

The casting is probably most responsible for elevating it. I think the interrogation scene is a perfect example of how incredible Harrelson and McDormand’s chemistry was together. That being said, I can’t help but feel like they killed Willoughby off at least 20 minutes too early. It completely derailed the momentum.

Some other gripes:

- Dixon is presented as a violently racist cop. This is alluded to multiple times at the beginning of the film. This amounts to nothing and ultimately exists as more of a character quirk that’s pretty irrelevant. During his bar room beat down, the film’s two prominent black side characters are both present and yet they could’ve helped him in spite of his past or chosen not to because of it but instead no thought is given to it whatsoever. 

- In fact, the film kind of presented itself as a commentary on cops in America as the film opens: racism, incompetence, etc. But then it’s revealed that the cops haven’t actually done anything incompetently with the main case. It’s just unsolvable and the film is really about… guilt? revenge? It gets a little muddy there. I won’t fault a film for being misrepresented by its trailer (_Hail, Caesar_ did the same thing and I still enjoyed it) but I’d argue that the film, at least initially, thinks it’s about the same thing before losing its way.

- The cops are too incompetent. A man is thrown off a roof and the new police chief doesn’t even check on him? Two people are standing at the scene of a fire at the police station and nobody is curious? Charges are brought upon Mildred by the dentist she drilled into but that’s forgotten because Willoughby is sick. I don’t think that’s how it works. And don’t worry about assaulting two kids in a crowded area. Nobody cares.

- The Idaho man. WTF? So is he just passing through? Why the hell does he know Willoughby well enough to feel like he should threaten Mildred at work? Seems like a long commute to just be creepy to someone who he has no direct connection with. I don’t think the film wanted us to think that his innocence with this crime was ambiguous, but why was the scene with Dixon and the chief so fucking awkward? Why wouldn’t they just say he was deployed? And if it wasn’t supposed to be ambiguous, couldn’t the crime just’ve been rape and murder? Instead, we’re supposed to think it’s likely that two people have come into Dixon’s orbit that enjoy lighting people on fire _and fucking them while they’re on fire_!? That’s fucking dangerous. (Also that “she was so hot… literally” was painful).

- Willoughby’s wife and John Hawke’s GF were so poorely cast. I know it’s _possibly_ that a small town sherif could meet and marry a beautiful Australian women, but it raises more questions than its worth and is just needlessly distracting. Also, making the GF a bombshell also just leaves you wondering how Hawke snagged her, despite her walking in on him _strangling his ex-wife while his son holds a knife to her neck_ but she don’t care. Also there’s a mysterious comment about how he used to be a cop, but that’s also never touched upon again.

- Sam Rockwell was great in this. So I’m really bummed that his character wasn’t better constructed. Also, did anyone else think that there was supposed to be some sexual tension between Red and Dixon in that bar scene? If so, it was another thread that just kind of got abandoned. The forgiveness scene, on the other hand, is another instance where I really enjoyed the scene but, really, the dude nearly killed you and punched your secretary in the face.

- Is Lucas Hedges the only white teen male in Hollywood? This isn't a gripe because he’s been pretty great, I’m just saying: this, Ladybird, Manchester by the Sea. Dude is killing it and building an awesome resume.

There are just so many weird fucking holes in this script (I know there’s more that I’ve either forgotten or others in the comments have mentioned so I won’t bother repeating) that I can’t help but wonder if the script or film was gutted by people editing and meddling. It's really unfortunate that it detracts from what's also a very funny and well acted film, with some genuinely great moments. I’ve been a fan of Martin McDonagh’s writing since reading his plays in college. Also, if you haven’t seen it, I strongly recommend his short film _Six Shooter_ with Brendan Gleeson. Great stuff. This film, unfortunately, was a pretty big let down but I’m still glad I saw it.",7gs4g9

- Sam Rockwell was a revelation in this movie. He had me crying with him the whole time, never thought a racist cop could be so lovable.

- Good gravy, that police station firebomb scene was one of the best sequences in film I’ve seen all year.

- The desk sergeant and his little freak-outs were hilarious, good to see the annual Zeljko Ivanek appearance in a McDonagh movie wasn’t put to waste.

- Gotta Love whenever Lester Freeman shows up in a film, loved his role as the replacement chief.

- Frances McDormand. Dude. Just, yeah.",7gs4g9

Here's an excerpt:

> Eventually, it's clear that her only real investment in what happened to her daughter is the fact that it's *her daughter* - that something of hers was taken away and she must get revenge for her property being swiped from under her. There's a hollowness to her chosen method of interaction with everyone else on screen that makes it difficult to interpret the film's central pursuit any less cynically than that.",7gs4g9

Reading through this thread, a lot of people have offered plausible explanations which definitely are possibilities, but there's one I don't think I've seen discussed yet: is it possible that Abercrombie (the new police chief) was lying to Dixon? That in fact the DNA was a match, and the whole story about the guy being deployed was a lie? I mean, I can think of a few reasons why Abercrombie wouldn't want Dixon to be ""the guy"" who solved the murder.",7gs4g9

I'm so glad they added the scene in the car of them just cathartically doing all of this stuff. It would've completely changed the tone of the movie if they cut it without that scene. 

The one gripe about it is there were a lot of scenes that were just too on the nose...the I hope you get raped scene was just too much I thought. I really didn't need the whole anger begets anger scene of the movie. I think they did a fine job illustrating that without having to really hammer it home.

dqlwllx,"An intensely frustrating movie. There's a good core to the story, but the execution - especially the writing - is wildly uneven, and in some spots just embarrassing. Everything is written very broadly and exaggerated, which is fine, but when the tone abruptly shifts to sentimentality, it doesn't work. I can't feel anything for characters who have been established as cartoon archetypes. There are many characters who aren't real people - they just exist to execute specific plot points or fumble through awkward, heavy-handed dialogue. The whole thing is just sloppy. To the point where it feels like there were last minute rewrites or problems in the editing room.

I'm baffled by the critics' love for this one. McDormand is fine; she certainly commits to the intensity of the character, but the performance is one-note. Angry woman is angry. Harrelson is on cruise control, Rockwell and Dinklage are playing paper-thin cartoon characters, and the actress who plays Harrelson's wife is notable only because of how horribly miscast she is and how little chemistry she has with Woody.

McDonagh is really only interested in Mildred, Willoughby, and Dixon. Which is fine. It's just frustrating that, as a result, every other character is only used as scaffolding to get from plot point A to plot point B.

The stylized dialogue and tonal shifts (the ex's girlfriend does *not* exist in the same universe as anyone else in the movie) are a matter of taste, but I'm really struggling to understand how folks are swallowing the rickety construction underlying this film. It unavoidably comes off as Coen Brothers fan fiction.

Some other stuff that annoyed me:

- The ex-husband's girlfriend, who is so over-the-top cartoonish and tonally different than everyone else in the scene, that it feels like she's pausing for a laugh track
- The ""hilarious"" Big Bang Theory-level physical comedy of kicking two high school students in the crotch. Again, tonal whiplash.
- The most uncomfortable, unconvincing line reading of the year - ""That was a real nice fuck. You got a real nice cock, Mr. Willoughby.” (what human would say that?)
- The one-dimensionality of the female characters. Girlfriend and office assistant are ditzy. Daughter is a bitch. Mom is old and racist. Wife is hot and loves husband. Black shop owner is...black.

And the series of absurd coincidences that lead up to Dixon's wholly unearned ""turn"":

- Dixon just so happens to be the only cop in the station when it's firebombed
- Dinklage, whose character exists mostly so others can call him a midget, and who just so happens to have a crush on McDormand, also just so happens to be the only human within earshot of the station as she's firebombing it
- Police chief ignores Dinklage's obvious lying and the fact that McDormand IS WEARING A BACKPACK AND HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST THE POLICE
- Dixon just so happens to be placed in the same hospital room as the guy he threw out a window
- Red, for no rational reason, forgives Dixon
- Dixon just so happens to be drinking in the booth adjacent to a guy loudly bragging about raping a girl
- Black couple, whose characters exist for no other reason than to witness Dixon's assault, just so happen to be in the same bar at the same time",7gs4g9
ds64r7n,"This is the first film I have given a perfect 5 STARS to since Whiplash, which was over 3 years ago.

I didn't expect this movie to be this good. Wow This shit blew me the fuck away. I was dying laughing one minute then the next I was almost on the verge of tears. Had me glued to the screen every second and the script was really unpredictable. I had no idea where the movie was going.

It quite reminded me of Manchester By the Sea with the mix between dark humor and tragedy. I also did not expect it to be this so apologetically vulgar. And god damn this was the most redneck shit I have seen and I loved every minute of it.

It had some of the most memorable characters in film I have ever seen. Almost everyone is flawed in this movie and I love it. Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrellson stole the damn movie. Some of the finest acting ever. Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the fuck out of this. The dialogue is so incredible and raw.

This one is a must watch and I doubt anything else will top this movie for me this year even though there are so many good movies this year. ",7gs4g9
dszznbp,"Overall, the whole thing felt like it was written by someone who only knew small town America from articles in The New Yorker. Look at all these salt of the earth folks, with their vague homey accents (that keep going in and out, most noticeably with Dinklage), antenna TVs and flip phones, wearing coveralls all the time even if they work a retail gig at a gift shop. It all felt so phony and inauthentic. So many characters read like caricatures of what the writer figured a Middle American [insert occupation here] must be like. Sure, it's totally okay for a journalist to publicly speculate that Prominent Person A drove Prominent Person B to suicide. Sure, grown adults can publicly assault children in front of their school. Sure, small-town police officers always attempt to murder local businessmen in broad daylight and face no legal repercussions for it. These people are too folksy to press charges.

The handful of black characters seemed to exist as plot devices, helping out the good white folk, and being mistreated by the bad ones.

There's the issue of Mildred as a character. The tone of the movie seems to suggest that we should root for her, but I'm sorry, this woman is dangerous, not in a ""grrr momma bear"" way but in a criminally deranged way. By the end of the film she has committed multiple felonies and is considering committing more.

The Rockwell character's turn felt very sudden and unearned.

The sequence with the dentist was absurd and did not need to be in the movie.

Frances McDormand was good but she wasn't doing anything we haven't seen her do before. She deserves Oscars in general, but not for this particular performance.",7gs4g9

dwdk046,"Great movie. The greatness of the movie definitely comes from the acting and direction, as I do have issues with the script and character motives. I felt McDormand's character was morally wrong and some of her actions unjustifiable. Normally this would be okay, but the movie seemed to not have addressed this at all. Her case had no leads, there was nothing anyone could do; why would she burn down the police station? Stabbing the dentist? Wasting her money on those billboards? Like Woody's character said, the only way the case would be solved would be through sheer luck and ""stupidity"". And that's exactly what almost happened. The case was a dud. I felt the movie should have addressed McDormand's character's actions a little more. 

In my mind she was in the wrong and she was bringing everyone around her down along with her. And the film did nothing to address this, not in any degree. But goddamn some of the scenes in this movie were perfect.

I did think it was really good, but it didn't pack the punch I was expecting. Personally I enjoyed In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths more than this. Everyone's talking best picture frontrunner, and right now I just don't see it. I don't know, maybe I need to watch it again.",7gs4g9
dqrcc47,"I thought it was the best film I've seen in years.  This is not a film about a gruesome crime.  It's not a film about corrupt police or finding a killer.  It's not really about three billboards and the consequences that arise from putting them up.  This is a film about grief. 


All the main characters are all grieving to some extent, and they all handle it differently.  The wild swings in scenes and characters doing unpredictable and/or out-of-character things: that's grief.  There are moments where characters are fine and then they're feeling intense emotions: grief.  Those moments of intense unexpected violence: grief.  Slight insanity/talking to slippers: grief. 


If you've never lost someone you were close to and dealt with that grief, then you may not be able to understand this film.  I can see where you'd think these characters were too extreme. 


In the last 4 years, I've lost a lot of people that were important to me, and I've learned a lot about grief as a result.  I didn't find the characters or the plot unbelievable.  Maybe exaggerated a bit for plot purposes, but this felt real to me.  Violent, funny, profane.  This is real life, and real people dealing with real emotional stuff. 


Also, I think it's helped me in my own grieving process, and for that, I'm grateful. ",7gs4g9

I've read every one of his plays and while I really love In Bruges and thought Seven Psychopaths was solid none of his films really felt like his A-game. So with all this praise and all this hype I was so excited for this film and it was just kind of a mush for me.

It's not bad by any means, better that SP in fact, but I just found it okay. The acting is undeniable, two of the best performances of the year from basically the leads McDormand and Rockwell. But the film just felt like a bunch of undercooked ideas. Didn't help that it really felt like a stage play he quickly adapted to a film, especially the last line which you can almost see the stage dimming to black on. 

I get the point of the film and the themes of grief and revenge. I get that at the end it's about do you want them to kill the rapist or not. I just don't think it achieved what it set out to do. I didn't care much for the characters and there was just no narrative thrust for me to latch on to.

dtdt4qr,"Just saw the movie. Definitely was a good one and deserves a lot of the nominations it has received. A few things though:

1. The writing seemed to hiccup a little throughout. For example [the argument the mother and daughter had right before she died.](#spoiler). There are ways of portraying the dramatic irony they were trying to get across without making it match so well.. Another time was at the bar near the end [when you think the man in the bar is the murderer. What he's describing is almost identical to the murder that's the major focal point.](#spoiler). The plot has already made the guy a suspect. Everyone in the audience is already assuming he's the guy. The writing could have been much more subtle to achieve the same thing [however then it would have been believable later when you find out it's not him. Hard to suspend disbelief when a guy who committed almost the same rape/murder decides he's just going to hang around a small town in a different state than he's from where they're searching for someone who committed the same exact crime](#spoiler) 

2. I didn't mind the ending at all. I've seen people complaining about it but I don't really mind the ambiguous endings and I think all the major conflicts between characters were pretty well resolved. 

3. I get the point of anger spreading from person to person and everything but it seemed like the character development was a bit rushed at times and some of the choices they made were odd.

Earlier in the movie, there is the flashback where mcdormand and newton are arguing. I saw this flashback scene and originally thought they would have a later scene set in the past explaining what happened the night Newton’s character was raped and killed, and we’d find out the culprit (similar to the movie wind river with The scene with bernthal and asbille). It takes the mystery out of knowing, but if executed well, I thought it would have added a whole other element and feeling to the film.

dqm34jx,"There was a ton here that I really loved, but at the same time I had a hard time feeling like it came together in a unified, coherent way. There is a lot going on with themes of grief, guilt, and pain, but a lot of it feels a little scattershot and unfocused. I loved the parallels between how Angela and the sheriff deal with their own pain, one emotional and the other physical, but none of these themes seemed to carry over into the rest of the movie.

The tonal shifts I also found a little odd, and nowhere near as deftly handled as in *In Bruges*. A lot of the writing, while technically good, seems very self-satisfied, and in some cases, like in Willoughby's suicide notes, are borderline contrived in how ""movie-ish"" they seem.

Mildred being the self-asserted, strong, aware, brutal woman that takes no shit neither from people nor from the system while the ex husband's girlfriend represents the feminine that is still subjugated, un-aware, un-movable and quiet frankly vapid that can't accomplish anything without the help of people? No one talks about the representation of the lived feminine and what the messages behind the movie truly are. None of you has talked about the tragedy that is rape, violence and death by those things and the tragedy that women and mothers have to face when those things happen. I don't know, imo the whole point of the movie is to highlight such themes in a dark, nihilistic and claustrophobic way, one that makes you forever and ever turn away from any of the action perpetrated in it. 
P.s: I'm sorry if what i wrote is not completely coherent and grammatically correct, english is not my first language.

He came away with the contrary impression that she saw Dixon in there and was calling repeatedly because she wanted him to pick up.

edit: I should add the one thing that I really did not like about this movie, which was the Woody Harrelson's wife character. She's a minor character, but every time she was on screen it felt so out of place. Why is this old Missouri cop married to a smoking hot, ~20 years younger british chick?

We need multiple scenes of the young naive gf of the divorced dad. Less is more. Movie tried to juggle too much.

Sam Rockwell's ""character arc"" was laughable. He was a retarded typical small town bravado cop who had done bad things. All he needed was a letter and he instantly converted to martyr? Putting him in the same hospital room as the guy he permanently damaged lol okay.

Combine the plot with the level of actors and it has the ingredients for a solid movie, but the writing is bad. (The priest scene was cringey, I thought it was going somewhere, but Mildred's dialogue was woof).

I think he’s more 90s Tarantino than Tarantino himself.

Unfortunately I was disappointed by Three Billboards. It feels gratuitous, eager to jump on current trends and disjointed. I cannot tell if this is due to poor writing or to a supporting cast unable to portray what was required.

The family scenes especially feel like a director trying too hard to fulfil what he has been led to believe are his strengths. I normally love McDonagh s dialogue but there is nothing especially sharp or witty about families who basically swear at each other a lot. All the family scenes feel the same. Characters lose credibility.

After seeing this movie I definitely believe Rockwell and McDormand should take home Oscars. Like I said before, I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I saw it, however, it *probably* doesn't deserve Best Picture.

my problem is frances macdormand's character.   the movie sort of portrays her as this warrior for good going agianst racist/evil institutions.  'the church sucks man!'  to me it was super corny.

I mean it could simply be he was involved in rape.murder overseas while serving and he's a sick puppy and enjoyed taunting Frances McDormand's character for the hell of it, but it still leaves the other possibility open in my opinion.

dtm26we,"Just got back from the cinema, and absolutely loved this one! One of the best movies I watched at the pictures in a long time. I'm actualy surprised at all the middling reviews on here, but to each their own. 
My take on the rapist is that he's probably a psychopath who specifically targets women. The rape in question most likely occured, but overseas as a war crime in the Middle East which could explain the woman being ""burnt"" after the crime was committed (house was burned, bomed afterwards?). If the guys in the army he probably travels around the country a lot, could've happened upon this case involving a ""smug"" self assured woman looking for justice in her daughter's rape--a crime this guy obviously has committed in the past and decides to harass Mildred over it. 

Also to add, the main reason I think I enjoyed this film so much was that it reminded me of my favourite 70s crime thrillers ; reckless and disillusioned  ""heroes"" whose become muddled by their own search for justice that they do more harm than good. Electra Glide in Blue,  William DeVane in Rolling Thunder, George C. Scott in Hardcore, just some roles and movies I fondly thought about while watching Three Billboards. ",7gs4g9
dqxcv4v,"The critical reception of this movie absolutely baffles me. And I typically love Frances McDormand and black comedy.

I have lots of issues with the facile politics of this movie (oh, Officer Dixon becomes a sympathetic character despite his past as a ""n***** torturer"" and overall violent, racist shitbag because [he gets in a bar fight with a dude he suspects is a murderer](#spoiler)?) and the equally facile characterization. But my biggest gripe is that small but obviously intentional/dead earnest costuming and design choices were *constantly* throwing me for a loop. 

For instance: why the irritatingly overt product placement for Duck Rabbit, a beer that makes no sense in the context of a working class community in Missouri. It's from the East Coast, it has a limited distribution, it's an expensive milk stout, it just... doesn't make sense for multiple characters to be drinking it. Why does this small town have such a huge population of very young, modelesque, multiracial/multinational babes? Seriously, there's the hot but vacuous 19 year old girlfriend; Chief Willoughby's inexplicably British and WAY too young wife; the ditzy TV reporter; Mildred's cool coworker/black gift shop proprietor; the 20-something artsy secretary for the advertising agency... Don't give me a cast filled with overweight, toothless offensive stereotypes of small town women, but damn, pretty much every woman in the movie outside of Mildred and Dixon's mom is 25, 115 lbs, 5'10"", and dressed to the nines. Speaking of dress: why does Mildred wear denim coveralls to her job at a gift shop? Is this supposed to evoke Rosie the Riveter? Why? Are we to believe that a person living in small town Missouri, where rent for a four-bedroom house runs about $300 and where average household income rarely hits $30K, would estimate the cost of an individual billboard on a desolate back road at nearly $1700 a month? Are we to believe that this Ozarks community is majority *Catholic*? 

I grew up in a small town and also spent nearly a decade of my life in Missouri. I don't understand the decision of explicitly ""placing"" a movie and then expending zero effort on actually invoking that place with the shine of truth. Sure, go ahead and mythologize the setting (a la *Fargo*), but don't actively screw up the details (what do people drink? what do they wear? what religion do they practice or not practice? what does the architecture look like? the furniture? the signage?) that help immerse the viewer into your world.      

At any rate, I could have forgiven a lot of the details (costuming, set design, individual lines of dialogue) if the big picture (characterization, overall tone, messaging) had worked, and vice versa. But both fell flat for me.         ",7gs4g9

It was a most enjoyable film. We take every main protagonist in any movie as the correct side of good, the moral compass is usually driven by the protagonist. And as we slowly watch this movie, it makes you question that narrative.

I liked how the tone of the movie was kept from dropping into a dark movie that will bum one out. The black comedy aspect was fun to watch.

I do agree that the black characters were just used as props and not given the same treatment or depth in character as others in the movie. That part felt a bit forced and shoe horned in to try and convey some sort of equality as a virtue in the movie but failing in that attempt.",7gs4g9

dqmkhwy,"I've seen this movie twice and love it.


What I love the most is the whole point of the movie is expressed by the most dimwitted character in the entire film. The ex husband's 19 y/o girlfriend. The fact that the even the dumbest character can see this fact: In the restaurant she says ""anger begets anger"". By this point  characters have already begun their redemption arc. After Sheriff Willoughby leaves Dixon his note that all he needs in his life to be a good Detective is love. At the end Dixon and Mildred drive to Idaho to beat the shit out the ""innocent rapist"". Did he kill her daughter? No. Did he kill and rape someone? Yes. They figure that's reason enough to deserve what's coming to him. On the ride there they say ""I'm not so sure about this"".

This movie isn't about forgiveness. It's about anger begetting anger, hate begetting hate, and love begetting love. They don't have to forgive the rapist, but bringing more anger and violence into the world will only bring more hate and violence. I think on their ride there that's what they agree upon.

dt94mc1,"So I didn't have time to read EVERY post, but haven't seen my theory... so here it goes.

First point, as the billboard says, ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS.""   This seems like a theme.  This ties closely to the concept that it's a small town and everyone already knows all events and drama.  

1. As in, everyone knew the chief was dying.  
2. It is implied Dixon did torture someone in custody although the Chief awkwardly and unconvincingly denies it by saying ""There was no proof.""
3. The new chief watching Dixon beat a guy thrown from a window  
4.Even at the end, Dixon, the biggest idiot around (don't make me back this up with the countless examples) wasn't the least bit taken back by Mildred's admission that she burnt the place down.  

All these clear crimes throughout the movie, and in most cases the guilty person is known.

So, why no ARRESTS?

Could the answer be a cover-up or just bad police work?

The ONLY arrest in the movie was a BS arrest of marijuana cigarette possession. 

I'm assuming a cover-up.  ""THEY"" ? sent a seemingly decorated, intelligent, well spoken/educated black man to be chief in a town where an officer was accused of torturing a black man in custody.  Was he sent to help sweep this incident under the rug?  

Is he also former military to help cover-up/smooth over the rape of this girl?  All the comments of ""classified"" when talking about the DNA results wouldn't make it too outlandish to think that they are protecting someone in the military.  I also assume that the DNA could've been a match from day one, but when they sent it out for testing the government somehow intervened with the results.  Nobody in town at fault, but still n answer to the billboards question.

Pair that with why this guy had such a specific and similar story at the bar, the same guy that taunted Mildred at the store.

Not one for conspiracy theories usually, but the parts seem to fit.

Revisiting the know arrests theme... No arrests she asks, and ironically is never arrested for drilling the dentist's thumb, threatening officers, or burning the station down.  Is she just really proving a point on this town's shit police work?

Won't get into it this post, but the hero and antihero development, to them meeting in the middle and driving off together to end the movie is quite poetic.

dut5dr9,"
At a time when the world is grappled with Twitter wars and political turmoil, Martin McDonagh's dark comedy is a clear winner. As the name suggests, the story does revolve around 3 billboards loaned in Ebbing by Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand). The messages across these billboards doesn't become as major as McDormand's deadpan expressions. It is her silence which stabs you with unmistakenable tenacity and vigour. 

The Missouri police are mocked with their careless attitude on handling crimes, rapes and Mrs. Hayes acting as their constant remembrance of failure. Though the movie is positioned for McDormand's character to outshine, plotlines of the chief of the cops played by Woody Harrelson and Jason Dixon played by Sam Rockwell leave quite a punch on your thinking mind. 

The platonic one-dimensional plotline becomes quite vibrant with Carter Burwell's soundtrack in between. Walk Away Renee by The Four Tops is one of the highlighting score in the film. 

Hits: McDormand's silence, short crispt and gag-worthy messages in the 3 billboards, Caleb Landry Jones innocence, dark humour.
Misses: Drama. As much as the storyline is streamlined, there is not much to expect throughout the movie. 

It is still a watchable movie :)

dr91r19,"This was one of those movies where you have no expectations going into it, and come out blown away by the message and the acting. I'm sure there will always be speculation, but from what I saw, the whole message of the movie was acting on impulse, and the effects of those actions. Every heinous act we saw resulted in an equally heinous act, with Woody initially taking his life to begin the cycle. Yeah, a lot of people are saying they don't get the point, and the ending left a lot open, but by the end both characters understood what led them to that point in life, and it was acting on emotional impulses instead of logic.

Overall, one of my favorites of 2017, highly recommend.",7gs4g9

Besides, I was wondering if anyone else noticed the focus on fingernails throughout the movie: [1. In one of the first scenes Mildred is chewing on her fingernails in the car; 2. Later on she drills a hole through the dentist's fingernail; 3. In the bar, officer Dixon uses his fingernails to scratch and collect the DNA.](#spoiler) Could this be intentional and, perhaps, symbolic (e.g. anger -> revenge -> personal improvement (helping others))?

dqma30e,"So, I've been excited for this film since they announced it. I've seen *Six Shooter*, *In Burges,* and *Seven Psycopaths* probably almost a dozen times each, and I love them dearly. I have all of McDonagh's published plays (some of which are better than the films) and love them dearly. 

Perhaps it was a bit of a victim to my expectations, but I was a tad let down by this film. I'm going to have to give it another watch in a few months so I can try to be more objective. 

I thought the writing was a bit less tight than in other of McDonagh's work. One of the reasons that *In Bruges* was so amazing was that just about everything in the latter parts of the film is set up by an earlier scene. It's probably the best example of Chekhov's gun I've seen. (For instance, the change Ken isn't allowed to use to get into the church tower at the beginning of the film is the same change he sprinkles rom the tower before jumping.) 

*Three Billboards* felt a bit looser to me. That's not inherently a fault, but there were far more coincidences than I'd expect in a McDonagh film. Dinklage's character showing up at the police station being one; Rockwell's character sitting behind that guy being another. 

Lucas Hedges is also so dreadful. My goodness. The scene of him in the car with McDormand was painful. 

Much better than most films I've seen this year, but a bit underwhelming considering it's a McDonagh film. At least for me.",7gs4g9
dqnlki8,"I loved this movie, but honestly I'm just here because I want someone to explain Lucas Hedges to me, because I do not understand him. What am I missing about him as an actor?

Watching Manchester by the Sea last year, I held the same opinion. He honestly came close to ruining that movie for me, but then he got an Oscar nomination. I was completely flabbergasted.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. The scene when he starts yelling at Frances McDormand when they're passing the billboards entirely took me out of the movie, and it took awhile for me to get pulled back in.

I went in with big expectations. In bruges is one of my favourite movies, and Seven Psychopaths I thought was just okay. For me, this is Martin McDonagh's worst film.

I could not get into this one.

I think the dialogue was haphazard, clunky, not how people talk. I thought some of the acting from lesser characters was just straight bad.

The direction was not very good, the pacing was all over the place.

Frances McDormand played her role well, but I found her unlikeable. I found most characters in this movie unlikeable, and some of them had little motivation for what they were doing at all.

I thought Sam Rockwell was the best in the bunch, and his character actually had an arc that was interesting. The scene where he threw the guy out of the window was also the best scene in the film for me.

But other than that, There were a lot of cheesy moments that felt tacked on, and made me roll my eyes a bit. (Orange juice scene, deer scene, Woody's final scene, the letters he writes). There was also some plot holes, and just lazy writing.

I don't know. I'm disappointed, and I know I'm the minority on this one because a lot of people love this movie, and I really really wanted to love it. This is an original story, and it had it's moments, but I can't see the hype.

dqq92g4,"Honestly, all I've seen (until I hit film Twitter) for this film was pure acclaim so I was surprised by how...polarized the reaction seems to be. For me, this is a movie that just doesn't let down for a second. So much so that certain flaws in the movie went over (Mildred's friend being arrested and then being completely forgotten until the end, the occasional unrealistic or over the top dialogue, the pointlessness of Mildred's bloods vs. crips speech, pretty much NO ONE receiving any consequences for their actions), but even in spite of those, I loved Three Billboards. There were just so many scenes where when I felt I was losing interest in the film, it swept me back in. Another thing that I don't think is criticized enough is the fact that Mildred's ex-husband's 19 year old girlfriend and Peter Dinklage's characters are pretty much just used as props. If Charlie is supposed to be the bad guy for fucking younger girls, why is she portrayed as stupid? I get that the film needed comic relief, but eh. Also while I do think James is far more layered than her, I still feel like the whole point of his character is ultimately to show that although Mildred is our ""hero"", she is still flawed and prone to her own prejudices. I guess I just wish there was a better ending for his character - hell, I would've taken Mildred driving off into the sunset with him instead of that ""changed"" racist any day. 

That being said, I can't recall a film in forever that's biggest strength could also be its biggest weakness. The most human moments in the script are the best - Willoughby's suicide note, most of Robbie's lines, moments when Mildred was grieving. But damn, who on this earth actually says ""cunt"" that much? 

Ultimately, Three Billboards is a hot mess - tons of great moments mixed in with dialogue that sometimes doesn't work and plot points that are never really resolved. Also the trailer makes this look boring as fuck. I'd strongly recommend it, if only to form an opinion on it because, with a storyline that redeems a racist, it is certainly going to get a lot of people talking during Oscar season.

I thought it was great overall, a compelling study on grief and pain and hurt and how we react to such, and how, if we're lucky, we may realize that such reactions are a choice. I saw the film as a meditation on the laws of karma and intention. McDormand was strong but Harrelson and especially Rockwell were stellar.

I am so glad I did. I love how simple the premise was, but they were able to build up such complicated characters with a wide array of emotions. Every action they took you were able to empathize and why they were doing what they did.
I have honestly never seen a movie that was able to play out the theme of forgiveness so well. When Red gave the OJ to Dixon, and at the very end when you see Dixon knew Mildred started the fire all along, but knew she never intended to harm him, were very well made scenes.",7gs4g9

The ""cock"" line? Wasn't that just the cringiest thing ever? It was just so forced and disingenuous. 

Abbie Cornish's accent, I didn't know what she was doing.

The weird amount of old men with incredibly attractive young women for girlfriends.

The weird tone of the film, sometimes I was laughing but no one else in the cinema was and other times I wasn't laughing and everyone else was. It felt like this film should have just stuck it's neck out and been a hard as nails black comedy, none of this wishy washy feelings stuff like the flashback of her saying ""I hope you get raped"".

The music sounded very dated.

The inclusion of Mildred's son, he didn't really add a great deal, they could have developed that relationship more or just left it, but instead gave us this half-developed story.

Also [""yeah well I hope you get raped"" ](/spoiler). The fuck kind of thing is that for a mother to say, even in the heat of an argument? And [burning down the police station was just wreckless and needless](/spoiler).

Red was probably my favourite character actually. He just got embroiled in some mess that he had no horse in.

Dixon. [His transformation was too extreme, too unbelievable. A redemption story would've been fine, but he went from worlds biggest cunt to worlds nicest guy in the length of a letter] (/spoiler)

* Why does Sam Rockwell's character have to be racist? They say early on in the movie that he tortured/killed a black person in custody and nothing comes of it. Never comes back, never really defines his character. You could remove that aspect of his character and he'd be exactly the same. Just make him a super drunk with bad emotional problems. 

* Why does Mildred have an abusive, ex-cop ex-husband? He serves no purpose to the plot that couldn't be done by another character. He's an unneeded hurdle. You could just say Mildred had enough money leftover from working a long time, none of this ""trailer"" business that's brought up. 

* How is 56-year-old Woody Harrelson married to 35-year-old Abbie Cornish, who is using her full Australian accent? Doesn't sound fitting for small town life. 

* Why would the [rapist for the crime taunt in front of Mildred what he could have done? Why would brag about raping/burning someone at a bar? Why would someone out of town from Idaho come to this same place twice for that long period of time?](#spoiler)

dqnv70q,"Possibly my least favorite film of the year. The tone was totally inconsistent, I was never sure what the director was intending for me to feel, it was just a huge mess. A lot of great ideas on paper, but it just falls flat. I feel like one of the big themes of the movie was that actions have consequences, but the story just totally cherry picks which actions have which consequences.

Frances McDormand terrifically delivered some of the worst dialogue I've heard in recent memory. She's truly a treasure. No else could salvage a completely idiotic scene where the protagonist talks to a CGI deer for no other purpose than emotional exposition. 

And as much as I'm critical of religion myself, the scene where she tells off the pastor was just a wreck. If religion had been more of a theme in this film, it would have made a lot more sense, but that pastor is never seen before or after that scene. It was just such an obvious example of a director getting on their soap box. Why do you need to devote a scene of your movie to an irrelevant topic? You're a filmmaker, just make a film related to that topic! Then you get to talk about it as much as you want and in a much more artful way instead of shoe-horning it into another film.

This is nitpicky, but as a Missourian, I occasionally didn't have a clue what characters were saying. Accents were all over the place, the diction and nomenclature were all off. I know they didn't film in MO, but they picked a spot that sure looked like The Ozarks geographically, but still they did a pretty bad job of reflecting that region culturally. It's just a ""generic southern town"" which is problematic because Southern identity as a Missourian is a complicated topic itself.",7gs4g9

I loved both of McDonagh's previous movies, so this was a no brainer. Saw it last weekend while incredibly excited, and I found myself surprisingly not getting into it at first, because I wasn't 100% sympathetic with Mildred and wasn't finding any of the characters particularly with any depth.

But, silly me, McDonagh never does anything straightforward.

Once [Willoughby commits suicide](#spoiler) the movie really took a turn for me and it was riveting as a character study. Just every interaction, every moment had me re-evaluating characters I had judged one scene, then found myself with a completely different opinion the next scene. It even made me reconsider my thoughts on the first act in a new light and made me appreciate it all the more.

This film, more than In Bruges or Seven Psychopaths, I feel McDonagh's history and strength as a playwright come forward and help the movie shine. That said, I wasn't a fan of the dialogue in this movie a lot of the time. Some of it was cliche and some of it was really unnatural. It took me out of it here and there, which is too bad because those two previous movies had some brilliant dialogue.

The acting in this movie was great. Definitely nomination/award worthy. The plot I think was okay.

I love In Bruges. It's a movie about ridiculous characters doing ridiculous things and yet it's all believable on some level. Which ads to how ridiculous they are.

In this movie the characters did not ring true at all. And considering the talent that was there, it almost makes me angry. I'm not sure where the disconnect is but the characters were simply not believable. And they kept making different decisions that the character I saw 10 minutes ago was not capable of doing. I'm not talking about growth. I'm talking about a character that is well defined and then makes choices off of that character.

The only thing I can come up with it with that's concrete is, was the ex-husband's character necessary? Couldn't they have got to the same place without that character at all? Sometimes you trim out parts of the story because you don't need it to get to the end. Even if you really like the scene or the dialogue, you still cut it out because it gets in the way of the momentum of getting to the end. I think this movie has too many characters that do the same thing.

Honestly it felt more like an after school special then a movie. I'm not sure what I'm missing, but I almost walked out after 30 minutes.

The scene that rung the most true was the final one when they are driving in the car. I saw two actors at their best talking to each other's characters and being totally genuine. And the question and answer that they give each other is totally genuine. And it is the antithesis of almost everything else I saw up to that point.

dr58f4i,"This movie was definitely all over the place tonally. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a black comedy or a straightforward drama.

I also hated nearly every character in the film at one point or another, but I think that was kind of the point. It seems like this was a movie about how people use trauma to justify their actions. The scene where James (Peter Dinklage) confronts Mildred gets at this, where he's talking about the things he has to be bitter about - his dwarfism, his alcoholism - but how he doesn't use that as an excuse to treat people badly. The only characters we don't actively hate at one point or another are characters we don't see much of (the son, James, Denise), so it almost be assumed that they have their issues as well. So, thematically, I'd say it's about the cycle of abuse/trauma, and how it's damn near impossible to break. That theme, unfortunately, got lost in the muddled tone, I think.

I'm writing this immediately after seeing the movie and the pervasive thought I have is: What was the point?

* What happened to that guy who showed up in the gift shop and destroyed a bunny?

* What was the point of the priest showing up in their house and that long protracted crips & bloods story that turned into a condemnation of the catholic church?

* Why did they make Jason Dixon a racist?

* Why is Peter Dinklage in the movie at all?

* What was the purpose of John Hawkes' character?

* How did Mildred get away scot-free for drilling a dentist's finger?

* What was the point of Dixon arresting Mildred's black co-worker off screen, only for that entire subplot to be resolved off screen as if it didn't happen at all?

* What did Willoughby's cancer subplot have to do with the movie?

I remember sitting in the movie theater. The police station had just burned down. And I was watching Mildred have her dinner date with Peter Dinklage's character and all I could think was ""Where the fuck are we in this movie?"" 

McDonagh made his claim to fame with In Bruges, one of my all-time favorites, and Seven Psychopaths. His dialogue is witty, the characters are complicated and the atmosphere of his movies borderline between dark tragedy and bizarre comedy. I've come to regard him as a truly unique artist, but this film reveals that the true artist must be his editor, because the writing in this film is cringe-worthy and awkward. Every other scene is built up to write some one-off joke that isn't even funny (nigger torturing versus colored-people torturing? really?). 

So far McDonagh's movies have had hit-or-miss moments, but they had an underlying theme. You could write a ten page thesis on the morality of In Bruges' characters and Seven Psychopaths is basically its own dissertation of the concept of film writing. By comparison, this movie is completely aimless. Characters are introduced and forgotten about on a whim and nothing is ever resolved. Seriously, was there a single plotline that concluded in this movie?

I feel like my post is as scatter-brained as the movie itself, but all I can really say is that this movie was tremendously disappointing. I have no idea what people saw that made them like it, unless they're unfamiliar with In Bruges or other movies that have a similar tone (Burn After Reading comes to mind) and decided this must be a masterpiece.

However, one thing that is objective that no one is talking about is how bad the editing was. As a film editor, the shot-to-shot editing was that of a first year film student. It’s like they got too much coverage of every scene and just decided to use all of it every time. Early editing lesson is you don’t have to use every shot you film.

Certain things were just too coincidental as well, like they just happened to put Dixon in Red's room?  Mildred just drives around with an enormous fire extinguisher in her car?

Huge fan of McDonagh. The movie was very dark and emotional, the acting was great especially Woody, McDormand and Rockwell. 

It wasn't as violent as I thought but it was funnier than I assumed. Overall the movie put me in the role of Mildred Hayes and made you feel her frustration. Very happy I saw it and another solid piece of work from McDonagh. I loved the open ended ending, and the fact Rockwell's character knew it was McDormand who left him burned but didn't hold the grudge. In fact the letter mixed with that experience seemed to have fleshed out his inner good.

Gripes: Would have liked to see more of Caleb Landry and Peter Dinklage in the movie. Felt Dinklage left the movie in an odd way and thought he would have a larger role. Felt his role was made for comedic midget relief which I hoped would turn into something more.

When Dixon attempts to turn his life around and begins to investigate the murder, this is just a deluded attempt to mask the shame of him committing the murder in the first place. Why else would he hold a gun to his head when he is telling Mildred that ""it wasn't the guy"" when he speaks to her on the phone. I thought that was the moment he was going to reveal that he was the murderer and blow his brains out. Instead being the coward he is, he carries on living in denial.](#spoiler)

I felt that the tone was uneven, possibly on purpose. But In Bruges is WAY better than this film. The comedy was good but should have been more. The anger and tragedy felt contrived. The entire script felt like an story exercise in the writers head and not something that would be based on a true story. Which I didn't like.  I wouldn't recommend seeing this in the theater for those reasons. Although I do appreciate movies that don't contain super heros or cartoons, so an empty theater to myself was nice. ",7gs4g9

First of all... I hate the damn award season race.  I go to the movies once or twice a week and during the year I see a lot of crap movies mixed in with the good.  Now that its awards season, all of the ACTUALLY really good movies get released together and I'm having trouble getting to them all in good time!

So this was a pretty good movie with amazing performances: How the hell we're supposed to root for McDormand's character I don't know... she does nothing endearing and is frankly a bitch throughout, yet in spite of all that we as the audience are STILL symathetic to her throughout.  Wonderful performance. 

Also I was struck that nothing happened that you would expect. The plot twisted and turned and there were some 'holy shit' moments thrown in for good measure.  As someone who likes their films, it was refreshing to be surprised throughout rather than being able to read the tropes.
In a similar vein, I liked the arc of Dixon...again good guy/bad guy ideas are subverted and again this is a tribute to Rockwell's performance.

Finally, I liked that it didn't use the usual conventions to pull at the heartstrings and get me emotional, which in this film would've felt kinda cheap.  (Ie having Mildred blubbering all the time, violin music etc) But instead they had plenty of powerful moments that really nailed home the point (eg the orange juice in the hospital).

So now I have to find the time for Darkest Hour, All the Money... and Call Me By Your Name... The Shape of Water and Ladybird hasn't been released in my country yet either, but I'm thinking Three Billboards is gonna be pretty close to the top of that list.  ",7gs4g9

It very much felt like a non-American's perspective on America as being some lawless wasteland where you can commit FELONY after FELONY with literally no repercussions. Drilling a hole through someone's finger, kicking minors in the crotch, throwing men from buildings AND punching women in the face, firebombing a police station, beating someone within an inch of their life and then just driving off, burning down billboards, what else am I missing? 

Then you have this minute long hate speech against the Catholic church literally just as an aside from the writer of the movie because it served no purpose whatsoever. 

I mean my God was this just one, complete let down. Terrible, terrible, terrible.

Edit: Francis abandoning her only surviving child to go murder someone on the word of a disgraced racist drunk, some gorgeous British/Australian bombshell married to someone 20+ years her senior in the middle of bumblefuck America, Francis feeling no compulsion to tell the 19 year old her husband is violent and abusive, Peter Dinklage literally just here to make fun of and help Francis get out of jail after one of the briefest sessions of police questioning ever recorded, the only black woman in town getting arrested for possession of marijuana and then immediately ""getting release on a technicality"" (even though we're supposed to believe the judicial system errs on the side of the police, given that on one cop's recommendation she literally isn't even given bond) and then flying to the side of Francis, why were there EVEN THREE BILLBOARDS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

I will praise the performances (most of them).  I’ll praise the shots.  I’ll praise the editing.  I knew what was going on and where all the subplots went.  I even chuckled at some of the humor.

Frances McDormand was a stick of dynamite with a lit fuse.  I always believed she was going to blow up at any moment and it was great.  I hope she gets nominated.  Sam Rockwell made me dislike him as why I thought would be an antagonist.  Except he wasn’t.

You can’t rapidly oscillate between humor and drama like that without being supremely competent.  I know it was trying to be something in the middle of Lynch and the Cohen brothers, and I praise the ambition.  But the film fell short, in my opinion.

I appreciate that it had a central theme and stuck to it.  They even told us what the theme was:  “anger begets worse anger.”

But the little things tainted it for me. I don’t even mind the fact that people from Missouri had Mississippi and Texas and Georgia and Australian accents.  McDonagh couldn’t get Abbie Cornish to maintain a vaguely Texan accent?  *Zack Snyder* could get her to maintain an accent in *Sucker Punch* and he can’t even talk.

[We have our culprit and DNA evidence for Chief Lester Freamon, McDormand and Rockwell make peace and we end on a shot of the three billboards.  Except it doesn’t end.  So the subplot with the rape suspect went nowhere, but he’s still going to be subject to vigilante justice from Rockwell and McDormand.  They pack a car and drive past a shot of the three billboards...*and it still doesn’t end*.  We have to wrap up McDormand’s arson.  Rockwell is alright with it.  They question the morality of what they do.  They drive off anyway. It finally fades to black and I can go pee.](#spoiler) 

I dunno, maybe I being too tough on the movie, maybe I’m missing something, but I was disappointed.  I felt trolled by Fox. They made the dumb-dumbs think it was going to be another Cohen Brothers film along the lines of *No Country for Old Men*.  And those people were likely suckered in.",7gs4g9

Resulting in the events of the film not being all that impactful. I don't know, that's just the impression I got.",7gs4g9
dqxewiy,"Saw the movie, loved it, one of the top ten of the year for sure, and yet I find myself itching to nitpick it.

*Major Spoilers Ahead*

I think it comes down to me being a little tired of unconventional plots. I get the feeling that Oscar movies, especially in recent years, tend to tell stories that lack a proper structure or conclusion. Like a gift without a bow to tie it all together. *Manchester by the Sea* is a great example of this: the characters don't really go through transformations and there isn't much of a beginning, middle, and end as much as a series of events that kind of happen. It's a great tool for making the bleak seem bleaker.

But the thing is... sometimes I *like* the bow. I don't see myself liking a version of this movie that ends with Sam Rockwell catching the right guy less than the ending we got. I don't see that ending meaning less than the real ending, and it even provides some growth and closure to some characters we've grown attached to. 

I don't think I'm a sucker for ""happy endings"", but earned endings maybe, and I think the ending of *Three Billboards* seemed a bit out of character for both passengers in the car heading to Idaho. I think it'd be simpler and cleaner to just give them the more satisfying ending they were heading toward anyway.",7gs4g9

cinemetagarophy was great, some of the worst writing of the year. Im at a writing school high school and went to one for middle school and i was amazed about how similar the writing of this movie was to 5th grade me. Everything was so hamfisted with no subtetly. [Like when mildred's friend-forgot her name- got arrested she left a sticky note at her work saying ""Got Arrested!"" With a frowny face. Not an official notice, not a ""Closed until further notice"", just fucking ""Got Arrested!"" with a frowny face like she was 10 years old. i genuinelly think i did something like that in my 5th grade story.](#spoiler)

[Also WHO THE FUCK KEEPS A FIREHYDRANT IN THEIR CAR???!?! THEY COULD HAVE HAD SOMEONE ADVISE HER, SAYING ""hey this is controversial, at risk of arson, you should keep a hydrant in your car"" BUT ITS TREATED LIKE A NORMAL THING TO HAVE A WORKING FIRE HYDRANT IN YOUR CAR!](#spoiler) Im sorry if im ranting but as a writer this shit just really annoys me

and mildred was just a dickhead to everyone for no reason, [and gets no punishment or anything at all for burning down a fucking police department, and it isnt treated like a bad thing. I was very confused when she did that, as there was no reason to? cop said he would find who arson'd her billboard? she just threw four fucking molotov cocktails at a cop station cuz she was ""frustrated"" and gets nothing coming to her for almost burning jason alive and burning down the cop station, what the hell](#spoiler)
 amazing acting, but a lot of wasted potential. some scenes were fantastic [like the one where jason goes to beat up red- jesus that was great](#spoiler) but it was stuffed to the brim with filler (understandable for a movie who's plot is just ""Woman Makes Billboard, Cop Mad"" but still, it was annoying. and the pacing was either too fast or too slow, same with the editing.

[also was there any forshadowing for willoughby's suicide at all? it was just completely out of nowhere, and he left a note with some shitty ""i wanted to leave you with a good last memory of me"" excuse, but there has to be more of an excuse like that for a beloved police chief to kill himself and leave his wife a single mother with two young kids](#spoiler)
 And the ending was clunky and mishandled, and completely ignores the ""love is stronger then hate"" meaning of the movie. Boggles my mind this is considered one of the best movies of the year. 

tl;dr horrendous writing, several unintentionally hillarious moments, great cinemtagrophy, great acting, pretty above average directing, too long, full of filler. if you love so bad its good movies watch the first two acts (though the 3rd is a measurable improvement)

Woody Harrelson is 57 and Abbie 36 . They have two young girls. Come on Hollywood directors if you want a movie that supposedly profiles everyday people give him an actress closer to his age with a wrinkle or two.

The speech to the priest was funny and clever in a vacuum (man, did our crowd cheer for that one), but I couldn't help but think that this priest was actually sorta just correct along with everyone else... the billboards weren't doing any good, the Chief was doing everything he could. Why was I supporting her putting up the billboard?


Dixon (Sam Rockwell) felt like a character I was supposed to come around on, but it was also really hard to root for him after what he did to Welby (Caleb Landry Jones, who has been in some good roles this year!). Beating the crap out of him, hitting the other coworker, throwing Welby out of the damn window onto the street, in broad daylight... and that's it? And then I couldn't shake that while I watched the rest of his redemption arc. I just had to accept that the film had chosen to make that act less bad than it really was.


I love that with In Bruges, we had a selfish Colin Farrell and a psychotic Ralph Fiennes, but the movie seemed to acknowledge that these guys had such negative aspects, so I could root along with them nonetheless. With Mildred and Dixon, it felt like I was supposed to be cheering on their negative characteristics as positive. And so it made it hard to really enjoy their characters as much as I wanted to. The dialogue was witty, the characters did entertaining things, but it didn't add up. ",7gs4g9

Practically every scenario, character, etc felt like it was frayed at the edges (i.e. incomplete). I didn't have a problem with the lack of closure regarding the crime, but it certainly felt like McDonagh bit off way more than he could chew with practically every scenario he put before us. Some egregious examples were:  

1. Woody Harrelson's cancer + suicide. It felt forced, unnecessary and irrelevant. Like he's trying to wash away our tears with a fire hose.  
2. The random deus ex machina moment with the soldier, where he describes doing exactly what happened to Mcdormand's daughter, but he....does it to some random girl in a middle eastern country, during (it's implied) the same time frame it happened to Mcdormand's daughter? Uummm, ok.... The reveal that said soldier's DNA didn't match would've been much more effective and realistic if there was a tad bit of ambiguity in the dialogue regarding his actions. Instead, it felt like McDonagh pulled the rug out from under us just so he could do his best impression of Nelson from The Simpsons.

While I loved Frances McDormand (still would prefer for either Sally Hawkins or Margot Robbie to win the Oscar), and liked Sam Rockwell even more, they didn't make such an unforgettable impression as Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, who could easily make you both laugh and cry. However it's probably because the characters are so different. Overall a great movie, 7.5/10.",7gs4g9

Out of the two though, I'd lean Tonya. ",7gs4g9
dqshlts,"Anybody have a weird feeling that it might have been the dad? Not only did he set fire to the billboards and keep telling Mildred to take them down, he also has a girlfriend who could be his daughter. He also has a bad temper which comes fast and shows in one of the few scenes with him and Mildred in private. Seems like if he didn't do it, he might be hiding something he knows. We also are told that he was an ex cop and no one would suspect him, given that he is also Angela's father. I know it's a stretch and by no means the point of the movie, but it is an interesting thing to consider.",7gs4g9

ds1sls4,"Ok, just read several articles and all the threads here. The killer's identity seems very obvious to me and nobody has mentioned it yet.

[The soldier is actually the daughter's killer. We saw him violently confront the mother and confess to the crime. It's got to be him--if he was just another rapist there would have been no motive for him to confront the mother. The only way that makes sense is if he was the daughter's murderer/rapist.](#spoiler)

[That's why the ending is so great. The audience has all the pieces but the characters are still in the dark. Obviously they are going to pull up to the guy's house, and Mildred will recognize him, put it all together, and the mystery will be solved.](#spoiler)

[The real question is why the DNA didn't prove it. Is the new chief of police covering it up? The military? One of those random things where DNA is not 100% accurate? If the director hadn't explicitly ruled it out I would assume they are setting up a sequel.](#spoiler)",7gs4g9
dscgmw0,"Personally my pick for **Best Picture**. This movie was such a great joy to watch, seeing how the characters grow was satisfying in a way that not a lot of movies I've seen this past year quite captured me. It also had balls to not shortcome the essence of Southern culture and how in so many ways parts of it are still stuck on bigoted racism and homophobia, but more importantly on the mentality of justice and violence in rural America. 


Been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell since Moon and he was easily my favorite performance here. The only negative thing I have to say about this film was whoever was in charge of that CGI deer needs a headspace check, the whole scene looked straight out of Roger Rabbit. 


I'm actually glad the ending is left open-ended, although immediately when I watched the film, I'll admit it definitely left me unsatisfied because up until that point the movie does a fantastic job investing you into the story/characters and how tight knit the pacing was going that you really yearned for some closure. After dwelling over it though, the open ending speaks for the entire movie itself about coping with tragedies that may or may never get resolved. If they somehow tied this movie to be based on a true story and at the very end, they showed that the killer was eventually caught years later (as the Chief's letter hopes for) *because* the story got national coverage and some random passerby overheard it in a bar, it probably would have blown my mind.",7gs4g9

He had a proven history of violence, a short temper and is a self confessed arsonist in burning the billboards. Add to this his penchant for younger girls and I think McDonagh was trying to subtly push him as the suspect.](#spoiler)

dqlcyoz,"I liked it a lot. It was surprisingly emotional while still maintains Mcdonaghs trademark irreverence. The performances were fantastic all around. I remember worrying the trailer gave away too much when actually it only covers like the first 30-40 minutes and everything after that is totally surprising and unexpected, and much of it wonderful. Not as good as In Bruges but better than 7 Psychopaths, imo. I do have some issues, plot wise. As good as it is there were a few too many things that didn’t make sense or seemed a little sloppy. How does Dixon throw a man out a window in broad daylight, punch a woman in the face, and continue the assault in the middle of the street with the only consequence being losing his job?  I get that it’s a small town and cops would protect each other but that was pretty excessive. The billboards get set on fire, and she just has a fire extinguisher in her car?  What?  And then they just plaster new paper over the charred billboards?  Silly. The black friend character only existing to get locked up and then released because the “form wasn’t filled out right.”  Etc etc. There are many more examples. Any one or two of them wouldn’t be anything but all combined it leads to some head scratching throughout imo. 9/10",7gs4g9

Woody Harrelson swearing in front of his kids and Frances McDormand telling her daughter that she hopes she gets raped makes it feel like they aren't real people. That made it harder for me to relate when there was more serious moments in the film. I suppose his characters have always been over the top, but I figure it makes for sense for a couple of hitman in Bruges to talk like that than a mom in Missouri telling her daughter to get raped.

Other than that is was still a fantastic movie. It was well acted, funny, thought provoking, sad, and heart warming at times. I just think the tonal issues keep it from reaching the heights of In Bruges, for me.",7gs4g9
drek7k8,"Every once in a while, a movie comes out that damages its predecessors.  Generally, whether it be a sequel/prequel distorting characters or mythos or, as here, a director putting out a movie that damages his or her own credibility.  I genuinely liked 'In Bruges' - the nooks and crannies of the sets were lovely, the jokes landed, the casting was great and the story was unique.  I thought 'Calvary' (while sharing some themes and aesthetics, is directed by Martin Mcdonagh's brother, John) was a movie that invited interpretation - is this character a metaphor for Christ or is it making a mockery of religious people? And I spend an evening talking to my friends about it.  With 'Three Billboards' I didn't really know what to expect.  I was hoping for something more in line with 'In Bruges' but also ready to catch themes or metaphors.  

I didn't find this film as captivating as 'In Bruges.'  It was dark, dreary and in small town Missouri.  Except this wasn't quaint small town Missouri, this is small town Missouri that belongs in early 19th or 18th century Alabama - perhaps when Atticus Finch was still a child.  Sam Rockwell, as an early villain, plays a caricature - he's an extremely racist, incompetent, stupid, violent police officer.  The police chief pats him at one point, not unlike how you might pat a dog that you are trying to calm down after barking at a stranger.  He drinks to excess, violently confronts law abiding citizens about trivial conduct, is generally rude and, to top it all off, lives with his mother.  The few minorities that appear in this film seem to be there to be harassed by this guy.  [After beating an innocent man close to death in full view of the new police chief, nothing happens.  While he does get fired, it seems like it has more to do with being racist and insubordinate than the assault.  Regardless of why he was fired, the police let him back on the streets when he should be in jail.](#spoiler)  The ridiculous and cartoonish portrayal of this character really underscore how ridiculous and cartoonish this movie is - I don't think anyone could take this as a serious portrayal of a real location or real events.

There was something off about the writing - it just seemed bizarre.  The bunny slipper scene was odd.  I get that she was firming her resolve, but the dialogue was so strange it seemed like she was quoting a Rocky movie or something.  Similarly, the tepidly spiritually significant deer scene was a bit off.  It seemed like the director wanted Mildred to appear in touch with nature and appreciating innocent things while resolving to carry on her crusade.  While the two previous movies I mentioned focus on the Church/Pedophilia scandal to varying degrees, it's specific inclusion here felt very forced and almost wrong, like Mildred is using faulty logic.  She draws an analogy between priests and gang members in LA in the 80's.  If you joined the 'gang' you are culpable.  Her analogy isn't more nuanced or detailed than that.  The obvious problem is that this could be applied to any organization you choose to join.  Someone in bridge club committed murder?  Well, you joined bridge club so you are culpable.  It apparently doesn't matter that the club's intended purpose is benign or that the vast majority of members have no knowledge, a poisoned branch ruins the tree.  But there was, or so I thought, some theme or metaphor here.  She is pushing away a potential friend and resource for trying to measure the directness of her message.  She was choosing anger over love, and there were consequences.

I thought that was the over arching theme -  to act with love instead of anger, for, as the saying goes, anger begets more anger.  But that is exactly what the most vapid, naive girl in the movie says.  She read it off a bookmark she was using in a book about polio.... or polo.  The director, almost breaking the 4th wall, bashes on this theme specifically - the obvious analogy was that if this is the theme you are applying to the movie, you are the naive, 18 year old, minimum wage earner of movie viewers.

I can't really comment on the cinematography, I'm not an expert.  I thought the shots were generally dull and dreary, which did match the tone of the movie, so maybe that should win an award.  I was slightly annoyed by some of the shots, like when the camera switched from eyehole in medical wrap to fisheye view of a peep hole on a door and how several shots seemed to jarringly not show the titular three billboards, like the newscast.

There's a lot more to this movie, from the suicide note conscience to the ambiguous ending, questionable police tactics, firebombing, relationships, abuse, etc. etc.... I didn't go into all of it. It's a strange movie, from the caricature of some of the characters to the caricature of small town Missouri, it is hard to take the movie literally.  Yet, it makes fun of the obvious, overarching metaphorical theme.  Instead, it seems to promote a 'you want something done, get angry and do it yourself' from billboards to investigations to vigilante justice.  I've heard it is a serious awards contender so I'll be reading other thoughts, curious as to what I missed so badly.",7gs4g9

dqlrn28,"The acting was superb, but this movie really annoyed me. If I saw it a second time I might change my tune, but going into the film I had no idea that the events would be so unbelievable that I would have a hard time suspending my disbelief. I think it immediately started with Willoughby having cancer, followed by Dixon being a character turned up to 11, Willoughby's suicide, the not-murderer from Idaho, the replacement chief who just so happened to arrive as Dixon threw Red out of window, Dixon getting burned, the entire bar scene (which was filmed SO poorly, and the acting between the Idahoan and his friends SO bad), and the eventual ending of the film. Additionally, after fully realizing that literally nothing else could be done with the case within the first half of the movie, I feel like it just limps along. Where are we supposed to go from there? And then there's no real resolution after the DNA test doesn't work? The ham-fisting of themes in this movie reminded me a lot of Crash, another film I take issue with, where I get what the director is trying to do, but it is never done with a deft hand. One Redditor described this movie as a season of Fargo condensed into two hours, and I can see that. However, this film begins with such realism and emotion that when it slowly starts to unfold I just found myself wanting more and more. With Fargo I know to suspend my disbelief as it generally lets you know pretty quickly that it's going to be goofy.",7gs4g9

dqljr19,"I saw the film for a second time today and there are some standout scenes that elevate the film, but overall, it just struck me as a good movie and nothing more.

The scene where ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" is playing in the background is one of the better scenes this year. The redemption of Rockwell's character was very satisfying and it was rewarding to see a character do all the right things within that moment. But overall, his redemption arc didn't sit all that well with me. He was a racist cop who had a history of brutality and the film puts a good amount of emphasis on him doing the right thing, which creates a stilted outlook on things and left a bad taste in my mouth.

The performances mostly knocked it out of the park, but the writing left me wanting more at times. The confrontation with the new chief and Dixon where he hands in his badge was funny, but at times, it tried too hard to be. Also, side note, but the new  chief's nametag just said Abercrombie, while every other badge had a first and last name on it. I don't know if that was an intentional choice for the character or just a case of McDonagh not wanting to come up with a first name for the character. 

The casting of Willoughby's wife also seemed odd. She very clearly had an Australian accent and the character was fairly one-dimensional, so it felt like there was no reason to cast Abbie Cornish in that role instead of someone who would've sounded like they were from a small town in Missouri.

The fake-out with the guy from Idaho also struck me as odd, when coupled with the early scene in the gift store. The timing of it seemed like it was a few weeks apart from the bar scene, so it seems weird that he'd just be passing through again. And if he was just passing through, why would he have known about her daughter and how would he have the knowledge of where she worked? And even if he was staying in Ebbing for awhile, it still seems odd that he never would've come up as a suspect. Despite his clean record, if he was openly talking about something like that in a bar, that probably wouldn't have been the first time it had been mentioned. It just seemed weird that McDonagh did all that work to convince us it was him and to quickly take it back.

Parts of the story seem to built around being misleading instead of telling a good story and I think it affected the film negatively. Which isn't to say that the film was bad, it was definitely one of the better films this year, but it could've been better.

McDormand, Rockwell, and Harrelson all put forth solid performances and if some changes were made, the movie could've been as good as their performances. Instead, the product was just a good film that is held up by some stellar acting. ",7gs4g9
dqmfya0,"As a huge fan of *In Bruges* who liked but didn't love *Seven Psychopaths,* I will say that *Three Billboards* was my favorite film of the year thus far.

It is an incredibly heavy and dark film, but McDonagh balances drama and comedy perfectly. This movie has some of the best jokes of the year so far, as well as really visually striking direction in the more dramatic scenes. The script is about as good as *In Bruges,* but I think this film is overall better. The performances are so good it is off-the-walls-insane; Frances McDormand will hopefully win Best Actress, and I would like to see Supporting Actor noms for Rockwell and/or Harrelson. Lucas Hedges and Caleb Landry Jones often stole their scenes despite being matched up against such talented, experienced costars.

McDonagh proved with *In Bruges* that he was an incredibly talented writer, but I feel that *Three Billboards* really proved that he is also an incredibly talented director. Already looking forward to seeing whatever he decides to do next.",7gs4g9
dqnanp0,"Overall I thought this film was fantastic, but I also felt like some of the characters’ stories didn’t really end. I’m sure that was at least partially intentional, but it felt in satisfying and strange in a lot of cases. For example, Peter Dinklage’s character never really had a definable personality or role other than “midget who likes Mildred” and I felt bad that he wasn’t more fleshed out and that we last saw him leaving their date angrily.

Also, I have to say, I didn’t care for the ending. I wasn’t really expecting the killer to be found, but it seemed weird that Mildred and Dixon would suddenly have a personal vendetta against an unrelated rapist. It just didn’t really tie into the story that the film had been telling in any meaningful way.",7gs4g9

Anyway when Chief Willoughby says to Mildred that he is dying and she replies she knows it and she still put the billboards and Chief Willoughby leaves we see her disapproving her response I was wondering did she disapprove of it because she felt she is doing the same thing that others did to her ie didn't empathized or because she simply thought it was indecent thing to say to a man who is dying.

2. Talking about throwing the book.. In the same scene I've mentioned above, when Mildred enters his office he panics and tries to hide the book he's reading. The book is Flannery O'Connors 'A Good Man is Hard to Find and Other Tales - Now according to Wikipedia this book contains short stories ranging from baptism to serial killers and violent scenes.

dqljnu8,"Great black comedy that sometimes struggled to find the right balance between the black comedy and drama, but was still excellent overall (and really, really picked up in the final act).

That is to say, some scenes are really trying to emote at you, really trying to make you feel something, and are succeeding, but then a ""dark comedy"" bit is thrown in a way that is too jarring and too first-draft.

Or otherwise, a scene is giving you a great bit of dark comedy, but then wants to get emotional payoff from it, which doesn't work very well.

Probably the greatest black comedy scene ever was the famous woodchipper scene in Fargo.  It succeeds because it works as both black comedy and drama -- you want to scream because it's so horrible, but laugh because it's so darkly funny, and you feel this perfect balance.  It doesn't betray the comedy or the drama, it actually serves both equally.  It's a magic moment.  Every black comedy is trying to get even a hint of that feeling, I think.

Anyway, I have no clue what I'm talking about.  Loved the movie.  Except for the scene with the preacher, where the protagonist went on a tirade against religion.  It was too easy, too easy of a target.  Like punching a baby.  It just didn't land with me.",7gs4g9

Thus the strange characters, plot 'conveniences', bursts of violence.  I have a theory about the ending [if you notice the letter to Sam Rockwell it says 'use patience to be a good cop, well Rockwell is playing the long game not to go after the rapist from Idaho but Frances McDormand who burnt down the police station.

As is usually my case, I would strongly argue that Dixon is as essential to the story as Mildred, thus a leading role and not supporting whatsoever, but it's whatever.

https://letterboxd.com/oneaprilday/film/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/ ",7gs4g9
dqlg8mv,"If you've never seen a film or project staring or featuring Frances McDormand, let this be the first because not only does this show amazing she is but also this has to be the best leading role of her career since ""Olive Kitteridge"" which wasn’t so long ago. Her performance as Mildred Hayes is far more outstanding than Marge Gunderson in ""Fargo."" Granted she's excellent in ""Fargo,"" but I 1) don’t like that movie and 2) she was the thing that powered me through it besides Steve Buscemi.

I have a secret love for Sam Rockwell (as a performer), and here he’s so good that it makes me hate him as he plays this racist prick whose only love is his momma for whom he lives with. This SOB is so detestable that he's one of the best joys of the movie. He's a terrible person, but he's terrific. He's like Uncle Ruckus but just white which pretty much just means he's a redneck racist. He has the racism of Uncle Ruckus and the IQ of Beavis and Butthead. Surprisingly enough his character has this great arc that is unexpected and adds a new layer of the film’s theme of humanity and change. In this violent world, you can see that even the worst people can find their humanity.

dqlidfn,"I saw this at the *Denver Film Festival* a few weeks ago for ~$25, and heard about it on *Colorado Public Radio* a few days before that. Bloody great watch. The humor felt very natural and out-of-nowhere. A scene actually caused me emotional pain. A few others caused concern. Prepare for a roller-coaster.",7gs4g9
dqlp885,How bout that fucking awesome one shot of Dixon fucking up Red. What a film. ,7gs4g9
dqn4umf,"I figured my issue with the movie. I liked the characters, the actors, the jokes, the dips into heavy shit. I think the movie couldn't decide if wanted to be In Bruges/Seven psychopaths or Oscar bait. I was on board until she fire bombed the police station. Then it went from whacky yet believable to trying way too hard.",7gs4g9
dqnpt77,"I was pretty let down by the comedic misfires in this one. I laughed so much during In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths, so you can imagine my disappointment when the jokes all fell flat for me. Still though, the dramatic moments made up for it and the performances really elevated it for me; namely McDormand and Rockwell. ",7gs4g9
dqnz115,"I don't know why but this movie made me think that Martin McDonagh can't make a cohesive movie with a consistent tone throughout if it doesn't include Colin Farrell. The acting didn't seem as natural, the dialogue seemed forced a bit, and the plot just didn't progress as smoothly as it should have. It was a good movie, no doubt. Refreshing to see movies like this doing as well as it is. But I put it third in his filmography, with In Bruges in first and Seven Psychopaths in second. To be honest I liked his short film Six Shooter more than this. ",7gs4g9
dqofu3h,"I enjoyed this movie and thought the acting was superb by all involved. It was refreshing to see Dinklage doing something different, McDormand and Harrelson were wonderful as usual, and Sam Rockwell should win an Oscar. 

I am not understanding the overwhelming opinion about it being a dark comedy, though. The plot was about a horrific subject and largely it had horrific people doing horrific things. Although some dialogue was certainly witty, it was no way a LOL'er. I thought the monologue delivered to the priest was insightful and on point, and people in the theater were guffawing. (Why? Because she used profanity?) 

I walked away with a sense of incompleteness and sorrow and a sense of appreciation for art well executed---certainly not as if I'd been enjoying a real knee-slapper.",7gs4g9
dqvlbdf,"So happy that there's finally a discussion forum for this movie. It's one of the best films I've seen all year. McDormand, Harrelson & (especially) Rockwell were all terrific. I was amazed that it could be hilarious and even, at times, heart-wrenching, sometimes during the same scene. This is one of those movies that I hope scores some major awards love at the Oscars. It's a terrific film!",7gs4g9
drdyqaz,"I greatly enjoyed this movie, but I feel like it was a bit scattered in its setup. There were a lot of relationships to establish and since they were all separate from each other in the film (Sheriff + cops, Sheriff + family, cops w/ each other, Dixon + his mom, Mildred + Robbie, Mildred + Sheriff, etc) it felt a little difficult to get invested.

However, over the course of the film it did a great job deepening the relationships and giving them life, at the expense of some logistical questions here and there and some amazing coincidences towards the end. But this is definitely a movie focused on characters over plot, and it mostly succeeded as a result.",7gs4g9
ds0n3mx,"What was up with the clue, ""sandy,"" that the chief gave to Dixon? Is there any significance or was it just supposed to be a generally broad comment?",7gs4g9
du3xds9,"Really interesting movie, I have felt that way about all the oscar nominees so far which is nice but I expected this one in particular to be more predictable and focus on the mystery of the crime. The actual murder/rape mystery takes a huge backseat to the billboards and how they affect each character from mildred to the police chief, we even see the huge impact it has on her son which didn’t seem too bad at first(if you saw Manchester By The Sea then the character played by the same actor Lucas Hedges has a similar performance but its much more detailed and fleshed out in that movie). I would go more detailed on the film and look at its themes when I watch it again, overall this is a dark comedy by Martin McDonagh but I would consider the story told here a lot more interesting than his previous works. No cheesy gun fights here and my only issue was the shifting tones, for example",7gs4g9
dr0ucx9,"I just got back from watching it tonight. Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were terrific. Even though I thought that Manchester by the Sea was a better movie than this, I am glad that Lucas Hedges is still getting work. Same for Caleb Landry Jones, after seeing him in American Made. Loved the plot twists: The whole movie reminded me of a Coen Brothers movie or the RPG Fiasco. My biggest beefs were 1) [I had a hard time with Dixon's arc. It's mentioned that he is having a rough few years due to his father's passing. Did it go into any reason that I may have missed for the reason for his death? Was there a stated reason for his targeting black folks in the town?](#spoiler) and 2). [I can't get behind the logic of Idaho going into the shop if he is not one of the killers/rapists. Are we supposed to belief that he is, despite the DNA evidence, or are we supposed to believe that he had a random attachment to this case? Is there another interpretation?](#spoiler) Other wise, really enjoyed it. Woody's wife being English? Welsh? New Zealand? was a little annoying but there are some things you got to let go (That's the theme of the movie, yeah??)",7gs4g9
dqldp4f,"I was shocked when this movie ended. It felt so abrupt and for a second I was disappointed, but after thinking about it, I loved it. Sure, they won’t get the resolution they’ve been looking for. In many ways, things are worse than they were before. But what’s important is that they’re working together, and they’re trying something. 

Such a fantastic movie. In such a divisive time, this message is what we need to hear. ",7gs4g9
dqllsfn,"OK but not great

I have seen so many films this year that try to juggle too many stories and IMO suffer for it, this one, Ladybird, Detroit, Mudbound.

I can’t help but feel as though the current social climate had something to do with that. I might be projecting, but the laughs felt like audience members were saying, “it’s true, we should do that.”

And by the way, in the wake of the rape and murder of Christa Worthington in 2002, local police actually did go out and take the DNA of every man in town. It eventually led to the arrest of her killer (who turned out to be a sanitation worker whose route went past her home).",7gs4g9

Sam Rockwell’s arc was so fascinating to watch. He plays a drunk idiot so perfectly. Anyone who has spent time in rural America is going to love his and Woody’s character as they exemplify the best and worst aspects of “good ole boys”.

My only complaint is that Frances McDormand is a LITTLE TINY BIT too clever for everyone. She definitely has her flaws but it just doesn’t fit the attitude of the rest of the movie.

dqn5i4s,"I've done no research on this video so I have no idea if it's based off of real events or not. But I got the sense at the end of the movie that we watched an origin story on a serial killer duo.

Obvious spoilers but the progression of violence to the very ending at how they left it just kinda gives the feeling that they're about to go on a killer rampage. Starting from the beginning to where she says something along the lines of ""we should put every guy in a book that does something wrong then kill them"", to then assaulting the dentist, to then arson, to then finally agreeing to drive out to kill what they believe is a rapist, making me wonder what would be beyond that?

Nothing really bad against it as it's a realistic movie.",7gs4g9
dqogo5h,"Great movie but I had some problems with some over the top plot points 

The sheriff killing him self was absolutely not needed. The hate on mildred could have easily continued without the need of making her look bad after he died. It was way too over the top for a relatively calm movie. 

Setting the police station on fire was a bit over  the top too.  And we never got any resolution as to the whole thing about that was. 

The racist cop, he wasn’t a needed character, he felt a bit extra and unnecessary. They shoulda just made him the comic relief goofball who wants to be a detective. And solving the case redeems him. 

I was not pleased with the ending. I get that they wanted to show the whole morality of “he’s still a rapist so let’s go get him” but the whole movie felt like it was for nothing at that point. If she wanted the case solved she shouldn’t have burnt the station down. Because the case was never solved why did they make such a big deal of the cop saving the case files to begin with. The guy that was the rapist should have been the real rapist for a ending that was worth it. 

The dads girlfriend was ridiculous and just straight up stupid. 

The movie was grounded in real life America, but some of the over the top points and characters. Made it too off.

Beating on some defenseless people in an immature, grief stricken moment in the most unhealthy way possible wasn't his defining moment. 

His defining moment was his change, his showing of his true self, his growth, and his humanity. He had a few of those. Off the top of my head, I've got 4 or 5: 1. throwing out Angela's file while he's burning, knowing it'll catch fire if he's engulfed in those flames, 2. putting down his shot gun and caressing his sleeping mother's head, 3. in the hospital crying for forgiveness in front of Red, 4. heroically accumulating (and taking a beating for it) the evidence on the suspect in the Angela Hayes case, 5. telling Mildred he knew she was the one who burned him but didn't have any ill will towards her.",7gs4g9
dqnbav1,"Yes! Favorite scene for me by far.

dqurd0r,"Nah, they're just setting up a sequel. Didn't you see the after credits scene?",7gs4g9
dqmc99k,"I think the point is that we don't know. I think one of the central themes of this movie is choice. Choice is what dictates the major elements of the film. You have overt choice like Willoughby choosing to kill himself that slaps you in the face with the theme. Then you have the more telling choices like Mildred choosing to burn down the police station and we see that if Dixon didn't choose to grab the case file on the daughter, her choice would have literally burned her daughter's case. When Dinklage's character James calls Mildred out he basically says that everything has always been her choice and she acts like her hand has been forced. And right after that we think she's going to be Mildred and beat the hell out of either her ex or his girlfriend, but she chooses not to.   
  
What I'm getting at is McDonagh purposefully put that ambiguity of the gift shop scene in there. He's leaving that choice to the viewer. Was he a rapist? Was he just a liar? The film ends with Mildred and Dixon saying they don't know if they should kill the guy. They decided to make the choice on the way there and in that conversation the film completes its arc. Instead of being filled with conviction that they know the Truth, they instead admit that they are uncertain and allows themselves to be vulnerable to each other.   
  
If we as an audience had definitive proof that the guy wasn't or was guilty I think it could have diluted that message. We needed to be in their position of uncertainty to feel the weight of their eventual choice. Instead of giving us an answer, the movie ends and we make the choice just like the main characters. I thought it was a brilliant way of taking the core themes of the film and thrusting them on the audience in a way that leaves you uncomfortable. ",7gs4g9
dqllc26,[deleted],7gs4g9
dqlk8am,"I think its easier to believe that he is just a freak who gets off on murder stories. 

Dig into any famous killing and you will find a bunch of creeps who admit to doing it despite not being anywhere near the place where it occured.  A lot of them will also harass the families of the victims (many murdered kids parents end up getting creepy phone calls from complete strangers saying they know what happened or claiming to be the dead kid;  people are fucked up) 

I think the guy just didnt get the respect he thought he would automatically be due upon becoming a soldier and is pissed about it. 

Maybe he is a rapist;  but I definitely dont think he killed anyone. More likely he is just a fucked up guy who read the story in a newspaper and decided to manipulate a grieving mother because it made him feel superior.",7gs4g9

dqyd9yt,"I think they did the scene so two things could happen:

1) there’s context for who he is at the bar scene

2) It gives the audience hope that he could be the killer since we hope he’s the guy that Woody refers to as “an idiot who tells the story of the murder in a public place”. 

That way, at the end when you find out he’s not the killer, it throws the audience for a loop because we all expected a tied up ending thanks to a Chekhov’s gun but it was actually a red herring. 

Honestly, I liked they used that to make the audience assume the resolution incorrectly giving the movie a unique twist that’s less “I didn’t see that coming!” And more “Aww that sucks. I thought it was going to be him, but I guess that’s real life sometimes!”",7gs4g9

Is it about a girl that was raped while dying? is it about injustice? Is it about terminal illness? Is it about three fucking billboards? What on earth was this movie attempting to convey?",7gs4g9
drwhbgc,"To me, i's about how we all muddle through life while looking for purpose, whether or not it's there. Sometimes terrible things happen, and sometimes we fail. Sometimes we try our best, and sometimes we're flawed.

It doesn't have a single point, per se, but is just a reflection of how people deal with life when life gets difficult.

There are two scenes in particular that made me cry:

One was Willoughby's final moments.  I think it made me cry because: He tried his best. He tried to be a good chief. He wasn't perfect. He couldn't get rid of racism or homophobia in his force, and he couldn't solve the case. Maybe he didn't deserve Mildred's scorn. He certainly didn't deserve to get terminal cancer. But that's just life sometimes.

The other was the scene in the hospital with Dixon and Red, when Red gave Dixon the orange juice. I loved that little bit of human decency, the sense that we're all in it together... helped in this case that these two are literally both in bandages together.

Thinking about those scenes made me cry again when I was driving home.

And I wasn't crying about any particular sad event in the movie. I was crying because, well, like, the human condition, man. :P

* * *

As for the motivations of the characters, I see Dixon as someone who clearly hasn't grown up in the best environment with the best resources, and he's angry at the world. He has loyalties, like to Chief Willoughby. He wants to have a sense of purpose. When he's fired, he literally has no idea what he's supposed to be doing.  He doesn't realize what he's lost until he loses it.

I see Mildred as someone who's not that different from Dixon, really. She's also a very flawed person who has trouble dealing with others. She's wracked with guilt over her daughter's death, and she's expressing it by lashing out with anger at others. Of course, it's not really her fault, and she's also angry at the injustice of the world.

They're both trying to find their place in a world that they don't feel they fit into.

* * *

Thanks for giving me a chance to work out my own thoughts about the movie! :)  I knew it hit me emotionally, but this sort of let me clarify in my own mind why that is.

It's all summed up by when Mildred asks the deer why there haven't been arrests yet:

*'Cause there ain't no God, and the whole world's empty, and it doesn't matter what we do to each other? I hope not.*",7gs4g9
dsnlo4i,"I'm with you. I thought the whole thing was way over the top and all the character development was too forced. 

Felt like a movie written by some clever hipster from Queens who has never been to the countryside but wanted to make a film about people and way of life there.

dsqnu6b,"Anger can be a healthy thing when it fuels properly thought out actions. But when anger overwhelms you - like with John Hawkes character, Sam Rockwell's, even at times Frances McDormonds - it can lead to pointless horrible violence and loss of self. Woody's letters showed how thoughtful he was, of his diligence and his true, peaceful nature. He was forgiving to a fault because he saw the good in people and his letters actually helped bring everyone back together. Love conquers hatred if you let it (see how Frances reaches out to Woody when he's sick, and to Hawkes mere moments after being grabbed by the throat).

I loved it. Will be thinking about it for a long time.",7gs4g9
drxi50m,"That's interesting, but for me there may be no justice in the murder of the suspect/soldier. Without a doubt, he's true scum. But as the new chief pointed out, this asshole soldier who bragged about pouring gasoline on a girl he raped may have been a lie to impress his friend. There's no telling if it's true or not. 

The impunity angle is also interesting and may have some creedence to the fact this is a guy that travelled to a war torn country and probably could get away with a lot. But we don't know.

That's why the last scene of the movie had so much impact. They weren't sure but at least there was hope for justice, even if it only lasts a day.

dsphjba,"Definitely. I'm going to try to explain myself as best as I can:
 Something I specially loved and appreciated is the fact that she's not just ""a leading female role"" to make people contempt about the current Hollywood situation, but she's a whole character herself, a whole person, with flaws, motivations and a million angles. I just feel that she was written as a character, -what mostly men actors get- not only as a ""female leading role"". ",7gs4g9
dvbh98e,Fleabag — a series on amazon — is so good for this very reason. Definitely recommend.,7gs4g9
dsu942n,"> The only unfortunate thing is while I could imagine many actors in the roles of Dixon or Willoughby, it is hard to think of many actresses who could play Mildred. Hopefully Hollywood gets more diverse and starts writing better roles for women. Having more female protagonists is one thing, we also need a lot more female anti heroes. 

If you want a good female anti-hero watch Forbrydelsen.  It's a Swedish/Danish crime drama, and it's on Netflix (in the UK at least).  Season 1 is 9/10 television.  Season 2 is 5/10 (bang average).  Season 3 is a return to form 8/10.

If you don't wanna proceed with Season 2, just skip it and read a synopsis, the over-arching effects of that season are very minor and don't impact on 3.

Interestingly, both actresses said they based their performances on men.",7gs4g9
dveguk2,"I agree quite a bit. This guy raped someone and burnt their body and even went to Mildred’s work. They did foreshadow a lot when the chief died and said someday someone will brag in a bar.. they told us this is what will happen. The man said his friends watched and I have wondered if he in fact wasn’t one of the friends who was watching and we never saw who the killer was? Maybe that explains the dna not being his, maybe he wanted credit for it. Either way I agree he was a participant. Great movie.",7gs4g9
dvib43f,Really interesting take. I haven't considered this before!,7gs4g9
dw0z4cq,It was definitely the guy in the bar. The theme of this movie is moral ambiguity. Each character has moral and immoral sides to them. Every single one. They even made Dixon’s mother a racist. Except Abercrombie. So why is that? He MUST have something immoral about him. And what is that?  It’s the cover up of the military for the murder. It’s 100% what the movie is going for here I’m sure of it. ,7gs4g9
dvfpwp7,"You make an interesting case, I hadn't thought about that at all.  Maybe because I'm not totally disenfranchised with law enforcement, or the fact that the new chief seemed like a moral superior, after what he did.
 I'm sure Abercrombie talked to Dixon after the fire, and realized the dude did have a change of heart? Like wouldn't he be thinking that Dixon started the fire, but if he rescued the Hayes file, that he must be changed in his excommunication from the force? I guess I was just assuming that the new chief was incorruptible, but I do like your interpretation. ",7gs4g9
dwyzsx1,"Well this explains why Dixon, having the realization that Abercrombie is covering up for that rapist, suddenly ""found"" his badge and gave it back, like he had a realization that it's no use and must have lost hope in the system and justice, and that must have been why he almost tried to kill himself?

dxcjoh1,"  The guy didn't rape Angela; he likely raped a civilian woman or prisoner of war in Afghanistan/Iraq. It's not spelled out but we know the guy was in the military, that he was somewhere sandy, and that weirdly enough, gasoline and fire were involved in the rape, which sounds bogus unless you think of wartime. 


  He tells his bar friend he raped a girl ""9-10 months ago"". This corresponds to when he was still in active duty right before he came back. Perhaps because he was discharged. Or maybe wartime was ceasing. Either way, the guy is a sociopath and a sadist. If he's the kind of guy who would rape a woman while fighting in the Middle East and brag about it to a friend then he would probably be the kind of guy to be sickly intrigued by the content of the billboards and would get a kick out of causing suffering by fucking with Mildred. I personally think this was included to make the ending more ambiguous, and I'm fine with that even though causally it doesn't make the most sense.

The dialogue really took me out of it nearly all the way through. It was just too crude. The wife saying ""you have a great cock"", the son calling the mother a cunt, the ""I hope you get raped"". I'm not a prude but this kind of dialogue needs to be used in the right context.

If it was one character then you could just think ""it's a crudely-drawn comic caricature side-character"" but it was the whole town. It reminded me of being in the first year of university in the common room with some ""larger than life"" characters who had just found out they can swear without being told off.

The performances were good, great in places but again with the shallow depth of the dialogue and characterisation were kind of wasted.

There was also a lot of sentimentality and telling the viewer how to feel. She might have a heart of gold and have experienced pain but burning down a police station means she needs to go to jail. I don't get why that didn't figure in the film at all - it just made it seem like a writer first / plot point first / entertainment first empty piece with no authenticity.

dsu8yc8,">out-of-place ex-husband's girlfriend

She's the idiot of the film.  The ex-husband chasing after an impressionable young 19-year-old who literally walks in on a woman being physically abused and he reaction is: ""Err... I'll go wait outside"" just emphasises the constant motif of 'morally ambiguous' -- she cares more for animals, than a woman being abused in front of her.  She's also comic relief for that scene, and lets the tone change.

On top of that, she delivers the whole didactic of the film: ""Love begets love"", or the opposite: ""Anger begets anger"".

>Chief Willoughby's wife's confusing accent

Why is everyone strung up on an Australian accent?  Is it really *that* hard to believe that Harrelson's character could've snagged someone on holiday (or whatever).

Besides, it serves as the opposite of Mildred's ex-husband: despite an obvious age difference, if you treat her with love, she'll become a good Mother.  They have two kids, just like Mildred, but the kids seem remarkably sweet, and the family is very well put together (at least until their Daddy commits suicide).  

>the existence of the gift shop scene

No defence there.  Other than the guy being a bit of a loony.  If he really was a rapist in Afghanistan though, the billboards probably triggered some PTSD or some shit, and he doesn't want to me reminded of it.  He doesn't mind bragging 'to the boys', but 'the boys' aren't there when you're driving alone on a road to town and are faced with the reality of what you actions might do to real people.

>how on-the-nose the scene when Rockwell overhears the alleged rapist was

I'm not quite sure what you're saying here.  But, this was foreshadowed in Harrelson's letter: ""You might hear someone in a bar bragging about something"". Unless you're saying that it's *too* perfect, of course.

We initially have sympathy for Mildred based purely on her situation but her actions illicit no sympathy really; all her righteous anger achieved was harm. We get a major clue about this early on when she basically suggests that chief Willoughby infringe on people's civil rights to find the assailant. Mildred is so caught up in her revenge that she is willing to justify any harm to achieve justice. Even the Billboards aren't really justifiable as it seems there isn't much else the police can even do.  
  
I don't think it's fair to say ""the film glosses over his actions"". We're presented with both sides of Dixon: an angry cop who throws a guy out of a window purely because he doesn't like the guy AND a person who is willing to endure pain to help someone else. Human beings aren't simple and this film shows that in a way that not many do.

Obviously, there was no DNA match, but when he was telling the story in the bar he mentioned that there was a group of them raping Angela. My theory is that the soldier was present but did not actively partake. This would dove-tail incredibly nicely with Mildred's speech to the Priest about how if you're in the gang you are culpable! This theory would add so much to this scene and explain the soldier character really well.

I really disagree with this. 

I mentioned it in my post, but McDonagh's strength in his plays and in previous films is that he's incredibly adept at using Chekhov's gun in a natural way. In *In Bruges*, the change Ken isn't allowed to use when he goes to the top of the churchtower at the beginning of the film is the very change he sprinkles from the same church tower before jumping later on in the film. 

*Three Billboards* was nowhere near as tight as *In Bruges* and I wouldn't even say it beat out *Seven Psychopaths* either. 

How does Dinklage's character tie into anything? He just appears, has a crush on her, serves as a useful joke to go on the date with her, then pretty much disappears. Lucas Hedges' character appears and disappears when convenient, not really having an effect on anything except to make a joke or have someone for McDormand to play off. 

And, as far as dialogue goes, I think the dialogue in this is as weaker than in either of the other films. I half-heartedly chuckled at the Penelope lines, but they were hardly any better than things you'd see on an HBO comedy. Even the scene from the beginning of the film when Frances McDormand's character goes to rent the billboards and there's the ""So, you're Angela Hayes' mother?"" ""Yeah, I'm Angela Hayes' mother."" is the sort of lazy writing that McDonagh normally sends up. 

Think of the scene in *Seven Psychopaths* where Walken is approached by the gangsters and they tell him to put his hands up. He non-chalantly says ""No."" 

""But I've got a gun,"" the gangster says. 

""I don't care,"" Walken says. 

""But -- but it doesn't make sense!""

""Too bad.""

That's a great scene because it flips our expectations. We're so used to characters just putting their hands up whenever another character has a gun. It's tired, it's played out. That exchange points that out and gets a legitimate laugh. 

Even the rhythmic repetition of the ""cunt-fucking kids"" scene in *In Bruges* makes for interesting dialogue. The way Harry Waters calls his wife an ""inanimate fucking object"" then appears only seconds later with an utterly calm tone saying ""I'm sorry I called you an inanimate fucking object"" is just funny. 

Very little of *Three Billboards* felt that real or that interesting. The ""colored-person torturing business"" scene did, but that's about it. ",7gs4g9

My main issue is how paper-thin most of the characters are. Mildred, Dixon and Willouhby have a *little* bit of depth, but everyone else exists only to execute specific plot points.

Dinklage's character, for example. The dwarf character in ""In Bruges"" at least served a narrative purpose. Here, the dwarf exists just to be called a midget and to be, miraculously, the only human within walking distance of the police station at the exact moment Mildred is firebombing it. It seriously makes me question the intelligence level of a writer who, apparently, just enjoys making midget jokes.

Another example - the black guy who helps put up the billboards. He exists only to inform Mildred that the advertising company made unnecessary duplicates of the billboards (that's *definitely* not how that works) and to be attracted to the only black female in town so they can both, miraculously, be at the same bar as Dixon when he's assaulted.

There were really no truly moral characters in that film, besides Red (the advertising salesman). When he realized that Rockwell's character was in the hospital with him, any other character in that film would have responded with anger, which would only complicate and escalate the situation. 
However, instead, Red offers Rockwell's character a peace offering, the orange juice. I believe this event galvanized the change we see in the other characters. It was not that the characters were experiencing a moral redemption, but rather the violence that previously defined and guided them was mollified, thus breaking the cycle of anger besetting more anger.

That felt too real for me. It was super uncomfortable to experience that, and while I love me the film I do not think I could watch it again. It was a brilliant film that made me feel awful.",7gs4g9
dqm1pq5,"I'm with you. I really like the idea of what the film is going for, but I don't think it earns any of it in any way. I didn't buy anything the movie was selling.

The film is just a bunch of scenes happening with little to no consequences that matter. We keep hearing about ""THE TOWN"" not liking McDormand's billboards, but aside from maybe a very small handful of scenes, there's no real reaction to it. It's mainly just Harrelson and Rockwell going against her, and barely at that. Rockwell is a racist cop? Well there's only three black people in the movie, and he only arrests one off screen. 

And then, most of all, I do not for a second buy that Rockwell's character went through anything that calls for a change in his character. It was like night and day. Yes, the fire is supposed to be a symbolic cleanse for him, but on a purely narrative level it does not work. 

There's some good things in here (I really like the scene where Harrelson coughs up blood on an antagonistic McDormand who immediately turns into a maternal figure), but it's covered with a meandering film that never really coalesces. ",7gs4g9
dt05gli,"Had to scroll way down to finally see a negative comment. I agree. The movie wasn't bad, it was just way too over the top. Rockwell' character throwing a kid out of a building, and just getting fired? 

The dentist's finger? 

The weirdo in the gift shop. Then he shows up at same place as Rockwell and talks loud enough in a loud bar for Rockwell to hear him?

Idk..everything just felt too scripted. Like the characters were caricatures. Way too on the nose as others have stated. And the score was really weird. Sounded like a lifetime movie score. Not a bad movie, but I don't get all the praise. ",7gs4g9
dqlje3u,"It was underwhelming to me as well. McDormand and Rockwell were great, but the movie spent so much time driving home how (nearly) the entire cast was morally gray and wanted the audience to be impressed with that as an end rather than as a means to telling a great story.",7gs4g9

The fact that they both admitted they didn't even know if they wanted to go murder that scumbag shows how much they've grown. Sam Rockwell doesn't feel the need to be violent and Francis McDormand is finally starting to forgive herself instead of taking it out on all the wrong people.

And then like before, they plan to let out their anger on the ""wrong"" people (he is a rapist, just not the one they're looking for), but the end shows both have evolved in character because they're second guessing their decision, calling back to the ""Anger begets more anger"" scene earlier.

dqzp4mx,"I too am baffled that this is a supposed frontrunner for awards season. It was shockingly bad in my eyes. 

I have about 30 gripes with the film, from story to technical gripes. 

Why did Dixon and Mildred get away with the numerous crimes they committed? Dixon broke into and vandalized the ad agency, as well as attempted to murder Red in broad daylight. Mildred assaulted a dentist, assaulted HIGH SCHOOL KIDS in front of parents, and burnt down a police station. 

What was the son’s relationship with his dad? One second he’s excited to see him then the next he has a knife to his throat, where’s the consistency? 

Peter Dinklage didn’t report Mildred for burning down a police and almost killing Dixon because? He already noticed she was a self-centered person. He had all reason to believe she intentionally committed attempted murder and he just disappears out of the story in a huff?

Are we in a stylized world or is this the real world? The film can’t seem to decide. One second it wants to be Tarantino/Coen Brothers, then the next it’s trying to be a serious, grounded drama. You can’t do both without it being jarring. The father’s 19 year old girlfriend was particularly strange. She felt straight out of a screwball comedy and she interrupts a very serious scene of a man strangling a woman? 

Why was Mildred’s friend arrested? That went nowhere. The Mom suggesting “screw over her friends” was so forced and then SOMEHOW Mildred knew the Mom said this? HOW DID SHE KNOW THIS? She walks into the police station like “getting coached by your momma, Dixon?”. Which would be a normal snarky thing to say if the scene directly before didn’t show us that he actually was! That was very odd.

The priest scene was one of the most forced scenes I’ve ever seen. It was so forced, that it didn’t even feel like Mildred talking. It felt like McDonagh using his character as a soapbox to stand on and shout shit about the church. Then the church never gets brought up again?

The much talked about gift shop scene with the rapist was also terrible. Okay, so this guy who raped and set a girl on fire in the exact same time frame that Mildred’s daughter was raped and set on fire, waltzes into her gift shop just to taunt her? Then later brags about his 10 month ago rape to some friend in a bar? (I’m not saying it doesn’t exist, but I doubt there are many friend groups that would be cool with a guy raping and setting a girl on fire. Really? This guy has a friend who hears this and is okay with it?) But despite all these similarities to Mildred’s case, it isn’t the guy. Okay? We had no reason to doubt it. Literally everything was perfect. The reveal that he isn’t the guy just felt like such a cheap shot that the movie lost me completely.

I could go in forever, the story was a mess.

Even from a technical perspective it had lazy editing, uninspired cinematography and they straight up missed the focus on multiple shots! I haven’t seen that in a high profile production. It felt very amateur.

I love dark comedies. I love movies where consequences don’t line up with the character’s actions. The Coen brother’s do this sort of nihilism brilliantly, Burn After Reading is a particular favorite of mine. 

The fact of the matter is, everything about Three Billboards is half baked. It can’t commit to its comedy or drama and both suffer for it. For every good performance, there’s bad dialogue and hamfisted jokes. The plot relies on conveniences and red herrings.

In Bruges did everything this movie is attempting but actually succeeded. Do people think this is a good movie just because that’s the popular opinion? Is no one trying individual thought? This movie crumbles under any scrutiny. I’m usually pretty open to subjective opinions, but some of this film’s flaws are too glaring for it to be hailed as one of the year’s best.",7gs4g9

I don't understand how the deer scene made it past the final cut. Maybe I'm a snowflake, but I got a pretty strong classist vibe throughout as well.      

Things I liked: The acting was pretty good. I really have to be honest, beyond the dudes that could make reading a Subway Menu into art (McDormand, Dinklage, Harrelson) Rockwell brought the A-game. 

Its funny you mention the scene where he threw the guy out the window. I had a good friend commit suicide last year. The scene itself is obviously ridiculous, but that's exactly it. I was angry. Way more angry than sad. I am a huge fan of self-control and not being ""emotional,"" but I was mad to the point of where I could feel it in the back of my head above the brain-stem, almost like a physical manifestation of hatred in my head. It was overpowering. And it was constant for days and intermittent for months afterwards. And with a suicide you don't have anywhere to put all that anger. It just festers. I didn't throw anyone out of windows, but it took all the self-control I had not to explode on people for no reason. That searching anger where you are trying to find someplace to put it, on someone or something ""responsible,"" that his close to home. So I have to give them that.

I have no problem with a movie filled with unlikeable characters. That's pretty much McDonagh's style; creating a motley crew of people who do mostly bad things.

But I can't forgive how paper-thin and unnatural most of these characters are. Everyone's raving about McDormand's performance, and she certainly does commit to the intensity of it, but there's not much more there besides that intense fury. She has the one really weird scene with the CGI deer, but otherwise she's in a constant simmering rage.

And I felt the ""turn"" for Rockwell's character was completely unearned. He goes from a cartoonish racist to a somber, well-intentioned detective in the blink of an eye. And worst of all, we're asked to root for him by the end of the film. Ridiculous.",7gs4g9

My biggest issue was with the “alleged” rapist seeking out Mildred and pretty much saying “I did it.” And then bragging about it at the bar (which, also, I had an issue with that scene because like if it was so empty why sit next to someone and get pissed they might be overhearing your conversation?) (and also raping a girl and lighting her on fire just doesn’t seem like something you’d pretend to do and brag about it? Maybe? I dont know). All of that just to say, nope he didn’t do it. 

I get it, life isn’t always fair, there’s not always Justice in life. I /get it/. But it just seemed like an illogical twist...

Anyway, I agree. Acting was superb. Plot, not so much. Not awful, but there were too many moments where I was sitting there going “What? Why?

dsolr5z,"> No conclusion, no real meaningful commentary on society. 

Life doesn't have a conclusion. Things don't wrap up nicely. No one is wholly good or bad. That's what I got from this film.

At the start it seems like a simple case of corrupt cops and a woman going on a valiant crusade against corruption, to find a killer, etc etc. But throughout the film we slowly learn that everyone is a bit of a prick, and the ones that were major pricks end up doing some good stuff. Dinklage's character was a bit of a prop, but I still think he served the purpose to show how much of a prick the main Mildred could be.

I took the film as a commentary on how messy morality is and how, even when we try to do something good, we often fuck up and it can turn out to be the wrong decision. And even people who fuck up can go on to try to do good things.

I think that was reflected in the dialogue too. It was messy and people went off on tangents, and repeated themselves. Just like real people do. I found it a breath of fresh air against films with perfectly punctuated scripts, etc. It was like the difference between a perfectly produced studio album where everything is mixed together so that there's no confusing of sounds, everything is crisp, and fits in the mix together; it was like the difference between that and a live recording of a band where you can hear them fuck up and express themselves in ways that aren't captured on a pitch perfect studio record.",7gs4g9

Many of the performances were very good, especially Rockwell (even if I don't necessarily like the way his character was written), there were some very funny lines, and I loved the score.  But I generally just found it to be a really problematic movie.  Obviously the big one everyone's talking about is Dixon's unjustified redemption arc, and I have to agree completely.  His character did horrible things on screen and off, but just because of Willoughby's letter (which didn't seem to accurately reflect either character) he suddenly becomes a character were rooting for?  Why is he not punished for throwing someone out a window?  Why is ""person of color torturing"" played for laughs?  And on the topic of race, how about the token black friend getting sent to prison and released with no questions asked apparently, and then hooking up with that other token black guy?  I could go on and on, but what's the point, really.  And on top everything, so much just didn't make sense.  Why did the other bad guy show up to threaten Mildred when he has literally no ties to Willoughby, the town, anything?  How the hell did Red and Dixon wind up in the same hospital room?  Why does Willoughby have a really young hot Australian wife?  And just generally why does *no one* get in trouble for the insane amount of crime going on in this town?

Mildred assaults a couple high school kids with dozens of witnesses around and it is never investigated.  Mildred firebombs the police station and it is never investigated.  Everyone knows Dickson tortured someone in custody and it is apparently never investigated.  Dickson assaults Red with dozen of witnesses and it is never investigated.

Sam Rockwell's character gets fired as a direct result of his actions (if that's seen as an appropriate consequence for a cop who violently beats two people, throws one out a window and puts him in the hospital, and destroys a decent amount of their office, I guess), but the rest of the bad things that happen to him happen by chance or because of Mildred's actions, not his own. The sheriff doesn't see consequences for continuing to employ (and for some reason mentor) a racist, violent cop, and her abusive ex husband doesn't see any consequences for being abusive. He almost gets an apology, which is insane. 

That deer scene had some bad, bad dialogue. If it had half the lines or was just completely silent it could've been really strong, but that was a major dropped ball.

Also really, really disliked the fact that Sam Rockwell's history of abusing black people was repeatedly used as a laugh line. ",7gs4g9

Ben Affleck kills a totally innocent person while he robs a bank, plays the sympathy card all movie and then gets a nice happy ending by robbing more people. It's awful. He's never punished and he never seems especially changed by the experience, but he is still treated as the flawed but shining protagonist. 

In 3 Billboards, Dixon's redemption is totally plausible because he is both punished for what he's done and atones for it by changing his ways. Beyond that, Dixon's motivation for doing douchey things is not so self centered. He adores Willoughby and the crimes he commits are related to trying to please either him or his own mother. Once Willoughby is dead and Dixon reads his letter, he is able to see what is genuinely correct, not just his own corrupt ideas on how to please people. So yes, in the end, even  though Dixon starts out as a total shithead, we can feel bad for him because it's clear that he's changed.

This isn't the 1850s, this small town police dept is getting sued for 10 million dollars and the guy who did it is going to federal prison.  Yet, later that day every one is surprised he's getting fired.  And if it's obvious that someone set fire to the police station they are going to do a bit of investigating about that.

dqqg4l6,"Answers. We're supposed to see the movie through the context of ""hate"" and ""forgiveness"". A cycle of hate is started by the murder of Angella Hayes. 

* He got away again. The police, repeatedly shown to be incompetent, either fucked up the blood work or just don't care. I get more into that further down.

* The movie revolves around a cycle of hate. Mildred''s speech is analogous to this. Each character chooses whether to light fires or put them out. Everyone who participates in the cycle of hate is culpable in all of its results.

* Because you're supposed to hate him at first. You as the viewer decide whether to forgive him. You're supposed to wrestle with who he is as a character and, in the end, resolve your feelings. Dixon is a racist because the movie is challenging you to forgive a man **you** hate. But the characters forgive him; Mildred, Red, Dinklage's character, and even the black guy that puts up the Billboards.

* Dinklage had several purposes in the film. Most importantly, he was instrumental in showing Mildred that her anger is hurting the people around her. He also helps to bring Dixon over, forgiving him and puting him out when he's on fire.

* He's there as an instigator. He's participating in the cycle. So is Mildred. Mildred *forgives* him for the numerous times he's hurt her. This is arguably the most important part of her character arc. We think she's going to hit him with the bottle but she offers it to him instead.

* Because the police are incompetent. Dixon gets away with torturing a man and throwing another out of a window. Mildred''s friend gets out of jail because the police fucked up the paperwork. Angella's murderer isn't even investigated. The police do **nothing**. This is to set up the ending, where the murderer's blood work was either botched or not tested at all. The police don't care and won't do their jobs. The dentist thing is just one more evidence of this.

* I addressed this in the above. The police in this movie suck.

* Willoughby forgives Mildred for the inflamatory Billboards. He's also instrumental in pulling Dixon out of the cycle of hate with his letter. You may recall that Willoughby's letter caused Dixon's heel-face turn. Willloughby is one of the many characters that demonstrates what it means to be part of the solution.

I found this movie to be phenomenal. I've seen it twice and I absolutely love it. I thought it was hilarious and brilliant and I hope I can get you to see it this way as well with a rewatch.

Its story is of a viscious cycle of anger, hate, and fire. Those who participate just cause more pain. The film offers ""forgiveness"" as the solution and as a way out. Every character serves as either an angry, hateful person or as a forgiver. The movie revolves around this as these forgivers show Dixon and Mildred how to move on. The abrupt ending of the movie asks us if they can forgive an evil rapist as well.

",7gs4g9
dqq4eeo,"I'm right there with you. So much of the dialogue felt clunky, too on the nose, and by and large cringeworthy (the flashback to the daughter and the ""I hope you get raped!"" exchange pained me). I've read a great deal of McDonagh's theatre plays and the man knows how to craft smart, darkly demented characters but these absolutely fell flat for me. I think a large part has to do with his total lack of familiarity with the demographic. The man is born and raised in Ireland, which is where his writing really shines. And he definitely did a great job capturing LA for Seven Psychopaths--but when it came to small-town Midwest... yikes. And as far as whatever the hell social commentary he was shoehorning in every other second regarding race, sexuality, police brutality, rape culture, and on and on--yikes x yikes!!!

I honestly don't understand how an intelligent audience can see this as Oscar bait. It's so phoned in, devoid of real-life consequence, and overall just a bad attempt at a Coen Brother's flick sprinkled with few and far between moments that are truly unique McDonagh. Very disappointed. And I REALLY wanted to enjoy this movie.

  - Because the movie is full of flawed people, and racism is one fairly common flaw for people to have.
  - To give the awesome speech in the restaurant, to provide a little comic relief, and (like all other characters) to further both the theme and the plot of the movie
  - He was one of the people Mildred was (rightfully or not) angry with.
  - She had a pretty good self-defense argument, plus the police are mostly incompetent, and the station burned down.
  - It was part of the pressure being put on Mildred. The point is not in the black friend, the story is about Mildred. All the story needs you to know at the time is that Mildred is being pressured.
  - Willoughby's proximity to death makes him the catalyst for the changes in the second part of the movie.

The things shown, and the consequences were wildly mismatched, so much that I guess the film was a farce?  The dad assaults the mom and the sun puts a knife to his throat, but it is played for a joke? The cop throws a guy out the window then violently beats him in front of the town, but isn't put in jail? Treating domestic abuse and bigots as jokes, without consequence doesn't make any sense to me. I liked Hell or Highwater WAY more. I feel like that is what this film was promising to be.

Rather than a highly convenient ending, we got subtly surprising tone shifts for the main two characters, a much needed grounding for Rockwell and a strange lift for McDormand.

She talks about the Bloods and the Crips, and she extends that same culpability to the priest. Does she in her own sense of justice perceive this man to be guilty? 

Will she continue her endless cycle of anger, towards her own inevitable destruction? If she decides to kill that man where does it stop. Anger begets more anger. If she chooses to kill that man she chooses this cycle.

She gets nothing coming for her because no one other than Dixon and the midget knew about it. And yeah, she was frustrated. I don't think she should have burnt the police station but she is misguided and filled with anger in that scene. I think she was meant to make a stupid decision like that.

dren1no,"I can't fault the logistics criticism that you brought up. However, I enjoyed the movie despite those. 
 I was underwhelmed by the movie until half way through; I kept thinking it was all over the place and was shoehorning too many things/characters. Then I realized this movie isn't about what initially seemed to be the main plot. The plot was only there as a vehicle to introduce us to these personalities and their relationships.

  The first 15-20 minutes seems like we're supposed to side with a grieving woman against ""ignorant, nasty cops"". But that gets completely turned around and everyone becomes real. There's no actual protagonist. Mildred didn't pay for the crap she pulled but the point is that we were not asked to justify her actions or root for her. It was more or less established that she was misguided in her anger at the police, they really had done all they could. It was her understandable grief and raging anger that was the enemy, not the cops or the ex-husband. 
I don't think the ending ignores the message. I also don't think it was left open as some here have suggested. [Mildred and Jason will not kill the guy in Ohio. That was implied by the way they both said ""not sure"" and suggested they would just ""decide along the way"". It's suggested that they never really intended to kill him, but just set off on the trip as a coping mechanism with the latest bad news which had left them helpless and hopeless once again. They basically went on a road trip as part of their new and unlikely friendship. That was my take. ](#spoiler)",7gs4g9

dss6ccx,"Dixon and Mildred found a sort of redemption in each other. Dixon was letting his personal situation affect how he handled his actions as an officer, which got him kicked off the force. If he had received that letter one day beforehand, he might still be on it. I think he got a sense of *validation* and appreciation from Willoughby's letter that he never got from anyone else, or from Willoughby when he was alive. His entire character seems to be someone who's insecure about his place in life and trying to use his position to assert authority because he doesn't get the respect he craves. He sees the consequences of his wrong actions when Red is being kind to him even after realizing who he was. He took a hell of a beating because there was a chance that the DNA could implicate this guy. The old Dixon probably would have confronted him and made a mess of the situation trying to arrest them both single-handedly.

Given everything Willoughby discussed with Mildred, it's clear that this isn't the case of bungling local cops screwing up a murder. They've done everything legally within their power to find the culprit, and they've turned up no leads. Her real subconscious motivation seems to be to shame the police to assuage her own guilt about the last thing she ever said to her daughter. She's trying to deflect that pain and make the entire community feel it. Two actions that make her come to this realization. The first is when she sees Dixon crawling out of the burning police station with her daughter's file, trying to keep it safe. The second is when she realizes that it was her ex that torched the billboards, not the police. She stopped seeing the police as the enemy, and seemed to gain the realization that she had superhuman expectations of them. Willoughby's suicide may also play a small part in that but I didn't get that from the movie.

Dixon and Mildred seemed to have a bonding moment over the hope that the killer had been caught. Both had gone through personal journeys that left them irrevocably transformed. Dixon's facial injuries reflected the emotional ones that Mildred was struggling with. I think Dixon was so distraught that he was planning on killing himself after telling Mildred the news. Instead, the idea came up to pay that guy in Idaho a visit. Both could satisfy the urges that they've been dealing with thus far.

More important, the fact that he ISN'T the murderer is actually necessary for what the film is trying to say about the characters. Throughout the film Francis McDormand lashes out at the wrong people for her daughter's death (most notably the sheriff, causing the entire town to hate her). 

The ending shows her once again trying to exact revenge on someone who had nothing to do with it, but then she seems to have a change of heart and (maybe) let it go. Same with Sam Rockwell deciding maybe extreme violence isn't the answer for once. 

In my opinion that was the whole point of the film, and it wouldn't have worked nearly as well (if at all) if the guy *was* the murderer. It would just add too many other questions and greatly over-complicate the story (why did the DNA not match? A mistake at the lab? A cover-up? Is the military involved?

dvfmpbb,"> The deer scene. Jesus fucking christ, what was going on with that? Not even Frances McDormand's damn near perfect acting chops could save it.

McDormand misses her daughter and saw a deer. It's pretty simple. There's a saying ""There are no atheists in foxholes."" McDormand is clearly pretty anti-religion, she's going through a crisis, and she just wants her daughter back. Not to catch the killer necessarily despite what she and the billboards say. It's evident that she wants her daughter back and at the end of the movie, accepts the fact that that will never happen. She sees a pretty animal walk up to her, and talks to it. You never talk to a dog? A cat? Any animal? [This video went viral recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc825fekWVY) because it's adorable that Queen Elizabeth reacted to cows the same way everyone does. How is it so outlandish to imagine saying ""That's an animal, hi animal!""? Especially when going through such a crisis as losing a child?

> The I hope you get raped flashback scene. Cheesy, too coincidential to be mildly emotional and extremely superficial. Barely tells anything about the teen girl who got killed.

It's not really supposed to show anything about the daughter, just another thing that Frances McDormand regrets in a long list of regrets for this situation. Her ex husband is angry and blames her for their daughter's death, her own son is angry at her about the billboards and kicking his classmates in their crotches, and everyone is angry with her and against the billboards, especially after Woody Harrelson's death. This scene showed that in a way, even she is angry with herself. She's not the determined, stoic, heroic protagonist who wants to bring justice to her daughter's killer that we've seen a million times. She has flaws and is upset with herself for them as well.

> Peter Dinklage's character is only here so he can be called a midget. I felt bad for him, as he's clearly an excellent actor who rarely gets an interesting character.

You are aware that Dinklage is quite clearly at the point in his career where he can be offered a script and make his own choice to accept or reject the role, right? His most famous role has him being called an ""imp"" half the time. But besides that, his character in Three Billboards was an incredibly strong and self-respecting person. He wanted a date with McDormand, got the date, saw that he wasn't respected by her, paid and left without any more to do with her. We don't know how well they knew each other beforehand. He's just some guy who lives in the town who happens to have dwarfism. People with dwarfism can live and work in small towns, go to the bars, have crushes on another townsperson, everything they showed Dinklage's character as. It's perfectly normal. The hard truth is that they will be made fun of for their physical appearance. Yet Dinklage's character stayed strong and turned away from a woman he was pursuing once he saw that she clearly didn't respect him either. Which, again, we're not sure if he directly experienced from her before the events of this movie. What's the problem?

> Woody Harrelson kills himself in a move that never had any set up

They mentioned him having cancer in nearly every scene he was in. They showed him getting furious and throwing a syringe with his blood in the doctor's office. He was talking about how perfect of a day it was -taking his kids out of school and going to the lake with them and his wife- before he put them to bed and then went out to tend to the horses. It showed that the idea of having cancer was consuming him and he was getting frustrated with it and didn't want to put himself or his family through the pain. There was plenty of set up to his suicide, not that I was expecting it. But thinking back, there were plenty of clues and it all made sense. I'm sorry you missed it all.

> Now, in less than five minutes, which is the duration of the scene when he reads the aforementioned letter, his character has an epifany followed by a 180º turn

Have you ever been burned alive? Or had any kind of near-death experience? I'm lucky that I haven't, but I also don't think it's far fetched for someone to have a near death experience, then strive to be a better person afterwards. Or if you want less drastic measures, I don't think it's far fetched for someone to read an impactful letter from a mentor they looked up to, possibly even a father figure as they didn't show or mention Rockwell's character's father that I can remember, and strive to be a better person in that mentor's honor after he or she passes away. Rockwell's first act of kindness was to save the Hayes file. Saying ""sorry"" to Caleb Landry Jones the next day was just a continuation of the decision he made, possibly as he was reading Woody Harrelson's letter the night prior, to be better.

But that said, there was no reason to sympathize with him. I didn't. I just figured he was a drunk and racist and homophobic asshole in the beginning, then he was trying to not be drunk or racist or homophobic asshole after reading a letter from a recently deceased person close to him, and a near death experience.

> Oh, I forgot to mention Frances McDormand's boss. She's one of the few black characters in the movie and is apparently only there to help our protagonist.

Between this point and the point about the flashback with the daughter, it seems like you want a two hour movie to flesh out the depth and nuance of each minor character. It goes without saying that that's impossible. McDormand's boss is her friend who supports her cause. That's all we need to know about her while telling McDormand's character's story. Maybe later they'll make a two hour movie about the boss with McDormand as a supporting character. But she did what she had to in this movie. The fact that she's black couldn't matter less, except with her arrest continuing to show race issues in the United States.

> But, I know, you are now probably thinking she's a one dimensional character, righ? No, she isn't! Let's set her up with another black character, because that's what a real character development looks like. RIGHT? RIGHT?

They looked at each other and smiled. Calm down.

I'm not saying you have to like the movie, that's subjective. I know what that's like, I had huge problems with films like The Shape of Water or Manchester By the Sea that clearly a lot of other people did enjoy. But I think a lot of your specific complaints are a little off base and can easily be explained.",7gs4g9
dv87vl8,"1.The deer reminded Mildred of her Daughter. And it was very obvious and I don't know what's your problem with that. 

2.Agree with the part that we can't see any background story of the daughter. But that scene is to show the relationship between Mildred and her daughter. I would have preferred them not to show the daughter at all. Rape dialogue is kinda cheesy af. 

3. Also agree with Peter Dinklage character. He was just there to save Mildred because she burned the police station. His character kinda is forced. 

4. And nah Dixon didn't turn himself into a saint after reading the fucking letter for five minutes. Dixon got himself in a fire accident and he is reading his chief's and his friends letter who he loves dearly and he is in a fire accident and next thing he see after reading that letter about him changing into a good cop is his case. So he took it outside. And the real redemption he got is partly from the fire and from the kind treatment of Red Welby. And also I don't have to tell you the time frame that he must've spent a hell lot of time in the hospital ever since he was admitted because of his fire wounds. And it was enough time to realise his mistakes. I mean they won't shove everything down on your face like when is he brushing, when is he peeing. And for all the mess he did, he got fired and also Welby is not pressing any charges for beating the shit outta him. And noone forgets or forgives His character. Especially when the black couple was on the bar. She was clearly annoyed by his presence. And they kinda sympathize when he was beaten and helps him. And agree with the part that it screams that he is a good guy. But at the end, he atleast try to be,.

The timing of it seemed like it was a few weeks apart from the bar scene, so it seems weird that he'd just be passing through again. And if he was just passing through, why would he have known about her daughter and how would he have the knowledge of where she worked? And even if he was staying in Ebbing for awhile, it still seems odd that he never would've come up as a suspect. Despite his clean reclrd, if he was openly talking about something like that in a bar, that probably wouldn't have been the first time it had been mentioned. It just seemed weird that McDonagh did all that work to convince us it was him and to quickly take it back.

The identity of the killer is not the point of the film, but my guess is that he knows the real killer (perhaps someone else in his branch of the military who he met while overseas) and was passing the story off as his own to “impress” his buddy. We see this in real life (especially in rural areas, and more so with crimes committed before the era of social media) all the time. Some crime gets committed and goes unsolved for years and you may have multiple people taking credit for it because they think it makes them seem tough or fearsome, or they are just ensnared with the idea that people think they could be a killer.

For the first two acts of the film he's an absolutely reprehensible piece of shit asshole and part of me wondered if we were supposed to forget all of that purely because he started trying to help Mildred. I think that would be really flimsy writing, and I don't think it's what McDonagh intended at all.


Dixon strikes me as the kind of guy who's so clueless that he actually believes he's always right, even if it's glaringly obvious to everybody else that he's a total fuck up. When he tortured the black suspect and when he threw Red out the window, he thought he was morally justified in doing that terrible shit.


Cut to the third act and now he decides to help Mildred in her crusade. They literally makes plans to go and murder a guy because Dixon convinces Mildred that he's *probably* guilty of an unrelated crime. Dixon hasn't really changed at all - he's still following the same path of self-righteous violence, but now it's presented as being more acceptable because he's targeting someone who ""deserves it.""


I think this serves to highlight how potentially anybody can turn out like Dixon. For the whole movie Mildred is painted as a woman whose moral compass is on point but when anger has a strong enough influence on a person it can lead them to believe that they're morally justified in doing horrible things to a person who might not necessarily deserve it.


The movie doesn't ram this message down your throat, but there are so many references to anger in the script that it can't be accidental.",7gs4g9

2) I honestly didn’t look too much into the “if he did it” or not thing, although i’m going with it was him but maybe too high up to reach and that he came in that day because he felt the billboards were stirring up too much commotion/contributing to the police looking into the case again. IIRC, willoughby in his letter states that the DNA tests they cross reference for suspects are against those already in the system, and at the end, the new chief mentions this guy has no priors (or am I misremembering).

dqpuk80,"For what it's worth, I only half agree with 1 of your points:
 
&nbsp;

The dentist-drill scene is a bit over the top, but I excused it because EVERYTHING she does to her ""enemies"" is completely rage-fuelled and outrageous. It's part of her character development, (as is the scene with the priest or the drink-hurling high-schoolers, etc), to show her hitting back 10 times as hard when she perceives the world has punched her.

&nbsp;

I thought the deer-chat and talking slippers scenes were true to life; have you never played devil's advocate to yourself, or just played your own companion in a conversation about your thoughts? If you haven't, I can see why you'd think this artificial, but I have, and it didn't bother me in the slightest. I thought these moments just served to show a different, softer side to the character.

&nbsp;

I have met cops that racist. Rural Missouri is as good a place to find them as any, in my experience. Rural anywhere in middle America really. There are definitely non-racist cops as well, but a cop calling someone a ""beaner"" in the small Wisconsin town in which I currently live wouldn't ruffle as many feathers as you might think.

[Pancreatic cancer is very difficult to treat because it often goes undiagnosed until late stages](http://pancreatic.org/pancreatic-cancer/about-the-pancreas/prognosis/). Coughing up blood is not a sign of early stage pancreatic cancer. As a healthcare provider, the sheriff's decision makes 100% sense to me, although I would have gone about it differently, so as to prevent my family from having the trauma of finding my body. Otherwise, his decision was totally reasonable.

The beautiful thing about this message is that it is not taken in the context of forgiving others, I think the importance here is being willing to forgive yourself. At some point in this movie a lot of characters are looking for some sort of refuge for the pain they've caused others, and it elaborates on the journeys they each take in order to reach it. 

I also thought it had something to say about the power of being willing to forgive life for never necessarily giving you the answer you're looking for.

Dixon thinks that beating the shit out of Red is right, when it's just plain assault.

They all are facing things that they can't quite face, and have no way of handling it other than lashing out. It's about futile rage and how it can engulf us, how it can make us do terrible things while being convinced that we're still in the ""right"".

The general trend is a character does something in anger, and the next character has a choice to continue with anger and snowball the process, or act with love. But there’s always something definitive that happened, even if the response is directed at the wrong person (such as Mildred thinking Dixon/police setting the billboards on fire and responding in kind). 

Based on this, it leads me to believe the rapist was actually a rapist, but not Angela’s. I’m not even sure any other character in the movie lied, so there’s no reason for me to believe a random character comes in spouting bullshit. The characters tend to be brutally honest with their words. Which is why I think the gift shop scene detracts from the film, because it’s so out of line with the rest of the movie.

The gift shop scene, Another guys explanation kind of fit that I'd rather believe is that the military was covering his involvement up and he hates that Mildred is bringing it up again,  which I like rather than some rando likes bragging about raping and setting girls on fire but totally isn't the killer.

If we pretend the gift shop scene doesn't exist, then it's just a guy who happenstance ends up in Ebbing with a similar story that is coincidental - thus the twist. No need for the disrespected badass freak explanation, or power play explanation, or whatever. He's a rapist with a plausible backstory of soldier doing morbid things in Afghanistan.

Quench the fires of his tribulations by being put in the same room as the guy he tortured, and he'll make some dramatic improvements.

If any part of that is poorly thought out, it's that Willoughby waited so long to tell him.

hw1u91j,"Sorry for the 4-year late reply; I've just now seen the film.

His arc is a little more developed -- He loses his job, experiences the disappointment of his mother, learns of the burning of the billboards (deflates his anger), reads a highly emotional suicide note just prior to the moment in which he's presented his first ""hero"" decision (save the file), is able to make good on saving the file despite being burn (catharsis of whatever ""torture"" reputation he has), is treated kindly by the person he attacked while in the hospital, then hears the confessions of a true monster -- prompting his second ""hero"" moment.

His life was in ruins, and here was his dead friend and mentor's letter telling him he believed in him, that he had the makings of being a good detective. All he wanted was someone to show him love and that can be life changing. Especially when the case that caused all this chaos is sitting right in front of him - the one thing that can redeem him and honour his dead friends legacy. He says ""I'm a cop"" because for the first time he suddenly realised ""I can be a good person"" and he does the impossible, saves the file while enduring agonizing pain. He's suddenly on a mission now to do the right thing because deep down he always wanted to do what's right - just anger blinded him, fueled his darker instincts.

dqmqk1z,"I see where you're coming from, but still stand by my points. I definitely agree with your assessment of Chekov's Gun in McDonagh's work, it's a device he uses expertly. And I think he uses it well here too, just one example being Willoughby's letter and the bar.

I believe lot of what makes *Three Billboards* his best film stems from the premise that it is so much more grounded than either *In Bruges* or *Seven Psychopaths*. I personally thought that while *Seven Psychopaths* was very pithy, overall it's a mediocre film, and it feels very ""movie-like"". *In Bruges* is obviously amazing, but is also very much a movie that hinges on a world of violence -- these men live and breathe death.

*Three Billboards* has a completely different mindset -- it's much more desperate, much less ""absurd"". This is a small town wracked by tragedy --
 violence is not supposed to be in this town's lifeblood (outside of Dixon), and the fact that it is now throws everything off-balance. And a lot of that tone plays into the dialogue. There aren't as many quips or punchy back-and-forth scenes because they don't really fit into the atmosphere of the movie. The ones we do get, I think, play really well into the characters' personalities.

Dinklage's character definitely serves a purpose, I'm not sure how he doesn't? He may not have anything directly to do with Angela's murder or the search for her killer, but he's a person who lives in the town; he's friends with Red and likes Mildred -- that's enough to establish him. He helps her put the billboards back up after they're burnt, saves Dixon from burning to death, and covers for Mildred's actions. And, arguably, he's the most decent person involved in this whole debacle. He knows he's the butt of the joke but uses that to teach Mildred a lesson about kindness.

On the other hand, I DO agree with you that Robbie could have been used better. Lucas Hedges I think has a lot of talent as a young actor but I do think he was a bit miscast in this role.

*In Bruges* has much more quotable and memorable dialogue, for sure, but *Three Billboards'* dialogue is just so much more visceral. At the center, this is still a film very much about a mother's grief and guilt, and no amount of witty dialogue will make that pain any less unbearable.",7gs4g9
dqlj214,"I disagree, I think the point was to seed the idea in the audience’s heads so that later when Dixon is at the bar, the audience is already having ideas about how that’s going to play out. It’s so, so hard and so rewarding when a writer can let the audience believe they not only know what’s going on, but that they’re also *ahead* of the story, only to take a hard turn the other direction.

McDonagh *wants* you thinking that we’re going to actually see the incredibly unlikely, totally-Hollywood moment of Dixon finding the guy, being smart enough to get evidence, and give Mildred the peace we all want her to have. And then he completely pulls the rug out from under that, not for the sake of a twist, but as a device to show us what the movie is about. The world he’s created is bleak, mean, and hurting, but the characters within it have the chance to be a little better, even if only slightly so. So rather than hand his characters an ending, a convenient resolution, he forces them to make a choice, and then leaves us to decide what it is.",7gs4g9
dqqhjy9,"For the most part I really like McDonagh's dialogue, but holy shit, every line about Willoughby's cock/the couple's sex life was horrible. I kept looking for any reasoning the film had to keep those lines in there, but there really wasn't any.

He did just about everything in his power to solve the case. But Mildred wants him to go farther and do something that's literally impossible (DNA test every man in town).

This seems to be a setup: though we were lead to believe Mildred is on a righteous crusade, the truth is that the crusade is entirely unfounded and Mildred is now mentally unwell.

One would expect this to be the throughline in the movie - people trying to help Mildred, make her understand what really happened and that she has to move on. Instead, it's as if the movie forgets that this thread was introduced and we continue to follow Mildred as if her billboards will accomplish anything.

Thus, whenever we see Mildred do something that's intended to make us cheer - like accuse the pastor of being a pedophile, or burning down the ""corrupt"" police station - we're actually witnessing the meltdown of a mother who's been mentally warped by her own grief.

dv2mda7,"""I found it problematic that I was being asked to sympathize with Jason Dixon. Dude was the embodiment of awful cops.

He wants to be a detective and do good things! Look, he was burned then beat up, now doesn't that mean we can like him now?"" ""

Ugh that author completely misses the point of that though. Understanding root causes of behaviors doesn't mean you have to like the person, they're still bad, there's just reason behind the bad instead of just ""evil"". People can change and reflect, murderers in prison have turned into better people through reading, self reflection, therapy, education, and gone on to educate, inform, change lives to help keep people from going down their path, same with reformed gang/hate group members.

Dixon represented so much of what is wrong with people, fear, stupidity, ignorance and blind trust/loyalty in their elders and authority. He lashed out violently in retribution for someone older and more powerful than him, even though the chief never would have wanted him to. Hes a perfect representation of cops today and throughout our history, violent reactionary racists. The movie doesn't say forget all that. 

I couldn't imagine that complaint about American History X, could you? Same in s lot of ways, scumbag violent fearful racist works to change himself and do better, has causes explained that lead to how he became who he was, but he's still the bad things he was, they don't get whitewashed, he just tries to do better.

When Willoughby dies it means exacting revenge on someone who Dixon assumes is partially responsible for his death. But then when Willoughby tells Dixon to be a better person and forget the billboards, it means that Dixon is willing to do that as well.

Even though it’s only a few scenes that’s a lot emotionally for a character to go through and makes his arc totally believable, especially if you believe Willoughbys note that Dixon did actually mean well, and wasn’t as black and white as he’s made out to be early on in the movie.

I'm not sure this first part is actually true. Although I generally agree with the rest.

I just saw the movie and interestingly there's no actual ""in-movie"" connection made between the creepy man who tries to scare Mildred at the gift shop and the guy at the bar that Dixon thinks is the rapist/murderer, which goes against your point.

We the audience know that they're the same guy but Mildred and Dixon don't actually know that.

As the movie was ending I was thinking to myself about how surprised Mildred would be when she discovers that the creepy guy who tried to scare her at the gift shop is actually the same guy that Dixon overheard bragging about raping and killing a girl while serving overseas. Because this isn't something that is revealed to her in the movie.",7gs4g9
du54fea,"[spoiler text here]

Two things the veteran says to his friend in the bar scene:
""I was certifiably fucking insane for a while back there.""
""I ain’t going down for that shit, last fucking day down there.""
So he's really saying that he raped a woman out of the country, during a war.

He also tells his friend it happened ""bout nine, ten months ago."" So, if the guy's memory is to be trusted, he went back to the United States 9 or 10 months before the bar scene.

We can try to check if what Abercrombie says about him being in the war the day Angela was raped and murdered is true. To do that, a general timeline of the events depicted in the movie is needed:
- The billboards go up on Easter Sunday.
- Mildred's first TV interview happens ""seven months"" after the crime, as she says to the reporter.
- After Willoughby's death, the TV reporter is back and says: ""Could it [his suicide] have something to do with a story we ran here just two weeks ago, of these billboards…"" So it's still been 7 months after the crime – or 8 at the most because we don't know for sure if when Mildred said ""seven months"" she meant 7 months sharp; it could be 7 month and 2 or 3 weeks.
- The billboards on fire are set on fire that same day. Mildred sets the police station on fire the next day. This is explicitly established through references to time in dialogue.
- In the aftermath of the police station fire, after James covers up for Mildred, he asks her: ""So you wanna go out to dinner next week?""
- Their dinner happens the same night the veteran's bragging/confessing scene in the bar. During the dinner, Mildred says to James: ""A deal is a deal."" So, within the movie, there is no element to believe that the dinner took longer than one week to happen, like they had arranged.
Which means that the alibi presented by Abercrombie in the veteran's favor is FALSE. From our analysis above we know that it's been still ""less than 8 months"" plus ""two weeks"" plus two days plus ""one week"" after the crime. This necessarily means less than 9 months since the crime.

Recapping – in the bar scene, the veteran tells his friend that his last day in the war was 9, 10 months ago. So he was most likely in the United States the day of the crime.

Why would Abercrombie pass a wrong information? It's most likely a cover up. Here are a few other elements supporting this reading:

- As someone pointed out in this thread, cover ups are a recurring action in this movie.
- The sentence ""anger just begets greater anger"" is consistent with the veteran being involved in the Ebbings crime. He probably did it once in the war and did it again when he went back to the United States. (Alternatively, he might have done it in Ebbings and is transferring that memory to another place and time where he thinks he can use the context of war as an excuse to in his morality code condone what he did. Other alternative theories could be thought of, but the conclusion that he was behind the crime in Ebbings would remain all the same.)
- His description of how he did it overseas is consistent with the crime in Ebbings, adding to the hypothesis that he was behind the two crimes.
- The fact that he keeps coming back to Ebbings (and sits right behind the one booth that is taken in the bar – he couldn't see Dixon't had above the booth, but its shade is visible through the glass that separates the booths) might point to his unconscious guilt and unconscious desire to be punished – interestingly, guilty is also an underlying motivation for Mildred.

Of course I'm judging the man based in dramatic conventions. This isn't a court of justice. The point here isn't if we would have enough legal elements to say whether he's guilty or not, but if there are enough narrative elements to find an answer. In my opinion, the movie gives us just enough to think so.

1. In the letter to Mildred, the Sheriff said sometimes some cases we just can't find the criminals until several years later they would boast around about the crime...I mean if that guy is not the rapist, why bother the director presenting something like that in the movie?

2. It is too creepy for him to visit the store. You know what I recalled when seeing that scene? Last year a Chinese female scholar got murdered in UIUC by an American PhD. And as the police proved that the murderer went to her memorial get-together several days after. And psychologists said that some criminals turn to visit places related to their crimes.

THERE is where he committed the rape of someone who is not Angela, in the country that was being targeted (Middle East). Ya know how during war sometimes humans will rape the women of those they have conquered? Guy was a sexual sadist or something. He had an alibi. The DNA didn't match.

The movie does a dreadful job juggling it two tones (comedy and drama). For example, a scene starts with Mildred and her son flinging cereal at each other, then the son is excited when he hears his dad, instantly his dad is an asshole who strangles Mildred and the son brings a knife to his throat, then we have a goofy girlfriend character interrupt to give some stuttered line.

The problem lies in how this sequence is shot. If the strangling was shot stylistically in line with the abrupt shift to awkward comedy, it'd work. The problem is, there is no stylistic thought put into the camerawork and compositions of this film, it's shot no different than a standard tv drama. Therefore, when we see sudden violence, it just feels real, and to undercut real violence with comedy doesn't work as well as playing up campy violence with a punch line. Little things like this point to what the other user took problem with and that's a movie not knowing how to handle its tone.

Also, why was the son excited to see his dad? It was established prior that he's abusive and we never see a side to him that would make the son excited to see him.

And he stands up for himself, using the word *dwarf* instead of the slur and maybe forcing Mildred to take a good look at herself. That might be why she reacted to her husband without the expected violence. IMO Dinklage's character ends up as one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie, except for maybe the son.

I think that he did some redeeming things but he’s still a shitty person. I don’t think McDonagh meant for that either. No one in this movie is really all that great of a person, or a “good guy” per say. I mean even Woody Harrelson makes you hate him a little for doing that to his wife and kids. McDormand certainly isn’t either.

drfob3m,"I think the CO is covering for him or the new Police Chief is, or both.

I think the guy was definitely the rapist. I mean in the bar he even talked about using gasoline. If like Dixon said at the end, ""He isn't the rapist, but I know he raped somebody,"" and he wasn't just making up a haunting rape memory for no reason with his buddy in the bar, then it is even crazier that the ""other"" girl that was raped was also covered in gasoline. Around the same time too if we are to believe he was in Iraq at the time and presumably the rape he was referring to in the bar happened there.

It'd be one of the many (almost too many) subversion of expectations. You see Dixon fired by this new black Police Chief who is there obviously as a foil to his racist torturing or whatever. I was under the impression most of the movie that Woody Harrelson's character was covering for Dixon in some way. I really, really thought it was going to be Dixon who did the rape. I thought the last third of the movie was going to be the new Police Chief uncovering the evidence against Dixon.

I think you are supposed to think everything is Dixon [billboards on fire anyone?](#spoiler) so that when he has a heroic turn he is met with the same bureaucratic cover-ups by the boys on the inside that the police force used on his torturing of black suspects. I mean Woody Harrelson is completely unapologetic about what Dixon did and that he is still on the force. ""If you fired every cop in the country that hated black people you'd have three guys left. And they would all hate the fags."" Dixon is now on the outside looking in when he legitimately does good police work.      ",7gs4g9

Why did the character from the bar also show up at Mildred's workplace?

I am just a curious commenter, I don't have the answers to the film but I think it generates an interesting discussion.

Me personally, I think one of the major themes of the film is the failing of institutions put through the lens of Mildred's experience. 

The PD failed her and her daughter, the institution of the community fails her by not supporting her and instead deferring to the PD, the conversation with the priest references the massive failings of religious institutions to protect their followers, and (this cannot be proven but I feel it is implied) the military, as an institution, COULD be failing justice by protecting a soldier who committed a crime but will not hold him accountable - this, I feel, is a reference to prior occurrences of military silence in the face of sexual assault.",7gs4g9

Yes, the moment was outside of the norm within the movie but compare that to the countless times the movie intentionally broke the genre to facilitate a scene and it was pretty clear on their intention to do so. I could make a list of scenes that felt entirely out of place with the rest of the movie in their tone, execution, script, humor/lack of humor.  You could call that a bad script if you want a predictable movie but I enjoyed how it kept me on my toes. There are PLENTY of quality movies that flip the script without needing to be constrained by what scenes have come before or what genre it is supposed to be. The humor in the movie in such dire and serious subject-matter should be a clear indicator that they don't want to be confined by what is acceptable. 

As a viewer the scene was clearly meant as a reflection of her psyche and show you where her motivations and her grief has led her. It's no different than a monologue in a play where the lead gets to show the viewer who they are without having to filter that through the framework of a conversation about something else. Just because you aren't used to that or find it odd doesn't mean it's wrong. It's uncommon in movies, but it's not bad. ",7gs4g9

I think, thematically, Dixon's character is what drives this story. The director utilizes Dixon's character to portray the current state of the police force. And furthermore, the script is pinpointed on Dixon for a clear character arc, it's obvious for the majority of the movie that the audience will not be gifted the answer of who the rapist/murderer of the daughter was. And that's not what the movie is about. I also don't think that Dixon is meant to be sympathetic. Just because he has frequent screen time, doesn't mean his is meant to be sympathized with. It's ultimately about McDormand's character. She is redeemed by finding a clear(ish) head within Dixon's character. She doesn't see everything that the audience sees in terms of Dixon's past. This is what makes the script brilliant, it has so many distinct characters that when we think a decision should or shouldn't be made by a character that we do or don't care about, it's the reasoning behind the actions that drive a compelling narrative.

At the end, after Dixon and Mildred have made choice after choice based on their convictions and understanding exactly why they do what they've done, they face a situation that leaves them both uncertain. They've lost that conviction and are faced with a choice. If the movie had kept going and Mildred recognized the guy it could have fallen into a whodunit situation but we're left with that choice.It doesn't matter what the guy is, what matters is the active acknowledgement from both Dixon and Mildred that they now face a choice in which they are willing to say they don't know.

Every murder story has multiple people come out of the woodwork to say they did it even when they were 5 states over and in jail at the time of the killing.   Its par for the course in investigating a murder;  crazies want to be a part of the story, even if they have nothing to do with it. 

More than likely he didnt do anything to anyone (the only reason I say he may be a rapist is because that personality type usually is;  but more like domestic abuse rape, not attacking a random girl and killing her rape) .  

That sort of false confession happens pretty often with sensationalized  murders.  And it isnt uncommon that they are made to friends as a way of boasting like in the bar scene (a couple  of the guys who *confessed* to being the Zodiac did it that way; they were all later proven to have not done it, they all just had a sick sense of humor) .

Who says that a sheriff couldn't meet and fall in love with a younger girl from another country? The scenes that we see him share with his family are full of genuine tenderness and love.

dqls4n6,"> McDonagh *wants* you thinking that we’re going to actually see the incredibly unlikely, totally-Hollywood moment of Dixon finding the guy, being smart enough to get evidence, and give Mildred the peace we all want her to have. And then he completely pulls the rug out from under that, not for the sake of a twist, but as a device to show us what the movie is about. The world he’s created is bleak, mean, and hurting, but the characters within it have the chance to be a little better, even if only slightly so. So rather than hand his characters an ending, a convenient resolution, he forces them to make a choice, and then leaves us to decide what it is.

A bit like Haneke’s “Funny Games” in this regard. Audiences tend to feel they are owed resolution, in a very specific and traditional form, in movies like these. Although “Three Billboards” doesn’t break the fourth wall, McDonagh planted a seed in our minds with the “in five years...” thing. And then, we think we’re seeing that play out in the bar scene and we get our hopes up, only to get kicked in the balls one last time with the revelation that it couldn’t be him. Many viewers will be frustrated with the ending and their perceived lack of resolution (or at least the resolution they wanted) but real life is messy and complicated and frustrating. 

PS: Speaking of real life being messy and frustrating, it is more than a little ironic that this movie goes into wide release the day after Kate Steinle’s killer was acquitted.

dv31cib,"Yo! I am the author haha. 

I appreciate that stance. And agree with it. Root causes of behavior doesn't mean we like the person. And very very very very very few people, if any, are just evil for no reason. There's always factors like the ones you pointed out: fear, stupidity, blind trust. 

I'm not arguing that someone like Dixon is beyond redemption so any movement towards redemption is disingenuous. It's that the film had, at times, a tone that made Dixon seem more of a lovable idiot than a cruel and racist authority figure who abused his power. I think that's purposeful, but my initial, visceral reaction to it was a negative one. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate what the movie did with it. 

I can't tell from your American History X paragraph if you didn't read any further in the article or did and are asking rhetorically? My very next paragraphs were about American History X. 

> Compare Dixon's portrayal to Danny Vinyard of American History X. Vinyard is a grade-A racist, neo-Nazi asshole who eventually goes to jail for murdering a black man. While in prison, he's raped by other neo-Nazi assholes. Over a period of time, we watch Vinyard become friends with Lamont, a black inmate. By the time Vinyard leaves prisons, he's no longer the guy he was. We then follow him as he goes back to his old life and tries to make amends and save his brother, who's gone down a similar path. 
 
> Where Three Billboards has various people defending Dixon and at times seemingly tries to make Dixon endearing, American History X avoids any of that with Vinyard. No one defends him. No one pities him. His actions are his actions and the movie frames him as a monster. Then observes as that monster searches for and discovers humanity.  
 
> Initially, that's what I wish Three Billboards would have done. And would have been my major criticism of Three Billboards. But that criticism didn't last long. That's because, in looking to explain the ending of Three Billboards, I discovered that almost every character in the movie has a similar sympathetic/unsympathetic duality about them. 


You're right that there are macro similarities between Vinyard and Dixon. Same arcs. The major difference is just in the portrayal of the characters, the reactions to the character, the overall tone, and the time frames. Vinyard's transformation is the core of American History X, taking place over the course of years. Dixon goes from violent, cruel, ignorant, racist asshole, to a collected, emphatic try-hard in just a matter of days. I'm not saying that isn't possible. There are paradigm shifting events in life, and Dixon certainly was primed for a wake-up call. I'm just talking to the initial feeling of being unhappy with Dixon's portrayal and character arc. I like it now. But initially it was like, ""What are they doing??""",7gs4g9

Completely agree. He reads the letter and wants to be the person Willoughby wrote about, so he saves the case file, and months later, takes a beating to secure DNA from a potential suspect for the same reason.

It's interesting, because I completely disagreed with Willoughby's letter. Dixon is not a good man and not a good cop. He's racist, stupid, arrogant, and violent. Even without the window-throwing scene we pick up on this. I think the letter gave Dixon the idea that he was capable of being the hero cop with the heart of gold, and he fully believed it until the DNA came back as not a match. When he throws the badge on the new chief's desk, I saw that as him being brought back to reality and an understanding of who he is and what his potential (or lack thereof) actually is.

duubd6y,"I arrived at the same conclusion as you. [Just wrote a long analysis about it](https://www.filmcolossus.com/single-post/2018/02/25/Explaining-the-end-of-THREE-BILLBOARDS-OUTSIDE-EBBING-MISSOURI-the-theme-of-moral-ambiguity-how-endings-inform-the-story-and-whether-or-not-Mildred-kills-the-soldier). 

My main approach was to look at the fact that moral ambiguity is a major motif in the film. Every major character, and most of the minor characters, are developed in a way that shows they have moments of moral + and moral -. No one is really painted as just good or just bad. Which they could have easily done. 

This all builds to the narrative's conclusion, which leaves us with two morally ambiguous characters trying to decide if they will do this morally ambiguous thing to a morally ambiguous third party. 

Looking back at Abercrombie, he's seemingly the only character in the movie who is just a good person, with no moment that's really questionable. Though I guess someone could argue that Dixon should have been arrested rather than fired. But he still did something Willoughby wouldn't. He would, it seems, be a pretty big outlier in the movie if he were just a good guy. And kind of unnecessary. Dixon could have been fired over the phone by someone we don't see. The desk sergeant could have broken the news that the soldier wasn't a DNA match and was in Afghanistan. 

So why have Abercrombie? To have that dynamic where he's seemingly a good guy (fires Dixon) but is just as morally ambiguous as everyone else (covers for the soldier). 

I think his slip up with the time frame confirms it. ""He wasn't in the country when it happened [7 months ago]."" ""He got back 9 months ago"". ",7gs4g9
dunh2dz,"I haven't seen a better analysis of the move than this. So, kudos to you for that.

",7gs4g9

Top analysis. Was trawling for something like this.
Totally agree that Abercrombie was up to something. 
Haven't seen anyone suggest that he never even ran the DNA tests.

dv71l2t,"I think understanding this is hugely important in relation to the last scene. If he is that way they are essentially headed off to murder a damaged, but ultimately innocent man.

dv402ed,"Thanks for your thoughts (your English is great by the way!).

I agree with these points, but I do wonder why the police chief suggests that the DNA was not a match. Maybe the police chief lies about the DNA? 

You're right- it seems like a very strange coincidence that a man would brag about raping and burning a girl at a bar, and also track down the girl's mother and suggest to her that he is possibly the man responsible.

A few instances of excessive or unusual usage of ""ain't"" that I can't remember, exactly.

Willoughby forgives Mildred. Red, in probably the most obvious act of forgiveness, brings Dixon a glass of juice. Dixon forgives Mildred for setting him on fire. Jerome saves Dixon from an assault even though the latter tortured another black man. Mildred forgives her x at dinner.

Forgiveness marks the **END** of each characters arc. It may seem like these characters's stories are left unresolved, but I think that's intentional. Forgiveness isn't satisfactory. Forgiveness means giving up *satisfaction* in order to achieve piece and move on. This is reflected in the fact that each character disappears as forgiveness is achieved for them or from them.

ds5zpw3,"The theme of the film is that in the aftermath of a shocking tragedy, people are left reeling and that either anger or something else can fill the hole left in their heart.

The film is full of people expressing misplaced anger. There's no real evidence that the police failed Mildred on an investigative level... there are no leads, nothing left to investigate. They've failed in empathising with her and keeping in touch with her, sure... they've failed in some basic decency.

She's angry at them because she's lashing out in the absense of any real closure. Anger is an easy emotion to indulge, and she's convinced they could have done more. It's a stage of grief.

Just like Dixon lashes out in anger at Red, even though Red had nothing to do with anything.

The theme of the film is learning to move beyond anger, and that some basic decency can make a change in the world even if there are incredible evils we'll never overcome.

Dixon experiences that decency and then tries it out himself.

Mildred chooses not to lash out in anger at her ex-husband.

And that's why they will decide to turn that car around. 

That man from the bar may be a monster, or he may be a loudmouth wanting to show off. We don't know.

Him showing up at Mildred's workplace is a piece of misdirection from the film-maker, to introduce the man as either a possible suspect or just a piece of shit.

Either way, whether a monster or just a jerk, he's not the real target of their anger, or their loss. The film is conclusive on this. He's not the man.

One of the best things you can do with movies is let go of what you think a movie should be about and just watch it and experience it. Take it scene by scene and just absorb what's being shown to you. 

In a movie like bladerunner 2049, you're gonna be experiencing beautiful visuals and visceral sound. In a movie like this, you're gonna be getting be getting raw emotion and your morality challenged.

So what was the message? I will answer that question, but first I'll ask, does this movie or any movie actually need a message? Having a focal point for the entire movie does help make it memorable, but sometimes just the journey and experience itself can be enjoyable. I might be dumb but I can't recall what the message of reservoir dogs was? But that fact doesn't stop me from enjoying it.

Regardless, this movie resonated with me. I connected with Mildred and her pain, despite having no similar experiences. Early on, the movie shows us how kind she is, helping the beetle, or choosing to get help for Willoughby after he coughs blood in her face, even if she could have used that as leverage for her current situation.

However, as the movie progresses, the pain and guilt of what happened to her daughter eats away at her, till she starts becoming the one who is inflicting pain onto others in her quest for justice. Counter this with the hateful fuckwit Dixon, who is racist (even if he is unaware) and a bit of a dumb cunt.

The pivotal moment in the film comes when Willoughby clocks out in a moment of selflessness (or maybe selfishness), but chooses to send out kind and inspiring messages to those around him.

It's at the firebombing of the police station, where Dixon realises that he can change, and has it in himself to be a good person, and where Mildred learns that she is spreading pain amongst others.

The remainder of the film primarily focuses on characters trying to do the right thing, even if that means murdering that rapist cunt. I really liked the ending because the car ride had nothing to do with murdering the guy, they very might have well done it, but she was just content to know that he cared. It doesn't matter that they might never catch the real killer, closure for her was knowing that someone recognized her pain and wanted to help make things right.

**tl:dr**

In the end, the message to me was that hate spreads like a virus, where your acts of justice or vengeance only serve to spread more injustice and pain in this world. However, love and empathy are also infectious, and can make the lives of those around you better.

This is probably condescending and maybe I'll end up on moviescirclejerk. But I literally just watched the movie and it had a profound effect on me. Regardless of whether you read this or not, it helped order my thoughts writing this all out. I might wake up sober tomorrow and delete it.",7gs4g9

Abercrombie seemed to be covering something up for the guy's CO. Which would make sense since every character had immoral behaviors as well as redeeming. Up to that point in the film the new chief had only been shown to have virtuous behavior. 

It would make sense that he's covering up for either the Soldier (saving face for top brass above him), as this would make his character morally ambiguous like the rest of the characters. (whether that's because he committed the act or was complicit is inconsequential imho)

Abercrombie is way too celebratory of Dixon's ability to sniff out an alleged perp. And the final hint is Abercrombie 'letting slip' that soldier perp returned state side 9 months ago. At this point it's been about 8-1/2 months since the crime occurred, making it entirely plausible said perp was somehow involved.

**Mildred being interview by the TV journalist after renting the billboards:**

Reporter:

why did you put up these billboards?

Mildred: 
> Well, my daughter, Angela, she got
abducted, and she got raped and murdered
seven months ago",7gs4g9
dqn5t06,"I think this holds true with kind of the theme of the movie, too.

Hayes puts up billboards blaming Willoughby, but it was out of his control.

Willoughby kills himself and Dixon thinks it's because of Hayes so he attacks Welby, it had nothing to do with either of them.

Billboards burnt down and Hayes thinks it was Dixon so she lights up the police station, it was her ex-husband.

Dixon overhears this guy in the bar so he and Hayes go after him, but he didn't actually do anything.

------

I might be missing some, but it seems to me that a lot of what happened had to do with people reacting without all of the information. I think the guy lying about it and facing repercussions would fit with the rest of the film.

I assume they would have to build some sort of case and couldn't just make an arrest based on a former cop overhearing someone at a bar and randomly sending in DNA he collected himself. 

I could see a scenario where Mildred and Dixon decide to kill the soldier (especially since they realize upon arriving he was the one at the store) and right as they commit the murder the police show up to arrest him for the murder of Angela Hayes. ",7gs4g9

Yeah I totally agree with your point of ""consistent theme of moral ambiguity"".

Similarly, Mildred forgives nothing; she just sets aside her rage insofar as doing so facilitates her getting what she wants. Throughout the film, they both rush to judgement, exacting swift, senseless revenge at the slightest provocation and armed with the filmsiest of ""evidence"".

Further, if you look at other cast members, Samara Weaving is also an Australian, yet the director evidently thought it would strain credulity to have another character with an Australian accent, and so she didn't have one in the movie. To that end, why was ONE Australian accent appropriate then? And why for that character? It was just an unnecessary detail! 

Additionally, Kerry Condon is another actress with a foreign (Irish) accent who is asked to not use the accent in the movie. Clearly the author understood having a bunch of people with foreign accents traipsing about rural Missouri would seem odd. 

Do you see my frustration? I understand that people with accents can and sometimes do live in rural America but it is not entirely common and in this case, the movie was written to tell the tale of a Southern/Midwestern experience.

I think you're correct in analyzing at least one of the major themes of the film, but there are other themes that lend to the man being the killer.

For example, did Dixon egregiously beat a black suspect as is widely rumoured? I don't recall the movie giving us a clear answer. Dixon himself doesn't defend against the base claim when Mildred calls him out for it, calling her out for her use of the N-word instead. If Dixon did beat the man then we have an example of a group protecting one of their own that might extend to the military protecting the suspect.

And we see that several times throughout the film: Mildred references two examples when chatting with the priest, discussing gang crime and church pedophilia. Or how the town rallies in defence of the chief, or how her ex-husband is expected to (and does) side with the police as a former cop himself, despite it being his daughter too.

As a separate theme, that group behaviour within the police may be an example of ""the blue wall of silence,"" a theme (at least in movies) that applies to the military as well.

That isn't to say that he _definitely is_ the killer, but it's also not clear that is _isn't_. And while you're correct that him being placed in the gift shop may have been a red herring, it's a pretty conspicuous one all other factors considered (e.g. out of state, familiar with the case, not recognized by Willoughby's wife or Dixon, if his story is true then he still raped someone while in the military possibly with fellow servicemen, etc.).",7gs4g9

The scene where the protagonist helps a bug get back on its feet is where it really becomes obvious that the similarity to how certain people like to view certain other people in the current political climate in the US, is not only intentional but self-aware and seemingly used for almost comedic effect.
Without this context all the character choices and behaviors become just really odd.

It isn’t until Willoughby’s suicide and his letters that they gain a little bit of perspective and start some self analysis. That’s why the hospital scene and the dinner scene are so important because it’s both of their character’s finally understanding their actions and seeing how everyone around them has moved on and is trying to heal. The advertising guy forgives Dixon and the Mildred’s abusive ex apologizes for how he had been.

The ending is these two extremely angry and often violent people who have finally taken a breath, and are taking their emotions for what they are instead of giving into them all the time. I personally don’t believe they killed that guy, especially because the car scene has Dixon forgiving Mildred for the burns, and then the two of them not even being sure about killing the rapist.

Religious tension does still exist; yes.  But it's not as intense as it was from the 50's-90's ('The Troubles').  Kids like [this](http://i.imgur.com/kLoE184.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/Iu8whzg.jpg) didn't just disappear, they are alive today and in their 40s/50s/60s and a lot harbour a latent dislike of the British Government because of their heavy-handed tactics during The Troubles.

So aye, there are still tensions, and the odd murder here or there.  The latest was 2009, I believe?  [Two British soliders were shot dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Massereene_Barracks_shooting).

It’s not ridiculous, just unusual enough to merit some kind of setup, such as a throwaway line or some kind of photo display of how well-traveled the family is, or *something* that addresses how unusual the situation is.  And it is unusual; Missouri has little to offer immigrants from more developed nations like Australia.  I was born in, grew up in, and live in Missouri and an Australian immigrant would be unusual in most circumstances, especially in such a rural location.

Meanwhile, movies use Australians, Brits, Irish, Welsh actors to play Americans.  It seems more unusual for one of these actors to play a character of their nationality than as an American, because everyone sees American movies.  And that’s fine.  I just know when the actor and/or director gave up making both the accent and performance work.  And I remember Abbie Cornish trying to speak with a vaguely Southern/Texan/whatever people think a Missouri accent is in her earlier scenes.   Most of us sound like Stephen Colbert.  Rednecks have something of a slight nasal/guttural twang.  We don’t talk like people from the fucking bayou.

It’s all about verisimilitude.  What’s more believable, a British surgeon living in New York City or an Australian playwright living in  Oceola, Missouri?  An Iraqi immigrant living in Oceola, Missouri as a small business owner or an Australian immigrant living as a receptionist for an exterminator business in NYC?  Do they *realistically* belong there?  If not, I’m assuming that the actor just can’t keep an accent and the director gave up on it.  You see it in too many movies not to discount it.

Heading toward murdering a *current enemy* that they have zero reason to forgive, because they don't know him, because he is a perfect, essentially faceless proxy for the real target and cause of their hate. And isn't that what humans do: go through paroxysms of hatred whenever a new specter arises that adequately embodies our fears? We don't learn to not plan murder trips to Idaho, to step back from our emotions at their outset, seeing them for what they are before going off half-cocked. We only dimly come to the conclusion that we should forgive after committing figurative or literal horrific acts of violence and seeing our targets' humanity as they suffer through what we have wrought, just as Mildred and Dixon did throughout the film. Then we make peace with THAT enemy, only to have hatred rise just as sure again at the next thing that scares or hurts us. It's a perfect allegory for the times, imho.

When Mildred and Dixon have the discussion in the car about whether to kill that guy, that's the director talking about his allegorical characters. He's asking, ""so what do you think? Are they going to do it?""  The answer is very obviously different from that to ""should they do it?"" But make no mistake, IT is what humans *DO*.",7gs4g9

I think that scene and that line are integral to our understanding of Mildred's plight through the film.

Everybody will tell her it's not her fault, that she couldn't have known what was coming, but such a disgustingly specific comment would stay with anyone forever.

He connected with burning and raping a young girl so much that it drove him to threaten Mildred after being angered by the news reports on her? 

Going back to the film, during the convo that Dixon overhears in the bar: the guy says, ""no way I'm going down for that shit on the last day down there.""  before he notices Dixon sitting in the booth next to them.  Reading that I think it's safe to say that the film is giving enough examples that he's not the killer without having to assume that Abercrombie is lying.

I think I had some issues with 'paying attention' because that was such a reach to me.  There's no need to be rude.

I see now that his likely motivation for threatening Mildred was that he committed a similar crime with the perpetrator overseas.  When he saw the billboards on the news or was told about it by his partner in crime he got spooked that his initial crime would be found out and decided to take action.

What she doesn't know is that it's the guy that was in the shop, and when she sees him face to face she will presumably recognize this and look more into what he knows. Or they could kill him. Or change their minds. All of these possibilities are meant to give a sense of lacking closure when the film ends. This is how Mildred is supposed to feel about the loss of her daughter.",7gs4g9

dqmu6qd,"The way I see it, since the movie pretty explicitly tells us he is not the real killer, there are two options. Either he saw the news story about the billboards, looked up the details of the murder, and is crazy enough to want to make people think he's the killer (like Mildred and the guy at the bar), or he and his squad did something very similar while they were deployed in Afghanistan.",7gs4g9

I can guarantee that there are plenty of small towns with just 6 white cops to make up the precinct. And I really think you missed the point of the whole film, if you thought that all the cops were incompetent. Willoughby was right: what could he have done differently to catch the criminal? Sometimes people just get away with crimes and it’s not from the police not trying.

They had the “angelic heroine” treat Peter Dinklage’s character very cruelly. They had the “racist cop” face his insecurities and try to be better.

Not until her date with James and her run in with her ex, does she realize that the ex husband was the one who did it. 

She then feels guilt for causing harm to Dixon and confesses to him at the end. Dixon tells her of course he knew it was her, possibly signaling some growth for his character (as Red was able to show a kind gesture to Dixon at the hospital, Dixon sought to make amends with Mildred).",7gs4g9

I'd say it's like an 8 overall.

And I suppose I was overly rude and apologize for that but it's annoying that so many people seem to think the guy might still be guilty despite the DNA not matching the crime scene, and more so because that seemed very clearly to not be the story being told here.

IRL, once a crime similar to this (a murder with no arrest) hits the media & becomes public, it is unfortunately not uncommon for some twisted fuck to contact a member of the victims family and take responsibility for, or claim knowledge of, the crime...especially if the crime has national exposure, as was the case here after the billboards went up.

I was hoping for the perp to get caught and disappointed when it was revealed the DNA didn't match, but this film wasn't a whodunnit, so upon reflection, I am OK with it now.

dvxhkn6,"I've read a number of your responses and I think you're forgetting or maybe you just don't know, but DNA evidence to the negative is not proof of innocence. 

There are numerous cases, high profile cases, where DNA was collected under faulty conditions. It can be contaminated easily. It's not a perfect science. And she was burned, which further complicates things. There's a lot of room for little fuck ups here. Or if there were multiple perpetrators, like he said in the film, it could simply be that they didn't get his DNA but someone else's. 

But the movie makes several allusions to it possibly being him despite a lack of DNA evidence. And to have him show up at the shop, and literally tell her ""Maybe I did rape and murder your daughter"" with no discernable other reason for him to be there, that's just hard to ignore. 

It's not definitive, but there is a large amount of ambiguity there. It's still highly possible that this guy is one of the perpetrators of that murder/rape. Or maybe he's not, but if he was it would fit right in with the themes of the movie of authority covering things up and with the circumstantial evidence and other clues in the writing. ",7gs4g9
