furno2c,"I want to narrow in on something very specific:

Does it rub anyone else the wrong way that the bulk of the villains that are mowed down are random Vietnamese guys? Yes, the main important villain was a rich white dude (and I get it, wealthy imperialists make the lower class fight among themselves), but the cannon fodder is a group of people that basically have as much claim to the gold as the bloods do. Clearly the movie is concerned about the way the US used and abused black Americans during the conflict, but it seems like it doesn't care much for the Vietnamese who faced the same sorts of manipulation and oppression. It pays lip service to the concept ""The American War turned families against one another"" but by about the half way point it kinda just drops that compassionate comparison. Suddenly it's ""Bloods good, Vietnamese bad."" and never provides a real resolution to the notion that the two groups should by all rights be on the same side.",h7ailm
furow7s,"I understand everything Spike Lee wanna says for black people throughout the film, and Vietnam is only the background for the whole story. But as a Vietnamese, that background is very wrong, unrealistic, illogical, and shows that his crew was too lazy and did not do enough research about Vietnam.

The bar scene is cliche. Apocalypse is a real bar, and disabled kid like in the film is unlikely to get inside. Why is he disabled though? Because of the war? He was born in the XXI century. And how the hell can he get firecrackers? They are banned here for years. A beggar like him can afford firecrackers just to throw them at random foreign guys? That scene is bullshit, though I understand Lee wanna portrays their trauma.

Before that a little bit, the cheers scene is cliche. We did that in many propaganda films. So it may be big for Americans, but not so much to Viet. It feels even forced. We moved on.

To the floating market, why trying to sell chickens to tourists? That is laughable. How did he know these characters were GI? Once again, it was very, very forced and unrealistic. We moved on from this phase long ago and do not bear hatred towards Americans.

Vietnamese in the film are stereotypes. Who are these guys with rifle in the jungle? Cops, military, ex-military? No. Stereotype villains? Yes. I doubt that the government allow people to run around with guns like that, especially involving foreign people (I am talking about these French). You would say they paid under-table money to get into the jungle, and acquire some stupid paper showing at the beginning. No! If the government knows about the area, with these gunners running around, these four guys would never be allowed inside, even with a lot of money. 

You can say what you want, but the Vietnam background in the movie shows that Americans hasn’t moved on and still keeps a lot of prejudice towards the country. I appreciate the messages for black people. But other than that, it is a failure.

It seems like Spike Lee must not put much faith in his audience‘s intelligence, because everything was explained, including actions, thoughts, and feelings of every character.

fuyympw,Solid first half at least.,h7ailm
fuz49p4,"Spike Lee has a few gems and a few bombs in his filmography, and this joint feels like a compilation series of both.

The first half of this film was very solid. My biggest gripe is when Otis goes to see the girl -- the acting in this scene from her was bad beyond comprehension as to how she got hired. Everything else I highly enjoyed and the stylistic choices I found to be very suitable. The aspect ratio switches, the choice to keep them old in the flashbacks, everything had me hooked. Funny enough, I actually stopped this movie midway through because I had to go to sleep and I picked back up on it today.

And honestly I wish I stopped there. The very MOMENT this movie goes to complete hell is when the first guy blows up. It felt like the cheapest route to go narratively to raise the stakes and keep conflict. At this point, I was like ""why the hell couldn't they have just gone home and spent their money, happy ending?"" I liked the scene of getting the son off the mine, and I wish they switched that moment around so it could be the last thing that happens when they're in the jungle -- it would've been a great climax -- then they go home and I would've felt very satisfied. I would've felt they found the gold in an oddly easy way, but hey, better than what happens next. But nope, more unnecessary emotion porn needs to occur.

Now we have to deal with the landmine experts, the soldiers searching for the gold, Paul going apeshit, a double cross from a French man, and a big shoot out that results in most of them dying, and for WHAT? What did any of that add to the film? With the main message being about the war haunting these people and the torture it puts on others, everything had already been said. It turned into a cheap action movie with the dumb twist of Paul accidentally killing Norman too -- WHY? Can't he just be fucked up for the sake of being in a fucked up war, we have to add some guilty conscious bullshit too?

I'm not sure of Lee's intent with the second half. Was it supposed to feel like a nightmare? Like a bad drug trip? If so, he succeeded, but what is that trying to convey? How is it suitable to fit with the first half of the movie which felt fairly by the numbers for a Lee movie?

Anyway, Delroy Lindo was fantastic, but this movie needed another rewrite, and if not, at least another draft of editing to trim this thing at least 15-20 more minutes down. I didn't HATE it, but I am very disappointed because it could've been great all around. Instead, they threw on an extra hour and a half for what felt like no reason.

First half -- 8/10. Second half -- 4/10. Overall -- 6/10",h7ailm

When the character with the pigeon feet was walking backwards holding a gold bar above his head, I knew the time had come, just because of the way it was shot/edited. I think it would have been better if they'd excised the 'landmine removal crew' entirely.

fy09xfs,"A bit late but - I really enjoyed it. A lot of people here are both overpraising and also over-hating the film.

The writing was a bit mediocre, some plot points were super thin, there were a few major cliches and the editing during the action scenes was not that great, the soundtrack choices for scenes were very poor (a huge exception is the scene with Marvin Gaye singing). Also the fact that the film portrayed Vietnamese in such a negative light was pretty shitty.

Another issue I had with the film was the graphic historical images/videos throughout the film. I think they are extremely important to the film and definitely make it more impactful - but when I was watching the opening scene I was just not expecting to see a real execution. Once I knew that things like that were going to be in the film I was fine but I think a warning at the beginning would've been nice to have.

While this movie had a lot of bad, it also had a lot of good - the cinematography was gorgeous, the acting was amazing and the writing for the dialogue was actually really good. Not only this but the portrayal of PTSD in this film was incredible.",h7ailm

Maybe it gets better, but the first 1/3 of that screenplay must be confusing as hell story-wise. It's not going anywhere interesting, and if it is, it's not doing it in a worthwhile way. I may have stuck it out, but I was watching it with someone else who felt the same way, so we felt the need to turn it off.",h7ailm
fw8400d,"I just finished watching it, and I thought it was pretty good. I don't think it was anywhere as good as BlacKkKlansman. But I thought the highs - Delroy Lindo's performance, Marvin Gaye's vocals, the Vietnam flashbacks - were really high. The lows weren't incredibly low, but they certainly dragged the film down a bit. I think it could have been 30 minutes shorter and cut the Netflix-action-shootout third act and really just been tighter. 

But I give BlacKkKlansman a 9.5/10. I would probably give this a 7.5/10. 

One thing I don't think I've seen mentioned too much is the framing of the Make America Great Again hat. When Paul first puts it on, we don't even see it. Someone asks if it's a MAGA hat. From then on (and I could be wrong), but most shots have the hat backward on Paul's head or the sun or lens flare blocks out the words. 

It isn't until toward the end of the film that we get a really good look at the actual words, ""Make America Great Again."" And that's when the Vietnamese guy takes it from Paul, when Jean Reno wears it, and when he throws it on Otis. It's interesting that it's only when the antagonists have the hat that we see the words, or when it is thrown on a protagonist as he's about to be killed.",h7ailm
g8n6291,"WARNING. Real life Violence.

Not enough warnings about this film, there are real life executions (video) and many horrific real images (a child who's been shot dead; in the face for instance...)

These images pop up out of nowhere, you don't have a chance to avert your gaze.

Thrusting that on people is sadistic and not the sign of a good director who uses skill to evoke feelings and psychological states.

The film itself was amateurish.... really was poorly written and directed. The acting was mostly pretty poor with exception of the Vet with PTSD, who was very good in it.

I won't give a moment more of my time to this asshole of a director.

fuvra8q,"By the time Jean Reno appears wearing a MAGA hat and a shootout begins that should, frankly, be beneath a film like this, I kind of made peace with the fact that it would never rise above 'pulpy shlock with some potent social commentary'. It's fine. Whatever complaints I had, I'm familiar enough with Spike Lee style at this point to know that he's a little extra, always will be and there's no point whining about it. Delroy Lindo was incredible and will win an Oscar for this role.

Edit: One outright negative I will talk about that has been mentioned elsewhere in the comments - this film's depiction of Vietnam as a country today is fucking bullshit and felt borderline irresponsible. I realise Spike Lee just wanted to make an entertaining movie that focused on the experience of black soldiers, but when it comes to the Vietnamese people, you have to make a choice - either present their country as a lawless hellhole and them as stereotypes, **or** constantly use archival footage and photos of their slaughter. You can't have it both ways, and the latter comes off as exploitative and disingenuous when taken with the former. I respect Spike Lee intention to depict the horrors suffered by America's black soldiers, but it rings hollow when he does the same old American colonialist bullshit and uses the country as a hollow backdrop and the people as props for the story he wants to tell.

But here I am complaining about Spike Lee's style exactly like I promised I wouldn't when I initially posted haha",h7ailm

1. Weird drastic shifts in tone / Amazing message!
2. Generic lifetime movie music / The BEST use of Marvin Gaye I've ever seen. Amazing Capella choice. 
3. Generic forest and hotel sets / Beautiful cinematography.
4. No explanation for the Trump supporter and it feels forced / Surgically compares the today's situations to the '60's.

I felt I was watching a combination of Tropic Thunder, City Slickers, Apocalypse Now, and Born on The 4th of July.  I'm trying to make sure that I'm not biased to liking this movie because of what's currently happening in the U.S but I think this is just one of those films that shines exceptionally when it works but still has some major problems.  I really really wish Spike Lee was more consistent but he's also clearly a genius.",h7ailm
fxrxxbl,"The only problems I had were a bit major for me. I thought it was weird that when Eddie died, no one really anguished in pain or lamented. No tears shed for a fallen brother even if hes blown to bits. 

I attributed this to the fact that they have PTSD and that over the years they have become desensitized to pain, death and suffering, as evidenced in Paul's frequent dreaming of Norman (guilt). 

But really?? Considering the fact that these guys have a serious bond toughened by war experiences I assumed it would have been way more hurtful to them.

But in a way this might be genius. War is dysfunctional. Correct me if I'm wrong but a more subtle message is that dysfunctional things and arbitrary chaos arise from such events?? Vietnam was a disaster and extremely chaotic and brutal. Though their bonds are forged in steel, they are forged in brutality, coldness and blood - with war, perhaps their humanity has been forsaken. The group is dysfunctional because war is dysfunctional. If so, genius move.

Also, as others pointed out, it was weird and a bit dumb how at one point, David is friends with Hedy at the bar, then when they see each other, Paul takes them hostage. Theres a lot of tension right after with Hedy taunting David. Then in the middle of the night when they take the gun away from Paul, they seem much more amicable even though the LAMB trio are literal hostages who only wanted to do good. Even they arent let go. If I was taken hostage, I'd definitely be pissed and continue to do so. 

And then after they just seemed like friends, even after Seppo got blown up by a mine (in a predicament he wouldn't be in if it were not for Paul). But I do appreciate that this bit got a bit more emotional as Hedy and the other guy cried over Seppos death, but similarly to Eddie's, they got over it really quickly!! And they dont have PTSD or fought in a war.

Vinh was my favourite such a chill cool guy... is it normal to be casually willing to fight against a militia with the high risk of dying?

Have to say that I loved Marvin's songs being woven throughout. Love the album so the moment I first heard the first song I smiled. Such a significant album with meanings and lessons echoing today. Similarly, I thought the flashbacks were cool.

One thing I didnt really like was that Norman was meant to be a well-respected figure who past down lessons to the Bloods. He preached compassion and love, but this wasnt strongly demonstrated. Do I just assume this is because of PTSD? Perhaps also taking into account these guys are tired vets who have perhaps become a bit senile in their old age (which is common). This might then be a very good decision by Spike 

Acting was good, especially by Lindo. Boseman is naturally charismatic so great casting. Many themes woven through and many messages could be interpreted, the most obvious being about racial injustice but more nuanced ones being about bonds forged in war, human nature and fragility of morality.

All in all, enjoyable casually but doesnt even tough KKKlansman.",h7ailm
fuzs3iq,"I stayed up late to watch this last night and wish I hadn't bothered.

From the director's credentials I was expecting a poignant, relevant tour-de-force of social commentary. What I ended up watching was more like a poorly lashed together and simplistic adventure movie with some social issues nailed on in a failed attempt to give it some gravitas and meaning.

History lesson aside the film is poor. While I did find it reasonably engaging at times the storyline is basic, often predictable, clumsy and relies on a raft of ridiculous concidences in a failed attempt to make it ""work"" (quotations because it doesn't work at all).

The acting is often a bit ropey, the characters somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. I found the use of the same actors in the flashbacks confusing since they looked pretty much the same despite there being around 50 years separating the two sets of events.

I didn't find the content of the story itself conveyed any particular moral message and found the main storyline of effectively a load of blokes going to retrieve gold they'd stolen diluted / undermined the moral high-ground demanded by the film's historical content.

That said I accept the suggestion that taking the gold was somewhat legitimised since it belonged effectively to the oppressors of the protaganists; although you could also make an argument for it belonging to its intended south-vietnamese recipients who were effectively paid off by the CIA as a convenient ally for fighting their ideoligical war. Perhaps that's another somewhat deeper angle - that despite the passage of time two groups of people once explolited by a world superpower are still divided through conflict over the riches it used to do its bidding.

Bottom line this appears to be a film of two distinct parts; a really low-grade adventure flick that misses the target on most counts, interspersed with a serious history lesson on oppression and exploitation that carries a heavy moral message.

While I can appreciate the desire to convey the historical / moral message in an accessible mainstream film, its gravitas and legitimacy are severely undermined by attaching it to such a mediocre and clumsy vehicle as provided by the fictional part of the film. It seems that the historical content has been added to this treasure-hunting caper in a misguided and somewhat tasteless attempt to give it some legitimacy, which largely fails.. to the extent that combining the two seems disrespectful towards / devalues the serious moral argument it's trying to push.

It seems almost akin to editing a Carry-On film with historial cut-scenes of the women's rights movements and trying to sell it as a legitimate analysis of gender inequality, or perhaps trying to push a Roger Moore Bond film as a serious deconstruction of geopolitical tensions.

The grounding of the film in the historical interludes suggests it wants to be considered a serious commentary on war and race; however falls well, well short of this and comes absolutely nowhere close to the classics of these two genres.

Remove the historical references and the director's perceived gravitas and what you're left with is a 4/10 at best, straight-to-video quality, instantly-forgettable caper that would have been too long at 90 minutes - let alone its sprawling 2.5hr duration.

Wanted to like it, instead found it misguided and disappointing. Really can't understand why it's had such good reviews in some quarters, other maybe that due to fear of criticising it given the current relevance of the message it tries but fails to deliver..?

I agree fully with Spike's message but it was about as subtle as a jackhammer in your living room. Give the audience some credit Spike, or he must think his audience is dumb as hell. It made the dialogue in the movie seem so unrealistic and sometimes corny.

I would've excused all that considering the good message he was trying to get across, but then the mixed messages later on in the film?? I mean I am all for realism, and showing how f'ed up and confusing the world can be, but it just became a muddled mess that never led to a definitive conclusion.

Delroy Lindo once again proved he is an underrated, talented and brilliant actor. The same with Chadwick.

My favorite scene was the Hanoi Hannah scene, it reminded me of what Spike does best, although it did feel as though he was ripping off his own movie; Miracle at St. Anna.

But seriously, was it the four different writers? Was it that it was originally supposed to be an Oliver Stone film? Cus that what it felt like;  Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, and Spike Lee all getting into an editing/writing piss fight and reconciling on something that doesn't completely hold up.

It's a different take and weird at first, but it made sense since they used that old time footage filter on the shots. Delroy's story was the most interesting and probably the best acted of all of them. The plot itself was quite intriguing and the exploration of what the Bloods went through during and after the war was done pretty well. Also thought it was cool that they found a mixed race actress to play Otis + Tien's daughter. 

The things that I didn't like were that it was quite lengthy and not really subtle at all. That plus the convenience of everything just showing up at the right time- for example:

The movie felt too long for me. I kept checking the time and got distracted by my phone near the end. There wasn't enough of character development for me to develop a lot of feelings for them. Paul was heavily portrayed as the bad guy that when he died, it just felt like a relief.   
That being said, I appreciate the movie for mentioning the children of U.S. soldiers that were left behind after the war. This group has always been neglected by both sides and having a tough time living in Vietnam. OK, some goof trivia: The conversation between the mother (Tien) and the daughter (Michon) after she met her dad for the first time was very unnatural, especially when the daughter said, ""Tell me the truth. Finally."" and ""You owe me this."" They were literal word-by-word translation from those 2 English sentences and nobody talks like that in Vietnamese lol",h7ailm
fvibcnr,"Man, I both hated and loved this film. The acting by Delroy Lindo was phenomenal, he carried a lot of this movie for me. The stand out scene was the PTSD scene on the boat, I felt the panic in Paul and it was an incredibly strong scene. However, this film just felt bloated, I kept expecting them to be getting to the climax only for it to drag on and on. There’s also certain spike leeisms that you come to expect in his films that still kinda put me off.

Again overall, liked the idea, but felt the movie was weaker in some areas. Everybody played their parts, but sometimes the film forcefed you a little too much on the plot and character motivations.

You'll either love it or hate it. Me personally: Not Spike's masterpiece, but definitely not bad.",h7ailm
fv6crvc,"Okay I was digging the beginning but as soon as buddy blew up from the landmine, the son gets stuck trying not to die from one he stepped on, and the minefield expert people showed up, I turned it off.

No offense to people who liked the movie, I like some spike lee movies but this one was a dud for me.",h7ailm

Then returning 50 years later to kill some more Vietnamese people. Who even were the Vietnamese villains at the end? Some gang? How did they know about the gold? Why were they patrolling the jungle in the first place?

Also why did da bloods not really give a shit when da first blood got blown up by a landline? I mean, he was their brother as much as Norm...

And why did they all keep going along with Paul’s insane antics?

Lastly, none of them had any acknowledgement at the end about whether everything they’d just done was morally justifiable...

So much of the film just felt... off... in a way. Still trying to make sense of it, even though I enjoyed it overall.",h7ailm

But wow some of it was just really bad. The editing was bad all around, the score (sans Marvin Gaye) was generic and overbearing, the pace was jarring, and a lot of it felt like an old person buddy movie a la The Bucket List.

Delroy Lindo was great, these last monologues were crazy. i actually like the opening montage, Spike accidentally made a movie exactly for these times. and it's crazy how messages of Angela Davis, MLK, Mohammed Ali, Malcolm X as well as Marvin Gaye's music are still relevant today.

i'm kinda surprised that people here are weirded out by the usage of slides, Lee has been doing for a long time.

fv869zb,"Damn. This movie half sucked but was half good at the same time. The editing was so fucking all over the place and inconsistent. It was like it WANTED to have this stylishness to it but only every so often, so those weird repeated cuts that showed up here and there felt so out of place. 

The score was also god fucking awful. I guess they wanted to emulate early hollywood shit, but unlike a Tarantino film, it doesn't know how to utilize it. It felt cheap and corny as absolute fuck. The soundtrack on the other hand was alright. I love Marvin Gaye, but the point his music served was just to be a cheap walking montage cause I guess Spike doesn't know how to address a passage of time more creatively. 

Also some of the acting was fucking terrible. The main 5 Bloods were all good (Delroy Lindo fucking knocked it out the park), but literally everyone else was just utter trash. I mean goddamn, that one chick is really smiling after learning about David's dead mom and only a couple hours after her friend-with-benefits just got blown to smitherines. The only good Vietnamese actor was the chicken dude and the radio chick. The rest were either bland or embarrassingly bad. David was corny as fuck. 

The shootouts also had zero weight to them. The score didn't help whatsoever when it's just a loud ass, typical hero song that we've heard a million times. It wasn't realistic, nor was it over the top. It was just generic and boring. I also didn't believe one fucking second that any of the actors were in an actual fucking warzone. 

However, this movie still nailed some shit. Essentially every seen with Paul was phenomenal. The counter-twist where we were all expecting them to show that Paul murdered Norman selfishly, to find out it was just an accident was really well done. Chadwick Boseman also killed it as Norman. He definitely had some corny moments, but it was still believable. 

All of the mine shit was done well, save for Eddie's death. That was so fucking obvious. 

Anyways, the message was still very strong and felt sincere. There were a lot of fucking problems with this movie but overall, it's fine. Sadly, there's nothing necessarily memorable about this film, though.",h7ailm
fuplrqy,"I don't know if this was Spike Lee condensing every trope of Hollywood Vietnam films into one giant criticism in which case it was a success, or if it was actually sincere in which case what the fuck happened?

It was almost like watching two completely different movies glued together in the middle, right up until Eddie dies and then some stereotypical Hollywood ""old soldiers win"" type of deal, and to be honest it was the first half that I found to be the better movie. 

Delroy Lindo was exactly right all the way through, even with the letter monologue but everything else of the ending just seemed kludged together.

This is either exactly what he was aiming for, or has completely missed the mark and to be honest I don't know which it is but I don't think I liked it either way which I'm sorry for because I came into this absolutely ready to love it.",h7ailm

fxe1nyv,"This is the first hard miss by Spike Lee for me personally, and it's bothering me somewhat because Spike is probably the first director that I knew the name of as a child. I didn't relate to him or his movies because of any arbitrary attribute that we both possess, I related to his movies because they took me to places I would not have grown up in, and shown me what those places were like for those that inhabited them. I hope that this isn't him losing a step because I grew up on his films, and always deeply respected him, and his visions despite all the shit he would get for being unabashedly ""pro-black"" in his films.

I only saw what he was trying to do in the Vietnam War scenes in retrospect. I loved the choice of using the actors in their current ages in flashbacks without de-aging them or using a stand-in, I only wish that it had been made more clear that it was a flashback, and how memory never de-ages us in those, rather than it being a story element showing us the past as accurately as possible. I love the choice of intersplicing culturally important figures, while some felt entirely appropriate within the context of the moment, a couple felt incredibly out of place, and shoehorned so much that I worried that the film was attempting to be a ""cool"" educational film.

I feel that if Spike had introduced the story, the part of the film following the Ali clip, with a camera focusing on Delroy Lindo's face staring off at the hotel before he begins walking towards, and then past the camera, and following just behind him as he entered the hotel, and until he arrived at the hotel desk to meet with the rest of the bloods that it would have better put me in the mindset that he is the ""main"" character, and it would not have felt so disjointed, and jarring when the story alternated between his PTSD, and the rest of the story. It set the film off on the wrong foot from which it never recovered.

Also, unless I missed it, and any possible clues implying the twist, when were we led to believe that Jean Reno was ultimately going to be the bad guy? I was under the impression that everything was simply going wrong, and that the accusation he was involved was the direct result of irrational thinking due to the shock of everything going wrong.

I feel like the message with the bloods dying over the gold was supposed to be that no one was innocent and that no one deserved that gold. However, that was quickly discarded at the very end when people got their checks. I feel that the ending would have been much stronger if no one ended up with a share of it.

Also, what the fuck activists? Jasper Pääkkönen dies, and they don't seem to really give a shit, unemotionally asking ""So, we get a cut, right?""

Delroy Lindo's character was the only character that was believable, which was ironic given that he was supposed to be the most broken, and destroyed. His decisions made the most sense given his character that he was portraying.

Overall, I felt that the story was at best passable but, the execution of the story was so weak that it drug down the film, and choices such as the deaths from landmines made me laugh heartily when I should have been shocked. The deaths felt more comedic than serious.",h7ailm

fwyo97b,"I think the most compelling aspect of the film for me was the fact that it wasn’t a definitive pro-Black film. 

Yes, there were major elements of the film that were meant to uplift and glorify the Black community: the stock footage of important actors and agents in the civil rights movement, the whole “Black people were and are victims of systemic racism” narrative, gorgeous use of Marvin Gaye’s music, etc. 

But the film also presented many issues that the Black community may consider uncomfortable to confront and speak about: PTSD and mental health in general, emotional sensitivity of men towards other men, their own xenophobia as Americans, etc. 

And for this to be released when BLM sentiment is at an all-time high, imho, makes Spike Lee one of the bravest directors this year. 

Cinematic execution aside (sound, dialogue, aspect ratio changes, etc), I fully expect this to get at least one or even a few nominations in major categories in film awards this year.",h7ailm

Obviously a bit more polish is needed in some areas but the soundtrack with the isolated Marvin Gaye tunes were amazing. One of my Spike Lee favourites for sure and feels very much needed today with America’s socio-political climate. A cold reminder of the past.

fulqrs3,"Liked it, didn't love it. There are some extremely powerful scenes in this movie (Delroy's POV pieces, the BLM scene near the end) and some phenomenal acting (especially Lindo), but as with a lot of Lee's films he can't really get out of his own way as a filmmaker.

I thought the war movie parody flashbacks were amusing the first couples of times he did it but it ultimately felt like recycling a gag that wasn't really that clever in the first place.

Also he's not a naturally gifted action director and the final setpiece in particular was really rough and sloppy looking. Hated the obvious CGI blood and muzzle flash throughout; despite the gorgeous cinematography it gave it a bit of a VOD action-thriller vibe.

Also thought it was odd that all the subtitled non-english dialogue had the letter of every word capitalised for some reason.

I'd give it a 7/10. I think Lindo and the cinematography should get Oscar nominations but this feels a bit sloppy for a Best Picture contender IMO.",h7ailm
fvaa55y,"Man, I am of two minds here, I love the concept and how it relates to black culture, the war and old timers coming to terms with themselves. But the execution in some parts was really god awful. The pacing of this movie is extremely strange. Some scenes just carry on for way too long until it’s uncomfortable. When the son meets the French girl we find out she is a landmine specialist, I knew a landmine was going to come into play, especially when using the metal detector, I kept waiting for it to happen on that hill and it didn’t. 

That would’ve been a natural place and an exciting place for it to happen, at the height of finding the gold but also something awful happening at the same time. But instead they go to a whole different scene, and the guy who hasn’t talked the whole movie hardly, starts on this monologue, and the direction is so weird because you know something is going to happen, they start framing him by himself and he’s walking backwards to get into “position”. The characters even comment on it! Like the directing was super bad sometimes. It felt like watching a bad stage play. 

Right when the son steps on it, that girl appears, I’m sorry, give me a fucking break. They should have had someone else step on it, and the son run back to the Village to get the girl. But that’s not even the biggest issue, they like immediately start talking strategy coherently and their best friend just exploded. Like as if it didn’t happen at all

Also some of the musical scores Felt strangely similar to black Klansman, which gave this underlying weird tension throughout, when really nothing bad happens until the landmine scene, so I thought it just had a strange tone.",h7ailm

fv7f041,"War movies are probably my favorite genre of film, and a Spike Lee take on what happened in Vietnam is a compelling proposition so I've been looking forward to this one.

After watching it however, I didn't like it as much as I hoped I would. There's some choices that were made that I don't agree with, but I can kind of respect. I found the flashbacks to be distracting and immersion breaking. The special effects felt cheap, and I don't know if that was due to budgetary reasons or wanting to portray these memories through some sort of stylized lense, but it seemed off when contrasted with what was otherwise pretty great cinematography. Same goes the characters not being de-aged in the slightest in these flashbacks. Again, probably an artistic choice, but seeing senior citizens fighting alongside Norm took me out of these moments.

I had a hard time with Paul's character. He's obviously a very deeply wounded man, but at the same time was so quick to turn on everyone including his son. While i understand the damage that was done to him, his portrayal was all over the place. He fights for his son to get a cut of the gold, then disowns/abandons him, dies, and leaves a letter gushing about how he'll always love him. How quickly he turned on the LAMB crew after they helped save David was also a disappointing character development. Generally I found Paul to be a very difficult character to sympathize with, and eventually the others were too in their willingness to go with whatever Paul wanted to do when it came to violence and taking hostages. 

The interactions with the Vietnamese felt very cliche, and I didn't understand the purpose of the scenes with the one-legged panhandler. Why would a panhandler waste money on firecrackers just to throw them at the same people who gave you that very money? It's just confusing.

Overall, the premise is great, the message is timely, and it's the acting was good but the inconsistent presentation and odd character development hurt my enjoyment overall.",h7ailm

Within the first minutes, Spike does what he does best and bluntly tells us what he wants to discuss for the next 2 and a half hours; like the Double V campaign—black soldiers having to fight for freedom overseas and at home—or how hypocritical the US was focused on optics of winning Vietnam and the space race, while simultaneously ignoring the plights of African-Americans on their own turf. 

I even thought having Delroy Lindo be a Trump supporter was an interesting decision that added to the dimension of his character and the development of the story. 

Overall I thought this film was great all around. If Spike Lee’s style isn’t your thing then definitely skip this one. But this film continues to show me that Spike Lee is an ambitious filmmaker who not only loves movies, but loves using that platform to have important conversations; and he’ll always be a hero of mine.",h7ailm

And to the people accusing the film of being pro-black yet anti-Vietnamese, I believe that may have been a conscious decision from Spike Lee.

fv2y5la,Anyone notice the French weren't tied up after they spent so long tying em up?? Lmao,h7ailm
g3yr9pt,"The  film left me with mixed feelings. The ending is NOT explained. The  treasure is not clean, legitimate money up for the taking which is why  it was to be laundered by the French guy who gets killed. Once he is  killed, Lee cuts to a somewhat later time in which the US stamped gold  has somehow been cleaned up and used for very visible donations and  gifts (BLM, a group for those affected by Landmines in Vietnam, etc.).  We also see an official funeral for Norman. Is it likely that millions  of dollars in US stamped gold would be used so  visibly and overlooked  by the US Gov't?  Since the French dude can't help them out from the  grave, how exactly are all the murders (committed for the money) covered  up? How do the survivors just glide back into the normal world outside  the jungle and wind up with checks for 2 million here and 1 million  there with no questions asked?

I  think the feelgood morality of the ending is tacked on without much care  or thoughtfulness. For one thing, the journey back to the heart of the  jungle of Vietnam tears everyone apart. Even when one of the ""bloods""  dies in a tragic explosion while lecturing the others on how to use the  money for reparations, nobody even cries or grieves. Hostilities most of  the parties to this treasure hunt build to a bloodbath crescendo. Then  after Otis cries out ""Madness!"" A fairy tale ending commences replete  with social justice donations based on the gold that has revealed the  inner demons still at work in history and the souls of the characters  embodying it. It may be a positive moral sentiment to end on, but it  does a disservice to what is actually a very dark cinematic journey into  the interior of a jungle in which they both came together yet were  simultaneously torn apart. In sum, the ending feels magical. I've looked  everywhere online to see an explanation for how this money is cleaned  and used to write millions in checks to individuals and charities. Nada.  Maybe someone here can explain it. And even if there were an  explanation, it would still be a 180 degree turn from the anarchic  struggle for loot to high-morality. Didn't feel right.",h7ailm

Don’t get me wrong, I actually really liked the ‘Tarantino-style’ civil rights asides, but IMO that and some Delroy Lindo monologues is all that keeps this from being a B movie and complete bomb.",h7ailm
fynl2f0,"Probably one of my absolute bottom movies ever made (that I’ve seen obviously). I had high hopes, but it felt like a rushed project made to make a deadline to fit the current BLM events or something.

Most times I couldn’t tell if it was a comedy or if it was just poor writing, it felt like a parody of something I couldn’t put my finger on, and it was thoroughly uncomfortable to watch.",h7ailm
fuv9n3i,"My only guess is that the current social climate may have some critics afraid to speak out about this film, because the movie is legitimately bad. It felt as though Tyler Perry tried making a Quentin Tarantino movie, with terrible cinematography and very awkward/nonsensical score and editing. I had very high hopes going in, and couldn't wait for it to be over barely past the halfway point.",h7ailm
fv3hmna,"This movie wasn’t good at all. Terence Blanchard’s score matched up in some scenes but it just sounded awkward. Specifically in the first battle scene when they were at war. At least the cinematography in the combat sequences was Generally good, but it didn’t make up for the rest of the movie. It felt rushed and without any sort of style discernible from other contemporary films that at least had some sort of “look.” Idk why I was expecting a black Vietnam war epic in the same vein as Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. That would have been a dream come true. Unfortunately, Spike Lee isn’t that revolutionary of a filmmaker unless he’s trying to get a race related point across. Since he’s probably the most celebrated black filmmaker of all time, it’s understandable why he would use this platform for that reason and there’s nothing I would do to detract from his wanting to do so. I think that’s great. On paper, this is good shit. The conceptual side of it and the themes are excellent. But the way he executed the story and dialogue etc made me feel like I was watching a fuckin Kevin James movie. 

Most of the characters were annoying. Why did there have to be a love interest for the son whose presence barely made any sense as it is? Why did Isaiah Whitlock Jr. have to reprise the character he plays in the Wire for a Vietnam war film? Overall I thought the acting was pretty poor. It added some interesting character dynamics thankfully, like Clark Peters’ character finding out he had a daughter, but the direction was so fucking sloppy that it didn’t make me care enough about what happened next. Plus Spike Lee’s confusion as to what kind of genre he was going for made me see the film for what it was; one that used African American vernacular English  as a crutch to incite cheap laughter.",h7ailm

The actors did a great job though - Delroy Lindo is a gift of an actor, always delivers.

Worth a watch and an ok film about ex Vietnam vets who go back for one last tragic mission, but leaves themes unexplored and consequences unresolved.",h7ailm

Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Chadwick Boseman and Jonathan Majors are great and my favorite part of the cast(helps they also gets the best to work with), Isiah Whitlock was also good, honestly I just liked the Bloods and their chemistry. But much of the supporting cast could use some work(characters and performances wise). Story wise I liked most of it, but some of Lee’s social commentary(while relevant) is too much on the nose, Lindo’s character is who liked most and the decisions done with him. 
There were some specific things I also disliked like some of the editing, cgi blood(the fighting wasn’t very convincing for the most part imo) and cutting to real life person and pictures when mentioned(some work like the beginning, but other times it feels Lee is trying to hard getting his point with them).",h7ailm

But, I think this movie was trying to do too much, if that makes sense. Messages related to PTSD, racism in America, and corruption felt kind of rammed together and as a result very muddled- as individual subjects they work well, but when put together in this film everything feels cheapened. I can see where they were trying to go but I felt as if they never quite got there (I DO think this is a powerful film, though). Also, I felt like the pacing/tone was kind of a mess- there were a lot of points where I didn't know how  I was supposed to feel about a certain situation, some parts that went on for too long, and some parts that just felt skimmed over.

&#x200B;

This movie portrayed PTSD better than I've ever seen in a film before. Ever. It also felt incredibly real with the relationships between the 4 main characters. I get a feeling that the flashbacks also completely went over people's heads. They were romanticizing the past with Norman. Spike Lee isn't saying it was ACTUALLY like that.

fuqyw8f,"I just finished the movie and it was really great! It was one of my most anticipated movies and it delivered. While watching the movie, I just knew there would be a shit hit the fan moment and once they mentioned landmines I knew it was coming soon and that some group of ""bad guys"" would threaten the Bloods. 

My biggest predictions were Paul succumbing to his PTSD, and revealing him to be responsible for Norm's death. It was scary as hell when he took the LAMB crew hostage and forced everyone to tie them up. Idk why the hell Otis gave him the gun to prove a point cause I knew some shit was gonna happen sooner or later. Anyways, it was tragic to see his downfall and I'm glad he found peace with himself. 

For a Spike Lee movie, I always kept my eye out for any symbolism and theres a lot to unpack. Like many Vietnam movies, it acknowledges just how fucked up Nam was. Those real scenes hit hard. Not to mention how some Vietnamese people still hold Americans accountable for the war (""You killed my mother and brothers""). I like the the parallel where Paul denies that on the boat, but when the leader says ""you killed my brother"", Paul at peace with himself says yes and it was wrong. 

One of the things that kept me thinking was who deserved to get the money. Paul and the group who attack the Bloods both to me represent extremes to that answer. Both demand it as reparations from the war. Paul is callous and will let nothing get in his way for whats his, and the ""bad guy"" group demand it for their country and will kill for it as well. Meanwhile, everyone else wants to help their family or the greater good (BLM, and LAMB).

I've already written a lot, but one piece of symbolism I wanna mention is Otis at the end after they shot his shoulder. The MAGA hat is on top of him, while he's all beaten, near-death, with his hand on his chest making it look like he's doing the Pledge of Allegiance, while he says ""Madness"". The movies still fresh in my mind, but if I had to quickly theorize the meaning, its that the ""madness"" that hat represents (racism and hate) will be responsible for black people being hurt, beaten to near death or killed over and over again in this country. I may be reaching but I would love to hear anyone's thoughts.",h7ailm
futqs15,"I'm actually a big fan of Spike Lee's films but this one was a bit lukewarm for me. There's a lot of good ideas and things I like, but despite the brilliant concept, I just don't think Spike Lee's heart was really in this one. A lot of the way it was edited and filmed felt almost like he was playing up tropes that we associate with his films, like he was trying to tick all of the boxes. It is also a bit too long for its own good.

&#x200B;

It is still worth a watch, to be sure, especially for the incredible performances. Everybody knocked it out of the park, but Delroy Lindo did an exceptionally good job.

&#x200B;

All in all, it wasn't Spike Lee's best, and I for some reason I felt like he didn't do enough to explore the experiences of black soldiers and marines in Vietnam. Maybe more focus on making the flashback sequences more realistic and less cheesy and action-oriented would've helped with that.

futztky,"It's alright . Maybe it's just the case of overexpectation after the great reviews it got. It's pretty hit or miss, the performances were top notch with Delroy Lindo in top form. Clarke Peters and Isaiah Whitlock Jr were great ( both whom I love since The Wire) so were the others. Chadwick Boseman had a few powerful scenes. 


But I found the editing to be too flashy and also the dialogue to be too preachy at times, the change of aspect ratio also felt jarring in places and took me out of the movie. I think the movie tried to tackle many issues and didn't do complete justice to any of them.

Isiah Whitlock Jr. was curiously underutilized and should feel insulted that he was primarilly used as comic material - it was almost as if the film about 5 'blood' brothers was only interested in two main characters (see above) instead of the  shifting dynamic between troubled war veterans.

&#x200B;

And for a film about the injustices of racism, it's really disquieting (and galling) to see such a racist depiction of the Vietnamese.

There are some stellar acting in here, especially Lindo's performance, and the message the film is trying to push forward is very significant and powerful. But subty this movie isn't.

The political and social message are way too much on the nose, the numerous fast cut of Wikipedia images and short clips whenever they are talking about a historical fact, event or figure are extremely erratic, and really don't belong there. You either make a documentary, or you make a film, you can't go chase two rabbits at the same time and hope to come back with both. Subty is more often than not much more compelling and persuasive than trying to ram your message into the audience every 5 minutes with a soliloquy or irrelevant excerpt of a speech by Black civil rights movement figures. 

The plot has a great premise, but it develops into quite a mess that becomes very hard to follow because character motivations are muddled, and their behavior sometimes illogical given the circumstances. And the whole plot of them trying to recover the gold and Norman's remains while battling the local bandits don't connect at all to the overall political and social message.

Conclusion: As a social and political commentary it's worth a watch, but the action and battle sequences are really awful. And Spike Lee is preaching to the choir, it won't reinforce the movement or convert anyone to the other side because its message is delivered too heavy-handed.",h7ailm

Also the ending with the shot of Otis and his daughter smiling directly at the camera seemed really out of place and kinda unsettling. Why was that the last scene of any of the characters? I got the impression that Paul was the primary Blood in the story, not Otis. Just seemed like an odd decision on Lee's part.

The first part of the movie is slow, but fine enough, I guess. You're getting the backstory, a little character development, and the slap-you-in-the-face political message of the movie (and if anyone is surprised by this... have you never seen a Spike Lee movie before...?)

Then the ""treasure hunt"" part of the movie really gets things moving along. But... there's still two hours left...?!

It's the last third of the movie where things get totally insane. It reminded me of Midsommar in some ways, where you don't even really know if what you're watching is meant to be reality or not. Like the shootout scene... how did that plot of the movie even come together? How did we get to a by the numbers action movie? Is it real? Is it the soldiers dreaming of their own past action hero glories? The editing, like someone mentioned about the quick cut to the grave digging scene, seems to give this part of the movie the pacing of a bad trip... so... I'm not sure.

To me, the movie was written as ""this is going to be an Oscar movie."" The dialogue, the sappy friendship, the father/son aspect, and the politics all seem sort of by the numbers Oscar baiting.

I don't know what some people were expecting here but Spike Lee is essentially a very successful indie filmmaker, so yea the film is quirky but ultimately I think it was great and explored topics not really covered in media especially today. 

Because I know people will attack my last point, it's not very common for there to be an active conversation in 2020 on Black men fighting in Vietnam War, their conflict of interests, and the PTSD that comes from fighting in a war let alone with a country that oppresses you. 

For the vets to be the main characters was interesting and you never really see popular movies with older black men leading.

Maybe it was just a weird script here but here's hoping the next one will be more on the level blackkklansman was.

ful4h0m,"I’m flabbergasted by the high rottentomatoes score. 

Have watched 40 minutes so far, and it’s getting exhausting. Every single cloying scene has to have historical footage and slides and photographs spliced in, the plot feels like a history lesson and not in a good way. 

And so much of the dialogue is preachy or feels like a lecture. Meeting with Jean Reno? Lecture session about French vs US military bonafides. Random flashback to radio broadcast? Radio lecture on black soldiers serving a corrupt country that killed MLK. 

I don’t know how lingering on a photo of a soldier for 5 seconds after his name is mentioned in dialogue isn’t clumsy and unnecessary. Why do we need a frame showing 2 Vietnam era propaganda posters at the same time? What narrative purpose does that serve? Is this Spike Lee’s very special feature film YouTube video? 

Also (spoilers ahead):

The choice to have the 50 year old actors play younger twenty-something versions of themselves in Vietnam is a distraction that I can’t believe happened, what has the Irishman wrought upon us. 

When they decide to steal the gold from the US government originally meant for the Lahu people in the flashback, they justify it by saying black soldiers have been exploited for so long and they deserve the gold. 

Right away this is a questionable moral justification from the Norman character. He is supposed to be a leader but he makes no bones about stealing gold from the CIA, as a soldier this seems like it would be a difficult choice at the very least. 

When the former special ops guys in Triple Frontier tried to steal the drug money, they tried to think of themselves as the good guys that deserved a win after feeling exploited their whole lives, but they always knew they were morally compromised from the beginning. 

There was power in that moral conflict, and da 5 bloods has none of that...the soldiers’ decision to steal the gold is unquestioned, but I guess that’s a directorial choice. A YouTube history lesson caper needs a different tone maybe. 

I’ve liked a lot spike Lee’s movies: Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, He Got Game, Summer of Sam, Bamboozled. 

But throughout this whole thing so far, I’m wondering when it starts to get decent. Is this what happens when Netflix gives a big director a budget to do whatever they want? 

If it gets awesome in the remaining checks notes 1 hour and 52 minutes of running time then I’ll gladly retract my spite.

EDIT:

It didn’t get awesome, but it got better at the point where they find Norman. 

There’s definitely a watchable movie in there, it’s just buried under a mountain of useless setup. It’s a 2 and a half hour movie that has zero business being that long, when there’s only about 100 minutes max worth of story.

The first 65 minutes of the movie needs to be cut down to 15-20 minutes, that first hour does not need so much undisciplined filler...feels like Lee’s trying to cram the entire civil rights and black Vietnam war experience into that entire hour, and it hurts the movie. 

Keep most of the movie from 1 hour and 7 minutes (when they daytime hike before finding the gold) until the end (1 hour and 20 minutes total without credits), trim the gold-finding scene, cut out Hanoi Hannah. 

That would be an ok theatrical cut that deserves about a 75% RT score for a decent enough socially conscious genre movie. 

As it is, this bloated Netflix cut is only tolerable when you skip forward to 1 hour and 7 minutes, and then watch the 80 minute movie that remains.",h7ailm

fuq8ise,"I had really high expectations for this and came out a little underwhelmed, though I still think it's a solidly good movie. Neither as fun nor as clever as Blackkklansman but if this gets a little overpraised by critics I'll take it as payback for the last like 20 years of everyone unduly turning their nose up at Lee.

Delroy Lindo is clearly the best thing about this but I'm also a big fan of Terence Blanchard's score (a lot of the comments saying it's ""overscored"" or whatever are missing the point). Became a little frustrated with the very obvious lifts from Treasure of the Sierra Madre (they even say ""we don't need no stinkin badges""!!), but really loved the weird, highly artificial flashback sequences, something a lot of people seem to just be taking at face value and tearing apart as ""amateurish"" as if Lee has no idea what he's doing. Really liked the rapid-fire archive inserts near the beginning of the film and sort of wish that kept up all the way through (but I guess that might not make sense with the direction the film took).",h7ailm
furq2oi,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. Some parts seemed a little Tarantino-esque, I dug that. I went to Vietnam a few months back and fell in love with it, so I got the added effect of travel nostalgia.

It reminded me of that scene in Blackkklansman when they're talking in the hallway and the white cop mentions how its possible a KKK member could become president and David Washington's character says ""no way that would happen"" like wow I wonder what this scene could possibly be talking about.

fuv45cd,"I loved Blackkklansman, but I struggled to finish this one

I actually think Spike should have watched *Stand By Me* before writing this film. He seems to think he needed to add all these artificial action scenes, but it could just have been about the dynamic between these characters on a journey (with the action contained to flashbacks). Finding their friend's remains could have been the emotional climax of the film. 

The historic references felt pretty forced. I expect more deep-cut history from Spike, not reminders that MLK was shot. Yes, we know. 

Some of the editing was just incomprehensible. There is a scene at the beginning of this movie that takes place in a restaurant. I was constantly getting disoriented with who was sitting where.

I did like the look of the 1960's scenes, and I had no problem with the modern actors playing their younger selves. That was a clever touch. I also liked the one musical cue where Marvin Gaye's (I think?) voice was used by itself.

Overall, not terrible, just mediocre and too long.",h7ailm

fvap79n,"I was super excited to see this and meant to watch it when it came out, but didn’t have the time to sit down until tonight. Overall, I’d say it was worth the wait. However, there was some stuff that didn’t quite work, but the strengths outweighed the flaws for me.

Delroy Lindo was a powerhouse in this, and I felt totally electrified and immersed during his scenes. He better at least get a Best Actor nomination, if not a win depending on the competition. The rest of the actors were very good as well; it’s always good to see someone from The Wire, and both Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock Jr were enjoyable to watch in this. I’m not too familiar with Jonathan Majors, but I’m a fan after this (The Last Black Man in San Francisco is on my list to watch). I loved the soundtrack, especially the a cappella version of What’s Going On. The whole minefield sequence was brilliantly directed and almost sickening how tense it was. The real-life footage of deaths, although tough to see, hammered home the horror and brutality of war in a very effective way. The ending, as well as the speeches from MLK, Malcolm X, Angela Davis, and others felt very relevant and prescient given the current climate; both this and BlacKkKlansman two years ago came out at exactly the right moment. 

However, I did feel like the portrayal of the Vietnamese characters was pretty stereotypical and insensitive; it felt off-putting given how well the movie dealt with racial issues  otherwise. I also felt that there was some tonal whiplash later on, as it was kind of jarring to see it basically become an action movie towards the end. 

It’s not Lee’s best work, and I’d rank several of his films above this, but overall I enjoyed it a lot, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it ends up high on my year-end list. It’s in the 8-8.5 range for me.",h7ailm
fvb5lmk,"Some parts worked, but some were off the mark. The Vietnamese enemies arrived with little explanation and were portrayed in a one dimensional stereotypical viewpoint. In contrast, Delroy Lindo was excellent as Paul. I liked the emphasis on Black veterans since it is a subject so rarely written about. Still, I feel some scenes were drawn out longer than needed and not all pieces of the film resonated in the way they seemed to be intended",h7ailm

fuvbqzc,"12 years ago Spike made an awful war movie called “Miracle at St. Anna”. It was a bloated piece that alternated between different times, countries and languages and tried to cram about 3 movies into one. It was a career low and was panned universally. 

This is that failure, compounded.

First of all, every line of dialogue is just a vehicle for the message. Nobody talks like this. For a movie where race is at the forefront, the Vietnamese and French characters are laughable caricatures that speak in political platitudes and seem to only represent the historical injustices of their position in the war. No banter, no characterization outside of Paul’s character. It’s a two and a half hour movie with nobody actually talking like people or individuals. It’s all about as subtle as a sledgehammer. 

Second, the ageing. We have 60-70 year old dudes playing 20 year olds alongside an actual young man. Incredibly jarring. The issue here is where this falls apart, why not set it in the 80’s or 90’s when they are young men closely removed from the war unless the whole point of the movie is to make the contemporary parallel, which is basically the dialogue of the film in a nutshell. It never occurred to these guys to go get buried gold until they were senior citizens? It never occurred to them to do the job as young men when they could actually spend the money? 

They go to return the body of Norman, but their buddy steps on a landmine and they’re perfectly fine leaving him behind. The painfully awkward attempt at a relationship between Paul’s son and the minesweeper, which is forced during a Stockholm syndrome situation, a family meltdown and an increasingly violent and complex failed heist. Scenes and characters go nowhere or end abruptly, particularly in film defining moments. Paul shooting Norman is a film defining moment where Spike spends more time on a VC soldier creeping up than he does resonating on a major plot point. 

It’s just a mess, Spike went for a history lesson, social commentary, the men on a mission movie, a war epic, and a buddy movie all in one. It has it’s moments, and I would even think Delroy Lindo deserves a nomination for his performance, but the movie is every bit as bad as Miracle at St. Anna. Each had high ambitions and the potential for excellence but ended up bloated, preachy and overlong. 

I can’t understand for the life of me the critical reaction on this one. This ain’t it.",h7ailm

That snake biting him with the bad CGI pretty much summed up many scenes...me going ""WTF why is this even in here.  And seriously couldn't get better CGI than this?""

On some level I feel like the movie was this was trying to make fun of movies like this...a group of friends who go on an adventure linked to younger years.  It felt like a 2.5 hour long cliche.   Finding the gold so quickly, the ridiculously stereotyped Vietnamese, everything being foreshadowed in the most obvious way, the cartoonish behavior of practically everyone.

I'm fine with many aspects of the movie that bother people like the flashbacks with the old actors, the editing and camera angles, etc

Comparing this to other amazing war movies is ridiculous.

fv0pz4m,"The dialogue is so generic and clumsy, I didn't hear a single line in the entire movie that sounded like something someone would actually say. Boring, predictable, messy storyline full of unrealistic and empty early '90's testosterone. It explains like the viewer is five. It even regurgitates the classic Hollywood double-cross, which is all but spelled out in the brief introduction of the Frenchman in the first 30 minutes. And as indifferent as I am towards wokeness in art, I gotta say it feels pretty cheap when bookended by straight up caricatured stereotypes of women & Vietnamese soldiers. It just feels like a Spike Lee splatter painting, throwing everything that he knows on the wall weather it sticks or not, but completely shying away from approaching anything more complex than his safe space - specifically blackness and being an aging man. Not to say there isn't plenty of poetry to be had there, it just loses steam when everything else in the universe is empty. And what's with all the Apocalypse Now references? They make no sense and are so weak and unnecessary. I like Spike. But this is a weird messy turd of a film. But I have faith he can knock it out the park next time. Maybe he should try writing his own scripts again.  He went with the formula that nabbed him and Oscar - rewriting pre-existing material with the guy he rewrote The BlackkKlansman with. Personally I'd like to see a new approach.

Also, thjs movie was very well cast. All these guys have alot of chemistry and so do the supporting roles.

Now the story and the setting is the weakest part for me. I think it was interesting at first but it lost alot of traction. It could have been so much better as a reflective experience and the acting was there to support it. I think the story was really a lost opportunity.

It has a good start and decent end but some serious pacing difficulties (purposeful or not) that make it hard for me to see this getting any other nominations. I liked moments of the movie, but taking a step back now a week later, I don't think I liked the whole package. Too many weaknesses and poor choices, be it the casting of the demining team (who should have tried to take the gold rather than met the others by chance); the odd choice of women to play Otis' daughter and ex (ex what? Prostitute? Girlfriend?) since their ages were so wrong I found it distracting; the terrible fight with Jean Reno and Vietnamese gangsters; a beggar in a club... they could have tried a little bit harder on these aspects among many others. Actually the worst thing about the film was its length which felt very padded and unnecessary.

How would you not notice that in casting you dumb fuck? Why was it over 180 minutes long? You were clearly stretching out the run time. This movie draaaaagged. Almost every scene went on noticeably longer than they needed to. Why was no conflict introduced until almost 2 hours in? Why were the mine sweepers in the movie? Obviously they should have been stalking the bloods after they shouted about the gold in the bar, but no they just show up randomly to not help with the mine. It literally their function in the plot and they couldn’t do it! The son was an unlikable loser who needed to fuck off out of the movie. And great ending. Just shove an MLK speech into a movie that has nothing to do with him, that’ll let the audience know this is a socially portentous film, obviously it wasn’t a last minute bullshit tack on.

Terrible terrible film 3/10. Try harder, Spike.

Actually one more thing. The first guy gets all his limbs blown off by a mine. The Swedish guy is missing no limbs and the worst that seems to happen to him is getting some dust on his clothes. And then the grenade doesn’t even do anything. The guy just kept on the ground and they added a sound effect in post.

But damn I wish Spike Lee (I assume he had complete control over the final edit) had done something with the pictures rather than just black and white on a black background. It just looked like someone’s PowerPoint presentation. For me it sucked a lot of the impact of them out by looking kinda amateurish. 
(For the record, I thought the inclusion of the Charlottesville footage in BlackkKlansman was really powerful)

I honestly can’t think of a different way he could have done it without cheapening the message, but it totally felt weird to me.

It was a tonal nightmare. The worst part is I really wanted to like it. The opening scenes were great, but it devolved from there.

But I never felt his strength was action and it feels evident in this film; as many have echoed, Jean Reno's character and the general attitude towards a lot of the Vietnamese characters didn't sit right and felt counterintuitive to a lot of the attitude of the film. The Spaghetti Western-level motivation of gold bars was really the sour point; I had originally figured that the true underlying motive to the Bloods returning to Vietnam was to get closure on Stormin' Norman, but when the film continued as they wanted to keep the gold bars... it felt superfluous as more of the Bloods continued to suffer and lay down their lives for money that seemingly belonged to the Vietnamese people anyway. Many might argue it was Spike Lee's intent to draw parallel to the war itself though, and the film's really only been out for a day, so I'm going to keep an eye out as more critical analysis maybe reveals some of the underlying intentions. 

There were other elements that felt a little clunky too, but ultimately I enjoyed the film.

* Once again this proves that Chadwick Boseman needs to be in more movies. I really loved him in Civil War but his character got pretty bland when it came to his own movie.

* Paul getting bit by a snake in the jungle has to be a biblical reference right? Still trying to work out the purpose of it though, I guess he is doing some evangelism in his death scene.

* Loved how the surviving characters were basically the new Bloods

* Not sure how I felt about the characters recounting history at varioua points throughout the movie, I hope at least that it will be informative to some people.

* The prop for Eddie's dying body looked pretty ridiculous. Norm Lewis is a fantastic musical actor so it was weird to see him in this.

* Spike Lee is clearly not an action director. That first action scene in Nam could have been cut in half and would have been way better.

* Loved the aspect ratio changes, can't think of any other films that have used that part of the medium specifically to communicate time jumps.

* The music could have been better. There were some scenes where I wondered if my tv was playing it wrong cause some of the pieces overstayed their welcome and seemed to clash with the events.",h7ailm

fulqlh4,"My (very long) thoughts in rambling fashion(at least the second part) as I wrote in letterboxd: 

*""I must look like some Patty Hearst heiress who's cast herself as a guilt-ridden bourgeoisie cliché.”* — Yea, you do. Would maybe, just maybe be fine in isolation, but EVERYTHING in the film is like this. Everything. So painfully self-aware that’s impossible to truly engage with the story or latch onto something organic(the Paul character gives us *something* interesting from time to time, but barely). Too woke regarding its history and too consistently conscious about its politics including the characters themselves. The film cuts into real-life footage(some of it predictable of Trump, and not fitting like the chilling inclusion in “BlacKkKlansman”) and photos and different types of expositions so often that one can’t help but wonder if Spike Lee would have been better off making a documentary instead. (Speaking of documentaries, if you want to watch a good one that concerns itself with these times and in a far better fashion than this then go watch “I Am Not Your Negro”.) He’s practically patting himself in the back at this point. 

Most of these complaints are in the first hour(in which he also breaks the 180-degree rule so often for some reason; as jarring as the editing in the first portions of “25th hour” are; it feels like Lee gets a kick of including unconventional techniques for no other reason other than to be rebellious. The double cutting when people are embracing is the only unconventional technique of his that works for me consistently. The dolly shot feels contrived more than anything, as if he can’t make a film without his signature all over it at this point.). After that, the movie finally gets going with its plot, and, surprisingly, is rather quick in how fast it has our characters find their pot of gold. Initially doubtful that it could sustain its story for another hour and 20 minutes, it seems that my doubt was well placed because “Da 5 Bloods” turns into a rather conventional and boring jungle action film. It's especially ill-fitting because it uses so much real life footage to show the atrocities of war and its shocking violence while itself transforms into a typical '80s action movie with senseless and gratuitous violence(and which inherently has an imbalance in terms of perspective). Not to mention that its point that the wars of the past are still being fought today doesn't make much sense; it's true for black people in America, but I can't even begin to understand what Lee means when it comes to USA vs. Vietnam; as if bad blood can be likened with a war being fought...

Was at least initially intrigued when it hinted at the potential of the story being about corruption in the face of money, people turning against each other, not being able to trust your fellow brother, etc. but while there is some of that here, it’s mostly external forces that disrupt our heroes plans. (And while the premise that I just laid out is obviously conventional, when done right it can be as interesting as any other great story. Still would have to be a much shorter story for that to work though.)

Other unconnected ramblings: 

Apocalypse Now poster and Ride of the Valkyries? Seriously? At least he isn’t hiding it.

Not sure why they didn’t just cast younger actors for the flashbacks. They didn’t even bother coloring their white hairs… 
Builds up Norman way too much; makes him into a mythical figure instead of just a good leader. What's wrong with him just being another brother loved and respected enough to be remembered all those years later? And on the mention of remembering, they really didn’t mourn their friend(Eddie) all that much between the time they lost him and their own last moments. Then again the way he went away was so painfully bad(slowly but surely walking backward into an obviously—to the audience—upcoming minefield death) that I don’t even care to care. Not to mention what comes after: them coincidently just running into the French girl and her company, who of course previously mentioned that they disable landmines. (I couldn’t begin to buy her and David’s “chemistry”, which the movie is obviously hinting at, nor do I buy her suddenly being ok with what she and her friends went through, even at the sight of gold. Doesn’t help—or perhaps it’s the main reason—that Mélanie Thierry is mostly horrible in this.)

The “reveal” regarding Paul’s character is so underwhelming compared to the initial thought that springs to mind of him having killed Norm for some reason. But an accident hardly adds much to it except explain his guilt. And his reconciliation scene is so bad with how over the top sappy and sentimental it is with its music, and with him crying “I’m sorry”.  

And, unfortunately, nothing in the final 15-20 minutes redeems it either. The Frenchman not shooting Otis instantly and instead doing a villain monologue is the film stepping even lower into action film cliche territory than I thought was possible for Lee. And the entire epilogue is just not very good. ""Father, I miss you, and I love you so..."" etc. is so painfully awkward and inauthentic. Anything worthwhile from this movie comes from Delroy Lindo’s acting abilities and his acting abilities alone. 

One hundred fifty-five motherfucking minutes. I do not exaggerate when I say that this would be running too long at 2 hours. Get a damn grip Spike. Usually hate people who say this but I cannot even begin to fathom this film's critical acclaim; can’t help but feel that the time in which it is released is certainly not hurting its chances. 3-4/10 for me—just not very good in my opinion.",h7ailm
furhpya,"I’m kind of shocked... from the dry acting to terrible and unnatural dialogue to the worst shooting scenes I’ve ever seen... I almost feel like this movie was made terrible on purpose to degrade black actors but forced in our faces as something we must accept BECAUSE it’s black actors. This is coming from a half black person so nothing to do with race but can’t help but acknowledge how Hollywood works. I cringed soo much watching this. Amazed at the positive responses here. Cut scenes to the past while looking the same age, on a mission to find gold but like it’s a vacation as well, like they aren’t breaking the law or there is no risk. Feels so extremely forced and not one thing pokes out as even a hint of a decent movie. I can keep going but I’m sure I’ll get flack for not liking this judging by the comments already.

Edit: I wanted to turn the movie off so many times but forced myself to finish it. What pisses me off is they use real pictures of prominent figures or events as a way to make this movie “hit harder” but it continues to fail at every turn. This “movie” is beyond bad.

Edit 2: This movie uses the pain those men went through in Vietnam to try to justify this terrible movie like connecting it to those events gives it any credit. This movie left me upset not just for time wasted or what felt like torture to watch but because the attempt to manipulate.",h7ailm

Using old guys to play themselves in flashbacks did not make sense.

All of the actors were too young for their roles.

Overall, I found Spike’s weaving of themes to today to be more effective than in “BlacKkKlansman.” The Film was a cross between “The Treasure of Sierra Madre” & “Apocalypse Now.” Gorgeous cinematography and the set pieces were well-done, as they normally are for Spike. The “Flight of the Valkyries” scene was expertly done, even if you aren’t aware of the reference to “Apocalypse Now.”

The pacing and some themes were a little unevenly distributed, but those are just minor quibbles...’Sheeeeeeeetttt!’ ;-)

Beautiful cinematography and the way the aspect ratio changed with the time period was excellent. Only gripes being that it did feel overtly long and the structure of the film felt messy and confusing at times. Would love to see this one get nominated for some Oscars.

Side note: What was up with Tien? If her and Otis had a fling during the war shouldn’t she be an old woman? Or was this a situation where she “appears young” because that’s how Otis remembers her?",h7ailm

fumvn5g,"I wrote up this review of the film just after watching and I had a lot to say. 

Spike Lee’s latest film ‘Da Five Bloods’ is, as expected, absolutely great! The script is phenomenal and the performances are out of this world, Delroy Lindo’s performance is absolutely breathtaking, heartbreaking and at times it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen on screen before. A truly masterful performance and it’ll be a crime and a complete and utter tragedy if he isn’t at least nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe for his truly astonishing work. Another thing that truly added to this film was the repeatedly changing aspect ratio which added a certain unique style to this already incredibly stylish and unique film. This film is very reminiscent of some old Hollywood movies. You watch this film and sort of know that a lot of this stuff, especially a lot in the second half, would never happen but SHIT is it entertaining and so much fun even if at times it’s utterly brutal in many ways. In my eyes, this film is on definitely on par with Spike’s last film ‘BlackKklansman’ and it’s probably one of his best of the past decade. 

There’s a lot about this film which I really loved but the ending is where sadly I feel the film took a bit of a more than slightly random turn. Now, BlackKklansman’s ending made sense as that film is political and nothing short absolutely powerful to witness and the film’s climax was a large part of that for me but the whole film is truly incredible too, but that ending blows me away every single time, genuine near perfection. Da Five Bloods for sure has a political undertone but this film’s ending seems too similar to the ending of BlackKklansman. That particular ending is incredibly powerful and moved me to tears, the film was truly building up to that, it’s heavily political but that’s the point, it is supposed to be a little in your face about racism and the KKK and the evils that they have committed thus meaning that the ending was completely built up to and really pushed the film to a genuine near masterpiece. As I stated, Da Five Bloods has more of a political *undertone* but yet it still has the same sort of powerful ending as BlackKklansman, it takes building up to make that ending a powerful, possibly tear jerking and heartbreaking one and Da Five Bloods didn’t have that kind of build it. This film was about brotherhood, loyalty, the horrors of the Vietnam war and what it did to the men who fought. Although it had its political moments, I don’t think the ending was built up enough to have its full effect.

So, to sum it all up, Da Five Bloods is quite possibly one of Spike Lee’s best. The performances within this film are utterly astonishing and the story and script are truly amazing and both have been brought to life in truly amazing fashion. Although the ending felt a little out of place, the rest of the film was truly extraordinarily great! Spike Lee still remains one of the best filmmakers in modern times.",h7ailm
fuot6vm,"It was a pretty good movie overall. Spike Lee definitely touched a lot of serious themes that makes you realize how little we have progressed as civilization. The main arc definitely surrounded Paul (Lindo did an excellent performance) his inner/past demons and how he still fights and live with the repercussions of them. 

A slow first act but necessary to set up as blatantly as Lee could the different takes that the trip had on each other. As he mentioned on the movie, it shows how, for some, the war never ended and it’s very much alive today but expressed in many different ways. 

He didn’t shy away from the current political turmoil that surrounds the US and instead showed us how it has separated, and alienated the US not only from the world but from itself. The famous MAGA hat is used as the ultimate symbol of the greed and superiority that makes men turn against each other, even of they’re family, that why the only two characters that wore it were those who had the most rage, thirst for revenge and greed. 

I’m impressed of how Lee adds a lot of complexity to his characters and how they’re not necessarily the good or bad ones of the movie but rather a side effect of a senseless act that impacted everyone, some more than others, and how they all live with it.",h7ailm
fuv2j49,"Just saw the movie. That chick that played the character, ""Tien"" (Le Y Lan) is wayyyy too young to play that role.

His performance suffers from bad writing and I have to wonder how many takes Spike pulled out of the actors because some of the scenes felt like they were forced.

Terrence Blanchard nails another Spike soundtrack and the choice to go isolated vocals on Marvin Gaye was spine tingling.

To me, the movie was good, not great.",h7ailm
funmd1h,"Anyone else notice how noticeably bad the editing is? There were way too many simple shots where a character’s action doesn’t line up with the reverse shot or even if it did the action in the first shot happens and then there’s a delay in the reverse shot. It was really bad in the scene where Paul confronts his vision of Norman and Norman pulls him in for a hug. In the first shot the hug is completed and then it cuts to the reverse shot of Paul and the hug is only halfway completed. This is textbook shit and really stood out for the majority of the movie. The editor has worked on some damn good movies too so it’s not like he was some amateur. 

That being said I really enjoyed the characters and the cinematography. I was kind of so-so on a lot of the cliche plot elements and some of the dialogue. A lot of scenes felt like they should have been cut especially in the first act and near the climax which is sad because there was a good 30-40 minute stretch where the movie really had me.",h7ailm

fuo4468,"TLDR: NETFLIX makes awesome directors lazy as shit. 

I was so damn into the trailer and I like Spike a lot. I really, really do. Do the right thing is one of my favorite movies and even more commercial stuff like inside man is cool as shit too.

But I don't see what people liked about da 5 cruds. It's not a good movie. Totally all over the place, long and not in a good way, trash acting, bad dialogue, not even that good of a story and the basicness of it was surprising for a 2 1/2 hour movie, editing was bad.

The good parts were nothing really besides one actor (It's not Lindo). I've never seen this boring of a Vietnam movie. I was laughing at scenes that I know 100 percent weren't supposed to be funny like the mine scene. Some of the songs were dope like Gaye and the chambers bros. The cinematography was pretty decent QED I liked some of the aspect ratio changes for at least a scope of time. 

Aside from Spike, I'm a fan of all of these actors as well and it just seemed like they didn't know what the fuck to do half the time with the dialogue. The boat scene with the panic attack was terrible. Some of the ADR in that scene was atrocious. In the same vein as ADR, the sound editing and design was ass.

I'm a simple critic, pretty much I'm either ""hey I liked it"" or ""eh, not so much."" Definitely the latter here, this would have felt like a slog if viewed in the theater.

 Im just wondering though, while the cast was great, I’d love to know what others think about the ages of the main cast (the 4) and if the actors were believable in a role that the characters would have to be around 70 if they served in Vietnam at 18-20 years old.

But taking this story seriously is almost laughable because i couldn’t considering that they were having a firefight with Jean Reno and his evil Vietnamese gang. Overall still liked it but would’ve liked it better if the action was toned down or if the silliness was toned up but you can’t have both.",h7ailm
fur85ch,"i'm actually really annoyed at how bad this movie is because i was really looking forward to it. the entire movie has this really cheap feeling to it. the editing is all over the place. the action scenes look really clumsy and poorly directed. could netflix seriously not spring some cash for decent VFX? the blood and muzzle flashes looked like some effects you could download 10 years ago. the acting from pretty much everyone except delroy lindo and jonathan majors was bad. i also don't get why people say delroy lindo deserves an oscar for this. he overacted a little too much for me but i guess he was still better than the rest of the cast. 

the script is just beyond lazy and incompetent. random stuff just happens to move the plot along, the bad guys are basically stormtroopers and the characters act completely stupid and are extremely two dimensional as well. how can i spend two and a half hours watching and this movie doesn't manage to make me care about any of the characters? it even takes an hour for the thing to finally get going and i still know almost nothing about these guys that makes me feel invested in the story.

it was really convenient how david goes to take a shit and just happens to find a gold bar by digging a tiny hole. what even was the point of that? why couldn't they just find the gold after some time searching with their metal detector instead of randomly finding it like its a movie for kids?

they witness three people stepping on mines, two of them being blown to pieces but they still all run off into the jungle without the slightest care. maybe you could tell the people who disarm these landmines for a job to check for mines just to be safe? nah, its fine because the plot armour protects us for now!

also really convenient how david mentions that he doesn't want a gun because he probably wouldn't hit anything but then perfectly headshots jean reno from a decent distance. not to mention that it was really obvious what would happen. i've lost count at how often i have seen the [conveniently timed attack from behind](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyTimedAttackFromBehind). except this time it was from the front because jean reno's character is blind as fuck?

another thing that really annoyed me were the random references to popular vietnam war movies. the apocalypse now poster in the bar, ride of the valkyries playing while they were on the boat and paul getting shot and flailing his body around like willem dafoe in platoon stood out to me, not sure if i missed any others. what was the point of these references? were they supposed to pay tribute to these movies or did they want to poke fun at them? they just felt irritating and forced to me.

what a frustrating movie. even more so because clearly spike lee's intentions and his message are great but the execution is just absolutely terrible. i really hoped he was going to deliver another good movie again after blackkklansman but this is not it.",h7ailm
furwced,"The movie would have almost made sense if it was based of a true story or something. But acting was awful, dialogue was even worse.

I enjoyed the first half, particularly having spent a lot of time myself in Vietnam and married to a Vietnamese woman from Saigon. Loved the Heart of Darkness posters (great brewery) and Apocalypse Now scene ( where are the working girls with the fruit plates though?) The contrast of Vietnamese and Black struggles from that time under the boot of white American opression was interesting. I was enjoying it. But something didn't seem right starting from when the half cast GI daughter was introduced and then glossed over, and the jumping around and confusion really escalates in the second half of the film.

They travel far and wide to coordinates in the middle of the jungle, meander into a mined zone where people from their night out in town just happen to be strolling by ? And this is when the parade of random characters begins, and existing characters go off the rails. It got so bad I was actually enjoying watching the characters dropping like flies. Beautiful scenery but a total nonsensical story line, poor character development, and a script in complete dissaray. America saved France in World War II, great, and no one saved the actors from having to work with this shambles of a script. And no Spike, you don't get to throw in a last minute message about common sacrifice to paper over the random mish mash of unbelievable and chaotic scenes, undeveloped emotional characters that you don't give me a reason to care about other than brotherhood.

Spike Lee is just too angry. I say this from brother to brother.. CHILL.  


I knew it when he started getting angry when Quentin released Django. He was clearly just mad he didn't come up with the idea.  


I liked the action and drama in this movie but he lays it on way too heavy.  


It was a bit *too heavy, to the point of patronising*  


Like how two people will be in conversation and one will say ""The white man ruining everything in fact the first black man to do x was so and so  **BIG PICTURE OF HISTORICAL FIGURE FLASHES ON THE SCREEN AND STAYS THERE FOR SECONDS, BREAKING IMMERSION.**  


The first time it happened I was like WTF?? Maybe it's an intro. But it happened like 2 more times and I was just like Ok, Spike Lees got dementia, this isn't how you make a movie that isn't a documentary. He just couldn't help himself, he had to feel he's force feeding people black greatness and instead made it patronising.  


He didn't need to throw pictures on the screen, half the historicial figures I already knew, even just mentioning the name is passing makes me go ""Oh, I want to google that guy"" but Spike really over did it.  


I feel Spike Lee did well with ""Malcolm X"" that was a good one, this one is just a bum movie with the racial narrative clumsily done at the expense of a good story , like his other bum movie ""Miracle at St. Anna"".  


He could portray genuine serious racism and issues of prejudice, so he makes the  Army officer a souther hick so racist he decides to fire artillery on his own soldiers... Yeah, how can anyone take that seriously, he can't control his anger and turn it into legitimate story telling sometimes, he just gets childish or rams it down your throat.",h7ailm
fuqa64e,"Spike Lee simply isn’t a very good director. Black Klansman was solid, but the majority of his filmography especially the last 20 years is garbage.

This was kind of frustrating because there was a lot to like but at the same time some things just didn't work. The present day scenes were mostly good and I loved the four leads, that minefield scene was great. 

But I didn't like the flashback scenes at all. They looked very 'amateurish' or cheap, like an 80's b-action movie. I don't know, maybe that was on purpose but it just didn't work for me. Also the movie dragged a little, did it really have to be 2h 30min? 

Spike Lee has been a film-make for FORTY YEARS, he still doesn't have words like ""editing,"" and ""subtlety."" in his vocabulary. He'd be thrown out of film-school otherwise with a joke like this, but lo and behold, he gets a 91 on rottentomatoes by experts who would otherwise know better.",h7ailm

fup0216,"What a film. Spike uses the war to examine racism, the black experience as well as PTSD and the effect on the Vietnamese people. It's unique and something which hasn't been done in this way before. I'd like to call it a post war film

I love how this film crosses many genres. What begins as a reunion comedy shifts into a post war -drama to a heist adventure. The second half is a lot heavier than the first half but still brilliant. Delroy Lindo is brilliant and Chadwick's role as their leader is beautifully portrayed. He is their malcolm and Martin. Even Paul's character who seems an ignorant trump supporter has depth to him. Haunted by his demons, we see the effect it's had on his life after the war and his son. His anger at the failure to improve the black experience led him to voting trump. 

A brilliant complex film which brings some laughs as well as a deep look into racism, the impact of the Vietnam war, as well as recognising black excellence. It also shows how money leads to greed and how the bloods become paranoid thinking they will be killed. I liked Eddie's character. He fought for black liberation til the end. Didn't care about his debts

9.5/10. It does run a little long but it never feels like it drags. A masterpiece of spike Lee's. A movie for generations to come",h7ailm
fuqrnrv,"This movie was really bad, the message is phenomenal and I thought the first 25 minutes of the movie was one of the best all year.

fumwa5o,"I really really liked this one. I see how it’s not for everyone, and it’s flawed. However, I love seeing the perspective of black soldiers from Vietnam. I thought the casting and performances were great. 

To me I’d take this over a war movie like 1917 that is much more “thrilling” and “entertaining” but lacks any real substance  (just my opinion). I feel like there is a lot more to walk away with especially with the current events going on.

As a high school social studies teacher it’s cool seeing clips that I show in class in this movie, and I wonder if any of my former students will watch this and remember them. I will definitely be watching this one again soon.",h7ailm

funwnld,"I liked it overall.  I found it uneven in spots.

The opening montage with Ali talking over Marvin Gaye was well done.

Club Apocalypse Now was a cool nod.

Delroy was outstanding.  The scenes where they found Norman’s remains and where Norman forgave Paul were extremely moving.

The blood spatter and muzzle flash effects appeared cheap and then it appears a lot of money was spent on a shocking effect from a land mine which was more gruesome than something out of the Saw franchise.  It was so bad it really took me out of the movie and felt uneccesary. 


The math had major issues around ages.  One Blood meets what is supposed to be an old flame when there is no way the woman is older than 50 but they were “in country” at least 48 years ago.

Even stranger is how it’s revealed it’s their daughter he meets minutes later but clearly we are looking at a beautiful 30 something year old woman when in actuality she would be close to 50.

A reviewer made a great point that setting the film in the 80’s would have made more sense and allowed the leads to play themselves in the flashbacks.  I found the guys in their 60’s slightly jarring but it was not a major issue.",h7ailm
funya62,"I liked it quite a bit. 

I loved the juxtaposition of using 'Ride of the Valkyries' for just a slow riverboat ride when it was also famously used in 'Apocalypse Now', another Vietnam War movie.
I liked David's swearing of the oath against the president at the bar.
I liked most of the performances, but especially Delroy Lindo as Paul.
I was slightly taken aback by how many of them actually make it through the movie. I get it, but just, damn. 
One thing that I didn't like was the quick double-take edits when people hugged. I think it happened three or so times and it just was really jarring.  You see two people go in for a hug and then the next really quick cut/edit is a different angle going in for the hug again. I just don't get that choice but would be happy to hear why people thought it worked.",h7ailm
furfbfd,"> “The American war turned Vietnamese families against Vietnamese families”

As a Vietnamese American that grew up with mainly South Vietnamese and American influence, that line hit me so hard. It took years until my third visit back to Vietnam in 2013 as a college kid to understand both sides of the war, and while Vietnam itself isn’t perfect, families are reunited and the country is whole.

This movie was so good too. There was so much that resonated with my own personal life growing up in mainly black and brown neighborhoods and understanding the drive of the main cast and Spike’s message.",h7ailm
furlvft,"It was good. Not terrible, not a masterpiece...just good. 

The bad - You can always tell when Netflix gives a director too much control, and with Spike Lee that's bound to have a big impact. There was a disjointed, unfocused feel to a lot of the movie - some themes that came up but didn't feel fully fleshed out. There were also some odd graphic decisions - the de-aged photographs were horrendous; you would think they could do better than the 12 year old playing with photoshop look.

The good - All that said, I really enjoyed the main storyline, the brief tense moments of action, and most of the acting. And while the beginning of the movie was a bit slow, the pace did pick up and for quite a long film I thought it flew by in the second half. I felt the themes that were presented were all relevant and important, even if some were less fleshed out than others. Definitely worth a watch, despite its flaws.",h7ailm

When that French guy got blown up he was still on the road. In all the years since the war, nobody walked over that part of the road or saw the mine. Just one of the many action moments that make no sense in this film.

furwiy5,"Once I saw Lester Freamon and Clay Davis in the lobby of the hotel, I was hoping for that patented Shieeeeeeeeet. Glad Spike Lee delivered.

Edit: Just finished it. I'd give it a 4/10. Spike's message is certainly commendable, but the movie itself was too predictable and too generic. I think this was a major step down from BlacKkKlansman for Spike which is a real shame. The score didn't do anything for the film. The bad guys were some of the most cookie cutter villains I've seen in a while. It seemed like everyone had a bottomless magazine (something that usually doesn't bother me in action movies, but really stood out here.) I saw the friendly fire bit coming from a mile away. The Vietnamese and French characters were so stereotypical that I'm surprised there hasn't been more of an uproar over how ridiculous they were. 

The performances and chemistry from the core four guys were the only redeemable aspects of the film to me. Gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with this one and kind of wish I had those two and a half hours back.",h7ailm

When that one guy, whatever the fuck was his name, stepped on the landmine and blew up he looked so fake, i laughed out loud when the blood squirted out of his blown up arms. The characters were garbage. Ok film from Tyler Perry Lee.",h7ailm

Kind of funny how they just kept everyone old looking in the flashbacks. They didn't even try to color out the grey hair or anything. I wonder if that's some kind of stylistic choice, or if they were just like ""eh, who cares, everyone gets that this is a flashback"" kinda thing.

Some odd script moments, like stealing Quentin Tarantino's ""pot to piss in, window to throw it out of"" line, or when the mayor from The Wire did the longest ""sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet"" ever.

I did miss some powerful moments due to some irl shit (I talk about what I mean in the next paragraph) but it still works extremely well and like almost every Lee film I've seen so far, I teared up at the end. I did think the action in this film was bad (the Vietnam fight towards the start was almost incomprehensible to me) but thankfully there were really only two big action moments. 7/10, maybe an 8. 

I had a really bad experience watching this at home though. I'm back home with my parents due to COVID and was watching this on my TV and my dad (he's an Indian immigrant btw) went on a really racist rant about Black people. I was half-way through the movie and completely destroyed my mood. I know that racism is a huge thing in major parts of Asia (and a lot of children of Asian immigrants have to deal with that) but experiencing that irl ruined my mood and I lost focus for about 30 minutes of the movie (like during Eddie's death). Why are Asians so racist?

Spike Lee is back folks. I loved BKKKM, and this is another home run. Its intense and has a powerful message. Great acting from Delroy Lindo.

It isn't perfect though. It is long, and tends to drag. The gold being easy to dig up - after decades- not something i really buy. I also did not need Lindo to be an outright Trump/MAGAtard- i understand it, but the message and character was already so strong without it

If you look at the film as an allegory... I think it makes more sense



MAGA black dude, is a ""got mine"" fuck brotherhood.  I don't care about my kids future.  I'll vote for my own interests to get better and not worry about the next generation. Willing to say the Asian version of the ""n-word""  He also goes it alone which means he wont go ""far."" 

They arrive and care less about their friends remains than they do about gold. - this could be emblematic of African Americans only caring about showy wealth and gold than they are about people who died before them. 

The African Americans who are willing to live more cohesively with other races/people are able to move forward and lift themselves out of turmoil but they must be willing to share the progress.

This could have just been kind of important but while we're in the middle of protests, it hit harder than a motherfucker. every one of our main four characters felt real. my dad is Paul to a tee and all his navy guys are everyone you've seen here. 

The ""history lesson"" aspect of the film, where it talks about various black people and their successes didn't feel hamfisted to me. Considering A: this is how all of these characters feel about those figures and B: we've seen movie after movie and show after show of every white man and woman (sometimes even made up ones) but nothing on some of the people mentioned. The scene where the son steps on the mine and the dad is talking about Edwin Moses felt real to me. The dad was calming the son and, inadvertently, teaching most of us about a man who was the best at something who we never heard of.

This isn't Lee's best movie by a mile, but it is still a good movie.",h7ailm

I really liked this one. A mix Treasure of the Sierra Madre (We don't need no stinking badges) and Three Kings. It's brilliant that when a character talks about a violent event, you see flashes of the real photographs. It hits you hard that even if this is a fictional story, the real events to play heavy into the character's psyche and motivation. I especially love how the aspect ratio changes based on the time period they're in and even the Phone footage has this weird phone logo on the side.

But it feels like he's trying to get it all IN and sometimes it feels like a lot.

fusgmoo,"This movie sucks. CGI looks so fake, the storyline is dumb, the acting is subpar, and the propaganda is not any different to Chinese movies. It's just BLM shoved down to viewer's throat ( or retina I should say ? ).

It's on the same level as Rambo, actually it could be better if it stayed that way like Sharknado then people wouldn't take it seriously, but all this propaganda is just way too much, like a guy who's trying to be comfortable in someone else's suit. So cringy.

All of these concepts some how were fused together in the context of Vietnam War, where I have the feeling the guy just read some random history textbooks and try to be 'precise' about it ? C'mon, a French character in Vietnam ? It's like having the main antagonist of the wolf of wall street casted by a Native American for historical correctness, just because the director just read a book about Columbus. It's just irrelevant and doesn't make any sense at all.

Also the act where the DRVN broadcaster started airing news about Luther King by lighting a smoke ( which is completely wrong because back then Vietnamese women didn't smoke, especially in that higher positions due to the social standard, irl Hanoi Hannah wasn't a smoker either, but I guess Hollywood wants to make it 'cool' ), and then they all suddenly decided to standup against white supremacy is just so brain dead. Like watching a kid TV show.

Not to mention that Jean Reno somehow managed to form a private army in a country where no one is allowed to possess arms ( I know it's hard to imagine ). But this is okay, they need to sell the movie, and no one wants facts, they like a more american approach where everyone has the freedom to shoot each other whenever they want like in the wild wild west. Or in school.

This movie was trying to be something it wasn't, trying to serve what their audiences want to see even if it means they need to create a fake bubble of many wrong details and irrelevant things to satisfy those fantasies.

TLDR: This movie is pizza with bubble tea and sushi toppings. If you watched 'The naked director' on Netflix, remember the episode when they went to Hawaii to film an 'industry revolutionary' movie, and they tried so hard to get some big names for the 'action movie' ? This is the equivalent of that movie, everything considered.

fupt3m9,"Da 5 Bloods is 2020’s Best Picture. I fucking loved this movie and all it stood for and addressed that Vietnam War films tend to.

Most of you in the comments, yall are clearly not students of history beyond fanboyness. Let me educate you on African American Vietnam Veterans and the Veterans it does not mention, but had very similar experiences, frustrations, & difficulties: People of Color. Despite systemic racism, segregation, prejudice, & even going all the way back t the Revolutionary War, African people have fought in the militaries of the United States of America for the United States of America. Bled, died, were basically used to build the country - first slavery, then Jim Crow laws forcing them in similar jobs & social standing, later now creating the prison system and heavy policing to keep Black people in America from getting to a higher economic standing as a majority. But what happened when African Americans grew as a middle class? Well, whites would go and destroy their neighborhoods and kill and steal the wealth these African Americans aqcuired or started race wars that led to massive riots (periodically even starting in the 1920s you see a pattern of riots by African Americans in near every decade up to now and an extreme American Gov. response to it with barbaric violence).

Why do I mention all of this? Because knowing and understanding the real world helps you understand this movie. Blakc GIs despite the paradox of this patriotism would serve anyway. Although generally they would be drafted against their will and had no say in the matter. This was especially true of the Vietnam war which saw Black Americans as well as Hispanic and Asian Americans be drafted and have no say in the matter. Unlike whites who could easily dodge the draft without fear, POC had no say. They were lower economically and used by the US Militaries in Vietnam to do the most dangerous work. White units would stay behind and get the glory of the media, even when the media declared the war immoral who were the Vietnam Veterans that were glorified in Conservative films, TV, and popular culture? White Americans. Im not saying PTSD didnt have an affect on whites or that they didnt also experience trauma, but it was shallow in comparison to Black GIs of Vietnam who didnt recieve the same heroism or sympathy upon returning despite a high number of Black soldiers dying or being used by their militaries as canon fodder. Not only that but the sad reality was there was a genuine fear of being killed by your own White officers - a war crime yes, but something that would still be done and reported as “MIA, killed by Viet-Kong”. My own uncle (God may he rest in peace) said this as much when he was there.

But what was the worst offense? That the fact many Black GIs of the Vietnam War to this day in 2020 havent received the support or acknowledgement of their PTSD, illnesses gained from US chemical weapons, and other abuses. Many having not received a cent in benefits. This is why watching Vietnam War films that gained cultural popularity or films that glorified white men of that war, these are psychotic films about the wrong men. These white soldiers arent the true victims / heroes of the Vietnam War. Its African American GIs who were forced to sacrifice way more than whites and still havent been given their due rewards.

Thats why as a student of history, as a man who was raised alongside the black community, that I looooved Da 5 Bloods. Well, aside from Spike Lee’s direction and filmmaking techniques that I know are gonna go over peoples heads. But if Quinten Tarantino did the same thing yall mother fuckers would be praising his white ass for it. I didnt even get into the excellent performances which were solid all around. Most will say rightfully that Delroy Lindo deserves the Best Lead Actor Award and I wholeheartedly agree. And while hes a Postumous character, Chadwick Boseman also deserves Best Supporting Actor. 

This is a great movie. But if yall didnt understand it - or, lets be real, are super white - maybe study history. Talk to real African Americans IN PERSON. Speak to Black Veterans. I also neglected to mention that Da 5 Bloods really earns points from me for not portraying Da 5 Bloods as all the same viewpoints politically. Delroy Lindo as Paul is the best character but hes also a Trump supporter. Eddie is a wealthier Black Man who lived a life of luxury. Melvin is the jokester and kind of everyman. Otis is the most okay of the group but also struggling with trusting his Vietnamese love and wanting to support her. Talk to real Black Veterans and listen and learn from what they tell you about the war and why even now that its long over it has unfortunately lasting scars - psychological and otherwise.",h7ailm

The fact that this movie has been worked on for the last year or two and just so happened to come out NOW is so insane for many reasons but I imagine spike lee himself has to be pretty conflicted. Obviously the film is going to be a huge hit and watched by everyone that cares about the current BLM movement but it has to suck for someone that has done his best as a filmmaker for 40 years to shed light and bring respect to black causes and figures to have his movie be such a success because America is as broken as ever when it comes to being black here.",h7ailm

fv1f7ue,"The part that irked me most about this movie was the My Lai bit. Earlier they mention that the gold was meant for a Vietnamese tribe to fight against the Communists. Later, it seems to be implied that the Vietnamese who try to take the gold from the Bloods belong to that tribe and are trying to reclaim the gold that was meant for them. Then they get into this slideshow about My Lai and linger on a dead baby, I guess trying to say something about how the Vietnamese have suffered from brutality just like black people?

Then all of the sudden those same Vietnamese get brutally shot and stabbed and later killed by the dozens because gooks bad. The Vietnamese never actually kill any of the Bloods, either in the present or past: Norm gets killed by Paul, Eddie steps on a mine, and Melvin suicides on a grenade thrown by a French man (which he totally did not need to dive on anyway)

The message about distributing the money for the good of the people keeps going back and forth in this movie, but I guess Spike Lee is trying to say the ends justify the means as long as his people benefit?",h7ailm
fus7f2m,"Yeah, American filmmakers have a weird relationship with their wars. For example, I don't think a German movie about World War 2 would be the same as an American movie about Vietnam. There's a lack of acceptance among Americans in general of the crimes their country has committed/is committing. Spike is better about it than most, for obvious reasons, but he still falls into that trap of fundamentally valorizing the troops because they were Americans.",h7ailm
fus39wz,"I kind of disagree with this point. The movie did a good job of humanizing different the Vietnamese who would later die. First the lead henchman, after finding out his brother was killed in the skirmish brings his anger to a very real level, making his killing of Paul  and the conversation before, that much more meaningful. 

 Second, in the flashback where they ambush the Vietnamese squad, the choice to subtitle their conversation about ones girlfriend back home, really drives home the point that despite being on different sides of the war, everyone involved was a human with a life outside of the fighting. Unfortunately, because they, as well as the henchmen, are on different sides our protagonists must kill them to make it out. 

This theme is introduced in the bar where the former Vietcong buy the Bloods a drink. They could get along outside of the fight, but when they are in the think of it, it's kill or be killed.",h7ailm
fursqgl,"I never got that feeling. Towards the end one character even says once you've been in war, reality is just degrees of it, or something like that, and that's what I felt watching it.

fvigjyz,"I completely agree. The movie confronts a war that was morally problematic, but then reduces the Vietnamese characters into villainous caricatures. U.S. involvement in Vietnam was unnecessary and significantly increased casualties, yet this movie brings it back to an “us vs. them” narrative.

futi2sd,"Let’s hear from an American living in Vietnam.

From Matt Steinglass, journalist with The Economist who lived in Vietnam for years:

Dear Vietnamese friends, 

The new Spike Lee movie is a steaming pile of crap. It seems to me that it is an offensively colonialist steaming pile of crap that treats its Vietnamese characters as ludicrously out-of-date cliches: the discriminated Vietnamese daughter of an African-American serviceman; the poor farmer for some reason desperately trying to sell his chicken to an American at the floating market; the beggar child yelling “GI, GI” (who has said that in 50 years?). It cavalierly dismisses the sovereignty of the Vietnamese state, absurdly imaging that Vietnam would invite American war vets to just march into the jungle unaccompanied to locate an MIA serviceman’s remains. It treats Vietnam as an insignificant backdrop to an American story, just as colonialist narratives always have. But I am not Vietnamese, so I may be getting this all wrong. Would anyone care to offer their interpretations? I found the film almost unwatchable but you probably only need to see the first 45 and last 15 minutes to get the gist.",h7ailm
fusjhym,"Yeah, even as someone who’s never been to Vietnam, I could tell that it was a stereotypical and bullshit portrayal of a country.",h7ailm
furqv9u,"Agreed that the firecracker and floating market scenes were forced. They didn't feel realistic or natural. However, this is the view of the director Spike Lee. I don't think you should take it as proof that Americans in general haven't moved on.",h7ailm
fuvnttn,"The “bad guys” were hired by Jean Reno to follow the Bloods and steal the gold after they retrieved it. They weren’t just randomly walking through the jungle with rifles. 
The disabled kid I assumed stepped on a landmine. 
All the other stuff you mentioned about the context and the state of modern Vietnam I couldn’t know so I defer to your more informed point of view.",h7ailm
fux5n3p,"I have a few good friends from Vietnam I went to college with and I knew just from what they've told me about Vietnam that the depiction of the country was bullshit and based off of stereotypes, which is interesting coming from a movie with themes about racism. I thought it would have the bloods reconcile with the vietnamese because they've both been fucked over by America, but instead it just enforces stereotypes Americans have about Vietnam and really hurt the themes this movie was trying to establish. Hell they even joke about how unrealistic Rambo is, but then the movie becomes Rambo esque in its forced action and depictions of Vietnamese people.",h7ailm
fuvtevs,"I've only spent a couple of weeks in Vietnam so what the hell do I know, but yeah, this film's depiction of the country really didn't sit well with me. It's the most developed country in the region and a dynamic economy, and they portrayed parts of it as some kind of lawless hellhole. Especially since Lee used archival footage and photos of the slaughter of the country, that gives you some responsibility, you'd think he'd make an effort to do right by the people living there today, you can't have it both ways. It wouldn't surprise me that he had never even visited the country until filming there. It's best to take just the film as pulpy shlock with some attempts at social commentary and it does manage to entertain. But it is definitely ironic that Lee wants to open people's minds to the black experience and wants the audience to think beyond stereotypes, while doing the same bullshit to the Vietnamese.",h7ailm

Think about the flash back scenes. They all see themselves in the past as their current selves. I think that's part of what plays in on the theme. 

Paul is even called an ignorant American regarding his understanding of history twice in the film. I feel that was the whole point.

I was wondering how he knew they were GI, and I was guessing from the age and also the fact that one guy had a hat that said Vietnam veteran on it. 

I didn’t know the cheers scene has been so overdone in Vietnam either. I don’t recall any American films doing that, but then again I’m not a huge film buff.",h7ailm

fuxjj4x,">We moved on from this phase long ago and do not bear hatred towards Americans.

That's good to know, but honestly a bit surprising.  I realize my anecdote comes from Laos and not Vietnam, but I figured it would be worse in Vietnam, not better...

Anyway, I have a coworker who is Laotian, he moved to the US as a teenager because he had an uncle who worked with US intelligence, they figured it was safer for him and his siblings to have amnesty in the US when America pulled out of Vietnam.


And I agree with you on this film, I think it was a bad film, especially coming from Spike Lee who is otherwise and excellent director.
Apparently when he goes back, his (now after all these years) American accent causes him to catch a lot of shit in Laos whenever he travels back home.  I feel bad for him, like he's caught between two worlds.",h7ailm

I think the kid was disabled though because of the still active mines. I didn't make that connection until the end with the donation to the LAMB mine removal foundation. 

I thought the guy flipped out at the floating market because Paul called him a ""gook"", and so the chicken seller put two and two together with the guy's age, and concluded they were GI. I don't know why he was so pushy to begin with, but I live in the suburbs. I thought he was sort of justified in flipping out at Paul though. You can't go to someone else's country and call them derogatory names. 

Those people in the jungle were clearly not government. I'm not sure how you got that. They were probably just hired criminals, hired by the French guy.

Me and my girlfriend sat down to watch, thinking it's a drama comedy film. I missed Spike Lee's name.

Now, my girl friend isn't a huge film buff to say the least.

But I am.

So pretty soon into the movie she said, ""this film is pretty weird.""

I thought so as well, but for different reasons.

First of all Delroy Lindo was just breathtaking, and the atmosphere he brought into the film was palpable.

I checked my phone and saw the director's name and told my girl friend hold on bitch, this ain't no comedy.

Two and a half hours later, she took it like a champ and sat through the whole thing. I loved every minute and I think there are so many metaphors and comparisons, which I probably missed or misinterpreted as I'm not American.

There were also a lot of random scenes that felt out of place or completely unnecessary to the story. It would have served its purpose a lot better if they trimmed about 20 minutes or so off and fixed a lot of the bad editing in certain scenes.

>We are now having a very innocent little chat. Let's suppose that there is a bomb underneath this table between us. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, ""Boom!"" There is an explosion. The public is surprised, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene, of no special consequence. Now, let us take a suspense situation. The bomb is underneath the table and the public knows it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is aware the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions, the same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene. The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ""You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. There is a bomb beneath you and it is about to explode!"" 

>In the first case we have given the public fifteen seconds of surprise at the moment of the explosion. In the second we have provided them with fifteen minutes of suspense.

You killed ours brothers and fathers!"" the appropriate response is ""yeah we got fucking forced into this shit war, we're all getting fucked"" not ""shit happened on both sides"" and then the vietnamese gets turned into some others to kill en masse for cheap thrills. That part sucked. I dunno if americans just have a different perspective but it's insane to witness as a non-american. Americans went to Vietnam and killed hundreds of thousands, you don't get to say ""shit happened on both sides"" when talking to someone who lost people trying to fight outside invaders.

And then he throws in this random ass stereotypical French villain (who carries a Luger for some reason) like this is the 80s or something. Its like Spike rewatched Raiders of the Lost Ark and realized Belloq is kinda a cool character so he decided to throw some devious Frenchman in there as the villain.",h7ailm

He was a guy wracked with guilt and insecurity, unable to express himself emotionally. He had crippling PTSD and was extremely paranoid and distrustful of anyone he perceived to be coming after what was rightfully his (mainly the government and other minorities groups). He felt disenfranchised/ignored by the the southern democrats and establishment republicans who dominated American politics in the 60s and 70s. Weirdly I think the character was somewhat inspired by Kanye West, with his manic energy and bipolar political rants.

I don’t know any black Trump supporters, but I know a lot of Latino ones, and their reasons for liking him definitely line up with Paul’s.",h7ailm

The two things I couldn’t get over were the terrible music cues, which completely messed up the impact of certain scenes, and didn’t allow others to breath; and the pacing itself. Certain parts definitely made sense for odd pacing or quirky beats, but the beats from scene to scene were way too shaky. Other that that, I really enjoyed the movie.",h7ailm

The music seemed very much like “this could be in any other movie” and the only noticeable effect any music had on the scene was when they were either singing together, dancing together in the club at the start, or when there was haunting acapella of Marvin singing over images of the Temple. Maybe they had the other music so bland to contrast it more with Marvin’s brilliance?",h7ailm

But the notion that VN people still hung to the war is actually weird, esp the whole rant about My Lai is super weird. I don't think anyone but the strictest history buff would know the name Calley tbh.

fuv0pb9,Any gang of hired armed thugs would be stereotypical. Spike Lee added many scenes showing the pain that was inflicted towards other people besides the Americans. The gold was meant for South East Asians and their alliance in the war. The “bloods” mow down VC soldiers while they are talking about their love lives. The leader of the gang discusses the My Lai massacre and his relation to it. Other than that as a Vietnamese American I was convinced by those characters as well as the boat sellers and pan handlers. The only character that failed was Thien as her acting was atrocious.,h7ailm

My personal gripes with the movie (and spike Lee as a whole) is that his movies have a lot of predictable moments and sometimes can be a bit too cheesy/cliche.

Can you be more specific? I've seen this comment a lot, but no one has explained it. On a technical level, the editing was great.

It's also consistent with the entire canon of Vietnam films. So much familiar imagery repurposed for the context of the film.

IMO Spike deliberately emphasized symbolism and foreshadowing. I mean they were literally chasing down a pot of gold in the middle of the jungle. It's hard to believe he was going for subtlety or looking to surprise the audience. Especially with the landmines, he basically shoves it in the viewers face. It is consistent with the overarching theme that war never left Vietnam.

Weirdly, though, I was still emotionally invested in the film despite being very aware of how sloppy and melodramatic much of it was and I cried a few times. My heart broke for Paul’s son and I found the depiction of PTSD, trauma and a broken father/son relationship very moving.

fun7r7q,"I think it was a downright good movie, but Spike seems like he's constantly fighting the overwhelming urge to stop the movie and just spend two hours doing a direct call for black political action. So the tone of the movie is kind of rocky in that regard. 

If it was just ""City Slickers but with old black Vietnam Veterans,"" it would have been a very solid movie. The interplay between the characters was great, the Vietnam environment was great, and the things like snake attacks and bad CGI shootouts would not have been an issue.

Because it was trying to be more than ""City Slickers"" and have all this serious messaging about black history and modern politics, scenes with snake attacks and convenient landmines and bad CGI shootouts become more jarring. A lot of movies lately have tried to do this ""both stupid and serious"" thing lately, like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Jo Jo Rabbit. And I think all these movies end up landing weirdly with audiences.",h7ailm

That's hilariously accurate.  This movie had an incredible amount of highs and lows that just didn't mix.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but there were some terrible scenes.  A lot of it was normal Spike Lee, but some of it was just too much.  It kind of gave me that *Spring Breakers* feel where I know what they were trying to do, making purposely bad or a parody/satire of sorts.   But I don't know if that's what they were going for here...which would just make it bad.

You're 100% right about the timing and reviews.  I'm sure this will get a ton of unearned praise right now but ultimately not be memorable.   I'd give this a 5/10 I guess.  I may have turned it off if it wasn't for Lester and Clay, but I was curious enough to see how it ended.",h7ailm

The small scope of the movie with this long of a run time let’s it go deep into these characters and the story’s themes. I found the performances to be pretty great overall and I was down for the ride. So as long as you are along with it, then the many thoughts it’s bringing together actually work and feel like they are given time to breathe while building upon each other for a more epic feeling. And I agree with you, there is power in the movie for sure, which I think stems from the multitude of well built and felt emotions woven into the otherwise simple story.

The maga hat is passed around during the final scenes of the movie. When Paul is killed by the Vietnamese people, the leader of the group takes the hat an places it on his head. 

Afterwards and before the final showdown, the hat is passed to the the French guy, who is the leader. In the battle the Vietnamese are killed first. 

I thought this was demonstration how people are devided by power. The hat is using people until they are killed kinda thing. 

Also notice when Paul was hallucinating his intervention with Norman, the hat is backwards on his head. As though it has no power anymore because Paul has confronted his own guilt and forgiven himself.

There’s no dramatic tension in the scene because we know the outcome and yet it drags on and on.

fum02ki,"EDIT: Lol the comments and downvotes. Fuck you I won't do what you tell me, left-wing cuntists.

People have been pointing this out for decades about these movies. They get shot down as racists or misogynists every single time. The same held true for Ghostbusters, for example.

It's the marketing for the film that gives it away. If it centers around their skin color/gender (and our modern day patron saints of victimhood place their combination somewhere at the bottom of their pyramid), it's going to be a bad movie. Why? Because if it was any good, they wouldn't market their product as being 'a celebration of diversity' or '[X/Y] minority pride!' or whatever. Why settle for only attracting black visitors, when you could get black *and* other visitors? Because you can't get other visitors, because the movie isn't good and never was, and it's mostly just pandering to x/y combination of demographics, and you know that as the guy who paid for the film to be made.

Can't say that out loud anymore - especially not given the recent two weeks - but it's rarely been a false statement. Behind closed doors, executives are not scared of stating these things - and they've already told you this implicitly when they determine the marketing material. ""Girl power"" and ""black power"" marketing material means it's the umpteenth count of a company pretending to give a fuck about social issues in order to seperate people from their dollar. They're no different from everyone putting up a rainbow flag on their facebook page but failing to do so in the middle eastern localized pages: It's not about making a statement, or even  about values you believe in - it's about making a buck. And if we can find customers who don't give a fuck if we invest a penny or a pound, we're not spending more than a penny.

The harsh reality is that earnings potential determines how movies are made, not the art-house students or the professionals, and not even the viewers at home. And since people keep rewarding international conglomerates with extra money for doing fuck all but saying ""black people/women/gays are cool"", that is the exact kind of effort and product they're going to continue making.",h7ailm

It's silly to me honestly that so many people get into thinking ""this is what a movie is"". 

Be irritated at something silly like the son taking a shit and finding some gold. That's goofy. Or using flight of the Conchords. That's cringe. 

But seen the same actors play themselves in the flashback without any makeup was just creative way around the budget that works on screen.

I feel Spike Lee did well with ""Malcolm X"" that was a good one, this one is just a bum movie with the racial narrative clumsily done at the expense of a good story , like his other bum movie ""Miracle at St. Anna"".  


He could portray genuine serious racism and issues of prejudice, so he makes the  Army officer a souther hick so racist he decides to fire artillery on his own soldiers...

 It's also a tribute to Vietnam movies, and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Rambo, and black America, and buddy movies and blaxploitation film (using the aged actors in the flashbacks is totally something Melvin van Peebles would've done), and Shakespeare. On top of all that, it was something totally new; Delroy Lindo's character has not been seen on screen before and will probably turn out to be influential.

It wasn't enough to have a young man on a bamboo crutch (wtf, I would bet money Vietnam has enough of a health care system to give this guy a proper crutch at the minimum. Spike couldn't resist the reminder this is POOR ASIA WE'RE IN!!!!111), but then later here's the landmine NGO lady. I guess one foreshadowing event for each land mine incident in the movie.

The fact that they were old during the flashbacks reinforces that. I think Spike Lee likes a little cheese in most of his movies. I've only seen this, Do the Right Thing, Blackkklansman, and Malcolm X, and while the Malcolm X movie played it pretty straight, the others definitely had some aspects that could take you out of the experience if you let it.

The scars of war continually manifest for both sides. Paul, the black Trump supporter, turns his back on his brothers for his own salvation only to be betrayed by his impulse. The younger generation, As symbolized by Paul’s son, recognizes the goodness of his father beneath the surface of bad actions and complacency in the end and carries his legacy toward racial justice in his time. 

I believe the action and many other parts were dramatized for a symbolic effect. It shows how the memories of this war and other black struggles exist in the minds of older black people, and it is constantly seen as over-the-top to popular audiences.

There are plenty of modern biopics and socially conscious films coming out these days that are technically fine, but are thoroughly limited in their ability to be emotionally resonant from their lack of experimentation. I don't need to call anything out, but every years there are tonnes of obvious, paint-by-numbers, Oscar-bait films that are about important things, but are forgotten by the next year. However, Spike Lee's films are nothing if not interesting, and with his recent resurgence that's put him back in the limelight without compromising his unconventional style, between this and BlacKkKlansman he's on a role with truly great films that I think will continue to be talked about well after awards season.",h7ailm

 I’m always curious how people think differently and while it’s a valid concern that would maybe be on the mind of an engineer... it’s not the sort of detail that’s really the object of the narrative to explore imho. All that matters for the film is that they have to haul some heavy ass gold that’s gonna make them rich. The exact value and weight is literally irrelevant. 

 I’m the sort to go along and suspend disbelief mostly and it pisses me off a bit when “nerds” point out the seams of the illusion and pat themselves on the back for it. Because they’re just doing them selves a disservice.

Films are fake, we create these fake obstacle courses for characters to thrive and expose themselves... looking out for the seams of the illusion is kind of taking away from the entertainment that you paid to enjoy, if that makes sense... scrutinizing every detail is counter productive and I’m sure whoever wrote it is well aware of all the tropes and fuzzy logic bits. 

That being said, there was a Netflix film that came out very recently and sort of bombed. Where they solved the weight by flying a chopper, triple frontier.

That's a bit judgmental, but generally the popular explanation is that many Asian countries have become wealthy relatively recently, so a lot of traditional mindsets still stick around. There is also a lot of inequality, which encourages racism and other groupthink behavior, because you're fighting with everyone else for the same few opportunities.

A similar thing is happening in real life, people who have nothing are being manipulated into thinking that it’s the fault of immigrants when in reality it’s the lack of support in the US and globalisation outsourcing and automating ‘low skilled’ jobs.

I liked the soundtrack, though not too big of a fan of isolated tracks. I did like the Chambers Brothers song used (the whole about 15-16 minute version is dope). I don't even mind the common stuff Spike uses like the political/historical in your face history lesson he likes to throw in.

- never seen any elderly Vietnamese out drinking at bars. Most of them hated those places. 
- no vendor dumb enough trying to sell live chicken for foreigners lol what do they do with it? Keep as pet? 
- Black Americans can call each other the N word but that doesn’t justify them calling Vietnamese Gooks. We don’t call ourselves that. It’s not okay for them to call us with radical slur either.

Audience: ""Yeah Spike, that is crazy. Those in power always seems to make oppressed groups blame each other instead of their oppressors. So now that we've identified that, what should we take away from that knowledge?""

Spike: ""Huh? Oh uh... I dunno.""

Audience: ""Should we fight back against it?""

But there may be some deep reasons behind that",h7ailm
fv7qt8u,"Well said but I think we must also consider how influential the US Military is. Movies that don’t in some way valorize American soldiers don’t get made, period. It’s not necessarily a psychological trap of American directors but a financial impossibility for them to express anything else",h7ailm
futd1nl,"This comment should be the most top rated comment in the discussion. I think this is what ruined Spike's movie. Americans, no matter how woke they claim to be will never fully come to a self realization that we were the aggressors in the Vietnam war, and committed unspeakable atrocities.  Try making a movie about Operation Phoenix. Would never happen. 

I was disappointed because I thought Spike had at least enough clout to show the real crimes, the real way America was looked at, at the time by the world when it rained hell on Vietnam. 

I guess no American film director, even on the left, can truly make a movie with that much self reflection. In the end, you always mostly feel bad for the soldiers, who are seen as the true victims rather than the people they were massacring at ungodly rates.",h7ailm
fusuap0,"That's true, but I think my problem with it is that there is no real conclusion to that idea. By the end of the movie, the fact that the Bloods and the Vietnamese should be allies doesn't amount to anything and they kill each other with just the same amount of thoughtlessness that they would in a movie that totally lacks that theme. *Actually that's my problem with the movie in general: it feels like a lot of themes or ideas just kinda go unresolved. For another example, it really felt like the film was trying to say something about the idea of an ""Uncle Tom"". But what it wanted to say, I'm not really sure. After Paul dies, it feels like the character who would be used to resolve that theme is gone and it just gets dropped. Were we supposed to see his death, still wearing his MAGA hat, digging and singing an gospel song (which feels like a purposely piece of slavery imagery) as an absolution of that archetype of the ally with the oppressor? Is it a condemnation of the term Uncle Tom being used to put black people in a box? Or is it a condemnation of those that do cozy up with their oppressors? I mean, Paul dies violently and basically for no reason. 


^(* That and the fact that everyone seems to forget landmines exist 30 seconds after they are brought up or kill someone. The second you meet the French girl you just know someone is stepping on Chekhov's landmine yet somehow none of the Bloods seem to be concerned about landmines.)",h7ailm
furrnex,"Are the bloods then culpable for working for the US government? Vietnam is not some lawless waste, but it's still a pretty poor country. I find it difficult to blame people for working with their oppressors when they have limited options.",h7ailm
fv0sn25,"Yes, but I feel in this regard the movie ""talked the talk, but didn;t walk the walk"".

I'm not accusing Spike Lee of not caring about or hating the Vietnamese or anything like that. But while the movie claims to care about their plight equally with it's mention of My Lai, the Vietnamese characters talking about the struggle during the war, etc. when it comes down to it, it treats its Vietnamese bad guys as little more than action-movie goons. They (including the leader who is the only one to get a name or any characterization) get unceremoniously mowed down by the Bloods with literally no issue. It feels like for all the words about how the Vietnamese and black Americans faced similar oppression, the movie never makes good on that idea. It discards it without a word once it becomes inconvenient.",h7ailm
fuwzqdj,Which is honestly kind of really ironic considering the messages Spike Lee tries to communicate through a lot of his films.,h7ailm

fv2ogzc,"well there's two sides to that. If you go into a Spike Lee movie expecting there not to be anything about black american history, you're nuts. Its like watching a tarentino movie and getting mad because it contains foot fetish stuff. The fuck did you expect? People who complain about the subject matter are idiots. 

On the other hand, he's done it to varying degrees of sucess over his career. At its best, such as Blackkklansman, its completely intergrated into the narrative and doesn't feel like it gets in the way of the story being told, it absolutely elevates it. 

At its worst, its like this movie, which has a boring plot, pretty uninteresting and unlikable characters who you don't really get to know, and seems comparatively shallow, as a vehicle to simply highlight historical black figures through the lens of a shitty heist. 

The story told didn't need to be old men from vietnam. It could have been a group of black men of any age in any country following any conflict. 

Actually fuck it didn't even need to involve a conflict. It just had to be some black men who went somewhere, lost a guy, then came back a bit later. 

The vietnam backdrop and aesthetic was tacked on, and tbh they're kinda pushing the plausibility of them being vietnam war vets. They named 1967 as their first tour, *generously* assuming they were in their late 20s at that time, (considering chadwick boseman was 43 at the time of filming), those men were supposed to be in their 80s, but the oldest among them is 68. Norm lewis was only just fuckin born during the vietnam war! 

Also its daft to suggest that its reviews aren't being boosted at least in part because of what's going on in the US right now. Not one single person reading this would have the balls to give a movie explicitly about black rights a stinker of a review right now. Especially when its directed by a respected black rights figure, containing a cast of popular black actors, and directly calls out donald trump. 

I'm not saying it deserves stinky reviews but its not a fuckin 93% tomato score. a full 30% more than the audience score.",h7ailm

The blood spatter effects look like a stock AfterEffects plugin, which was a bit distracting. It would have looked better without 'em.  The orchestral score was uninspired; it feels like something in a hallmark movie.  The Marvin Gaye was great, but it made the use of Royalty Free Sad Music #3 feel even worse in comparison.  Spike was totally over the top with the blaxploitation tropes in KKKlansman, and it would have been amazing to see his interpretation of the classic Vietnam tropes. The Ride of the Valkyries moment was all we really got on that front. But I guess Tropic Thunder has already tread that ground. 

In the end, this is a great movie, possibly even a classic, but it is certainly not a ""Vietnam"" movie.  It's more like a Christmas Carol: like Ebenezer Scrooge, the greed of the 5 Bloods forces them to reckon with the ghosts of their past, present, and future.  Vietnam isn't a character, it's a prop.  The same movie could be made in 30 years about veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It’s not a bad film by any means, but, being 'movie lovers', I’m sure we can notice the clear flaws of this subpar Spike Lee movie - like the terrible editing, the absolutely incongruent and incoherent tone throughout the film, the blatant and outdated stereotypes from anything (modern) Vietnam related, the awful acting from everyone other than the 5 bloods (and even then, I really didn’t care for Norm Lewis’ performance), and the TERRIBLE original score (it had been a seriously loooong time since, while watching a film, I was taken out of it by the score and ended up thinking “this score is steaming trash”). 

Other than that, there are some terribly interesting, powerful and compelling themes and characters and, as I said, its not a bad movie, but its not even close to being a brilliant one - sadly, because Spike Lee is more than capable of producing masterclass films.",h7ailm

His best movie was ""Malcolm X"" I loved it.  


The issue is this movie it's like he was on amphetamines and was over eager or something.  


**Why in the fuck did he literally pause the movie to put up pictures of historical people on the screen for several seconds along with dates.**  


Like seriously, I knew almost all of them and those I didn't I googled. I've done that in many interesting movies ""Oh wow, I want to check if that was an actual person and verify the accuracy""  


It was plain immersion breaking that Spike felt the need to pause the movie and do it, not once but **multiple times.**  


I was legit embarrassed, like calm down bro, you are a better filmmaker than that.  


Do you remember when Django came out and Spike blasted it as a racist movie and ""oh I haven't seen it"". It was clear he was just mad he didn't come up with the idea for an epic empowering black centred movie that tackles, historical oppression/ slavery in a heavy handed yet also inspiring and creative way.  


Just remember, with Spike's heavyhandedness, this is also the director that made ""Miracle at St. Anna"". In that movie he was so cartoonishly over the top it ruined it!  


He actually made a scene in which a hillbilly southern US army officer in response to news the black unit he commands has advanced and captured a unit quickly:  


**He orders deliberate artillery strikes on the position the men were capturing. Shelling his own men.**  


It was just moronic. There were elite black units in the civil war, almost one hundred years prior. Black units served with distinction in WW1 in france before anyone else (Harlem Hellfighters).  


There simply never would have been an officer actively serving (having his life in the hands of his men) with black troops that would **shell his own men out of spiteful racism**.  


Spike really treats you like an idiot at times. It's doubly insulting when you are an actual member of that minority community and you're well read on the history of some of the most extreme anti-black oppression (Nadir of black civil rights after reconstruction, mary turner lynched pregnant and baby cut out of her, jesse washington burned alive and pieces of him sold as souvenirs).   


A lot of stuff happened. Spike somehow can't invent creative ways to portray that kind of complex history without it coming off moronic or cartoonish. It's a shame.  


The reason this movie has mixed reviews is because he screwed it with things like this, lack of immersion and over-stereotyping of the  vietnamese to the point the film is mocked in Vietnam.",h7ailm

Watching the historical montage at the beginning, so many of these events have slipped away from public memory. They've been forgotten and replaced in our culture by movies about Vietnam. Da 5 Bloods takes this and uses it as a part of its own construction, making unignorable references to other movies and distancing the audience in other ways too like the constant aspect ratio changes, the 4th wall breaks, using the old actors in the flashbacks, and even the fake looking cgi blood. It seems to be saying the enduring relevance of the Vietnam War is Vietnam War movies, the post traumatic scars left on veterans, the minefields that still lay in the ground, and that it was another example of American racial oppression.

I also liked the way he did this in BlackkKlansman with the riff on the ""we solved racism"" comedic movie ending before the actual one. It was also called out as ""silly"" and ""unrealistic"" when that was the whole point. 👍👍 on your point that movies can be more than just what they normally are.

They're brave and skilled but I don't think there was a second where I thought of them as heroes. Just vets like anyone else.

American History would tell you this regardless but really the whole film makes it quite clear that American soldiers can never be heroes in context of the Vietnam war. ""You killed my mother and father"". 

And they kidnap three euros who didn't do anything at all.

The point Spike Lee was trying to make was that Americans committed atrocities over there at the same time the government was committing atrocities in America and that's really it

Using a historical framework that looks to the past and present in order to examine the nature and legacy of conflicts. But the film was a mess, I think it would have been better if he had just made a documentary, the inclusion of archival footage already shows he had people he wanted to talk about.

The MLK speech at the end was supposed to be powerful but I really found myself hating its placement. The way I saw it was the movie would be way more important if it was just that speech Isolates, instead we got 2 1/2 hours of shit with some important stuff and at the end an important speech.

Talking about the first black soldier to receive the Medal of Honor feels relevant to the themes of the film, and the hurdle runner one I thought was a good father-son moment and a cool moment of hope in (imo) the tensest scene in the move. I also thought treating Stormin Norm’s and the other 5 Bloods’s historical photos with the same relevancy as the actual historical photos lended a lot to believing in the squad and the trauma they suffered.

The only thing honest about rotten tomatoes these days is the audience score. Da 5 bloods audience score is 67% and the regular RT score is 91%. If you look at The Witcher Show for example, it has an audience score of 91% and the regular RT score is 67%. Completely flipped. 


Usually the audience will give the more honest ‘unbiased’ score where as the actual critics are scared of getting criticized themselves or labeled “racist” just for saying this kind of  movie was decent but not great. Especially in this day and age. No one wants to face the backlash or have some dumbass fanboy show up at their home at three in The morning and I can understand that but if you’re in that business you could at least try to be more honest and realistic about the reviews you are submitting and that’s why I call out these inflated RT scores.

futhqdw,"Literaly the first cut that happens in the movie after intro section with historical footage is continuity breaking mistake. It made me shout OH NOOOOO, and was a good taste of things to come. If it happened in high school kid's movie, it would still be awful. Or how about the great scene where they find gold and the happy b-movie music starts playing, and then it keeps going on even after they find empty, destroyed chest . Why would you leave happy music in that moment? Don't you want your movie to have ANY tension at all? Just by making it silent while they are digging and then returning the music when they find more gold ingots down the path, the scene would be much more impactful.    


And all those cuts to historical photos/real life footage definetely had nostalgic quality to it. It made me remember all those cheap Pulp Fiction rip-offs from the 90s. I love how people here are praising the exact editing choices they criticized in latest Lars Von Trier movies - the only difference being Von Trier uses those cuts tounge in cheek/to develop character while Spike Lee presents it all like a great wisdom with stone cold face most of the time. 

It's fine if you like the movie, but it is a fact that editing itself was beyond abysmal and there is no excuse for some of the ""choices"" (lazyness would be better word, but I am giving everyone benefit of a doubt).",h7ailm

fuy5b1d," The Book 'Nam is similar to Bloods, in fact might be the first ""Vietnam Oral History Book.""  I found it fascinating since first picking it up in 1985 or so as a wide-eyed early teen, but heard here and there that some of the stories were exaggerations, fabrications, etc.  One story in particular may actually be an urban legend.  I was hooked on Vietnam oral history and picked up Bloods.  The rope trick in the film stuck out right away as one of the ""real life stories"" from the book Bloods.",h7ailm
fun2bee,"Racism is a huge problem in major parts of Asia (and so is colourism). You can literally just google it. Nothing ironic here.

I do think the main reason why racism exists there is because Asian countries rarely have people from other countries (especially in the previous century).

fusycov,"My problem with the movie is that is exactly like the crap Dinesh D'Souza makes. It is literally baffling how bad the editing is, how inhumanely long the movie is while still managing to be extremely shallow in its every aspect, how lazy original music placement is (there were SO many scenes in which cheesy 50s b-movie music would just continue going after it served its puropose and did not fit at all anymore, as if the editor forgot about it), and how in general the movie does not care about anything at all except its simplistic message. Yeah, we all know that stuff Spike, and those who don't certainly are not going to change their minds because of this utter piece of crap. Don't treat us like morons for endless 2 and a half hours, it is offensive for audience at its worst and so bad that it is good at its best - which is rarely, but I did laugh a few times. Apperance  of literal BLM at the end, as if the rest of this crap was too subtle, was THE surrealist movie moment of the year.

In my whole life, I have given only one movie a 1/10. Vile right wing propaganda called An American Carol. I came close with this one, but did not in the end because of all the beautiful Marvin Gaye songs they used in it. While this does not change my mind about few great movies Spike did make throughout his career, some of which are more relevant than ever (unlike this mess which will be dated in 6 months), I cannot help but have extremely low opinion of the man because of his work in last 10-20 or so years. Either he views his audience like total morons, or he is a total moron himself. I don't know which is worse.",h7ailm

fuvd3dj,"i like what your saying, but isnt the death of 3/4ths of the bloods supposed to be the conclusion? like, isnt that the reckoning for their role in ruining the lives of the Vietnamese? Like with Paul, he didn’t die for no reason, he was killed by Vietnamese people who had lost loved ones in the war and wanted to take back what they felt was rightfully theirs. 

A consistent theme throughout was reckoning with your past and how memories can leave negative impacts. They say they come back to Vietnam to reclaim the memory of their friend, but in reality it all becomes about the gold and greed. I think its meaningful that none of them were able to make it out alive because it offered consequences for refusing to reckon with their tangible role in ruining the lives of hundreds of people. Their ultimate demise are the people they disregarded due to the focus on their own narrative. Like obviously this kind of takes a backseat bc as a spike lee movie the focus is always going to be on the black perspective. but in this movie more than any of his others i think he did a really god job of showing how warped the black perspective can be due to hundreds of years of oppression from their supposed “home country”. Delroy’s character is basically the embodiment of this idea; they showed all the completely valid reasons behind why he behaves and thinks the way he does, but that doesnt absolve him of wrongdoing and in the end he gets his due. 

And the only original blood who lives is the one who actually had a real, emotional reason to return to the country. yes it was about the gold for him, but it was really about the rekindling of a relationship that he abandoned. he lives in order to reckon with that. again, i appreciate your viewpoint, but just my two cents!",h7ailm

fusvzzy,"When speaking to Vinh, the chicken guy said he hadn't sold a thing all day. I guess the reason for his pushiness was that he was desperate to sell something? But if it's a tourist attraction and you can get fined for that behavior, as you say, then perhaps it's still not very realistic. Still though, Lee does give context for why he's trying so hard to sell the chicken. And then things escalate when Paul calls him a gook. 

I think Lee was so focused on the experiences of the black veterans that he took some liberties with Vietnamese culture and how it was portrayed. Not an excuse, of course, but just a potential reason for why he did things the way he did. The whole chicken seen was only there to highlight Paul's anxiety and living trauma that he carries. This was similar with the boy throwing the firecrackers. He wasn't thinking 'is this realistic for Vietnam?'. He was thinking about how these scenes portray and develop the black characters, whom are the focus of the film. I'm in no way saying this was the right way to go about it, and I probably would have liked it more had he handled the cultural aspects with a little more care.

You dont have to stretch your imagination that far to see how certain events in the film could happen. Its also a very surreal movie with a focus on the black american historical narrative.

furygpr,"You’re so right. Spike Lee’s constant awareness of the current moment he’s making movies in is somehow used against him. He masterfully makes clear the connection between the narrative he’s weaving and current struggles for racial justice yet somehow when the relevance is delivered so clearly people reject it for whatever reason they can seem to come up with. Of course, I’m sympathetic to his message but I mean it’s really disheartening to see people rationalize themselves out of how they are implicated to change their actions right now. 

I’m sure Spike Lee will be heralded as a genius filmmaker by society at large once he passes or ceases to implicate contemporary audiences. But it seems that so many people simply cannot see past the bias they hold towards any ongoing movement and so it makes it virtually impossible for directors like Lee to truly affect their white audiences as it seems they should.",h7ailm

Your second paragraph provides many actual reasons related to the movie that some people may not like it. I not only understand those reasons but agree with them as well to a certain extent. 

By no means did I want to give the impression that someone is exposing themself as racist for having a negative opinion of the movie.

I accept your comments about the movie itself even though I wholeheartedly disagree with them, but you lost me at calling me insane for not uselessly speculating about the motives of reviewers. 

I could care less if you or any other person—critics included—like the movie, and I can remove enough bias to observe what the general sentiment around the movie is. A lot of people really like the movie regardless of real world context, and it is not an objective truth that civil unrest is responsible for great review scores or influencing them.

BUT I disagree that this is not a movie about Vietnam. Yeah it's got Treasure of the Sierra Madre all over it, and a lot of other things besides, but it was also specifically about that war.

Secondly, if somehow that kid can find a dealer, he definitely cannot afford it. It costs more than $ 5 for a piece of firecrackers like the one in the movie. The same amount of money can feed a whole family of low incomes for a day in VN. I am highly doubt that the beggar kid would do something like this.

Also that chicken guy just cracks me up. Hundreds from my country go all year round to Vietnam and SE Asia to travel and see the incredible sights. I imagine the same goes for the US. Is he screaming at all foreigners who wont buy chicken? Or just americans? Or is it boomer americans? Also the way it was shot I'm 100% with Paul, if someone kept waving a chicken in my face after I told them no 5 times I'd get mad too.

But I don’t think the violence was glorified. In the flashback scenes a triumphant, old school score plays and the killing of the enemy is definitely being glorified as a way of showing their memory being romanticized. But the present-day scenes are very somber and there’s no score to accompany it. It’s senseless violence. 

And again, I don’t think the film tries to say “Oh they’re the good guys”. They’re just guys, who lost a piece of themselves in the war and are still the killing machines that they were all those years ago. They’re broken men that feel owed something, and they’re going to fight no matter what for that. But they’re the protagonists of the movie, so surely it’s going to be shown from their perspective and they’re going to “win” in the end. The only one who’s explicitly celebrated as a “good” guy in the end is Eddie, who didn’t participate in the killing fest that the others did because he died from the mine. Even then, he admits to fucking up in his life with the money he made on different vices. It sucks that those mercenaries or whatever got mowed down at the end, but it’s not this awesome fuck yeah moment where you’re going “Woo kill those bastards!” At least that’s not the tone I got or any of my family members got when watching this. You’re free to have interpreted it differently obviously.",h7ailm

Side note: this is just a stupid thing for me specifically as an American. I always feel so bad because Jean Reno is an acclaimed actor who has been in a lot of movies in France and abroad. But as an American every time I see him I can't unthink of 1998's Godzilla XD",h7ailm

If I'd change the films I'd have delved a bit more into that group. I guess though why I don't see as much issue is due to the film from the beginning to across the journey emphasizing that only Paul is openly prejudiced to the Vietnamese and the overall attitude is treating the Vietnamese people like people. Da Bloods interact with Vietnamese people with respect and treat them like human beings even speaking the Vietnamese they remembered to the locals they encounter.

This one really angered her though. She just wouldn't show it. I'm pretty sure I know why she didn't like it and a lot of white have an issue with it, and that's because Spike purposely makes the film entirely about the black experience without anyone else. There are white characters but they really mean nothing to the movie. They are there only in service to give us context on Malcolm. And that's not a bad thing either. It's really just pulling you into the mind of a black man and getting a real experience. It's probably the most real black experience you can find on film I think.

futh7y7,"Spike Lee must had a consultant team. They failed at their job, or maybe he was too stubborn. Who knows? As I said, I appreciate all the messages for black people. But I can’t be happy when Vietnam has become a “tool” for these. 

Spike Lee wanna focused on the black lives in Vietnam War, but he did not give a proper portrayal of Vietnamese. Is it the same when other directors wanna focused on the white soldiers, and intentionally forget the black? 

Vietnam War and the aftermath are complex matters, even to Vietnamese. I expected Spike Lee to do better, but he just repeated the past from Hollywood. 

For the chicken guy, I would try to explain a little bit. After the war, the North won over the South. Many Southerners blame the Americans for withdrawing from the battle. But will they hate the Americans? I think not. For the Northerners, strangely, they don’t hate Americans as many would think. Bill Clinton, Obama, G.W. Bush and even Trump were welcome. I had some American friends coming here several years ago, and they were surprised that there were no hatred to be found. However, the tension between Northerners and Southerners still exists, even among younger generation. So I found the chicken guy in the movie totally unrealistic in terms of today. That may happen in the 80s, 90s, but definitely not now.",h7ailm

The NGO may have a contract to work in the area, but are they risky enough with these gunmen lurking around? And even with a contract, do you think they won’t be secretly followed by the government? 

And it’s 2020 already. The Vietnamese in the film are still cliche, not much different from movies in the past. I know Spike Lee wanted to focus on the black lives, I just want to point out how wrong the background is, and how wrong Vietnam has been portrayed all along.",h7ailm

This is not the case for me. I think its excellent that people are making content and flooding the media with earnest and heartfelt stories about the black experience in America. This is the kind of stuff that changes society for the better.

While his messages are hard hitting and sincere, the filmmaking itself tends to be really fucking corny, unoriginal, and sometimes outright bad.

There were several musical montages (4 or 5 being Marvin Gaye songs) that was overdone and makes it clear Spike doesn't know how to show a passage of time.

Yeah, PTSD or not, he was right to be annoyed.

It has been difficult trying to parse my feeling on the film from this point of view of representation of the Vietnamese, and I guess they'll be somewhat limited, me being a white Russian-European who has only spent a couple of weeks in Vietnam. I've been trying to educate myself on my blind spots, but I just can't justify what Lee did with this movie (which I will continue to say has a lot of merit and I'll be the first to applaud when Delroy Lindo gets his Oscar next year). The AVClub review for the film addresses some of these points, but the comments say stuff along the lines of, ""Don't tell a black man the sort of film he should be making. White Hollywood has been making these films forever."" Which sounds like a fair point, but truth be told I can't think of one Vietnam war film made by other directors that treats the Vietnamese people as such a borderline afterthought or cannon fodder. I guess the worst you can say is that they treated the Vietnamese only as victims, but frankly that's a step up from mindless thugs that we see in this film's third act.

Maybe he was trying to make something more satirical, along the lines of Three Kings? But even in that film the heroes realise that what they were doing was wrong and give away all of the gold to save the local people. (I'd have loved to see what John Ridley, a black man and writer of Three Kings, would have done with the script for Da 5 Bloods.) And none of those films dared to use brutal archival footage such as the guy getting shot or photos of the massacres such as a little girl with her face blown off, because they knew the power of stuff like that. Lee throws all that in, but it just rings hollow because he clearly doesn't give that much of a damn seeing how the people are represented otherwise. It feels exploitative and gross in a way that other films about Vietnam haven't.

And it's not like Lee is a veteran of the war, he was just a kid when it was happening, so I have much more respect for the point of view of an actual veteran like Oliver Stone when it comes to depicting Vietnam. Hell, in Stone's Vietnam films, the representation of the black soldiers was pretty decent, from my memory. So it's like, I'll take the point that I am not African American and know nothing of those struggles, but I would counter those who say that Lee can make any damn film he wants because Da 5 Bloods has otherwise landmark stuff to say with the view that a Vietnam film that is *this* tone deaf on some key points doesn't really exist. And that is worth criticising. Maybe my memory fails me, but from Apocalypse Now through Dead Presidents, can't think of one. Hell, now that I think of it, Dead Presidents covers some of same ground as this film and was directed by the Hughes Brothers (how underrated are those guys?). I need to give it a rewatch.",h7ailm

I am very familiar with Spike Lee’s work and it actually would not surprise me to find out that he didnt have a consultant on the film lol bc has never been all that interested in accuracy even with certain aspects of black history (i.e the black panthers in black kkklansman). Because he wanted to focus on this theme of “scars of war” I agree he did change Vietnam to match his intended theme, and I can 100% see how that can be offensive. I do know that a majority of his research is based off of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Bloods-Black-Veterans-Vietnam-History/dp/0345311973), and I believe he characterized modern Vietnam as the way some of the accounts in this book do despite the fact that modern Vietnam is nothing like it",h7ailm

That would make sense if the movie made them out to be cold hearted criminals but the movie makes them out to be good guys.

They are all still upset about Norm dying the entire movie and then their friend dies in front of them and they didn't have any problems leaving his body behind and they didn't grieve for more that 1 minute. 

>While I can definitely think of some justifications for them not being more emotional on Melvin’s death,

Spike is not a darling of critics in the same way some directors are, plus it’s basically impossible to improve with more than a gut feeling. 

Overall I agree with you, even with your complaints about the movie.

fvxk6ct,">And it's not like Lee is a veteran of the war, he was just a kid when it was happening, so I have much more respect for the point of view of an actual veteran like Oliver Stone when it comes to depicting Vietnam. Hell, in Stone's Vietnam films, the representation of the black soldiers was pretty decent, from my memory. 

Interestingly, Oliver Stone was attached to direct an earlier draft of the script. That was before it was a movie predominantly about black characters though, I think. Lee came on with his collaborators and they rewrote it into what the movie became, before that I think it was just a three kings/Kelly's Heroes type movie.

The only modern war movie I'd think to compare this one to is, in a strange way, Hacksaw Ridge. Large difference in the amount of violence of course but Hacksaw Ridge had a similar relation, to me at least, where the japanese were just bodies being thrown around as props and almost completely uninteresting next to our american heroes. Maybe I just bring that up because I have a need to hate on Hacksaw Ridge when the opportunity arises, but it's the closest one I can think of. Most movies today seem to either avoid racist or poor portrayals of real nationalities, or invent fake nationalities or enemies (like all superhero movies ever) to not have to make a nuanced portrayal.

Black Hawk Down has a similiar ish problem where all the Somalian characters are blatantly played by actors who don't look somali at all. But other than that that movie makes no effort to portray the somalis as anything but a horde.",h7ailm

i think it’s obvious why the scores are different. Spike Lee has always been a polarizing filmmaker! He makes highly stylized, racially and politically driven stage plays that he happens to put on film. They aren’t for everybody. Some people are uncomfortable with his politics, some people don’t like the on-the-nose dialogue he employs to illustrate his themes, some people just don’t like him as a person. He’s always had this type of response since She’s Gotta Have It. I think critics have the art and the subtext at the forefront of their minds when watching a movie, so they tend to appreciate things that a certain section of the general audience might not! I think it’s precisely because of the times that critics are appreciating the timing and seizing of the moment and the zeitgeist that this movie employs.

I really don’t think any of the flashbacks are intended to be real life accurate portrayals of what happened in the moment. Thinking back to the flashback of Paul accidentally shooting Norm, the VC soldier moved through the scene like a villain in a children’s play. It’s a stylistic portrayal of memory and how people distort/build up things over time in their minds. I think all those choices of camera quality, glorifying shots, over the top dramatics, and keeping the 4 living bloods at their current ages was a choice to show how much these memories still live with these veterans. While jarring at first, by the end of the movie when they showed the de-aged photo of Da 5 Bloods I loved the choice. Great film and easily a top 5 Spike Lee joint imo",h7ailm

I was hoping for a movie about black people that fought in Vietnam and their history and what it would be like going back.  I was excited for that movie.  The movie just wasn't that good and I believe got overrated, hence the huge difference between critic and audience reviews.

The best part of the movie was Delroy Lindo's performance which I thought was pretty accurate for some veterans coping with PTSD.

What we got was an OK beginning and premise of going back to Vietnam to find their friend, and then the son came and was money-hungry, that was silly, the random landmine blowing up their friend and barely any emotion was silly.  Started to lose me there.  Felt more like a bad Tropic Thunder.  Then it turns into an action movie against the Vietnamese in the jungle which was all over the place?  It was just too much.

I also thought they portrayed the Vietnamese poorly.  I've spent a lot of time there and there's zero hate for Americans.  It's quite the opposite and they're some of the best people around.

Forget about if it was white people I'll take that back.  If this movie came out a year ago I think the ratings would be very different.

fv87wj2,">disjointed

The editing was fucking awful and awkard. It didn't know if it wanted to be stylish or not, so it settled with stylish every so often with these awkward repeated cuts that feel out of place. It also had an extreme overuse of musical montages to show passage of time. Every Marvin Gaye song was used in this manner, and that's honestly kind of disrespectful. 

That's what he meant. Just cause you don't understand it due to lack of experience doesn't mean it doesn't convey anything. 

> self indulgent 

It's a Spike Lee film. Of course it's self indulgent. Now, I don't think that makes it a negative but come on man. It's Spike Lee for god's sake. 

> Could you explain why you think it's over long or boring 

You could have easily cut down like 20 minutes by getting rid of those unnecessary musical montages alone. 

Now, the boring parts for many like me, might not be boring to you if you haven't seen a lot of top tier filmmaking. For instance, the action scenes were boring as fuck because they weren't well done. The extremely unoriginal and corny score often ruined any sort of seriousness that could be brought to the shootouts. The cinematography already was cheap, but that score...fuck, dude. When you compare the shootouts from Saving Private Ryan to this, you'll see what I'm talking about. There's no weight or intensity. It's filmed like a montage and that's not good. 

The acting from everyone but the 5 Bloods was god fucking awful as well. You might not have noticed if you don't know much about acting, or how to appreciate it yet, but for people like me? Fuck, dude. I couldn't take most of the acting seriously, therefore I'm starting to doze off everytime Delroy Lindo leaves the screen, cause he was the only phenomenal performance here. 

Anyways there you go. You definitely didn't read this and I'm probably going to be downvoted because ppl are stupid, but that's why this movie isn't that good.

I don't think adding historical context to the beginning of GWTW is a bad thing. Do I think it is absolutely necessary? Not really, but there's no skin off my nose. 

I guess the situations are different but the dichotomy is still interesting to me as to what we are and aren't giving disclaimers for.

Another note: I don't want to come off as being rude but do you actually think people are saying ""oh this is rated R, we may see graphic real-life images of kids with their faces blown off. Maybe I don't want to watch this."" I feel as though the MPAA ratings are practically irrelevant in the streaming age. No kid under 18 is being restricted from watching Da 5 Bloods...

The simplest way I can put it is that movies are generally about a character changing due to their actions in response to external circumstances. 

Plays (and Da 5 Bloods) are generally about interpersonal conflict and the individual's relationship with their society. 

They use different styles of dialogue and acting and have different patterns of rising and falling action. Da 5 Bloods is more like Shakespeare than it is like most movies, (excluding the cinematography, of course.) 

It has nothing to do with whether you like dialogue driven movies or not. The works of Tarantino and Neil Simon are both highly dialogue-driven, but Tarantino's stuff wouldn't work on the stage, and Simon's stuff (IMHO, despite winning tons of awards), didn't work as well on film.",h7ailm

I guess, ostensibly, you would think people who have seen their fair share of fake graphic violence would be less responsive to real graphic images. I'm not sure if it is the case though.

I think people are more disturbed by the context rather than the actual images. It is much easier to rationalize a man being blown up in a movie, knowing its fake and he is an actor and it is all special effects. I think people are affected knowing that that photo of the child is real, he was a real, he was someone's son, and he was violently killed, in real life. 

I'm going to have to think about all of this a bit more. But I think we're on the same page.

fuqdzcb,"I don't actually think stories about interpersonal conflict work worse in movies, I think them appearing in movies more rarely than in theater has a lot to do with stories about external circumstances often appeal to the more mainstream hollywood movie audience more. 

Anyway, two things. 

Firstly, I actually wish this would have stayed a movie about interpersonal conflict, I didn't love the first half either, but to me this movie completely fell apart completely once it became an action film of US veterans defending their gold, first against some sort of NGO and then gainst a group of Vietnamese soldiers who work for a french James Bond villain. If anything, I expected this movie to be entirely about how those Vietnam veterans interact with eachother and it was one of the reasons I was really looking forward to it. 

Secondly, I didn't have a problem with the fact that this was about interpersonal conflict, but with how the interpersonal conflict was handled. I felt like charakters acted in really strange and often stupid ways, especially when they interacted. Something like when Paul says David isn't his son anymore it felt like it came so randomly and unearned. Just because someone has PTSD that's not an excuse to let your charakters do whatever you need them to do for the plot in that moment and it's even less of an excuse if the rest of the charakters easily accept the weird behaviour. And that's not a movie problem, charakters have to act believably in every kind of story and if the sense of ""believable"" is stretched in your story it at least has to be done so consistently. But here I had the feeling I was looking at a completely different charakter in every single scene. 

Oh and a small thing that doesn't really have anything to do with Da 5 bloods, but I actually think Tarantino's movies are about interpersonal conflict a lot. I mean, stuff like Reservoir Dogs or the Hateful 8 is pretty much just a bunch of guys sitting in a house and talking for the majority of the film.",h7ailm

Even worse, it assumes that anybody with a contrary opinion have every right to like/dislike a film, but must admit they are wrong for it.

That is not what you originally said. You said:

Those are two wildly different statements.

>Not racist but it does lack context to why that is. 

Oh, no shit? When you say a wildly racist statement with no context people think it's racist? It doesn't even matter if you believe the underlying assumption that would be required to make that statement sarcasm, you don't, because you're so terrible at expressing yourself and you aimlessly throw controversial statements around with no context that it proves my original point, that you are a racist troll.

I literally can't, because it was removed for being racist, because it is racist, but that doesn't even matter as I clearly laid out. Did you not even read what I just wrote? At least make an effort to comprehend.

>Also sorry you don’t know the correlation between “deadly” and “murder rates”... Get your water wings bruh, you’re drowning. 

No, you idiot, you literally said you were going to make a statistically sound statement, then made a statement that was wholly inaccurate.

That is not true, what is true is that black people in the United States are disproportionately represented in violent crime stats.",h7ailm

Communication and ideas require context, they don't exist in a void, your complete inability or unwillingness to provide that makes what you're saying counter-productive to your here stated goals and beliefs. I'm honestly still operating that there is some chance you are actually just this unaware of what you're doing and trying to help you. The mere fact that you believe you're somehow ""winning"" though I think speaks to my original assumption being wholly accurate. You intentionally want people to think you're racist so you can piss people off and argue to try and get to some bizarre ""gotcha"" moment.
