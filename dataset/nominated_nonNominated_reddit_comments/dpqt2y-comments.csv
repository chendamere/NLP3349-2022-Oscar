I loved this film. I just didn't get how neighbors, the state or anybody offered to take care of the kid after his mom died.

f7da88p,"Saw it tonight and loved it. Just wanted to share my theater experience as I thought I witnessed something really sweet:

So I was in a really small theater and directly in front of me was a mom and her probably 13 year old son. As the previews began they started going back and forth arguing because the son wanted to get popcorn and the mom was telling him no. This went on for what seemed like 5 straight minutes as he kept persisting and it got to the point where she just goes, “I will drag you out of this theater right now if you don’t stop and watch the movie.” Needless to say he was pissed but finally gave up when the movie started and I just laughed to myself.

Fast forward to the end of the movie, and we obviously just sat through this very deep and emotional story centering around a close mother-son relationship. As soon as the closing credits started rolling, I look down and see the boy leaned over tightly hugging his mom. 

It was a small thing to witness, but I just found it really touching to see how the story clearly moved this boy.",dpqt2y
f6vfi6k,"i didnt see much comment on this, but i loved the scene where the older hitler youth kids are being sent off to die on the front and still acting like stupid teens, mocking some dumb kid. it really drives home how young and immature they are and makes even those guys sympathetic.",dpqt2y

f6tv52c,Something I haven't seen many people talking about yet is how immediately after the butterfly scene as Jojo is mourning Waititi lets the camera sit on the roof dormers (like the one Elsa can look out of in her hiding spot) looking over the hanging.

one of my favorite movies of the year.",dpqt2y
f5zdrh5,"Captain Deertz having his whole group saying ""Heil Hitler"" one by one killed me, despite the suspense of Elsa getting caught.

I love how gradual Jojo's respect and love for Elsa grows throughout the movie (despite the extreme adversity between the two), the chemistry between them was fantastic. By the time they were dancing at the end, I had a huge smile on my face; it felt like the true beginning of a beautiful friendship",dpqt2y
f694war,"While a lot of people have pointed out the focus that was put on Rosie's shoes and how it sets up the future gut punch I feel like I haven't seen anyone discuss the relationship between Jojo learning to tie his shoes, how it parallels his evolving worldview, and how it relates to one of the over-arching themes of the movie.

At the beginning of the movie, Jojo doesn't know how to tie his shoes and needs his mother to do it for him. At this same point in time his worldview is immature (you could even argue that it's non-existent); he's entirely bought into Nazi propaganda and parrots all their beliefs. He needs someone to tell him what/how to think as he doesn't have the experience to form his own ideas. 

As the movie goes on he takes these beliefs and ideas out into the world where they begin to be challenged. He sees the bodies of Germans being hung, bonds with Elsa, and discusses the war with his mother. Ultimately, he discovers her body as a result of her involvement in the resistance. He tries to tie her shoes for her as he mourns but ends up failing halfway through. 

To me this represented the true test of his beliefs. There's an internal conflict between his support of Nazi-ism and the love of his mother & Elsa. He's struggling to reconcile his support of the war with the horrors he's seen.  How can his mother, his caretaker, the best person he knows, be will to sacrifice everything to fight against everything he believes in? While he doesn't completely denounce Nazi-ism at this point you can tell that, at the very least, he's halfway there. While he couldn't tie his mother's shoes, he was able to get halfway done.

His disillusionment continues to grow through out the battle preparations, his discussion regarding Jews with Yorki, and the conclusion of the war itself, culminating with him yeeting imaginary Hitler out of a window.  It's only after this that we finally see him successfully tie Elsa's shoes.

Tying your shoes requires a base level of coordination, dexterity, and fine motor skills and is considered a developmental milestone. It's one of the first things you learn that requires actual effort and practice; it requires trial & error. It marks the transition between infancy and childhood.

In the same vein, a nuanced and mature out look on life isn't something that you're born with or can be given. It's something that is constantly evolving, refined by life experience; it's something that you have to be open to and to continue to work on/towards. Realizing this is a milestone and marks the transition between childhood and adolescence. 

To me Waititi is saying that Nazi-ism and other worldviews based on massive generalizations and hatred of those who are different than oneself are immature and childish. Recognizing this is so fundamental; so incredibly basic; that it can be compared to learning tie your shoes. Much like how tying your shoes is a key marker in growing up, hate-based ideology is similarly juvenile and must be left behind.",dpqt2y
f7domu1,"Scarlett Johansson dying in this film gave me a far greater gut punch than her death in Endgame ever did.

She was really charismatic in this film, the characters were all written great!!",dpqt2y
f7khpsx,I’m thinking the recurring motif of shoes is also a reference to the thousands of shoes on display at various Holocaust museums that were taken away from those arriving to the concentration camps. It’s always a startling image.,dpqt2y
f67phbc,"I did not expect to love this movie as much as I did.

I went in only knowing the logline but my expectations were completely exceeded. I loved the humor, the heart, the performances, the satire, it was honestly my favorite movie this year since Booksmart.

But holy shit that Butterfly scene still haunts me. I initially thought ""Oh I bet a Nazi is gonna crush the butterfly, being a cheesy metaphor for Elsa's imminent danger."" But then the camera fucking panned up to the reveal and my jaw literally dropped, that brilliant, subtle reveal felt like a punch in the gut. What I love about movies is the roller coaster-ride of emotions -- joy, love, anger, sadness, triumph -- and this movie definitely made me feel all of them. 

Overall solid 10/10 movie and I'd bet money that it's gonna be at least nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay",dpqt2y

- ""I just need a cuddle""

- Jojo defending himself as a Nazi because ""I'm massively into swastikas""

f5ze4gq,"I love how Taika established the shoes of Jojo's mom, by the time we saw them hanging we already knew who it was.",dpqt2y
f60u3qr,"The part where Yorki hugs Jojo in the metal costume was too cute. I loved their friendship, I wish there was a little more screentime with them together. Jojo's reading letters to Elsa were also some of my favorite moments. Solid coming-of-age movie, overall. I like how they made fun of blind fanaticism and hatred, without it feeling preachy to me. I want to recommend this movie to more of my friends and family, but I mention nazi youth, Hitler, and satire, and I kinda lose people.",dpqt2y
f85s9f0,"In the final scenes of the movie, when Jojo is flipping through his book, one of the pages is illustrated with a key and a caged rabbit. After seeing the page, Jojo decided to free Elsa, so arguably the caged rabbit symbolized Elsa. The beginning of camp showed that Jojo was not capable of killing a rabbit,  foreshadowing his inability to betray Elsa.

However, the film is called ""Jojo Rabbit,"" Jojo had been ridiculed as JoJo the rabbit, and even the imaginary Hitler friend tells Jojo to embrace his identity as a ""rabbit."" What I took away from the movie is that the rabbit symbolized childhood innocence, full of friendship and love.

Jojo is only 10, and despite his efforts in trying to be a Nazi, his innocence prevents him from killing the rabbit. His imaginary Hitler friend, although at times supportive, is corrupting Jojo's innocence; he is told that the rabbit is cunning and vengeful. Jojo doesn't know how to tie his shoelaces (a process in which Rosie described as making rabbit ears), a skill expected from a child at his age.

When Jojo witnesses the death of Rosie, he tries to tie her shoelaces, but couldn't. Only in the final scenes, when Jojo decides to free Elsa, and evicts imaginary Hitler from his mind, does he bend down and tie Elsa's shoelaces. Jojo embraces his childhood innocence and shares it with Elsa.",dpqt2y

f6hiot1,"yorki was totally, wonderfully played. every time he came on screen the audience was squealing. i wish there was more discovery in rosie and the captain, it's clear he knew to step in when jojo was getting inspected but we never figure out why or how he knew. also i should've known about the mom's death they allude to it with shoe shots throughout!!! overall very sweet, and also.....just kept getting darker and darker. wow.",dpqt2y
f61ltzd,To say that this movie is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. I think Taika Waititi is one of the few people to be able to pull of a coming of age story that’s morbidly funny at the same time.,dpqt2y
f703vr7,"Towards the end of the movie the scene where the Germans are making their last stand and you see children and businessmen and soldiers charging into battle is so fucking good. Like it may be one of my favorite scenes from any movie ever. Also the buildup where Yorki (I think it was him) lists all the countries that are against Germany and concludes they must all just be wrong is so cleverly done.

It's just so poignant in how tragically funny it is. The war effort is clearly lost but we see shot after shot of the absurdity of the final stand. I also think that despite this being a semi-comedic movie it does a great job depicting just how much the order and structure breaks down in the final moments. Earlier in the movie we see characters getting scolded for raising ideas like recruiting ""German Shepards"" or designing new uniforms but in the end both of these play out on the battlefield as there is no longer anyone there to maintain the Nazi party's order and calm they tried to maintain even in the final days.

Really fantastic movie.",dpqt2y

f7kfc7e,"Just saw it today. Wow. There's so much. 

I think people have talked up Sam Rockwell's character in significant length already so it's hard to find much to ad there. Or at how hard of a gutpunch Rose's death was. 

I guess one that stood out for me was Elsa's 'strength' speech. I'm not religious, but her delivering that line ('we fought giants' or whatever the exact wording was) with such obvious strength of faith was really something. Her actress' performance was intense and amazing.

And not that it needs to be said, but 'fuck off, Hitler' is never *not* a perfect way to cap off a film.",dpqt2y

f6046tq,"I was laughing so hard I was screaming during the Beatlemania opening. It was so fucking insane, but it worked. (Just wish the rest of the movie had that kind of fire.) The reveal on Scarlett's shoes was brutal and I loved Elsa's monologue about how Jews are stronger than Nazis. That was powerful.

Also loved watching Alfie Allen. His body language was just like a 1930s actress. Kind of sad too when you realize he and Sam Rockwell were probably just trying to stay alive when they otherwise would have been sent to the camps.",dpqt2y

f6tr8ic,"This movie is quite possibly one of my new favorite movies of all time! Everybody did such a fantastic job! My only pet peeve was Hitler and the cigarettes since he was very much against smoking, but then again I remembered that this is a child’s imaginary friend. Scarlett Johansson did phenomenal! Possibly the best I’ve seen her act! The scene with her acting as the father made me cry a bit but I broke down when Jojo found her. By the end of the movie I really fell for Elsa😍

This movie made me rediscover why I loved going to the movies as a kid. It made me laugh, cry, and overall just reflect on my own life. There is such a disconnect between critics and general audiences nowadays, I’m so glad I ignored the reviews.",dpqt2y

f6jzz0w,"Fascists love to imagine themselves bigger than they really are. *Ahhh*, they drawl, dragging on a cigarette, *yes, we call for blood and personality cults and rigidly stratified hierarchies and death to the enemy race, but you see: we speak to the people, and we bring prosperity, and now the trains run on time.* So goes the myth. In this telling, fascism may be bad, but it’s the *cool* kind of bad. You know: the grand, rugged, glamorous kind of bad; the kind that knows what it wants and takes it and maybe deserves to have it on sheer strength of will alone. So often fascism gets to be the Byronic hero of political systems. Such is the power of the myth. Individually and collectively, many historical dramas feed its glow.

*Jojo Rabbit* cuts it off at the knees. It takes the Nazis’ proudest win — the total mobilization of Germany, men and women and children alike — and skewers the inefficient absurdity of its design. Militarizing kids sounds big until you see them walking around in boy scout gear, tripping into grenades, lugging guns they’ve only fired in their dreams, getting under their teachers’ skin. That’s the silly part. Then you see them shipped off to die in a losing war because there are no more men left to burn, and that’s just sad. The myth shrivels in the face of those images. There’s no way to take this so-called efficiency seriously when it’s so painfully clear that their tactics come down to desperation.

Taika Waititi finds plenty of jokes on these grounds. He’s never without a barb for the Nazis’ delusional grandiosity, which is funny and also politically helpful: nothing kills a glamour like laughter. But he doesn’t laugh at everything, either, because he knows where the power lies. The economy slows; the trains go to shambles; the fascists never deliver on their promises of plenty — but there is one thing they can do, and that’s the myth.

Waititi is deadly serious about the power of myth: the fantasy of being a somebody, a part of a bigger something, and never wanting for glory or purpose or love. Jojo Betzler aches to belong to something, as children do. He joins the Nazis for the myth. He becomes a fanatic in a desperate stab at being more than an ugly, lonely boy. And he believes it all the more fiercely because he’s afraid he’ll be empty when it’s gone. (Why does this sound familiar?) No wonder his imaginary Adolf Hitler is such a dream friend, silly to play with and too strong to knock around and deeply fascinated by the daily turnings of his ten-year-old life. The story of fascism is that it’s always there for you. Jojo’s challenge in growing up is learning to let that comfort go.

This is not to say the movie casts all stories as childish things. Elsa has her own: a dead boyfriend she pretends alive, a raft of Jewish monsters to scare her Nazi housemate stiff. These stories sustain her. She has every right to tell them. What Jojo needs to do is shake off the evil tales — the myths handed down with pictures of devil-Jews — and learn to tell his own off a blank page.

I could rattle on more about the honey-colored light, the saturated tableaux, the punchy costumes, every bit with the shoes, the expert seeding and pacing, the feeling in that kid’s face… but then I’d be here for hours, and all of that is fluff anyway. Craft is just a vessel for ideas, and *Jojo Rabbit* is sweetly, sincerely, unpretentiously full of them. It reclaims fantasy from authority and presses us to dream up something more real. I think that’s rad.",dpqt2y

f69ylah,"I really loved this movie, it reminded me a lot of the Death of Stalin in its tone. The performances were powerful, and I wanted to cry both in the shoes scene and the Sam Rockwell execution scene. 

I get the feeling this movie is going to be panned just because it is “making light” of hitler in a time when nazism is politically pertinent again, but just like springtime for hitler it is the absurdity that makes it work. We are never put in a position to be sympathetic to nazism, only to a child nazi and a gay nazi who hates his own cause, and a woman nazi forced to be a baby machine. They are all hiding in a way, hiding sympathy, hiding love, and the movie asks for empathy for them. It goes beyond the typical “surviving nazism” story for those reasons. 

I was very sad and also laughing the whole time. Loved this movie",dpqt2y
f6t84kc,"I have to wonder if the people who graded this movie poorly managed to sit through the whole of it. I could see someone walking away upset if they only caught the first ten or fifteen minutes.

The film isn't shy about the absurdity of Nazi Germany as a concept. And it wants you to know that it's okay to laugh at that absurdity. But  it never strays far from the fact that there was also a clear, present, imminent danger to the society's scapegoats and those who would protect them.

This film almost always presents the world through the eyes of its protagonist. Only in rare times are we taken away from Jojo. And so it makes sense that the film starts with an indoctrinated child's view of the reich and the war. But the film takes care to bring the audience on a journey as those rosy lenses are pushed aside, and the protagonist is confronted with the reality of a morally and physically crumbling society.

The film also presents well the banality of evil. Some of the Nazis are rabid psychopaths, yes. Others are social climbers or hangers-on. And others still are potential victims who hide in plain sight. The film shows you how people will join up in such a movement for all manner of reasons.

But it also takes care to show you that none of those reasons absolve them of the responsibility that they have for the things they have done. None of them are let off the hook. And the film makes no attempt to say that they should be. Only that there is always time and space left to do some good, and that we therefore must do what we can.",dpqt2y

fi3juys,"I enjoyed this film. I think a lot of people don't quite realise how realistic some of these scenes were. I went with my mum, an Austrian whose father was in the hitler youth, and she found it quite difficult to find any scene without children funny. The scenes near the end with the civilians, young and old, are using weaponry to hold off the soldiers? This kind of stuff really happened. Read up on the Volkssturm. Hitler went from a bad joke to terrifying (credit to Taika). When she was growing up, my mum knew people who had lost everyone as children except for a friend or something (or their house), and had been kind of left over like Jojo and Elsa are at the end. Indeed, she was most impressed by Sam Rockwell's character by the end, especially because he risked his neck, first to save Jojo and then also Elsa when he realised there was something wrong. Overall, I was expecting a more Wes Anderson take on the whole thing, this was super dark.  

I felt sure the movie was ending when Jojo and Elsa were looking out of the window, so I was pleasantly surprised that it continued on for some time after. 

Also, I say this as someone who doesn't like Rebel Wilson anyway.

But Rebel Wilson was easily the worst actor in this film. The only one who was not convincing in her role, to me, her lines were badly delivered and the jokes quite poor (I suppose that can also be a weakpoint of the script). The only scene that had me kind of laugh was when she slowly slid herself across the bench. The thing with giving the American soldier a hug... the 18 babies... all that just didn't do it for me.

Captain K saved JoJo's life by calling him a Jew. The invasion took probably what, 3-4 hours? Tops? If JoJo had been called a Jew that morning by a Nazi officer, he would've been killed on the spot. But 3 hours later, it saved his life. That's so wild how quickly everything changed. Great commentary on the fleeting and temporary power of certain ideologies. Definitely need to watch it a few more times.",dpqt2y

What are you all smoking? This movie is fantastic. So heartwarming, charming, funny, poignant. I LOVE black comedies and this movie hits all the right marks. 

The casting is fantastic. The main kid actor who plays JoJo is fucking perfect; as is the kid who plays his best friend. Sam Rockwell as the Nazi general is great too and a great character that changes your perspective on him as the film goes on. And Taika as imaginary hitler. Maybe one of the best comedic characters I've seen this year? Actually not maybe. Definitely. So funny and he just has perfect comedic timing, as you can see when you watch the movie. 

The only role I wasn't completely sold on was Scarlett's, I think she went a little to over the top in a couple spots. Her german accent was also distracting. 

Love the set direction and colour palates the movie has. It definitely feels like Nazi Moonrise kingdom at times. Wes Anderson vibes for sure but I think the humor is less dry than Anderson's stuff. 

The movie definitely takes some dark turns that I didn't expect and they just add to the quality of the film. Taika really understands and appreciates the imagination of kids. I don't think anyone can write from the perspective of a kid as well as he can. 

Loved it. Don't believe the haters. Go in and expect to have a good time. The most adorable nazi movie I've ever seen.",dpqt2y
f761b9j,"The tonal shift 2/3 of the way through was genius. As I watched I worried the movie would stagnate and fall back on comedy to an extent that it forgot its own point. But then we got the double punch of Steven Merchant’s gestapo scene + the shoe scene...
The movie’s last third was significantly more morbid, even if it did include some of the funniest scenes sprinkled throughout (Yorkie’s last few lines were killer)
It takes guts to flip the tone that far in a film, but Taika pulled it off beautifully. It made the feels hit so much harder than expected. I went in expecting to cry laughing, but I wasn’t expecting to be laughing through tears of sadness.",dpqt2y
f778v5p,"Fantastic.

Also, the Hitler-mania footage at the beginning was incredible.  I had never seen that before.  Usually they show you the ultra serious footage where all the Nazis seem like obedient servants/robots for Hitler, and it's hard to place yourself in their shoes.  But seeing the fanfare and *love* they had for him was striking.

Ordinary people being taken advantage of.  They're so bought in, yet they were like anyone else.

Also, zero people in my theater laughed when she said, ""gesundheit"" after Jojo said, ""A Jew"".  It's such a dumb and hilarious joke, and I'm amazed I've never heard it before.  I don't think anyone else caught it though. :(",dpqt2y

fdifhdk,"Loved it, and the more I think about it the more I love it. There's a lot of really clever little touches in there, little flourishes.

&#x200B;

Some bits of it are really cold too, and you kind of don't clock them until you think on them. For example how the Gestapo show up and you realise that it's because they have already hanged Rosie, or they are about to, and they're talking to the boy they've just orphaned and they don't say anything, or do anything related to it, although it's clear by their tone at the end they are aware of this, to the point of laughing about it. They're literally just there to look for a reason to hang him too, and perhaps the arrival of Klenzendorf is the only thing that stops them, not just because he helps with the papers, but because his clear attachment to the boy, combined with the increasingly precarious power of the Gestapo at that point possibly deters them from killing him. That scene is just so damn creepy.

&#x200B;

I know it's not much in the spirit of peace and love that the movie is seeking to create but I really wanted to see the Gestapo lads go to the wall.

&#x200B;

I'm torn about the ending. On the one hand, there is a point there about enjoying the moment, about being alive and that's great and celebrate it. On the other hand, it leaves two young orphans in the immediate aftermath of a battle and I was dying for some sort of reprieve, for a less precarious end. They turn Elsa over to the Americans and she vouches for Jojo maybe, or Yorki's mum takes them in, or something. That street didn't feel safe enough for the little dance. But that's just me worrying.",dpqt2y

f5zrcvp,"I really liked this movie.  I saw it last weekend in a triple feature with Parasite and The Lighthouse, and it was the most fun I've had at the movies in a while.

What I liked: First off, the reveal that Rosie was caught is perfectly set up and is such a fucking gutpunch. I can't think of many movies recently that have a ""Holy Shit"" moment like that. I also think Scarlett Johansson is really good in this. I think her chances of an Oscar nomination are pretty slim at this point but I think she'd be my pick for Best Supporting Actress at this point. (EDIT: It turns out I am wrong about that, Gold Derby lists her as one of the leading contenders). The Sam Rockwell death is another gutpunch moment. I thought Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie were both really good. The Gestapo investigation scene was the best part of the movie for me.  It was funny, it was tense, I loved it.

What I didn't like: Some of the movie just didn't land with me.  Both in terms of jokes and emotional beats, there were more than a few moments when people around me were laughing or reacting and it just didn't do anything for me. One example would be when Sam Rockwell shows up in the battle scene at the end in the outfit he'd drawn earlier. More than a few of those came from Taika Waititi's Hitler.  It feels weird to say ""I didn't like him as Hitler"" but I guess I can't think of a better way to say it.

Overall this is a 4/5 for me. Taika Waititi has yet to really disappoint me, I'll be there to see whatever he puts out next, and I need to finish checking out his older films.",dpqt2y

This movie is so well put together and well acted. It's humorous and at times exceptionally sad, it has a timeless message while not being preachy. It has some great comedic moments and is very tragic at times. And the choice of music especially during the first and last scene is so good.

Then you go online and see that the movie gets trashed by critics and I wonder if they saw the same movie.

fkwiv3h,"I heard this movie was supposed to be a satire about Nazis. Watched it a few hours ago expecting a comedy, well I got that and a lot of feels at the same time.

The movie does a great job of balancing the humor with the seriousness. I feel like this is exactly how a kid raised in that environment would see the war. The jokes are really funny, their are lines that I don’t think is meant to be a joke but how it was delivered just cracked me up. The serious parts of the movie are done so well and was genuinely unsettling to me. For example the part where Jojo finds his mom or near the end when you see the kids at the start of the movies in the middle of the warzone.

One thing that bothered me though was they kept bring up how ugly Jojo gets after the grenade accident, but I honestly didn’t think he looked that bad in the movie but other than that it was a great movie and would definitely recommend to someone who’s looking for a good movie. 10/10",dpqt2y

It didn’t hit me till the drive home, but Klenzendorf ran to Jojo’s house in such a hurry to help protect him and Elsa from the Gestapo.  

Did anyone else think there that Captain Klenzendorf and Finkel had a romantic relationship?  When Rosie and Jojo busted into their office so Rosie could have Klenzendorf could watch Jojo/give him a job while she went to work, it kind of looked like Klenzendorf was feed Finkel some dessert. And then the end with the very fashionable uniforms he was wearing.  It kind of sealed the deal for me.  I absolutely love the character. His final seen had me crying.",dpqt2y
f71cena,"I love Taika and I've really enjoyed everything he's done. My one criticism of his work is that personally, I didn't think the moments of drama where the movie needs to be impactful landed all that well.

Turns out he was saving all of those moments for Jojo Rabbit. There are so many moments in this that hit me like a brick. Elsa coming close to tears over Jojo being an asshole about her fiance, the hanging shoes and Rockwell saving Jojo all were just incredible and were so impactful. But by far the most impactful was when Jojo stabs Elsa. It made me tear up. 

By far my favorite movie of the year.",dpqt2y

One thing we talked about. For a moment, I started thinking that maybe the mother was an imaginary character too, that maybe she was already dead and JoJo was coping with her passing. Mainly because she was so whimsical and the other imaginary character was also quite whimiscal and strange. Then, my wife said that Imaginary Hitler was so whimsical and strange because that's what JoJo knows of love. He knows his mother's whimsical, so the other person he admires as much as his mother- Hitler - has the same personality as his mother.",dpqt2y

f8t7mp6,"I had a pretty visceral reaction to this movie and I haven't quite been able to put my finger on it. I think the comedy, rather than softening the blow of seeing war horrors on the screen, actually heightened it.

For instance, at the end of the movie Fraulein Rahm gives one of the kids a grenade and tells them to give an American a hug. The theatre laughed, I was about to laugh and then my brain caught up with the reality of it (that yeah, that actually happened) and I was just distraught with horror. It felt super intense like my brain was malfunctioning between the moments of absurdity and awful reality.

I haven't been able to tell if Taika intended it this way. When I talked to a couple of my friends they just seemed to talk about the laughs in the movie in a way that actually made me feel kind of sick. I spent a bit of time thinking on this last night and I don't know if this movie is actually supposed to be funny, at least primarily. Based on the movie's pacing I wonder if the jokes are mostly intended to be disarming to make the war realities land that much harder. Critics are talking about how the movie moves between horrific and humorous emotional beats quickly and gratuitously but based on my experience I wonder if that's the point.

If it is, after the reactions of my friends, critics, and the audience I was watching this with, I wonder if Taiki was entirely successful at this. I think I'll probably need to rewatch it",dpqt2y

The scene with the shoes hit me like a ton of bricks. It's so obvious in retrospect, but the light-hearted silliness of the movie beforehand just took me completely off guard.

Sam Rockwell and Yorkie were great. I thought Rebel Wilson was really funny. Scarlett Johannson surprised me. I think Waititi's Hitler was servicable. Very funny, but it never ""elevated"" for me. But oh my lord the two main leads were so *really really* good. I couldn't even say who my favorite performance was, they're all so great. Sam Rockwell had the most interesting character arc I think, and stuck with me the longest after leaving the theater. Yorkie's lines had be dying though. My favorite is the one about the Japanese, who ""to be honest don't look very Aryan to me"".

fahl9oo,"This finally came to the local theater last weekend, which was nice. I really enjoyed it. The humor was great, but incredibly bleak in a couple different ways that is a little hard to describe.

You have Captain K, fully aware that the reich is doomed, but doing his best regardless.  And then on the opposite side you have the gestapo who are so deep into the lies that they believe their own propaganda about Jews.

And then there is the dramatic aspects. The Nazis refusing to give up even when hopeless. Sending children in to die. Continuing to purge anyone suspected of being a traitor even as the allies are attacking.

And finally, Captain K's sacrifice at the end. He could have tried to save himself, to try and explain how he was working against the Gestapo. It may or may not have earned him some small amount of sympathy. At least enough to be treated as a POW. Instead he gave up any chance of that in order to make sure that Jojo would be free.

Additional thoughts:  Archie Yates was great and I hope he gets a lot more work. Sam Rockwell was perfect. Rebel Wilson was actually really funny and not just awkward. Roman Davis was the kind of child actor that never reminds you he's a child actor, which is good.

The German Shepherd joke was a little out of place but hilarious so I don't mind one bit.",dpqt2y

Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen were also phenomenal in the movie. I know Alfie's character was mostly meant to just add humour, and I suppose Sam's as well (at least until the end).

Sam Rockwell has played some great characters in his career, but Officer K has to rank with the best. So many layers to him.

Personal theory: Officer K worked for the Nazis out of no choice, not a resistance fighter (as some are suggesting), had a good heart, rushed to JoJo's home with Scarlet's bike-so probably witnessed her execution.
Also, had sort of a hero's death by saving Jojo.",dpqt2y

I didn't see it coming honestly. And it was crushing. No last words, no farewell, just loss. No music in the scene, no background jokes or anything even remotely happy.

Luckily everyone in almost full showing was completely quiet.

Such a great movie and I'm ashamed to admit I have yet to see any other movie from Taika aside from Thor and this one.",dpqt2y
feh791u,"First off, loved this movie. Its certainly in my top 5 of the year.

Everyone talking about THAT scene and yes while I deffinetly thought it was brilliantly done and very emotionally resonant, I havent seen people talk about my favorite scene of the movie just following.

When Jojo comes home, his Hitler youth knife still in hand walking towards Elsa I was on the edge of my seat. Elsa turning and smiling killed me inside. They've become so close by this point and now she has to retreat back into danger mode once she sees the knife. 

And then Jojo stabs her. Not fatally thankfully. But still, he has all this anger. This sense that he's been betrayed by his new best friend. He wanted her dead before because she was just a jew. Now, Jojo saw this as personal. He wanted to take all his frustration out on her. And when he realize what he's done and just turns and leaves, dropping the knife then himself collapsing on the ground, I was in more tears then with the shoe scene.

The kicker: Elsa going to comfort Jojo after he tries to stab her is not only wholesome but just extremely heartfelt. Rather then be mad at him she instantly forgives him. Because it's something that she would have done herself. And immediately following of them actually being close in the attic and with him putting his head on her shoulder...so damn good. Taika killed this movie both from a writing and directing standpoint 

One more note: Michael Giacchino deserves some love for this score btw. Sooooo damn underrated.",dpqt2y
femkg3x,"Don’t know if this has been mentioned before — Captain K helped Jojo and his “sister” because he empathises with her. He has feelings for Greyjoy, and back then homosexuality was as heinous as being a Jew. He knows how its like escaping from the Nazi so he helps her. 

At the end of the movie, he’s caught alone, Greyjoy’s probably dead. He has no one else, so he sacrifices himself so Jojo can be with his “sister”.",dpqt2y

Probably my favourite movie line from the last couple of years.",dpqt2y
fffkhqy,"This movie gobsmacked me right in the gut. I'm blown away by how funny and heartbreaking it is at the same time. This to me is a perfect anti-war movie, with its themes and messages creatively filtered through the eyes of a 10 year old child. 

If you break down the Nazi ideologies and blind patriotism, you begin to see how absurd and silly all of it really is, and this movie encapsulates all of it so flawlessly.

Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job in this movie.

After watching Jojo, I have a genuine interest in the lives of Germans during the war that do not support Hitler and his ideologies. I want to know how their day to day is like. If anyone has any recco for a good read on this, I'd love to know.",dpqt2y
fgxw55j,"Scarlett Johansson was amazing. She made the movie about motherhood and hard choices. Rosie's ability to sacrifice without a second thought for her son, and her daughter's friend, and maintain a strong and loving relationship through war made me want to be a better mother. 

Sam Rockwell was great. His various layers were all believable in one man. Seeing someone loyal to his country without buying into the propaganda. He had his shallow self-hatred, but a deeper moral core that seemed instinctive which gave him depth.",dpqt2y

f6rmee9,"I have never been in a theatre where everyone was trying not to laugh due to it being seen as a taboo topic to laugh at, but god it was hilarious.

And then it sucker punches you. I thought the tonal whiplash was perfect and needed. It was almost like shell shock.

It’s a shame that critics took so much offense and blasted the film with extremely low scores. Unlike other WW2/Holocaust centered films it actually managed to make me see through the eyes of a young relatable child being fed propaganda. I found it incredible how much of an impact this film had on me. It was a tragedy coated with laugh out loud jokes and great acting.

Probably the best film I have seen this year in theatre.",dpqt2y
f711jvz,"I think one of the biggest laughs I had was the reveal of the clones working in the office, but nobody else in the theater laughed and I haven't seen it mentioned here other than one post waaaay in the middle of this thread. Easily the most ridiculous thing in the movie for me.",dpqt2y

-JoJo

Anyone else catch the similarities in these two scenes? I just spent far too long reading pretty much every reply in this thread and haven’t noticed it mentioned. 

Both of them even said it while kicking someone who isn’t there. 

Anyway, I didn’t think I’d see this movie in theaters because I’ve been watching for it and it hasn’t been anywhere near me. But my usual theater had one showing tonight so I jumped on that. 

If I go into giving my take on it, I will spend far too much time writing a review that nobody will read anyway, because I’m far too late to this thread. But I will say that I loved pretty much everything about it, and can’t think of any flaws after one watch. I also can’t wait to see it again, probably multiple times.",dpqt2y

f858an0,"What an experience!  I went in to this movie thinking I'd get a fun comedy (much like *What We Do In the Shadows* or *Hunt for the Wilderpeople*) and while there was definitely comedy, I wasn't expecting the heavy punches it would throw.  For this movie to jump between the whimsical, carefree world of a 10 year old, to that of an absolutely nightmarish landscape that is Germany in the final months of WWII was both surprising and greatly enhanced the potency of this film.  For instance, ""Go run over and give that soldier a hug"" scene: holy hell!  I didn't realize I could both laugh and be shocked at the same time.  

This movie was an emotionally dichotomous experience and overall, I really enjoyed it.",dpqt2y
f8xk9xh,"I saw this movie a couple weeks ago. It was so good, my favorite of the year. That turn with his mom just punched me in the gut. I thought it was a important enough movie to make my kids see it so I saw it again tonight. Knew everything that was coming, yet still cried three times. I loved watching Sam Rockwell’s character on a rewatch, a lot of little things about him really stood out once you knew his characters final fate.",dpqt2y
f9ymghr,"My SO and I saw this last night and going in he was very skeptical of how this would handle the satirical jab at Nazis without being in bad taste. But when the credits rolled he said “That was amazing.” I think he cried more than I did and I am a shameless movie crier. It’s a really disarming, heartfelt, emotional film. The audience seemed to love it too.",dpqt2y
fb9yc0o,"Finally got to watch this movie, and I absolutely loved it! It was innocent and heartfelt, but at the same time dark and somewhat depressing. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the friendship grow between Jojo and Elsa, and was so happy when >!Captain K saved Elsa's and (later on) Jojo's lives. I was devastated upon realizing that it was Jojo's mother's shoes that were dangling, revealing that she had been hung. At that moment I understood why there were so many prior scenes that focused on her shoes.!< 

Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo was brilliant, what an amazing young actor with a great future ahead of him. Sam Rockwell and Scar Jo were great as well! Overall the film is between an 8.5-9.5/10 for me.",dpqt2y
fbdc0pq,"This is the year of ScarJo. She is here like a force and will be my lock for best actress or supporting actress.

Damn, I never expected that Stephen Merchant could convincingly act menacingly. When he's standing over Sam Rockwell, towering and glaring down to him while having the same kind of mad Nazi energy as The Major in Hellsing.

Taika nailing Hitler's manuerisms. 

This is the best use of Heroes in any film I ever seen.

I loved that almost every small line had a pay off later. Like Hitler telling the story of how he pretended to be dead to surprise his enemy.

Lots of great dark humor but at times I felt that it didn't know whether it wanted to make a joke or do something serious. There was some things that also fell flat like JoJo's love interest in the girl seemed to go no where but just used as a piece to make him think that not all Jews are bad.

Why include JoJo lying about the war and then changing his mind the next second? That felt rushed.

Overall great movie 8.5/10",dpqt2y
fcysfky,Its probably been said many times but Archie Yates looks so much like a young Nick Frost and his character even felt like a Nick Frost character. Great film,dpqt2y
fdoaslq,"Was expecting this to be a full in comedy satire didnt expect the sadness  and seriousness.

Taika Waititi was pretty good as imagined Adolf Hitler lol",dpqt2y
fg072o0,I haven't seen it mentioned yet but Rosie's death is foreshadowed many times when you see her feet at his head level. Once during the pool scene and once before they took the bicycles. Perhaps more times.,dpqt2y
fg42db5,"Man I’m glad I have reddit to explain movies to y dumbass.

I thought that Sam Rockwell, upon seeing the “sister” lie about her age, went and turned in ScarJo and had her hanged.

That’s why Sam and Jojo’s final scene felt so odd to me. I was like “he had his mother killed, why are they getting along?”

But realizing here that they were coming to break the news to Jojo and Sam Rockwell saved them makes it so much better

That being said, How did ScarJo get caught?",dpqt2y
fgf6q6a,"Really enjoyed this movie.

Watched it in a packed theater, there were a lot of laughs and sad gasps. So it seems the general audience likes it!

Just a quick idea: Does anyone else think the imaginary Adolf is also a critique on how groups introduce and control people?

It starts off acting like his best friend, welcoming Jojo. He completely gets him, psyches him up, 'supports him' and appears when Jojo is at his lowest. Then slowly when Jojo realizes the ideologies flaws, it turns on him, threatening to leave him or cast him aside if he doesn't play by the rules. There's even a line from Elsa that Jojo is ''just looking for a club""",dpqt2y
fh1nazn,"A minor thing I wanted to point out that I appreciated (that maybe others have said but I haven't seen it yet in these comments), was the pay-off scene from the ""look a tiger in the eyes"" line. When Elsa is looking at the framed pictures up on the wall, the first one is of a literal tiger but the second one is what was meant by Rosie's line. ""You look a tiger in the eye. And trust without fear."" The tiger she was looking at was the potentially dangerous German family, in which she had to trust without fear. The first picture - the actual tiger - isn't a very real or relatable threat, but the Germans however...",dpqt2y

I loved ""Parasite"" and ""1917"". However, ""Jojo Rabbit"" really delivered that emotional punch I felt was missing from some of the other great films this year.

fmzmh8v,*sighs* I guess JoJo will never forgive the Japanese now,dpqt2y
fgvberu,"There is something I was wondering about but I haven’t seen anyone else talking about it:  

Was JoJo’s face way more fucked up than what we see in the movie?  

Everyone but his mom says he looks hideous, the crazy german lady said he couldn’t go to school because he would scare his classmates, the Jewish girl’s drawing of him presents him as way more scarred, with half of his face and one eye fucked up, he was all bloody when he was taken to the hospital, a fucking grenade exploded in front of him.  

What I’m saying is, the actual scars we see are pretty bland compared to what everyone says of him. Sure, he had a few scars in his face but he was by no means ugly or disfigured as everyone was saying he was.  

The whole point of the movie is that we see it in the eyes of JoJo, so perhaps we were seeing the image he still had of himself in his mind?",dpqt2y
fjtqgy1,"Wow, this was pretty great. The comedy and darker moments are blended together very well, liked the main characters and the humour. Taking the nazi premise and making it goofy as hell is not easy, but it works.",dpqt2y

f7hqzdv,"Perfectly casted. Sam Rockwell is my favorite actor and he did not disappoint here at all. He's great at playing complicated characters. Scarlet Johansson really surprised me here. I know she's popular, but I didn't know she could be silly and that serious at the same time. Waititi was Hitler was hilarious. Everything that came out of his mouth made me laugh, especially ""I was just keeping your bed warm, that's what friends are for!"" This is also the first time I actually laughed at Rebel Wilson. And all of the kids were great. Such an enjoyable movie!",dpqt2y
f7wynxo,"Went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it with my son and man was I pleasantly surprised.   For folks saying it was unfunny, did they come in half way through the movie?  Things got serious fast, but glad they were able to throw in a few tidbits -- thanks Yorki.  One of my favorites of the year.",dpqt2y

f8rca1u,"Really beautiful -- paced so well emotionally. and the acting was superb. what talented kids.2 questions still.1-- HOW MUCH DID KLENZENDORF KNOW? >!He and Finkel rushed into the Betzler house seemingly when Rosie was getting executed (right as the house was being searched) but is there any chance he was part of the anti Nazi resistance? Asking because of the hints about his relationship with Finkel, and how he helped Jojo with Elsa.!<

2-- WHAT'S UP WITH HERR BETZLER? Did Jojo's dad really defect to help the anti-Nazi movement from afar? Did Elsa ever throw into Jojo's face at some point that his dad is a Jew when he calls himself a Nazi, or am I confusing it with a different part?",dpqt2y
f95eefi,"Just finished the movie and let me just say, I'm the last person to be all Oh, you just didn't get the movie if you don't like it (and god knows there have been quite a few movies this year when I was told exactly that). But honestly, if you got offended by this one, you didn't get the joke and it's rather unfortunate how many critics didn't.

This was the best I've ever seen ScarJo and she is said to be even better in Marriage Story. Sam Rockwell was fantastic and as someone who usually can't stand Rebel Wilson, she almost stole the show for me. All child actors were great.

Overall, I'm here for anything ridiculously original and out of the box. The only ones who should be offended by this movie are actual Nazis. One of my favorites this year, together with Official Secrets so I'm just gonna watch them both get ignored by the Oscars.",dpqt2y
fbnaiai,"I just saw the trailer for this in the pre-movie ads for star wars.

fc2kpte,From the opening scenes depicting a comical 'Hitler' imaginary friend I knew it would be a classic. The humour was both subtle and outrageous at times with a very real and emotional undertone and the cast were all perfect for their roles. Another masterpiece by Taika Waititi.,dpqt2y

fcqyi3f,"Saw it today . Best movie of the year . 
But , jokes aside, it was an incredible film . Merchant's Gestapo scene made me genuinely uneasy and the entire (full) cinema was silent .",dpqt2y
fczeo7t,"The first act of this movie is like a v-12 engine cast in comedy gold that takes you from 0-60 faster than you can comprehend one funny moment to the next 

The scene when Jojo actually gets blown up had me laughing so hard because I never saw it coming 

Then when you expect this apparent comedy to brush off the consequences of that kind of moment with a small wardrobe adjustment and an off-handed joke about German grenades, you instead watch that moment affect his whole life. What an intro. What a film. 

On the other hand, while I loved mind-hitler as a literary device I found the humor of the character a little tiresome by the end.

I guess it’s hard to say the movie did anything wrong by making me feel like hitler was popping up where he doesn’t belong and overstaying his welcome. lol",dpqt2y
fd8zfv6,"I loved how it subtly incorporated actual nuances of everyday german life of the time. I wish we'd see more of this care for local culture in high visibility / Hollywood movies - I know its not ""their"" duty to showcase this, but still.",dpqt2y
ff3c47y,Anyone else notice that as Jojo’s nationalism faded he was seeing Hitler less and less? Nice lil metaphor there,dpqt2y
ff68beq,Just saw the movie yesterday and was really impressed. The two kid actors were terrific and Johansson was about as charming as a person could be. Not sure why so many critics missed the mark on the movie.,dpqt2y
ff771ph,"This was sooo GOOOD. Just watched it recently, and I'm sobbing a little bit inside.

Nothing really prepared me for this twisted, darkly comedic satirical masterpiece that Taika Waititi has crafted. The foreshadowing of the shoes and always being untied was brilliant.

The whole thing was delicately handled. I felt he went a bit overboard sometimes, but he did do the whole perspective from the eyes of a 10 year-old child perfectly. 

Great stuff.",dpqt2y
fftcgw9,"I'm doing my best picture watches now and saw this last night.  More than any of the other movies I've seen so far (yet to see 1917, forf v. Ferrari and little women) JoJo Rabbit defied my expectations.  

I probably appreciated the tonal shift more than others.  JoJo's innocence had to die and you were forced to realize that yeah,  this *is* Nazi Germany.  Also, after digesting the movie I realized how awesome Sam Rockwells character really was when he showed up at JoJo's house while the gestapo was there.  He knew what happened and went there to protect JoJo (and Elsa although I'm not sure he knew she was going to be there.)

Honestly, I think this is my personal favorite of the bunch so far.",dpqt2y
fhls222,"The movie has been stuck in my head for nearly a week now. I've watched it ~~twice~~ four times and additional scenes multiple more times. I love everything about it; the acting / actors, the characters, the story, the kind of satire and humour and the fact that it made me go through so many emotions within 100 or so minutes. 

Some of my favourite scenes were the whole pep talk at the start and the Jungvolk camp, Rosie playing her husband and generally the one-on-one moments between Rosie and Jojo, Jojo making up the Nathan's letters for Elsa, Jojo having butterflies in his stomach (very Wes Anderson-y), Elsa's numerous fantastic one-liners and dialogs, Heil Hitlering the boy, captain K's new outfit and him saving Jojo, and the ending dance. Generally the whole movie was just on a role from good and meaningful scenes to the next.

I thought after Parasite I wouldn't get to see a movie I like even more from 2019. This movie might become my favourite movie of all time. 

The movie wasn't popular at all here in Switzerland, it's a shame, many people will probably never see it.",dpqt2y

fijdq05,"Fantastic movie, 10/10, absolutely loved it, have not cried so much at a film before (that I can recall), but it was also so funny, and it was all so good, and I'm so glad that I waited for the DVD/bluray (or whatever) release (rather than downloading a camrip, I mean; the movie was never released in Malaysia so no chance for a cinema and even if there was I would not want to deal with the censorship) because it's a gorgeous film also.

My favourite movie ever? Hm. No, no there are movies that mean more to me, but I don't think they are better movies. This one is great; I think if anyone asked me right now what the best film I've ever watched was, I'd say Jojo Rabbit. But my favourite would probably still be Shaun of the Dead or The Hunchback of Notre Dame because favourites are subjective and best is objective. Anyway, that's a tangent.

Yeah, can't recommend this movie highly enough. Everyone should see it.

I just glanced up at the ratings, what the fuck do you mean 78% on Rotten Tomatoes and fifty-fucking eight on Metacritic? World's fucked; only explanation.

Gosh what a great movie. I'm gonna watch it again for sure.

About halfway through the movie, I kept wondering, “How is Scarlett Johansson not the favorite for Best Supporting Actress?!?! She’s fantastic!”

And then...I realized why...😢 

Despite the lack of screen time, I think that was one of the best things I’ve ever seen her in. That scene with her & JoJo where she’s playing the Dad is in my top 5 favorite scenes of the year! 

Really hope she can continue to play more roles where she can show off her charisma. It’s been tamped down for way too long!",dpqt2y

I always roll my eyes when I read reddit comments like this but I might've never laughed so much in a movie, and I for sure have never cried as much in a movie. Let alone both, back and forth over and over and over again. I'm at a loss for how to describe how amazing this movie was

The humour was on point but the absolute gut punch took me completely by surprise and got the eyes watering. Ending got me properly. A really human story that made me feel something positive where too often I find myself not taking any lasting joy from films.

Obviously with ScarJo getting the nomination today she'll be the focus, but honestly the three main child actors, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson were all so good. I normally don't find Rebel that funny but she had me in stitches in some scenes. Absolutely deserves the screenplay nomination and Taika probably deserved a spot on director nominations.",dpqt2y

Fraulein Rham is through and through a Nazi, evil, she followed every order of the third Reich even if it’s biased as it discriminates her gender, or cruel as she sends children on suicide missions. In the end she died a gruesome death offscreen.

Captain K is loyal to the Nazi, yet he is not completely a bad person, so even though he fought for the Nazi to the end, he still helped Jo Jo and Elsa to the best he can. In the end he sacrificed himself for Jo Jo.

Yorki is as innocent as one can be, completely neutral. He’s not particularly passionate about Nazism, but he doesn’t really have an opinion of his own either, he just sorta followed the flow and became a Nazi because he just so happens to live under Nazi rule. In the end he was spared and harmlessly left the war.

These four people served as “role models” for Jo Jo. Jo Jo started like Rham, a blind fanatic for Nazism, who would kill and pillage for Hitler without thinking about right or wrong. As he encounters difficult situations after difficult situations, like the peer pressure to kill a rabbit, or the discovery of Elsa, his morals started challenging his ideologies, yet he was still able to maintain balance and manage to do both, like Captain K.

After the final battle, Jo Jo met his best friend, Yorki, one last time, a perfect example of how Jo Jo would’ve ended up, other than dead of course, had he just followed the flow and not devoting to either Nazism or his mother’s morals. In the end, after a last bit of struggle, his kindness and love for Elsa overcame Nazism and his pride, he became like his mother, a kind, rational human being who just wants to do the right thing.",dpqt2y

f85ddvc,"I went in expecting “Springtime for Hitler Youth” from watching the trailer, except with more drama; it turned out to be more like “Life is Beautiful.” I liked this movie, but it’s too emotionally touching for me to see again. I was too invested in the characters to not get emotional, even expecting before watching that in a movie like this, *someone* had to die for the movie to stay serious.

Tonally, I don’t like the execution and placement of the scene Jojo defenestrating imaginary Adolf. By this time in the movie, the real Adolf is dead and Jojo has become disillusioned with the ideology he sought acceptance and love in: he has seen the horrifying manifestation of the ideology he so idealised in flesh with the Gestapo visit, the death of his loving mother at the hands of the system he long sought to be a part of, having cemented a bond of affection and friendship with Elsa in the aftermath.

By this point it should be clear to the viewer that the imaginary, whimsy yet propagandistic [Adolf is an extension of Jojo’s imagination and mind](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/cb2c4912-a5ee-40cc-8f5e-12f6f480db66). I could not find it believable that despite all of Jojo’s grief and disillusionment, witness to violence, the death of the real Adolf, etc…there’s still remnants of an imaginary character constructed from propaganda in his head? Whatever humor was in that scene unfortunately did not land or resonate with me because of how inconsistent or dissonant it felt in relation to the rest of the act.

Nonetheless, given how important it is to give some kind of ending to imaginary Adolf for the character development to make sense, maybe it could have been dealt with differently. Perhaps this scene should have been placed somewhere like right after the death of Rosie. Or imaginary Adolf could have been placed as one of the casualties in the aftermath of the Allied attack on the town; if the director wanted to give the character a dark, yet humorous death, that would have been the perfect place in the film to place it, and it would have made more sense in the light of character development.

Some random things I noticed:

I don’t know how deliberate this was, but in the dinner scene where Jojo plays with the bread, Rosie puts on, I think, a jazz record. Jazz was heavily despised by the regime, and in some cases banned, if I recall. A very nice way to accentuate Rosie’s anti-regime orientation.

Imaginary Adolf is wearing an Amerindian headdress in a scene where he’s talking with Jojo behind a window. Perhaps, an allusion to the popularity of [Native Americans in German popular culture at the time?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_German_popular_culture#Karl_May_festivals_during_the_Nazi_period)

[In the trailer, we see an American M10 tank destroyer and other vehicles moving into the town after the Allies occupy the city](https://youtu.be/TxJt02r91L4?t=99). I'm not sure this was in final cut of the film that I saw yesterday. I’m a WWII buff, and I would have loved to have seen this scene in the film.

During the Gestapo house search scene, Elsa (as Inga) says, she’s 17; the document she relies on for her disguise says she was born in 1929. That means the scene would take place in 1946…after the war is over. Was this a way for the audience to see another way how Elsa made a mistake with the identifying papers?

In one scene after the town is taken by the Allies, an American soldier was waving a 50-star flag from a tower…that flag design is from the 1960s. In the last scene, Americans in a jeep go by waving a 48-star flag.

A small nitpick: I watched ‘Allo! ‘Allo! and Hogan’s Heroes a lot, and I’m used to the use of foreign-accented English. The foreign-accented English works for me and doesn’t break the immersion…up until Jojo interacts with the Soviet soldier, who also talks to Jojo in English…despite the presence of Russian dialogue in the film background during the entire scene. In ‘Allo! ‘Allo! accented English is used to stand in for whatever the French and German characters speak to each other, with British English used for comedic effect as a language that no other characters can understand. In Hogan’s Heroes, English and German are used in a regular manner, but the immersion is somewhat lost when Allied characters perform infiltration missions in the heart of Germany, speaking English, or when a scene where only German characters are present speak exclusively in English. The Soviet soldier scene was a bit disbelievable given how unlikely, in my mind, that a German child was able to understand a Russian soldier (unless of course, the English being spoken was also a stand-in for German).",dpqt2y

The hanging scene really hit hard, as well as the aftermath of Jojo’s reaction. Thank goodness they had that scene with his friend accidentally shooting the bazooka soon after because I needed a good laugh after that. The scene with his captain calling him a Jew to save his life was so good.

I think the most powerful scene though is Jojo and Elsa dancing at the end. That was so heartfelt and left a sense of hope in me.

I thought Klenzendorf and Finkel would turn out to be full on resistance members, but it turns out they were just sympathetic to freeing Germany. I'm very happy with that decision. I think it goes to show more of a spectrum of how the war was viewed--not a simple black-and-white issue.

#Major Spoilers Below!

Did anyone notice all of the foreshadowing of >!Rosey's death by hanging?!<

The first was the scene were Rosey is pretending to be both Jojo's father and mother at the same time. The ""father"" says ""Take care of your mother. She's *doing what she can*."" This is a reference to the first gallows' scene, where Jojo asks his mother ""what did they do?"" And she answers ""(They did) what they could."" This foreshadows her involvement in the ""free Germany"" resistance movement and her eventual fate.

The next two instances happen when Jojo is at the indoor pool and when he is taking a walk/bike ride with his mother. Both these scenes have very conspicuous shots at Jojo's eye level with his mother talking to him even though all we can see is her feet from the ankles down. The outdoor scene even has her ""dancing"" in a way that the hanged bodies' feet were ""swinging"".

My wife whispered to me halfway through the movie that she thought Rosey was going to die because she was such a wholesome character, and it wasn't until she said that that I realized why those shots of her feet were in there. I did already catch onto the line in the mom/dad dinner scene, but at that point I was still in denial and thought it was just hinting at her involvement in the resistance.",dpqt2y

It's an awesome and delicious satire of Nazis, but not war - you'll laugh at most Nazi antics, but when it's about War, it generally takes a more serious tone.

There's a LOT of humour.

This movie really made me laugh to **tears** and...

Finally got this in theater where Im too and where to begin?

Such a well acted, charming, heart-breaking, dramadey. I was really curious os Taikia would pull this off and he did in spades. 

All the cast do a remarkable job with it. Everyone pulled their weight.. even Rebel Wilson who I typically cant stand. Ive never really seen ScarJo in much outside her action movies.. but goddamn she was good in this, bringing a warm, humourous turn as Jojo' mother. Im still honestly shook from when Jojo cones across her shoes after chasing the butterfly.. powerf stuff. The whole thing does a great balance of humour, and showing the horrors of WW2. Watiti's Hitler does get a little bit over the top at times but when he turns dark in some of the scenes its great stuff. 

Ive seen some critics complain that it makes some Nazis out to look like ""good people"" and I cam only assume they mean Sam Rockwell's character.. and if they didnt catch he was a resistance sympathizer then I dunno man, they musta been not watching the movie..cause the true blue Nazi characters, were no way sympathetic.",dpqt2y
f787dhv,"I don't know if it was just my theater, but it felt like the audience didn't get any of the jokes that were incredible;maybe it's because it felt like the average age was mid-50s and I live in Texas...

I lost it at the ""a jew - gesundheit"" scene and I'm pretty sure nobody else even snickered. The german shepherd bit went over like a lead balloon as did the clones along with many of the almost too quick to catch moments that were littered throughout. Reminded me a lot of watching Life of Brian with someone who has never seen a python show.",dpqt2y
fhdx4zx,"Here are a few things that i noticed.

1. Jojo's idea of a jew was similar to a child's idea of a ghost or monster. So when he meets elsa for the first time, the scene looks like it was straight out of a horror movie. Elsa with her disheveled hair, slowly clutching the wall, crawling towards jojo. Loved the whole vibe.

2. Captain k was probably not very into the nazi propaganda. He was fighting for his country because everyone else was. Or maybe he was a hard core nazi who was demoted because of the missing eye and from afar, while teaching children to blow things up, he slowly realised how ridiculous and pointless the nazi ideals were and simply became disinterested with time and became an alcoholic.

3. Captain k was probably gay. He respected and knew rosie. He liked jojo. When he found out that rosie was dead, he went in to instinctively check on jojo, not knowing about elsa, of course. He possibly knew that inga was dead. He looked out for jojo and helped the kids that day.

4. LOVED the part where jojo literally kicks hitler out of his window (life).

fhm88hm,"It’s my favorite movie all time, and that’s not a hyperbole.

I put it on yesterday during a 9-hr flight, and ended up watching it 4 times in a row... it gets better with every viewing. Once you know the story, you go back to the beginning and see the characters evolve and interact with each other... it’s so beautiful.  You also obviously pick up on details you may have missed the first time.  If you’ve only seen it once and enjoyed it, I highly suggest watching it again (and again...).

Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance, and I’d even dare to say the same about Sam Rockwell.  The Captain K character is perfectly written; and his final scene with JoJo was more heartbreaking than dare I say even the butterfly/shoe scene.

Shoes/shoelaces are an obvious theme, but upon re-viewing you pick up on just how perfectly it’s executed (the timing, what is being discussed, etc.) when the theme pops up.  Also, there are a ton of brilliant historically accurate inside “jokes” (although nothing about that period was actually funny) that are executed to perfection (the Russians, Hitler’s balls, metal for Hitler, etc.).

Even though Johansson, Rockwell, and the child actors should get the most plaudits for their acting, the whole thing is pulled off by Waititi’s portrayal of Hitler. He plays him with enough sarcasm and style so that you accept the satire of the movie, without getting a feeling that it’s too over-the-top.

To me it’s a perfect film. Heartbreaking, heartwarming, great characters, well-acted, amazing screenplay, etc. etc. etc.  You’re crying one moment, laughing the next... holding your breath with suspense, then exhaling with relief. And even though you kind of have an idea what is going to happen with JoJo and Elsa, from scene to scene it’s not predictable at all.

Jojo finds himself stunned by the confusion around him, when he comes across Captain Klezendorf, wearing the extravagant uniform, aforementioned in the film.

The thing is: what exactly are we supposed to feel with that scene? Although it takes place, as I said before, among the despair and affliction of the war, both cinematography and soundtrack basically show us a moment of wonder, just to get back to that same despair afterwards.

f6y01de,"This movie manages to have an original take on World War 2, which is difficult since there are so many movies set in that era. Can’t remember another movie that showed all the chaos in Germany at the end of the war. Definitely one of my favorites of the year. Beautiful score, beautifully shot, and it just felt very original. Hoping for some Oscars!",dpqt2y
fejikb0,"A very well done satire. I think Taika was poking fun at the actual Nazis, representing them as children for blindly following their contradicting/irrational ideologies without critical thinking. Of course a lot of scenes and lines also align with that idea, which I'm sure many others have pointed out. 

There were so many good one-liners in this film, I had a smile on the whole time, until of course the shoe scene. Such a crushing moment. I think that completed Jojo's character arch where he realised that the Nazis weren't actually the good guys.",dpqt2y

That said, that ending was great, and they found a way to turn their bleak situation into something more fun and hopeful. I loved that Elsa still smacked him for lying. The only thing I wished is if there was music playing on the street as background. Just him and her randomly starting to a dance was a little awkward, but I loved that Elsa and Rosie echoed the dancing for hope.",dpqt2y

It was shot well, and every actor was fantastic. Especially the kids. The way the script delt with the effects of living in a war through the perspective  of a 10 year old was just incredible. 

After watching, I immediately told my wife it would be a crime if Jojo was not nominated for best picture. I was so glad to find out that was not the case.",dpqt2y

f61jze0,This is one of the best movies of the year! The cast top down is amazing and hilarious. The point of the movie really hits close to home as we get into this impeachment fight. It shows that there is life after the worst the world has to offer. Don't listen to snobby critics. They were wrong about Joker and they are wrong about this. See it and judge it for yourself.,dpqt2y
f6vd8q9,"Just got out. I really enjoyed it. I was worried it my be a bit fluffy. I remember when the critic reviews started coming out for this and they almost made it sound like this movie wasn't dark enough. That it almost took light of the subjects. 

It had some dark, soul crushing moments. Not only the death of ScarJo. The scene with the Gestapo while humorous still was full of tension. Also they sent a kid out as a suicide bomber at the end.

After seeing The Lighthouse last week I didn't think I'd see a great monologue so quickly. But Taika sternly telling Jojo to get his shit together was actually pretty scary. Until he spit in the soup and lightly kicked the chair.",dpqt2y

f6s7i5i,"For me the best shot of the film was during the scene>! Jojo finds out his mother died and the houses in the shot seemed to have faces looking down on him. !<To me this was the perfect image of a view of a 10-year-old amidst a horrific situation (tbh I still see cars having faces). I loved the film, and I think that beyond the satire the deeper layers of the film expressed the possible absurdity of ideologies, the belonging and alienation to and from a group, and themes such as prejudices, love and coming of age.",dpqt2y
f71rsdi,"This is probably my favourite ending of the year, so far anyways. Yeah it’s simple, and a little cheesy (very cheesy), but it’s also basically a perfect cap on the film. I read the script last year, and again last month, and I’m really happy it basically lived up to it entirely",dpqt2y
f75pbhs,"Man, I read a script for this last year when it was still floating around the web and as soon as I got to the shoe scene I regretted it. Still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and seeing the reactions from the crowd (pretty sure they had a bigger reaction to that pair of shoes than when Cap lifted Mjolnir).

Definitely noticed how Hitler went from goofy buffoon to nasty dictator as the movie went on.",dpqt2y
f7qnyzt,"Absolutely loved it. Great performances, great plot, great twist that was well forshadowed and paid off. The only possible problem would be too much going on, with Waititi's Hitler and Yorki both playing smaller roles than I expected given the trailers, but honestly I don't think it's even really a problem. I like Yorki as a lighthearted constant in Jojo's life, and it would have had a lot of issues without Hitler, so even if he felt a little redundant by his last scene it was still good overall.

Great movie.",dpqt2y

I live in the Midwest and it took 3 months for this movie to come to a movie theater near me, and only at movie times during the middle of the day so I had to go to the theater immediately after work to see it. I am seeing nothing supporting this but from my point of view it seems like someone is trying to kill this movie. I don't know if anyone else noticed this but it has my completely confused.",dpqt2y

fgbvcjj,"I just finished watching it at the cinema. Taika's nth homerun with a child lead. Although I like Hunt, What We do in the Shadows, and Thor Ragnarok much more. Jojo has its unique charm that I myself think that this film is much much more serious than the three I mentioned. I even compared it to Inglorious Bastards, from its theme up to a strongly recognizable cast, although all of the supporting roles in this film felt almost like a cameo. 
&nbsp;
 
My expectations were high on Scarjo's performance due to her numerous nominations, I was satisfied but all I think about after watching is her character's screen time. The emotional attachment was cut short, it felt very short that the emotional impact of her death didn't fazed me that much. Still a good performance.

feho68n,"What is the story with Jojo's sister?! 

So Jojo's sister is dead and had been for maybe up to 3 years. Jojo said, after Elsa pretended to be her (Ingrid?) in front of the Gestapo, that her passing wasn't widely known.

How did she die? How did she get buried, and how did Jojo and Rosie grieve without people finding out? Why was her passing kept secret?

Would love hear any theories. My main theory is that it was just a plot device so that scene could be very intense. Which would be a shame, I want there to be a good story behind it.

Taika Waititi Explain!

Edited: grammar",dpqt2y
ffdsvo5,"It reminded me a lot of an earlier Taika Waititi film, *Hunt for the Wilderpeople.* The trailers for that film gave the impression that it was a quirky Wes Anderson-esque comedy about a kid going on the run. And the actual film... well, it was a quirky Wes Anderson-esque comedy about a kid going on the run, but it also so much more than that. It was a surprisingly intelligent and emotionally mature film that resonated a lot with me... which I never would have expected from the trailers.

And *Jojo Rabbit,* from the same director, is much the same. The trailers sold it as a quirky satirical Nazi comedy, and for the first fifteen minutes or so, that's what it was. But then the film took a hard left turn, and become more a drama than a comedy. There's still humour in the film, but it's humour that's been filtered through a dramatic lens to create a moving, intelligent and meaningful story. And I never would have expected that from a film with a premise like this.

This movie might not be for everyone. Their are some pretty jarring tonal shifts, and at times I don't think all the elements meshed well together. It wants to be a quirky comedy, a deliberately offensive satire, and a sweet romance story about a kid having a crush on an older girl. Sometimes it doesn't juggle these three elements so well. But, to quote another 2019 film, it's the pursuit that's meaningful, and *Jojo Rabbit* has a lot to say and it's just earnest enough to make it work.

Highly recommended.",dpqt2y

fglhw7h,"Really amazing film. Tricks you into seeing the world through the lens of a child, slowly coaxing out your imagination and innocence, just to drop the reality of WWII on you and shatter you right alongside JoJo. I don't think I stopped crying from [obvious scene] all the way until the film finally gave me some comfort with a quote that is just as beautiful as the film.

> Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.    
> Just keep going. No feeling is final.

Words I really needed, to be honest, and ones that really shaped the afterglow of JoJo Rabbit in my mind. This film, and this quote, will stick with me for a long time.

I rolled my eyes and then he added:They're also used as a symbol for hospice.

Apparently they're also used as a symbol for the spirit.",dpqt2y
fh16s6f,"I really liked this film, thought it wasn't as funny as some of his previous work but it had a lot of heart. 

Davis is undeniable and a perfect pair of eyes as Jojo. But Yates as Yorki really stole it for me with a lot of great lines and just being insanely cute, loving the paper like uniform.

The supporting cast were pretty good but fairly under used and hoped for a bit more Allen.

But my far and away my favourite character was Rosie. I never really considered Johannson as an amazing actress until recently. She was fantastic in her scenes but my favourite probably being the dinner scene where she acts as Jojos dad. Also the bit where she's trying to sneak into the house and ends up doing the robot. 

My sister already told me she dies so I knew it was coming but I loved the execution of it. Waititi is one of my favourite directors and I'm glad he took a backseat in the film. After the trailers I thought he would be more prominent but he appeared enough to not remove focus from the rest of the great cast.",dpqt2y

I knew this movie was going to change my assumption of it when Scarlett Johanson and Jojo were looking at the ""traitors"" who were hung.

This one is really something special.  It played really well for my general audience, too.  It got just as many laughs as Good Boys, which was very crowd pleasing.  On top of that, I heard audible gasps many times and one lady was crying HARD at a certain scene.  I figured I would love it, since I'm a big Taika fan, but I'm happy to see that most everyone loves it.  The criticisms about shifting tone are also unwarranted, in my opinion.  It balances wildly different tones better than I've ever seen.  I feel like a proud parent gushing about this movie.",dpqt2y

They did a great job with marketing this as an ""anti-hate"" comedy, but you'd still think some people would be butt-hurt about how much ""Heil Hitler"" is said, or anything else.

The side characters were all great too. Sam Rockwell, Stephen Merchant, Alfie Allen, Rebel Wilson were perfect for their roles, and the kid who played Yorki was hilarious. And Jojo and Elsa were really great as well.

being kids was to show that most 18 year olds at them time were basically still kids at heart. Just a theory, but he got hurt in basic training and received medical discharge. He was still in the military and worked a desk job. A couple things that made me think this. 

1.) His mom was worried about him being a blind fanatic. If he was a kid I feel like his mom would be able to reason with him especially because of Elsa's connection to his sister. But if he was an adult he'd be more inclined to be set in his ways and report his mother. 
2.) The Germans took him seriously about Elsa being his sister when they searched the house. Something that serious they wouldn't let go with the word of a 10 year old.
3.) Elsa and JoJo were just left alone after Jojo's mother was killed.
4.) There was implications that Elsa fell romantically in love with JoJo despite the 8+ year age difference. This would make sense if JoJo was an adult.
5.) Jojo's friend had a weapon in the end, and it was implied he died. 
6.) It was implied that the only thing keeping the allies from killing JoJo was the officer saying he was a Jew. If he was 10 I find it very hard to believe that he'd be shot on site, or that anyone would be worried about him being shot by a firing squad.

It's a story about a boy who blindly hates something and wants to fit in with a club. He will lie, he will do stupid things, he will hurt himself just to fit in.... The fact that this is a parallel with many people today is so very important to understand. Our modern society just hates things for no reason but if you sit back and get to know things, if you just do research you'll learn maybe you shouldn't be hating them... You might even like it.

I related to this boy so much. When I was 10 years old my mother died and just made me cry the whole second half. I was disfigured when I was a kid on my body. I wanted to fit in but I actually didn't. I found my own path. This definitely punched me in the gut making me laugh and then cry literally 30 seconds later. This is not why I liked the movie I listed my reasons above but it's a simple msg that I don't understand why people don't get.

Roman Griffin as young Jojo was good, Scarjo did well with her role and so did Thomasin Mcenzie as Elsa.

fhr4dj7," 

So I just saw Jojo Rabbit and I have a pseudo-theory that I wanted to share, even though I don't think it is actually correct. (I've never read the book btw, I watched the movie an hour ago so this theory would probably change on my second watch).

Basically, it's about the actual moment when Jojo meets Elsa (the hidden jew). In the first time they supposedly meet, she is wearing dirty clothes and seems to be very aggressive. So far, she seems to be just like what Jojo would expect from a jew. In the scenes where JoJo and Elsa talk, Elsa portrays jews to be a bit like demons and monsters. This can be explained by her mocking JoJo and going along with the stereotypes that exist about jews. However, it can also mean that Elsa is just an imaginary jew (imagined by Jojo) and that's why she has all the characteristics that JoJo would expect from a jew. There is even a scene where Jojo tells Elsa to draw the place where jews come from and she draws Jojo's face, mentioning that they live in Jojo's head (she even draws a very deformed head, which is what JoJo thinks his face looks like, even though it doesn't actually look like that).

In every scene with just Jojo's mom and Elsa, Elsa is always wearing different clothes to the ones she is wearing when she is with Jojo. In the mom scenes she's wearing normal clothes and seems to be much more innocent (meaning that Elsa is not actually the agressive and dirty clothed jew that Jojo imagines her to be).

However, this is not to say that Elsa and Jojo never meet, because I think they do in the ""routine inspection"" scene. This is the first time when we actually get to see a scene where Jojo and Elsa are in the same room, along with other people around them. This means that she is in fact a real person, just not the exact same person that JoJo imagined (she is wearing the same clothes that she wore in the scenes with Jojo's mom, which, again, are much more normal and clean than the ones she was wearing in the Jojo's scenes).

So according to this teory, this is the first time they meet. They don't really introduce themselves because he feels like he knows her from his imagination and she feels like she knows him from hearing him talk to himself outside of the secret compartment.

I guess there are some holes in this theory but as I've said before, I don't actually think it is real, I just thought it would be an interesting sub-plot to show the difference between what kids in germany thought jews were like and what they were actually like.",dpqt2y

f5zd61k,"As the movie was playing out I had a hard time figuring out the tone of it all. Ya know like it'd be cute one moment, Mel Brooksish funny the next, sometimes deadly serious, sometimes felt like Moonrise Kingdom sometimes felt like La Vita Bella. It was an odd mix. But in the end I was glad they had stuck with that mix even if during the movie I was puzzled by some of the shifts, because I really loved the ending. 

There are some really fun performances here. Sam Rockwell is always great but this seemed like he was having an especially good time, JoJo and Elsa were really great as was Yorki. Scarlett was also given a really great character to work with and even though I wasn't sure she was nailing the tone she had one of the best scenes in the movie that she was great in. The looking into the tiger's eye scene. Side characters like Rebel Wilson, Alfie Allen, and Stephen Merchant are always welcome as well. 

I mentioned Moonrise Kingdom earlier and I felt like that was a heavy inspiration for this. Not just with the aesthetic of the scouts and the relationship between the short scout and the taller girl or whatever. It was in the shots, too. Maybe Anderson just totally owns any sort of European period piece made for American audiences, but the way Taika was framing shots and using the physical comedy was very Anderson-esque and I think it was an interesting step in a direction for his filmmaking. Maybe it was the satire that made it a little more fantastical but this definitely feels more ""out there"" than Wilderpeople, which I'd say is the next closest movie to JoJo in his filmography. 

While it was a pretty funny movie, I wasn't sure all of the comedy was landing. I think easily the funniest bits were when Taika was on screen. The thought of a child's idea of Hitler, eating unicorn for dinner and saying ridiculous things, was really great. But he's actually a pretty minor character. We spend a lot more time with JoJo, Elsa, and the mom. All of whom were great, but I felt at times that with balancing so many different tones, from the satirical comedy to the coming of age to the fantastical, not every scene was hitting home runs and sometimes I felt like the shifting was a bit jarring.

Sorry I'm using the term ""tone"" so much, but that was the main thing on my mind the whole time. It was so ambitious in that aspect and I think it juggled it all well but it was a big order to fill. 

At the end of the day I was feeling a solid 7, but the ending kicked it up to an 8/10 because I just really loved the final shot of the two kids subtly dancing in their freedom. Freedom from oppression and from an ideal they didn't truly believe in. I think that ending really tied the room together and in that one shot of two kids dancing while the streets are being cleaned of Nazi propaganda nailed the tone of the whole thing perfectly.

But for me it's Archie Yates and Rebel Wilson who really stole the show every time they popped up into the story. They could have led this whole thing. Amazing.

The twist really got me because I was watching the movie and thinking ""it's not realistic that Jojo refuses to snitch on his mom because it happened all the time that children snitched on their parents"", but then while I was concentrating on that I didn't see it coming that his mom could get caught by other means!

Only downside is this whole boy-falls-in-love-with-girl thing which is weird. Granted I'm not a boy, but when I was 10, I saw 17-year-olds as way older.

Both movies use humor to confront the horrors of the Second World War, and depict a lens through which a child grapples with politics, racism, nationalism, genocide. I think the child actors in this movie were exceptional, and Thomasin McKenzie in particular shines. The scene in the town square when Jojo learns his mother's fate was heartbreaking, but like some reviewers, I felt the movie didn't live up to its full potential. The Nazis were portrayed as buffoons, and their antisemitism exaggerated to the nth degree, but I feel it might have been more effective to show either a) a gradual descent into chaos, or b) some subtlety and nuance in the depiction. Essentially, the Nazis were too unbelievable, and aside from the scene with Stephen Merchant's character, we never take them seriously.

f5zkr4z,"I was only mildly interested by the trailer since although it was funny and had some fantastic set and costume design, it seemed to be bit hokey and one-note.

But I ended up liking it much more than I thought. It’s not a straight up satire as it does have some very dramatic and serious scenes to give you a heads up. I think this was needed in order to give the subject matter some respect and an appropriate level of seriousness. These scenes are some of the best in the film and elevate it as a whole. 

Although I do think he could’ve balanced the tone just a bit better and held back on a few jokes so as to not undercut the drama, specifically towards the end. To give a mildly spoilery example, the funniest scene in the trailer with Yorkie and the explosion comes at a very awkward time in the film. It’s not as egregious as Thor: Ragnarok’s overuse of humor though, so I appreciated that.

I think pretty much all of the cast did very well. Particularly impressive were the kids. But I do think the imaginary Hitler character was underutilized. There are long periods of time without him where you kind of forget about him so it makes that storyline feel a bit weak and almost unnecessary. Not sure if they had to cut a lot of it out or what but as it stands in the movie, he weirdly felt like he had very little presence.

The production and costume design were top knotch. It felt accurate enough but colorful enough to match the varying tone the movie needed and the cinematography has a whimsical charm to it with framing very reminiscent of Wes Anderson films. 

Overall I found it pretty funny which goes a long way in making you care about the characters so when things do get serious, it packs a punch even if the tone is uneven at times. It may not be a super sharp satire bringing a ton of depth and insight, but what it lacks in edge it makes up for in heart.",dpqt2y

fhdwrhj,I have a jojo rabbit theory that I’m sure will be disputed. In the entire film none of the other characters seem to make reference to or acknowledge his presence. What if yorki was an imaginary character. Think about it. Rewatching the movie i couldn’t seem to find yorki mentioned by any characters other than jojo and the same way he fantasized hitler being his imaginary friend maybe he fantasiced about having an imaginary best friend in the form of yorki aswell because yorki also only shows up during difficult times in jojo’s journey,dpqt2y

f68qmnw,"Looking at the lukewarm critical reception for this film, I really think this film will be completely re-evaluated in 5-10 years. I thought it was kind of tonally inconsistent and a misfire until we got to the third act, which completely changed my feeling about the film. I've got to say, the final part of this film was the most moving thing I've seen in the movie theater all year. While I was initially cringing at anything I thought to be an easy jab at Trump, I think this movie is a lot more than that. 

Taika continues to write kids better anyone else out there. None of the ""sentimental' parts in the final scenes seemed fake or hokey, and given the lighthearted first three-quarters of the movie, everything was set up so well that everything felt true to the characters.",dpqt2y

This is the kind of movie that will be a hit or miss. The premise is funny and the movie has its moments, but once the Nazi jokes start getting old, the movie does lose some of its charm. It has some scenes that are painfully unoriginal (the last confrontation scene with ""Hitler"") and fails to dwell long enough in certain moments. I am directly talking about the scene between Jojo and Elsa after Jojo finds out about his mother - I wanted some more time there between the two of them. But had ""Jojo Rabbit"" done that, it would have been a very different movie.

Great performances all around from Scarlett Johansen, Sam Rockwell, and Archie Yates. If they ever do end up doing another Lord of the Flies movie, Yorky (Archie Yates) would make a great ""Piggy."" For some reason I couldn't shake that thought throughout the film.",dpqt2y

I'm sorry, but a universe in which Scarlett Johanssen is executed by the Nazis, orphaning her 10-year-old son is not a world in which Rebel Wilson's cartoon character can actually be a person who is in power.

Also, this is the first movie I've seen in memory that features a ""child suicide bomber joke"", and hopefully it'll be the last.

Sam Rockwell's character was pretty well played until he became Liberace.

Stephen Merchant was a the rare highlight that I think nailed the intended tone perfectly, but I was already a fan so I might be biased.

fdc8clb,"Late to the party as I just got out of a viewing and am also shocked at some of the reviews, but also not surprised considering how many left-wing rags like the Guardian. To be honest, it feels like these reviewers watched the first half of the movie and then walked out, considering they complain about not enough detail was given about the horrors of the war.

Besides the obvious butterfly scene, there was the tenseness of the papers scene, Jojo and his mother watching the teenagers who left for the frontlines early in the movie return, as well as a good few heartbreaking anecdotes from Elsa. Not to mention the final war scene is horrific, watching all the child soldiers go to their deaths, especially when, as much as it was slightly comedic, Rebel Wilson's character strapped a grenade to a child and told him to go run and hug and American soldier.",dpqt2y

f6cogn0,"This is the most profound thing I've ever read that contains the term ""yeeting"".  Well done!",dpqt2y
fdps9xi,"I think the other thing to highlight, is that imaginary adolf is kinda Jojo's father replacement.

His dad is gone, he needs/wants something to replace that person. So he's picked the most important person in the country, unforunately shitler has some pretty shit opinions, but when you have that unformed worldview like you mention, you end up taking on the beliefs of you parental figures.

So with hitler as the substitute father figure, he ends up buying into beliefs that would make hitler happy. Because he want's to make his father happy.

And without anything to make him question those beliefs, he has no reason to push back against his father figure in the way a boy might. But as he develops his interactions with Elsa, there is a greater separation between him and his hitler father figure.

Which culminates in the rejection of hitler, especially once he knows he's dead because he can't be a father figure then either.",dpqt2y
f6rmhpn,"> To me Waititi is saying that Nazi-ism and other worldviews based on massive generalizations and hatred of those who are different than oneself are immature and childish.

A total of two Nazis are redeemed in the story, one of whom is ten years old. >!The other one gets shot.!< We're asked to sympathize with a child, not a nazi.

The novel *Every Man Dies Alone* is great for this. 

Published in 1947, it looks at a really wide and interesting range of everyday war-era Berliners. The characters range from ardent Nazis, to fence-sitters and skeptics, to active resistance members. Interesting class perspectives as well. 

There's also a movie, but it's poorly reviewed and my impression is that it just looks closely at the ""main"" characters and leaves out at lot of the others.",dpqt2y

He was also good friends with Rosie as he allowed her to kick him in the balls without reprisal and earlier commented how she was gonna kill him after the grenade incident. He also seemed very fond of jojo himself and dashed over on his bile in an attempt to protect him which he also did by calling him a jew at the end forefieting his own life in the process.

I think that Rosie and K had a very good, friendly relationship and that he might even known something about Elsa or Rosie's anti-nazi tendencies.

When I left the theater I thought that Captain K. was actually cooperating with Rosie and the resistance because:

- The scene here the kids are burning books. Captain K. is clearly not enjoying it.
- I figured that Rosie's attitude towards Captain K. was to cover up that they were indeed friends or at least working together.
- Capt. K covering up for Elsa
- The scene where Stephen Merchant (Gestapo) is towering over Captain K. as if to show that Gestapo is on to them. This doesn't explain why Captain K. didn't get hanged if he indeed was part of the resistance.

Captain K wanted to protect Jojo from the same fate so he got there as soon as he could. I also think that the bike was the one Scar Jo was riding earlier in the movie.

They weren't the type to go AWOL, as proven by the scene where we see both of them fighting (with their new uniforms too)

_______

So in terms of chronology:

- ScarJo in custody, possibly already dead.

- Merchant Squad goes to house, as she's deemed a 'traitor'

- Rockwell & Allen also try to go to the house to tell the kid and/or to comfort him if he knows - but Merchant Squad got there first.

- Inspection happens, Rockwell vouches for both of them despite piecing everything together.

His ability is limited by a bunch of circumstances (including his sexuality and the fact that he was a man with military experience), so his version of rebellion isn't the same as someone like Rosie, who won't be pressed into direct military service and whose existence isn't inherently a crime.  He's more passive.  He subtly refuses to encourage Jojo's antisemitism, he ignores and diverts the enormous red flags Jojo is throwing up everywhere by talking about all the hypothetical scenarios involving talking to/hiding/turning in a Jew, and he knowingly protects Elsa.  Even then, he still states that he admires Rosie for being courageous enough to be ""an actual good person,"" implying that he (and the movie) doesn't let himself off the hook for prioritizing his own survival over taking more direct action.

fhdkxrq,"It's complicated. Overall, one of the film's messages is that you can love your country/be a patriot, and still refuse war, wether it is fighting or denouncing Jews that you can't abide to.

The Captain is a patriot, a fighter frustrated by his situation, but also gay. Flamboyant gay. He can't get out of the closet in Nazi Germany in the 1940's. He also refuses to denounce Elsa when he has Inge's papers just under his nose. They are both victims of the regime and can both be deported in concentration camps, as he knows it.

The only moment when he can show his true colors is during the final fight. I think this was supposed to show us the character embracing everything that makes him, a patriot, a fighter, an homosexual, a desperate man. He's gonna die either way : either as a gay man in Nazi Germany, either as a Nazi if the Allies win. So he decides to take control of his final moments of glory with his lover.",dpqt2y
fhfy2bb,"I think it had the same mood as Titanic’s String Quartet. (But with a little more comedy).

Everything is chaos, people are dying, it’s just absurd to stay and play music with your friends. But it’s just an acceptance of death and you chose to go out on your own terms. Playing your music with your friends.

Captain K and Finkle did the same. They were “out and proud” fighting for their country, with the person they loved.",dpqt2y

No general in 1943 Berlin is  going to cross check a family thoroughly that was displaced by the war unless they knew the family.",dpqt2y
fg2nta0,"I think it's more that people forget. This was still a time when children can pass away quite suddenly. And with all the commotion with Hitler and the war, it wouldn't be the first thing on people's minds.

Also the Gestapo guys don't seem like locals, or particularly familiar with the household. It seems like a cursory inspection after an execution, to see if there is further info on the resistance. They have four more house visits that day.

It should have been clear when the next transition was to Jojo's bedroom with all the Nazi posters, and him in his uniform excited for camp, talking to his imaginary Hitler friend...

But there's stuff in it that's hard to watch and laugh at, or could be.  Hearing the ridiculous anti-Semitic rhetoric repeated ad nauseum *and treated as truth* by (even obviously ignorant) characters. The constant Heil Hitlers. Elsa having to join in on it. Etc.

Onto the movie. The movie was well made and wasn't lazy therefore you won't get complaints from the vast majority of people. It transitioned well from being a more lighthearted comedy to something more serious and heart wrenching. 

I don't see that many people calling railing against good works. It's Always Sunny while seen as an edgy show, it generally is pretty well received.

Forced enlistment of citizen brigades known as the Volkssturm were used to defend cities much like what happened in the movie. Also, the Red army was especially brutal to German civilians and captured soldiers as they rolled through eastern Europe and into the German heartland, so the idea that Red army soldiers would execute a child wearing a German army uniform is totally believable.

I thought Scarlett was actually exceptional in the film, and the depiction of her loss by focusing on her shoes was truly moving. The following shots of the windows staring down on the town like the ever-watching eyes of the Third Reich were nice and ominous. But her death and its aftereffects aren't given room to breathe, and I kept wondering what would have happened to an orphaned kid during that time. It's like Taika couldn't wait to get back to the more lighthearted romance of it all, which he did a great job with, but I felt like he had the opportunity to explore something more emotionally rich, then went another way.

Other than that, I had a blast watching this film. The Wes Anderson influence is definitely strong, and I also noticed it to a lesser extent during Wilderpeople. It's clear that Taika adores his films. Their senses of humor are very different though. There's a manic energy to Taika's comedy, whereas Wes is more deadpan. There were tons of great jokes, but the visual gag about those purebred Aryan clones needing a walk was as disturbing as it was hilarious.

Jojo rabbit is based on a book called ""caging skies"", the difference between the two being that in caging skies there isn't any imaginary hitler friend, cute nickname, some cute little dance and is just a heart wrenching tale that slaps you in the face with an aluminum bat. In the book, jojo's crush on elsa is less adorable and is a very ugly obsession, which only gets worse and worse as Jojo grows into a young adult (unlike the film, that takes place in a few months, the book's premise goes through years). When the war ends, Jojo tells Elsa that germany won as a way to not lose her, and keeps her hostage. In the film, it sort of plays that way, but the lie doesn't last long as Jojo takes Elsa outside and reveals she's free, just before the credits roll. The key word is *sort of* as there is no revealing until much much later, because where the film ends, is merely the middle point of the book. In the following years, Jojo keeps Elsa hostage, feeding her the lie and unnecessarily puts them at constant risk of dying of starvation. To make it all short, they start to hate eachother as time goes on, they fight, Jojo reveals the truth as a ""joke"" and then Elsa leaves, the end.

f702jwp,"I interpreted it as her following what she truly believes in.

The whole movie we see Jojo and other members of Nazi Germany doing what they feel they are supposed to do. Jojo is 10 years old and spends the whole movie trying to become a soldier even though he clearly doesn't fully believe the Nazi ideals, he just wants to belong and fit in. You can see even in the end when the cause is lost and hopeless Fraulein finally gives him the uniform and gun he's wanted through the whole movie but Jojo is finally so disillusioned with the entire cause and scared that he turns around and runs away instead.

The overwhelming majority of the characters in the movie are ""Doing what they can"" i.e. just trying to blindly follow their nation into the fight without stopping to question why it exists. There's even a scene at the end of the movie where one of the characters (I forget who) lists the countries closing in and fighting against Germany and it's pretty much the entire world. Yet instead of questioning why everyone else in the entire world is against Germany, he concludes they must all be evil wretched baby eaters and monsters.

So Scarjo handing out the papers is, I feel, an important scene because it shows the quiet acts of resistance that exist in Germany. It's one of two or three times in the entire movie (the other one being Captain K) where we see someone outside of Jojo question the war effort and stand up to the personality cult of Hitler. And it falls much in line with Scarjo's beliefs and ideals, her ""free spirit"" if you will.

It's very odd for me to have this love/hate relationship with bad endings as everything I write seems to have a horrible ending. But really deep down I want that fairy tale to make all the bad feelings go away.  

For me, Jojo Rabbit was a great mix of both. I was hurt but then I was happy. I might have to bump one of my top 50 movies for this one.",dpqt2y

[Go to the Limits of Your Longing](https://onbeing.org/poetry/go-to-the-limits-of-your-longing/)


God speaks to each of us as he makes us,   
then walks with us silently out of the night.

These are the words we dimly hear:

You, sent out beyond your recall,   
go to the limits of your longing.    
Embody me.

Flare up like a flame   
and make big shadows I can move in.

Let everything happen to you:    
beauty and terror.    
Just keep going. No feeling is final.    
Don’t let yourself lose me.

Nearby is the country they call life.   
You will know it by its seriousness.

Give me your hand.

fhsi3kw,She's handing out propaganda (when Jojo's in the red robot suit he picked one of those paper up),dpqt2y
fht0z23,She was furtively working for The Resistance.,dpqt2y
ficcypb,"If she was working for the resistance then why didnt they kill her son JOJO as well?  

Also why was Sam Rockwells character sympathetic and not jew kill crazy like he should have been?",dpqt2y
fiphr36,I kind of thought that she was found out after Jojo started speaking of his book to those guys as they were questioning him pretty specifically for his source.  Not sure if that led to his mom getting questioned and ultimately found out but it seemed awfully coincidental. On the other hand she really wasn't very low key on the whole dropping off pamphlets task either if Jojo was able to stumble upon one so maybe she had become careless and complacent with her routines.,dpqt2y

f6e6kif,"I was really hesitant to see this movie, as a Jewish person who still remembers all the bullshit Borat stirred up for years. Making a satirical comedy about Hitler is delicate work...

At the end of the day, though, I didn't find this to be a movie about a kid whose imaginary best friend is funny Hitler. I took is as a movie about how we identify and relate to people different from ourselves, and how we process the identities of ourselves and the people around us. Nazi Germany was a convenient backdrop for that analysis that could have been neutral at best, but the addition of some of the other characters and the way they were handled (Rockwell's and Wilson's in particular) towards the end of the movie added context that would have been lost in a pure comedy.

There really aren't any full-blown Nazi characters who get a free pass in this movie and come out looking like good guys or pure comedic characters. Even Rahm strapping grenades to kids makes sure you can't look at her as just a funny side character.

So I don't even think that the movie was necessarily pointing out the absurdity of Nazi Germany at the time. I don't think the movie was really about Nazis at all. It was about how we see other people and how important it is to challenge our worldviews and our assumptions about other people.",dpqt2y
f6almx2,Why do you feel the need to single out Jewish film critics?,dpqt2y
f6cytmj,">  but the whole goofy Hitler thing stops being funny halfway in.

To be fair, Hitler became increasingly less goofy and more desperate/threatening as the film went on. The movie was about what happens when your ideals clash with reality, and what you'll choose to do. Jojo saw his ""idealized"" Hitler and his insane rhetoric about the dehumanization of the Jews become more and more at odds with the reality of his Jewish friend, and in the end he kicked his ideals out the window and settled in reality.",dpqt2y

f74etnp,"He says something in almost every scene he's in, it's all just mainly inconsequential stuff. Like he yells ""No stabbing"" for the intro of Captain K, responds to the effect of ""Yes a book would make things a lot easier"" when Jojo asks Captain K about Jewish people, says he feels like a fool when he brings in the German shepherds, etc.",dpqt2y

f62cw2d,"The movie cannot avoid this so called ""infantilization"".  It is supposed to be from the perspective of a 10 year old boy.  How else is the protagonist supposed to see the Holocaust?  The character would have no knowledge of the gravity of the Holocaust, nor would he be able to understand it.  

I saw the movie as everything being seen through the lens of a child.  The silliness and goofiness of it all were part of that, not to mention the caricature of Hitler as portrayed by Waititi.",dpqt2y

f837e8x,You’re not wrong.  It was insulting garbage,dpqt2y
fhb2tfd,"Only just seen the movie recently and was going through the discussion thread, but it does strike me as a bit odd and hypocritical that you agree with Guy Lodge but then you say Jojo Rabbit reminds you of better more heartbreaking movies, and then you name Life is Beautiful which critics consider extremely mediocre as well and criticise it for also infantilising the Holocaust.",dpqt2y

f872dek,Lol I noticed this too.,dpqt2y

f6hiq3z,Eh. I preferred Hunt for the Wilder people but I would put it over Thor Ragnarok. The Asgard scenes really dragged and didn't mesh well with the Sakar stuff. Still a great film but Jojo was better.,dpqt2y
f6cmqp8,"Dude you need to get your empathy gland checked out, it's broken.",dpqt2y
f62bbqr,He was so afraid that she would leave him all alone...,dpqt2y
fgy4iht,"1. Sam Rockwell's character was a good example of the people who were serving in the German army under Nazi power, but who never bought into the propaganda. He was bitter and jaded, but not hateful. Jojo mentioned learning about Jews and when Rosie was hanged he probably put it together that there was one at the house. His instinct was to protect Jojo, and when he got there, he improvised. He was both a loyal soldier who fought other soldiers, but there were some things he risked himself for.
2. Jojo saw his mother distributing the fliers, and when he found her in the square, he looked around at the houses with windows that looked like eyes. I think that was basically to indicate that her neighbors had turned her in after seeing her distribute the flyer. The Gestapo would have killed Elsa and Jojo if they knew about her. They were searching desks and papers for anti-Nazi fliers, they weren't expecting Elsa. 
3. Jojo was a good person who fell for propaganda without truly knowing what the ideation meant. Despite his personal growth, Jojo still believed innately that the Nazi party was good. Seeing his mother's dead body left him devastated by grief, shock, and anger. He reacted the way many people do when their loved one is taken from them. They look for someone to blame. His mind won't let him accept that he was wrong and his heroes are really the villains, so he regressed to a 'safer' belief. As a boy camping with Yorki, he vowed to kill a Jew if he met one. He clings to this belief that Jews are the reasons bad things happen and that it's their fault his mother is dead. He lashes out at her because he is in pain, but he his nature is not to kill, so he just breaks down,",dpqt2y
fh1sx42,"I think Rockwell helped out for two reasons. First and most importantly he liked JoJo and his mother, he knew JoJos mom had just been killed and went to his house specifically to protect him even before he knew about Elsa. Second, I think he was gay, so he was sympathetic with the Jews. Additionally, he knew they were about to lose and everything the gestapo were doing was pointless.",dpqt2y
fh1o1oz,"I think at the beginning of the movie it is heavily implied that Sam Rockwell is conflicted about Nazism, the horrors of war or even himself. This can be guessed from his alcoholism and the back handed comments that he threw towards the Nazi Youth. So yes, I believed that it stayed in character that he would help Jojo's friend",dpqt2y
f8gve9q,"I disagree about sam Rockwell’s character - his motivation for protecting jojo and the girl made sense with that context as he was also someone the nazis wanted to rid the world of. But he wasn’t a hero, he was just a survivor. He has a very human reaction to this completely awful reality. Survive.",dpqt2y
f8h6fpt,I felt like his character was there to show just how many people that were involved in high ranking positions in 1940's Germany were sympathizers to the victims of the Holocaust (ScarJo) or were the very thing that the Nazi's were condemning (homosexuality). It also explains why he protected JoJo.,dpqt2y
f98pl0l,"This is more or less where I’m at too. A lot of humor is just “very silly exaggerated thing happens”, and a lot of that stuff was too over-the-top for me. I DID really like ScarJo though, she’s basically carrying the movie. Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo leader was also hilarious, and that kid Yorki just got funnier and funnier as the movie went on.

Sam Rockwell just...wasn’t funny. Not to me at least. It’s the same joke every time that he’s disillusioned and not taking this seriously, and it wasn’t really delivered right the first several times so it doesn’t come back on later either. To make matters worse, his goofy outfit ruins the otherwise very impactful battle scene near the end. Rebel Wilson was in a similar boat, her “dumb propaganda swallower” bit fell flat the first few times and then didn’t improve.

Taika’s Hitler might have been the weakest part of the movie to me. He’s merely silly without being clever or funny, and all of his scenes are really about TELLING us what Jojo is thinking or feeling when the movie should be SHOWING us. I think you’d have something much stronger if you took all of that imaginary Hitler stuff out, especially since only a few early scenes make it anything that other characters notice (Yorki noticing how Jojo talks to himself). It’s not even really a plot point, it feels like something they put in so they build misleading trailers around it. You’d shorten the movie significantly too, which I think would be to its benefit.

The drama worked MUCH better, when it wasn’t undermined by the comedy. Even then though, it feels like the movie’s tone is just whiplashing all over the place all the time.",dpqt2y

fg3av5s,"At first I thought it was a shallow movie, using fake german accents with very american expressions, and dumb ""haha, nazis"" jokes. As it progressed, though, particularly when it was made clear that Hitler was a figment of Jojo's imagination, I found it to be a fascinating depiction of the Nazi regime as seen from Jojo's eyes.

Just like the Hitler character wasn't real and yet Jojo saw him and interacted with him, we don't know how many of the characters and their silly behavior, how many of the colors and the pretty or ridiculous uniforms, etc, were created or exaggerated by his 10-year-old mind that was delusional enough to depict a beautiful and glorious Germany only days before they lost the war. 

What was powerful was every time (which was pretty often) the cruel reality of the situation managed to break through his mind and even in his silly little world, the regime showed how devastating or terrifying it could be.

I'm not sure it said anything new about blind nationalism, but I thought it was a beautiful and original way to depict it. Granted, I haven't seen another movie that does a similar thing, but point me in the direction of one if there is, because I want to watch it then :D",dpqt2y
fg5dued,I did think that that dancing ending was a little weird. I kind of expected a different kind of dance like the one Jojo did with his mother; that would have been a better way to end it than the awkward swaying and snapping.,dpqt2y

f6eb8bk,"The whole point of the movie is that we are more alike than different.  We want the same things - acceptance, happiness, and love especially. So what would it matter if she was played by a Jewish woman or not.",dpqt2y
f6hhud9,She is not. The director and actor of Hitler however is. So I don't think it matters that the Jewish character wasn't played by a Jew. There was plenty of representation. (Scar Jo is also Jewish),dpqt2y
f6e8rjt,Shes not Jewish but she did a great job who cares it's not like its blackface,dpqt2y
f6nbipq,"The main complaint against satire of Nazism is that it ""makes light"" of a serious subject matter. I don't personally think this movie ""makes light"" of Nazism--I think the dramatic aspect of the story ensures that the consequences of Nazi ideology are pretty soundly felt, at least on an individual level.  Other people just think Nazism is something too serious to ever overlap with comedy, satirical or otherwise, which is their prerogative.  I will say I think the satire component of the story appropriately punches up (I would argue that satire that punches down is not actually satire), and demonstrates the silliness of Nazi ideology, propaganda, and self-aggrandizement while (in my opinion) still clearly showing how powerful and dangerous it was/is, despite it being so (literally) ridiculous and fragile.

Talk to your friend about the movie and see if she's interested.  Show her a trailer if she wants a feel for it.  I'd do that for any movie before seeing it with a friend--it's not going to be fun if one of us isn't enjoying it.",dpqt2y
f6qr4zr,"I am Jewish and this movie shot immediately to the top of my favorite movie list. Period. Like, top 10 all time. I'm definitely going to agree with showing your friend the trailer first, but unless she's the type to get offended over any perceived slight she wont find it offensive. You're more at risk of it just not being her type of movie, than her finding it offensive.",dpqt2y
f6mvc88,"Of course it depends on a person, different Jews will have different opinions on this movie, but in general it's not offensive. Actually all the shit said about Jews in the movie was pretty much what Nazi propaganda said about Jews, so it comes as no surprise if you're familiar with the history of Holocaust or visited Yad VaShem, Jewish Museum in Berlin, or other museum of the kind.

Bear in mind that this movie will be released in Israel. If the distributors don't hesitate to show it to the audiences which are up to 100% Jewish, it tells you something, doesn't it?",dpqt2y
f6pwyki,"Everyone is different, of course, but I saw it with Jewish friends and they loved it. There is some harsh language about killing Jews - especially early on, before the movie introduces people who resist Nazi ideology - that could be difficult to hear. I found them hard to hear and I’m not Jewish. But the movie overall is super clear about whose side it’s on (anti-Nazi).

I mean, I’d show her the trailer first, certainly.",dpqt2y
f6qhou4,I think it does a great job of making fun of Hitler and Nazis without making fun of their evils or being disrespectful. It finds a delicate balance between satire and drama,dpqt2y

And maybe hopefully Jojo realized that in someway so the lasting image of his mom can be not the body hanging, but that of the upbeat person and of the butterfly.",dpqt2y

He even said that they were screwed and he was gonna go out in style. Jojo got injured on his watch, he seems to honestly admire Rosie as a good person (maybe they were childhood friends?), and suddenly Jojo had no one else. That’s why he told him to stay home, out of the war and take care of his family. You could argue about the other children his age wearing cardboard uniforms but the Gestapo will hang deserters and disobedient commanders as much as Jews.",dpqt2y

Jojo's mother claims she won't do anything to risk her sons life, yet engages in the resistance.

Elsa plays into the stereotypes the nazi's had about Jews to try and scare and intimidate Jojo, despite actually caring about him and his mother.

To be taken seriously is what fascists desire most of all, because they are not serious; logic and rationality are not things that they care for beyond their exploitation against their opponents. Engaging fascists on those terms serves only to legitimize them.

Sartre said it best:

>[Fascists] are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

And that juxtaposition between ridiculing them and showing the sheer horror and trauma on top of that is so clearly deliberately paced.

The narrative around the book about Jews for example. And the 11 year old kid marching off to war, talking about 'his worries' about how the whole world is coming for him.

Given how the Gestapo and Captain K arrive at the house within a few minutes I presume her death was very recent, and they immediately swarm the house. 

They never clearly state or imply that Captain K was part of the resistance. My take is that while Rosie was firmly for the resistance, Captain K was more a resentful, begrudging, apathetic adaptor. He didn't support the war, and moreso he had his own secret of being gay that would have made him a target. Nonetheless though, he went along with it.

It watered down and infantilized the subject (which I’m sure you appreciated) to make it more consumable for a mass audience, which I think is disrespectful to the actual victims. This trend of using the Holocaust as a narrative tool to drive larger plot points has been more and more common in films/shows like x men, shutter island, and the strain and I think Jojo follows in that trend.

The last few German movies (or involving Germans) I saw where about world wars, Nazi or Cold War and the wall. Famous recent German movies ? The Fall, The Lives of Others, Good Bye Lenin.

And the effect of doing lazy jokes, offensive or not, should just be your audience shrinking naturally. 

As for your last paragraph, I think you're being a little bit presumptive. I do have a lot of opinions on this subject, but I did my best to make what I said as unbiased as possible, but maybe I wasn't as successful as I hoped. I'm not the kind of person to blame any negative feedback on the world being too PC. I eye-roll every time I hear ""You can't say anything anymore."" However, it bothers me just as much when something that is clearly a joke, a good one at that, gets a lot of fire for being offensive. Like, when Nimesh Patel told a gay joke, one that is actually pro-LGBT, got kicked off stage and banned from a club because he was straight and telling a joke that even had the word ""gay"" in it.

I just think, and maybe it's because this video is a few years old and things have changed in that short amount of time, that the PC side of things is definitely a lot more aggressive than someone saying ""That's not funny to me."" Kevin Hart is the perfect example of someone making a joke and 8 years later the audience wants to take away his career for it. 

I think the way he describes PC not ruining comedy sounds ideal, you have every right to make comedy about whatever you want, while the audience has every right to decide if they like it, if it's in pour taste, ect. But, the audience, with social media, is huge and some people love being outraged. So, the literal audience in the room at a comedy show may find a joke about nazis funny, but when someone records it and puts it online and people who are offended by even the word nazi can have a loud enough voice to try to ""cancel"" that person, that's where the problem lies.

Yes, many people don't really realize that Germany literally used child soldiers near the end of the war. Some Americans reported capturing POWs that were 8 years old. Many times, they would be put in charge of machine guns or flak cannons. Alternatively, they'd be assigned as assistants to Luftwaffe units (the Luftwaffe was responsible for manning anti-air artillery, which was pretty much the only thing they could at that point anyway since the Germans were functionally out of aircraft near the end of the war).

Satire should be something that points out flaws in something in a funny way.  Most of the comedy hit me the wrong way, like the German Shepherd thing.  It was dad jokes, but not in the way they can be good.

I guess I've seen enough WWII movies and documentaries that I can't simply abide ""Nazis bad"" as an overarching theme, even if it's interspersed with a little bit of ""Nazis silly"" that kind of detracts from the first point.

And yeah, we go from dad jokes and eleven-year-olds talking about kid issues to seeing the protagonist's mother hung for treason.  That's a horribly ham-handed way to go, and it really made me angry with the film for emotional whiplash.

I mean, it wasn't all bad, I really would rather have had a movie where Stephen Merchant kept doing his thing the whole time, but funny and malevolent in that context is incompatible with whatever Rebel Wilson was doing.

YMMV.",dpqt2y
f7drwzk,">Why didn't you like the film?  I'd love to have a genuine debate about it.

So first off, I've definitely seen worse movies.  There was also a lot to like about it, mostly that the performances by Thomasin McKenzie, Stephen Merchant, and Scarlet Johansson were all top notch.

But the mood snaps gave me whiplash.  It was jarring to switch between pathos, both earned and 'cheap' (i.e. Nazis EVIL), and pure cartoonish silliness. I'm a huge fan of cartoonish silliness at times, but I don't see the same universe being able to accommodate both people who would execute Johansson for spreading propaganda and Rebel Wilson doing her take on the dumbest human on Earth.

I didn't see it as saying anything useful, which to me is necessary for worthwhile satire. I didn't see it as very funny, all the jokes were basically just dad jokes.  I guess I just don't get what people saw in it.",dpqt2y

He then slowly starts acting differently as the movie goes on and as Jojo starts showing more doubts about Nazi ideology. All of a sudden he's not all jokes and support anymore; he's angry and screaming and talking about destruction and death. It helps highlight how once the shiny veneer of the party is wiped away, it's not as welcoming or jovial as Jojo might have thought - - there's a darkness there that Jojo only notices after he starts questioning even little things here and there.",dpqt2y

There's a reason why western media never shuts the fuck up about Nazis, is because it's a perpetual propaganda tool for the US, British, Israeli governments.

You guys in the US complain about all those new Nazis but ignore that it's your media industry that oversaturates Nazis into the public  mind. 

Disney made propaganda films for the US government. One had Donald Duck as a Nazi. For decades, people watched it and made the false connection that Disney was pro Nazi. People are idiots like that.

The modern Disney company is nothing like Walt. They're just a bunch of businessmen who bought the company when it was struggling and capitalized on the original name brand's wholesome identity.

Modern Disney is a bunch of skeezy rat bastards who got so big because the US government gave them and their buddies the ability to monopolize the market and buy out anything not nailed down.

The US government dumped 70 year old anti monopoly laws in their favour because they work in silent collusion. Hollywood works as a propaganda mill, and as an information/ideological gatekeeper.

The Vietnam War lasted 10 years and there was massive protests.

Since 911, the US has been at war in 7 different countries and no one says shit.

American liberals are some of the most pussified, pacified, delusional ""activists"" on the planet. Your media and government figured out how to suppress and manipulate youth activism via entertainment.

Disney owns part of VICE. One of VICE's founders made the Proud Boys. You guys don't even have enough real racists that your media has to concoct them.

Disney also owns the History Channel now. How many more shows about Nazis and the Occult or Nazi hidden gold are they going to churn out?

Looks like the arrest/execution happened sometime that afternoon  when kid was chillin+cooking with Elsa at home (feet were quite blue by the time kid found them). The gestapo likely came in after Rosie was caught to search the home for any clues to the resistance+hideaways but were instead vouched for by Sam Rockwell as true nazis unlike their mom + the book. 

Man when he was chasing the butterfly, I was literally ""we haven't seen ScarJo in awhile, guess she's just a minor minor character"" then my heart sank",dpqt2y

That means they were probably friends. Also Rosie was wearing sun glasses at the time to probably hide her red eyes and tears.,dpqt2y

Something about Sam's character (who I cant remember for the life of me) made me think he knew rosie before. Their interaction at the pool and the one I mentioned earlier. Plus he seemed to have a soft spot for jojo. Maybe he knew his dad, idk.",dpqt2y
f72dwrm,"My best guess is that they both helped the resistence and she may have been pretty ""high ranking""/important in it. Their interaction at the start of the movie was no way a ""good aquaintances"" interaction.

That's because it's in poor taste to depict Nazism this way. That being said, Life Is Beautiful and Au Revoirs Les Enfants are somewhat similar.

Not about the Holocaust.

https://www.awardsdaily.com/2019/10/25/interview-tom-eagles-on-creating-the-tone-of-taika-waititis-jojo-rabbit/



- Edit -

When I was searching for the above link, I found a different article by the [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/making-jojo-rabbit-how-taika-waititi-scored-beatles-music-his-hitler-satire-1252528) 

“Once the 40-day production wrapped, Waititi placed a cold call to Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino, who'd scored projects ranging from Ratatouille to Jurassic World. Recalls Giacchino, ""He was like, 'Do you remember what you did for Up?' And I go, 'Yeah, I remember that.' And he goes, 'Just do that.' "" While Waititi and his editor, Tom Eagles, spliced together footage, Giacchino and a 35-piece orchestra recorded about 45 minutes of fairy-tale-style music at Abbey Road Studios in London. But Waititi also wanted the soundtrack filled with more contemporary music, like Beatles songs. During research for the script, while watching documentaries on the Hitler Youth, Waititi couldn't help but notice a creepy historical echo. ""It struck me, the similarities between the crowd at Hitler's rallies and the frenzy at Beatles concerts,"" he says. Wrangling the rights to German-language Beatles songs for a comedy about Nazism proved to be difficult, though. ""The first response is, 'Um, I don't think we want to do that,' "" says Giacchino. But, having previously worked with Paul McCartney, the composer made a direct plea. ""Once his people saw the film and understood, they made it happen,"" he says.

The first assemblage of Jojo ran two hours and 40 minutes, way too long for a comedy. ""We didn't want it to turn into Titanic,"" says Eagles. 


This doesn’t really talk explicitly about the footage, the first article I linked does, but I think I love how when they wanted to get the rights to the Beatles songs, Michael Giacchino, was like “...yeah.... we can’t do that...” and then they did it!!",dpqt2y
f79krdm,"Yeah, that's exactly my point. Even though we're hearing English, the characters are all supposed to be speaking German. Which makes this and the ""Shitler"" joke impossible. You have to just ignore this fact and not think about the language situation.",dpqt2y

For me these movies are a good thing because they show a new generation what our history is. In school this is often presented in a very boring way so these movies are sometimes a much more desirable way to approach this topic.

f6n1ft3,"It seemed pretty clear (at least to me) that that's what they were going for--both characters were pretty heavily coded as being gay and in a relationship.  There's also a moment where they almost kiss each other.  The movie did just about everything it could to tell us what was going on there without showing an onscreen kiss or explaining it in the dialogue.

As for character arc interpretation, I think Captain K was another character who, like Jojo's mom, was ""doing what he could"" (a.k.a. the main theme of the movie).  It was strongly suggested that he sabotaged at least himself (if not an entire military operation) in ""an extremely preventable military accident"" to get himself and Finkel pulled from the front lines.  He very clearly and deliberately handwaves and ignores the huge red flags Jojo is throwing up everywhere by talking about all these hypotheticals of helping/hiding/talking to/turning in a Jew.  He appears to lack conviction in Nazi ideology, and he admires Rosie for having the courage to ""be an actual good person"" by taking direct action against the Nazis instead of focusing solely on her own survival like he has.  He does sympathize with Jojo and Rosey--he knows Rosey was just killed for being a good person during the Gestapo scene (the Gestapo are investigating the house *after* Rosey's death--Jojo and the audience just don't know it yet).  Captain K was likely going to the house to break the news to Jojo when the scene with Elsa/""Inga"" happens.  In that moment, Captain K does what he can.   Same in the moment where he comforts and saves Jojo at the end--he's doing what he can.",dpqt2y
f6mcbyo,"Here's my thought on Captain K's character arc, based on some input elsewhere that I read.

He and Finkel are certainly gay.  Captain K knows that as a gay man in Nazi Germany he has 2 choices:  suppress it and be a Nazi, or be executed.  He chooses the former.  

He then intentionally injures himself so that he and his attache (Finkel) are removed from the front lines and put somewhere safer.  As a target of hatred and being forced to be a Nazi, he does what he can to help out Jojo and Elsa without exposing himself.  Then when it's clear that the allies are going to take the town (and knowing that as a Nazi captain he will most likely be executed) he says ""Fuck it"" and lets his inner flamboyance out.",dpqt2y

f7o13io,"I think the satire in this movie isn’t so much “Nazis bad” but pointing out the hypocrisy and delusional nature of hating others. Like the “the Japanese don’t look very aryan to me” joke. Also, it is a very specific type of humor so I get that it’s not for everyone. It’s right up my alley though.",dpqt2y
f7eklb2,"This is juicy!  I like it.

The mood snaps are well done, imo.  For all intensive purposes, they are there to give you whiplash mostly.  That said, when the movie itself swings fully from drama to comedy, you have a buffer scene full of tension and comedy at the same time, which worked extremely well for me.  All the laughs in the theater were nervous and done through short breaths when the gestapo came in.  

This contrast was done for one reason; it's from a kid's perspective on how silly Nazi's were.  The movie is constantly beating you over the head with evidence that Nazi's are just naive, ungrown adults who haven't been able to mature.  Hence the most reprehensible one we actually see, Rebel Wilson.  So, thusly, it saturates itself in comedy when the environment is consequence free.  Take note how the type of comedy changes - when JoJo is with his mom, the comedy is exponentially more heartwarming.  She is purposefully fostering that environment.  

The mood changes in the world highlight the crux of what Nazism is.  It's this silly little ideology, a naive worldview that is easy to make fun of and easier to laugh at, especially regarding inconsistencies.  But it also has devastating consequences.  The point of the film is to show how such a childish view can cause so much suffering.  The last act is JoJo learning to grow and mature but also maintain that air of innocence and comedy among the great suffering caused by the Nazi's reign. 

I'm only beginning to scratch the surface of why I love this satire, but ultimately the movie satirizes just how fucking stupid Nazi's are while also highlighting the suffering that stupidity can cause.  Very few people get that message that hate is naive but dangerous, and overcoming it takes understanding and empathy, but that doesn't make it any less of an obvious theme.",dpqt2y

Even as it gets more desperate and absurd (Metal for Hitler!"") the Germans are still positive that they will win. Hell the last battle scene shows children, soldiers, shepards, and shopkeepers alike rushing into battle because they have all been led to believe that they, as Aryan Germans, could never lose to the Russians and Americans. Also, remember Yorki says ""They eat babies and fuck their dogs so if we lose they'll eat our babies and fuck all our dogs.""

Essentially from a historical context POV it's obvious that Germany was going to lose. But to those characters in the moment it wasn't so obvious. Even Elsa totally believes Jojo when he says ""Germany won. You can't come out."" Because for the past decade or so they'd been led to believe that Germany couldn't lose. That everyone who wasn't German would kill them for being German.

>Because hollywood is **filled with jewish movie critics** who refuse to laugh at anything dealing with nazi germany at this time.

was outlandishly ignorant and shitty, and there's a history of films, TV, and other works to prove that it's false. The way you lumped all Hollywood Jews together in their ""refusal to laugh"" is absurd, and one Jewish critic does not support that claim. For every one Jewish person that did not like the movie, I could show you two non-Jews that also didn't. 

I loved the movie, and I disagree with that particular critic. But part of what the film satirizes is narrow-minded and potentially hurtful generalizations like ""the RT score is lower than it should be because Jews can't take a joke."" I'm not saying it should be a capital crime to say that and *also* say that you liked the film, but there is an inherent conflict there, signaling that perhaps some of the film's thematic content has gone over your head.",dpqt2y

I also want to mention: the scenes where Jojo watches Hitler eat unicorn meat while he starves, where Jojo finds out real Hitler shot himself like the pants wetting coward he was, and the final confrontation scene all drive home the point, but without belaboring it, that bombastic ideologues are so entirely selfish, that when the chips are down, they will take an expeditious exit to stage left, and leave everyone else up a creek without a paddle.   


When it comes to deradicalization, making followers understand that their heroes don't care about them, beyond their use as cannon fodder, is a big step in getting them to reintegrate into normal society. The juxtaposition of Hitler as a complete tool, on top of the pain his policies and actions caused, was brilliant.",dpqt2y

this movie barely sends that message imo. it’s a series of gags depicting nazis negatively and jews positively, which isn’t a message anyone who hasn’t heard can possibly hear from this film. it toes the line of jewish supremacist propaganda in scenes, and never actually shows a flawed antagonist for you to root against or understand. a 10 year old boy meeting a young jewish girl and overcoming his unfounded, barely indoctrinated anti semitic beliefs isn’t much of a challenge. an older nazi, late teens or an adult, would’ve made for a better protagonist. but then you can’t make childish jokes about imaginary hitler in your holocaust movie.

To add my two cents there, I think if anything, the focusing on her shoes was more horrific than seeing her post-asphyxiation face or body in general. Rosie dances. Throughout the movie, she equates dancing and movement with love and freedom (especially with Jojo; look at her body language on the scenes where Jojo is not supposed to be present), and we see her feet and that pair of shoes framed as a symbol for these feelings on Rosie.

While I don't agree with a lot of your points, I can see where you're coming from, but this one I honestly can't see.  The only Jewish character we interact with is Elsa and she's flawed too (at least at the beginning).  She's basically letting her anger out by bullying a 10 year old boy.  While arguably the first scene where she threatens him with decapitation could be called necessary to stop him from reporting her (though I think she took it too far), the scene where she grabs him and suffocates him is pure bullying with no purpose other than to ""get back"" at someone she sees as representing those who hurt her.  Even her words aren't ""we're just people too"", it's her telling the representative of those that call her inferior that she's **superior** - the words of a hurt person lashing out.

So while it's definitely more subtle, I think the movie did a good job of avoiding portraying her as perfect and without flaws despite the obvious temptation to do so.",dpqt2y
f7mdbih,">a 10 year old boy meeting a young jewish girl and overcoming his unfounded, barely indoctrinated anti semitic beliefs isn’t much of a challenge. an older nazi, late teens or an adult, would’ve made for a better protagonist. but then you can’t make childish jokes about imaginary hitler in your holocaust movie.

I think you nailed it, that's a pretty good description of what seemed off about the movie to me.

In that way, it was like they set up a tee-ball for themselves (in the sense of showing ""this group is bad"", how much work does it take to show that about Nazis?), and somehow whiffed.

f7mvqti,"Well, you wouldn't have this: ""the point of the film is to show how such a childish view can cause so much suffering"" without there being a child to deliver it.  

Ultimately, my original comment counters the one you just made.  Any further argument is simply on whether or not the delivery of that message is done well or even done at all.  It was easy for me, my friends, and seemingly many fellow theater-goers to comprehend, which is why it baffled me that critics didn't.  Inexorably, however, that aspect of the film remains subjective, and I can see why misinterpretations of the message, or lack of interpretations, or views on whether or not the message was good will lead to negative opinions on the film.  I get it.  

The very fact that this message went under the radar of many critics who saw it, however, indeed justifies it's reason for existing.  It's a very easy to get and simple to understand message that is obvious to most, but yet those who write articles spread to the masses; those who lay down the tracks that guide society, don't get it.  We need this message now more than ever as more and more people move to stopping hate and radicalism through systems of control and stifling of discourse, because the only way to beat it is precisely through discourse and allowing empathy to flow freely from both sides.  This movies says that explicitly, going so far as to at first bash you over the head with it comedically, and then bash you over the head with it dramatically.  And yet, many didn't get it.  Doesn't make it any less of a necessary message that should be reinvigorated throughout the upper echelons of our media, however.  

Say what you want about the film but the very fact that the obvious main theme of the movie - whose very form and structure explicitly outline ""hate and radicalism, and it's perpetuation, are stupid and funny, but also really fucking dangerous too, here's many examples, and here's how you counter it"" - flew over the head of so many that desperately need to understand it most certainly justifies it's existence.

Addendum: you do not need an antagonist for an interesting story.  Jojo is the protagonist, and the antagonist is indoctrination, radicalism, and hate.  It's a highschool lit 101 principle that antagonism takes three forms generally: man vs man (typical hollywood fare) man vs environment (typical fare for movies that involve themes of hate, like AHX) and man vs self (jojo rabbit and AHX, bruh).",dpqt2y

That moment immediately destroyed everything that I thought I believed and set me on a completely different path.

Not sure how you managed to wedge in your beef with the ""liberal/conservative"" trope into this but I'll make my best effort to speak on this. The recent ""resurgence in Nazis""/Alt-right"" is by definition childish.  Strip away the awfulness of it all, and it really is just a reactionary, mediocre and low brow mentality.  The movie reflects that perfectly.

If there is a political message in the movie, I actually feel like the movie's target is liberals, and its intention is to shake the equally reactionary and mediocre liberals out of their reflexive reactionary stupor.   It replaces the traditional ""evil racist"" trope with a more realistic and sympathetic perspective, one that sees Nazis as childish buffoons trapped and blinded by their surroundings.  If you think this movie is targeting racists, I can understand how you would consider it a failure.  

BTW, saying ""I don't consider myself racist"" is kind of like saying ""I don't mean to be racist...but"".  Also putting ""resurgence in Nazis"" in quotation marks tells me you think that this claim is full of shit.  I suppose the word resurgence might not be the best word to describe the modern state of Nazism.

Then It seems like he has a fairly close relationship with Jojo's mother, who was involved with the anti war movement. There is also the fact that he helped out Elsa when they were being interrogated even though he probably knew that Jojo's sister passed away, 

so i guess the film implies that he was secretly sympathetic to the anti war movement, and since he was somehow well acquainted with Jojo's mother, gay (had motive to be against the mother), and openly endorses running drills and practices that he knows is pretty much pointless (like teaching the kids to swim in a pool with their stuff on), it wouldn't be far that he was almost taking like really passive aggressive jabs at the third reich",dpqt2y

The other actions he takes throughout the movie show that he has enough of a sympathetic side that he isn't the traditionally evil nazi. But due to the scope of the story, there probably wasn't opportunities to highlight it in a good way.

So having him be gay, and that being something people may or may not cotton onto until the later stages of the movie, ends up showing that sometimes what people put out into the world isn't their true nature.

throwing high school lit terms around doesn’t make jojo a cinematic masterpiece. his internal conflict is effortlessly resolved, and even then dragged out, comparing it to ahx is deplorable. 

the idea of an “anti hate” film is just obnoxious, because telling people not to hate doesn’t do anything. it’s a piece of bland, bright entertainment that makes you feel morally righteous for not being hateful while giving you something to laugh at. racists come out of it feeling fine, probably having missed the entire point. not because it’s too subtle, but because it’s poorly made.",dpqt2y

does that need to be said though? would the alt right get anything out of this movie? they might out of american history x. this comes off as a way for people to feel superior to other people today via caricatures in ww2. 

that’s a really good take. the people in my theater laughed at all but one of the jokes in the film, the one about communism, and it started to feel like they were the real target of satire, like the director wanted to make it as “lolrandom” and cliched as possible to see what he could get away with and pass off as an effort, but there’s actually effort put in it, the sets and costumes are well done and there are some amazing shots, but the script falls flat and i don’t think it would succeed in showing a reactionary their flaws. when it takes a serious moment, it’s for the drama of the narrative (mom dying, germany taken), not the actual character building moments, which are mostly hammed up. 

i phrased that poorly but i’m not saying anything remotely racist, i also said a lot of people who are racist probably don’t really think they are, while many are openly racist because they don’t *really* have to deal with minorities, so they aren’t really faced with consequences. the “i’m not racist but...” has to be followed with something racist to imply racism. i’m just saying i don’t see how this film could be useful to anyone dumb and childish, or just locked into an idea enough to actually hold these views, when it basically panders to their level of humor and simplifies the issue, on a surface level, to “nazis dumb”. obviously the nazis weren’t all dumb, the persecution of a people
is systematic and done by conditioning. it’s possible for smart people to still be conditioned and victimized by toxic system of society. 

i agree more with the latter, that racism never really goes away, and has, especially in american history, popped back up consistently. now with the internet, it’s even more anonymous and casual since as you say they can talk freely. 

the assumption that all racists are stupid and immature rather than simply ignorant and brainwashed, like hundreds of thousands of others who get caught up in a pattern of thought that they cannot break.

It is a satire of fascism that has nothing interesting to say and does not even attempt to engage with fascism itself, and as such it fails at it’s stated intention.

The film can try to deceive people into thinking it’s good by being shot like a half assed wes anderson facsimile and having trite and forced emotional moments, but I am not fooled.

1. Lame and unfunny jokes. I laughed a couple times, but not enough for the movie to be what I would call ""funny"". Go watch 4 Lions if you want to see a dark comedy that's actually funny and has a point to it.

2. Weak story. The death of his mom is an attempt to add weight to the movie, but it doesn't work, nevermind the ridiculous way he finds out (he just happens to follow a butterfly until he finds himself *standing next to his hanged mother*, for fucks sake, that's so contrived), the previous events in the movie - standing next to a hand grenade as it goes off and surviving, the buffoonish gestapo, the imaginary hitler that jojo talks with - establish a world disconnected from reality, so the shock one gets from learning about her death felt manipulative to me because the movie had been lightheared until then, with real danger only occasionally being hinted at, so that climax felt like a cheap way of adding a catalystic event for jojo to change his view on the world. It felt forced instead of a natural progression. Also, I honestly found the movie quite often boring, it's obvious what the story will be about (jojo realizing nazism arent great), and the delivery was too predictable for me (I'm talking about how scenes play out here, rather than overarching story as a whole).

3. This movie trivializes nazis by making them appear like morons. It is very convenient for the anglophone world, then they can pretend that Nazis weren't major movements in their countries as well, and only the Germans were stupid enough to fall for it. But that is *not* what actually happened, they had major supporters in every country around the world. Therefore it irks me when a movie downplays them.

I used those terms because they're not high school lit terms, they're terms taught in high school lit.  They are literally one of the most simple components of modern storytelling, and I was using the fact that they're taught in HS to convey the point that *this should be easy to understand, but you want to justify your hatred for the movie, so you purposefully misconstrue it.*

Everything else you've said can be addressed by my above comments with little more effort on my part.  It seems you are holding onto a preconceived notion that the movie is terrible and any arguments otherwise are simply wrong.  Before you go accusing me of only wanting to see the movie as perfect, I have the following criticisms: nazi girl was too fucking stupid, the bullying scene was contrived, they could have added ten minutes showing Jojo grieving at the end, and the transitions to tragedy could have been a little more padded, aside from the gestapo scene. On a storytelling and technical level, it's no more than a 7/10 for me.  Doesn't mean it didn't make me cry like a lil bitch, and it doesn't mean it's themes weren't delivered extremely well to me. I also genuinely consider other people's points when arguing the validity of this film's messages, but for you, it seems you are making roundabout cyclical justifications for your viewpoint without addressing what I'm actually saying.  

""I mostly take issue with the comedy."" I already addressed that and how it's subjective.  

Counter to what?  Nazism?  There shouldn't be one.  It's a film about how fanaticism is a blind worldview.  The counter comes from Jojo learning how to mature past this blind worldview.  

His internal conflict is constantly shifting.  That early conflict is resolved easily through love and empathy, one of the core messages of the film.  We see his internal struggles crescendo when his mother dies and his own views become incompatible with his outside environment.  He stabs Elsa, initially blaming her.  We see his conflict shift early on from hate vs love to ""okay, I love this person.  How do I protect them from the world around me?""  And then we see ""How could I have thought these things about this person I love"" with the book scene, and then ""the world around us is safe.  How do I keep this person close to me?""  

Jojo rabbit is a coming of age film about overcoming hate with personal connection.  And JUST as I have repeated multiple times, not many critics got that message.  It's rudimentary, yes, and should be common sense, yes.  But it isn't common sense anymore, and that alone justifies its existence.  The movie was made because Taika wanted to remind people that hate is this small little thing that can be overcome through human decency.  Even if it completely goes over everyone's heads and is only appreciated in that light ten years from now as a cult classic, I still consider it a success that he delivered that message to at least a significant portion of the non-critical audience.

We're done here.  I'm not going to waste my time arguing subjectivity and the nature of conflict within stories.  That shit is basic storytelling 101.  I refuse to participate in an argument where one part is trying to understand the other while also showing them a different side while that other party is finding new and improved ways to argue the same three things that have already been thoroughly addressed and dissected.

fl4bzrk,"That's not quite what I meant. But while I disagree with your points, I respect your take and appreciate that you thought more about it and shared.

Personally, I found the movie pretty funny.

I agree that the world was set up with a somewhat cartoonish bent to it - the examples you listed are good - but as other commenters have said, I took that to reflect Jojo's childhood lens of the war and life in general. Imaginary Hitler appears less often as the movie goes on, replaced by Sam Rockwell's character as a sort of father figure, I believe. By the point of his mother's death, we had already experienced some serious and sobering scenes (especially the stressful Gestapo one), and saw that his mother seems to be a part of the Resistance. I think it was well foreshadowed. The butterfly felt contrived to you, which I get, but I really liked the symbolism. Mom had told Jojo that love feels like having butterflies in your stomach and he was struggling with harboring those feelings for a Jewish girl, but following that sensation - following the butterfly - led to pain as well. Again, that's how people described love again and again in the movie. I found it poignant and beautiful, if perhaps literary at the sake of realism.

I also see the point about trivializing. To me, I appreciated humanizing some Germans who, to different extents and for different reasons, were caught up in the movement. The Fat Kid had nothing better to do. Jojo needed a father figure. Sam Rockwell was gay and would have been socially ostracized - if not sent to a concentration camp - had he not joined. As the Fat Kid said at the end, many Germans didn't know that concentration camps were death camps, grew up with severe nationalistic indoctrination after WWI, and so on. I felt like the movie did a good job showing the Nazis as frighteningly coercive (see: Hitler's angry speeches to Jojo near the end) but also as made up of people, sometimes, not just blanket evil villains. As the movie deals with a Nazi (kid) changing his perspective, that's an important tack for the film to take.

Now, I'm Jewish. My grandparents survived the Holocaust but many of their siblings and older relatives did not. They survived and fled the Soviet Union as well. I wasn't offended by the depiction of Nazis here because I didn't detect any sympathy for the group - just an acknowledgment that people are people and that, therefore, people can change. If conditions are right. Yes, it wasn't an exercise in realism, and yes, it wasn't Ulysses or To the Lighthouse or Mulholland Drive or 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie wears its messages on its sleeves. But I think they are no less important for that.

Anyways, thanks for sharing. I appreciate it.",dpqt2y

Welcome to subjective taste. Doesn't mean the movie is trash, just that its not for you and your pseudo intellectual friends.

3- I disagree with this and I feel like you're just, again, trying to be too intellectual for your own good. They actually showed that not all Nazis were bad people, for example captain K, who gave his life to save Jojo's and they also showed that some of the boys that fought for the 3rd reich were simply brainwashed/blinded by their fanatism and weren't really able to develop their own opinions/view from the world just yet. 

Welcome to the world of satire/parody, of course the Nazis aren't gonna look like they would in an actual war movie.

It would had been better served being cut down to a 15-20 minute short as the ONLY thing it has going for it is conveying a strong sense of isolation, but it ruins it by leaving dangling plot threads lying all over the place instead of tying ANYTHING together, as if the director had a basic outline of the beginning of a story, and had no ending in mind whatsoever, and never remotely bothered trying to put one together.

watching this film for the message is like reading playboy for the articles. a self indulgent mess. even he thinks this idea is blatantly obvious, but i don’t think he has an especially deep understanding. vapid “love conquers all” themes that absolutely did not hold true for many more people during the war. 

also, this isn’t to help my case, but i watched these two videos this morning and the difference in analysis between this director, robert eggers, and todd phillips is actually jarring. wakiti‘s film is so openly shallow with such a basic and underdeveloped message, he can’t even analyze a scene from it, instead spending the video drawing on the players. stephen merchant does a better job analyzing the scene and its historical context, and actually considered his character for the one scene he was in. love that man.

2. Yes of course taste is subjective, and yet most of the people who watch films as a job agree with me. So I think I'm on to something when I feel it wasn't that good. I'm not 'crying' about the death being in the movie, I'm saying it's unearned and manipulative. You clearly feel otherwise, we'll have to agree to disagree.

3. Yeah we're working with different definitions of nazi here. To you it seems to mean basically every German (I'm not surprised you would understand it that way). To me it means the people who actively supported and believed in nazism. Captain K was never a nazi, though that only became clear later (but there were hints early on). Children aren't responsible for their actions, and are therefore also absolved. The only nazis in the movie to me were the fat woman and the gestapo group, and Hitler, obviously. 
Regardless 

> They actually showed that not all Nazis were bad people, for example captain K, who gave his life to save Jojo's and they also showed that some of the boys that fought for the 3rd reich were simply brainwashed/blinded by their fanatism and weren't really able to develop their own opinions/view from the world just yet. 

So you're really telling me before the movie you thought all people in the army were nazis? Because that's just completely moronic. Good for you that watching the movie made you realise better (a far better movie about that is The Bridge, from 1959 btw), but to the rest of us that's about as interesting as saying 1+1=2. No wonder you felt it had a message lol, but to the ones of us that weren't born yesterday there was nothing original there.",dpqt2y
f67ccw2,"The Lighthouse clearly *does* have a plot. There are, in fact, several plots running in parallel throughout the film. The most obvious is the cabin fever tale, wherein two Lighthouse workers gradually go mad and turn on each other. 

Simultaneously, the film is a story about two men unsuccessfully trying to repress their own identities. Prior to the events of the film, Thomas Howard allows a fellow woodcutter to be crushed to death. Unable to reconcile with that fact, he appropriates a new identity (Ephraim Winslow), and begins working in a new environment (the Lighthouse) so that he may distance himself from his actually identity, that of a man who is responsible for another's death. These efforts are stymied when Thomas Howard learns that the man he's working with, (who, relevantly, is *also named Thomas*) is also secretly responsible for the death of a former coworker. In being stranded in the Lighthouse with a man of the same name, guilty of the same wrongdoing, Thomas Howard is forced to confront his own identity, and attempt to reconcile with himself. Unable to do so, he murders Wake, who acts as a surrogate for Tom Howard. 

The story *also* functions as an allegory for an encounter between Proteus and Prometheus. I don't feel like explaining this one, but if you're familiar with the two figures, you'll see the parallels.

There's a ton of other stuff going on in the film that I don't feel like getting into unless necessary.
But please, tell me which scenes are ""repeated for no other reason but tobpad the runtime"". I can think of no scenes which contributed nothing to the film. 

You also claim it ""left dangling plot threads all over the place"". I don't think this in itself is an effective criticism. Often times, leaving things open is *more effective* than resolving them neatly. I can think of one instance in which this was the case for The Lighthouse; that being the final scene, in which Thomas Howard enters the room the light is in. This scene aside, which I will defend if necessary, I can't think of any plotlines which were ""left dangling"" as you claim. Would you care to enlighten me?",dpqt2y

One of the biggest things that bothered me with this film is that it was made obvious in the very first scene that thomas had been to the lighthouse before, as he knew exactly were the mermaid idol was hidden, yet it never went anywhere else with it, and directly contradicts the scene throughout the rest of the movie. Two guys in a room going stir crazy once again is not a plot. The film sets itself up to do something actually clever by having both of them have the same name, aka they SHOULD had ended up with them actually BEING the same person long since gone mad, but it shrugs that off in favor of nothing, just as it does with all of it's other plot points which exist for no other reason than to give hope that you are watching an actual film, and not just random scenes of ultimately nonsensical dialog..",dpqt2y

f68g8lb,"> it was made obvious in the very first scene that thomas had been to the lighthouse before,

This is FAR from obvious. There are two alternative interpretations, each of which is more compelling:
1. He sat on the bed, felt a lump, looked where he was sitting, noticed a hole, checked to see if there was something in it, and found the mermaid, or 
2. The mermaid idol is enchanted and drew him towards it

> Two guys in a room going stir crazy once again is not a plot.

If you are using the term ""plot"" in the conventional sense of the word, this *is* a plot. If you're using the term in some stipulative sense, you need to make that clear. 

>  character having a backstory is not a plot.

My assertion is not that Thomas Howard having a backstory is equivalent to there being a plot. My assertion is that the process through which he is forced to reconcile with his identity, something which occurs gradually throughout the film subtextually, is a plot. 

>The film sets itself up to do something actually clever by having both of them have the same name, aka they SHOULD had ended up with them actually BEING the same person long sense gone mad, but it shrugs that off in favor of nothing,

Would making them the same person have been clever? At this point, it seems that sort of plot twist is a bit contrived. That said, the interpretation that they're the same person actually *is* reasonably well founded. See, for instance, the scene after Howard buries Wake. Wake is seen absolutely covered in dirt. Not a minute later, when Wake runs into the Lighthouse carrying an axe, he's completely clean, implying that the burial didnt depict an actual event. 

This aside, the criticism as you've presented it is still very weak. You say that it would have been more effective if they were the same person, (which I dispute) without explaining why. You're criticism basically amounts to ""this part is dumb, because I don't like it"".",dpqt2y

It clearly shows where he sits on the bed, and where the idol is. He sits, and then leans over and specifically, and very knowingly goes straight for it, knowingly removes stuffing that was placed there to hide it rather than digging around at all. IF they intended for this to not show he had foreknowledge of it's location then they did an absolute shit job of conveying that. And he doesn't ""reconcile his identity"". He yells at and gets drunk with an old man, and ends up effectively killing himself on accident. This movie basically boils down to ""Dude got a crappy job and then fell down the stairs and died.
