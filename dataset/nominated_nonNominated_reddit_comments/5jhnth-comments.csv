dbh4pzo,"A solid 7/10-8/10 flick depending on your interest in music and singing. Plot was predictable but hey I wasn't expecting anything hugely different. Definitely worth the time to watch, I had fun",5jhnth
dbghagk,"Here are my thoughts on this movie. Please feel free to add your own thoughts. I like discussion. Additionally, this will be mostly spoiler free. 

I thought the trailers gave out most of the punchlines, which weren't very funny after the first time - if at all. They also, unfortunately, gave out a lot of the scenes where we would feel compelled to care but don't end up caring at all (or even as much as we should) because we saw it in the trailers anyway. The last half hour or so was better than the beginning, in my opinion, with a nice range of music in different genres that I enjoyed listening to. Because of the widespread amount of stakes with the varying characters, I felt like nothing was really at stake, especially since a lot of the problems ""resolved"" themselves. I saw resolved in quotes because I don't feel they really did resolve the characters' issues. I did end up enjoying it more than I thought. 

MINOR SPOILERS: Lastly, damn! Buster's happy cheery face as he stole water and power from the city cracked me up. Especially in the beginning where he nearly injured countless people with his bike riding! ",5jhnth
dbhp8xs,"The J-pop red pandas were great. I'd give the movie a 6/10. Fun, great music, no real depth, but a good popcorn flick.",5jhnth
dbhwe6y,"Gotta say, this movie pulled some heavy mood whiplash out when I least expected it. I was starting to get bored up to that point. It was brutal and completely unexpected for this movie. From the trailer alone, I was expecting just basically a 90-minute concert in Zootopia's Theatre District from some actors and a bit of life drama I already knew the end to. Oh, she IS good. Oh, the dad loves him. Thanks trailer. Instead, I left with feels. Imagine if they ended it right there. Would've rivaled Toy Story 3.

I liked Ash's original song and Harambe's final songs the best. So glad he didn't stay with ~~Won't Back D~~Stay With Me my god I hate that song. All Of Me would've been *ok* too but the one they went with was the best, I think it was Elton John.

Can anyone with a better ear for it tell me if Melodyne was used here for the singers? The voices seemed so natural and I didn't hear many artifacts (I heard some on Tori's) but I'm not too familiar with how natural-sounding melodyne can make them. But some of it seemed too good to be true.

Also I think it's safe to say that after this movie, Rosita the pig went on to become the new Iron Man with that contraption she built overnight.",5jhnth

dbhfuyq,"I enjoyed it. I didn't get more or less than what the trailer promised me, and I'm ok with that. Yes, the plot was predictable and a lot of the big moments were spoiled, but it was a fun movie either way. I laughed quite a bit and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get wrapped up in the songs. It was light-hearted, not ground-breaking, but still enjoyable. ",5jhnth
dbut53v,"I went in with low expectations and enjoyed this. I'm honestly surprised at some of the reactions here. It was certainly better than The Secret Life of Pets, it has characters I actually cared about and moments I could enjoy. I don't usually like musical numbers in movies but these were great. 

Definitely laughed out loud at the car wash scene.
",5jhnth
dbg9c30,"I watched this movie few weeks ago and I thought it was one of the better movies from Ilumination.

I like that most of the cast has singing experience in some ways. The first and second part in this movie is kinda generic in the executions but the last 30 minutes were very good.

I think it is a good alternative if you want to take your family and looking for a good animated movie besides Moana.

Overall, if you like animated movie, talking animals, and pop music, then this movie is for you.

df6m9zg,"Hated Mike as a character and was waiting the whole movie for someone To finally knock him out or give him what he deserves. Didn't really like how they portrayed the dad pig as some incompetent parent and made it seem like he just straight up ignores his family yet he's providing for 25 damn children and how the wife just seems disappointed he fell asleep after working all day never really considering the dude is working his ass off... the kids go to school all day long or so it seems so .... they make the bears seem like the nad guys but you would be pissed to if someone stole your money and didn't pay you back ... then for Mike to claim the koalas money was his and then when they open it he has the audacity to say "" you lied to us "" he needed his teeth knocked out ..

deuutep,"This movie was better than it had any right to be. The brief synopsis would be 'Animated animal version of Idol' but there wasn't as much as I was expecting/hoping for, especially since from my understanding it was singing from the actual voice actors.

Also, some of the things that happened were so absurdly crazy that it was borderline kind of awesome. The car wash scene was nuts, the contraption that the pig mother created was so absurd, the fact that the Bear gangsters way of killing was to actually eat the mouse, McConaughey sing-talking to Call Me Maybe, etc.",5jhnth
dbj7odh,"I enjoyed it. As a guilty pleasure mostly. I mean yeah it was predictable story schlock. But I always wanted to hear Seth do My Way. The father son scene at the end actually got me tearing up. Maybe cause it seemed genuine instead of phoned in. The animators did a great job too better than Life of Pets but not as Good as Zootopia, but I enjoyed it more than Zootopia. Like I said guilty pleasure I liked it cause it's the kind of cheesey movie I needed and haven't seen in a long time. It goes for safe choices and yes there is a fart joke, but thankfully only one",5jhnth

dborlrn,"I don't want to spoil anything but I'll just say how I felt. This movie seemed to be dull like Secret Life Of Pets but I was surprised as the movie went on. There was a lot more songs than I assumed they were going to use which added to the mood/tone. The animation was very colorful and bright and for the most part, the characters had some sort of back story/development. Everything towards the end did start to speed up and wrap up nicely which was great. Overall it was a positive movie that if you enjoy animation/songs should have you leaving the theater happy. ",5jhnth
dbpe04w,"Disclaimer: I'm a sucker for animated films. On the flip side, I usually don't like things to heavy on music. With that said...

I really liked this film. It's definitely in my top 3 for animated films this year. Some characters were more cliche that others, but that comes with the territory of kid-focused movies. The characters felt real with their concerns and desires. I was rooting for all of them, and there was definitely a big payoff in the final concert. 

As I always recommended, see all animated films in 3D. ",5jhnth

dbgotx2,Why is this a film?,5jhnth
dbhu7jw,"Most kids' movies use music in order to avoid having plot. Albeit predictable, this movie had some thick plot. I'll complain a bit about all the autotune, every character except Mike (Seth McFarlane) had noticeable autotune whenever they sang. Just a little peeve for me really. Matthew McCaunaghey should be ashamed of himself. His performance here was *GREAT* whereas he just phoned it in for Kubo. Based on that, I expected a horrible voice performance from him and it ended up amazing me. Above all that, the fantastic climax really put this movie at 9/10",5jhnth

My one gripe, though, has to be Ash's boyfriend. In the cafe, he's playing his left-handed guitar left-handed. When he gets home, however, he's playing his guitar right-handed. And the tuning keys are configured for a right-handed guitar! Are we supposed to believe that this guy (or porcupine) is ambidextrous? And he has two guitars that look exactly the same, except that one is left-handed and the other is right-handed!?",5jhnth

dbgh82s,"A solid **6/10** from me. It's not going to get anything higher, but it's not going down either. The entire plot of the movie can be glanced in the trailers (which seem to be the trend nowadays), and it doesn't take any sort of initiative to venture away from its predictability. 

However, being predictable in this case means there's no immediately discernable upset in its plot that takes our attention away from its various musical scores that, to be perfectly honest, was the only reason why I was there. 

The elements of drama is there for people who like that sort of thing (like myself). While there is no visible effort made to stand out, each of the subplots are introduced, escalate, and wrap up as nicely as you would expect from its visuals. 

All in all, it's a lovely gift for everyone who loves a happy story where everyone's number one value is in forgiveness and understanding. ",5jhnth
dbo2e2i,Best part of the movie is the songs,5jhnth
dbt2fen,"To be honest, for me I didn't have any interest in seeing this, but I had the choice to either see this or Assasin's Creed, so I chose Sing.

I went into this with low expectations and as a way to pass time, and towards the climax of the film (when Meena started her song,) I was mentally wondering when the movie would end.

Most, if not all the characters were cookie cutter and bland, which I can't really blame because it's multiple characters with their own goals and arcs, but I can't say it did the film any favors either. I think I was more interested in Rosita and Gunter. Heavily disliked Mike (we first see him harassing and mugging an athsmatic monkey...) and Mr. Moon (he didn't work to get that theatre, his father did, and I can't say that he's a good owner of the theatre either, with the theatre in the dumps and him not paying his hardworking stage hands. He even gets someone else to pay for his previous troubles. I don't know why we keep seeing unlikeable characters being portrayed as likes me with sad back stories. I don't think it does them justice). Meena was meh, Ash was meeeeh, Johnny was cute and it was nice to see a gentle gorilla (although the filmmakers should have probably not gone with the ""apes committing crime,"" route, because now they're facing a bit of backlash, but I'm black and didn't really care too much after observing the issue).

Story was heavy but mixed up, both running into and leaning on cliches. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but again, nothing too impressive. Just meh? 

If you're looking for something new in the songs, then don't really expect much. I think I only heard two or three songs that were new, and it was Johhny, Ash, and Meena's songs. Everything else was something I heard of before or was just popular not too long ago, or was Frank Sinatra and stood out too much.

Like Secret Life of Pers, the character and setting designs compared to other animated features was a bit lackluster and unimaginative. I felt like it gave the movie a dull and generic atmosphere.


All in all I give it a simple 5/10. Don't regret seeing it, just the fact that I saw it in theaters. I might forget it after a while, and I don't think I'd want to watch it again.",5jhnth

dc58bqn,"just saw it, I really liked it. I was entertained through the whole thing. I really liked Johnny's (the gorilla) storyline with his dad, even though it was predictable how it would turn out. Him singing Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" was an awesome performance too.",5jhnth
dffqqg5,why do i want to bang that gorilla ,5jhnth
dcakr56,"What a terrible movie. I understand it's for kids but all the characters expect maybe the gorilla and the mom pig were awful. The rat is basically evil; self centered, cheater, shallow.  The koala is similarly terrible; consistently does illegal/immoral things, also self centered. I don't get why would anyone be rooting for these people?  All the funny bits were in the trailer. I don't think i laughed once during this movie. Again, i know it's kids movie but there were far better animated movies this year with better messages for kids.  ",5jhnth
detv2db,"Saw this today and found it absolutely lovely. A great heartwarming movie with a stellar cast , good music and cracking gags. Loved that the director is one of the main characters too :-). In fact the cast list is full of surprises! Wes Anderson?? Edgar wright??? Amazing.  Btw. WAY better than secret life of pets. On a par with zootopia. Zootopia is a crime thriller though so a completely different sort of movie. ",5jhnth
dbjabyi,"Really hated this movie. 

I just preface this with the fact that I haven't really liked most of Illumination's pictures but this is by far my least favorite of theirs. 

I found myself not laughing at almost anything in the entire movie (except the car wash scene). Every funny thing in the movie was shown in the trailer and having seen the trailer before just about every movie since January, I was really tired of those jokes going into it. I left the movie legitimately confused how I was so bored in such an over-the-top colorful movie!

The music choices ranged from the flowery poppy stuff that fit perfectly in the movie to slow songs like McFarlane singing Sinatra's 'My Way' that really didn't fit and had other stuff happening while it was sung presumably to keep kids interested.

One last point, that I felt was more like a nitpick at this point is just how unlikeable I found the Koala. I think most of it stems from him talking about how hard his dad worked to buy him the theater, then seeming embarrassed when he had to actually work at the car wash himself, but it all worked out for him because he found someone else to buy him the theater again. Just kinda got on my nerves...

Mike added great little small nuance to the movie. First - the mouse had great pipes. You see appreciation for it from various characters throughout the movie. Second - he clearly only cared about himself. Even the girl mouse was just a feather in his cap (likely why they didn't explore her). His jerkiness let the writers add in conflict, add a little color/controversy and then setup a great ending scene. 

My favorite part of Mike is while he is all about himself - he truly seems to love music. He lives the classics, but loves modern music with a good beat. You see both sides juxtaposed together when Meena gets on stage for her first time. When she knocks the stand over - Mike pulls out his jerk side, scoffs and walks off. When Meena starts to sing - Mike is flabbergasted! His appreciation for Meena's voice really pegs her as the best singer of the group.

dcem1fb,"I enjoyed it as a more mature film then as a kids movie. Each character had a flaw and a problem that they needed to overcome. While this is predictable and you already know how its going to end, i enjoyed the way each character handled their issues.

The gorilla was more worried about making his father proud then his own talent. He wanted the best of both worlds and tried to please his father and ended up getting him arrested. His father disowns him, and so he he wants to win his fathers love back. At the end, he goes to steal the chest to bail his father out, but sees the note that he is a gifted singer and decides that his own talent means more to him, and he devotes all 100% to his performance. 

The mouse was a narcissistic and selfish jackass. He was greedy and a con man. Hes pretty self explanatory honestly. He is motivated by money, by lust, and greed. He ends up deciding that since there is no prize money he wont perform because its a waste of time. Then after seeing everyone praise the mom pig, he decides the music is worth more then money. He even gets the girl.

The mom pig has low self esteem, a husband that doesnt really pay attention to her and 25 kids who need constant attention. She eventually learns to find confidence, ends up earning her kids respect and getting her husbands attention back. 

The porcupine is in an abusive relationship with a twat who keeps putting her down. She realizes that she is talented so much then her boyfriend is, and uses the pain to write a song that earns everyones respect, including her ex. Also through the auditions the koala tries to get her to dress like a girl, sing preppy pop music and change who she is. She also earns his respect and plays a crazy good song she wrote.

The elephant is self explanatory. Low self esteem, and ends up finding courage to sing and break through her shell. The mouse also looks down on everyone who auditioned, but salutes her and breaks out in tears at her singing.

The male pig who worked with the mom, he was just support to help her break through her shell and also comedic relief.

The koala was a narcissistic ego maniac who was hell bent on making money. He ends up lying and cheating his way to make his plan work and ends up crushing himself in the process.

Notice he was REALLY good, maybe even one of the best as far as vocals but the problem was he knew it. The movie showed what each of the characters had to work through if they wanted to go further in life. I especially love the scene where the monkey in the beginning gives Mike a pennie and he bullies him into giving him more money. Then, he goes on to sing Frank Sinatra's ""Pennies from Heaven"". It highlights how he fails to connect emotionally and spiritually with his music and basically just uses his gift to serve his own ego. ",5jhnth

The movie has a ton of female characters.  In fact, this author criticizes the movie for having too many characters total.

> So hear this: “Sing” is a film that’s designed to placate children rather than enrich or inspire them. Illumination’s target audience may be too young to know how awful their latest movie is, but they’ll never watch it when they grow older, they’ll never cherish it as a source of nostalgia. They’ll simply grow up expecting less of the movies, less of the world around them, and less of themselves. No big deal.

> And hey, some of these characters are cute! And it’s fun to hear famous people sing. So what if the koala is running a carwash! It’s just a cartoon. Relax. That herky-jerky Laika stuff seems kinda weird, don’t you think? What the hell is a “Kubo,” anyway? “How the Grinch Stole Christmas?” Now those are words I’ve heard, in that order, before! “Despicable Me 3?” Sounds like an afternoon I won’t have to hire a babysitter. “The Secret Life of Pets 2?” What is that dog still not telling us?

Then the rest of the movie is him trying to get resources for his theater by immoral means:

Begging the sheep for his parents' money.

Intruding on the sheep's family matters by visiting the rich aunt uninvited, again, begging for money.

Powering his theater using the neighbor's electricity.

Stealing water from the city for his enormous fish tank.

The entire movie he's using others to bail himself out for being a failure as a theater owner. And what does the movie do? They reward him at the end by making the aunt buy him the property! The message I got from his storyline is that you don't work hard and honest for what you want, instead you use others and wait to get handed to you what you want (no matter how big of a mess you are).

Edit: Had to add, I found it laughable that they depicted the bank representative as the enemy. Even before she came into the final act, I thought to myself ""isn't the theater the bank's property now?"" I was impressed that the movie acknowledged this fact at all, but they still depicted the bank representative as the enemy when she warned the Koala that they're tresspassing.

dbq3z5n,"You do know that pretty much every person uses pitch correction, right? It drastically reduces the number of takes it needs to record and splice to make the vocals of anything work perfectly. That's just how the recording industry works now, and more often than not, its used as sparsely as possible to avoid any noticeable digital sounds in the vocal recording.

We seriously need to get away from this stigma that autotune is bad. It's really, really not. It's only bad when it's used excessively to make a performer sound decent enough for a recording. It can even be used as an artistic choice to create a new sound. See: T-Pain, Cher, Kesha, all of whom are really talented vocalists, but have used tons of autotune to create a certain sound in their music.

And, yes, there is autotune on Seth's voice as well. He is a very talented vocalist, obviously, but of course no one is perfect enough for a one take and done, that is unless you want a raw sound like that in your recording, but that's not the case here.

Though I say Seth's wasn't/was barely tuned because I actually heard the inconsistencies in his. And because his live is basically the same as his recording.

Reese's I say was the most studio magic (not just autotune), followed by Scarlett, Taron, Tori, and Seth.
