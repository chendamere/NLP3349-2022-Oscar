• The lack of shitty Bourne-style micro-edits during hand-to-hand fight scenes, you could actually see what was going on, and the insane amount of rehearsal that went into the fights. You seriously gotta thank the filmmakers for that.

• The 'lowkey' silenced gun battle between Cassian and Wick in the subway concourse. Two dudes sniping at each other with 'silent' guns while the public remains oblivious. Totally ridiculous and stupid, but who cares.

• Peter Stormare rehashing the pencil story. The whole theater cracked up.

ddlucx4,"John Wick: Chapter 2 is the only action film I've ever seen that truly understands muscle memory. It's not a plot device, but rather a symphonic language expressed through violence.

Fighters have tendencies. When instinct takes over, they rely on their bread and butter. John Wick: Chapter 2 embraces this concept by allowing certain traits to repeat as connective tissue, bridging gaps between emphatic head-shots. Some will see this as repetition, but I disagree. It solidifies John Wick as a character.

He is a killing machine—highly trained and finely tuned. He understands what works.",5t4u0w
ddk69qt,Oh man! I want this movie to do well so we get Chapter 3 and round out the Wick trilogy. Don't know if that was the plan from the beginning but this feels like a great middle chapter to a trilogy. A fairly bittersweet ending that leaves room for our hero to redeem himself. ,5t4u0w

- John Wick in gun-thief mode because he got no ammo
- ""Enter the Dragon"" mirror level but with GUNS
- *worldbuilding*

Not to mention the movie was beautifully shot and all the characters had their own quirks and small details to flesh them out. I honestly didn't expect the production crew to pump out a sequel that surpassed the original but they did it somehow. One thing I'm not really clear on though is who's paying the (doubled) bounty on John Wick since Santino is dead? Is it the Continental since John broke it's rules?",5t4u0w

ddke7zb,"Just got back; my favorite running rag from the first movie continued in the sequel; pretty much everyone knows and recognizes John Wick just by his face. 

That leads me to the way this movie does its worldbuilding, which was hilarious to me. No matter how improbable, it would appear half the population are part of the criminal underground. Actually, honestly, I don't even think it's an ""underground"" anymore. And I love how somehow mundane it ends up being.

There's a scene where a bounty is placed on Wick. It isn't handled by shady men in suits or anything like that; it's handled by middle-aged bespectacled women over the phone, like it's some boring customer service issue. Except, they're dealing with bounty-hunting, and all these seemingly ordinary women have badass tattoos on their hands. So they're all likely hardened criminals in their own right. 

And when the bounty goes out, you get a montage of a bunch of random people on the streets seeing the message that has just the name and bounty. No picture of Wick. But of course, they all recognize him on sight, and he has to watch out for every random passerby, before they kill him.

Or another thing; it turns out at least some of the hobos on the streets of New York are packing heat, and part of the underground network that apparently controls half the city.

It kind of makes me feel like calling this a sort of odd urban fantasy; there's all these shenanigans going on in the cracks of the ordinary city. There's a government, and a special currency they all accept. There's this guy Wick contacts that gets him ancient maps and keys! The idea of the setting was just so amusing for me, in addition to the action, which was great too.",5t4u0w

ddk5f1l,"This is hauntingly similar to *The Raid 2*. As in, it improves on the original, evolves beyond being *just* a straightforward action film, has a myriad of action sequences that punctuate the narrative evenly, and comes with a compelling story that builds on/around the events of the first film without rehashing it.

The only 'dumb' part is the end, when practically everyone on the planet is supposedly an assassin or involved with the Continental/High Table ecosystem, but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief due to the context of the crazy events in both films, where John kills over 200 people without causing a worldwide terrorist incident.",5t4u0w
ddk9gu8,"I love how realistically John handled each firearm. The way he constantly pulls out the magazine to check how many rounds are in, the way he slightly pulls back the slide to see if a round is chambered, realistically reloading a shotgun. Everything seemed so real, unlike other action movies where guns have unlimited ammo. The only thing they didn't really portray realistically were the suppressors. In the movie, they were firing suppressed weapons indoors near civilians and they don't notice. In real life, they are still pretty loud. Overall, great portrayal of firearms.

If you're a firearm enthusiast, like myself, you will enjoy this movie",5t4u0w

de5sjb9,"I loved the movie, but hated the ending. Specifically, I hated how John killed Santino on hotel premises. To me, it was way out of left field and it seriously was a slap in the face to Winston (my personal favorite character). I loved the ""civility"" of the hotel rules from the first one, and John breaking the rule was unnecessary...I mean, c'mon, he's John Wick. Santino couldn't have stayed in that hotel forever.

I hate how Winston has to be an antagonist now. Winston and John obviously have a lot of respect for each other.

Here's how I would have liked it to go down:

John gets to the hotel and sees Santino and Winston.
Santino says his smug shit.
John looks at Winston, recognizes the rule, and looks back to Santino and says something along the lines of ""You can't stay in this hotel forever.""
John turns around and starts to walk away.
Santino, realizing he's trapped in a cage, draws his gun to shoot John in the back.
Winston draws his gun, shoots and kills Santino.
John, turning around and realizing what happened, looks at Winston with a ""what happens now.""
Winston smiles, and says something along the lines of ""I think the owner of this establishment will give me a pass."" (Which would have been great, because he is the owner/the maker of the rules).

Would love your guys's thoughts (good and bad). Sorry for the rant, turned fan fiction.

I just really didn't like how that ending played out. Making John Wick, THEE John Wick, break the rules in order to get his guy, sort of demystifies the strength and power of him. It showed that even he couldn't do the job without breaking a rule. ",5t4u0w
ddkdx0g,"I think this started weaker than John Wick 1 but ended much stronger.

The car chase scenes and a few fight scenes involved more cuts than the previous movie but that was an aim to increase the epicness of the movie. I also did dislike how many people John Wick shot off-screen. In 1 you see 100% of his kills, in JW2 not so much. 
I find a lot of action movies don't know how to balance action and pauses. Non-stop action is exhausting and hard to maintain as exciting, but John Wick pausing to reload or switch weapons adds a lot of tension. Though I was a bit confused at the beginning [with John Wick normally being a headshot machine, it becomes clear that he's hear to set an example but not kill the guys who bought his car. It was great to see Wick be smart and shot the final guy in the legs, as he probably couldn't take in hand to hand and leave him alive - those leg shots were a courtesy](#spoiler).

In the first movie, Wick had all of the agency as he was after the guy who killed his dog. In this movie, all of the main characters have an agenda they wish to fulfill, desires and stakes. This makes for a much better cast of characters, instead of JW, Carman, Son, Father and a whole bunch of thugs that want to die - each character is established as wanting something with the goal usually accomplished with someone's death. What I didn't like was Wick was without agency for the first part of the movie; however,  as soon as he [fulfilled his oath](#spoiler)... Game on! 

If you wanted to know more about the society of assassins, this movie delivers. If you want ridiculous action but also great stuff, this movie definitely delivers. It brought a 100 Bullets/Wanted comics feel to the big screen, which is why I understand some people won't like it. I definitely got a better idea of the various Guilds within the Society though it murders my head canon of Ninja Assassin ninjas being the bankers of the underground. How else do you make a society obey a bunch of stupid coins? Fucking Ninjas! Oh well...

I wanted there to be a JW2 but didn't see a need for one. This movie somewhat answers why there should be a sequel (besides it did well in the box office). But oh man, it definitely sets up for a sequel while still fulfilling all of the threads in this movie.

If I have a couple of minor gripes, the shoot-out at the rave was phenomenal, but once they moved into the tunnels it was a little too dark.

di8wgvg,"What i did like was how the opening of the movie shows you John being in the hunter of the night going after this guy on a bike, whereas the closing of the movie shows you him going from the hunter to the position of the hunted. 

Also we also get to see that John's turned into this hungry blood sucking vampire killing almost everybody who gets in his way. Towards the final act of the movie when he's in the house of mirrors we're shown in a very figurative manner how John has become his own worst enemy. 

The scene in the catacombs was a bit of a disappointment for me, it wasn't as good as the nightclub scene from the first movie. But this movie still managed to be a worthy sequel and i actually loved it more then the first one. This one really focused on who John wick is. The first movie was a revenge tale. This one was a character driven tale. Showing us who John is when he's pushed to his limits. 

I'm actually excited for part 3 and how john will recover from the big bounty on his head.

I especially liked how they really took those moments to show off John wicks skill with weapons because it shows just how much dedication and practice Reeves puts into the role. That couple finger shotgun reload is not easy to do. 

My favorite thing about these films is that the filmmakers know that they can take the film seriously but also realize the ridiculousness of it, like when the Italian continental managers only concern is if wick is after the pope.

But then again who doesn't want to watch a movie about a lone wolf who is about to be hunted without any useful allies? It will be interesting to see the next one. Not sure if it will be too unbelievable to the point of feeling like a crackfic-style movie or actually make enough sense for it to thrill. But I'm curious enough to want to watch the next. 

As for his character... Kind of makes me wonder how he became such an infamous hitman. Like what makes him so different than all of the others. His characterisation is cloudy. Not wanting to be back but then absolutely slaying even though he was gone from the scene for four years...? It's just a movie though, right? Made to show some badass mostly cold assassin go batshit. 

Also I didn't get the stuff with the pigeon man though. 7 bullets for 7 million... uh... okay?? He basically uses them all in two seconds and then that's it. Would've thought there was more to it at least? Nope. 

Oh right and the Russian dude at the beginning. His dialogue made me laugh. OH I JUST THOUGHT. Will he be an ally or something in the next? The whole 'peace' thing.

And that woman's suicide. He said it would be impossible but then to get one of the bosses alone is easy? I get the fight afterwards but that was too easy.

ddlqh0k,"Just a bit of a brain dump here as I try to parse through all of this. John Wick is greek mythology masquerading as a neon techno noir action movie.

So John Wick obviously is an angel of death. He drives a black 1969 Ford Mustang aka he is riding a dark horse. Is his dog a reference to Cerberus?

I'm betting that Winston (Ian McShane) is Hades, New York is the Underworld, The Hudson River is the River Styx, The Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and the homeless people are the lost souls that are trapped in limbo between life and death, the gold coins represent the coins that are paid to Charon the Ferryman to cross into the Underworld, hell, according to IMDB Lance Reddick's name is Charon...

Maybe all of this is obvious. But there are a lot of allusions I am struggling to unpack.

What do the 7 bullets and the 7 million dollars represent? The hellish underground layer of mirrors? Who does Santino D’Antonio and his sister Gianna represent?

Or am I just reading too much into it?",5t4u0w
ddka0p8,"Jeeeeesus Christ, what a great movie. Easily one of the coolest action movies I've seen. The amount of technical fighting/shooting in this movie absolutely blew my mind. One of the few sequels that, in my opinion, surpasses the original.",5t4u0w
ddkg4iu,"An excellent follow up that keeps the same jaw-dropping style of the original, but covers enough new ground to stand on its own without trampling on what made the original feel so special. It was fun diving into the underworld that was teased last time around, the gunplay and cinematography were everything I hoped for, and it promises an exciting future for the series. This is a much more open-ended film, and sets many events in motion that aren't resolved by the time the credits roll.

I have to wonder where the next installment will take us, though. The last scene in particular left me with a lot of questions. I find it immensely curious that Winston gives John a marker in the final scene. What use does a marker have to a man who is no longer bound by those rules? It could simply be returning the now completed marker to him, but I have to wonder if it's something more. He also makes a very pointed display of his influence by filling the park with people under his command, but agrees with John's assertion that he'll kill anyone who comes after him, making me doubt it was intended as a threat. Winston seems to care about John, from trying to warn him against re-entering the underground in the first film, to the hour's head start before excommunication. With McShane and Reddick reported to have substantial roles in the plans for the next movie, I can only hope that the Continental crew have a plan to help bring the perpetually un-retired hitman safely back into the fold.

Movie was action packed, the universe which was a huuuuugggge part of the first movie was fleshed out even more, and the minor characters were solid and memorable.

ddlwmle,"LOVED it. The only thing I didn't enjoy as much as I did in the first film was the music and judging by these comments, I seem to be in the minority. I own the score of the first film. Tyler Bates is fantastic. But I felt that a lot of the score was rehashed. The first one also gave us Kaleida's ""Think"", The Candy Shop Boys ""Evil Man Blues"", M86 & Susie Q's ""In My Mind"", Ciscandra Nostalghia's ""Who You Talkin' To Man?"" and of course Marilyn Manson's ""Killing Strangers""

Whereas in the second one, we only got two Ciscandra songs. I wanted more music by random, new artists. You can't tell me you're not imagining the club scene the second you hear Kaleida's Think. I felt that there's no such scene that stood out like that in the second one.

One of the things I really liked about it was that it sort of did all the things I didn't want it to do, but knew that it had to do.  It was the obvious way for the story to go (ie-[John being the one who breaks the rules knowing what the outcome would be, even though he didn't really have any other choice](#spoiler)), and it was done at a very high quality.

It almost seemed like this one took place in a new reality where 40% of the world's population are essentially assassins, which was a bit ridiculous - Literally, everyone from a busker to a homeless guy was somehow related to this elitist criminal ring. Additionally, the police were nonexistent, and people's reactions to violence and gunfights were very unrealistic. A great example of this is the one scene where wick and common have a gun fight in the subway and nobody notices - you can hear the silencers yourself, they are not completely quiet, and maybe it was just me, but watching that scene felt weird, as if the people were ignoring it on purpose. To me anyways, it just felt like they didn't try.

At first, I was a bit let down with the sequel hook at the end of the movie since that means we wait to see what will happen to John.
But pondering back (I may sound bias), the cliffhanger kinda echoes back to the warnings in the first movie. The title ""Chapter Two"" makes much more sense.

""Retired? Do you really believe that?""

""...You dip as much as a pinky into this pond, you may find something reaches out and drags you back into its depths.""

""This life...follows you. It clings to you. Infecting everyone that comes close you. We are cursed, you and I""

And boy, did John went deep or what? Even the narration is more ""show, not tell"".I mean, throughout the movie we see him becoming more ruthless from one scene to the next with each beating or shot he took slowly kills his humanity and the feared Baba Yega is emerging. The car chase opening actually hints what John will go through as observed here :
[reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnWick/comments/5tqhb7/the_opening_carchase_in_jw2/)

* Mag hitting the wall in the underground tunnel when he reloaded. That one cracked me up too.

* Pinning the guy to the floor with the shotgun and loaded one more round in to finish him off.

* The whole subway scene.

ddrxclf,"I loved the movie! My main beef: when the contract goes open and international, it REALLY detracts from the feel when it seems like every tenth person walking around is a trained assassin and goes after John. In the original when John is fighting the girl outside of his hotel room and the door opens, they all know each other. It simply is too small a game from the hotel feel for every Tom Dick and Harry to be an assassin out in the streets. 

That said, I wanted more backstory into the hotel organization itself! What is this High Table, how did Winston form this whole thing, more about everything. 

Finally, the action is just so awesome that it's still great anyways. ",5t4u0w

dds50mu,"My SO pointed out something about both of the movies I really enjoyed, which is John Wick's fighting techniques. Not because they are flashy, or because they were just looking good on film but it was because of their consistency. John Wick does not magically have a new cool move for every situation...he has like 6 different moves he is REALLY good with, and against the standard ""Hired Gun"" type he can easily drop them left and right, but against other highly trained assassins he is pushed to the edge, still using his same moves while trying to find an edge to exploit.

 It makes him more human you know? Seemed more well trained instead of just hidden behind plot armor all the time",5t4u0w

diu0k44,"just watched the movies, I have a theory about the coins and markers. 

I think the coins tie in with the marker. The coins are not so much a currency but as a favor token, that would explain why one token can have such wide range of ""purchasing power"". The continental, and therefore an extension of the High Table issue the favor tokens as favors *from* the High Table. 

However what if you need more than a favor? what if you need a promise. Then the marker is involved, it is no longer a favor from the high table but a promise, brokered and enforceable by the high table.

I still haven't been able to think of a plausible reason why no-one reacts to the violence in the streets outside of maybe that near everyone is an agent and that a conflict with wick is way outside of their skillgrade and just stay uninvolved (which doesn't make too much sense). 

However I do have a theory that in this universe there is a ""one world government"" and that one world government is the high table, and the continentals are like embassies for their agents which would explain a few things including how agents loyal to different families and regions still respect the rules of each continental. I also think the ""one world government"" by the High Table would explain why there are less gang related tropes like drugs or sex-trade and its more akin to a very large collection of hit men that protect and control whatever causes that the high table so urges. 

I'm hoping that the third chapter of the movie will explore the workings of the High Table as what i can only assume, John Wick will be taking down - i think this is also hinted by the posters found in the subway scene which hint to resisting and disobeying ",5t4u0w

dihteir,"Late to the party here but one thing I really appreciated about the hand to hand combat is that they always considered size differences in how wick attacked his opponents and how effective/ineffective his attacks were based on the opponents' size. 

Example 1: the big dude at the Russian chop shop. Wick knows he has no chance so he just blasts him in the kneecaps. 

Example 2: Sumo dude. His punches and kicks were ineffective because the dude was SO much bigger than Wick, so he had to switch to the gun. 

Example 3: Bieber girl is teeny tiny so he literally throws her at one point. ",5t4u0w

ddnf2oi,"Loved it, even better than the first one imo, tho not as emotionally charged. Action and choreography is as crisp and beautifully violent as ever and in greater volume, Keanu further proving his chops as an action star. The climactic action sequence might well be one of the most stylishly shot I've seen so far. 

Absolutely fascinated by the whole underworld society they introduced in the first film and so pleased that it was given more spotlight this time around (The Continental has international branches!!), I would reaally love to see an expanded universe further exploring it (spinoff movies, comics, videogames, etc), it just seems so rich with potential for storytelling beyond Wick. 

Also, like the first film, really loved how great a job they did 'showing, not telling' just how utterly badass John Wick is. Sure, there's the opening exposition by Stromare about how Wick earned the nickname Baba Yaga, but the rest of the film displays subtly just why Wick is so feared (besides the obvious with Wick killing everybody in his way). He constantly finds himself amongst shady underworld personas and in 'villainous' hives, and usually in movies the protagonists start to feel out of their depth and wary, and the scary underworld figures try to throw their weight around and intimidate them. But Wick weaves in and out among them with such ease and familiarity, and they *all* respond to him with obvious respect, and even warmth. And even in the action sequences, Wick does things like planning ahead in case of double-crosses by setting up equipment at ambush points, and in the final sequence in the hall of mirrors where you'd expect the hero to be disoriented as a handicap, it's actually Wick who uses the environment against his foes!

The ending promises even greater escalation in the eventual sequel with the odds as high as it gets against Wick, and with their current track record so far, can't wait to see what they'll deliver. 

*Edit: ALSO, the reload porn is even sexier this time around, with several scenes showing how creative Wick is at killing people while reloading

The trailers seemed to advertise the third movie did they not? Of course they had scenes from JW2 and visually it had nothing to do with JW3, but the way the movie was presented in the trailers reminds me EXACTLY of how the third was hinted at the end of the second.

One scene stood out to me because he kills like 9 people all exactly in the same way in a row. I thought it could have worked a bit better if they let moments like [when he kills seven guys with seven bullets](#spoiler) linger a bit longer and have a bit more impact, especially after they made a big deal about it.

I would have greatly preferred it if they cut some of the longer Call of Duty style sequences a bit shorter and had some awesome fights between John and the ""mini-bosses,"" I guess?

The only thing I missed was something equivalent to the first one's ""That fucking nobody..."" speech from Viggo. And my favorite line is still the last part of [this exchange](https://youtu.be/mxcRp0e9eDA?t=227).

I had resigned myself to disappointment as I waited for this sequel. Very few sequels can equal (heh) the first film in a series, and it is rarer still in pure action franchises like this, but holy fuck, *John Wick 2* is BETTER than the original.

I also noticed there was a lot of comic relief in this movie, whereas I don't recall any ""funny"" moments in the first one. Besides that I definitely feel like there was a slight change in tone. The first movie was sheer vengeful, ass-kicking, guitar-shredding (love that soundtrack), raging bad assery. The second felt more like a very determined struggle for survival. Makes total sense, since those ARE the differences between the plots for the two movies. Also the deaths in this movie were absolutely brutal, so glad I took the chance to see it in a theater.

The world building was perfect. This was the part I was little iffy on going into the movie. Part of what made the Continental so memorable is how mysterious it was. Luckily I felt the film exposed just the right amount of new information about the rules of the continental and the numerous assassins and businesses that abide it. We still don't know everything about the Continental which is good because I'm down with the layer by layer approach in seeing new parts of the Continental.

The acting again was excellent and on point along with the characterization. Compared with this film, you can tell the antagonists from the first film were small fish compared to the ones John has to deal with. I liked the class and the professionalism they all show to one another. Most of the antagonists have a healthy respect for one another and it's obvious that it's just business until it isn't.

And of course the action, this is the main reason you go to this film given the first one was excellent in that regard. The sequel amps this up to eleven. So many memorable moments, the shotgun scene, the mirror fight, the pencil scene, the horde of assassins that come at John in New York. My personal favorite scene is when John and Cassian clashed especially their second fight. I was cackling at the scene where they were having a low key gun fight in the subway. The impression I got was them passive aggressively saying fuck you, no fuck you.

The ending was perfect and I felt it was fitting for John to kill Santino on Continental grounds. The last scene where John was running not knowing who is an assassin with his grace period of time was running out. It really showed how scary the Continental was and you could see the fear and desperation in John's eyes. It makes me wonder how he'll deal with the power of High Table and the Continental all arrayed against him considering John relied on them heavily for his missions.

What does excommunication really mean. His gold is worthless and he can't use any of the facilities of the organization, does that mean his marker is useless?

Why did Winston give him the marker? Shouldn't John have to give him one? Seems like Winston gave him a double favor?

What's with the one hour thing? An hour till Winston sends people to kill him, or an hour till the new contract for him goes up? 

EDIT:

From some other comments I like this thought best thus far:

The one hour grace period is referring to the time John has before he makes the High Table contract effective. The one issued by the friends of Santino. 

The marker is actually being returned to John and is proof that Santino ordered his sister killed. In the event he tries to prove that to somebody. It's not a favor from Winston.

dk9ue06,"Late to the thread, but I have to vent some gripes I had with the movie. I feel like everything positive about the movie was already said, so Ill focus on the negatives. I loved how JW1 was grounded in reality and still allowed John to basically be a superhuman hitman murdering waves of goons from the russian mob. In JW2 however there were so many little annoying things. 

The subway scene where John and Cassian are casually shooting at each other and nobody notices their guns or hears their guns going off (reminder - suppressed 9mm is around 120dB) or bullet holes magically appeating on walls was just so dumb. Later when they fight on the train people barely react and just sit there watching two dudes try and stab each other. And I dont mean that they ""should've done something"" but they literally just sit there barely moving. 

When it comes to the choreography of fights in the movie I couldn't help but notice that the goons that John was killing were very convenietly ""appearing"" from behind the camera, like they just spawned in a video game. Perfect example of this is the catacombs scene where John pretty much takes a break in the middle of a hallway to reload his shotgun and after a few seconds dudes magically ""spawn"" basically in front of him and are ready to be killed by the freshly reloaded shells. Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way that some of Johns moves were very repetitive: grabbing a guys arm and shooting him in the chest, doing a swirly wrestling takedown and shooting the guy in the head and so on. As much as it may show how John is a perfect assassin or something, it was pretty boring to watch.

One more thing that took me out of the movie was some pretty terrible green screen in scenes with John and Cassian where you can see a blur on the edge of their faces.

Overall I still enjoyed the movie, but some things really had me scratching my head when the credits rolled.",5t4u0w

That ending though, I feel like Winston felt like he lost a brother with having to do that to John, but he did give him an hour and we all know that Hour is all what John needs.

Just when I thought they couldn't pull me back in, the man, the myth, the legend drags me back! How good it is to see you again Mr. Wick.",5t4u0w
ddkhy4r,"There's a lot of criticism here on how much time was spent with storytelling, but for me that made it all the more immersive and enjoyable. For the third movie, and how can there not be a third movie, I question how they are going to give more depth to the universe when he is just fighting for his life the whole time.   
As great as the Continental scenes in this and the first movie we're, they can't have him immediately get back in Winston's good graces, although I would hope they would end the next movie that way... somehow. Which means the whole movie will almost certainly be them backing the writers into a corner.   
This one was definitely entertaining though and of course we need more Laurence Fishburne. Since this series is supposedly supposed to be a trilogy. It's fitting that at least two (since unfortunately it's too late for all three) movies to feature both Reeves and Fishburne.",5t4u0w
ddlb527,Chapter 3 is gonna be a doozy.,5t4u0w
ddlonn0,"Really liked it.

The slow walk, covert silencer stare down fight was awesome.

The only thing it didn't do as well as the original, was the kind of scene from the Red Circle Bar in the first.

Specifically as he's killing guards on his way in, when he stares that one guy to death as he stabs him and he slides to the ground as the music plays. That was just visual poetry.",5t4u0w
ddlr8my,"I think overall the first movie is better, but this is the more interesting one. This movie really reminds me of the Wuxia movies and TV shows I watched as a kid living in China. In Wuxia fiction, people of martial prowess are often depicted more like demigods than normal everyday people, and they usually exist in a kind of parallel sub-society called Jianghu (""rivers and lakes""), not unlike the criminal underworld in this movie. This movie even has a homeless faction, which is reminiscent of the beggar's clan that's very prevalent in Wuxia fiction. ",5t4u0w
ddlvvan,"I haven't seen it said yet, but the John Wick movies really bring Every Frame A Painting's video about Jackie Chan to mind, specifically that, for all his prowess, John Wick still occasionally fucks up and, most importantly, he can be hurt, either emotionally or physically. John Wick gets hurt, and not just hurt like the whole ""getting shot through the shoulder so the protagonist takes one meaningful injury"". Keeping it super simple, John gets stabbed in the leg and gut, and gets shot multiple times, and he has this look like ""son of a bitch, that fucking hurt"" on his face. Even during his return to New York, and all the other assassins have it out for him, we see John kind of throw in the towel when he tosses the coin to the bum assassin. He's tired, hurt, limping like a motherfucker, and he just doesn't want to fucking deal with this bullshit for like, half a goddamned second, fuck. It shows that, for all his precision, deadly grace, and lethality, John Wick is still human. Admittedly, after this chapter, John Wick feels especially god-like, but I'm willing to let it slide because of the length the worldbuilding has gone towards building up the legacy and legend of John Wick and his exploits.

All told, I thought John Wick: Chapter 2 was a solid addition to the series. I have seen people equate it and the first movie to The Raid and The Raid: Redemption, which I think is pretty apt. Both are solid movies that definitely have their strong points and weak points, but you can't deny that the action scenes and fight choreography are intense, engaging, and just straight up fun to watch.",5t4u0w
ddmbsrv,"This movie made me realize why I never liked action movies: Because none set the bar as high as John Wick.
I plan on seeing it again at the theatre. The story and atmosphere got me hooked.  Every environment was different than the previous one and posed new problems to John Wick. I liked seeing a different enemy (the Italians as opposed to Russians) this time. The fight sequences were great, the camera was panning instead of cutting. The movie started slowly, but it kept building up until a point where the audience really felt like John was fucked. That's great because it makes John look vulnerable. Keanu Reeves was perfect as John Wick again of course. I love the way he portrays the character.

I also realized how they foreshadowed the plot the first time the audience is introduced to Winston in the first movie. 'you dip a pinky into this pond and you'll see something grab you back in'. Such a cool moment actually, Winston was warning him.

The only thing that bothered me was how Winston was able to control everyone in the park at the end. The audience already knows Winston is a powerful character, there was no need to reaffirm it. I also hope we will see the mute girl and Cassian in the third movie, I feel like having enduring antagonists might help the third movie.

I feel like Winston is Wick's father for some reason because why else help him this much? It doesn't really make sense. I'm really excited for the third movie, I hope it will come soon.",5t4u0w

ddt78zg,"Great film, there didn’t seem to be a single moment that wasn’t made with care. I love how they didn’t go further into his backstory and how he became the man he is (I’m happy we still don’t know what his “impossible task” was), but at the same time they did delve more into the criminal underworld while still keeping it’s mystery intact. And I really appreciated how the intentions of each character were always clear and believable. And of course, each fight scene was just beautifully shot and SO MUCH FUN to watch. 

However, I loved Viggo in the first John Wick. I loved his lawyer, Avi, and his son, Iosef. I could understand these characters and actually felt a lot of empathy for them because in that movie there didn’t seem to be any traditional villains. The closest would be Iosef who was misguided and arrogant, like a sheltered child. But everyone in that movie seemed to be fully human with moments of vulnerability. Specially Viggo, who was a father who was ashamed by his own son but still accepted him until death. He was complex, he was charming, he had a code that he lived by. I felt like every character in the first John Wick had great growth, while as in John Wick 2 there was nothing that a character did that was particularly surprising. But overall it was a fantastic movie deserving of all of the praise it's getting.",5t4u0w

And this motherfucker thinks blowing up his house is a good idea.

I also love how you can see why he's called the devil and the boogey man etc. He's an honorable assassin and all that, but you fuck with him and he'll slowly push that knife into your heart and watch you in the eye as he does it, fucking brutal.

But it had awesome action in it so I can't complain too much. Good sequel.

I loved how in most of the public fight scenes, everyone around them is oblivious to what's going on. Not running away or anything just like ""oh, these two people are having a knife fight in the middle of this train that's going on NBD."" Or that John had blood on his face the entire time.

Not quite as cartoonish as the whole themed gangs, but Laurence Fishburn's bum gang definitely has that feel, and the distinctness of the different assassins also lent to that.

I also loved how it starts with a Buster Keaton movie being projected against a building, and the bicycle in the movie basically cutting into the motorcycle from the opening sequence.

This definitely had the best fight scene of the two (mirror museum), however I felt the first one was more consistently badass with the club and the house before the grand finale. Also I wasn't a huge fan of Fishburne's overacting (i get its part of the character but felt sorta lame to me)

So how does killing John tie up any loose ends? 

Also at the end with the doubled hit… so the council cares enough about it's members to put up $14m for killing D’Antonio, but the murder of the sister was apparently never investigated? I might have been misunderstanding that one, they went through it pretty fast.

It also showed the flaws of revenge and not just letting someone get one over on you sometimes. Everyone in this movie tried to get revenge for something done to them by someone else and each of them end up in a worst place at the end because of it.

John wanted revenge for his dog? It got him put back into the Assassin game. Common wanted revenge for his girl? It got him stabbed in the stomach on a bus. John refused to just let what happened go for now and wait? He got ex communicated for it.

I think what made john wick good it was just about him and his quest for vengeance for his dog which was a very pure and personal character motive.

My only complaint if I have any is that they made the criminal world a little too big IMO.

ddm0675,"Just got back from seeing it. I loved the first one and these easily follows it up and perhaps replaces John Wick as one of the best action movies ever. The action scenes were good. Every single one was amazing and seemed like a new idea as well. The script and story was tight and smart, much more concerned with the world of John Wick and the Continental rather than the plot, which was well set up and wasn't a rehash of the original. I would say character motivations were stronger in the first, and that is the only thing I felt like the first did much better, everything else is John Wick turned to 11. The acting was solid, even Common felt at home in this world, an actor I'm not typically fond of. If I could make one gripe, I would say I expected more hitmen to surrender or avoid John Wick... just felt silly how many people willingly entered the slaughter. I loved the humour to this film as well, very self aware but not to an irritating or cringe level. Slight nods to the actors and the filmmakers who clearly love film and stunt work. This movie was definitely a love letter to stuntmen and women (the buster Keaton projection in the opening scene made that pretty apparent).

New York was great as well. High point the fight with common.

Love that the final scene was him running away instead of running to something. You know that means that he's actually scared for once. 

Unbelievably fun movie. And that cinematography, so many comicbook style shots. 

Also I wanna point out, one of my favourite shots was at the beginning, where you see that under the pistols and gold coins he pulled out in the first film, is a bunch of rifles and a grenade launcher (I think?) .

Great music, awesome visuals: the flashing cuts, the scenery, even the colors (never thought I'd say that, but this movie is vivid and bright with colors) are soooo good; intense fighting and shoot-out scenes, and probably the best car scenes I've ever seen (like you can totally believe Keanu was in that car all the time the way it was shot).

The only problem I had with the first movie were childish stupid dialogues with cliches and redundant phrases like ""yeah I think I'm back!"", but this one seems to tone it down a bit in favor of action. 

Awesome. 10/10. Can't wait for the next one",5t4u0w
ddlnuu1,"Definitely a movie worth seeing in the theater for the crowd reactions. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but the sequel improves on it in pretty much every way (especially the minimalist but compelling world-building). The point, of course, is the action sequences, which are beautifully shot -- naturally there's no real suspense about whether or not John Wick is going to kill every dude in the room, but *how* is he gonna do it? If you watched the first one, then yeah, we get to see the pencil trick in JW2, and it does not disappoint.

ddmod7t,"I really enjoyed it, but I'm wondering about the premise. 

Why did Santino ever bother involving John Wick to begin with? There didn't seem to be a whole lot of impossibleness about the assassination. John had several clear views of Santino's sister (like when he was standing on the column while she walked through the courtyard), and then simply ended up walking into her room. 

The most difficult part was escaping, but if Santino wanted the assassin to die after the fact, sending a less skilled assassin would have benefited him. John also left most of his equipment in the tunnels, and was seemingly most prepared to fight down there after the assassination. So again, why bother sending John Wick?

Onto the movie though, can someone explain the ending?  I'm a bit confused.  How did Winston seemingly ""control"" those people when they all stared at John?  Was it meant to showcase Winston's power over the city?  I really have no idea.

Also, that marker at the end that Winston gave John doesn't make sense to me either.  Any thoughts?

I did not like the ending scene at the modern museum (?) I found he mirrors to be annoying and gave me a headache. It took away from the thrill as I was just waiting for the final showdown to be over. Otherwise I did enjoy the action scenes, but the beginning one takes the cake for me. Another issue I had is that it seemed like there were a TON of fellow assassins suddenly popping up. I loved the chase scenes with them going after John but it almost took me out of the moment. I get it's NYC and densely populated but I had to laugh at how many were desperate for 7 million bucks to take out someone like John Wick.

Overall I think it rivals the first film and builds on top of it. 8.5/10",5t4u0w
ddnwr5i,"Kind of confused on the timeline of things and I was hoping someone could clarify:

1. Am I correct in assuming that Wick's visit to the taxi warehouse was shortly after the conclusion of the 1st movie (which is how he retrieved his car)?

2. If 1 is correct, where does the timeline of the bike scene at the beginning of the movie fit?

3. I'm still not entirely clear by the excommunicado note. Does that mean he had an hour to run free before the executioners would seek him out? Was this just a courtesy by the Manager? If so, why?",5t4u0w

Blade was half indie, people with a vision but not a full budget taking a really good shot at it.

That is John Wick 2: a perfection of John Wick 1.

Plus Abram Tarasov is the only character in the second movie he made peace with when he stood in his office giving him a shot of vodka.

They did a gun fight in a mirror exhibit. The world building is more expansive than the first one and you can see how The Assassins's guild work, internationally. 

The one thing that disappointing in this movie was the main villain. He was not as compelling as the first one. In the first one, you can see Michael Nyqvist's character is afraid to screw with John Wick, In this movie, Santino just tell John to did the job and after that, he just betrayed him without further information why he wanted to betrayed him in the first place. His motives was not clear enough for me.

Overall the movie was pretty decent and better than the first one in many ways.

The two big massacre sequences and the 1v1 between John and Cassian were wonderful, but a lot of the world building fell short. In the first there certainly a sense of hyper-reality but the NY sequence with all the hitmen was JARRING. 

I REALLY didn't like the bit with the fountain where John blindly fires into a fucking crowd. Completely out of character and makes him much harder to root for when he's haphazardly spraying down civilians. That whole sequence...ugh, how did that make it past script revision? Just terrible. 

Also; what the shit was up with Winston's flash-mob moment at the end? What was the purpose of that? The practicality? So he had hundreds of assassins in his employ pretend to be civilians, whilst somehow keeping all ACTUAL civilians out of the park, so they could all freeze and stare at John for five seconds? As what, a show of power? Why would John need to be convinced of Winston's reach, shouldn't John have intimate knowledge of Winston's capabilities by now? Not to mention that, given the nature of the conversation, why even threaten John in the first place when you're going to just let him go? The fuck? That whole scene made ZERO sense. It straight up TRIGGERED me.

You're one of the most realistic action franchises (and still are), but don't go all 80s cheese on us yet. Also the shotgun count was a but off, pistols still Aces. 

Other than that, and the fact that Ruby Rose and Fishburne were minimal, I had a blast. Also the pencil kills were so gratifying. 


The prep Montage with the tailor and the gunsmith were so grand. The continued world building is the best thing the Wick series has established, other than action of course.

ddvpilr,"This is an action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Love interest? Nope. John Wick's only mistress is death. Reeves, with his special brand of blank face acting delivers the perfect [stony faced expressions] (http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/14/14577884/keanu-reeves-action-star-john-wick-matrix) while dishing out beautifully choreographed justice. 

The movie's greatest strength can also be misconstrued as it's biggest weakness. It's a straightforward action flick. Nothing more, nothing less. What it lacks in a love story and plot, it makes up for with **nonstop** action, [amazingly shot](http://actionagogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/john-wick-2-6.jpg) scenes, and a mysterious [underground world](http://screenrant.com/john-wick-world-guide-continental-sommelier/) that leaves you wanting more.

To me, John Wick is the anti-bond. There's no love interest, international terrorist villain, or inner demon that our protagonist has to deal with. He doesn't worry about law or governments, and his only regulation is a Contstantine-esque like underground organization of assasins. Even then, this organization fears and respects him. He's a man surrounded by mystery, and I don't want the movie to ruin his mystique. I want it to tease me with more vague details. I want to ask why, not be presented with a cut and dry history of this underground world.  

The director gives you only the facts: He is a man of focus. A man of dedication. Of pure. Fucking. Will. John Wick is a man that doesn't waste words. He's a killing machine, and you, the viewer are told this right in the beginning of the movie. If you expect more, you'll be disappointed. 

TL;DR: The movie delivers on it's promise: A visually stunning collection of well choreographed fights between well dressed, attractive people.  It explores the mysterious world that John Wick left behind, and is intent on dragging him back in.

ddlrman,"I actually like this more than John Wick 1. While I think the beginning of the first film was stronger and John's motivations stronger, I felt that the action was better here. The best scenes in John Wick 1 were the shootout in his house and at the club. I feel like this film had its action scenes better paced and spread out.

The world was also developed a lot more in this one. We get to see a lot more of how wide spread the Continental is and powerful and varied it is.

I initially thought it was a bit silly how unbelievably good silencers were that nobody could even notice two people coyly shooting each other, but then again, when 1 in every 5th person is an assassin or bodyguard or gangster, weapons technology probably becomes really darn good.

ddlsw4w,"I didn't really give a shit about anything that happened before Santino put the hit on Wick. They said the mission was impossible but he kind of just took the ""secret"" passageway that is readily available for purchase? Common left her unguarded. Obviously she asked him to leave but wouldn't he be listening at the door or something? 

Also, the ending. Is everyone in NY an assassin? It was cool to see that society expanded. But by the end I felt like my buddies and I were the only ones who didn't get invited to the club. 

Other than that I enjoyed the movie. Having Fishburne's dirty hobo assassin league was a cool contrast to the high society, diamond eating killers in Rome. 

I also really enjoyed the music. Especially in the museum scene. Speaking of the museum, I believe the statue Santino stands by a couple times is Hercules killing his family. If so, that was clever considering he put a hit on his sister. The other statues seemed to be the Pantheon of gods, which he clearly considered himself in. 

You could tell Reeves put in the work with this movie (as he always does). It also seemed like the actors were having fun with their roles which generally makes for great performances. I'd like to see Common return for JW3, hopefully he found someone to plug up his aorta. ",5t4u0w

Would Santino have gotten the power over NYC Winston could've gotten into problems also. Even though Winston is rocking the rock-hard act in the cellar when he comes to fulfill the marker for Jonathan the threat Santino is making about the Continental does hold value against Winston.

In this film that level of emotion isn't there, which leaves the particular decision confusing. On one hand it showed the flaw of that rule, considering the contract presumably would never end if Santonio stayed within the safety of the Continental, but I can't see John breaking a rule that he knows would have dire consequences.

2) Anybody notice the little pins on some of the assassins' lapels?  Also on the keys to the catacombs he is given by the map guy.  It's this symbol http://www.thirdreichmedals.com/article/anti-partisan.html Which could be either they just liked the design and stole it or it has deeper meaning, like what the anti-partisan medal was awarded for: The award was intended to recognize those who had taken part in combating the growing Partisan menace which was causing so much disruption in the areas occupied by the German armed forces along with her Allies.

In similar fashion to how I feel about The Raid movies, I prefer the second and how they expanded upon what were in my opinion good but improvable first efforts.

Was lacking a bit of logic in places but overall I really really liked this like 8/10. The cinematography and production design was crazy. Keanu is a beast. The ending had me ridiculously hyped for part 3.

Before anybody throws hate my way I do still like the first movie but found the action in it a bit repetitive in the fact that it seemed to be just headshot headshot headshot, I like how the gun usage seemed more varied here and also more hand to hand stuff which is what I love.

ddknyin,"[DISCLAIMER: This comment has an **ass load of spoilers. You have been warned.**]

I've been let down by many sequels before... but this movie? The last time I enjoyed a sequel was The Godfather II. I saw it for the first time not that long ago, though, so it hasn't been that long.

John Wick 2 is everything John Wick was, multiplied by 2. The action scenes are back, with bigger sets, longer bouts, and twice the numbers and ferocity (he's fighting other hitmen in this one, for goodness sake!). The expansion of this story's universe was also great. This underworld of assassins span the world, and even more aspects of it are shown without it convulsing what the first one established. Apart from the action, Wick's universe is what hooked me onto this franchise, and I am very glad they handled it with care.

Also wasn't mad about the new cast introduced here. Again, they fall on the same aspect of great world building. I got jitters from the hitman hunt scene, especially the violin lady. Hell, the assassins of this world are true assassins, in that they know how to blend in with the environment. Cassian was a dope character, representing another stalemate character for John. I was definitely expecting him to help John along the way in this movie, but with the way the movie ends I'm guessing he returns for the third one. Ruby Rose was OK--she wasn't as tough as I expected because she was always fought behind a barrier of dispensable men, and her final fight ended pretty damn quickly.

Gotta give quick props to the opening scene. Apart from connecting the first movie to this one in a short amount of time, it also gives viewers who haven't seen the first one a quick rundown of the events prior. It also cleans up a good amount of plots the first movie left, all the while putting you right into the action seat. Great handling, I must say again.

I wasn't mad about the final events of the movie, at all. We finally get to see John crack, as he kills a crime lord in Continental grounds. Not one strike, but two. He's set his grave for the final movie to come, and I think I've an idea on how that'll end.

With all the cheers I've said though, I did have a few gripes with this movie. Firstly, that ballistic suit jacket. Apart from working as literal plot armor, it never broke down. Shit was made out of futuristic material, because jeez... it never got destroyed. I'd have expected it to have limited use, especially with the amount of bullets he sustained. Yeah, he had two suits made, but I didn't think those things would take so much bullets.

Secondly, since John's been squaring off with fellow assassins here, I noticed they never went for headshots like he did. But honestly, the more I type it out the more I realize that this movie definitely has fictional elements to it, akin to a graphic novel. John's plot armor is his will to survive. After this movie, I pretty much summed it up to his unwavering focus, just like what the Russian dude said in the beginning. John Wick's a death-dealing monk.

I was sort of surprised by how much leeway Winston gave him for his excommunication. Which has led me to question... why does he have so much favors? Apart from serving as another plot armor, the movie doesn't really explain it too well. I guess it's because he's great at what he does--at what they do. He must've really done something during his peak to have created that type of reputation. And, with the conclusion of the movie, Wick's favors have been expunged... but not completely. Dammit, how will they answer this in the third movie?

Welp, this wall of text proves how much I loved this movie. I don't ever spend my money on a movie ticket twice, but with this sequel, I am eager to watch it again very soon. Chapter 2 was great, and now I can't help but wonder when and how the third one will pan out.",5t4u0w
ddk8zyc,"While the action was decent, the story wasn't as good as the first one. The scenes where they would put out a contract were over the top.

On top of the amazing action scenes, we got amusing dialogue, extremely memorable characters, and amazing cinematography. The movie felt long, but it was because it had so much goodness in it.

ddn6res,"John Wick is one of my favorite movies ever, I love it with all my heart. Chapter 2 is fantastic and I watched it the whole time with a grin on my face. But I have a big problem with the ending and I'm hoping someone can offer a different perspective to help me reconcile the choice to have John shoot Santino in the Continental. 

Acting impulsively with no concern for consequences is out of character for John. Obviously Santino was an idiot for trying to take out John after he killed the sister (why did he do that? was he really just doing his brotherly duty as he said?), but I don't see why John couldn't walk away from that moment and bide his time. Plus Winston has always had his back, and I don't get why he would put Winston in that situation. 

I also think the Continental should have a rule against putting out a hit on someone then taking safe harbor inside, that was such a pussy move and the contract should be void.

I'm thrilled that they set up a third movie, but this ending doesn't sit right with me because I can't come up with a way to wrap my brain around John taking that shot. If you guys have a different perspective, I'll be grateful to hear it because I'm definitely going to see this again next week.

Edit: Thanks to everyone for these takes, a lot of great points here. I guess I thought that conducting business on the grounds of the Continental meant automatic death because of what happened to Perkins, but I'm hearing people say the management has some discretion and could choose excommunication instead. And it's possible John didn't care in that moment if killing Santino meant signing his own death warrant. The main sticking point for me is that he betrayed Winston, but maybe I'm overestimating the friendship there. Just because I think Winston always had John's back doesn't mean John felt he owed him anything. I'm excited to see it again with all of this in mind.",5t4u0w

di92z65,"I wanted to love this movie...but there were too many unintentionally laugh-out-loud scenes for me. Plus, Keanu's acting is brutal. Director needed to ask more from him in that department (action wise, Keanu needs no help...probably one of the best out there). But even with minimal dialogue he seems to have trouble delivering it normally. I get the character is reserved and in full-business mode but that doesn't mean each line has to be delivered as if it's in isolation with no conversational flow to it. Everyone around him, even Common, is able to sound normal while Keanu has to say everything in a stilted fashion.

About those laugh-out-loud scenes: 

- that shoot out scene while they're walking in the subway...how is it that nobody hears nor notices them doing that. We know silencers are not that quiet.

- everyone is a secret assassin now? Looks like everyone in the city got the message right to their phone. And I guess you can't walk 2 meters without running into one staring you down.

- what was with that awkward scene where Gianna D'Antonio is walking down the isle with her bodyguards. Long and poorly done to convey that she is a powerful character.

- So why is Fishburne's character in this? I get it, he has a powerful underground empire of fake bums. But does John Wick really need his help in locating Santino? 

- cliche Jewish jewelers scene where they have a safe for clients.

- cliche hall of mirrors scene (enjoyed the action in it though for the most part)

Also it would've been nice for the henchman to go out in a spectacular way like in Bond films. Here, it was very anticlimactic...stabbed just like Common

ddnkeg5,"As probably everybody is saying, the action sequences are very well shot and extremely well choreographed, which is great. But to be perfectly honest, I felt some of the action sequences went on for too long, to the point where I stopped caring much about how John Wick can headshot everyone perfectly since he did it so many times in one action scene. I just became kind of like white noise the longer it went on without as much meaning as it had in the first one.

The set pieces were fantastic yet again though to keep the relatively repetitive action sequences a bit more fresh with some different eye candy.

Keanu Reeves' line delivery was truly horrible but his physical acting (stuntwork and ability to portray his pain) was great.

I'm also kind of conflicted on how much more I want this world to be fleshed out because in my mind one of the great things about the first was the world was developed naturally with little to no exposition, (at least in terms of the network of assassins) but also in doing so left some interesting ambiguity as to how it all works. This one developed it quite a bit more which I'm not completely sure how I feel about. Sometimes ambiguity is a good thing, and with a comic coming out, this ending on a cliffhanger for a third, and there's a rumour going around about a TV Show, I feel like that ambiguity will probably be destroyed in favour of a developed extended universe, which could be a good or bad thing.

This is also one of the only times in recent memory where I'm actually genuinely excited by a cliffhanger and thinking about hypotheticals of where it could go next.

diq0loh,"Watched the first and second on the same day, i think its a lot better that way. It helps you pick up on some aspects that i like (but other people may not).

I really love the little quirks to the universe and the running threads. For instance, how the Russian gangster describes john wick (determined, bold, etc) is exactly the same formula he was described as in the first movie.

The thing that makes this a better film (and it could be a lot worse) is the universe for me. There's a whole underground world of assassins. They take payment in some odd, huge gold coins. There's a chain of assassin hotels each with their own roles, rules and economy. 

Similar for the scene about the tubes and the central filing ladies. It almost reminds me of hedwig or times gone by in its almost mystical (mystically useless?) quaint aspect of it. 

I wouldn't say the universe is rich by any stretch. However, it does have its own universe and this makes the film so much better for me. Quite obviously, little things (like people mostly ignoring the violence) also show you its a different universe.

ddlu3mi,"I saw this tonight. Read through some comments, got some input from other movie buff friends of mine. While they haven't seen it yet, they've seen the first one.  
  
The hand-to-hand gun combat is absolutely superb. While no examples come to mind I challenge someone to give a fight scene where both hand to hand and guns were used that did not end logically, especially where guns were fired after hand to hand. This was beautifully done.  
  
The reloads. Logical, timely. The shotgun reload is brought up many times here. Wick checked his ammo numerous times. The infamous 7 ammo scene. Count them once he gets there. Seven. The combined efforts of props and fight choreography is the best in the business.  
  
I also liked the comment about the dog he refuses to name in fear of losing it. Good call. That was definitely an intentional script story beat.  
  
The marker that must be honored. There is no getting out. At least he doesn't have to worry about that anymore.  
  
Common, and I'm not a fan of rappers trying their hand in film since most are not good, was actually quite great. I hope we see him again.  
  
The Continental. This is the catalyst for the next movie. He's on his own now. John Wick vs The World. Not even unplugging from The Matrix can save him now.  
  
History. The word that makes this all work. Hinted, but never expressly said. It's assumed we all know it and that is a beautiful thing. The movie doesn't care if we know it or not, it's about Wick in the moment. This movie doesn't take us for idiots and has assumed we've seen John Wick Prequels 1-3. It's there. All the characters know it. It's a lived-in world. This, above all else, is why I think this franchise has become a cult classic. Weren't you there when Wick was The Ghost? Not going to explain it you, everyone else in the movie knows.  
  
Ruby Rose. Of her 3 features in these last 3 months this should be her biggest hit. We **WILL** see more of her.

ddyjt9w,"I really enjoyed this movie. I've compiled my thoughts [into a video](https://youtu.be/rbsNpnJCUFg), but for those who enjoy text I'll hit some of my major thoughts here.

Goods:

* Action scenes were great, really thought they carried on stylistically from John Wick 1.

* The new lore introduced with the High Table and the markers really adds to the film in my opinion. I also enjoyed the fact that the continental was a global (ish) chain rather than just a New York thing. Expands the universe without making it feel too empty.
* The marker was a good way to get John back in without feeling like a cop out.
* Keanu was pretty great for not having to talk that much.
* Pencil.

Bad:

* Was there a scene with gunshots synced to the music? That was one of my favourite things about the first one but I didn't notice it in this movie. I think I might have just missed it and it actually happened, but does anyone know for sure?",5t4u0w

ddkp3mb,"Great movie, definitely a must see for that liked the first one. As for a 3rd film, wonder what other actors they'll bring in. As long a Jason Statham doesn't come out in, don't think he'll fit in to the world.

ddlsjjt,"Thought it was just okay. The plot in this one was less ""straight forward"" than the first one and I think it suffered. I also think they doubled down on ""John Wick kills 75 people in a room"" action scenes rather than more one on one style combat and by the end it just became boring. He also seemed more ""superhero like"" in this film than the other, in that he seemed invincible. 

I think the story of the first film painted him as a more sympathetic character, I guess? I mean in this one he made a deal with this guy knowing full well what the deal entailed and what the rules were, and is surprised when he has to make due on that promise/oath? The first one he was the clear victim, the guy killed his dog and took his car, whereas this one it's less sympathetic and less relatable (not that my dog was killed by mobsters recently, but you get what I mean...)

So overall I think it was kind of a mixed bag, but the third act fight in the house of mirrors in the museum was breath taking cinematography wise. Great use of locations in this film in general and it's definitely a lot sleeker looking than John Wick 1. ",5t4u0w

On the topic of the movie itself, I thought the it was a little bit too long, although that might have been my post-work fatigue talking.

dds8563,"I love the first John Wick, plot and action. Reddit really sold me on it, had low expectations, and was blown away. Saw Chapter 2 last night, had high expectations, and felt let down. The action had some good moments, but the flow of the action/dialogue seemed to be off for me.  Maybe viewing on blu-ray , I can appreciate it more on a smaller screen or after viewing 1. 

EDIT: Its book-ended by the first and third so it wont be as open and close. Setting up the car rescue seemed to signal to me that the movie is gonna be a true Chapter 2,hence the name. Most ""chapter 2's"" are like this, unsatisfying, open ending, continued from the first, but they upped the stakes, it just feels like every other time waiting for a 3rd movie to come out for a ""planned"" trilogy.

I just gotta say though my favorite part of this movie, was in the Catacombs with the shotty, and hes reloading with his chin and one hand, then draws his pistol with his other. I really want to see that part again. That one handed pistol ammo check was mind boggling.

The ""Please inform authorities if you see anything suspicious"" sound byte during this kind of highlighted how ridiculous the whole scenario was, and it was hilarious. But then, John stabs two people on the subway platform, and a train arrives directly after....and nobody getting off the arriving train reacts to the ripped-apart bodies?

The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, but to me the best part of the movie was these crazy stylized backgrounds with incredibly unorthodox color palettes and weird layouts. Despite taking place in such abstract environments, the action is surprisingly easy to follow, and never lets up on the tension. I loved that the dialogue never revealed to much information all at once: they do a good job at spoon feeding you only small pieces at a time, letting you put the whole picture together in your head. You understand what the relationship between these characters are, with very minimal dialogue. 

This is one of the most asthetically pleasing action movies I've seen in a long time, and that fight vs Cassian (the first one, not the one in the train) is one of, if not my favorite 1 on 1 fight sequence of modern action movies. My only gripe is that they could've varried the action sequences a little, watching John take out dozens of bad guys at a time with his gun fu became a bit redundant after a while. Good on them foe that opening car chase, that shit was amazing.

8.5/10",5t4u0w

ddl0op8," Saw it last night.  

**Stuff I thought was cool:**  

*John having new ""moves"" (e.g. holding a guy against a wall with the barrel of a shotgun, reloading it, and then pulling the trigger).  
   
*A more in depth look at the shadowy underworld of assassins.  

*A deaf/mute main character who is a total badass (though should have been developed more).  
  
*The scene where John talks to Gianna before he has to make sure she's dead.  
 
*The blood oath plot idea was cool (more on this in a second though).  
  
**Things I didn't like:**  
 
*Rehashing the same 'gun-jitsu' moves over and over, gives less weight to a piece of cool choreography when he does it over and over.  
  
*The whole ""blood oath"" conversation was disappointing. What made the first one great was not having every little thing explained to me, expect me to figure it out with minimal dialogue.  
  
*The opening sequence with the chase was fun in a popcorn kind of way but didn't really do much other than establish that this guy is a badass for audience members who missed the first chapter. It was unneeded though because if they stick around for the rest of the movie, they'll get the idea.  
  
*John felt more... prideful in this movie. In the first movie he had a certain level of humility as he interacted with others, even the punk Russian kid. John is a prime example of a person who uses almost exclusivly [laconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconic_phrase) speech. He is a man of principle but not one of pride IMO, this is one of the reasons I disliked the opening sequence, it felt like he was doing it just because he could, no real message behind it other than; ""I'm badder than you"".  

*This one was filled with less powerful emotion. Do you remember in chapter one when John is in the Red Circle and he's stealth killing all those guys while we listen to that song '[Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CurN2Fg-2E)' by Kaleida? There was so much emotion in that scene, John staring into another man's eyes as the the he watches the life drain from him before he moves on like an unspoken ""I know what I am doing, it is necessary, and it matters... more than your life"".  
  
Overall I enjoyed the film. IMO chapter two is just another example how it's very hard to make a squeal to a truly amazing movie, kinda like The Matrix.  

EDITS: I'm bad at reddit formatting. 
",5t4u0w
ddm8gec,"I'm a bit disappointed.

When the first film came around, it was pretty fresh. Well-shot action, lots of tactical gunhandling, headshots, double-taps, judo-moves... In this film, it kept repeating these same actions in its action sequences, to the point I felt fatigued. Once, cool. Twice, cool. Thrice, cool. Even ten times in a row, cool dude. But Jesus Christ I must have seen about dozens of dudes killed the same way, in the same action sequence. I can handle long action sequences with dozens of disposable mooks, but when so many of them are offed the same way... it loses its charm. The film was at its best when it was being creative, with the pencil, or the car action, the mirror sequence, the one-on-one fights... But the gunbattles against dozens of mooks just felt like it was on repeat. Shoot some dudes in the head, move on, judo some dude and double-tap, shoot more guys, judo some dude and shoot others while judoing the guy... Repeat. Yes those things I liked from the original, but at a certain point it's too much. 

We also get to see a lot of the same myth building. We are shown very few new things about this criminal underworld, and we hear a lot of the same quotes and legends about John Wick. We get it, he's badass. Come up with something else to say about the character. 

I like watching guys get shot and judo'd so I liked it overall, it just overdid it.. It was lacking creativity. I've watched Hard Boiled, and that never made me feel action-fatigue and that has a bodycount of 300. Same for the first Wick film. I'm fine if in John Wick 3 they up the ante once again, but please show us more creative killing and plot. Don't just rehash the same thing but more of it. ",5t4u0w
de2772z,"Like most, I saw a kernel of something interesting in the first. Sadly, chapter 2 pushes too far in the wrong direction. John Wick is now a borderline bulletproof superhero, who everyone knows in a world of assassins from every conceivable profession.

Watch the choreography and you can see the bad guys lining up for their headshot, or constantly exposing themselves to a man with legendarily accurate gun skills. Less interested in the next.",5t4u0w

I just have to say I'm really looking forward to the third installment into the franchise, if there is one, but the ending of the movie would lead me to believe so. In addition, John still needs to get his car back once it's been fixed up.

As curious as I am to see where the story goes from here I can't help but wonder what a prequel would be like for the franchise. The actions of John before his retirement are consistently alluded to in the first film and this installment as well. When Santino talks of the major incident that, in which John needed his help resulting in him giving Santino a marker along with Michael Nyqvist describing it as the foundation of the empire he built it just piqued my interest all the much more.

It's the only thing that kinda pulls you away from it. But i give em a pass just cause the scene and the choreography is supreme. They earned it. And it does have more heart and comedy, INTENTIONALLY! than that shit 50 Shades. I'm talking about a scene like Santino orders Wick to kill his sister. I think ""aw man, what a shit guy"".Then we're first introduced to Gianna D'Antonio, (still thinking what a waste to kill a hot lady) and she gives Mr. Akoni that talk about killing kids and taking his properties, immedialty you go ""fuck, she's a shitty cunt too"". Then she sees John and has a talk with him, you see there's also some history there too. So just to show these characters are not as 2D as one might pressume.

For me it was lazy and boring. It had none of the cohesive style of the first movie in my opinion, and I don't mean I want it to be just like the first. It just seemed like a mishmash of JUST gunfighting, just filler choreography, whereas the first one felt fresh every moment of violence.  
  
A lot of the story fell flat to me completely, and personally I'd rate it around 55 not 91. Can someone explain to me what came of the ""1 million dollars a round"" exchange? I was kind of losing focus by that point and it didn't seem to ever lead to anything at all. ",5t4u0w
de37ziy,"I just didn't enjoy it that much and that's coming from someone who bloody loved the first installment. 

The first film felt very stylised which made it unique and something other than just an action film with lots of shooting.

The Russian club scene with the exotic lighting, and stylish music was easily the best scene in the first film, and apart from a glimmer of that at the start of the Catacombs scene with the band playing, it felt like all of that style had gone missing in the second film which was hugely disappointing. 

The second film just feels like overly long shooting scene after overly long shooting scene, shooting endless hordes of guards that consistently just follow each other into Wick's bullets one after the other, and is every person in New York now just suddenly an assassin? 

Just feels like they wasted all of the potential of the first film by attempting to go bigger and more spectacular whilst missing out all of the style from the first.",5t4u0w

ddk77fi,"A pretty good sequel, but an obvious step down from the first one. My main gripe is the villain and John's motivations. In the original he was a monster set loose for vengeance, where as in this one he's like ""well, may as well teach these guys a lesson"". The son in John Wick was the perfect catalyst for his actions. The editing felt a bit worse in this one. The original house invasion and night clubs scenes were chock full of long takes and gruesome drawn out deaths (ex knife to heart in his house). This one seemed to cut and change angles where the original wouldn't have. My last issue was how referential this was to the original, and overly explained some concepts (the marker). John Wick was so loved because it introduced concepts and didn't feel the need to explain them to us. Once the sister died it picked up, but the first portion was disappointing. Still a very fun action film, which would be a solid 85/100 for me.",5t4u0w

Go watch John Wick 2 and pay specific attention to just how much it relies on an unprepared enemy walking into the frame and getting shot instantly.

I would be willing to bet in John Wick 1 & 2 that this occurs at least a hundred times or more.

de92eap,"I'm late to this, so sorry if these are obvious, but two themes jump out at me:

1) Modern man's search for God

2) Addiction

I feel like these are a little obvious in this particular movie, so I'm sorry if I failed to find the right subthreads in here. 

1) As far as theme 1, you could say the same for many characters now: Ip Man, Liam Neeson in Taken, Neo in The Matrix, Luke Skywalker, etc. It's like modern viewers don't want a regular, human protagonist like John McClane from Die Hard; instead they want some inhuman, infallible, flawless hero (even John McClane becomes this in the shitty Die Hard movies of today). These examples I give are still flawed in some ways, but often in ways the echo of Christ-like selflessness (disclaimer, I'm not a religious fella, never been to church). 

2) Addiction is a definite theme of John Wick 2, and it's even mentioned in dialogue how he's addicted to the violence he ""inadvertently"" falls back into. I believe this is a reflection of modern culture which reoccurs in SO many things in entertainment now. This may not even be a consciously attributed theme.

I might just write about this at length on my own. I haven't read any analysis by anyone online. Am I being stupid with this?",5t4u0w

Other than that, John Wick: Chapter Two was an acceptable viewing experience. Peter Serafinowicz need a bit part in every movie.",5t4u0w
ddka7w4,"I enjoyed this movie. It's not bad, but a few small things really kept it being all that I feel it could have been. 

I loved the first film, for the simple, but powerful story, the relatability of the main character, the intensely interesting world we are introduced to, and of course, the masterful action. The reasons for how that story unfolded was clear: ""you killed my dog (the last semblance everything I held dear) and nothing will stop me from getting revenge."" This follow-up was not nearly as clear, and because of that, I felt myself not fully on-board with Wick as the movie progressed. 

Here's the thing for me. I'm all about relatability, and barring the obvious differences between myself and Wick: as an audience member, I gotta be able to root for the hero, or at least be able to relate or sympathize with the key situations that drive him forward. Several things kept clashing for me: he wants out of the killing business, to the point of screaming out in rage to being forced back in, yet he kills almost joyously, taking multiple opportunities to execute the faceless henchmen who stand in his path. Not just kill out of simplicity or disable the threat; he takes the extra time to kill each person he fights.  In the first movie, it wasn't a problem for me, because he seemed to fight with little-to-no passion, choosing simple, calculated moves to stop a threat as efficiently as possible. He was using his horrible gift for his own personal retribution. In this film, he is given a choice, and the consequences of that choice are what result in him taking up the gun again. But the motivating reasons for John to be doing what he's doing never feel as pivotal to me, and on top of that, he seemingly made this choice that causes his grief, instead of being forced back in. Also, for a guy so against his job, which is being apart of a bustling underworld collective of henchmen-for-hire, I  expected him to have a bit more sympathy for the people he kills, especially after all the glimpses we get into the inner workings of this killer culture. He's the best, desperate to stop, and yet he has no problems with mercilessly killing every character that doesn't get a speaking role in the script. These aren't devoted/loyal employees of the guy who killed your dog, these are McDonalds employees of the franchise that screwed up your order. If they made this a character point, like he can't help it or feels some kind of remorse or comraderie it wouldnt be so bad.

Also, I don't mean this to be a cheap shot, but Keanu just did not pull off the dialogue for me. Like, yeah, he's Keanu and thus has a well-documented history of monotone, wooden acting, but this take it to new heights, especially after the heart-breaking impassioned performance from the first film. His lines felt empty and unenthused, like they used practice takes instead of how his lines were meant to come across in the script. On top of that, most of what he says is useless ""Tell whoever comes that I'll kill them"" '... yeah Keanu... we literally have whole sections within this movie where other characters talk at length about your impressive history of killing people... I'm certain that will happen again'.

Look, I get that this is nitpicking a bit. This is, in spirit, a dumb action movie. But where  the first film took that notion and turned it on its head to make a damn intelligent film, with more heart and soul than most other films can come close to, this one knowingly embraces the cliches the first film shunned. That's why it means so much to me that they missed the mark on this one. Where the first film used fantastic action set-pieces to serve the narrative, I feel this film uses the narrative to serve the action scenes. Ultimately, as amazing as the action was, it all felt a bit hollow and meritless when compared to the integrity and emotional weight that drove the incredible action in the first film. 

TL;DR: I liked it. Not bad, but not good either. Super cool, but a bit soulless when compared to the first.",5t4u0w
ddn0ejn,"The good:

The marker was an excellent addition to the universe.  It provided a very believable reason for there to even be a John Wick 2.

The characters and general world building were excellent as well.

The bad:

The catacombs fight went on too long. In general the fights were too long, feeling like they were trying to go for ""more"" but this one in particular stuck out.  It was wave after wave of dudes coming down the tunnel and getting shot, with no real stakes.  Have most of the battle be out in the light show, or have him spend most of the time without a gun.  Then he gets his shotgun and fucks shit up in order to escape.

The ending.  The whole purpose of going after Santino was that John wanted to punish someone for dragging him back in.  By killing him in that manner, John made sure he was dragged back in.  It also sets up the 3rd movie to have to be ""more more more"" with everyone and everything against John, rather than a tight and smart action movie.  Finally it goes completely against his character.  I could see him not caring about the rules in order to save Hellen (if she were still alive), but this?

Overall a solid movie, especially considering what a hard act it had to follow.  It makes me want to go back and watch the first one more than anything though.",5t4u0w

Oh, and what the hell was up with John refusing the contract and not expecting retaliation? Even Ian McShane was like ""wtf m8?"" Made him come across as not too smart. 

Oh, and that damn body armor woven into his suit? Dude must have gotten shot like 30 times and only emerged with bruises. Takes away most of the tension if he can shrug off bullets now.

Oh yeah, and now that we know that half of New York is comprised of assassins, it feels like less of a criminal underworld and more like an alternate universe where assassins are as saturated as fast food workers.

ddkebay,"Should have been better. Don't get me wrong, it was quite good (a few of the scenes, especially the coliseum concert shoot out, a bathtub execution, and a fun one with a pencil were EXCELLENT) but it should have been better. 

First, way too much previous film retread. John wants out, someone pulls him back in. Continental Rules. Zzz. Give us something new. Give us a different side of John Wick we didn't see before. 

Second, the movie was at its best when it made this realization - John *likes* being the Boogeyman. And the longer his wife is dead, the more fun he is when he indulges in that part of himself and loses sight of the man he wants to be. That's a nice internal conflict to keep things interesting without getting too deep. 

Third, John needs friends. Common and Ruby Rose were a good start, but the character work overall was a bit week after Defoe and some of the fun side characters from the last film. Give us more than that. 

Fourth, is everyone in fucking New York a Continental assassin? Why are all of them getting texts about John Wicks bounty? Am I an assassin? Should I be trying and failing miserably to kill him?  

Fifth, the ending was a step in the right direction. Cutting him off from his resources, putting a bigger target with more powerful people on his head. Part 3 should be lit. They should have saved Fishbourne and his weird little hobo army for that one. ",5t4u0w

I can see how its a real cool part of Wick's character, but when that shtick has nothing different to play off of it gets a little dull.

ddnq9jk,"I thought the open account on John Wick with all the assassins in New York gunning for him was one of the worst parts of the movie because we knew he wasn't going to die and it was just a matter of waiting to get the head shots over with. The action was fast-paced enough to overlook the scope of realism for the most part, but the slower paced scenes, such as the subway scenes with Common, made it hard to believe they can have a gunfight in the streets of NYC with bodies everywhere without any type of law enforcement intervention. Maybe a better way to portray that sequence was to *not* show who the assassins (such as the sumo-looking guy, violin girl, Russian cleaning crew, etc.) were before John Wick was in NYC and have the scene from his perspective where everyone he comes across could be a threat.

",5t4u0w
ddlnbxc,"I did not like this movie as much as the first one. I appreciated the action scenes for the most part. The mirror scene was very cool, and I thought the first fight with Cassian (Common) was extremely well done. I also liked that the deaf woman wasn't really able to match Wick in a hand-to-hand fight. Giving up 50 pounds to anyone that has the same level of training as you is generally going to go poorly. I even enjoyed the most of the dialogue in the movie. Thought pretty much everyone played their part well. The problem is that the things I didn't like were bugging me for most the movie. It essentially boils down to two things. 1. If he got in to kill the original mark undetected, why the fuck would you leave through the front door?! I suppose this could lend credence to what Santino says about John loving killing people, or whatever it was, but it still seemed like the stupidest decision ever. 2. The bad guys were almost as bad as storm troopers or James Bond henchman. The aim is comically bad at times. They don't wear any body armor for some reason. Seemingly 0 tactical awareness. I never really felt like John was in much danger. These are supposed to be badasses working for this major Italian crime organization. I can buy it more when it looked like a sketchy Russian operation, but even those guys seemed better trained.

My two cents. Give it a 7/10. Good, but not as good as the original. ",5t4u0w

ddn1ihu,"I really enjoyed this movie, but I can't help but feel like the movie would have ended better if John just died. There's only so much you can do with a character who's literally an unkillable hitm
an, amd throwing more bodies at him for another 2 hours in Chapter 3 seems so redundant. I think it would have been better that he realized how his whole life was pointless without Helen because his past would always catch up to him, so he kills D'Antonio on purpose. He would then grieve for the final time in the ruins of his former home amd await Continental Assassins to end his suffering.

1. If John is made to kill Gianna due to the medallion - how can it be held against him that he had to do it? Even if she was Cassian's ward?

To learn about everyone from the big boss, the high table, the assassins, the arms dealers, tailors, mechanics, contract secretaries.

What's the conversion rate from USD to gold coins? Just how many assassins are there? What kind of people outside of the organization do they kill? Can anyone in or out of the organization open a contract? Could you theoretically stay at a hotel forever if you're being hunted by someone other than John Wick?

I know it's probably better left a mystery but I like lore and world building.

The highlight of the movie for me is probably the hand-to-hand combat. The gunfights, while still very well choreographed, I find the style to be a bit repetitive. I still rewatch the club scene from the first movie once in a while, and the first shootout in the sequel is awesome, but after that, I feel like watching the same scene over and over again, just with a different background. Plus it's pretty annoying when a lot of times they don't actually show the kills, which is the most satisfying part, just closeup shots of Wick pointing and shooting at a general direction. 

I loved the world building of the underground assassins organization in the first movie and hoped they will show more in the second one, and they did, however, again, a little too much. The Continental hotel is pretty interesting and unique, but once you have all these tailor, gun smiths, etc., it becomes really cheesy and generic. I guess those characters make sense for an assassin organization, probably just they way the movie present it. 

While I admire Keanu Reeves' dedication to this role, his lines delivery is so painful to watch. Every time he says something it's like he's trying to remember the dialogues, especially when he speaks foreign languages, really unnatural. Despite having very few words, I still feel like the character talks too much. 

The movie is still quite enjoyable, but I think I will enjoy it more when I look up the action scenes on YouTube from time to time a few months from now.    ",5t4u0w

When he was fighting Cassian in the cabin and none of the passengers whipped out their phone and started recording. 
Or that during the entire period of shooting and killing and general mayhem the local law enforcement never arrived, not once. 
The man has superhuman aim and I am okay with that, but everyone who fires at him suddenly becomes a stormtrooper.

While the action of the movie was above par, the sequences where the characters talked did not do it for me. I really loved the bit in which he goes back home after everything is done and combs through the wreckage of his home to find the memorabilia of his wife. 
Which leads me to my last issue with the movie, the wife did not really do it for me, I did not connect with Wick about the loss of his Wife.

ddpf2qx,"I loved John Wick and forced all my friends to watch it.  We all went together to see John Wick 2.  I did not like this one as much.
1. It was more graphic.  I couldn't watch the kills anymore with all goop flying out.
2.  It seemed like there was a lot of gratuitous killing.  In the first movie, the kills were necessary as JW was trying to reach the bratty kid or stop the guys trying to kill him.  I guess the killing was necessary in John Wick 2 to stop them from killing him, but it just seemed far too much.
3.  Where was the beautiful martial arts, cool gun fu stuff?  The first movie had gun fu/martial arts that looked like a deadly ballet.  I was disappointed at JW2 for not having any or more of it.
4. I wasn't invested emotionally. No revenge driving JW this time.  Except after you know who did you know what.  But still, nothing like your puppy getting killed!",5t4u0w
de2nbll,"Hated it.
I felt it went out of its way to undermine the great world building the first one had done, just to get him shooting people again.
I mean the token is part of the continental rules it would seem. To refuse it implied the Santino could have killed him on the spot. Let alone Winston.
So I felt the house explosion as his main motivation for revenge just felt weak. Guys killing your dog and flogging your car a few days after losing your wife is understandable.  He was ""back"". Santino could have easily turned up while the wife was still alive and demand payback, but he gave him respect and space, waited till he heard the boogeyman was working again and jumped on it. It didn't even seem like the concrete was dry for his re-retirement.
To refuse the token straight up took the teeth out of the continental like 15mins in. Then Winston even takes wicks side with ""oh you shouldn't have blown his house up"" then proceeded to just let him walk for some reason. As if to prove they could have finished him there gets everyone to flash mob after breaking the cardinal rule that stops an actual revenge gunfight in the same movie. But even that seemed forced. She essentially killed herself so he shoots her corpse just to get another few blood dummys. The first scene was a joke. The only way it made sense was if he only cared about the photo. Could have easily cleared the warehouse without destroying the car. 
I just felt they missed the point of what made the first one great. I loved that one by the way.",5t4u0w

Wick kills a lot of minions (naturally).  There's some witty allusions when he visits the Sommelier. But not really a lot of story to this one.

Unless you're a superfan, don't pay full price - see it as a matinee.

Prediction for the inevitable next film:  
1. Keanu retires from the role, and it gets picked up by someone who has been on the fringe of the action genre.  
2. Wick hides out in a small town, becoming accepted by the locals, until someone lets the High Table know his location.  Chaos ensues when they arrive.

ddqhfd5,"I love this movie series, it's in my top 5 but it's also hard to recommend. Let me explain a bit.

Watching the movie I see where different cuts would work or they were a bit timid on doing something a bit creative. Let's look at the first film, where he has the get together after the funeral and he is looking out the window. This was a fantastic point to have a creative shot, perhaps John standing at the window with a time lapse of everyone behind him. Showing motion (dragging the shutter to ""blur"" people walking) as this would add to his feeling of being separated and alone.

I have seen many missed opportunities in these movies. Do I recommend them, yes but not by saying they are amazing, which they are in a way. This series has a unique feel and the world is the key to it. This world welcomes you in but only just, and only with small amounts of information. It's incredibly intriguing. I have to say that coupled with Keanu's abilities to handle a weapon make a perfect storm.

So it's in my top 5, but it's a recommend that I give with some caveats. Most people will love the movie, as do I, but I see what it could actually be. Not disappointed, just want them to do more creative things with the shots and the series overall—it's good perhaps great but it could be incredible.",5t4u0w
ddv619q,"The first scene of the film was a projection of a Buster Keaton film. We know where the makers come from. I loved that.

I liked the fact that the Mustang chase sequence did not have flares.

I however didn't feel as emotionally invested in Jone Wick being depressed with his wife's death. It was a little overdone. The first movie was spot on with that sentiment.

Well we get the point, dont fuck with wick.

The texts on screen for certain dialogs were loud. Could have done those much better. They had to go with the graphic novel kinda thing i guess.

My most favorite scene was when Wick goes through those glass doors into the lift after the fight scene at the Art installation. The juxtaposition of the commentary with film was neat. (So was it in the metro station)

The scene where the bald dude and John trade silenced bullets from across floors was downright eye ball rolling silly.

I want to see John miss shots man, why does he have a cheat code on! :O

By the end of the film i was tired with replay after replay of John getting beaten to pulp, and then he rises and then shoots the brains off people, and its mostly in the middle of a party.

It was great, some of the best hand to hand combat ive seen, the bald dude and Wick in Rome outside the continental was nothing short of awesome. But the emotions were all over the place.",5t4u0w

Serious top marks to the cinematography outside of the action scenes. I also really enjoyed some of the smaller moments, like reloading a shotgun while pinning an enemy down with the barrel.

ddwoogo,"I felt this movie was disgustingly sexist, misogynistic and racist. First off why does the star have to be a white male? We have hundreds of action movies starring white males already. Why can't we have had Ruby Rose as Joanna Wick instead? I think she would have killed that role more so than Keanu. They could have also threw support to the LGBT community if the main character was lesbian. But that complaint is more of for the first movie too.  

Moving on the female characters were pretty much used to demonize and degrade women. Even in the first movie seems like they portray women as selfish and evil. Then they brutally kill off all the women characters. Gianna Santino ""submits"" to John Wick and kills herself. Also the very fact that they killed off the only woman that had any semblance of power just so his brother could have her power further supports our patriarchal society. 

Next why are the receptionists of the hotel people of color? Also why did they have to insert that line about the land of that african man being stolen? The ""beggar"" lord just had to be black too right? While the ""high table"" is comprised of white males in fancy suits. 

If Hollywood wants their stereotypical sexist and racist action movies then fine but at the very least include trigger warnings before the movie. This film had so much misogynistic and racist undertones.   

Only bright side is this film shows off Ruby Rose as a potential action megastar if Hollywood lets her. Would LOVE to see her as the next 007 and having ""Bond boys"" draped on her arms. ",5t4u0w

Actually, they can be. You just have to use a reasonable weapon for it. Something like a .22 or even a 9mm is fairly easy, while completely silencing a .45 is pretty damn hard.

ddnk9d2,"Bourne funny enough did it in the first film. After that they deviated from the books and killed the girl and never replaced her. 

Transporter did it in the first and that never sat well with me. I felt the actress didn't sell it well.

Transporter 2 didn't have it directly but it had the unfaithful wife which never sat well with me but I liked it better then the second.

Transporter 3.......YMMV on the looks of the girl but she looked like a child compared to Statham and that was awkward... Would have been fine if they just nixed that romance and had the banter.

Bond really needs to move away from this. One night stands, okay I get. The man is a drunk assassin. But Skyfall did pretty well until they forced in that one screw but luckily they removed her and got the real plot underway. QOS I know some folks don't like but again while I hated they threw in a girl for Bond to sleep with I did like how the Bond girl didn't sleep with him and just kissed him on the forehead. Seeing a much older man with girls who look like they could be his daughter was getting distracting. Then Spectre really dropped the ball. The first one made no sense and the second made no sense and honestly looks like his daughter. Dear lord Bond can sleep with women his age or older. But I guess it's that sex = strong bond worth killing for. 

Didn't see the 2nd Hitman movie but the first one sorta got around that. They never get together and you can see it as more professional protector and charge.


So it's likely Logan won't pull romance in this film which I like. The Wolverine romance once again never sat well with me. Too damn forced and old(ignoring even Wolverines age, Jackman is not a young man).

de6fxk9,"In the 1st movie, someone tried to kill John in the hotel. So, the 2nd movie isn't exactly breaking from tradition...

Also John's action makes sense. Look at it this way:

1. Santino is richer than John and can afford to stay in the hotel longer. John will have to stay in the hotel too as he will be perpetually hunted outside of the hotel.

2. While John waits for Santino to leave the hotel, Santino gets time to take over NY and gather an army of assassins to protect him. 

So, if John chose to follow the rules, Santino would leave the hotel when John's destitute, surrounded by an army, which means John has no chance to kill him. ",5t4u0w
de6lyoy,"I get what you're saying, but I think that's the whole point of the ending. Hate seeing Winston turn into an antagonist as well, I love him. But I think that'll make the third film even more exciting as John and Winston are pitted against each other, each with so much respect for the other.

I liked the ending, how John accepted the rules of the Continental in every other circumstance (like when he and Common broke through the window) but as if he weighed up the options and considered what Santino has done and considered it the best way to exact his revenge as /u/worlds_best_nothing pointed out below",5t4u0w
deiqhbp,"I like that he killed Santino there. John knew what the repercussions were and just wanted the guy dead that bad. Totally understandable. The guy stabbed him in the back and ran for a safe space. The right choice, maybe not, but completely understandable. Think about it, what did John have left? Just his vengeance. Santino was right on that. 

Not that it was his intention but I guess it also sends a message that those who come after him, will have nowhere safe to hide.

dee371n,"I actually loved that scene so much. 
It was silent, and you know, it's the Continental. It has a theme of silence, rules, honor, whatnot.  
It truly showed how much will it took for John, the 'by-the-book' guy, to break the rules.  


He kept through to a promise, even though he had to assasinate a seat of the tavle. 
He crashed through the window of Continental at one point, and stopped fighting immediately when brought to the attention of it.  


He could've either waited for the smug bastard, who comes from a very rich and influental high position (By that point, he was one of the assassin chairmen or whatever) to run out of money, avoid getting himself killed, and then kill him.  
Or, he could've exacted his revenge right there and then, finish the life of the man who took his peace.  


Poor John. He only wanted to be at peace, left alone.

deavypl,I wanted the dog to do it,5t4u0w
dhr6o4r,"I personally though something like this was going to/could have happened;
John returns to the Hotel and re-unites with his dog - goes upstairs to the restaurant and has a similar confrontation and conversation with Santino - Winston warns him against doing anything and reminds him of the rules - John lowers his gun and visibly calms down - then he very casually says ""Get him boy"" or something along those lines and his dog leaps at Santino, knocking him over backwards in his chair and ripping his throat out - everyone looks shocked and Winston doesnt know what to say - technically John didnt kill Santino 

But I dont know it could also be argued John gave the order and essentially did kill Santino but John Wick (the movies) seem to be pretty loose with how things like this are reacted to interpreted. I would picture Winston acting initially shocked and then smirking and maybe quipping that ""I suppose it wasn't you who was conducting business...""

I turned to my brother and called this in the movie but I certainly didn't see John straight capping him as an eventuality and wasn't too disappointed with it. Kind of annoying rash decisions like this are why John had his house blown up and is now on the run (for the third movie) but whatever I dont care I just want more John Wick.
John Wick Chapter 2 was fucking rad and I potentially preferred it to the first. The easter eggish thing of Keanu using the three guns he used in his 3 gun course training was pretty cool, but in hindsight he was probably training for John Wick 2 in that video...",5t4u0w

di24xcb,"This is frankly a problem I've noticed in most action films where the protagonist isn't immune to bullets. I mean I can understand why they do it. On one hand, in terms of tone and intensity it doesn't slow down the action scene and become awkward. But on the other hand it's something I've noticed before and can't really unsee. 

>I guess if all the goons are shooting John far away outside the camera fame tactically, it could be as bored as dead.

Yeah, it's harder to film that and you'll notice that goons running towards John all run into frame and they just pick up the action from there. It's also for practical reasons in terms of story. It'll be significantly harder for John to live through the sheer number of enemies he faced if some of them didn't give him a chance to disarm them and they all shot at him from afar. They'd have to realistically tone down the amount of enemies he chews through and that would honestly be a bit boring with shorter action sequences since they are all just shooting each other from range. The melee fights grappling/disarming were some of the coolest parts of the action.

It even happens in other franchises. I've noticed it in Winter Soldier and The Nolan Batman series (that trilogy was especially terrible about it, much worse than what you see here in John Wick) recently. I'm sure there are more, especially if the protagonist is one where they use melee combat but goons are using guns.

You'll notice once there no danger from being shot to death from a far it doesn't happen. The warehouse scene from BvS was able to eliminate this because they just made his suit bulletproof, so mooks actually shot from a far. But I guess in other cases you'll have to suspense disbelief and assume the mooks are just inexperienced and want to move closer for a better shot or w/e.

While we've seen a small window into the future in seeing what life is like with a bounty on his head, now he has double the bounty *and* no resources *and* nowhere to hide, *and* with the cut to John Leguizamo, it's implied no one in their right mind can help him or risk getting themself killed. There's a greater sense of dread of what's to come. Ending it where you suggested would've left a lot of questions unanswered, and knowing the rules of the Continental we would have a general idea that he is, in fact, fucked, but the importance of the end scenes wasn't just him running through Central Park, but every fucking head in Central Goddamn Park turning to look at him as he goes.

As for the one hour thing, I believe it was a bit of a courtesy to friend. It's rather apparent in both films that certain characters have a strong respect for John, some of which seem to consider him a friend. The hour was likely a sort of grace period for John to get away, or get ready, before Winston had to excommunicate John, and therefore send other assassins to kill him.

Another thing that goes on this list for me was the shooting in crowds. In JW1 there was a single scene where John was shooting people on the dance floor of the club, people who should be counted as innocent civilians (I'm not counting the people in the pool level because they seemed to be more of an inner crowd). There, he shot neatly and at an downward angle, minimizing the possibility of hitting someone innocent. In JW2 there's a bunch of shooting among the concertgoers, which I thought was pushing the line. Later on, in the subway, that line was definitely crossed for me because they were so far away, yet still trying to shoot each other. Why were they so sure they wouldn't hit someone innocent? The fact that nobody even noticed the shots was just ridiculously dumb, as you say.

John refuses the marker because he is no longer THAT guy anymore that made that promise to Santino. So Santino blows up his house with all the memories of his wife. Before he blows up his house, John looks at a picture of his wife. So that was one reason why John already wanted to kill him. Santino was angry about the fact that his father gave his seat at the high table to his sister, Gianna. So Santino wanted his sister dead so he could take her place at the table. He asked John to kill his sister so the high table doesn't know Santino was the one who ordered the killing on his sister. The high table would think that John killed her. That's why Santino put a 7 million dollar bounty on his head to make it believable that John killed Gianna. So he calls John when he is at the continental in Rome and says: what kind of brother would I be if I don't avenge my sister? After John already completed the marker. That's why John hung up the phone when he said that. He knew in that moment Santino double-crossed him. As I understand the High Table still doesn't know that Santino killed or ordered the killing on Gianna, because Santino made them believe that John killed her. What they do know is that John shot Santino in the head on continental grounds. So it is 7 million for Gianna who was a member of the high table before Santino ordered the killing. And now that John killed Santino who was the replacement of gianna at the high table, they put an extra 7 million dollar bounty for Santino on top of the 7 million for Gianna. So that makes 14 million. That's why I think the Marker that Winston gave him at the end is the marker of the blood oath between John and Santino.

ddmpl9y,"> Why did Santino ever bother involving John Wick to begin with?

Because he had the mark. Presumably no one else would be willing to go after a High Table member, regardless of the price, because it means you're a target in perpetuity. Even setting aside the difficulty of escaping the initial aftermath of the assassination with your life. With the mark, he had a way to ""force"" a skilled enough hitman to do his dirty work.

The only part that didn't sit well with me is the arbitrary ""I need to clean up loose ends"", but I guess he only wanted to do that so John couldn't leak word that Santino was the reason Wick killed his sister. But it seems like any member of his organization would've been able to be a leak and I doubt every single one of his dozens of men had 100% loyalty. People would know regardless that Santino met Wick shortly before his sister's death, and people would put two and two together. Winston of course knew and he's a rather powerful figure, and even that didn't seem to stop Santino's ascension to the High Table. So either the High Table members have a terrible intelligence network or just didn't care.",5t4u0w
ddmp822,"That's exact the problem.
Where can you find a assassin thinking himself could escape after the assassination of a Mafia Princess? From Cassian? 
The escape is always the harder part in a assassination.
After all, assassins are not suicide bombers, they take a mission with the confidence to at least survive. 

You have to find the best assassin even dares to take the mission (and really has the odds to success, not just takes the case out of pure stupidity or greed) 
Then you have to kill him if you don't want the secret of where the hit order comes from to be ever revealed. 
Ordering a hit on one's own sibling for power is not the most brilliant thing to be known for even by mafia standards.

The best part is...the film didn't even try or slightly want to explain all theses silly politics and mechanics. 
But it's just there. ",5t4u0w
ddmtsyl,"> Why did Santino ever bother involving John Wick to begin with?

Like I see Stormare (as an actor) is as notable as Leguizamo, McShane, so I don't see him just being a cameo.

It was really straight forward without outright telling you through exposition, dude.

He thought Ares would kill him but she fucked up by telling him that she was going to kill him (ironic because she doesn't ""speak"") thinking that his assassins were better, and then again he thought he would buy himself enough time to get Wick killed by retaining the marker thinking that his political position would earn his favor over Wicks legacy not knowing that Winston would demand it back immediately and not take no for an answer, and finally when he makes it to The Continental thinking Wick won't break the rules.

de0dix2,"I agree that the fight scenes were over all repetitive, but I disagree on some of the details. First, I thought that the seven bullets thing worked fine because it created a bit of variety by forcing John to steal other guns and come up with other takedowns whenever he ran out of ammo. The museum fight was the second really long (in my opinion a bit too long) fight against an endless stream of nameless henchmen I'm the movie, so the choreographers were clearly trying to mix it up a bit. You could certainly argue that the one gun/seven bullets setup was a bit misleading since the scene did end up as a gunfight, but I can definitely see what the directors were going for. Likewise, the pencil scene, the shotgun scene, and the silenced pistols in a busy subway scene were all very clearly attempts to add some variety to the fight choreography and in my opinion they all worked, but they were padded out to such an extent with generic close quarters pistol fights that the movie as a whole still got repetitive.

Over all, the two things that people like about John wick are the fight scenes and the world building. For my tastes, I think about 10 to 15 minutes could have been shaved off the longer fight scenes and dedicated instead to world building. That would have condensed the creative fight choreography while stripping out the repetitive parts and instead developing more of the badass assassin underground.

I feel that the first John Wick was jam packed with creativity and passion but strapped for budget. The second one felt more like they the production staff got a little too excited about having more money to play with and in places they went for ""more"" without realizing that it may not be ""better"".

The choice of guns. John is no typical action hero, not often using BFG's and explosives--he only uses it when necessary. We finally get to see him use a shotgun, but he uses a one-handed firearm for the majority. A man with preferred tools.

The lack of overt violence. No blown heads, no bucketfulls of spilled blood, no gory deaths. Like a true assassin, John works quick and clean. Even when he was using a shotgun, the setpiece lighting was pretty dark; we get shielded from much of the blood and gore.

And lastly, John's knowledge of vital body parts. We never got to see this in the first movie, but here he uses it as a bargaining chip.

Gotta say, the detail on this is pretty awesome.

He ended his grudges, lost the right to stay at the Continental, and now he just has to get through the first hundred idiots that come after him.

Then again, maybe he just didnt care and let his emotions overtake him. The repercussions at that time did not matter to him. Santonio did say he thinks Wick is addicted to that feeling of vengeance and the danger again.",5t4u0w
ddn7j8t,"Well, really anything Wick does is acting impulsively with no regard of the consequences. After his car was stolen and dog was killed in the first movie he could've simply not chased them down and stayed in retirement, but like it was personal and emotional. Maybe not his car so much as killing the dog, because the dog had value as the final gift from his wife and something to care for in his grieving. The reason everyone freaked out was because they knew John Wick would do what he needed to do **no matter what**.   
Santino destroyed his last other memory of his wife, his home. Everything of hers was there and all of their memories, photos, videos burned up. As Laurence Fishburne put it, he destroyed his temple.   
So now John has his own *mark* on Santino, and again will do everything he can to finish it. He was still going to have a bounty on his head, Santino even said things would only be worse if he killed him. Paying the price of having his membership evoked was cheap for him, especially when all he wanted was to be out of that life.   
Although yes, it would make for a good rule to have someone who put a bounty on someone be exempt from the no killing rule, at least from that person. It would reduce infighting and make bounties cost more than just cash. But no violence is no violence, for there being so few rules an exemption would be odd ",5t4u0w

John Wick is John Wick but he can't survive for long in public with that contract out. He also can't wait in the Continental as long as Santino can, due to money and influence, even if he wanted to. Basically his options were to die and have Santino live, or to kill Santino and have them both die.

ddobif3,">  (why did he do that? was he really just doing his brotherly duty as he said?)

Ares (Santino's enforcer) calls John a ""loose end,"" so it's likely that he just didn't want anyone to find out that he was the one who put the hit on his sister. It could have had negative consequences for him later if other seats at the table found out.

> I also think the Continental should have a rule against putting out a hit on someone then taking safe harbor inside, that was such a pussy move and the contract should be void.

Something like this wouldn't void the contract, but it would definitely ruin the reputation of whoever was doing it. Santino basically knew he had no other choices if he wanted to live, so he took the coward's way out. If he had survived, doing this would definitely hurt his standing.

Otherwise, I think the main reason John killed Santino, and in the Continental no less, was because Santino basically made it impossible for him to go back to his normal life. Maybe it wasn't a rational decision, but if he let Santino live he still would have had a bounty on his head. At that point it was probably more about ending Santino's hold on him than actually getting himself out of trouble.",5t4u0w
ddn72o3,"Hello. 

Family is a big deal in southern European culture. I believe that played a great deal in making Santino wanting to get rid of his sister's murderer, which ironically was actually Santino himself. It was a way for his crooked mind to justify his twisted deed. However, I do believe that another factor came into play here as well, which was cutting all loose ends, like it was mentioned in the movie. By getting rid of Wick, he would be getting rid of the person outside his organisation who knew who had called for the assassination. (And who Santino probably suspected could harm him after having paid the blood debt. He did wreck Wick's house after all.)

I was also not expecting Wick to shoot Santino in the Continental either. But that scene was satisfying as shit, haha. Anyways, I realised that the reason I was not expecting it is because I thought that it meant his death sentence. That was not the case. He was simply excommunicated. (The hit on his head was from the Italian family, not Winston) So Wick broke the rules, now he's not allowed with the cool guys anymore, which I think was the price he was willing to pay.

It's a theme with these movies. I just rewatched the first. For the most part, civilians do not give a shit if someone dies or gets shot, and they do not make a fuss. You have to remember that The John Wick movies are set in a specific world. It is not a normal one.

No. He lacked the resources as a lone wolf to find a man while he is being hunted by assassins. He was getting his ass handed to him between the blonde, the sumo, the asian duo, common and the eastern european duo were on his tail before he paid for help. He needed to get patched up as well.

What really niggles away at me is that Keanu (despite giving it his all and then some) doesn't really have an air of menace about him. He's brooding - and a bit on the dark side - but I never feel that he's a remorseless menace, or a legitimate force of intimidation. Luckily I almost begin to change my mind when he starts bashing, smashing, and grinding people into well-deserved mincemeat ;)

What Keanu does have going for him is an aura of zen detachment, almost as if he's perpetually tuned in to a higher frequency. It gives the guy a peculiar air of intrigue which I don't feel the director's been clever enough to take advantage of. ",5t4u0w

Once he is finished, he can then turn in the Marker to Winston and say ""I want back on the Protected list/I want to be reCommunicated/un-Excommunicated"", which Winston has to fulfill as, by his own explanation, you just have to do whatever they ask you to do if they use a Marker.

ddrsf29,"I think it's a pretty straight forward conclusion. 

The Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne's character) had a similar altercation with John years ago. He was stabbed in the neck and was given a choice. He could've shot John in the back or keep pressure on the wound. And what was shown in the movie is that he chose to put pressure on his neckwound and survived.

With Cassian (Common's character) he had the same altercation only this time he stabbed him in the aorta and was also given a choice. If he removed the blade from the aorta he would bleed to death. As they show you in the movie Cassian left the blade in his aorta and laughs when John says: consider it a professional courtesy. He could've easily shot him in the head after to make sure he's dead. So that's been left open for chapter 3.

With Ares (Ruby Rose's character) he first stabbed her in the hand and pushed it into her heart. He didn't gave her the same choice as Cassian and The Bowery King and pulled the blade straight out. In other words: she bleeds out pretty quickly and dies. That's why John's reaction was ""sure"" when she said i'll be seeing you soon. She was not given the same professional courtesy as was given to Cassian or The Bowery King.

This is my point of view on this situation. I hope this answers your question. ",5t4u0w

I thought that this cut 2 ways:  
  
1 - we see that John is a professional. He has a method, it works, he has perfected it, he uses it. It's through practice and repetition that he has mastered his skills, so it makes sense that he uses similar technique (grapple 1 guy melee, shoot a guy at distance, headshot grapple guy) all the time.  
  
2 - it is really fucking boring for the audience to see the same tricks over and over again. In my opinion, no action sequence in 2 compares to the nightclub in 1. 1 was great because of how surprising it was to see how good Wick was. Now that we already know how good he is, it feels awfully routine, mystery is gone, and it's a bit boring.

From a throwback/homage to the first movie as well as understanding Wick (as a character) better, than you'll be lost a little. The first 10 minutes of the movie is a homage to the first movie.

For one, John has zero access to this intriguing Underground Society that the franchise has been building on, bit by bit.

On the other hand, I loved some of the throwbacks. I loved seeing Aurelio again, and that pencil scene was bad ass.

They deepened the Continental lore and we have a better grasp of the criminal hierarchy now but there is still a certain sense of mystery.

John not having any friends gave everything more danger. He was on his own, completely, and even more so after the end of the film. Its just him and The Dog With No Name.

I would have preferred more variation in action choreography and gladly traded the first 30 minutes of plot construction for one more action sequence.  At a little over 2 hours, John Wick 2 is not a short movie but it seemed on the short side because it took so long to really get moving.  The two main villains played by Ruby Rose and Riccardo Scamarcio were outshone by the supporting villain played by Common, and their screen presence paled in comparison to that of Adrianne Palicki's Perkins and Michael Nyqvist's Viggo from #1.  Fortunately as with #1 the sequel benefits greatly from the performances and cameos of supporting cast members such as John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Willem Dafoe (#1) and Laurence Fishburne (#2).",5t4u0w

So it's either A) Honor the rules, stay in the Continental as long as he can afford and prolong the inevitable death upon leaving; or B) Eliminate Santino, cancel the contract, and deal with the consequences.  
  
John is a pragmatist.  B is the only route that, at least, leads to Santino's death.

ddlgcmz,"A plot hole is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot.
None of your questions are plot holes, but I'll answer the best I can.

1. Probably, maybe, I don't know, it's a fictional universe with its own rules like the MCU, DCU, Transformers Franchise, and the Fast and Furious franchise.

1. If you saw a two dudes going at it with knives and guns would you want to intervene? They may be assassins or maybe they just want to stay out of it like most people do. Lots of illogical things happen in action films that don't make sense and is best to just ignore it since it's a minor detail.

1. What are you talking about? If you are talking about the guns he had back at the house before it got blown up. Maybe they weren't the kind he needed, didn't want to go through the hassle of going through the rubble, or didn't want to attract attention while taking it through airport security?

1. He did it because his henchmen failed to kill him and knew John would come back and seek vengeance for going back on their deal. Also, the guy is a complete asshole that wanted to kill his own flesh and blood for power there's really no need to explain more about why does what he does.

1. It doesn't work that way because John made a deal with him using the marker which is a blood oath that is part of the rules and ethics created by the High Table. His sister understood that because she grew up being groomed to take the seat at the High Table so instead of dying by the rules of the High Table, she chose to die her way. This was all explained in the film. It's like how the Continental doesn't allow killing in the hotel. ",5t4u0w
ddlbnsi,"I can at least answer a couple.

Santino sent the other men out basically to clean up. [He actually answers your question saying something along the lines of 'Sorry John, but what kind of a brother would I be if I didn't avenge my sister?'](#spoiler)

As far the sister goes, [John wasn't doing it for money. He was basically indebted to Santino and that was how he was going to clear the marker. Santino's wish was John would kill his sister so he could take a seat at the High Table, and in order to fulfill his end of the contract, John had no choice but to kill Gianna or his life would be forfeit based on the rules set forth by the council.](#spoiler)

Edit: Changed the quote around",5t4u0w
ddlbxid,"1. This has always been a thing since the first movie but it was more of a subtext than actual text. Jimmy for example is a police officer who knows John's profession which basically tells us this criminal underworld is literally everywhere and everything but now this proves it. No one is clean.

2. Not assassins otherwise theyd hunt John, but they probably are vaguely aware of the underworld and figured to stay out of their way. Otherwise fair point, it IS a bit of a stretch.

3. Probably because his guns arent clean and buying guns from the underworld is a good form of book keeping to keep crimes against the Continental accountable. Way of managing business and a way for them to identify who shot who and so on in case they need to hunt an excommunicated merc, i.e Perkins. 

4. Because he knew John might come for him after blowing up his house. Also Winston forced him to acknoweldgd the pact was fulfilled in an official capacity. He probably wanted to make sure John could not retaliate, politically or physically.

5. Because its not about money. He wasnt paying John and John didnt want money. She knew John had an oath and he had to keep it. John cannot be bought, otherwise Yosef and Viggo wouldnt be dead. She probably also figured John would kill him after he offed her. This was hinted when she told him about the collapse of the power structure of the Underworld upon her death. ",5t4u0w

Judo was a big aspect of his fighting style. He did a lot of that in his fight scenes. Jujistu too, which is easily identifiable. Nice touch, especially with the use of guns in those fights.

de3845r,"Santino needed his sister killed in order to take over her seat on the High Council. Santino could not do this himself, personally, for two reasons: ""blood"" (ambiguous if that actually mattered to him), and that the High Council would declare war on Santino. We know this from the conversation with the King/L. Fishbourne, after Wick tells the King of Santino's plans to take over New York. If the King attacks Santino, he risks the wrath of the Council. Santino using Wick to kill his sister gives him plausible deniability, hence why he needed Wick dead, to remove the loose ends. 

From what we saw, D'Antonio is not a man of honor. He promised to let John go and return to his life of peace after the job was complete. Obviously, this was not the case. To say he would have left Wick alone had he not returned, we can't be certain. He was more than likely biding his time, waiting until it was absolutely necessary to use Wick. Santino saying that he did not want to use Wick could have just been the smoke blowing up his ass to convince him to do the job, otherwise he would be killed.

Santino did not want to kill Wick until after the job is complete, that's why he blew up the house. Yes, he could have turned the Marker in to the Continental saying Wick would not do the job, effectively killing him. But that means Santino would need to find someone else, someone good enough to do it, someone he would need to pay twice for. Once for the contract on his sister, and again to get his vengeance. There's also the possibility that he would have had to register the hit on his sister should he pay cash, going through the Continental and it being in the system, meaning more evidence against him.

Wick shoots the corpse to make sure the job is complete. In both movies, we see Winston has a fondness for Wick, so it wouldn't be outrageous for him to do what he can to help Wick.

I think the same will happen to Common as well, he clearly didn't die on that train so it's very possible that he's going to show up again, perhaps an asset for John in the future since he is now enemy number 1.

I understand a blood oath is sacred and it's a rule you don't break, but couldn't John have just gone to the Council and explained what Santino wanted him to do?

Not that that's a flaw to the movie, or anything. I think it's clear that these characters are purposefully like that. Probably for the same reason serial killers leave hints.",5t4u0w

ddr7q0v,"At the time I didn't think it was about the bounty, it was about John's membership to the Continental being revoked.  In the first film, Winston brought a handful of guys for Ms. Perkins, so it was believable to me that he'd bring all of those people for John Wick.",5t4u0w

dean4dc,"Yep. To me the most unbelievable part was when they talked about 7 million dollars being a lot of money. Dawg, you have an international society of assassins geared up in top of the line equipment going around murdering people. There is no way we are talking about 7 figures here.",5t4u0w

ddke7vt,"Similar in that it upped the action, introduced new and interesting characters, and expanded the world. But also similar in that it lost some of the charm of the original. I enjoyed John Wick 2 a lot, but the original was just such a tight and focused film.         

Definitely recommend John Wick 2 to anyone. Its a fun action film that delivers on almost every level for action fans, it gives a lot to chew on by expanding the world as well. But it's not quite the original. But how could it be?",5t4u0w

ddq16pe,"That part really bugged me in the first movie, where there was more of an attempt at ""realism"", but the second movie goes to such lengths to establish a universe totally based around this massive, bizarre, barely-underground society of hired killers (like, New York seems to be composed of 25% assassins) that it kinda makes sense that police are a non-entity. ",5t4u0w
ddnsk7j,Honestly I wouldn't wanna get in johns way if I were them,5t4u0w
dean7y8,Well I guess it just wasn't shown. I wish they sprinkled a little bit more realism in it though by having some random people notice a bloody man running by obviously holding a gun.,5t4u0w
ddk6vrk,"Ya, I definitely agree with the influence to clear a park thing. It's definitely not everyone in the world is an assassin. Though if that's true that means there's a version of me in this universe that can kick some ass. That's a happy thought",5t4u0w
ddk71qd,"The entire planet thing was just an exaggeration. Point is the film sets it up as though everyone is involved in some shape or form, especially since it bleeds into John's ensuing paranoia as he hobbles out of the park.",5t4u0w
ddmex3h,"I can believe in clearing out the park, but it's gets much stranger, when you consider that they made all assassins to roleplay.",5t4u0w

ddk8nac,"Good for you, I guess?",5t4u0w

Did you also notice in the beginning the orange/brown wooden boxes in the Tarasov warehouse that were put in the trunk and a couple of scenes later you see Winston saying that the gold coins are impeccable? It's the scene on the rooftop with the old guy just before he and John have that conversation why he refused the marker. It's the same box. I don't know if that's a coincidence or if it's related to the story, but i think Winston is the King of the whole underworld and The Tarasov Family works for Winston. If you look at the scene at the end of Chapter 2 you see how big his reach is. There is like a 100 assassins ready to take out John on that square and all Winston does is blink and the assassins just walk away. Even Santino couldn't overpower Winston when he asked if John's license to the continental could be revoked. And Santino is/was one of the twelve members of the high table. It wouldn't surprise me if Winston is the head of the high table and all the continentals.

FYI:

I found a direct quote from Stormare himself from 8 months ago on Collider about his role in Chapter 2:

I think the same simplicity that you keep talking about is what made John Wick so popular, and you are in the sequel for that. What appealed to you about getting to work with Keanu Reeves again?

STORMARE:  I’m not in it much. Me and Keanu have been friends for a long time. He flies under the radar, like me. He does a lot of odd projects and independent movies, and people never understand what the hell he’s doing and why he’s not doing Speed 9 or The Matrix 6. He said that, because people love making three movies, he wanted me to be the main character in the third movie and for people to meet me in the second.

ddt2r35,"Yeah, you have a point there. I think story wise and character development is something they can improve on with the third chapter. Same thing with Winston, Charon and Aurelio. These are all interesting characters, but they get only one or two scenes in both movies which is a shame. Same thing goes for Abram Tarasov. John kills his brother and nephew and does nothing. That's not believable. He's a Russian crime boss for christ sake. But hey for first time directors and first time writers they did a pretty good job so far.",5t4u0w
ddt6azc,I assume someone owes john a blood oathe and that marker shows it. John would have no right to make a new blood oathe as he's ex communicated. Could argue that whoever owes the oathe has no obligation to honor it now that he's ex communicated. To show the oathe b/w John and santino you'd need more than just the marker.

It's a creepy old woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga)- Baba is short for Babushka or granny. So they're calling this notorious hitman ""Granny Boogeyman,"" essentially.

The part that bugged me about the sequel was Wick getting dragged back into the job by a stereotypical Italian gangster. I guess it would have been lamer if he just been like ""Alright, one more job,"" but blowing up his house with incendiary grenades immediately after the refusal struck me as kind of dumb.

After John kills Antonio's sister, Ian McShane asks Antonio to Mark the Marker complete. Antonio then has to put his thumb print in blood on the other side of the Marker finishing it.

So Markers are a form of IOU that have to to be respected.

Ian McShane giving John Wick a Marker at the end is probably a way that John can ask for help sometime down the line even though he is excommunicated. ",5t4u0w
di29gds,"That's how I interpreted it to. In the beginning D'Antonio says ""you came to me in your hour of need"" or something like that. A marker is taken seriously because it is unacceptable to not honor one.  And with John Wick's capabilities he could use that in a pinch.",5t4u0w

But then again, maybe Keanu isn't capable of bringing that layer of menace to his acting. Look at Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. People thought he'd be terrible in the role and, physically, he doesn't match the character from the book. In the end, he was menacing enough (but not overtly) that you kinda forget about his size or his looks. 

Also agree that Keanu's got that Zen detachment look down. Worked for him in The Matrix too. I think that just stems from how he is in real life. Not very showy and is fairly simple guy.

Enjoyable, but damn this was overrated. I guess I can understand the 90% on RT. I'd give it a thumbs up versus a thumbs down even though it's a weak one, and RT only cares about binary good or bad determinations.

Chapter 2s bad guy was OK. Personality was OK, not funny, nothing special , he just seemed to serve his purpose. 

Comparing the 2, chapter 1s is a much stronger character and protagonist ",5t4u0w
ddnbnr4,"Disagree, and here's why:

When a trailer shows something, a part of me anticipates it. So throughout the entire movie, I was anticipating the final scene between John and Winston at the fountain. After John's choice, I knew why that scene was happening and it possessed zero impact or surprise in context.

ddl4en6,"Yeah, I saw a little bit of that, but John never seems to 'deal' with that or even acknowledge it. Really, that's what bugs me: I didn't feel connected to John Wick and his story in this movie, because we never get to understand why he is doing what he is doing. He just does things because the plot says he has to. In the first movie, it was clear why John was killing and chasing: they murdered his dog, the living, breathing reminder of his late wife, and he gets a full monologue in the middle of the film to really make that clear. Here, John Wick loses his home and is forced out of retirement because of a choice he refused to make. Then, he kills every henchmen he faces until he kills the guy that did the forcing. He's never given an opportunity to 'feel' or express his reasons and goals behind what he is doing, or at least I didn't get that impression. 

Look, I'm not trying to hate on the movie, or search for a reason to. The reason I loved the first is because of how relatable John Wick's conviction was (and then also the enormously awesome action). With this movie, I feel like I got all of the action, but not nearly as much substance that helped me identify with the character before.",5t4u0w
ddl3lj3,"Well, when I say 'intelligent', I mean that the film is concise, thought-out, and non-pandering. While John Wick 1 is a 'Popcorn Flick"", it also isn't dumb. The movie is astonishingly efficient, in both the writing, the editing, and the directing. Nothing about the film is needless, or silly, or overly serious. To me, this gives it 'intelligence'. Sure, this isn't Interstellar, but it also isn't The Fast and The Furious, or Transformers. Perhaps 'brilliant' is a better word for what I'm trying to say.

You are right, it is basic, but that isn't a bad thing or a slight against how smart of a movie it is. It's just a quality that only adds to how outstanding it is.

In terms of cliches, the first John Wick utilized and, then defied, a lot of action movie conventions. He's a lone gunman/ a legend/ a martial artist/ a quiet killing machine/a gruff, hardened badass, etc., out for revenge against a crime world/former employer/mafia syndicate who did him wrong(in this case, killed his dog, but the mcguffin could be anything). Except, things are not that simple: 

 - Yes, John Wick is that badass, but all he wants is to be left alone and NOT kill. He isn't a ""white-hat-hero"" either, he's just as bad as the villain in terms of morality, but what makes him different is in how he was innocently wronged, deserving none of what is inflicted upon him, and his plight is easily relatable to the audience. 

 - Yes, the crime family did him wrong, but unintentionally and they show a great deal of regret for the mistake. The father character is almost just as sympathetic to the audience as John Wick is, because he didn't actually have a hand in the situations that inspired John Wick's vengeance, and yet he still has to accept the consequences for his son's misdeeds.

- Yes, there is a Mcguffin that sets up the events of the film, but it isn't the hero's partner, lover, or anything else quite so typical or 'cheap'; it's his pet. And the villain did not steal or murder it for any other reason except because he's a spoiled asshole who wanted a car, and didn't like being turned down. And even the act of killing the man's dog wasn't exactly what set John Wick off, it's really about what the dog meant to him: his late wife and the short life he enjoyed with her. By murdering that dog, Theon Greyjoy not only destroyed a cherished memory and loved one, but also disrespected and defiled everything John Wick cherished. 

John Wick's motivations in this simple action movie is probably the most nuanced and heart-breaking character development I've seen in an action film. And it isn't just an excuse to shoot some cool action scenes and sell some tickets. It's impact and weight is allowed to be felt by the audience, and the character retains the same level of commitment and devotion to his cause throughout the film. There are no ridiculous one-liners, or weird mood shifts for the sake of pleasing a desired audience. He literally is without joy or any semblance of happiness, and we *feel* that with him. Even up to the end, where he decides to take in a dog, an action that is just as bitter as it is sweet. We feel, just as he does, that there is no replacing what he lost, but he has to cope with that the best way he can.

But, that's just how I feel. Others may not agree with me, and that's okay. Another thing that makes this movie so great is that its so simple and effective in every way, that literally anyone can appreciate it however they choose.",5t4u0w

",5t4u0w
ddsrtep,"1. He got in way too easily through the catacombs, undetected, then expects to walk out like nothing happened through the front door, while he is a well known assassin.

2. He knew very well, he'll need the guns in the catacombs, however did not plan with enough ammo, nor with enough guns. He could have also prepared with explosives to make his life easier, but did not.

3. He knew, they'll fuck him over. Could have come up with a better plan, than waltz in and shoot everyone. He just made peace with the Russians, they could have helped.

4. No police anywhere. In Europe, police cars are quite frequent, and shootings are rare. Massive shootings in any public area would have brought on hundreds of policemen in minutes, and the public would have ran scared shitless.

5. Payments: Gold is nice, but those gold coins are worth around 500-1000 USD (depends on the weight). Now the weapons he purchased with 6-10 coins costs way more in Europe, where are strict gun laws in act, than in the US. He may have been able to buy those weapons for 10 coins in the US (probably even less), but not in Europe. The clothing would alone costs ~100K-250K USD.
John goes around like a millionaire. The house easily costs several millions. The cost-benefit ratios in the movie are fucked up.
You pay for 2 drinks with a coin, you pay the same for entrance fee to the club, you pay the same for 1 night in a luxury hotel for assassins (cheaper than many other hotels).

6: The cost of killing John Wick: John slaughtered ~100 people in the movie, the weaponry, the people, and the collateral damage (museum, buildings) alone costs way more than the 7 million bounty. Either every other assassin is a cheap, broke - not exactly shown like that - or everyone is millionaire. In that case, 7 million is peanuts.

7. EVERYONE is an assassin. Anywhere John goes, he trips off alarms with 100 people at least.",5t4u0w

The best sequences were not based on Wick's mortality, but rather answered (or produced) questions which furthered the plot.

* In the subway: Common seems important, but is he dead? Is he going to come back for Wick before the end of this movie? Will he be in chapter 3? Whose the homeless guy he gives the coin to help hide him?

de3or9g,"Yes Winston helped him out with a bit of information in the first one because it wasn't business, it was personal. That seemed to be the only reason he allowed work on his property. But for fondness to undermine the established rules kind of kills the rules for me.

Santino had way more faceless henchmen and in the first flick the girl was willing to risk the wrath of continental for what 4million. It would have been just as easy to promise the favor of the new king to any random assassin that is everyone by the way in person and kill them if they refuse. Couldn't do it himself? So like personally? Cuz sending any hitman to do your bidding is still him doing it. As far as denying it, it would be easier to just send someone that could actually be killed not Mr invincible that tells everyone on his way back after killing everyone sent to exact your revenge 5 mins after the death of the sister. You can't deny that he knew, if he's trying to take revenge 10 steps out the door unless a major part of santinos forces job is to sit around his sisters place ready to exact immediate revenge on whoever kills her. Why were they there? In the eyes of any sane person. His main bodyguard type chick would most reasonably be with him in New York on any given day not Rome.

dds56nq,"So Winston is God in this story. God has a number of angels who will do his bidding (the assassins). In exchange they get tokens to spend for anything in his kingdom (assume each token is worth one wish of a lifetime). God doesn't really have a bidding, but instead creates a market for his bidding which anyone can play in (either a call or put if you are an assassin or someone who needs work done). God makes absolute laws that cannot be broken by his angels (the assassins). These include: don't fight in heaven, don't kill innocents, and respect my currency. The dial can be thought of as a personal favor from God that must be respected. Any failure to abide by the rules gets you cast out of heaven and it's joys (the hotel and affiliations).

Other things:

* Bum king is a market speculator
* Wick is Lucifer or the most powerful angel falling from grace
* The old technology shows that God has been around for a while
* Anyone can enter God's grace and be an angel (be in the market)
* Some angels are much better than others
* God loves Wick more

ddlvvb9,"I feel like the ending was a little unclear. The reason everyone freezes is Winston showing John that he can be killed at any time, but he doesn't have him killed right there because of their friendship. Also the reason he gave John an hour.

The call to make John excommunicado is a little unclear though because I think being excommunicado just means that any services and alliances that John was using before in the past is no longer available to him. I don't think it sets a contract on him. Like I said though it's unclear because [Ms. Perkins got killed for doing business on Continental grounds, so maybe you just get a contract on you automatically when you do that.](#spoiler)

Quick edit:

Let's assume some things real quick. In the first movie John [threatens Viggo with a shotgun and forces him to take the contract off of John and give him the whereabouts of his son. Then John kills Iosef and later on kills Viggo for killing Marcus (Willem Dafoe).](#spoiler)

In this movie [John kills Santino in the restaurant on Continental grounds](#spoiler). Would there still be a contract on John for $7 million or should we assume that the contract is no longer on? Because in the first movie John didn't need to kill Viggo to get the contract taken off. What happens if the person who sets the contract dies? We know that no business can be conducted on Continental grounds. That it's a neutral zone of sorts, but they never explicitly state that death is the penalty. It's inferred/implied and later on shown, but not explicitly stated. Maybe we should assume that it is the penalty because at the end [John starts running, so he's either running from the $7 million contract that is maybe still on him or from the penalty for killing on Continental grounds](#spoiler)",5t4u0w

It might be a necessary evil for an awesome John Wick 3. We won't know until that is made! But I just found John Wick 1 to be a lot more unfettered and surprising, versus a lot of the construction work done by John Wick 2.

Some of the dialogue was poor, as well, with some parts of the film doing too much hand holding for the world-building. Exposition is inevitable in films, but it was a bit flimsy and on the nose at certain points here. My only other complaint with John Wick 2 is that there was not an emotional hook that invested Wick in the proceedings like there was in the first film. He was doing it simply to survive, which kind of distances the audience from the proceedings. Rama in the Raid 2 at least had a motivation to protect his family when he took the undercover assignment. I think the Raid 2 had better choreography, editing, and cinematography than both John Wick films. That is the high mark for modern action because of how smooth the film feels while having a lot of movement and quick cuts.

Meaning they don't have to be directly related to any Continental businesses. The homeless guy was just an undercover hitman, so he definitely could've used the coin for something is how I see it.  

Fishbourne doesn't want Santino to get a High Table position because that would increase his power, allowing him to encroach on Fishbourne's territory. At the same time, Fishbourne sort of doesn't want to give John a gun because there is a 7 million bounty on John's head, and seeing John doesn't have gun, Fishbourne could've easily claimed the bounty for himself. 

The scene where they talk is mainly Fishbourne deciding whether to claim the bounty, or give John a gun to kill Santino, saving Fishbourne's territory. 

I think the subtext here is that all these organizations (the Continental, the High Table, the mafia, Fishbourne's group etc) seem to be largely independent of each other, and only loosely connected. It makes more sense that way, Fishbourne isn't automatically loyal to Santino just because he's on the High table. ",5t4u0w

So I don't know if this is a writers error or that Winston really has the power to decide who dies and who doesn't.

Like killing all the members of the high table so that Winston becomes the head of the high table. There are many answers. I think we just have to wait and see chapter 3.

Excommunicado means that he no longer has resources of the continentals. Meaning: no guns, no safe haven, no car (that's why Aurelio also got a text message at the end, because he is fixing his car).

dixn9m0,"Winston had chosen the spot, though. Sealing off an area so that no regular people are strolling by and then filling it with your people is actually pretty easy - film makers do it most of the time when they shoot a scene outside, for example. 

What's tricky is doing it so subtly that an elite hitman in full-on paranoia mode doesn't notice. For that you need a whole bunch of people who might not be great assassins, but nonetheless are competent, loyal and comfortable with the secret assassin underworld thing. For example, the staff at the Continental.

Winston makes his little display - that he can control any area and do it so invisibly not even John Wick will see the strings - and meanwhile back at the hotel everyone's hopelessly spamming the room service button and wondering where all the maids and busboys are.",5t4u0w

di9hfxh,"This is what almost ruined the film for me on the spot. 

Initially it seemed that the Continental Hotel (along with its seductive underworld of impeccably stylish goons) thrived on a particular standard of secrecy and exclusivity. Which would explain why it can just sit there, in broad daylight, hiding in plain sight. 

Fast forward to the sequel and we have this odd scene at the end where the entire crowd of people freeze and turn to stare at John like a bunch of brainless lemmings. It isn't clever; it's totally contrived; and it feels like they've been rehearsing the damn thing all day. This is immediately followed by John running for his life, and what seems like half the population of New York city being texted the details of his contract.

The idea of a secret society of assassins lurking within the general hustle and bustle of a metropolis is not exactly original (it's also explored in the Kingsman films), but it works within the Wick universe because the filmmakers lend it an air of eccentric chic and creative mystique. 

Then they decide to destroy the intrigue by implying that any Simpleton Pete, Joe Halfwit and Billy Boggs can stroll in barefoot and sign up for membership. How fucking boring - no wonder John wants out!",5t4u0w
diuijio,"> But maybe that's what the director wanted. Just a regular dude with a dog who you wouldn't think is menacing unless you knew who he was. He's not particularly built or physically imposing (like say Daniel Craig or Jason Statham), but the menace then comes from what he can do, not how he looks.

Totally agree. I think it is what the director wanted. And I always viewed it as ""I don't really want to be doing this."" Super blaise and what a hassle attitude

I imagine when he was full time he was a lot more menacing/evil. 

Especially everyone welcoming him back he's kind of just sighing about it. What really sealed this deal was when he goes gun shopping. And the man wishes him ""Happy hunting.""

To be honest, this is what I love about Keanu Reeves, and I'm really happy he got this role. He seems so full of humility and integrity, and that is what he has brought to the role.

de3qs9k,"> Yes Winston helped him out with a bit of information in the first one because it wasn't business, it was personal. That seemed to be the only reason he allowed work on his property. But for fondness to undermine the established rules kind of kills the rules for me.

He didn't allow work on his property. The girl attacked Wick in his room, and then killed the man responsible for containing her. She thought the reward money was worth going against the rules. She failed, and died. From every interaction we've seen between Wick and Winston, there's a clear fondness between the two.

> It would have been just as easy to promise the favor of the new king to any random assassin that is everyone by the way in person and kill them if they refuse.

Not necessarily. People start disappearing, that raises questions. It draws unwanted attention. And he has complete control over Wick with the Marker, which is something you can't buy. Everyone being assassins, I'm assuming you mean the scene at the end where Winston gives him an hour, is to show that he can't hide forever, he'll always be hunted.

>Couldn't do it himself? So like personally? Cuz sending any hitman to do your bidding is still him doing it.  

Santino mentions in the museum at the beginning that he can't do it himself because they're ""blood."" But we know that his word is worthless. He couldn't personally do it because he can't be the prime suspect. If you remember the scene where Winston and Santino are talking about the Marker, Santino is reluctant to admit it's complete and been used.

>As far as denying it, it would be easier to just send someone that could actually be killed not Mr invincible that tells everyone on his way back after killing everyone sent to exact your revenge 5 mins after the death of the sister.

Why pay someone and risk it not getting it done, when you have someone who is required to do your bidding and is damn near guaranteed to get the job done. The only people I remember him telling are Cassian, Winston, and the King. Could Wick have eventually been able to clear his name with the Council? It's possible, but Cassian having his ""eye for an eye"" vengeance, and Santino putting the bounty on his head, he would never be able to live long enough to speak to them.

> You can't deny that he knew, if he's trying to take revenge 10 steps out the door unless a major part of santinos forces job is to sit around his sisters place ready to exact immediate revenge on whoever kills her. Why were they there? In the eyes of any sane person. His main bodyguard type chick would most reasonably be with him in New York on any given day not Rome.

Can't deny who knew what? Who are you speaking about here? If you're talking about Gianna's body guards, naturally they would be hunting for Wick once word got out at the coronation event. If you're talking about Santino's men, they were there to kill Wick, to ensure no loose ends. There's specifically a conversation between Wick and Ares where they establish there will be no loose ends. If plans had gone accordingly, Gianna would have died, Wick would have been killed in the catacombs, and Santino would get the seat. I don't think he ever intended to sign the Marker stating it was used, hence the hesitancy mentioned earlier.

> The loss of memory of his wife is kind of a moot point as he by rights should have lost his life there and then. The flashbacks after he gets home with the car showed memories associated the car and he had no worries about trashing that to get the job done.

ddnc39c,"Not the original commenter, but in short there are three things to consider for safety while handling a firearm. The NRA refers to these as the three rules. Rule Number One is unquestionably the most important: always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot is Rule Number Two on the NRA list. Rule Number Three: ALWAYS keep the gun unloaded until ready to use.

So in short, make sure it isn't loaded, don't point it at anything you don't intend to destroy, and keep your finger off the trigger. If you do at least one of those things, you'll never have an accident. 

When I worked armed security, my firearm was always loaded, and if I had to draw it meant I might have to fire at whatever or whoever I was pointing at. My training therefore focused on keeping my finger off the trigger until ready to fire. It was the only protection from negligent discharge, and for people who point firearms at others for a living, it's the most sacred rule.

For John Wick, this rule doesn't apply. You're exactly right - it's a split second he doesn't have. But it's simpler, even. John Wick intends to destroy everything he aims at. ",5t4u0w

That's how you know they're exceptionally trained and disciplined. And that's how you also avoid friendly fire in combat. ",5t4u0w

Eh. The H&K P30 is a superior weapon system out of the box. Stock Glock grips and sights are trash and the Glock trigger isn't much better. The only real knock on the P30 is the long reset on the stock trigger and that can be fixed with about thirty dollars worth of parts straight from HK. 

Once you start getting into changing internal components, it becomes pretty much a wash, with the Glock suddenly starting to cost as much as the P30 it's shooting as well as. 

Personally, I like the P30s DA/SA action over the Glock's striker (I grew up on 1911s and a SIG P226, so I have a massive soft spot for SA trigger pulls).

Glocks are more prevalent because they're cheaper. You can pick up a Glock 17/19 for dirt cheap compared to the P30.

>  I'm assuming you mean the scene at the end where Winston gives him an hour, is to show that he can't hide forever, he'll always be hunted.

Hunted and cut off from use of assets are very different. There is no contract on him that has anyone alive to pay the bounty when he is running at the end.

So John Wick walking around town saying that Santino sent him covers that?

That is still too many people to close loose ends.

If you're talking about Santino's men, they were there to kill Wick, to ensure no loose ends. There's specifically a conversation between Wick and Ares where they establish there will be no loose ends. If plans had gone accordingly, Gianna would have died, Wick would have been killed in the catacombs, and Santino would get the seat. 

Santino, if he wanted plausible deniability why would his goons be there? Surely he had to expect a few corpses in the catacombs to take out Wick. As stated by you that should bring about questions.

ddnhldi,"We'll have to agree to disagree there. The car chase, handicap fight, and kitchen fight were all much more memorable in The Raid 2 for me. When I said Evans understands escalation of action better, the Kitchen fight is the best example of this. It starts off as martial arts, becomes a brawl, then the hero has to even the playing field when the knives come out, then it climaxes with both characters chopping the hell out of one another. A lot of people do not notice the brilliant use of music in the scene, either. There is none for the first half or more of the sequence, but as it nears the end, the music begins to slowly come in, and by the time Rama had a knife, too, the score is huge and magnificent. There are not any scenes in the John Wick films that gave me goosebumps the way that did. 

 John Wick 2 repeated too many of the same moves in the action scenes. He even gets ran over by a car twice, and both times a fistfight ensues. JW2 may have looked slicker, but I liked the more natural look of The Raid 2 as opposed to the muted colors of Wick. Wick 2 also had about four times the budget of The Raid 2, so I am more than confident Evans would do circles around Stahelski if given a budget that size. The Wick films also lacked badass kills for the ""boss"" characters. Both Raid movies kill the badass bad guys in spectacular fashion because Evans knows now to pay off the build up to his hero facing down equally skilled combatants. In Wick 2, the climax with the deaf girl was one of the least exciting parts of the movie because John just slaps her around and stabs her in the chest in almost the same manner he did Cassian on the train. I just thought the director became a little lazy with some of the staging, because it began to repeat itself as the movie went on, where as The Raid 2 just kept upping the ante at every single turn. The best parts of JW2 were the street fight with Cassian and the montage of hitmen trying to off Wick and him killing them in all sorts of ridiculous ways.",5t4u0w

For what it's worth, I never literally thought everyone in the city was an assassin, the scene just gives off that vibe. I couldn't square that level of public secret agent exposure with the almost quaint and anachronistic bellhop-style elegance of the Continental's interior (one of the best inventions of this franchise). Perhaps others here will feel differently. 

I never actually thought of the end scene in terms of John's possibly fractured state of mind preying on him. It does makes a lot of sense. Despite my nitpicking, it was really just that end scene I had a big problem with. Had it not been included, I probably wouldn't have required any further explanations or exposition whatsoever.

In all other respects, I think the general world building is terrific, because they've done it subtly, wittily, and incrementally. I also think revealing the use of markers feels totally in keeping with the general and overarching strict agenda (ie. absolutely no business to be conducted on premises lest one become excommunicado).

Even better is the concealed back office where the contracts are put out by phone call to ""accounts payable"", popped through a chute, and then routed by a prehistoric telex network until mobile phones are pinging all over New York (and the rest of the world). It's very clever how they seem to have styled the desk clerks as a cross between women from the 1940s and tattooed Brooklyn hipsters. A really fine touch.

Also, despite the list of other complaints I have about the sequel, I still loved it as much as you; it's just a gas! There's something about these films that leaves me totally hopped up and buzzing for hours, and that makes me forgive almost everything else. Also, the character acting by Ian McShane and Lance Reddick make an absolute meal out of even the smallest and most innocuous scene.

de4fka4,"> So a fondness trumps the rules. Why would anyone follow them then? John breaks the rules and succeeds, yet gets to walk away.

They follow the rules because without them there would be chaos. Yes, fondness slightly trumps rules here, because of their relationship. Winston gives Wick a chance, because he knows Wick was screwed over. There was a conversation about the need to adhere to the rules between the two, about how he needed to accept the Marker. He doesn't get to walk away peacefully, the Council put a global $14,000,000 hit on him. The excommunicado means he can't use the services of the Continental, and isn't protected by whatever other rules they have.

> Hunted and cut off from use of assets are very different. There is no contract on him that has anyone alive to pay the bounty when he is running at the end.

Yes there is, the Council doubles Santino's contract.

> So John Wick walking around town saying that Santino sent him covers that?

It doesn't, he was never supposed to make it out of the catacombs.

> That is still too many people to close loose ends.

In any case, it would just be hearsay at first, difficult to prove. Eventually, Wick might be able to make a case, sparing his life. Santino needed Wick killed because dead men tell no tales.

> Santino, if he wanted plausible deniability why would his goons be there? Surely he had to expect a few corpses in the catacombs to take out Wick. As stated by you that should bring about questions. ""How was it you were able to enact your plan of revenge minutes after your sister was killed?"" would be one on my mind if i was in the council for instance.

He could have had men in Rome for a number of reasons. Maybe his sister requested extra security. Maybe Ares was sent in Santino's place, as an ambassador. What's more likely, Santino (meaning him as a political figure) having an envoy at the coronation as a sign of respect, or not being there and having no representation? Being completely absent would raise a lot more questions.

> This is the only thing we seem to agree on. Yet in saying that there are flashbacks where he is remembering his wife with the car so that can't be irrelivant.

The car isn't irrelevant, but it can be fixed.

In this film he was clearly upset about ex-communicating John, but had to do it as per the rules.

What's that shit about? My point still stands, Winston bent his own rules in order to give John (someone who will take an inch and make it a mile) an hour to live. That can only mean he is hoping John will survive.

Why the fuck didn't this happen to John?:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQqwsTgGcmM

Unless Winston has a relationship with him beyond a business one.

Think about it, mate. I get what you are saying - but there is no bending the rules. It's mentioned a dozen times in both movies.

""Need I remind you gentlemen, that there is NO business on Continental grounds.""

Not ""There is no business but if you are just finishing up a fight from outside, go ahead and commit a murder on Continental grounds.""

Also take note of the fact, that John and the guy played by Common enter Continental grounds accidentally earlier on in the film, and immediately stop fighting and take it to the bar for a drink.

Why didn't they just finish what started outside? Because those are the fucking rules. Period.

So John broke the Continental rules just as badly as Ms. Perkins, but she gets a bullet to the head within half a second of learning about her ex-communication, and John gets an hour to run...

Winston is the only factor involved that changed the outcome. He gave John that hour, because they have a relationship with him beyond simple business.

if the Marker worked as you said it did, why did no one just throw one at John in the first movie?
