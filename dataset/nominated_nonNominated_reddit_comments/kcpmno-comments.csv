gfuwg9r,"Finally! I‚Äôm so glad I found the discussion thread for this movie, because this is by far one of my favorite animated movies ever.

The scene when Robyn first ran with Meph after turning into a wolf was by far one of the most beautifully animated scenes I‚Äôve seen in a long time. The color, the shadows and the fluid movement of the wolves were all just eye candy for animation lovers. 

But my favorite part? After the Lord Protector commits suicide and Goodfellowe, Meph, her mother, and Robyn were all in the carriage driving away, the Lord Protector‚Äôs own horse was pulling them. I just love how they adopted him, a really cool detail in my opinion.

Go see this film now. It‚Äôs amazing.",kcpmno

gftnrgd,"I don't think a prettier hand-drawn film exists anywhere on the planet right now. Those scenes with the wolf vision must have taken so much work to draw, and it's easy to imagine a CGI film just using some fancy filter if faced with the same challenge. Using rough line-work to characterize is also such a dang genius touch.

I really wish the script were tighter, and honestly all the Cartoon Saloon movies I've seen before kind of suffer from this, with some emotional moments going on for too long. The Goodfellowes especially make some, hmmm, questionable decisions that seem more tailored to drive the drama forward than to make sense, and their arcs aren't as elegant as the artwork - they come around on the whole ""being a pagan werewolf"" thing pretty dang fast.

I wonder where Cartoon Saloon will go next, if there's still any more stories they can set in Ireland when they've already covered a lot of their mythologies. The Kells artstyle is practically signature at this point, but it's hard to imagine it working well in any other setting. Still, I am super glad that they're still making such quality works a decade after Secret of Kells.",kcpmno

gju4x1n,"I know this I'm a little late with this comment, but there is so much beauty in Wolfwalkers I couldn't help it.

( Caution: Geeky rant ahead)

For instance, I love the art style so much. The detail in the different settings is astounding, and Cartoon Saloon's stylized way of showing depth is one of my favorites in animation. The character's fluid designs are nothing to scoff at either. Im so glad that they stuck to a more traditional style, especially because sometimes you can still see the sketch lines used for the bases. It's great if you're just learning how to animate since all of the prep is still there. It makes the animation feel raw, which I like a lot. 

Let's not forget the characters themselves. I know that some people see them as a bit one dimensional,  but I don't see that way at all. Robyn and Mebh are young, which is why I consider there personalities to be constantly developing, that also means they won't recognize more complex emotions yet. 

For Robyn, shes trying to continue as she was in England, and finding out that's not possible anymore. Over the course of the story, we get to see her grow stronger, and learn new emotions. Namely, fear, loss of freedom, courage, and new perspective.

In Mebh's case, she's learning to live without a parental figure and likely has feelings of abandonment. When robyn comes around she doesn't feel so alone, which she one of the reasons she feels so betrayed when Robyn asks her to ""Take Merlin and go."". In a way, Mebh likely thinks Robyn is leaving her too.

I really loved Robyn's father too. He has a very real fear that the world could turn on him, and cautions Robyn from being reckless. He's actually one of the very few parental figures that feel real to me. Many parental characters in children's films bother me, because they don't seem to care that their child (often the protagonist) nearly got themselves killed. It's borderline negligent. Unlike many animated parents, Goodfellow is a responsible adult doesn't expect his daughter to fix his problems. 

I wish there was more screen time for Mebh's mother so there was more to analyze, but there's still plenty to talk about. For instance, she is an enigma throughout the story, which pushes the plot forward. She also is a caring parent, which makes two good parents for the win!

Anyways, I'm done typing for now.

gixvpjl,"SPOILER ALERT

Good film.

Not bad, but not great. IMPO I think Cartoon Saloon's strongest films are Song Of the Sea and The Breadwinner.

Strengths.
Art. every shot...*chefs kiss* every shot is like a desktop wallpaper for me.

Characters. Robyn, Mebh, and Bill(father) play their expected roles. A wannabe hunter, a feral defensive child, and an overprotective fearful dad. But what makes them better than archetypes, is that they play their archetypes stories differently. Mebh is curious, playful, and yet defensive about her mother. Robyn wants to be a wolf hunter, but abandons it, society, and her father to be a Wolfwalker in the woods. Overprotective father, instead of rage being a usual depiction of this from a male parent. We see Father, actually be crippled in fear by Lord protector, and is on the verge of tears when Robyn is crying about being forbidden to leave or do anything other than what Lord protector or what he says.

Themes of fear. Initially, wolves/forest/nature are to be feared in the beginning of the film, but as our character Robyn spends time with Mebh and becomes a Wolfwalker she learns that its more freeing to leave society, and makes the painful decision to leave her father, with her sleeping body (emotional scene). And later her Father leaves society too.
Interesting points.
The thing I enjoy about having Father and Robyn be English, is that they are not completely welcomed in Ireland during the setting of the film(colonialism), and Father works for Lord Protector. The Irish dont bother to hide thier disdain/hate for Lord Protector, but follow his orders due to severe punishment and fear. So in a sense Robyn and Father become ""Irish"" at the end of the film by fighting Lord Protector, and going away with Mebh and her Mother, and embracing the Wolfwalker way.
I found the ending bittersweet, cause while the setting is historical (but not completely). Ireland's native wolves have been extinct, cause of the real Lord Protector. So...while at this point of time in the film the Wolfwalkers succeed, we know they dont cause wolves will be gone from Ireland.

Weakness.
Too simple.
""Girl finds nature side, and embraces/leaves society.""
That pretty much sums up the movie.

Father: while I understand Father is overprotective because he is a father, we dont see why he is at that extent. And If anything Father's choice to become a Wolfwalker (I say choice, cause of his choice to leave society. Not on attacking Lord protector,  because any good parent would fight to the death against anyone trying to kill their child) is fueled by his over protectiveness to Robyn. So... idk on how to feel about that.",kcpmno
gkq0k3x,Loved this movie. The animation was so beautiful. I‚Äôd like to know more about the cultural history. Did it more or less portray the time period accurately?,kcpmno
gfs24pi,"The art style was so amazing! Very refreshing to see a non-3D animation not from Japan. Robyn and Mebg were both likable, and their voice acting were also great. 

My only problem with it was Robyn‚Äôs father‚Äôs character. I knew that Robyn would eventually have to confront him and convince him that Wolves are not evil, but his character felt way too stubborn until the very end. I think it would have been better to see more of a gradual change.

Overall this was a really fun movie with refreshing art style and likeable main characters.",kcpmno

With that being said, every time I felt like something bad was going to happen, it didn't. It kind of felt odd, and I don't know if it ultimately helped the story. I mean, even Pixar films have tragic events in their films. Many classics like The Lion King were so impactful because of certain tragic events. Not sure how I felt about that here.

Also, why was the father (wolf) holding the Lord Protector for so long over the cliff?? What was he waiting for? lol",kcpmno

but the artwork? Its garbage. I understand it is a style choice, but it is just plain bad, with obvious attempts to 'make' it look childish/mature (Colors not even inside lines, perspective off kilter, etc) and the animation is.. well, again, very, very amateur. But after seeing tons and tons of people reviewing it saying just the opposite, I wonder what it is I am missing.
