They took Dory and instead of constantly beating you with ""remember how funny it is when she forgets things!"" for an hour and a half they made it have a purpose. They did a really good job at turning dory from comedic relief character to the main character without sacrificing the quality of the movie.

Like Finding Nemo is such a grand and epic adventure, and I felt like this one was basically just wandering around a marine reserve/theme park for an hour.

d4cjq8e,"Just got done watching it, my god what a great sequel. The beginning with young Dory was so cute and just beautifully animated.

I think this is the one movie where I wanted to see more of the secondary characters. I mean I loved them all. Hank, Destiny, Baily, hell I even loved the sea lions. I mean this movie was really great and had some of the most beautiful animation in any movie. Plus Piper at the start was great too.

Oh and that after credits scene! Just brillant, but I wish we got someof Bruce and the other sharks.

All in all go see it, you will not be disappointed. 

EDIT: God did anybody just love what they did with Marlin? I mean I love his character now, that monument to the giant squid line had me in stitches. ",4oh39s
d4g82f0,"I just saw the film, and I couldn't help noticing that Destiny and Bailey felt like two halves of the same character, like they were originally one character but were split into two at some point in production. 

One character that can't see well but then learns how to use the ""world's best pair of glasses"" (echolocation) makes much more sense than two rather disjointed characters.

Did anyone else notice this?  ",4oh39s
d4cjkbq,"I really like this movie. Although I still prefer the first on because of this couple of points:

* **Finding Nemo** had a **greater sense of adventure.** You had Marlin and Dory travelling across the entire ocean and encountering so many different characters along the way. Scenes like the jellyfish hopping, Dory learning how to read the sign when being chased by sharks, the school of fish, those were all such memorable scenes. In **Finding Dory**, sure there was some ocean travelling, but the majority of the movie took place in only one location, which was that marine park. This to me did not made me feel more engaged in the movie as in Finding Nemo, you get to feel Marlin's pain of travelling across the entire ocean for his son. I didn't get to feel any sort of stakes being raised higher with Finding Dory. This isn't really a huge complaint, just an observation of the grand scale of adventure between both movies.

* **Finding Nemo was more realistic**. Now you must be thinking, an animated movie about fish talking being realistic? What are you, crazy? When I say realistic, I mean the fishes behave the way fishes are physically allowed to. In **Finding Dory**, you had Hank the Octopus swinging from ceiling to ceiling, you had the Marlin and Nemo, sea water fishes, in a FRESH WATER fish tank, oh and who could forget that they landed in that dirty water mop bucket. I expected them to felt some discomfort a bit but nope, they were fine and dandy. Again, not another huge complaint. This didn't hinder my enjoyment out of the movie.

Now for the things I really like:

* **The Flashback Sequences**. Usually I can't stand flashbacks in movies, but I think the movie did a solid job on it. The flashbacks was paced so perfectly in the movie that it didn't feel annoying and I actually wanted more of them.

* **The new supporting cast**. I was afraid they might rehash old characters from the first movie out of laziness but nope! Mostly new characters! Each of them have such a unique personality and you can relate to so much. Also love how there really wasn't a villain in the movie, thank god Pixar didn't went down that cliche route. Not every movie needs a baddie people! I wish **Nemo** had more things to do though. He didn't really had a character arc and was mostly there to tag along.

Overall its a great 9 out of 10 from me. Love the movie.

d4ergq8,"Anyone else catch the cop mouthing the words ""what the fuck?""",4oh39s
d4dbvzg,"Anyone else feels that the movie's plot seemed a little rushed? It was a fantastic movie that I'd give an 8/10, but the plot felt like it couldn't fit into the length of the film.

The film would've been a potential 10/10 if it were given a longer run time to flesh out more plot points. Some of the things that I felt were rushed and compressed:

- Dory's parents reunion with Dory and their roles in general were pretty insignificant despite it being the overall objective of the movie

- Hank's character development also felt rather fast paced and could've been fleshed out in more detail for the audience to form a stronger sense of relation to Hank

- Marlin and Nemo didn't seemed to do much the entire time (*especially* Nemo), I wish their adventure before the ending arc were more significant to the plot 

These are just some of the points that stood out to me. I also felt that the movie didn't had as many memorable scenes compared to the first movie, and I blame it on the film being set mainly in the same location. The sense of adventure from the first movie didn't seem to be present in the sequel which is disappointing, but regardless the movie is still a good 8/10 for me because of how thrilling and emotional it can get.",4oh39s

d4esvu2,"I have a sister with a physical and mental disability, and I have a chronic disease and this movie was incredibly touching because of that. It showed that what we may consider our disadvantages or handicaps, can really be a strength to us. That for me was really special, and I think it will touch many young children with different abilities. 

Regarding what some people are saying about the supporting characters disabilities being ""gags,"" I didn't feel that way. I think one of the keys for me dealing with my health issues is finding a way to laugh at it, and be not take it too seriously. I'm not sure if this will come across to young children as such, but it was comforting for me in a way. I was like, ""Ya, I get it!""

Overall, really touching film.",4oh39s
d4gvbkw,"I thought it was just ok.  

Not a Cars 2 by any stretch but far, far from a Toy Story 2.

It was visually beautiful and the octopus was a lot of fun to watch.  But aside from that, I started tiring of the Dory character about mid-way through.  

I realized how much of Dory's charm was in the way her character played off of Marlin's agitation and neuroses.  It was a fun pairing in the original.  Dory on her own was too much for me.

My 5 year old loved it, though and it was a great Father's Day treat to watch with him -- so I can live with a mediocre movie under those circumstances.",4oh39s
d4cil1u,"Anyone spot the John Ratzenberger cameo? I believe it was the male crab trimming grass but they changed the pitch of his voice. Pretty sneaky, Pixar.",4oh39s
d4e3gs1,"Great movie. Aside from just being great, I can't get over how fucking beautiful it was. Animation has come such a long way. And the short at the beginning - I actually thought it was live action for a second because it was just that realistic. I would so love to take a time machine to when Toy Story came out and just show Pixar how far they're going to go.

And I think it'd be really interesting to do like a side-by-side comparison of the animation from both movies. Obviously they kept it stylistically similar, but there's so much more subtle detail. It's truly mind-blowing how much has changed in just 13 years. ",4oh39s

d4ipd17,"The whole film was beautiful, and I absolutely loved it. That being said, the one theme that hit home was the memory loss thing.

d4sy3f8,It felt more like a Disney movie than a Pixar movie.,4oh39s
d4ie3zu,"Finding Nemo was a great movie - a truly phenomenal work of art. Finding Dory was good. It didn't feel like a rehash of the first. It was entirely its own movie. The animation was stunning, the new characters were hilarious and interesting, and Dory finding her parents made the story come full circle. 

However...I did have to suspend belief. A lot. The original felt real - the dangers of the predatory fish, the mines, even Marlin and Dory riding in the pelican's beak. In this film, they do so many stunts that I was underwhelmed by the time Marlin and Nemo hopped across the fountain. At least they missed one of them. Still, the movie finished with a whale with X-Ray vision and an octopus (sorry, septopus) driving a semi...this movie had an entirely new reality. 

The writing also lacked in several scenes - particularly those with Marlin and Nemo and Dory's flashbacks. I hate using this word because I'm not a cynical person, but the dialogue was flat out cheesy several times throughout the film. 

Honestly, I would like this better if it were a standalone film. Viewing it within the context of the original makes it feel a bit forced. Having said that, it was a solid film. If they improved on the writing, got rid of the mentally challenged sea lion that contradicted the message of the film, maintained a decent pace, and didn't have so many implausible action sequences, it would be a much better one. I feel like someone could cut out entire scenes and that alone would make it far superior. 

I give Dory an 8/10, all things considered. Films can be so much worse, especially in animation and sequels.  ",4oh39s

d4cjc3q,"I thought the first and second act were good but not great. Some fun moments with new characters, a few good lines. Liked how crossing the ocean wasn't much of a challenge for the characters (been there, done that). Had the rest of the movie played out that way, it would have been forgettable. 

But holy cow, that third act redeemed it all. All the characters had a purpose and played off each other perfectly, and the moment the camera panned onto the lines of shells I was literally moved to tears. Like Finding Nemo, the strength was in the execution rather than the originality of story, and that's just fine with me.",4oh39s

d4odp4t,"How in the world did they get not one but TWO fully retarded characters on screen at the same time? Gary (Gerald?) and Becky were the absolute MVPs of this movie. I have not laughed to the point of tears and not breathing since Borat but Gary and Becky brought me to that level.

d4nom5b,"Unfortunately, Finding Nemo is perfect and this could probably never measure up. That being said, it's a great sequel and I had a blast. All the new characters shined tremendously and more often than not, they stole the show. The Sigourney Weaver bit was inspired Andrew Stanton style quirkiness and cracked me up each time they did it. 

But I have to say the short ran away with it. That was one of the  most beautiful things they've ever done and got me excited for what they might do in the future... maybe venture into more realistic animation with more subtle cartoony touches. ",4oh39s
d4dawk1,"I feel awful. Legit awful.  **There is nothing wrong with this movie.** It's entertaining. It's cute. It's funny.  But god damn was I whelmed.  This is officially the first Pixar movie that I'm disappointed with because it's Pixar.  I don't know if I'm in a dark place or I've just reached a saturation level of inherent grumpiness, but here I am.

The main problem is that this feels like an old school Disney sequel. The story seems flimsier. The stakes less serious because because.  The only ""wow"" factor was found in the short before the movie(Piper is just wonderful. I gasped at just the detail in the sand!). 

I think the biggest problem I had is that despite being a movie about talking fish, I was having trouble suspending my belief.  The ""climax"" felt like it belonged in a Madagascar movie, not a Pixar.  And that's the problem.  Aside from a few emotional high spots, this was just as memorable as the Penguins of Madagascar movie(which wasn't a bad movie, I'm just making a point). 

I legit love Brave and The Good Dinosaur. I give brownie points for Cars 2 because they went in an ambitious direction.  I struggle with this because I expected more Toy Story 2 and 3, not Little Mermaid 2.

d4cjer1,I thought it was phenomenal!!  It was a lot more fun than Finding Nemo for me atleast.  The new characters were great.  Especially Hank!  Baby Dory was probably the cutest thing i've ever seen in my entire life.  The only complaint I have ( and it's a very minor one) is that I think they could've found a kid that sounded more like Nemo from the first movie.  The new kid sounded too different imho.

d8316vl,"I didn't like the fact that everyone is accepted for who he is – except Hank.

The main theme of the movie is accepting oneself completely, our strengths as well as our defects, or disabilities in the case of Dory. Dory is indeed continuously reassured by her parents who never criticize her for her behavior, and Nemo does the same. The same goes for Destiny and Bailey. Everyone is accepted and encouraged with the “be yourself” mantra. This doesn’t hold true for Hank, though, perhaps more subtly. Dory welcomes him, but does not *accept* him. In fact at the end of the movie she discusses with him about his behavior, his goals, his identity, his will, effectively condemning them as “wrong” and reversing his wishes. When Hank changes his mind, when he is fixed, then, and only then, he is accepted by Dory and the community.",4oh39s

d4fk2zk,"Incredible movie. Arguably even better than Finding Nemo which was very unexpected for me. At the very least, the prison break style sequence was tighter in this movie and quite a bit larger in scale. Speaking of the human involvement in this film, it felt like they had a larger role to play without needing the one psychopatic kid as the villain. The fishes were victims of well intentioned humans and circumstance, and it felt satisfying in its own way in how the protagonists overcame.

Dory really tugged at the heartstrings with her coping with her disability, and she had quite a few sad moments that really anchored the heart of this film and it was a really nice lesson on kids/adults who live with disabilities and what potential they have even with their condition.

The theater was really rooting for this film and was clapping at the end. Very satisfying viewing experience.

d4gkvq5,"My viewing experience for Finding Dory...

I often worry about children being too rambunctious in the movie theater, but it makes me so mad when it's the adults that ruin the movie.

This woman who sat next to us yelled ""AWWW!"" and banged her hands together causing her hard plastic bracelets to click during every sentimental scene, effectively taking away any emotional impact. She also gasped and screamed ""ohhh boy!"" or ""uh oh!"" during every part that was even slightly suspenseful or tense.

She would also periodically yell out random objects that the characters were using. You know, like when one of the characters simply picked up a coffee mug she yelled ""Oh, a coffee mug!""

During parts of the movies where characters learned lessons or developed at all, she would weirdly agree with what was happening. She would bob her head furiously saying things like ""Uh! That is so true! Just be yourself!""

I would finally like to point out that this woman was not alone. She was a grandmother who was with two other adults and 3 small children. The children sat quietly for the entire two hours. Literally, did not hear a single word from them.

To this woman, I would just like to say thank you because now I will always have this terrible memory of seeing a movie that I've have waited for over 13 years to see. Hopefully, someday, we'll be lucky enough to be just like Dory and forget this whole thing happened.

Finally, there was a couple in front of us who also had a daughter of about 4 years old. The girl didn't make a sound the entire movie, but her parents sure felt obligated to stare at their phones for a solid 60 seconds 45 minutes into the movie.",4oh39s

d4civje,"Great movie! Finding Nemo is literally my favorite movie, period, but it's mainly for its visuals, quotability, and a little nostalgia sprinkled in. Finding Dory definitely still maintains a lot of that, but it trades a bit of it in for a big dose of emotion, which I think was a great trade. (EDIT - which is really weird now that I think about it because Nemo starts with a death scene but then lightens up, but Dory kind of goes the opposite direction. But overall, Dory seems like it hit harder for me. Maybe it's just bias from having JUST watched it.)

Granted, I wish I was given a little bit more about Hank's backstory, but I was actually surprised by how much MORE of the movie there was left at any given time. I kept thinking, ""oh it's almost the end, isn't it"", but new scenes kept coming.

Loved the new cast additions, and I'm glad they found a decent way to keep Nemo relevant. Also very glad that they skipped the travel-across-the-ocean process. Kinda wished that Nemo was present at the very pre-credits scene but that's alright.

Very touching, and very engaging despite my initial concerns from The Good Dinosaur being somewhat substance-lite.

Must watch!

EDIT - Also, good lord, that short at the beginning: Piper! That was one of the most adorable things I've ever seen. I want a Piper plush now.

EDIT 2 - Now that I recall, I feel like the sea lions were a bit odd, because it seemed like one of the overarching themes was to love and respect mentally-challenged individuals for the gifts that they do have in spite of what they might lack, but the one odd sea lion was kind of the butt of the joke from beginning to end.",4oh39s

I know they had a scene in the post credits, but so many people would have missed that because if nothing else at that point as a parent you have a young child who needs to use the bathroom, and who just sat still for nearly 2 hours and is ready to get out of there.  

I also feel those characters were owed more for this movie, especially Gill who had a special relationship with Nemo in the first movie.  It was sad to not see them in the main movie, and to not see them have more of a happy ending by showing that they had gotten out of the bags and were free in the ocean.  

I've read where some have said that Nemo wasn't really needed in the plot anyway.  I say that you had to have Nemo in the movie or many would have been disappointed.  What I would have done is have Marlin go with Dory and have Nemo stay home to be taken care of by Gill and the rest of the tank gang who are revealed to now live close to Nemo, Marlin, and Dory.  Then you could have had a minor subplot involving these characters back home while Marlin and Dory go on with the main plot.  ",4oh39s

Yeah, the sequel doesn't have the same organic feel in terms of storytelling (too much convenience) and sense of realism (Becky, Octopus driving a truck, they're doing okay in fresh water environment). But to me, none of that matters when I was more invested to how her memory drove the course of the story to found her parents. The way they giving clue by clue to reveal some answers keep me interested enough. I'd say if you didn't appreciate Dory as her character, you're gonna find a hard time invested to her story because it really is about her. The new characters are awesome too, but Hank really stole the show to me. But hey, some people have some issues with it and I really appreciate that. I love this movie tbh, because it had different story beats from the predecessor and felt fresher even though it wasn't the best.

d4f50pt,"I really liked the movie, but I had a pretty big problem with the characters of Becky and Gerald. So far this series has had a huge theme of accepting people for their differences and learning to work with disabilities and yet we have two characters that are basically mentally challenged animals who are being exploited by characters in the movie to get what they want and also by the filmmakers to get cheap laughs.

d4cz2lu,"I loved the movie. I had fun watching it, I don’t think there was a character I didn’t like and it was beautiful, regarding the animation, the emotion and the score. 

I’d like to address a few things that stood out to me:

First, the movie seemed to be fighting a good fight for mental illness awareness. It kind of said, “Those with mental disabilities can do everything a person without can! They can help and they can be loved and love and they can fit into society like everyone else!” Yet, Becky and the seal with the bucket (sorry, forget his name. Gerald?) were the butt of all the jokes. I think they handled Marlin’s guilt wonderfully though, and Dory’s parents were amazing, when it came to dealing with her issue. I just have mixed feelings on it. I’m not offended by it, I just like thinking about it, but I can see others being upset by it.

Second, everything just kind of falls together at the end. It’s great, because I was fearing something really sad happening to someone, but watching the movie as an adult, it just doesn’t feel satisfying. And, I was a little bothered by everything surviving in fresh water lol.

Third, and this is just silly, the movie comes really close to having some psychological thriller/horror undertones with Dory’s flashbacks. I just want a cut of “Finding Dory, if it was a horror movie” but I don’t have that kind of software.

Fourth, dammit, I didn’t know there was an after credits scene. As we were leaving, my friend and I joked, “Will they put, “Dory will return for Avengers: Infinity War”? Jokes on us.

Like I said, I loved it. It had its flaws, and I can’t say it’s better than the original but I also don’t think it’s worse. ",4oh39s
d4dvc8j,"Maybe this is going out on a limb here, maybe not.  But I actually enjoyed it more than the first.  I enjoyed the characters (and the larger cast in general) more than those in Nemo, and the message behind it felt more accessible/relatable than the first film.  

Not that I have anything against Finding Nemo, it's a great film.  I just think this one reached out to audiences in a way the first one didn't.  Then again, I may be biased, because I saw it with a friend who, at 23, just got hearing aids last week, and this was her first movie since getting them.  

Her reactions, both to actually hearing a movie properly for the first time, and the message from the characters in the film, had her in full-on tears by the end.  It was a special moment to be there for.  Anyways, I'm getting off topic.

Edit: Also, I'm really excited about Idris Elba's apparently rising career as a voice actor.  He stands out so much as a presence, that you know it's him from the first word his characters speak.  I just love the depth and inflections that he puts into his voice acting work.  I actually like it more than having him on screen, honestly.  This may be his niche going forward, and I say more power to you, Mr. Elba.  

Objectively, 8/10

With emotional context, 9/10",4oh39s
d4frgbw,"I had low expectations for this film going in and now I can say I'm very pleased with the results. I was worried this film would retread too much of the original or basically remake the same movie with some tweaks (looking at you, TFA). On the surface it's similar but this film is different enough. It's not as good as the original but it's a highly enjoyable film. It's better than a number of recent Pixar films, only behind Inside Out and Toy Story 3 which could be argued as being masterpieces. This feels like a Pixar film throughout. If there's one thing the film excelled at besides animation is Dory's character development. Dory is the most interesting and memorable character of Finding Nemo so exploring her character from her point of view was a good choice. I was worried that having an extremely forgettable character lead a film could get old fast but I feel Pixar managed to succeed. It felt so satisfying to see Dory feel empowered by the end. 

But I think what is a strength for the film is also a weakness, that it is Dory's story. Marlin and Nemo don't do much at all. They are shown a lot but besides just being there and supporting Dory, they have little role in the film. I would've like to see Nemo be trusted with doing his own thing to help Dory and shown more that he too has grown as a character. He is with his father for nearly all of the scenes, when the first film was about him growing up. There is a parenting story that drives both films, and its in this one as well: that at some point kids must grow up and find the confidence that they can deal with whatever life throws at them. Dory is a reactionary character as opposed to the more logical Marlin and the film conveys this very well. This also makes it more interesting to watch Dory tackle situations, even if the flashbacks seem a bit too convenient at times. 

Some of the scenes in the film are over the top, even for Pixar standards, but if you can suspend your disbelief for a bit, the slow mo with the truck flying off into the water is amazing. I had some issues with the Octopus baby scene and the fact that they stole and could actually drive the truck down a highway. One of the things I find admirable about Pixar films are that the adults aren't stupid and that the stories feel like they could take place in our world. Having Hank be within sight of humans for a large portion of the film starts to lose that feel. But it didn't really hurt my enjoyment of the film overall. I was wondering how they'd top the Airport scene in Toy Story 2 and ultimately I think they did.

9/10. A pretty good sequel overall. Could have been stronger but Dory's journey is very well done. 

Some thoughts: 

I feel that the film got much better as it went on. I don't think the earlier half was as engrossing for some reason.

Hank was a great character and I loved seeing him warm up to Dory, and eventually the idea of not being alone.

I adored the scene with the hands poking the sea creatures and the terror that goes on there. It reminds me like the daycare scene in Toy Story 3 except we actually get to see the reactions. 

I would've like to have seen more of the otters. They have a pretty substantial role when you think about it, but they just decide to help Dory for whatever reason. At least in Toy Story 3, when the aliens appeared at the end you knew why and their motivations. 

I personally think one of the best (if not the best) scene in the movie is where Dory is told her parents are gone, then from her POV we see her ending up the in drain and ending up alone. That whole sequence is a mix of emotions. It's exhilarating and frightening at the same time. It puts Dory at the lowest point we've seen her character. 

I miss the feeling of exploration and seeing breathtaking shots like the original had. Just beautiful shots of the ocean filled with so much life. I feel like the film could've slowed down and shown us more of the ocean. The story is always moving toward the plot, which can be a good thing, but the setting and scenery were a huge part of the original.

I was unsure of all of the weird characters at first but I loved how everything came together in the end. Similarly I loved how some of the seemingly random things Dory said like Octopus having 3 hearts or about the glasses had an explanation. 

The post-credits scene doesn't make that much sense but it's still hilarious. ",4oh39s

d4glrhv,"I thought it was a solid enough movie. Being linked to the amazing Nemo works against it because its hard enough to make one movie that good, let alone two. Doubly difficult when Dory played quite a significant role in nemo, which made character development a little more challenging. 

The disability element of the movie I thought was incredibly valuable and powerful and hope it has an impact on kids and adults alike. The title lived up to its billing... Dory was finding herself. She achieved and didn't let her disability stop her. She learned to cope. There was no magical cure. The work she and her parents put in ultimately paid off.

My favorite part of the movie, hands down, was when Dory runs into Marlin for the first time.

When I heard that same music in the new movie, it really hit home and I felt like a scared little kid again.",4oh39s
d4fxp1q,"The amount of deus ex machina in this movie blows away anything else I've ever seen. The plot has so many holes it can barely hold fish, let alone water.

They actually had to resort to an echolocation whale that just psychically sees things then shouts important plot information into the air, whereby Dory/Marlin magically hears it no matter how far away they are (and regardless of whether they're near any pipes) and knows what to do next.

Most movies involve some amount of suspension of disbelief, even if it's as basic as buying into everyone hearing what everyone else says perfectly on the first try for two straight hours.

But this was a whole other level. An octopus driving a semi? Nothing in *Finding Nemo* even approached this film's level of *deus ex acqua*.

In spite of all this I did start crying when we finally find Dory's parents and they've forlornly laid out trails of shells in the hopes of bringing her home. I will also concede that I did laugh every single time Destiny hit a wall.

----

Footnote: while we're on the subject of suspension of disbelief, anyone who's ever kept fish knows they die at the drop of a pin. Am I **really** supposed to believe that all those tanks, buckets, and separate bodies of water had the same pH and temperature? PLEASE. The octopus driving a truck is plausible by comparison. All the main characters should have been dead within minutes. Thanks obama.

d4cl84i,"This is going to be the absolute minority and I'm probably going to be downvoted to hell, but fuck it. I didn't like it. My wife and I didn't like it. Everyone else in the theater seemed to. We couldn't and the reasons are long and numerous.

It starts with the worst sequel trope, which is retreading old ground. Every scene for the first ten minutes is a retread of Finding Nemo and every joke is simply lazy. Mr. Ray with his long hooting voice that won't quit, them seeing something crazy at the reef and someone getting swept away, overprotective parents of a young disabled fish. It all felt very contrived, and I'm going to be coming back to that word a lot. None of this movie felt natural or free form in the least, but almost like a sequel created by a committee hoping to recreate the spark of the original. 

Let's move on to the characters. The secondary characters were not memorable, and were all pretty one note. I hate comparing sequels to their predecessors, but Finding Nemo does everything so right that it's hard not to compare. Every character in this helped them for seemingly no reason, and had little agency of their own. The octopus helps Dory because he wants the tag. Ok, but he is established to hate pretty much everything but himself, why can't he just take it from her? Because they needed a reason for her to be helped. Why do the sea lions help Nemo and Marlin? Even Marlin says that they're dangerous and eat fish! But no, they help them out, go out of their way for basically no reason. The otters at the end were the worst. They just magically plop down in front of these otters and suddenly their jumping onto a crowded free way into incoming traffic? What purpose would they have for doing this? And don't tell me this is just a kids movie. This is Pixar and they deserve to be held to a higher standard.

The major secondary characters were not memorable and were afforded little personality other than physical characteristics. The whale shark is near sighted and she knows Dory from a long time ago. That's it. The beluga whale can't do sonar, and then it can. That's it. Now this is running kind of long but I have to get this off my chest so I'll piggy back it in another comment.",4oh39s
d4h8c4l,"Thought it was really bad to be honest. Finding Nemo at least felt real and natural to me. I bought the world they sold. This one just didn't make sense. They were constantly out of water and swimming faster than the speed of light, etc. When the climax of your movie is an octopus driving a truck, you know you've lost all reputability. So many of the set pieces were just boring. I wanted to see more of that sunken tanker but it only ended up being a boring chase scene and that's it. Boring hallways and stuff aren't what Pixar should be using animation for yet thats the majority of the film.

Plus, I just didn't like how they tried to make us want to see Nemo and Marlin go help Dory because she helped them yet they get lost immediately after and do nothing except comic relief and cliche ""oh no she was our friend and you said something mean to her!"" I mean this writing felt like it should have been on the Disney Channel or something.

I also thought it was dumb how they couldn't even stick to Dory's problem. One second her memory can't hold a conversation for five seconds. Another she can talk for minutes at a time. Just didn't feel real at all.

Pixar is definitely not the same company that set out to make good movies. Now they solely make kid's movies. It's a shame. ",4oh39s
d4cinlw,"I think this is a great sequel to Finding Nemo. It was lighter than Finding Nemo but it still has some well executed touchy-feely moment.

I like the additions of the new characters. I really enjoyed Bailey and Destiny's banter. I also like Hank the Septapus and Some of the Hank and Dory scenes were good and their characters are great in fleshing each other's vulnerability.

Marlin and Nemo have to go back to their backseat in this movie but both of them has their little character arc. Rudder and Fluke also provides some funny dialogue and interaction even though they had limited screen time compare to the other character.

As a sequel, I think it is was not better than Toy Story 2 & 3 but it was two steps better than Monster University and miles better than Cars 2. I would put this as one of the great Pixar sequels like Toy Story 2 and 3. I put Monsters University in the good pixar sequel and Cars 2 in subpar Pixar sequel.

In the end as a Disney Shill I would say if you and your family are looking for a good movie sequel for family to enjoy after Captain America: Civil War, then this movie is perfect for it.

It can't match the heights of ""Nemo"", though. There's a real lack of scale/adventure in comparison to the first one.

I'm questioning the choice to make Dory the main star of the sequel. The fundamentals of her character disallow her from much of an emotional journey. I also found her to be much less grating as a comic relief foil than as a main character.

I have my complaints but most are very minor - my one big complaint though is one that's been mentioned in the thread multiple times already but I feel like sharing my own perspective on.

I'm not a very PC person, but the fact that the sea lion and the bird (Gerald and Becky respectively) were basically portrayed as mentally ill or to be more blunt retarded characters - qualities which would often be exploited for laughs - bothered me. Dory's short-term memory loss is handled in a really good way in my opinion. It gives her personality and is a central part of her character and allows for lighthearted, funny moments and more heartbreaking and unfortunate ones too. It gives a holistic and purposeful treatment of her condition in a way that's organic, child-friendly, mature, and respectful. But Gerald and Becky were just ""Look at these dumb animals that are stupid and silly!"" No respect, immature, and ultimately in bad taste in my opinion. I dunno, just rubbed me the wrong way I guess. I didn't hate it, just didn't sit right with me.

I wish they gave the reason the octopus was so scared of going back to the ocean. If they gave him a backstory and told us how he lost his tentacle (I doubt it was in the garbage disposal), or even why he dislikes children so much, it would have given us as the audience a reason to root for him to overcome his past fears when he gets back to the ocean.

2) scene reuse?: when she asks those little fuzzy balls for help and they disappear into their little holes and come back out when she leaves; I think there's a similar scene in The Little Mermaid opening credits (not asking for help, just the little fuzzballs popping in and back out of their holes).  
3) it was sad and happy at the same time, to see all the little connections come together (where dory knew how to speak whale, all the little facts she knew that seemed random, etc), and ***especially*** the scene with her family.

d63dmei,"Fantastic movie! It's been years since I've seen the original, but I feel like this one was even better. The humor was hilarious, the visuals were beautiful, and it was actually really emotional in several parts. I got so sad seeing how Dory's life was affected by her condition. She basically has her entire existence reset every few moments, finds herself in terrifying situations without any idea of how or why she's there. That's really depressing.

I really hope Zootopia snags the Oscar this year instead of Finding Dory.",4oh39s
d4l8swi,I think the short film Piper was more entertaining. Finding Dory was too much of a hack. I was expecting Hank to be more of a villain like Bruce the Shark was. 6/10,4oh39s
d4g8oq2,"It was good, I liked it, but it felt more like an early 2000s Disney straight-to-DVD sequel then it did a full on sequel. *Finding Nemo* had this grandiose adventure feel to it that *Finding Dory* just lacked. The fact that Dory's search for her parents took just over a day really negated any real tension or mystery the movie might have had. Not to mention that Marlin and Nemo were just sort of there because they had to be. 

It wasn't a bad movie by any means. It was better than *Cars 2* by a longshot, and I would say I generally enjoyed it more than *Monsters University*. But it's yet another sequel from Pixar that feels more like a cash grab than a true sequel. *Cars 2* opened the floodgates, and it seems like no other franchise can quite get the *Toy Story* treatment. ",4oh39s
d4cjjqn,"I haven't seen Nemo in a while, but fresh out of seeing this I'm honestly feeling like it was even a touch better, if not at least a very worthy successor. I was very worried at the start that it'd basically be the same movie all over again, but they kept all the callbacks classy while having a new interesting premise/plot and developing the characters even more.

All the fun goofy humor was there, but what I liked was the mature dark humor subtly sprinkled here and there mostly used to further develop the theme of overcoming handicaps and not letting anything hold you back. 

It was crazy to me that from the very beginning they were gonna evolve Dory's memory loss from a recurring joke to a real exploration of mental illness, but I thought they handled it  about as well as you can in a kid's movie (okay, not as well as Inside Out,  but they had to stay true to the Nemoverse and be a little lighter and funnier).",4oh39s
d4cproe,"The good: the callbacks to the original weren't excessive, the new characters were funny (especially Destiny and the random clam), and our familiarity with the main characters helped with some of the jokes and the emotional beats. Yes, there are moments, happy and sad, where you might tear up.

Criticisms: lot of the humor is slapstick based, which I felt was less funny than the dialogue, and the film probably could have slowed down at times to allow us to better appreciate more emotional scenes. If I'm going to be super nitpicky, the ending credit song seemed like an odd choice.

Overall, it's a good film, even if it's not as good as Finding Nemo. Sometimes a little too zany for my taste, but it has plenty of heart and laugh out loud moments. Oh, and baby Dory might be the cutest thing ever.",4oh39s
d4exkqw,"Seems like any comment in here saying this movie was a disappointment is downvoted, but seriously? It comes no where near to the quality of the first one. It was enjoyable as a movie, but the story felt forced and cobbled together and the new characters were deadset boring and generic. 

And did Nemo and Marlin play any significant role in the movie? Or did they just tag along because they had to be there. 

Seriously after one of my favourite movies all time as a kid, this didn't nearly live up to the hype of the past few years. ",4oh39s
d4ht7my,"It wasn't necessarily terrible but i do have to wonder what the heck is going in the persons mind who wrote this. ""Finding Nemo:Let's take a story about the ocean, research the crap out of it so the people watching it can learn things and let's make it crazy deep and emotional so people feel things. Finding Dory: I don't know let make another story about fish and stuff. We don't even need to be accurate about them we will just make up whatever. And lets make is so completely unbelievable. Oo! I would love to see a fish drive a truck lol. Lastly we will throw in some shit about family or something to make the parent happy. And cute things gotta have cute things.""

My main things about this movie that annoyed me were


1.It felt alot like Cars 2. Didn't like Cars 2.

2. Pixar is usually so good at handling emotional things and the trauma that the characters are going through but apparently since Dory has memory loss she doesn't actually feel very much.

3. The characters from the first movie should have had way more screen time. And the fact that the characters from the first one that did show up didn't have anything to actually say was really annoying. The only one that kind of helped was crush who they miraculously found out of nowhere.

4. The whale speak was way too annoying and also didn't make sense since she talked to Destiny in her normal voice most of the time.

5. I don't think an aquarium would every have a shark and a whale in a place where they could just jump over the wall to the ocean.",4oh39s
d4civhk,"I've seen the original Finding Nemo over 400 times (not an exaggeration) and it still keeps me as engaged as the first time I watched it. Finding Dory however, while good simply doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor. The emotional elements of Finding Dory are great, but there are some action sequences I felt to be over the top, I wasn't as engaged with the new characters as I was with some of the supporting characters in Nemo (The tank gang comes to mind) and I feel some of the characters regressed from where they were in Nemo to now (Marlin was more like he was during Finding Nemo, not as he was at the end.)",4oh39s
d4dsnln,"I was a bit foolish to have such high expectations.
It's my fault for expecting a sequel movie to be better than the original. The flashbacks kind of ruined the flow of the film. ""This is significant because of this new memory we are about to present to you."" I enjoyed the new characters but I would've enjoyed it more to see the old characters. Hank is awesome in his own way with his action and camouflage. There were many chances to give Hank more depth to his character to satisfy the character developement at the end. maybe even explain further why he wants to be alone and what exactly was it he was afraid of. or at least show him panicking to further prove the mental illness he had.

 Sadly, I wanted the Tank Gang to be more involved with this story.
They left so many questions unanswered.

Visually it's brilliant. The scene showing Milky Way is so beautiful and the Open Ocean aquarium is really amazing.

Pixar REALLY dropped the ball with the character ""Becky"" the loon!
Loons do not travel in flocks. 
Nor do they float on top of the water line like a duck. 
Worst of all, loons never land on the ground. In fact the only time they do come onto dry ground is to nest. Even then, they come ashore from the water.

For the first time in a while with Disney/Pixar, I was reminded throughout the film that this is a children's movie rather than being immersed in the experience and feeling like a kid myself. I can deal with the childish jokes sprinkled throughout (no problem there), but the abrupt cheesy ending just didn't do it for me.

In my humble and unprofessional opinion, they should've taken out the entire ending after the group of Blue Tangs told Dory that her parents didn't return to the main exhibit. Flesh out a better ending other than having a hastened reunion with a silly subplot where Hank has to drive the truck back to the sea and we could've had an all star of a sequel.

Maybe have Marlin, Nemo, and Dory start their journey back to the reef in despair when they suddenly find trails of shells stretching in every direction? I would imagine since Dory's parents had a full year to do this, it would be entirely plausible. Maybe cut back to the scene when Dory was first separated and then show how her parents feigned sickness to get to the medical bay and then their escape to get into the ocean and eventual trust in their daughter to return.

So many interesting things that could've made this movie more satisfying, but still...pretty happy with the return of a great franchise.

if there's a third one that bitch better be called FINDING GERALD he was the breakout star of the movie

edit: also the animation in the piper short was unreal! definitely their cutest short years",4oh39s
d4jg45y,"I did enjoy Dory's character development and progression. I thought the beginning of the movie was great, I was impressed at how well Dory worked great as a main character, and I thought the premise of the movie was very nice for a sequel. However, I was frustrated watching the rest of the movie get choppy and over-packed.
I thought it had so much more potential that was wasted. Based on [Pixar's own storytelling rules](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5916970/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar) I was surprised to see such a cluttered movie. Based on these rules (and others) here are some complaints and ""fixes"" I came up with:

Nemo could have easily been left at home at the reef. It would have made much more sense, and it's not like he's a super interesting character, nor crucial to this plot in any way. Marlin would be hesitant to leave him alone by himself, but they could have a dad/son moment before Marlin swallows his fears and leaves on another adventure.

They got to California too fast for the pacing of the movie. This could have easily been remedied by a montage (with some music) of Marlin and Dory leaving on an adventure together, and traveling across the sea, with shots of Dory looking peppy and determined, and Marlin looking hesitant and worried about having left Nemo alone. Then, they should have been *exhausted* when they finally arrive in CA. When the bioluminescent squid attacks them Marlin should have been like ""Dory! Why did I let you drag me here?! Nemo is all alone, etc.""

Marlin, now without Nemo in my dream scenario, is left in the bay alone with the seals after Dory is collected. Maybe the seals and some other animals (otters, fish, turtles) in the bay are also waiting for their loved ones to be released, only to later discover they are scheduled to be shipped to Cleveland on the truck (which would also give more of a reason for the otters to be willing to jump into the middle of the road if their friends were on it).Then Marlin bands together with some of them or something, or maybe Marlin is the only one small enough to fit into a pipe and infiltrate the quarantine room (Nemo callback!). It gives Marlin something more important and more interesting to do (as the movie is, it seemed like the writers just sort of came up with something for Marlin and Nemo to do while Dory went on her adventure). When the truck empties the fish into the bay, the fish all reunite with their families. 

Bailey and Destiny did not need to be in the movie at all, or at the very least should have been combined into one character. Dory and Hank needed *just* a few more onscreen moments together, and Destiny & Bailey only detracted from that. I also hated that they could so easily jump out of their tanks and into the sea, and decided to do it so hastily, and with such a tacked-on motivation. The only way they served the plot at all was Bailey's echolocation (and to a lesser degree, explaining Dory’s ability to speak whale). If the plot really needed that, there could have been a whale in the bay with Marlin (re: my dream scenario above) or Destiny & Bailey should have been combined into one whale character. I also thought they were ANNOYING. The whale-speak got old fast, and Bailey’s echolocation scream did as well. Also why did Destiny speak whale? She’s a whale SHARK, not a whale.  



As far as things being too unrealistic: 

Marlin and Nemo jumping all over the park was frustrating and chaotic. Hank traveling all over the place worked okay, though, I thought. Pacific octpuses are known for escaping aquariums, and the entire park staff was searching for him, so I thought it became just realistic enough. 

I was okay with Hank stealing the truck. He didn't know how to drive it, which was realistic enough for me. If he had been like ""Let's ride"" and put on a pair of sunglasses from the glove compartment, I would be in the ""Too Unrealistic"" camp. But, he was fidgeting with all the buttons, couldn't see out the windshield, a terrible driver, and I was able to suspend my disbelief. 

I was willing to believe that the water in the aquarium with the toy fish was saltwater. There was nothing indicating that it was any particular type of water, other than assumption. I told myself that it had been scooped out of the bay. As for the mop bucket, they were only in it for a brief moment, but I still think they should have gotten dizzy or at least coughed or something.

From a bird lover's (and nitpicker's) point of view, I thought Becky should have been a different species, since [loons can't really walk on land that well and rarely leave the water](http://www.loon.org/day-loon.php) . A Canadian goose would have worked fine. Not a legitimate complaint about the movie, just a little something that stuck out to me. 

EDIT: Rearranged some paragraphs and added the bit about the freshwater.",4oh39s

There are times in the story where corporate interests take over before relinquishing control to the creatives. A number of check-boxes can be seen being ticked off before the end.

d4d6vnt,"Finding Dory - 4/5

Dory will give you an ocean of laughter, even if the plot can be a little light weight.

The movie takes place directly after Finding Nemo, even though Finding Nemo came out 13 years ago. You don't need to watch Nemo, and if you have but barely remember it, Finding Dory does a good enough job at making references to remind you of past characters and events.

The jokes are well spread out throughout the movie to keep you entertained with the Pixar brand of good and sometimes witty humor, sprinkled with some jokes for the adults.

The movie is largely an adventure movie, so most of what you see are the characters getting from point to point, but there are some character-driven moments, which leads to a few touching moments and an inspirational message that you don't hear too often.

The story begins to rush through after two-thirds of the movie, likely because the minds behind the movie realize kids start to get restless at about the hour mark. While it can be understood, it affects the story-telling experience for adults and young adults.

There are also a couple of scenes are pretty ridiculous, especially for Disney/Pixar's standards. Personally, it took me out of the movie due to the sheer absurdity, although people still did laugh at it.

Not a point I will deduct a point for, but while Zootopia was a very serious message about discrimination and stereotyping, Finding Dory's message about disabilities is hit or miss. While Dory's plight can hit the right notes of comedy and sadness, the supporting characters' issues felt like throwaway gags that didn't help to push the subplot of understanding and dealing with various disabilities, mental or physical

Overall it's a worthy sequel to one of Pixar's great hits. It is lighter in plot compared to PG rated animated movies like Zootopia, Toy Story and Shrek so it's not as rewatchable, but still very entertaining.

The short film attached is super adorable, and the movie also has a post-credits scene.",4oh39s

d4fowoh,"Oh boy.  I'll probably get slammed for this but....  I hated it.  HATED it.  A complete letdown.  And for the record I love love LOVE pixar.  Inside Out was fantastic, never mind The Incredibles, Wall-E, all 3 Toy Stories, heck even though Cars 1 and 2 weren't cinematic masterpieces, I still enjoyed them.  Certainly Finding Nemo was great, full of original jokes and concepts.  But this one?

How do I hate Finding Dory?  Let me count the ways.  The jokes were almost all just kiddy style slapstick, absolutely catering heavily to the lowest common denominator.  I don't mind a bit of pratfalls and stuff, but come on, this is Pixar here, throw in some good funny dialog already! I mean, was there even a single inside joke for the adults in the audience?  

Also, Dory got seriously annoying after about 10 minutes.  *Seriously* annoying.  Every single problem she got into was totally her own fault, for being idiotically impulsive and refusing to listen to advice from anybody else, even for a split second.  ""Oh Dory's so good at getting out of scrapes, what would Dory do?""  She'd have a completely ridiculous deus ex machina come along and save her from certain death about 17 times in a row, that's what she'd do.  Then she'd start talking incessantly until she fucked *that* up, then guess what, here comes D.E.M. #18 to save the day yet again.  Of course 75 sea otters will randomly step into *oncoming traffic* to help a *total stranger* of a *different species* literally *15 seconds* after meeting them, *without even being told what to do!*  Of course a 1 1/2"" fish can do a shitty bird call to an empty sky for like 5 seconds and, oh look, here's our totally convenient flying taxi service, from a fish eating carnivore no less!  Of course fishes from the saltwater ocean can survive in tap water for even a minute, never mind mop buckets filled with bleach, ammonia, and other various incredibly gill searing toxic cleaning products.  And why would a fish dream about socket wrenches?  They couldn't be bothered to come up with subconscious dream babbling that was even vaguely oceanic?  Why did the whale shark (whale SHARK by the way, not WHALE) talk in a normal voice to her neighbor, but in ""whale talk"" to Dory?  WHY?  It all made zero sense!  I was just cringing through an hour and a half of lazy, lazy writing.  

Also,was it just me, or did all those flashbacks and OH MY LOVE FOR MY VAGUELY REMEMBERED PARENTS WILL SAVE THE DAY, LOOK HOW CUTE I AM, <EMOTIONAL REACTION HERE> stuff start to get just a teensy bit cloying and overblown about halfway through?  Never mind by the end?  I mean, I'm not inhuman, I too had to wipe my eyes a bit at the end of Toy Story 3, like any other normal person.  I'm not a monster.  But jesus, do you have to keep bashing me over the head with the emotional message non frikkin stop for the full hour and a half already?  I get it, she misses her family!  Sheesh.

I have to admit, was a little worried the movie was actually OK and I was just being curmudgeonly - certainly everyone else in the theater seemed to enjoy it.  I mean, the friend I saw it with agreed 1000% with me, and he didn't even notice or care about the scientific plot holes like sea fish surviving in fresh water etc etc   On the other hand, 99% of every redditor ever seems too love it as much as i hated it, if not more so.  So I guess it's just me, the friend I saw it with, and [that one other redditor and his wife who said it better than i did](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4oh39s/official_discussion_finding_dory_spoilers/d4cl84i?sort=top) who are the only emotion free shells-of-human-beings who didn't get all teary eyed at Finding frikkin Dory?

Honestly, I'd give it a hearty 1 out of 10 - I felt like it was just that awful.  It's, maybe, the worst movie I've seen in a decade?  I've seen direct-to-DVD schlock I thought was better than this.  It anti-entertained me.  I left the theater feeling a heady mixture of anger mixed with severe disappointment, combined with a stong wish I hadn't blown $20 on the experience.  And just for the record, generally speaking, if I don't have anything good to say about a movie, I usually just shut up about it, ""It was fine i guess.""  I'm not one of those people that enjoys going around shitting on every film that doesn't suit me.  But I just *completely despised* this one - I really can't say enough bad things about this film.  I mean, I just can't not vent!  God forbid pixar keeps making more schlock like this!

The backgrounds looked good I guess.

in 1999's *the muse* (written, directed by, and starring albert brooks), brooks plays a screenwriter who is inspired by a muse to write a hit movie. his script is a big summer comedy that takes place in a california aquarium and involves sick fish. so we can congratulate pixar on another home run, but we know they had a little help.

d4e0avq,"I loved Finding Nemo, one of my favorite Pixar films. So, obviously I wen into Finding Dory with high expectations and I was a little disappointed. That being said, Finding Dory is a great film. It's funny when it should be and serious at the right times. Some of the emotional topics covered, however seemed a bit too mature for the little kid audience that you would expect this sort of movie to be aimed at (i.e parents dying). The movie also seemed very rushed near the end. 
I did however, love Hank's story line. I feel like his story line was especially great because it teaches kids that it's okay to step out of your comfort zone even though it might seem scary. By far, Hank was the best part of the film. 
Overall: 7.5/10",4oh39s
d4crf1a,"Review By Swipet

Pros:

* Great Story

* Characters were amazing

* Art and animation was very high quality. Of course Pixar is gonna do a amazing job. 

Cons:

* I loved the fact that Finding Nemo bounced around from place to place and it bothered me that the last half of the movie was at this wildlife sanctuary. It did not feel very adventurous when all the traveling they did was condensed into a 5 minuites.

* The subliminal stuff in the movie like the environmental devation, the plastic floating in the ocean, and the lesbian thing that the media made a big deal out of but did not do anything movie wise pulled me out of the immersion. Pixar is known for that creating that fantasy land that you would describe to your kids as you were reading them a nighttime story. But for this movie they also added extra pieces that was put there not for story purposes but for political reasons specifically for the adults in the audience. 

Rating: 7/10

It didn't live up to finding Nemo but it was good enough in its own right. Just like Jurasic Park is to Jurasic World. Not as good as the original but you would definitely watch it after the first one.  

Edit: Apparently got some downvoters. It's my own opinion on the movie and you have your own. At least leave a reply saying why you disagree. ",4oh39s
d4cizs1,"I thought Finding Dory was just a bit okay?

Not as good as Nemo, a lot sadder. Those flashbacks of Baby Dory kept getting to me, and the intro of her losing her folks put me in tears.

But by the end, the once funny short term memory which turned into a PTSD inducing nightmare kept causing more and more issues. Once they got back to Quarantine, I got a bit annoyed how everything kept still going wrong despite trying to hard. It felt repetitive and like the movie didn't want to end.

Also, the truck driving scene felt too ridiculous for me. 

But I loved Hank. I loved the sea lions. And I loved Baby Dory.

This movie is about Dory and I liked how Disney/Pixar went into a direction that won't repeat from the first one, like going through the ocean because to me, if that really happened in the movie, i would've just thought to myself, ""oh i guess pixar went with the same plot/setting as the first,"" which would've bored me a little that pixar writers couldn't come up with a different approach. In a way to me, both movies had great sense of adventure in their own way.

d4nofwa,"Naw, it's not you. The movie was great, but unfortunately the Pixar bar is set somewhere around ""perfect"" and the screenplay for Finding Nemo is about as perfect as they come. It has everything Dory has with a laser-beam of personal truth guiding it.

Marlin losing Nemo is literally the worst thing that could happen to him. Dory's story just didn't have that same focus or charge. It was exciting, fun and engaging... but it doesn't have the same impact because the worst is behind her already. Being a lost little kid in the ocean is the worst thing that happens to her. If she didn't find her parents or if they were dead, it would have been very very sad... but it loses impact because she would have lost them already... and she still has Marlin and Nemo, who are her family now (like the movie shows us). Whereas if Marlin lost Nemo in the first movie, he would have had nothing, and there would have been no coming back.

And yeah, the octupus driving the truck was fun... but it was a strain on disbelief that the original never asked of you. Ultimately, you accept it because it's well done and it's a cartoon, but I found it a bit jarring at first too.

This doesn't make the movie bad by any means, it's just the victim of comparison. Nemo is an 11/10; Dory is a solid 8 or 9.

To me, this movie felt like classic Pixar like the kind of movie they would have made in the early days except with better animation.

Dory as a character is fundamentally annoying when placed centrally, and Marlin and Nemo were sidelined and barely made any impact at all. The emotional moments felt strained. I didn't get Hank's motivation much at all, or the motivations of any of the other aquarium fish. Did they want to escape? It seemed with the kiddy pool bit they were hinting that it was like a fish prison, but this wasn't ever really firmly established.

d9nfzpf,"I don't think it's like that.

Of course, I agree with the movie being about accepting oneself with strengths, disabilities and defects, but I don't think that's the case for Hank.

From what I got, he is afraid of the ocean because of bad experiences and wants to withdraw in a lone glass box. To me, that's no disability, it's an anxiety disorder, which shouldn't be accepted. Also I don't think that this is the true essence of Hank, because his goals are just driven by fear.

He wants to give in to the urge to get away from what he fears, but that's not what you do with anxiety. You deal with it by fighting it and confront the fear.

Hence, when Dory encourages him to come to the ocean with her, she is just enabling him to fight his fears in a way that's only beneficial for Hank. I do think, that Dory already accepts him as who he truly is.

So, when thinking about it like that, for me, it makes the scene even better in multiple ways. That's at least my interpretation and thoughts coming from experience with depression and anxiety.",4oh39s

d5e5l05,"Pixar's modus operandi nowadays. Make the most barebones plot you can in order to justify the movie happening (keyword here being PLOT. The plot in Inside Out was not ""your emotions do wacky stuff"", it's ""Joy and Sadness get lost and have to come back home"". Barebones.) Add in a sprinkling of good comedy, very by-the-numbers action (Toy Story 3 non-withstanding, every other movie so far has had ""wacky situation that requires our characters to move fast and the soundtrack to be a very fast one"" as the basic action scene template), and some moment that is obviously meant to tug at your heartstrings.

It ain't Zootopia. And Pixar is not Walt Disney Animation Studios. Which is really bad, because it means Pixar is the one making average, passable movies now.

But Finding Dory was better than most of the latest ones we've got. I'd say even tho the actual theme of the movie isn't as creative as the Inside Out one, at least the plot has a little bit more going on, and what happens follows a tighter logic sequence than Inside Out or The Good Dinosaur. Things actually happen for a reason and not just because ""oh look at that thing in the horizon, let's go there"".

And it helps that the climax is fantastic. It's a carbon copy of the Toy Story 2 climax, to be certain, but it's well done and has a lot more going on than the average Pixar action scene of the last five years.

So I guess what I am saying is: Finding Dory tries. It's more than I can say for a lot of the latest Pixar movies. It might be a sequel, but I think it's on par with Inside Out and does a lot of things better than that movie.

And my conclusion is that Pixar just doesn't really have it anymore. Again, kudos to them for coming up with the world of Inside Out... but they didn't do anything with it. It was just another story of characters trying to go back home. It's the exact same story of The Good Dinosaur, too. And Toy Story 2. And Toy Story 3. And Brave.

Zootopia was better. Walt Disney Studios *is* better. Let's hope they go all out with Incredibles 2.

Cause I'd hate to say ""it was good but nothing special"" when I eventually watch that one.",4oh39s
d4cu3k0,"Definitely way funnier. I rewatched Nemo last week and still love it but that's because for a lot of it you're on the edge of your seat. Finding Dory didn't feel as high stakes, even with serious moments, and just felt like a ton of hilarious fun. Loved it!",4oh39s
d4ddmnj,"I don't think it was meant to make it seem like Becky and the seal with the bucket had a mental illness. They were just weird characters. Maybe the seal was a little dim-witted when compared to the other two, but for all we know Becky was the norm for all the birds since we only saw one.",4oh39s
d4dgkjb,"The seal gets his spot in the end, and Becky was instrumental in helping out the main characters. I didn't see a problem tbqh. (And in fact, when one of the main characters believes Becky isn't up to the task, they actually get into more trouble.)",4oh39s
d4evuj2,"In both movies, birds are generally portrayed as not very clever (except for the pelican guy in the first one). Don't think it was just Becky. Also with Becky, she seemed to always know what to do in the long run, she just didn't do it as quickly as Marlin would like. ",4oh39s
d4e3m6l,"The message I got wasn't about mental illness. In a more general sense, it's about overcoming obstacles (which Dory's mental illness definitely is) and the different ways to do that. For Dory her memory loss which is a burden sometimes is ultimately what allows her to succeed when all the other characters would have struggled with the same problem. It's about taking your weakness and turning into a strength.",4oh39s
d4eqf6w,"Second to Idris,

For example: Commandant, Chief Bogo, Shere Kahn, and Fluke are all wildly different characters but Idris makes each and every performance unique with the only similarity being that he voiced (or acted as in Beasts of No Nation) all of them.

He's very quickly become one of my favorite actors for that reason.",4oh39s

d4gxs3x,"No, no - why give it a label of kids' movie. Really? It deserves so much more credit than that. Why is it a kids' movie? Because it's a cartoon? Animation isn't a genre. It's not ""kids only but adults can hitch a ride."" Pixar has been making *great movies* since the 90's. It's thinking like this, the whole ""...for a kids' movie"" bit that's keeping amazing animation down in the mainstream's eye. 

Every time an animated film does something extraordinary, it always has to get that footnote. It's unfair. These movies are for *everyone*. I believe Pixar goes into their movies with that in mind. I doubt anyone there is saying to themselves when trying to nail any given scene, ""I'm making a kid's movie."" They're making timeless, ageless art that everyone can appreciate. They're geniuses for achieving that WITHOUT things like twerking dogs and anthropomorphic Tic-Tacs.",4oh39s

d4kn2f2,"I genuinely feel a bit bad for you if you cant suspend your disbelief as, presumably, an adult who went to go see a movie about an animated talking fish. Why even bother going to such a movie if you expect realism, just enjoy the absurdity. I can list dues ex machinas in literally every single pixar/disney movie, or things that make no sense, even in the best ones. Sure an entire house can fly through the air cause of 10,000 balloons. Its just silliness.",4oh39s
d4l3s25,"It's a cartoon movie about talking fish... Of course the people who made the movie want to make money, but that it itself doesn't make it a bad movie.  It doesn't have value as a story?  Seems like not having a disability stop you from believing in yourself and the importance of being part of a family is pretty decent value on story to me.  I just don't get the point of being upset over realism because an octopus drives a van or over the PH levels of fish tanks in a children's cartoon movie where the animals can all talk.  ",4oh39s
d4cm26p,"The worst part to me though was the way they backtracked on the major characters from the first ones. It's a basic movie standard for your characters to have arcs, and in Finding Nemo each one had an incredible, emotional arc. Nemo goes from a resentful, gung ho young kid who actively disobeys people around him, to learning to appreciate what he has and listen to those with more wisdom and experience than him. Marlin goes from an overprotective father scared of losing the only thing he has left, to being more free form and loose, letting his kid learn and be himself without being too hovering. These are character arcs that make sense, that people can relate too. Even Dory has one in Finding Nemo, starting as someone with nothing but the present, to someone who has people she cares about and remembers because they've helped her and been important to her. What's her arc in this one? She hits her head, remembers her parents, finds them and now she can remember things. She doesn't learn anything. She has no growth of any kind. She gets to them, and that's it. 

That's not the worst of it though. Marlin and Nemo seem to have backtracked on the very arcs that caused them to grow in the first one. Marlin is overprotective and hovering on a fully grown adult the entire movie, and is never called out for it by Nemo. He's the same character as he was at the beginning of the first one, and he's still the same character at the end. 

Now these secondary complaints may seem like nitpicks, and most of the time I'd be crucified for pointing them out in a kids movie. But like I said, I hold Pixar to a higher standard, and they are not meeting it any longer. There are so many weird, logical inconsistencies that were absent in the first one but pop up all the time here. Things like the sea lions showing no interest in the fish right in front of them, or all of the fish somehow being able to read, or know what a truck is. Things like the beluga whale using his sonar as some magic clairvoyance instead of actually using it like freaking sonar. Or a bucket constantly sloshing water but never going down in volume. Or the fish staying above water constantly but never having to go back under to breath. Every time they talked to those sea lions I was reminded of the part at the beginning of Finding Nemo where Marlin is looking for the boat with Nemo on it and he takes a deep breath underwater so he can go up to the surface. Those small details, those details that separate a movie like Inside out or Zootopia from something like this or Shrek 3, are the ones that throw me out of the movie constantly, and I couldn't stand it. 

The script is the last thing I'll touch on, because this can be chalked up to a difference of opinion for sure. I prefer scripts like Wall-e, that prefer to show you the state of the world, and let you infer from them. This doesn't mean that there can't be any dialogue, and if my love for Finding Nemo isn't apparent, I'll just say now that I love that movie. But this one had a penchant for spelling out every little tiny thing. I don't remember how many times I rolled my eyes when another flashback popped up just to hammer over the head ""this is where Dory got her Just Keep Swimming song from!"" (a scenario in which the parents had just told her to stop swimming and then immediately tell her that by the way). Every tiny character moment wasn't dwelled upon, but instead used to set up yet another flashback to hammer home ""yes Dory loves her parents! See! Here she is, loving them again, and getting sad when she doesn't remember!"" It didn't flow, it wasn't a natural type of storytelling. It just served to again, throw me completely out of the story every time I thought something compelling might happen. Then there were little dialogue inconsistencies, like the aforementioned ""Dory stop swimming and look where you're going! But wait, let's teach you a song! Just keep swimming!"" When the octopus and Dory are in the petting zoo aquarium part and they ""escape"" by using that song, the octopus is amazed that Dory got them to escape. Except, they're STILL IN THE TANK. And the only way all the kids left is because the octopus squirted everywhere! She had nothing to do with it, and the outcome would have been the same with or without her! 

Then there were so many times when the fish would be flopping around, doing things in plain view of hundreds of people that I thought for sure this was some alternate reality where everyone was blind. How can an aquarium personnel looking for an octopus not notice when an entire tank goes black with ink? How can none of the people around them see this stroller moving on its own, with an octopus at the bottom and a fish in the sippy cup? How does no one notice when fish are jumping up and down from tank to tank while they're loading the tanks? This is lazy storytelling. This is contrived storytelling.

*sigh* I didn't expect much from this movie. In fact, I thought it would be pretty mediocre going into the film. But seeing all the reviews online gave me just the smallest amount of hope. I was sorely disappointed. I know this is not going to be the prevailing opinion, and looking down at all the comments below me I see most people sincerely loved it. I'm glad some people did, but I really hope Pixar can see the flaws of this movie, and not make the same mistakes in any of their numerous sequels coming out.

If you just view it as a funny movie yea that's fine, but when you view Finding Dory through the lens of allegories to people with disabilities, Gerald is a bit strange. It doesn't matter at all for kids, my friend and I both work/worked with clients with disabilities and that part just made me re-live the experiences clients told to me.

d4obhhj,"Just saw it today. I completely agree. I have been looking forward to this movie since I heard about it several years ago and felt sure Pixar would move mountains to make this sequel incredible. They didn't. Not even close. 

One of my complaints is that they oversimplified Dory's backstory. In Finding Nemo, Dory seems like she might be a middle aged fish who has a good bit of life experience. In this sequel, we see her as a a baby, she gets lost, and then NOTHING happens to her until the moment she meets Marlin. That really diminished her character for me. This movie takes a multi-dimensional character and turns her into a one-note overgrown child. 

It bothered me more than it should have that Nemo did not age between the two movies. I would have liked to have seen Nemo as a young adult, making decisions on his own, helping Dory out perhaps in a direct way. Maybe Marlin didn't need to be in this movie, maybe he did. But having the EXACT SAME relationship dynamic between Marlin and Nemo felt really boring to me and like a lost opportunity for character growth/change. 

Finally, the plot, starting with the point that they get to the Marine Life aquarium place is just way more complicated than it needed to be. (Quarantine, Open Ocean, the whale enclosures, the Tide Pools, the area outside with the Sea Lions, various mechanisms to move fish from once place to another, strollers and coffee pots and mop buckets and fountains and green pails--and we see most of these more than once) The audience is so busy keeping track of who is where that there is no opportunity to connect with characters. I feel like Hank was a good character that I couldn't make a connection with because every scene he was in was like Mission:Impossible routine with characters moving from one place to another in impossible ways. 

Destiny and Bailey were useless. I really didn't like them at all. 

There are no good laughs in this movie either. A few humorous moments but not much more than that. 

In the end we have an infantalized Dory whose crowning moment of the film is elation at being reinserted into her role as a baby fish to devoted parents. I guess Pixar thought ""misses mommy and daddy"" was all the character development Dory needed. She deserved better IMO. ",4oh39s
d4j5zor,The fish are talking and you are worried about octopuses driving vehicles?,4oh39s
d4jjoho,"I agree with you..
The sequel really just came out of nowhere and it wasn't anywhere close to being as polished as the original was. The heart of the movie was there - an emotional journey of Dory finding her parents and a message of acceptance and love. But it was just a cluttered mess - the pacing was off, the characters felt forced, Nemo had zero bearing and no reason to be in this movie (besides making sassy comments to his dad), and overall it just didn't feel cohesive. 

It's like they had a really solid base of a plot, then they just threw in whatever characters, references, and convoluted solutions just to make the two ends meet. This movie really was a movie exclusively for children, which is uncommon for a Pixar movie.

Going from sad random to happy random a character arc isn't.

But it did have a lot of promise. Hank was the star from his first scene until the end. He was surprising, funny, and empathetic. If they just cut out the sealion BS (they were sealions right? The two Aussies with the dorkbird and the dorksealion? That entire interaction went nowhere and meant nothing, and the way they chased off dorklion was kind of meanhearted, like the entire audience was silent as they played through that joke. If they stole those 5 minutes to give Hank some more reason for why he did what he was doing, or why he ultimately switched his mind it would have... wait. You know what Hank just got shafted in this entire thing. Dory's big thing with ""having a plan isn't what makes life great, don't live in a box"" is just not on-point. He is constantly adjusting, ad-libing, making the big choices in a scary unboxed environment, and somehow he's the foil to Dory's happy go lucky attitude? He's SEEN things, man.

That's been their thing since *Toy Story 2*. Melancholy has been a major feature in Pixar movies for nearly as long as they have been making them.

I thought this movie was even lighter than its predecessor. *Finding Nemo* opened with death, already more serious than anything in *Finding Dory*. It cast a shadow over the entire movie, and Nemo's mom certainly didn't come back at the end.

There may not actually be whalespeak (why would there be since mammals and humans and fish and birds seem to all speak the same language - everyone understands the sealions, Sigourney Weaver, the pelican and seagulls), or if that's contradicted by FN then Destiny and Bailey can probably speak both whale and 'base', but Dory only speaks base and thinks she speaks whale.",4oh39s

d4lsv0p,"well, if you want a totally realistic film, then finding nemo would be about a fish getting illegally taken from a a reef, and nobody cares, the end.

you have to suspend SOME disbelief to make any sort of movie make sense and be reasonable. but finding dory quite literally jumps the shark.

Marlin, the neurotic and anxious father, is now just a dick to Dory. He asks a couple of asshole seals who bully a mentally retarded seal (never explained) to help them break into a building where Dory is. They summon a swarm of birds, one of which is also mentally retarded. They teach Marlin how to hypnotize the retarded bird and make it carry him and Nemo in a bucket.

Him and his son later flip 5 feet out of a small freshwater tank and gymnastically flip across a perfectly timed chain of fountains.

Meanwhile, a Beluga whale has selective X-Ray vision. he can see through the stone itself and perceive a birds-eye view of a maze of pipes. He can track a truck going down a highway from an aerial perspective, but his powers are ranged, and when the truck leaves range his selective X-Ray vision turns into radio static.

There was an interesting character in the Octopus. He was worrisome, and anti-social. He had a change of heart(s) throughout the film. but he had some quirks. He hated the idea of the ocean. Why? beats me, they didn't explain shit about him or his background. throughout the entire film, he has wanted nothing more than to escape the ocean and go to a nice aquarium in Cleveland. suddenly, at the end, he reverses his decision. fuck if i know why he didn't want to in the first place.

Finding dory wasn't garbage, or even bad. It was just entertaining enough, and totally ""eh"". the one really memorable thing that happened in that film, was Sigourney Weaver.",4oh39s
d4m904m,"Within the context of the film, yes it is more realistic. We can accept Dory's ability to speak 'whale' and read English, because her past is pretty unknown. In this film, it's convenient plot device and action sequences all the way through. 

The sharks were interesting, multifaceted characters in the first film, so we as the audience could accept that they were vegetarian. The danger that ensued once Bruce couldn't control his hunger was believable. This film had no lasting sense of danger. I can suspend my belief enough for fish moving about in plastic bags. An octopus driving a truck, a demented bird conveniently carrying fish with a bucket, and Marlin and Nemo catapulting across the aquarium were a little much.",4oh39s

Inside Out created an ingenious alternative world while linking and incorporating the 'real' world action, and had the same sort of emotional stakes as the Toy Story films, in terms of speaking to its audience about the pain and wonder of growing up. It was also hilarious, and gorgeous.

Finding Dory seemed to me to be an inferior retread of Finding Nemo, and one of the weaker Pixar films. I can sort of see what you mean about the plot of Inside Out (the journey) but the whole aquarium sequence seemed thoroughly 'look over there let's go there!' to me, aided and abetted by Dory's forgetfulness, which rapidly became tiresome.

We are told quite literally that anything within the Memory Dump in Inside Out becomes forgotten. If your heart was wrenching when you realized Bing Bong sacrificed himself to send Joy to the top, then the rules of the world worked and it was a fair reaction. You were promised that things in the Memory Dump die. And you believed it and had the accurate emotion when someone with a good selfless heart was left in there.

 If however you just said ""its a fucking movie about talking 
emotions that live inside our heads"" why not allow everything then? 


""it's a fucking movie about talking emotions that live inside our heads. Bing Bong should just disperse into a million particles and teleport to the top so he could live."" You would consider that a cop-out. But a cop out of what? Of the rules. 

This is how good fiction works. ",4oh39s
d4g74bq,"Every fiction has an internal logic, just like you accept that there's magic in the universe of Harry Potter, or the technology to bring back dinosaurs in the universe of Jurassic Park.

But if the dinosaurs started casting spells, or Harry Potter showed up riding a raptor, you'd cry foul, because it breaches the foundational assumptions of that fiction's universe.

Likewise, sea creatures having human-level intelligence and conversing in English is part of the Finding Nemo universe's internal logic. And it's consistent.

But when one of the fish is psychic, or the fish can hear voices across thousands of feet of distance, or things just *happen* to fall in an unbelievably, improbably lucky way to advance the plot, that goes beyond the universe's base definition. That's just bad writing, because the authors were unable to find a way to make the story work without breaking their own rules.",4oh39s
d4ksmrn,"But I loved most Pixar Films up until 2010. I don't have a problem with suspension of disbelief. I have a problem with stories that are just trying to milk money out of the audience's familiarity with the characters, without having a genuine intrinsic value as a story.

I did love Inside Out, too. *THAT* was true Pixar.

But Toy Story 3, Finding Dory, Cars 2, Monsters University, Brave, whatever that shitty Dinosaur movie was called....it's all second-rate.",4oh39s
d4e01qz,"Dory overcame her disability and learned that she CAN do whatever she puts her mind to and found her parents. How is that not growth. Marlin even sees her at the end getting better. He is the same Marlin, just smart enough to know Dory should be watched because she WILL hurt herself. He isn't that over protective and was willing to let Dory take them to California so she could meet her family. He would BARELY let Nemo go to school in the first movie and now he's taking him across the ocean. Thats development. 

Also the Octopus is going to be unrealistic. Its a cartoon. Dory reads in english even though there are no books underwater. It doesnt need to make sense in our world as long as it makes sense in theres. Thats what makes it a movie. And the movie starts with old jokes to get you invested. Its familiar. 

Just keep swimming doesn't literally mean keep swimming, it means keep moving forward and you'll succeed. Hank would have stayed and hid forever if Dory didn't drag him out so the kid could touch him. 

And Nemo absolutely called Marlin out. Did we even watch the same movie? He was mad his dad kept doubting her and wanted him to trust her to do what she had to do. I literally can remember him getting mad at Marlin for this being its own scene. And who cares if a bucket kinda sloshes and the volume is the same. Did that REALLY take you out of the movie",4oh39s

It seems to be the same quality as ""Cars 2"" with a poor attempt to make a side character the main focus, but there's nothing compelling about her, or her journey. With every flashback or ""what would Dory do"", we couldn't help but roll our eyes and wonder how much time was left. 

Couldn't believe that with the Disney/Pixar film creation process, that this was the best cut available. Marlin and Nemo have really no reason to be along for the journey, other than to offer comedic relief or to be rescued.

I'm glad some folks enjoyed it, but certainly wouldn't rate this in the top 10 of Pixar's offerings. ",4oh39s
d4ddua3,"I agree about the flashbacks; to me it seemed like a ""cop-out"" storytelling device (magically attach significance to any phrase anybody utters!) which became overused.

They also bring an added burden on the audience to keep track of yet *another* story arc, which didn't do favours for the overall pacing. Fun fact: the director originally intended to reveal the barracuda attack from the first film in this manner, but decided against it for the same reason.",4oh39s

They didn't help, they didn't do much emotionally, they seemed ""worked in"" to the story. Maybe if they had been put in an exhibit earlier?

It's clearly established in the movie's universe that the octopus is sentient with a large amount of dexterity when it comes to using his limbs; he's basically a human in octopus form, which means it's not that big of stretch that he could figure out how to temporarily (and poorly) drive a truck. But the fish are still living beings, they clearly still need to eat, and even a human in fish form would die if stuck in a plastic bag for a year.

Seriously, we know you'd rather watch us 197 times in a row than *any other studio!*  We're here to entertain everyone!""  I mean, every other Pixar film does a great job of being internally consistent, I just never have these kind of suspension of disbelief issues with their other films.

Individually, we both asked the people behind us tell their kid to sit put, they ignored us.  After that me and the other guy got fed up and told the parents that we'd talk to the manager if they didn't stop it, as the kid was basically disrupting half the damn row.

Even Gerald gave the sea lions the bucket and got a rock at the end. I think the message that Pixar wanted to convey was that despite being laughed at and made fun of, they all became an integral part of the team, they all became accepted.

d4ibq7x,"This argument is senseless. I agree that most fictional universes need their own set of laws and logic. They have to make sense in the confines of that universe. However, consider the Finding Nemo universe. At least two doors in the movie slam shut on their own after our heroes swim through them. (Oh, those magic doors. Good thing they were so enchanted). A clown fish and a tang get chased by an angler fish (they'd be crushed by the pressure down there and die). They survive jellyfish stings (plausible, I suppose...but generally a sting kills smaller fish). The EAC flows at a lazy pace - not the roller coaster ride it is in the movie. A whale blows not only water out of its blowhole, but two fish as well (utterly impossible). Gill somehow manages wedge his slender body into a bubbler and launch himself out of a fish tank and onto a little girl's head halfway across the room (um...). Gill manages to fling Nemo into the drain with conveniently-placed dental tools. A bunch of carp or whatever swim down and bust a fishing boat (would the bottom fish simply not be crushed?) 

My point? Finding Nemo is a perfect movie. A *perfect movie*. And I think what we can gather from it is that, in this universe...anything is possible as long as it is believable. I'd totally buy that two fish can swim to the bottom of the ocean and back up again - if I didn't understand how water pressure works. I'd totally buy the whole whale thing - if I didn't understand that whale lungs are not filled with water. It's not a science fiction movie or Middle Earth-type fantasy that begs its own laws and logic. It's a father and son story, and everything serves that end. Is that lazy or careless? I'd argue no, because the purpose of the movie isn't photo-realism. It's believability, and there's a difference. 

Also, I pointed out all the ""What?"" moments in Nemo because, frankly, nothing even comes close in Dory. Absolutely nothing. If the worst complaints are that the fish can hear distant sounds in water (which is actually possible), Marlin and Nemo hop on water spouts (and eventually miss one anyway), and that Becky the Loon has good timing (comedy, folks...comedy), then the movie is in good shape.",4oh39s
d4yjz3i,The tank in Nemo was in view of a window no?,4oh39s
d4i02nf,The set of rules and internal logic of this movie is that fish can live in any water and ph and temperature is irrelevant. They establish it over and over so it's not some random thing they changed. ,4oh39s

Yo that'd be awesome.",4oh39s
d4ic7jq,"At what point in the movie did sound travel thousands of feet of distance? They establish very early in the movie that Dory and Destiny were ""pipe pals"" and spoke through the pipe system in the aquarium. That's a rule right there. They instantly establish that the pipes are like a telephone system. If the characters are able to speak over thousands of feet, as you say, then I'd argue that they're well within the believable range given what we were told previously. I'm pretty sure that nobody in the movie yells to other characters from a distance without using the pipes. ",4oh39s
d4l5fm6,"I assume that you're talking about Bailey the whale when you say that one fish is psychic.  I don't see at all how that is inconsistent since we didn't really learn anything about whales in the first movie other than the one who swallowed Marlin and Dory, and we literally didn't see any other beluga whales before we met Bailey.  

Beluga whales do use echolocation, and so a cartoon movie took that ability and exaggerated it, so what?  I'd say that is a highly common type of thing for these types of movies to do.  

I just don't see where they stepped out of the definition of the universe too badly.  It's not like Marlin or one of the other fish suddenly grew a pair of legs and used those to drive the truck or anything.  The movie had been exaggerating Hank's ability to do things from the very start of when we first met Hank, so it wasn't exactly a shock when he was able to press the gas pedal and turn the steering wheel.  I could perhaps better see your point if maybe Nemo was pressing the gas while Marlin worked the steering wheel or something, but even then this was in no way a movie presented in a way where it should be taken so seriously.

d4cs58o,"part of what makes wall-e such an incredible film is that it's bigger than us; it's more than a story about individuality, friendship, loyalty or family values, etc., but a story that transcends beyond all those things which delves into legitimate issues and the reality of our own grim future. it's truly an untouchable animated film and frankly, even though i would like a wall-e 2, i would not be disappointed if it was the only film of that universe.

and you have to also account for your own maturity. it's not that stanton created a subpar film, but for every kids out there, each of his films become gifts to their childhood. so yeah i understand why you would be disappointed, but assuming you are well into your adulthood, try to walk into those pixar films with a little less expectations next time. they are suppose to be good family outings.",4oh39s

I thought it was a cute movie but, while it was fun at times, it was entirely unnecessary as a movie/story and there's nothing really memorable about it like the first movie.

Also now that I've had time to think about it, another complaint that I have is that we never get into hanks backstory. He is just there as a plot device for dory to move around the aquatic center. Also from the beginning, he hates the ocean, and wants to move to Cleveland and stay in a solitary tank, and he iterates this throughout the whole movie. All of the sudden when he rescues dory a second time, dory firmly states that he is going to go with them to the ocean, and all of the sudden he just agrees to it and it's like he's loved the ocean all his life. I really liked the visuals of Hank, but his character was just... Depthless?

Another 'plot device' complaint (I'm honestly not sure if this is the right phrase), the sea otters at the end just decide to help dory and co. In like less than a minute. With no reason to do so. They decide to climb up onto the free way and make a red rover line. Call it suspension of disbelief or 'I just need to turn my brain off' but that's just another shoehorned way of advancing the plot.

I did like some moments, I felt some emotion. But it just wasn't as magical as finding nemo. It felt small. And finding nemo felt like an epic journey across the ocean. As well as my other complaints.",4oh39s

The Marine Mammal centers primary purpose is to help sick sea lions and elephant seals. The rehab them and then release them. You can visit it but its primary purpose is to be an animal hospital.

One of the unrealistic things of the film was the Blue Tangs are tropical fish and wouldn't survive off the coast of California.

So you would be fine if in, say, Star Wars, in the third one Luke could suddenly shoot lasers out of his eyes and grew a hundred feet tall? I mean, there's talking aliens and space battles, so what would be the problem with that? A movie can do whatever it wants, but still must follow it's own logic.

1. There was a good flow, basically intro to park, intro to heads of park, park features, new projects, dangers, animal expert, thrn shit goes down the toilet. Camera work was fine, but it was geard for the 3D experience, wide shots were beautiful similar to Lucas StarWars prequels, which had some stunning shots.

2. I agree the Indominus escape could've been done better. Redhead could have directly contacted hq without driving off, which caused the actual problem. Also 50foot 1+ ton dino makes thuds by footstep, and since staff around, it couldn't run off to be Ninja Rex. 

3. Also the escape of the flying dinos and tranq/electrocuting them could've been done better. Kiss scene was forced though. 

4. Pratt did well, he came off as a wildlife expert if you've seen one.  He was going for the cool calm collected demeanour and I found it rather good. In fact ignoring all the hype for Pratt, this role legit made me a fan of Pratt.

5. Bryce was ok, running in heels made no sense true,  her character was a little pissy.

6. No memorable moments,  dafuq? Raptors and bike scene, dino duel at the end was just fantastic, raptor training was woahdude, mososaurus was nice,  gyrosphere was a novel ideasimilar to safari rides,  discussion between scientist and masrani was really memorable and well delivered.

I'll still argue, though, that the reason the whale spoke whale was because it's more mysterious, from a storytelling perspective, to have him serve as a largely silent savior who can maybe speak to one of the protagonists every now and then. If I wanted to give an explanation about why Bailey doesn't speak whale, I'd say he's a Beluga and they speak a different dialect or language altogether, which is established in Nemo. Perhaps Beluga speak is tied to their sonar in some way, or he groups whale speak in with his sonar and just won't do it. Also, he has been in an aquarium for some time, so maybe he gradually stopped speaking whale and adopted human speak (and Destiny picked up whale speak from him and speaks it because she considers herself part whale or simply enjoys it).",4oh39s
d9lxcx2,"I agree it definitely was.

But I still don't understand why you think Destiny was actually teaching her whale. Going off FN knowing what whale sounds like, we never see Dory or Destiny speaking whale. Possibly neither can. When they first met Destiny probably said she was a whaleshark and baby Dory kept asking her to teach her whale. Eventually Destiny relented and said 'Uh sure ok' and did the silly whale voice.

Sorry to preach, but I just find it wildly ignorant (not targeting you, merely the point of view in general) to say that a movie is a kids' movie because it's animated. I mean, I can walk into a toy aisle and find loads of Dory, Good Dino, Toy Story things...but that's marketing. That stuff sells. It's money, baby. I can also walk into a toy aisle and find things from Prometheus, Pacific, Rim, Terminator, etc. so I never find that to be a valid argument.

d4ektu6,"Sure, but that's not a massive amount of people. $53 million opening day. Okay, so like 5.5 million people. Half of them are non-family viewers. That's 2.75 million people. Most of which are still going to see it at peak times and cheaper show times. So a couple hundred thousand go to see in IMAX opening day. Split that between the different IMAX show times all across the country and you don't get a whole lot, especially when the majority will be during the day/early evening, not at night.",4oh39s
d4dd28m,"Again, in the universe of the movie, talking animals are not ridiculous at all. Just because it would be ridiculous in the real world, does *not* suddenly mean the movie can do whatever it wants and throw logic out the door. In a world of talking animals, talking animals is normal. Surviving for a year inside a plastic bag could be argued as not normal. It doesn't go with the logic of its OWN universe the way talking animals do.",4oh39s
d4dud9m,"For sure. Especially seeing as Hank's past didn't ever get touched on. It felt really strange for him to be so anti-social the whole move and just want to be left alone, but the suddenly just be okay with going back to the ocean with the others. ",4oh39s
d4f3t9z,Wait no what,4oh39s
d4df64r,I live in America and actually didn't know she did it. Ive only ever heard Davids. It just made sense since its a BBC show isnt it?,4oh39s
d4crs39,I watched it on Animal Planet and it was Sigorney Weaver narrating it.,4oh39s
d4efbx7,I had no idea until I was around 15 that was a blowjob scene. No way a 7 year old would pick that up,4oh39s
d4k7426,I can live with this explanation.,4oh39s
d4ick9d,I agree.,4oh39s
d4jafhw,"Propelled somewhere new...? Like when, in Nemo, they just happen to find Crush and are propelled somewhere new? Or when the whale happens to find them and take them the last leg of the journey?

I feel like you're really grasping for straws here, trying to find a problem where there really isn't one. Marlin and Nemo accidentally got dumped in a gift shop aquarium next to fountains, and they used said fountains to get into a pool that clearly wouldn't have been their top pick if they'd known exactly what it was beforehand. And it's not like they ""flawless victory'd"" those fountains. They missed one. So, it became believable at that moment.",4oh39s
d4jjnol,The cars veered out of the way themselves.,4oh39s
d4qvgn3,"Yes she did. She repeatedly said ""right, left, right"" over and over again after they make the u turn. ",4oh39s
d4l4hp8,"At what point did the makers of this movie state in the movie universe or outside of the movie universe that they were aiming for realism to the point of where the animals in the movie could only do things that real life animals could do?  

If you want to analyze things to that point then how could some of the fish such as Dory read in the first place?  How would Hank have any sort of concept of what Cleveland even was?  How could any of the fish know directions for getting to places like California or even know what California is in the first place?  How did they get to California and just happen to end up on the one specific spot that Dory was from?  How does every drain in this universe go directly into the ocean?  How does Dory remember what she's looking for in the first place if she is supposed to forget things so quickly?

I don't really care if none of those things make sense because it's a kid's cartoon movie about talking fish.  I'm just amazed that you'd be so concerned over Hank's ability to drive the truck but not be bothered about any of those other things.  

I mean, I'll admit to asking some of those questions purely out of fun or to be funny, but I just don't understand taking it so seriously that the talking cartoon fish doing things that real fish wouldn't be able to do somehow ruins or at least lessons the quality of the movie for you.  

If these two movies were based totally in reality then Finding Nemo would have been a completely depressing movie where we see Marlin hopelessly searching for his son who will spend the rest of his days in a fish tank.  That is unless you actually think that fish in the real world often escape fish tanks and make their way back to their families in the ocean who have come looking for them.  ",4oh39s
d4ilvvx,"Wait, I remember now. Destiny and Bailey's enclosures are literally right next to the ocean. And when Dory calls Destiny, she's right at the wall and is shouting in whale. It's not thousands of feet, it's, what...50? I can yell to someone 50 feet away and have them hear me. ",4oh39s
d4ig1af,"I don't remember that, honestly. Like, really. Are you sure you didn't miss them speaking via the pipes again or Bailey seeing Dory signaling for them via sonar? Don't forget, those pipes that link the tanks together also flow out to the ocean.",4oh39s
d4dd7o1,"Lol. Alright, man. Salt water fishes surviving in tap water goes with it's OWN universe just fine, but surviving inside of a bag? NO FUCKING WAY.",4oh39s
d4crv63,"Yeah, because Animal Planet is owned by the same company that owns the Discovery Channel",4oh39s
d4dd9t4,"I never said that, in fact I agree, that goes against it's own universe just as much, if not more so.",4oh39s
