f918ann,One of the most affecting parts to me was at the end when De Niro was telling his nurse about how most people don’t even know who Jimmy Hoffa was anymore and it seems like he’s about to launch into some starry eyed story time and she politely but flippantly cuts him off to take his blood pressure and as soon as she’s done she walks off.,e2149d

f8vbzlh,"What stood out to me in the film is the way that Jimmy gets killed. We know it's coming, and we know that this will be Frank's most affecting and difficult murder. But based on just how their relationship is built and plays out through the film, I thought that it would culminate in Jimmy suddenly realizing that Frank will murder him and saying something like, ""Frank, how could you do this? I treated you like family. I loved you!"" - something that's drawn out and wrought with angst and tenderness before the act. But nope, as soon as he turns to the door, Frank just whips out his gun, fires twice in succession, and it's all over in a second. Frank murders Jimmy just like he did with the numerous other victims we saw - quick and emotionless, like it's all just part of the job (emphasizing the military parallel). It's disturbing because Jimmy truly loved and valued Frank, and Frank is agonizing over what he will have to do, and yet, the way he carries out the murder of his best friend, someone he said he will always back, is instinctive. It speaks volumes about Frank's lack of soul (or at least, it being so numb).",e2149d

I love that so much. It's just so unglamorous. Of course the answer to one of those great 20th century mysteries would be so simple and so not extraordinary. And even if that's not what actually happened to Hoffa you know the real truth is probably just as sad and mundane. It plays so well with the dour final act.",e2149d

f8v1in3,"Saw the movie a week ago at the cinema, will watch at home again at some stage but it was easily one of the best movies I’ve seen this year if not the best.

Perfectly paced, didn’t feel like a 3 and a half hour picture, acting was probably the best I’ve seen in a long while, everyone pulled their weight perfectly, was a lot funnier than I thought it’d be.

Besides the main 3 (everyone will be talking about how great they were and rightfully so) thought Stephen Graham was fantastic. 
Pesci even after all this time and not having done a live action role for 8 or 9 years gave an amazing performance.

Thought a great job was done to make all the characters feel like they were just regular guys that just had jobs to do and got on with it, not like typical mobster movies where they’re on a pedestal or larger than life.

f8vgwmc,"I saw it in the theatre a few weeks ago. 

Robert De Niro's character is such a self indulgent sociopathic prick with zero self awareness.  

It's so strange to have less sympathy for a character as they get older.  When he's old and frail and so scared of the finality of death while also being so falsely repentant for his crimes.  Unwilling to truly confess them.

f8v0hx9,"> “The unexamined life is not worth living”

This cliched Socrates translation (the motto of my high school) helped frame how I see the character of Frank Sheeran. Personally, I found THE IRISHMAN to be profoundly moving. Any epic this broad will speak differently to each viewer, so I’ll just articulate my own narrow reading–the film as an exploration of how those who do not interrogate their own actions will live a meaningless life. 

Frank Sheeran is incapable of meaningful introspection.

He attempts self *reflection* (indeed, that structures the movie), but he struggles to interrogate his own narrative. Frank is a shockingly passive participant (both as an aged storyteller, and as a mob foot soldier), and his thoughtless life becomes a tragic embodiment of the Socrates quote.

Frank represents the *banality* of evil, a consistently undermotivated and passive foot soldier. In the moment, Frank can tell himself comfortable justifications–he’s working to better his family, his friends, the union, and himself. Yet, as these motivations are exposed as hollow, we’re confronted with a sobering alternative. What if Frank’s central failure was not greed or cruelty, but rather, an inability to interrogate his own choices? What if Frank was a passenger in his own narrative, unable to question whether there was another way?

This idea is at its most poignant and literal in Frank's flashback to war. He stands guard with his gun as the prisoners dig their own graves, musing “I always wondered why they kept digging”. He is painfully unaware of the irony, and we will watch Frank dig his *own* grave for the next three hours. As a hitman, Frank holds the gun, so he blithely assumes that he must be the soldier, but we see him as the prisoner with a shovel (the loss of individual agency in the mob collective is a Scorsese staple). The final act provides us with a biting callback to this scene when Frank goes to the morgue to purchase his own coffin (the expression “digging your own grave” made literal).

The reasons for Frank’s lack of introspection are both personal and societal. Toxic masculinity is a pervasive theme in Scorsese’s filmography, and Frank takes that emotional repression to the extreme. Hoffa grumbles that Frank never shares how he feels, but the problem lies not in his refusal to share, but in his refusal to allow himself to feel in the first place. Even the impoverished language of the mobsters is crafted to inhibit meaningful dialogue, with each new order provided as a euphemism. The most devastating of these is when Russell seals Hoffa’s fate (and with it, Frank’s), with the chilling line *“It's what it is”*. Could the euphemism be any more apt? Frank’s life “is what it is” *because* Frank never questions whether it could be anything different.

Frank’s refusal to confront his own self cannot save him from judgment. Peggy’s eyes provide a chilling visual motif, operating as Frank’s conscience, and those maturing eyes eventually pierce to the heart of who her father truly is. I’ve seen some argue that Anna Paquin’s role is undermined by her limited line count, but her silence is more powerfully damning than words could ever be. When she does speak, it is the signature line of the climax, a charged and desperate **“Why?”**. De Niro’s silent response is agonizing, and “Why?” is the enduring question that Frank has avoided confronting his entire life. Peggy’s follow-up statement (clarifying “Why… didn’t you call Jo?”) allows the plot to progress, but it’s that first question which we hear most clearly, and it will haunt Frank for the rest of his life. In his old age, Frank’s legacy is defined by the absence of these women who should have been his pride and joy.

In the heartbreaking final act, Frank attempts to atone for his “unexamined life” with a furious flurry of self reflection, yet it’s as inadequate as a study session the day after an exam. Introspection matters because it lets us make better decisions in the future, and with Frank’s fate sealed, these attempts are hollow. When Frank begs Delores to tell Peggy that he’s sorry, Delores angrily demands that he explain “For what?”. Once again, Frank has no good answer (although Delores is happy to fill in a few of the blanks, preemptively rebutting the claim that he did it to protect his family). In his final confession, Frank admits that he has no “remorse”, and I’m inclined to believe him. Of course he has regret (it consumes him), but true remorse requires substantive *reckoning* with your actions, which Frank still cannot do. How can you atone when you don’t understand your own agency? 

THE IRISHMAN is a somber, joyless epic, exploring the tragedy of a man’s wasted life. And yet, I don’t find it wholly bleak, because ultimately, *we are not Frank Sheeran*. The ambiguous final shot of the movie (Frank’s door left half open, a callback to his time with Hoffa), leaves us with a kernel of hope. I see this not as a statement about Frank (the camera draws away, leaving behind the man on his deathbed, his fate sealed); rather, it leaves the *audience* with the half open door, because our future remains yet unwritten.

Obviously, I was captivated by this movie, and this (far too long) post only scratches the surface. There is so much more to say about the work of Pesci and Pacino, the themes of death, legacy, & salvation, and the film’s technical achievements. Now that it is finally streaming, I'm just glad that everyone can share and enjoy this treasure of a movie.",e2149d

f8v3eho,"Everything from Sheeran’s celebratory dinner where they discuss finally putting the hit on Hoffa to that final shot of Sheeran alone in the dark of his room waiting to die is some of the most haunting and harrowing filmmaking I’ve ever seen. 

I was worried when this project was announced that Scorsese was just gonna revisit the substantive and stylistic well that he had already mined plenty in Goodfellas, Casino, and even The Wolf of Wall Street. But I’m so glad to be proven wrong in that this has way more to do with something like Mean Streets, or even Raging Bull. It’s a film about the deep moral guilt that comes with living your life unexamined until it’s too late and you have to live with the consequences, and in that sense, while this film does play with the associations to Goodfellas and Casino, it has way more to do with Scorsese’s more personal and religious films.",e2149d
f8vn7k9,"SPOILERS AHEAD:
For me, the last 50 minutes made the film. Up until then it felt like a by-the-numbers mafia film but when the last 50 min focuses on him in the nursing home, allowing that reflection to be had...that gave it the emotional payoff. 
Seeing Frank isolated to the point of having to choose his own casket because all his mob friends are dead and his family have, understandably, cut ties to him. I felt sorry for Frank, for how foolish he was.
Also I love how it tied back to earlier, seemingly random events, like Frank beating up the shopkeeper and stomping the hand off him in front of the daughter. Frank's realisation of the dysfunction he exhibited to his kids. His regret for how he behaved and a clear wish to do things differently.
This hit me personally too because it reminded me of my grandfather, who I loved, but my mother found a difficult man and he did say to her and the rest before passing he was sorry he wasnt there for them and thought wealth, going off working, putting food on the table was priority. Frank had a similar issue, the realisation that providing for your family is the minimum standard and not the be all and end all. Just being there for your kids, sitting with them, spending time with them and actually watching them grow up is so much more important. That struck a cord with me and gave the movie some emotional depth.",e2149d

Watch his eyes and body language in that scene. He looks like he's ashamed of the violence he's committed, but also highly alert, like he's still in survival mode. When she reminds him to take off his shoes, he's almost startled.

Pacino had more to work with and will probably get the nominations, but I think Pesci is equally deserving of best supporting actor.",e2149d

It's not as action-y, but i thought that was just to show how much more realistic it was. The only thing I didn't like was the beginning of the film, took me until half way to get immersed into it.

The part I loved best was when they were picking up Hoffa in the car. Hoffa goes on to talk about how he was waiting for ""40 minutes like a goddamn idiot."" That says so much about Hoffa's love for DeNiro, especially cause he'd never do that for anyone else. And you can see the distress on DeNiro's face. The fact that it all ended with just a quick couple of shots made it more emotional. Realistic. The whole Hoffa bit was fantastic.",e2149d

You know what got me? The old man arms. No matter what else you can’t make an old man’s arms look like a young man’s arms.

Neither Sheeran nor Hoffa had quite the physical presence they should have. I could sorta mentally convince myself Sheeran was this intimidating enforcer type with some effort, and Pacino was a great Hoffa *in spirit* but just didn’t quite seem like the bulldog presence in reality. Pacino was almost 20 years older than Hoffa ever was when they filmed this. That seems crazy to try to pull off. These were obviously old men.

In spite of that there was a ton to like. Including Pesci. The last hour or so was fantastic.

With different casting this could have been Top 5 Scorsese.",e2149d

f8z00a0,"It's a good movie, one that I'm definitely going to watch again and again at some point because it was impeccably edited and really just felt like a ton of content to deliver rather than a slog. Even Once Upon A Time In America, which this is almost similar to, never flowed this well. I could have honestly watched another hour if it was edited well.

But I got to say, watching Joe Pesci was MESMERIZING. Maybe it was partly the hiatus - I remember loving him in the 30 seconds cameo he was in The Good Sheppard too, so there definitely is some novelty to him just being here. But my God, he was incredible. The nuance, subtlety, and just carefulness of his performance was pure joy honestly. The character is thoughtful, deliberate, warm at times to people he cared for, but at the end of day, cold as ice. But I can't recall him being overly menacing one time, which for him is impressive, but you just knew he was extremely dangerous. Frighteningly good and probably my favorite performance of the year.",e2149d
f91koyd,"I have to say that was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. 

I spent the first act amazed by De Niro’s storytelling and scene setting. What a perfect intro for Pesci’s character. From the first line you can immediately see that this guy holds the strings. Honestly this was probably the most intimidating out of the three Pesci crime characters (DeVito, Santoro, and Buffalino).  The scene where Frank is casually talking about murdering POW’s and you can immediately see that Frank is the perfect soldier: strong, smart, careful, determined, loyal, and most of all didn’t question orders. 

Then Pacino steps in and the story takes off. Man did Pacino steal every scene he was in. Probably a top 3 Pacino performance in my books. They show the sub story with the Kennedy assassination to add depth to the characters and it was beautifully weaves into the second act. The scenes with Tony Pro and Pacino were legendary. Who wears shorts to a meeting? You’re more than ten minutes late you’re saying something. Just the way Pacino commanded the room as Jimmy Hoffa would have was legendary. And then there’s the end of the second act where what we all know happens happens and it’s perfect. It’s not a slowed down shot of Pacino falling to the floor with a violin playing in the background, it was a hit just like any of the other hits. I could really write more about how impressed I was with the second act of this film. It was probably 2.25 hours long and it felt like 30 minutes. 

And then it gets better and the themes of the movie begin to hit. Begins with a gutsy decision to give Peggy one line in the movie and it pays off beautifully. She truly saw through Frank, I believe even more so than the other daughters all the way to the very end. De Niro calling Jo incredible acting. I could feel the guilt and remorse in De Niro for the first time in this movie and it really adds to the theme of how ugly the gangster world gets. And then scene by scene it gets darker and darker and darker and we see how truly alone every single one of the gangsters ended up. Pesci in the prison playing that bowling type game and then being wheeled off to his deathbed. It then finishes with the conclusion to De Niro’s character and man is that shit sad. You can see it so clearly that De Niro is feeling some sort of guilt and remorse at that point. The leaving scene of the priest absolving Frank of his sins and then telling him he’s leaving and Frank asks him to leave the door open in hopes that someone will show that they care about him. 

Truly a sad film to its core. I felt very similarly to how I did at the end of raging bull. Scorsese really knows how to hit your soul with his movies. Also obligatory typical camerawork Scorsese compliment but as always Scorsese’s camera work is best in the business by far. Nobody does the slow moving camera mimicking a person walking through a scene at the same pace as the music in the background. Legendary. And yes the editing too, to make 3.5 hours feel like 1.5 hours takes an extreme amount of hard work and skill in your craft.

I’m going to have to watch it 2 more times b4 I can put it in my rankings but after my first watch probably going to find itself in my top 3 (yes I know basic r/movies movies but hey I like what I like)

The last 30 odd minutes of this movie are what sets it apart from say, Goodfellas, casino or the departed. I think that ending is what Scorcese really wanted to show us.

Seeing Pesci as a really really old man in prison was a heartbreaking. Not for the character, but for the realisation that its gonna happen to us all.

But no, Hoffa was so fucking stubborn. I find that incredibly tragic.

Seeing all of these people who I've spent nearly three hours with go away one by one and seeing Frank all alone in his room is just sad to see, and seeing him plan out his death and Peggy cutting off all contact with him was heartbreaking.

I was completely captivated by him every single time he appeared on screen. His stubborn, no bullshit style was hilarious as it was tragic towards the movie's conclusion. He deserves every award for this movie. 

 Joe Pesci too, knocked it out of the fucking park. We're all used to seeing him as the deranged violent criminal but in this he's subdued, friendly even, a gentle presence.

Robert De Niro was obviously great too. Very understated. We all know someone like him in this film. Old-school. No nonsense. Quiet. Doesn't like to make a big deal out of anything. Sad in a way that they're unable to properly express their emotions. He was great too.

This felt like a successor to movies like Goodfellas, which is one of my favourites. But I liked this movie for how different it felt at times. It was a more realistic, less glamourising look at this lifestyle. Usually the mobsters die in a blaze of glory but here, we watched the slow, sad decline of the movie's characters as they come to terms with the awful things they did.

f93thy3,"I think some people will be disappointed because when they think Scorsese they think Goodfellas which is a fast paced and upbeat film.

The Irishman meanders. It's slower paced and that's what I love it for. It reminded me a lot of No Country for Old Men by the Coen brothers. The films have a lot of similar themes.

I think the overall point of the film, and I hate to narrow it down to just a few things because it certainly is more than just this.. but if I had to bring it to a couple of three things it'd be about the following:

The mob and criminal life is never worth it. It's glamorized but the truth is that it more often than not just ends in death or loneliness. Look at the highest highs of criminal life. You'd probably think Escobar with his Billions in the 80's. His own private Zoo and mansion and girls and the most extravagant life you can conjure. I don't think you could reach a higher peak than Escobar at his prime. Top 3 richest man in the world, partied all the time, was treated almost as a deity by the locals where he operated. Even he ended up shot dead on a roof top with his ass hanging out.

Time is a big theme here too. How it just marches on and on with no resolution. This is a big theme in No Country for Old Men and I got the same feeling when both films come to a conclusion, the inevitability of it all. All these proud, notorious men but they all succumb to the slow crushing weight of death and old age. It just churns and churns and makes all their fights and killings and beefs and arguments for naught. Death takes them all the same, so was it really worth it getting into all those fights and not just enjoying life? Goes back to the theme of crime isn't really worth it.

Off the topic of themes, I enjoyed how raw the film was. The killings were quick and not glamorous. It felt authentic.

Finally, I like how Scorsese put those death notations around for all these characters who are shown as wild and entertaining in what they do just for a still shot that says ""Hey, you see this guy? How interesting and lively he is? Well, doesn't amount to shit because he gets killed in a few years. So you might think hey that'd be fun to be that guy but, not really."" Loved that. Anyways, great film, will watch many more times.",e2149d
f94q61h,"Al Pacino substantially elevated this movie. A lot of that is because Hoffa was just inherently the most interesting person of the people involved, but I thought the acting performance itself was one of Pacino's career bests. Obviously he invoked a lot of the usual Pacinoisms we've become accustomed to, but hey, that's what he's great at, you love to see it. Pacino's Hoffa is a wildly entertaining character, and he sort of turns the movie into a Greek tragedy where pride comes before the fall.",e2149d

fdof4nl,"I just rewatched The Irishman after being pretty lukewarm on it the first time around. Quite a lot has changed.

Firstly, the film has impeccable pacing thanks to the masterful editing of Thelma Schoonmaker. Secondly, the atmosphere, which seemed all too familiar on my first viewing, took on a life of its own upon rewatch. Thirdly, I was distracted by the CGI on my first viewing, so I went into this rewatch with the precise intention of ignoring it. This allowed me to enjoy the following thematic elements of the film.

The heart of the film is the relationship between Frank and his daughter, Peggy, which is odd since it doesn’t get much screen time compared to Frank’s relationships with his friends Russell and Hoffa. The re-occurrence of Peggy’s perceptive, concerned gaze towards her father and his mobster friends is a subtle display of the effects that living this lifestyle has on those around you. Unlike in Goodfellas where Henry’s children aren’t visibly effected, Peggy’s presence throughout the film shows an awareness to her father’s activities and, although Frank thinks his work is improving the lives of his family, his inability to see things through their eyes only causes them pain. For example, he’s more concerned with how Russell may be feeling around his child than with his own daughter’s misgivings.

The idea that a person living this lifestyle is essentially digging his own grave forms the thesis of the film. There is so much repetition throughout the movie, that it’s almost like each instance is another shovelful. Peggy’s gaze, Hoffa and Pro, the killings, stopping for cigarette breaks, showing up on time. By the end, what did it really amount to? There’s no reward, only the realization that you’ve lost everything. Unlike the prisoners of war, Frank had a choice to stop digging. But he chose a career of crime over family; duty over love.

Then there’s the question of Frank’s motivation. All in all, Frank is a dutiful man. Unlike Henry Hill, he’s not motivated by the glamour or the power or the women. He’s a military man and he just wants to prove his value, while making enough money to support his family. This movie gives us some insight into the mind of a high-functioning mass murderer. Frank isn’t soft like Henry, who was squeamish about the Billy Batts murder, but he also took no joy in his work; it didn’t bother him either way. Any trepidation he may have had towards committing murder were cast out during his time in WWII. It’s callousness that allows a murderer to function. Frank didn’t suffer or feel regret for his actions. They didn’t eat him alive like they did Raskalnikov in Crime and Punishment. He simply did his duty. And if that method of thinking is what’s burned into you during wartime, it’s easy to see how it might be difficult to separate yourself from it when you come home.

The pacing, the atmosphere, the acting, and the themes were all on the money. But still, in the end what were the takeaway scenes? In Goodfellas you have the Billy Batts murder, the “funny how” scene, the helicopters. What moments am I going to remember about the Irishman? I enjoyed the Gallo portion of the film, the various conversations at the banquet, Hoffa’s last ride, and the bread and wine scenes. But none of these have any pop or take on a life of their own. I’m all for a movie that favors taking its time, but the high points need to hit. “A great movie has three great scenes and no bad ones.”",e2149d

f8xn95r,"I felt the final 20 odd minutes (after Hoffa's murder) was the strongest part of the film. Perhaps it was because De Niro was no longer ""CGI'd"" so his performance was stronger than the younger version, but probably it was due to that agonizing culmination of the man's life. It was handled very well by Scorsese and Zallian. So many men in the film suffer these violent, sudden deaths but Frank's life just keeps on going, slowly, painfully, and alone. The irony of that was done brilliantly.",e2149d

The youngest he looks in the film is early 60s (late 50s if you really want to argue). But we are supposed to believe him as a man in his 30s when the film begins.

I like that Scorsese is still experimenting this far into his career. 

Watched it twice now and I must say it’s even better on second viewing. I may give it a third pass before the year’s end.

My main beef with the movie was that it was sometimes hard to figure out where in time scenes were. While the CGI de-aging was impressive, these guys still looked old at every point in the movie. It felt like DeNiro had his kids in his late 50s. You can flatten out the wrinkles, but you can't alter the way that their bodies move. The most egregious of this was the grocery beat down. So, I found that a bit difficult to accept and it would often pull me out of the scene.",e2149d
faa1ycj,"Ok, so I thought the movie was well done, amazingly acted, some great moments, and had a clear message, but I didn't find it gripping or compelling at all.  Here, the small snippets and individual performances stuck out more than the movie as a whole.  

I found my feelings towards the movie were overall, just sort of flat, just like Frank.  Frank was emotionless, basically, and just did what he was told.  He was just some sort of automaton hitman.  My feelings mirrored this, because since there was almost nothing  in it for Frank with respect to risk or suspense, I didn't really feel any either.   Even Russell, while, again, amazingly well acted by Peschi, was calm, collected, and cool, no matter the situation.  I sort of felt the same.  Characters were interesting, but it felt more like a documentary / expose piece rather than a mobster movie.   I think the same message could have been delivered with a more gripping movie.",e2149d

I remember there was a death that happened nearby my school. The picture of the victim was out there for everyone to see. And it was staged just like a mafia-style killing. It was the mafia.

I liked the movie overall- I was blown away around one hour because I thought the movie was about to end but there was still so much left- It was so good! 

The only issue I had was with the daughter- Peggy- why were they off with her aging? But then I thought perhaps it was deliberate because Peggy's character is kind of a window into Frank's POV and He sees her like that until she is older and less into his life. She is also kinda of hook for the audience to feel for Frank along with Hoffa and Russ. Cause otherwise he seems like psychopath.

Also she is conveniently is attached to Hoffa but dislikes Russ and her father even though all three of them are in the same boat- no explanation other than that Hoffa comes off as more friendly then Russ which is weird since Russ is quite a chill and friendly guy.

f963gob,"Great film. Still processing all of it.

My only complaint is that Pacino is a great actor and deserves all the accolades, but did not work for me as Hoffa. Pacino registered as Italian to me and I think the racial divide and Deniro’s conflict would have been more pronounced if Hoffa looked more Dutch/German as he was IRL.",e2149d
f8xdy6n,"Watching this with my grandma is one of the best movie moments of the year for me. She worked around Hoffa during his height of power, she worked with Fitz in particular. So her commentary throughout and pointing out at random times the men she had actually met in that crowd was pretty surreal and so informative. 

But, wow. This really lived up to the hype and then some. Thelma deserves an editing Oscar, not a single moment or minute did my mind begin to wonder. 

The tension is also unbearable. The whole fish conversation had me squirming. Gorgeous cinematography, costumes, outstanding set design. And marvelous performances from the whole cast. I would have liked one scene between Paquin and DeNiro, but I also understand why they didn't go in that direction. Also, the de-aging was mostly seamless, but I was confused at times as to what age they were, as they still looked pretty old even with the technology.

f8xubyv,I cannot believe that no major studio was interested in financing this film. Damn shame. And then you can really see Scorsese's point about theme park movies occupying cinema theaters. If a masterpiece like this from one of the greatest living directors is getting ignored then think about all the other directors who want to make their own visionary film who have practically no space and audiences are instead getting mediocre franchise blockbuster shoved down their throats.

The de-aging worked well enough even though it was obvious the characters weren't the age they were supposed to be. It worked in the sense that it was believable enough from a ""back then and now"" perspective if you block out the fact that some of them were supposed to be in their 30's in certain scenes. I just imagined they went from men growing old at the start to very old men by the end and took the timeline with some suspension of disbelief. 

The last 20 (give or take a few) minutes were amazing. The way Pesci was shaking and eating without his teeth was super grim and humbling. And De Niro falling over, people looking at him with concern and worry at the bank. And the others dying from prostate cancer, lung cancer and stuff. And of course De Niro trying to make amends with his daughters and planning his own funeral where he doesn't want it to feel so final. So good.",e2149d

Most of his movies aren't just mob crime dramas, that is just the conduit he knows. Most of them are stories about the inner conflicts of Catholic guilt, loyalty, and the human desire for success.

f8v0i5j,"I thought it was fine. Your generic Scorsese crime drama. Overly edited montages that go on forever and rush through decades in a few minutes with little context to fun deep cut music tracks.

At least until the second half when the film reveals it's ace card. This wasn't the movie you thought it was while watching it. That old Scorsese mob magic, that was misdirection. What you're really here for is a trial for the soul. A quiet reflection on the relentless march of age and how it ruins your ambitions and leaves you only with your consequences. 

This film is secretly a clockwork time piece that shockingly gets slower as it goes. The final murder of Hoffa takes ages and for good reason. You realize those old murders meant nothing to Frank the way they meant little to us outside of a visceral thrill. But now it's real. Now he has to betray a friend. 

The real moment I realize what a complete masterpiece this was when Frank's daughter Peggy trully spoke up after so many hours of silence. Before this moment I thought what a waste of a character and a great actress to be so quiet for so long. Then after Hoffa's gone she looks Frank dead in the eyes with one word ""Why?"" 

It's then I realized what she was doing this whole time. She was watching and processing. She was the silent quiet conscious always there to judge and question him because no one else did, not even himself. That why is so devestating in its brevity and placement that it breaks Frank and he is never fixed again. 

Scorsese's point in all this is not to reveal that this old man in a nursing home secretly was behind the death of Jimmy Hoffa. It was to reveal that there is where men who kill Jimmy Hoffa end up. For all the pain they cause others, for all the misery they inflict on the world they end up sad, regretful, and alone. That is the destiny of us all, to watch all we built die off alongside us. So why waste a life on pain? Why? Why? Why?

I think you’re right about that scene symbolized how he’s lonely and a bunch of nurses can’t replace his family who abandoned him, but I think it was also showing that all of this stuff he did in the movie were for nothing and that people don’t even care about Jimmy Hoffa or any of the shit that happened anymore. He’s just some average old guy in a nursing home at that point.",e2149d
fbvc0n6,"Has Scorsese or anyone else explained why they just punted the few known facts surrounding the Hoffa killing?  

1.  The restaurant Hoffa disappears from still physically exists.  The CGI sign actually is pretty close, but the whole surrounding area is very different from actual to movie.  

2.  The house where Hoffa is alleged to be killed is a good 30-45 minutes away in what was then, and now, not a good area.  No one in 75 would think a meeting with higher ups would take place there.  This is particularly problematic when you think that Hoffa set up the meeting location at a high end restaurant in a very high end area. 

The timing gets really screwed up.  You can’t drive by the restaurant and see Hoffa in his car, then drive to the identified house, then check out the house, then return to the restaurant in 10-15 minutes.  It’s 90ish minute job. 

The hole thing has huge timing problems so I was wondering if anyone was saying anything to the effect that “what’s in the book doesn’t really work so we just decided to really change things up so people wouldn’t say we were trying to fool people.”

That would certainly be fair to do under the artistic license umbrella.",e2149d
fckb7mx,"Irishman to me, was a bit underwhelming. It can be summarized quite quicky; If you enjoyed Casino, and Goodfellas, odds are you will enjoy this. It is done in the same form of direction, with the main character giving you a voice over, from the good times, to the eventual breakdowns the life with organized crime brings you. 

Was the film too long? probably. But it didn't seem as long as it was to me. Most scenes also had some meaning to the film. 

The supporting characters were great, and the acting was on par. 

The CGI took me out of the immersion multiple times. Especially when it came to DeNiro. His eyes came off with a fake blue. He walked as if he was 75 even when he was supposed to be, 25-30? In the one scene where he goes and beats up the grocer for pushing his daughter, it's almost unbelievable how weak and frail he looks.  

Overall 7.5/10. No masterpiece, but well done. You really did feel like you were jumping into multiple time lines here. Pacino gives a strong performance, one I haven't seen from him for some time. Supporting cast like Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, and Ray Ramono were great, I wish they were in it more to be honest.",e2149d

fe8xcyr,"Definitely a slow af burn, it can feel a bit aimless at times but most of it is necessary to get all the emotion out of the films final sequences at the end. The final 45 minutes or so, whenever they start planning the murder of Jimmy Hoffa is when the movie gets real good, since before that there was basically no conflict, no danger and everything was going well. The film tells you they all die at the end and I assumed the same would happen to the main char, but he loses everyone and lives out the rest of his days alone, which works better I think. Acting was good, soundtrack was nice and the script is fantastic. I also didn't mind the de-aging CGI.

I'm not sure if I will ever rewatch this film due to how long it is but I'll definitely check out some of Scorsese's other crime films. Very well-made movie.",e2149d

f8vfvjt,"Scorsese has made another masterpiece..... after waiting for it for years and then thinking it would never get made, Im just glad it god made. Ofcourse would have liked to watch it on the big screen, but Im glad this movie exists.

De Niro, Pacino, Pesci are firing on all cylinders in this one and this is the best perfomance these three legends have given in the past 15-20 years. This is a Scorsese mafia movie with his trademarks yet so different from the frentic, energetic showy Goodfellas and Casino, this is much meditative. There are no glories, no good things about being a gangster. De Niro basically made choice very on to enter this life of crime and then follows his orders like a good soldier would do, without happiness or remporse.... he just carries on. Ultimately leading to make a choice between two of his godfathers in Pesci or Pacino and you know this choice will haunt him throughout his life.

The final third act is easily the best of any movies in 2019, it really manages to show us the consequences of their actions and how sadly De Niro will have to live out his remaining days all alone with the consequences, this felt like Marty's farewell to the mafia genre, it might not be but if it is then Im glad this is that movie.

As for some minor criticisms they could have trimmed 10 -15 mins from the runtime, given better role to Anna Paquin playing his daughter,  the digital de-aging is a little rough and takes time getting used to but those are just nitpicks

This is a Scorsese masterpiece and Im glad that he got to make the movie he wanted to.

Other than the CGI, and young Frank walking like he forgot to take the hanger out if his coat, I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially during the last act.

Pesci played a calculating, intelligent mafia boss who just oozed intimidation and Deniro did well with the dumb tough guy routine, but then Deniro was able to say so much without saying anything. Watching him struggle with what the mafia bosses wanted near the end of the film was well done, so much emotion brewing beneath the surface, it was clearly a man torn between worlds, and then to see him make the choice that he did only for the rest of his personal life to crumble in the aftermath is powerful stuff. Not everyone can get on board for a slow burn which is understandable, but if you have the patience the pay off here is very good.",e2149d

fb9x5af,"I really, *really* liked this movie, but I do have some criticisms about it:

* The plot's main issue were incessantly unnecessary. It was basically just a bunch of fucking grown-ass men acting like petulant children that had real guns. ""IT'S MY UNION"" for the 100th fucking time says Jimmy Hoffa, man it got me to the point where I'm sort of glad they off-ed him, but obviously was a bit conflicted given how the film developed that friendship between Frank and Jimmy. I wished there was a better reason carved out as to why Jimmy was being super adamant on the pension funds, rather than let the story pan out as Jimmy living and dying as a stubborn ass.

* The pacing of the ""being brought up to speed"" for the whole story was just everywhere. One minute I'm looking at young Peggy (Frank's daughter), next moment Peggy is now being portrayed by 37 year-old Anna Paquin, and leaving me wondering how come I recognize her and from which film (I looked it up, she was Rogue from the original live-action X-Men series).

* Speaking of X-Men, the de-aging thing was kind of all right, but wasn't nearly as impressive as it was used in X-Men First Class or hell, even that new Will Smith movie that's coming out called Gemini Man or something.

Overall though, I enjoyed the cinematography and the three legendary actors. I certainly liked how the movie took its time and didn't mind being a longer film, but also I'm glad I got to watch it on Netflix, and in the comfort of my own home. It probably would've started becoming uncomfortable to watch at an actual movie theater for me personally.

* One last piece I want to add that I really liked from the film was at the end, how Frank was essentially all alone after all those years of running and gunning for the mob. Every single one of his contacts whether friend or foe were all dead, and he was the last one living. Even his attorney died. It leaves you with that sense of surreal loneliness and pondering what's next, all the while you know you're old as fuck, can't do basic tasks anymore and haven't much time left. The way the film ended the scene with Frank just sitting there with the door slightly crept open was chilling, and it kind of makes you think about death.",e2149d

Even though his arrogance cost Jimmy Hoffa his own life in the end, you can't not be in awe of how ballsy he was. It takes serious guts to talk back to the mob and not be intimidated by them at all.

Even when he was delivering meat at the beginning I thought he was about 45 at least.

Joe Pesci was fcking amazing. It was AWESOME to see him do serious work, I thought he killed it. DeNiro was great as always, but it seems like he has one character and I don't think this strayed at all from a DeNiro character.

It was great seeing so many other actors that aren't huge but fit so well here. Ray Romano was a surprise and I thought he was awesome as well.

Stephen Graham needs more work, I saw him in Boardwalk Empire and love his acting, great guy.

I absolutely loved the car ride scene because you know what is coming but you get pulled into the conversation and the ending is so matter of fact after everything we’ve been through with the characters.

There's 30 seconds of Hoffa explaining to a crowd that just witnessed an apparent assassination attempt that you charge a gun, but run from a knife that was so off tone, slow, repetetive, and pointless, I'm convinced it was adlibbed. 

The film is brimming with scenes, information, and details that are irrelevant to the plot or characters, but feel like they were included because they featured some historically important people?

It really felt like when they were cutting the movie, they just had a lot of great cgi footage and decided it was done already and looked so great they just left it in, even though it was pointless.

The grocer arm-stomping scene just tore me right out of the film. It looks so so weird and terrible I couldn't believe they didn't redo it.

Pesci was particularly phenomenal, and delivered an outstanding performance. I of course love DeNiro and Pacino too, but many of their scenes were clunky either in dialog or pacing even great acting couldn't save it.

I think that De Niro charachter was boring and kinda not that intresting, but De Niro as actor did it good, Joe Pesci was also good.

I had little problem with age diffrence, to me De Niro looked like he has 70 years all the time, i mean the CGI or whatever it was looked slightly weird,  not in a bad way but you could see, it was visible man. Joe Pesci looked old and De Niro aswell his movement was also a bit off, Al Pacino was alright, you could kinda see it but it wasn't that bad, De Niro wasn't that bad either only when they tried to deage him it looked kinda off, i don't wanna talk about it that much because it might sound negative, but you could definetly see it.


The movie itself the way they put it togheter was briliant, a lot of familiar cast from Soprano, Broadwalk Empire and other tv shows.
The first 2 hours went pretty smoothly but than i started to get a bit ''bored'' because it was getting to long but the  i believe after 
De Niro ceremony is when it started to get cool again and the last 30 mintues really blew me away.

f97fg3k,"My review. What a great film! Is it Scorsese's best? No. But still, what a brilliant and amazing piece of movie making.

What I like mostly about it is how he managed to make a mob movie that fits in a ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""The Irishman"" trilogy and yet be completely different from the other two. It has a totally different energy. No ""Gimme Shelter"" on this one. Goodfellas was ""Excess and glamour"", Casino was ""Lust and corrupt power"", and this one is ""Melancholia and arrogance"". Completely different tone, and I LOVE it. It's like he took the 1980 scene from Goodfellas and made a complete opposite. Subdued. Slow. Sad. No cocaine sniffing fast talking violent mobsters. Not glamorizing it. Showing the real side of it: pathetic, shameful, wrong, stupid, unjustified. ""Why?"", she asked. No one asked Henry Hill why, or Nicky Santoro. This movie looks at the violence and crime from these mobsters, immediately reminds is their fate, and show how they were ordinary schmucks who did awful things.

The technical side is competent enough. Great shots and camera work, brilliant editing. The technology to make the actors younger is not quite there, though. Close... but not there. However, I would not do it any other way, it would not work of you cast someone else at the different ages. The movie is driven by this rejuvenating tech gimmick in a way, and it works about 60% of the time.

The acting is top notch, kudos for DeNiro for caring, and Al Pacino... Oh... My God. What a performance. His best since ""Scent of a Woman"" and on par with Dog Day Afternoon and almost getting into Godfather 2 levels. It was that good. He deserves a supporting actor nomination.

I did miss some elements of Hoffa's work to make his pattern and choices more clear, and I wish Harvey Keitel also had a dialogue with Pacino at the award scene, he was misused. I also feel Ray Romano was miscast, but he did his best.

Epic saga, worth every minute. Scorsese did it again.

f97mffv,"I just finished watching the movie and oh my, I enjoyed it so much! At the end I didn’t want it to end already and wanted to see more of Sheeran’s last days/months. My question still is if Peggy ever talked to him after that last scene. Al Pacino did such a great job, he made me laugh many times - especially in that meeting with Tony Pro. 

The last hour when we see Sheeran getting older and his daughters not being there for him, had me doubting if I would do the same thing as them. Like he’s done a lot of bad things, but he’s in his last days, still your father and you won’t be spending any time with him in the future. Really had me thinking what I would’ve done if I were them.

f9iaatp,"I watched this a few days ago and I thought it was another great entry for Scorcese and gangster cinema. I don't think it's quite as good as say Taxi Driver or The Godfather, but it's a great watch nonetheless. For context, I didn't really know anything about Jimmy Hoffa (other than that he disappeared and was rumored to be buried at Giants Stadium) or the real gangsters featured in the film.

What I liked: The three central performances are all really good.  I think Pesci and Pacino are a bit better than De Niro, but that might be because his role was more physical than their's and that's where the age really showed. I liked the way the movie is structured, hopping back and forth in time. I liked the way some side characters were introduced with a card explaining how they died, it really drove home the specter of death over the whole thing. The one sequence in the film that really stood out to me was the one surrounding Hoffa's murder.  The way it repeats shots and the music has mostly cut out is just masterful.

What I didn't like: The seams on the CGI deaging were visible at some points. In particular when more than one of the main trio was onscreen it was more noticeable, and it was always obvious that Frank moved like an old man.  The scene where he beats up the grocer is the most obvious. In addition, the subplot about Frank's daughters just didn't work for me. We didn't get to see enough of him with his family for the scene where his daughter breaks down and tells him how hard it was to live with him to land, and Peggy felt more like a plot device than a character.

Honestly, the length of the movie didn't bother me.  It stretched at some points but by the end of the movie I'd have gladly watched another couple hours of these characters. This would rank just outside of my top 5 for the year, but I think it would be in the 6-10 range. Scorcese is a master and I can't wait for whatever he does next.  It's a 9/10 for me.",e2149d

The Irishman is a long ****ing film and while it's constantly fascinating, at times it feels like it never feels its length yet at the same time I think ""some trimming could've been nice."" Where? Hell if I know.

I think what elevates this film and has a weird poignancy to it is there's this underlying theme of mortality and things ending. Hate to say it but all 4 as in De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and Scorsese are 75-80 years old. Within the next 5 years, we might lose a couple and think the film is not only a good overall movie but a good ender.",e2149d

faee25e,"This film was beautifully somber.

I think the people that dislike this movie were looking for a different kind of gangster film with a faster pace and more boisterous performances. The Irishman doesn't look to glamorize violence, power, money or even loyalty.

The ending of this movie was stunningly sad. I love the way that they didn't seek to inflate Frank's character with the ability to intelligently reflect on his life. He is incapable of expressing the few emotions that he has. Beyond some gut feelings of who he should and should not listen to, Frank doesn't  seem to readily grasp the larger picture. This complements his role as a hitman, as feelings of guilt or remorse rarely penetrate his character.

He's unable to vocalize his opinions. Not because he is afraid or feels it isn't his place, but because he actually lacks the ability to articulate himself well. In the second half of the film, Frank finds it difficult to get through to Hoffa. One could argue that Frank's inability to convince Hoffa of his impending fate is in some way a failure on Frank's part to help one of the few people he truly loves. But if Frank had the type of personality to be able persuade Hoffa, he likely wouldn't have been liked by Hoffa or the mob leaders in the first place. Frank's strength in this world is his ability to execute and his indifference to power. He serves as both a mirror and weapon to those around him. He's smart enough to say yes to the right people and that's it.

Ending the movie with Frank still unknowingly losing control of his life was heart breaking. When the two agents approach him and question him, he immediately asks who did it. They tell him that everyone is dead and that pretty much nothing matters anymore. Frank still doesn't understand. The stuff with the priest was an attempt by Frank to reach a higher, more complex state of emotion, but he even struggled with that. He's desperate to speak to his daughters, but even if they would let him, he wouldn't know what to say.

f8v6ef1,"I saw ‘The Irishman’ two weeks ago and was blown away. I genuinely cannot stop thinking about it, playing particular scenes over again in my head and diving into the rabbit hole of researching more about the real life characters. It was a captivating, enthralling, emotional roller coaster ride and I loved every minute of it. 

I will say the first hour or so is a bit slow, yet still felt condensed and jumped around in an attempt to contextualize Frank Sheeran’s (De Niro) role within the Pennsylvania mob, rising under the wing of boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci). At certain moments, the general vibe of this first act was “Goodfellas-lite,” although it definitely stands apart as it’s own thing. I can see some impatient streaming audiences pausing during this portion and giving up due to it dragging in parts. I would urge them not to do so, however, as the 2nd act kicks the film into hyperdrive as soon as Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) is introduced. 

Everything from then on is utterly fantastic. I was at the edge of my seat, my heart racing as we were subjected to witnessing Hoffa’s downward spiral. I cannot overstate just how great the acting is. Every moment felt like another deck added to a house of cards which will inevitably collapse, the pacing enrapturing you into the story and the cinematography mesmerizing you at every turn. ‘The Irishman’ is truly a beautiful movie. We saw some examples of this in the trailer, but let me tell you, there is so much more for your eyes to appreciate. 

There are tons of scenes I believe will go down as classics from dialogue alone. Hoffa and Tony Pro’s argument over timeliness and implied disrespect is so good. Then the entire Frank Sheeran appreciation night sequence is some of the finest, most intense work of Scorsese’s career. While the violence is restrained and sometimes implied rather than shown in graphic detail, fans will enjoy no shortage of “house painting.” One of the opening scenes defines the mafia slang without needing to verbalize a thing. Pure, raw emotion is this film’s most powerful tool though and the third act absolutely crushed me. The long hug between Sheeran and Hoffa in the backseat of the car as the latter was driven to his death broke my heart, as did Sheeran’s miserable attempt to compose himself on the phone with Hoffa’s wife. Then his end as a lonely, hated man, deteriorating alone in a nursing home. That final shot where the priest tells Sheeran he’ll be back after Christmas and he replies he’s not going anywhere? It’s not said in the film, but the real Frank Sheeran died 2 weeks before Christmas 2003. I genuinely teared up in some of these parts. 

I disagree with the major complaints I’ve read from critics. The digital de-aging is nearly flawless. There were only a handful of scenes where I actually noticed a subtle “uncanny valley” effect. Pesci leaning over the hood of the truck, De Niro sitting in the car talking to Bobby Cannavale, De Niro talking in the office with Romano and the CGI flag scene. These were only brief seconds of the 229 minute film, which I would characterize as too *short* if I had to complain about the length! There was so much going on, so much information to digest and process, yet I still left the theater feeling as if there were crucial pieces of the story missing. I mean that in a positive sense. I enjoyed the story so much, I wanted more. Maybe this is because I read I Heard You Paint Houses beforehand, so I know there is in fact more to tell, but Scorsese could’ve released a 5 hour version of ‘The Irishman’ and I’d be all over it. 

Overall I’d say instant classic and masterpiece are two words that aptly describe ‘The Irishman.’ I can’t wait to watch it all over again on Netflix.",e2149d

And finally, it’s so good to see all these legends bring their A game.

In that interview that came out with deniro and Pacino they said how after the Righteous Kill premiere they knew the movie wasn’t good at all. That it felt like something they weren’t truly proud of.

I'm seeing a lot of people here saying it sucked, which kind of makes me laugh thinking of people who sat through an entire 3.5 hour movie just to come out of it thinking it sucks. I think the first half was slow, but the second half really worked for me, especially when it became less flashbacks dubbed with narration and more actual dialogue. It's really interesting to see Deniro play this kind of roll though. Sure, he plays gangsters a bunch, but as far as I've seen, he hasn't played someone who seems kind of timid or reserved and stumbles over his words before. He wasn't really a high up crime boss, but a guy who was just a well liked and trusted worker in that gang. That's a depressing ending though and my final take away is that I never want to be old, and I especially never want to be old and hated.",e2149d

An aging filmmaker (and his aging actors) reflecting on the genre and themes that brought them to where they are today. There is no glamorizing of the lifestyle, no real tongue in cheek humor to be found. Like Frank, the entire film feels cold and somewhat empty, similar to the final episodes of The Sopranos.

f99ipsw,"This movie was really long. It was also really good. A life without introspection is not worth living. Frank never had any self reflection, or sense of morality. This makes for a very tragic and depressing character. 

I found myself rooting for Hoffa. But it’s not like he was a good person either. Both his ego, and the mafias ego led to both of their downfalls. 

Franks relationship with his daughter was done really well imo. She never found forgiveness, and I don’t blame her. Frank couldn’t even forgive himself because he had no sense of morality. In the end, he was just a pawn, and there is a certain sadness in following the life of a pawn. Most mob movies follow the king..

I loved how Frank payed his price for loyalty to the mafia by loosing his family, I was eager to see Steven Grahams character and he was very much worth the wait, him and Pacino had my favourite interactions of on screen characters this year and holy mother of god the final shot is burned into my mind. Frank in deaths doorway. My favourite scenes were ""Im sit-in the back! You sit in the front"" with Sally bugs, the look of anger on Franks face, and Franks confession to the priest was my favourite De Niro moment out of all his films, I loved Pesci and everything, its no Goodfellas or Casino, I also loved the soundtrack and the script.

A sad abysmal end to a glamorous lifestyle, probably the most somber endings to any Scorsese film, the final 35 minutes were painful to watch.",e2149d
f91xta1,I enjoyed it. The ending made me feel so bad and lonely after what it all came down to.,e2149d
f928s2t,"I thoroughly enjoyed that film.

I have two gripes about it, though.  

My first gripe is with one scene in particular with the de-aging tech, and that is when De Niro fucked up the grocery clerk for pushing his daughter.  You could blatantly tell it was an 76 year old man kicking the grocer.  That is my only real gripe with the de-aging.

My second gripe is the almost free-form nature of the film.  It is super loose.  And I am not even sure I can call it a gripe.  I feel like any story involving Jimmy Hoffa is going to suffer from this problem.  For instance, while it has been a while since I have seen Hoffa, I remember it being rather free-form as well.  It could also be a problem of Scorsese's last movie being Silence, which did not require a tighter story, as the motion picture focused on more on the philosophies of faith.  I am not sure.  But I certainly felt like this movie could have been tighter.

However, both of these relatively small complaints I can completely overlook simply because of Pesci.  I have heard so much Oscar buzz over De Niro and Pacino, but there was not a character on that screen that I held onto every word they said quite like I did with Pesci as Bufalino.  Even in serious roles like With Honors, Pesci always had his quirky and even manic side to everything, but damn if he didn't portray true evil in this movie.  In Casino, he crushes a man's head in a vice, but still, that moment in not even as close to as sinister as Pesci was in this movie.  Even the psychopathic, and completely sociopathic Tommy from Goodfellas is not even close to his screen gravitas in The Irishman.

Sorry, critics, Joe Pesci held this film together on his back.  Not discounting the hell that Marty and De Niro went through to make this, but damn did Pesci give his career best performance.",e2149d

f94x169,"The runtime made me feel like it was a director's cut and scorsese thought no part was so unimportant to require a cut to meet the maximum theatrical release length. If you're going to have Pacino, De Niro, and Pesci all in the same film, you go big or you go home. It's as simple as that. Funny enough, Scorsese went big and he went home. I saw it over the last 2 days with my dad.

It was a bit hard for me to follow at times, not because it was confusing, but I was waiting for it to focus on the story in a way that is regular for an audience member. But it's not that. The story is the inner ramblings of an old man with a life to confess, whose actions and the consequences he received are still rattling in an effort to culminate into some form of wisdom or comprehension, so it's going to be scattered. But he's not a smart character. He's a loyal follower, and in the end, a follower without a leader. It's an interesting take. It's what he wishes that he could tell his daughter. Talk to an old man or old woman sometime. It's like that. It's a challenge to watch, so you might need some coffee.

Performances were great all around. It never clichés for his daughter. She reacts how many normal frightened people would react. It's quite grounded. The film demands that you read between the lines with the simple, the implied, and the silent. She is silent because he never talked to her. He never understood her, how she thought, or what she thought.

I love the ending. Why does he leave the door cracked? Is he waiting for his daughter? Death? Anyone? How lonely he must feel, how unimportant. He probably relishes in being a burden so that he at least has interactions with people. But how powerless he must feel for being a gangster without a gang, never truly having goals of his own, and going with the flow of whatever life brought him until he had nothing left well before death. He bought the brightest, most obviously ""Irish"" coffin, hoping that he would have a funeral and be remembered, but he realizes that hes not even worth remembering, worse than Hoffa. So, perhaps he wants the funeral so that his daughter will attend. Perhaps he wants the plot in the mausoleum in case she wants to visit him there later, if she doesn't go to the funeral. Again, it's the things that are not said which are important.

It's a powerful film. It's easy to get pissed off watching this because it's different, but it's not The Last Jedi. It's a worthy challenge. I'll watch it again one day.",e2149d

For the people who complain that it's too long, I thought it would've been better as a six-part miniseries, but that probably didn't appeal to the filmmaker in Marty. The whole award ceremony scene would've made for a wonderful hour of television. 

The CGI wasn't as distracting as I thought it would be, granted DeNiro's blue eyes really made be glad HBO didn't CGI Emilia Clarke's eyes purple for Thrones. If anything the old man makeup on Dom was more distracting. No offense to Dom Lombardozzi, who was good, but Dom is Dom in every role he plays & even under all that old man makeup all I could see was him. Couldn't stop thinking that James Gandolfini probably would've been cast as Fat Tony Salerno if he were still alive. Only thing that could've made this better.

Van Zandt & Norton cameos were nice. Sebastian's was a miss for me. His acting was good, but I just saw him not the character so took me out a bit. My fault, not his. Fat Damon was Fat Damon. Ray Ramono's second collaboration with Scorsese! Also liked him in Vinyl.

Stephen Graham is cot damn treasure and needs to be in more mainstream productions!

The scenes with Harvey Keitel, Pesci & Cannavale make me want an HBO spinoff series about the Philly mob during the 60s-80s. Would be so good! Speaking of HBO gangster shows, as a huge Boardwalk Empire fan it was nice to see Jack Huston (Richard Harrow) as Bawbby Kennedy & Aleksa Palladino.

f94p42v,"watched it the very night it came out on Netflix and had a few days to think of it...

overall, absolutely loved it. one of the most sprawling and interesting crime epics I've seen. perhaps the most engrossing or best paced 3+ hour film I've seen. 

start to finish I'd say best word that I felt every minute was fascinating.

loved the overall plot. found most of the acting to be captivating. I went blind enough into the movie (and the plot... I knew the basics but I'm not American so maybe the inevitable conclusion was not very clear to me) that I found the plot itself captivating.

a lot of the movie to me, however, was captivating in the way the prison cooking scene in Goodfellas was. the simple things... like slicing garlic or what makes the best sauce. I thought this film well balanced moving along the plot with scenes that paused the plot to develop both characters or -- like the prison cooking scene in Goodfellas -- just sort of appreciate 'craft' ... the way these people did things. Almost like a tiny homage to how pasta sauce should be made lol. I felt The Irishman really offered a number of small captivating scenes like these. 

I also loved the odd humour (the one character bio of what happened to ppl, I""m sure everyone laughed at the same one) or I liked the cameos, too (e.g. the singer at the event/party scene near the end of the film).

I do, however, admit that I think so much of the little things I appreciate would likely be lost on a lot of people. I want to re-watch it over Christmas with my family but I know they may not appreciate a lot of those things.

But at least for me who grew up watching (and has spent a couple decades with their scenes stewing in my mind), I loved the overall balance of scenes: the plot development, the character development, the small homage scenes to craft, the references or the cameos. 

I thought they all combined to make every minute purposeful and captivating.",e2149d

f95jdcs,"The CGI wasn't bad on it's own, althought no one ever looked like in their 30s and they all moved and sounded like 70 year old men. The couple of ""fight scenes"" were especially goofy. It's a pretty by the numbers Scorsese movie for like 3 hours and the last half hour or so are phenomenal. The entire final section about old age blew me away, some serious Synecdoche New York vibes. It helped that people finally looked natural. It's an amazing finale, it's like a coronation of all Scorsese's gangster movies. I thought Joe Pesci and Al Pacino were fucking fantastic and overshadowing DeNiro throughout the movie but he made it up during that section, one of his all time greatest perfomences. I wish this part lasted more because i was kind of bored watching the by the numbers crime story for 3 hours, i watched Casino,Goodfellas and Mean Street before so fuck me for that i guess. Overall it's like an 8/10, 3 hours of it were a 6 and then finale was a 10.",e2149d

I even think DeNiro is in the room at the same time.

I loved this little nod. The idea that these two epic stories were unfolding AT THE SAME TIME, across different parts of the US, and they're all interconnected by criminality and gangster familties and such.

Of course, all these events are based on 'real life' so I guess the real world is the MSCU, Martin Scorsese Cinematic Universe...",e2149d

fedzjm1,"*May contain spoilers depending on your definition. Long story short, don't read reviews if you really don't want spoilers eh?*

*My god* was this boring. I was reading through the other comments for other takes on this. But damn, even the talk surrounding this film is boring. The few things I can remember or be reminded of weren't interesting at all. In general, what I remember is that this film is sort of just a tribute to all the mafioso tropes we've seen a hundred times, yet done in the least interesting ways possible. Yeah I get that Frank hurts people around him by being ""part of the life"" - seen it before, seen it done *much* better - heck, probably even by the same actor... Yeah I get that he dies alone because of how he lived. Seen it before, seen it done better... I've seen the ""big assassination"" done better and I've seen mafia life depicted at least more entertainingly... I've not even watched many Mafioso films and still all these plot points and subjects seem as tired and old as the director/actors who are doing them.

The only part I thought was almost interested in is the daughter relationship, but again, I've seen it before, and after being stretched over a ridiculous 3 and a half hours (it's unfortunate that I had no idea how long this film was before it was over - the last 30-45 minutes I was questioning my own sanity and whether a film with Robert Deniro could really still be going this long), it ultimately made up at most 10 minutes of the runtime and turned out to be weak as hell. Again, seen such subject matter handled better... literally any time it has been handled. 

Was it deliberately being slow and boring for artistic effect? If so, I just didn't feel it. I can only even remember parts of the film by reading through other comments referencing them, because really nothing stands out. And even after being reminded of them and being able to remember the scenes fairly well, I can see why I forgot them. I've never watched The Godfather, sue me, nor the Goodfellas. I think I must have watched Casino once when I was a teen, and I can at least remember two scenes well from that. Scarface I've watched only twice, and not for a long time again still, yet I can remember the majority of that. The point being, that it wouldn't hurt to at least have something exciting happen or a scene or two that's worth remembering. It really makes all the difference on the impact a film has, or at least the chance that I'll ever want to sit through 3⅟2 hours of one again. Honestly, I wish the legends behind it all the luck in the world in winning an Oscar, as despite not thinking the film is worth it, I do sadly think it's proof that they won't get another shot.",e2149d

f8vxat4,"I absolutely loved it. It isn’t for everyone, which isn’t a slight against differing tastes, but if you’re expecting anything like Goodfellas, you might be disappointed. It’s a tale of morality, consequences, and age. The three and a half hour running time is mildly intimidating, but it’s used efficiently, nothing feels wasted. Every bit of acting is brilliant and Scorsese, at least in my mind, continues to cement himself as the greatest director of all-time. The reflective nature of the ending is probably the best part of the movie and is just as thought provoking and profound as it’s cracked up to be. 10/10, personally.",e2149d

Maybe that, or maybe I just wanted to continue knowing this characters and the time is just not enough, specially for the non-protagonists (I still can't believe Peggy has like 2 lines of dialogue).",e2149d

f8yr29c,Overall I thought this was an incredible movie. It’s the opposite of GoodFellas and Casino but in a good. Scorsese does his best to not glamorize these guys and this movie is very meditative and it truly shows the emptiness of the gangster lifestyle. We’ve had other gangster movies like this with Once Upon a Time in America and The Godfather Part 3 but I think The Irishman is much better than those movies in almost every way. This movie truly comes together in the last hour and the scene where they’re all at the party is probably the best scene of the year. If you give this movie your full attention for 3 1/2 hours and don’t expect a “fun” gangster movie then you’ll see how powerful this movie is.,e2149d

I read the book and watched the film at the cinema and then on Netflix and I have to say he nailed the character.

What do people expect Sheeran to be like? He admits himself he was quiet.

Deniro’s performance compliments the other characters that orbit him perfectly. Pacino as Hoffa is big and boisterous (an Oscar contender for sure) and Pesci is the complete opposite but still a powerhouse (another Oscar contender).",e2149d
f929gqv,"I'm assuming De Niro staring directly into the camera 3 or 4 times in a row (during his scene with Pesci where he's being told he has to kill Hoffa) was intentional. If so, what was his 4th-wall-breaching meant to signify?",e2149d
f92buex,"Was Sally Bugs supposed to kill Frank Sheeran or why was he so upset about the wet spot in the back row? He even asked the son of Hoffa and driver several times (telling Frank indirectly: If I'm supposed to explain this to somebody; like whom? Tony Pro?).

I've heard people call it an eulogy for an era of filmmaking and it really does feel like a coda to that particular Scorsese gritty crime drama. Like Eastwood using Unforgiven as his final word on a genre that defined much of his career. 
 
If there is a weak spot to this movie, it is how they portray DeNiro's character. The de-aging is noticeable. It never really took me out of the film, but it might have been a better decision to have two different actors share the role. Like maybe have DiCaprio and DeNiro, his two leading men, share it.

How he’d just sit there with little dialogue in the meeting scenes with an unreadable expression on his face. Loved it.

When Sally Bugs was looking at Jimmy with a weird look and said: ""I can't see nothing."", what he really meant was he was looking at a dead person.

f8vh296,"I saw this in the theater and am rewatching it on Netflix now. My thoughts:

Definitely the best Scorsese movie since Goodfellas. The de-aging CGI that was everyone’s concern is mostly forgotten after the first 10 minutes. The only real time it’s noticeable is when Frank (Deniro) is kicking the grocery store owner. He still moves like an old man. The music is of course top notch, typical Scorsese. 

I had read the book a few months back, and the book is outstanding. I was a little disappointed that they largely left out the mafia being involved in “Dallas”. It’s only hinted at during the Frank Sheeran Appreciation Dinner. And they completely left out Frank’s involvement in it. But I get it, people are tired of Kennedy conspiracies and it’s not what the movie is really supposed to be about. 

The costumes were, I think, one of the best parts of the movie. I didn’t see anyone else mention it, but Frank in the nursing home, wearing the white button down with a black vest is exactly what Sheeran wore, and a picture of him wearing that exact outfit is included in the book: https://i.imgur.com/2rEsG0r.jpg",e2149d

fcpcxmx,"I think time will not be kind to this movie. It has very good parts and a good editor could make a great cut of it, but it's kinda clunky as-is. So much hype for De Niro, but he moves like a ghoul and sucks all the energy out of any kinetic scenes. Pacino by comparison has a real fire behind his eyes and steals every scene he's in. Unfortunately, he's in maybe a third of the movie, while De Niro is in nearly every shot.

Which editor OK'd that long sequence where Frank has to be the middle man in a dispute between Jimmy and Tony? It repeats itself 4 times and is indefensibly boring and redundant. It's 40 minutes of **""Frank, tell Tony I'm not talking to him!"" - ""Frank, tell Jimmy he's being really immature!""**",e2149d

It was fatalistic to the extreme.  It didn’t feel like anyone was making a choice as much as locked in to their destiny - they even had the dates and method of death subtitles for marginal characters.

It watches like Scorsese gave Charlie Kaufman the final edit on the screenplay.  Solemn and lonely for a gangster film. It was original and holds its own as a great film and it wasn’t Goodfellas 2 (thank god).",e2149d

f98s4qf,"This movie was phenomenal. Some of my favorite moments:

-“What kind of man makes a phone call like that?” Frank talking about how he called Jimmy’s wife after he killed him. Which by the way was an incredible scene by De Niro. He was trying to give Jimmy’s wife any sliver of hope although he knew the dark truth. It was also interesting how when he said he hadn’t called Jimmy’s wife yet Peggy immediately knew her father had something to do with the death of her favorite “Uncle”

-Frank going through this whole process of picking the right guns for the job and explaining the reasons why you should go into the bathroom before killing someone in a diner exemplify his growth into a master hit-man. Yet he still had the “fuck-it”mentality and just wanted to get it over with in that particular moment so followed none of his own advice.

-The subtleness of Scorsese: Before Jimmy gets shot at in the court house there were two or three people from the audience who got up and left the room so it was surprising when the last guy didn’t turn to go out and came straight up to Jimmy to try to shoot him. Was it a film tactic to surprise the real audience or a mobster move to distract any guards in the courthouse? Either way it worked.",e2149d

When Frank meets Russell for the first time he looked a little cartoonish but then I got used to it, I couldnt tell if how much de-aging they did on Pesci and Pacino looked like a short haired version of himself from Scent of a Woman. Pesci really made the movie for me really calm, never raises his voice and he was terrifying but in a good way. The little blurbs that flashes with certain people in movie I liked a lot because it gave weight to the guys Frank meets throughout his life. DeNiro did his usual tired old man act but it works because Frank was a old and tired. Pacino was great as Jim Hoffa and jail scene with Tony Pro was hilarious and Pesci was the friend of ours I didnt know I needed lol. 8/10",e2149d

f8xsgls,"I'm really surprised many are criticizing the cgi, for me I thought no matter how good it's gonna be it'll be a distraction but I didn't pay attention to it for most of the movie (except for the grocer scene, that was horrible)

I was invested in the story for the entire runtime of the movie
The performances are great, Pesci shines in very different role from his other Scorsese contributions, De Niro gave an amazing restraint performance especially in the final more or less 45 minutes but it was Pacino who stole the show.. Wow what a performance, I know Brad Pitt will most likely win best supporting actor in the oscars but imo Pacino deserves it

And judging by the comments section it seems like I'm among the rare people agreeing with the early claims that this is a masterpiece, one of Scorsese's finest works",e2149d
f8y6x8x,"My initiatial reaction is that this was a good film, but not without flaws.

Mainly, I think at least 30 minutes of this film wasn't necessary, especially a lot of scenes before Hoffa. To me, Hoffa and Bufalino's conflict was the most interesting aspect of the film, as well as Frank Sheeran's life after killing Hoffa. I can appreciate building the context and the characters, but I have to admit that during the first hour of the film I was slightly losing interest. IMO, this movie could have been three hours or possibly even two hours and forty minutes and it'd be arguably better.

In addition, Robert De Niro looked so old despite having a CGI face. The way De Niro moved during the entire film, I think it was painfully obvious that it was an old man acting, not a young man. I have no problem with the cast, since all three of De Niro/Pacino/Pesci were fantastic, but I do wonder if a younger cast could have done as well as these three did. Maybe (randomly throwing out names) Christian Bale as Frank Sheeran, DiCaprio as Hoffa, and...I don't know anyone who could have done Bufalino as well as Pesci did, that's for sure. 

With that said, what a fantastic performance from De Niro/Pacino/Pesci, especially Pacino and Pesci. The entire sequence starting from Pacino approaching the car to being killed in the house was terrifying. I think Pacino's Hoffa was already suspecting that something was going to happen before entering the car, but he decided to trust De Niro's Sheeran and still went with him. Joe Pesci has been retired for how many years, and I thought he was the most terrifying person in that film.

In addition, I love the fact that there was no score for the entire last hour of the film. It's a clear message that being a gangster may be glamorous, but as Frank Sheeran said in the end, we all have an expiry date. 

The ending of the film was gut-wrenching, too. Frank Sheeran purchasing his own coffin, choosing his own grave (call back to how he forced two other enemy soldiers to dig their own graves when he was in the war), being ghosted by his daughters, etc. In the end, it's nothing. I don't know if the real Frank Sheeran felt this way, but damn. That ending was genuinely hard to watch (in a good way).

This is a solid 4/5 film for me.",e2149d
f8zjztc,Found it interesting how frank said he didn’t want to be cremated or to be buried underground because it’s too “final”. then at the end of the movie he tells the priest to leave his door open a crack.,e2149d

Run-time is a bit long yes, but it's Netflix...so take a couple breaks.",e2149d

f98fe37,Does anyone else feel Harvey Keitel was underused? He should have definitely done more in this film.,e2149d
f9ap1hp,"I think it really shows the talent that was involved in the making of this movie, since three hours literally just flew by. Movie just kept on going steadily and somehow miraculously didn't get boring even once during it's length. At the same time though, I feel like I've already forgotten about 90 percent of the movie and I saw it last night @_@ 

It was like watching a documentary and there was a movie hidden inside it. And then during the final 30 minutes the movie turned into a more traditional drama, about an elderly mob hitman trying to reconnect with his children -> I really liked this part and I would've been glad if there was even more of it. Even if it meant sacrificing some of the other stuff.

Pacino pretty much stole the whole movie. He was just way too much fun, with his ice creams and calling everyone cocksuckers. Pesci was alright, he just had a weird habit of looking dead during some scenes.

De Niro was the weakest link for me. He did do fine job, but the de-ageing stuff just didn't work at all, he looked like an old man throughout the whole movie. It was jarring when Pesci's character sometimes called him ""a kid"" and he's sitting there looking like a 60-year old at least. And it was difficult to know what year is it supposed to be in this scene, how old is De Niro supposed to be during this part when he looks the same all the time? Would've preferred a younger actor for those scenes and then just switch it to De Niro when he's elderly or something. Because at one point De Niro beats up a guy on the street and he looks like he's about to fall over and break his hip (also those kicks looked really weak).

There were points where it felt like they were trying to recreate the ""Funny how?"" scene from Goodfellas. Don't know, probably wasn't even their intention, but they didn't come even close anyway. In fact I thought the whole movie was rather tensionless, which was rather strange and I don't know why. After all, this IS a gangster movie, you'd think these guys would be intimidating as hell.

I'll rate it 7/10. Good movie, but... eeehh... whatever. Recommendation as well.",e2149d
f9blpo1,"My favorite thing about the Irishman is that despite its length, it captures the ephemeral nature of a mobster life in contrast with his family relationships. In the end, DeNiro is paying the emotional price for treating his family like an afterthought. When the FBI is trying to get him to talk about Hoffa at the end by pointing out that he has nobody left to protect, he brushes that off because the reality that he spent his life putting insufficient effort into his more meaningful relationships is too hard for him to come to grips with.",e2149d

f9rc8ru,"Incredibly flawed but ultimately good movie. I just never believed for a single second that De Niro was muscle or a hitman because he just carries himself like a 75 year old and there's really no changing that. He looked weird and old and it nearly ruined the movie for me, just incredibly miscast. Either cast another actor entirely or at least a younger actor for the majority of the movie(with De Niro narrating) until you get the the jail/nursing home in the last 30 minutes because that's where De Niro really shines. The other actors I didn't mind as much because they fit the roles a bit better and they were supposed to be older than De Niro anyway. 

Still though, I had real trouble discerning in some scenes that time had passed or what year we were supposed to be in since it jumped around a bit. All of the sudden the kids are adults but all of our other actors look the same pretty much so I it took me a couple of scenes to realize it had jumped ahead. This is also maybe the one Scorsese movie that I felt we didn't really need a lot of the minor characters and they really didn't add much to the movie. The wives were really underwritten and just kind of non-existent for most of the movie. Give us a couple of scene about how they are feeling about what's happening or make them even less a part but what we get is just them eating screen time in the first half for no payoff in the second half. Same thing with Harvey Keitel and Bobby Cannavale, great actors but completely unmemorable characters with no payoff or really reason to be in the movie.  

 I almost turned it off in the first half it was so all over the place but the second half really picked up. Really enjoyed Pacino as Hoffa. All his scenes stand out and just a really well written and acted part. Charming, intelligent, charismatic while also being a stubborn, scumbag, criminal. A new twist on the Scorsese archetype of this time bomb character who just keeps pushing and pushing until they blow up like Johnny Boy in Mean Streets or Pesci's character in Goodfellas. Pesci was good too. A role we haven't really seen from him, just kind of cool and collected and in charge. Stephen Graham
was also really great and I hope he gets some bigger parts in other stuff because of this. 

The last 30 minutes or so were really the best part. Just the slow decent into old age. The loss of everyone and everything, the loneliness and sadness, just brutal. 

Overall I liked it, definitely worth the watch but just some major flaws that didn't have to be there.",e2149d
f8xg55d,"At 37:11 left in the film, did anyone notice a really strange and out of place cut. When Frank calls Jo after Hoffa being killed, he starts his line, it skips, cuts and he repeats his line.

However, I’m still a little skeptical because of that notoriously bad cut in the beginning of Casino before DeNiro is blown up in the car.",e2149d

Also, iirc right before this, Frank delivered some weapons to ""big ears"" for the Cuba resistance ? But then the resistance failed ? It was also revealed that he was an ex CIA agent, so maybe he.. I don't know, didnt really delivered the weapons to Cuba ? I don't quite understand his role in this.

I'd mention that I also watched Gangs of New York and the Departed back to back before jumping straight into the Irishman, so i'd still  say that I probably love those two films a bit more than this one, but the Irishman is still without a doubt in the top 5-10 films of the year for me and has some career best performances from De Niro, Pacino and Pesci with great ensemble performances  from top to bottom.

The multi-layered story telling from many points in one man's life is awesome!

Also, the mob story itsself, is just as rich as the other movies..at least this go-a-round for me.. Again, if you aren't a 60-70 year old white dude, you should research things like the Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa's, Unions in the 20th century, and mostly Racketeering.

My biggest gripe is that Scorcesse went with CGI when depicting violence..He did much better with traditional makeup. It doesn't ruin the movie by any means, it's just a blemish on a well crafted film.

The story is told linearly, but by one character, that exists in four different timelines. The subject is this characters assessment, rather than reality(for better or worse)..I love thoughtful writing like this!

The pacing was well done but I could see the non linear structure feeling a bit choppy for some folks.  Given all that's going on I never felt overwhelmed or that I was underserved any information that I would need to follow the plot. 

Cinematography was great as well.  Veteran work is what I call it - you may not have a shot or elaborate set ups that blow you away but it's all still A+.

I would say out of the 5 films I've seen this year this is a close second to Parasite.  Knives Out third with Once Upon A Time and Endgame taking the last two.  I plan to see Ford v Ferrari and Uncut Gems in Dec so looking forward to seeing how those stack up.


Also, this film finally made me declare Pacino as the greatest actor of all time (for me personally at least).",e2149d
f9kemyj,"Unpopular opinion but i thought this movie was fine just fine....it was too long and could have easily been edited down by about an hour at least....the de-aging performances didn't really land well but besides that i thought everyone did very well, especially Pacino and Pesci....All in All id prob put it arpund Casino or The Aviator level in Scorcese's filmography def not as good as Goodfellas or The Departed but it deserves its place in his top 5 for sure.",e2149d
f9ki0by,"I liked it. Thought the story was good, the performances were very good and it kept me interested and entertained throughout. My biggest problem was with the de-aging, I didn't feel that it was believable at all. Seeing Robert de Niro supposed to be in his 30s yet walking around like a man in his 70s kind of broke my immersion, in particular was the scene  where he beats up that shop owner - the kicks and stomps he does look limp and stiff. The character is supposed to be this hard man who everyone's afraid of yet you never really felt the physical menace because the character looked and moved like an old man.

fai6zsh,"It took me two days to watch it, but that’s the advantage of putting a long movie on Netflix, you can watch it at your leisure. 

I thought it was pretty damn fantastic. With the exception of a few scenes, it didn’t feel long. I love a good history, and few tell stories as well as the master, Marty. 

I felt like Pesci knocked it out of the park. After being retired it’s impressive that he jumped back in and was so strong. Everyone in it was fantastic. There is the question of should the younger characters have been played by younger actors? Yeah, I guess they could, but my buddy brought up a good point that you’re watching the movie for the stars. 

I feel like since Mean Streets Marty finally shows you what the mob was. They were crooks and murderers. It wasn’t glamorous in the way Goodfellas came off, and it showed you how you ended up after being in the mob. You were killed, or you died/ lived the rest of your days alone. 

My only two gripes were old man DeNiro beating up the grocery clerk- it looked really odd. And the makeup on Fat Tony Salerno looked way off. I didn’t really mind the CGI and young guy makeup, but Fat Tony looked bad. 

Overall, thought it was a solid movie, and I’m sure this group was happy the film got made and released. Good stuff.",e2149d
f93v8tx,"Of the big 3, Al Pacino just blew me away. What incredible acting. For not one second did I think he was acting.

fcgv4zk,"The Irishman was a good movie. Those who say otherwise only expected action, gunshots and killings, like the other movies some listed as ""Best of Scorsese"".

It was different than other gangster movies because it showed the sad, lonely end of the gangster. And it was the first movie I've seen about the mafia that did not end with violence.

It was long for 3 reasons: the sum of all scenes with him and Russ and their wives, the long scene that ended with the most important task of Frank and then his last, peaceful years.

And all of those reasons were needed to be able to empathize with Frank. They were all needed so the viewer could feel something at the end of the movie. This gangster movie also had an artistic part, and that is good.",e2149d

f92hydk,"This movie was absolutely phenomenal; but really what more could you expect by a Marty film? Deniro, Pesci, and Pacino were nothing but stellar. 

I loved how it was produced, it was biographical and it felt like Frank was sitting there with you, and he was telling you about his life. It was very personal, as he recounted the hits and life he lived; and loved Jimmy's affinity for ice cream. Seemed like every time he was in picture he was gorging himself with ice cream. 

The scene where he's going to pull off a hit, and hes in his room with his guns trying to figure out which one he is gonna take, and hes like ""You don't want this because it'll make too much noise, a patrol car can hear it blocks away, but you want to make noise so people run away and won't be looking at you"" and then he picks his guns, its almost so casual as hes describing the process its like he's choosing which socks he should wear today or what he should have for breakfast.

f9vxm9a,"Above avarage but nothing special (this probably applies to most netflix movies). As an European I feel like I'm missing lots of US history and I have no connection to any of these events so that's why I might not like the movie as much. It feels like it's all over the place throwing names and introducing new characters out of nowhere and I was lost several times (""Wait, who is this guy again?"", why are they there etc.). Also, my biggest issue - De Niro's eyes and the CGI in general. Goddamnit, the effects looked so bad, so artificial I couldn't focus on the dialogue in some scenes. He looks like an android, someone straight out of cyberpunk. I have no idea why they didn't fix it with some CGI or just leave his natural eyes.",e2149d

f94tww4,"Probably going to be downvoted but I kind of wish they just made this a “Hoffa” movie while making Frank a side character. I know Frank is suppose to be a more reserved character who takes the orders, but Pacino just commands every scene he shares with De Niro to the point where I forgot Frank was even in the same room as Hoffa. There are some moments where he is likable, but I found it hard to care about Frank throughout most of the movie.",e2149d

I can’t put my finger on why this didn’t resonate more with me. Maybe it’s because I’m reaching middle age and it made me aware of my mortality and my flaws in ways that made me feel uncomfortable.

One other point: I’m a bit of an art history buff and noticed a couple of the paintings on walls in the film. I’m sure the painting in the kitchen was by Albert Bierstadt, who was an American landscape artist. I also noticed Leutze’s *George Washington Crossing the Delaware*. I felt Scorsese probably used these romantic and idealized visions of America to contrast with the dark mafia underworld that exists there.",e2149d

f92wivg,"I may be overreacting and exhibiting a bit of recency bias here, but for me this film is a Scorsese masterpiece that will age very well and go down as one of the greats. The final hour or so really elevates it into something much more profound than your usual gangster fare. Man, that final half hour really hits hard and makes you appreciate the preciousness of life! 

So many great scenes and sequences to mention. The celebration dinner scene is a real standout for me - all of the looks given between the characters and the conversations getting increasingly more desperate and ominous (""It's what it is""; ""They wouldn't dare""). Some great comedic sequences like the ""this is how I'll tell him what I think of his offer"" part and the Hoffa/Tony Pro sit-down. And wow, the long drawn-out build-up to the Hoffa hit was unbearable. From the moment the flashbacks converge with the road trip timeline it's just a masterful cranking up of tension. The phone call to Hoffa at the lake; the moment Russell tells Frank what's going to happen while making a salad; the plane ride; the car journey to the house and back to pick up Hoffa and back to the house again (complete with hilariously mundane and awkward but somehow sinister fish chat); culminating in the hit itself which was suitably to-the-point... I think I'm right in saying that the entire sequence plays out with no music at all and it must be at least 30 minutes long in total. After that we get a fantastic montage of sorts that wraps things up leading into the final heartbreaking half hour. The theme music from Robbie Robertson during the montage is fantastic - I love the ominous strings and harmonica, and the car wash shot is just delicious.

Some minor negatives. The pacing sags a little in the middle third, but overall I thought the editing and flow was excellent and it didn't feel like 3.5 hours at all. I agree with everyone saying the de-aging is off-putting at first but you soon get used to it. That first scene with Pesci and De Niro standing in front of the truck looked like a pair of bobble-head toys! And yes the grocery shop fight scene was pretty awful... surely they could have put De Niro's head on to a younger body for that part. I did appreciate the quick brutality of the hit scenes, but is it just me or are good old-fashioned squibs far more effective at depicting gunshots than the CGI blood spurts we seem to get everywhere these days?

Overall I absolutely loved it, and I'm very glad it's on Netflix so I don't have to wait an age before watching it again! 9.8/10",e2149d

I have watched every quality mafia related movie/series and it goes to top with likes of Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface.

To me it's like Norman Rockwell's Jungian Shadow. American through another lens.

The inner turmoil and guilt of the main POV was what maked the movie for me. I found it great that De Niro's character's philosphy of ""I am just following orders"" turns out the way it did - the character has nothing to live for and for all he has done - is forgotten.",e2149d

f97cb2i,"There is a lot to say about the Irishman. My take is that it was two very different movies thematically one after the other. The first two and a half hours, to be honest, bored me more often than interested me. Scorsese is an absolute master at world and character building, and the acting is obviously top quality. But he has had better gangster films than this. There was very little tension or anything of real thematic weight in those first two and a half hours. Partly because the main character Frank didn't really seem to absorb or react to anything that he was doing, including the what was supposed to be big betrayal at the end. So the first two and a half hours just felt overlong and didn't do much. I mean unless you are fascinating with mobster deal talk, I can't see how you wouldn't be plain bored for most of this too.

But then the last hour - or maybe it was more half an hour - but the last act was a psychological study of ageing, losing everyone you know, rejection, loneliness, and seeking hope - in his own reserved, uncertain way - in the one institution that is left when everything else is taken away, namely faith. It was quietly gripping and tragic.

So that final act I found absolutely brilliant. A retrospect, even if Frank still didn't let the viewers fully in, that I think would have benefited many of Scorsese's previous gangster flicks too. 

So what then is my verdict? If the final act had been the centerpiece of the film and the first two and a half hours were much shorter flashbacks, it would have been a really great movie. In it's current state, I'd rank it as one of Scorsese's lesser films.",e2149d
f98ikvj,"With a runtime of 150min, a budget of $159mil, Scorsese at the helm, and a cast led by DeNiro. Pesci, and Pacino, this movie was much more lowkey and restrained than I expected.

You knew they were gonna wack Joe Gallo before Frank even laid the guns out on the bed. ""It is what it is"", Russ telling Frank ""Don't call him"", countless lines where the expressions and pauses said more. Real emotion. Scorcese nailed it, DeNiro nailed it, Pacino nailed it, and of course, Pesci absolutely killed it. I do believe there was a lot that could've been left out but overall it was a story about Frank's decisions leading him to a regretful place: all alone with nobody but his own guilt. What ties the movie up the best is how the priest asked him the wrong question at the end. He didn't feel remorse for what he did or what he did to his victim's families, he felt remorse for how it affected him all the way at the end of his life and that's what DeNiro and Scorcese have said about the film from the jump. 

Soundtrack was A1, idk if Scorcese picks it out himself but he always has the best music in his films.

My only serious gripe with this movie was that the ""de-aging"" was ASS. idk how much they spent on it but it was not convincing at all, but I understand how using the same actors could be crucial in a film that relies so heavily on the passage of time to tell the story.",e2149d

Would put Pacino as the stand out, Pesci close second then De Niro third. I’m looking forward to being able to watch it again at home to see how the experience stacks up against a movie theatre.

very early on, after the assassination in the barber shop, DeNiro narrates how Peschi's character was so high in the mob, that he was the guy tapped to put  a lid on a potential war as a result of that killing.

He leans into the car, and the guy inside says, ""just tell him, 'it is what it is.'

Later, when DeNiro is told that this is the phrase he has to say to Hoffa, it's making a clear point that the Teamsters are no longer the 'bank' for the mafia - that the mafia was taking over completely, and there isn't any discussion. It Is What It Is.",e2149d

I think the de aging was needed because of the themes of the film, how it shows these people's lives at different moments may not have been so impactful.

I suspect it was just too many disparate events and characters spread out over so long, but I didn't connect with a lot of it on a deep level.  Also, there's a bunch of scenes from comments here that people clearly thought were really funny but didn't work that way for me (like Pacino apologizing).  Maybe that didn't help.

To be more upbeat, visually stunning, generally great performances, and I thought the last 30-40 minutes were great though, and easily my favorite part of the film.  Was also a real pleasure to see Pesci again, he's great as always.

Oh, and to comment on the de-aging - I noticed it and it did occasionally detract a touch, but didn't ruin anything for me, and I noticed it less and less.  I'm actually kind of glad I didn't see it theatrically now though - I think it would have been more distracting on a huge screen in 2k or 4k, which has been my experience with previous de-aging or all CG characters in live action.",e2149d

Now after it being a day since I’ve watched it, I still feel the same way but I do think there are parts that work really really well, but the movie as a whole is just so drawn out and very different tone wise for the first 2/3 vs the last 1/3. 

My biggest critic is it just feels like Scorsese didn’t do anything new with this movie than what he’s done. Goodfellas is incredible and you get the whole thing with crime doesn’t pay. Wolf of Wall Street is enjoyable but maybe not as much as Goodfellas, but again, you get the too good to be true until it all comes crashing down theme again. With this, you get a more realistic approach but the thing is, the whole loneliness motif seems kind of tacked on in the end.",e2149d

f9d4ysu,It's hilarious how blinded people are by the fan service.

f8xe97s,"My favorite Scorsese mob film and my second favorite film of the decade. It's a wonderful deconstructionist take on crime, death, family, gender, class, capitalism, labor, faith, and what it means to be an American. I was incredibly moved. Pesci's wonderful but it's Pacino that won me over with his Hoffa. 

My favorite thing about this movie was the honesty of the final 30 minutes. Frank clearly never really reckoned with his actions because he never truly felt like he did anything wrong. I can't help but sympathize with it. The Irishman is a constant call to unlearn the cruel ways this world has taught us to treat other people, while sympathizing with those who've been tragically unable to resist the tides of history. 

One of my all-time favorite movies about death. Surprisingly hilarious. Achingly, achingly sad. I'll remember this movie forever. I'm so glad it exists.",e2149d

It seems like this is universally loved and the ending was very emotional for people. Anyone care to share their reasons why?

f9ea8ud,"I felt like the film was Joe Pesci, and I was Peggy. It desperately trying to impress me with a great cast and crew in every scene, and me just staring emotionless for its duration.

Pesci was great. Everything else was very lacklustre. Between De Niro's lousy physical performance (understandable - but should've been considered beforehand); the length of the film, yet still managed to not develop any relationship; and the flat and abrupt resolution at the end, it was really only a fan service film for those crying for the cast to reunite.

The only real points I liked reflecting on was the sequences that Stephen Graham were in. When you're acting alongside Pacino and De Niro, it says a lot when you steal each scene.",e2149d
f8vqyhb,"Saw this in theatres last week, but I needed to rewatch. Man, that ending is just so haunting and tragic, it really shows the cost of leading a life like that. I loved how different the last 30 minutes or so, as well as the sequence that builds up towards Hoffa being killed, were from the rest of the film. It basically stripped away any sense of stylized storytelling and just made it feel grounded and mundane in this way that really showed how unglamorous those moments were. I also got quite emotional at the end, probably because my own grandpa is deteriorating fast and I saw that in how Frank was aging. There was this universal aspect of facing one's own mortality. DeNiro nailed the performance, he was great and such a conflicted character as well.",e2149d

And there were some weird cuts or edits",e2149d
f8wstxj,"Saw it on the big screen yesterday, my initial thoughts are it was good overall but it had a few notable issues for me. 

The story of Sheeran and his involvement with Jimmy Hoffa is interesting, and I thought the way the narrative kept switching time frames was a good idea. Scorsese's directing is as good as ever, less flashy than his previous gangster movies but that fits the tone perfectly. The acting was fantastic. Pesci was the standout for me, an excellent subtle performance especially after so long out the game. Pacino was at his bombastic best and had a ton of great lines. De Niro gives his best performance since Silver Linings Playbook in what is a difficult understated role. Ray Romano and especially Stephen Graham stood out too. Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale and Anna Paquin were solid. Its very funny and witty at times, most notably when Pacino and Graham share the screen, whilst retaining an intensity when needed. The last half hour is an interesting reflection on Scorsese's gangster movies and possibly the genre as a whole, it's a brave against type ending that should be commended.

I do have some big issues. I do think it is too long and doesn't do enough to justify its length. To me there is a brilliant 2h30mins - 2hr50mins film in there, but it needed tighter editing (surprising because Schoonmaker's editing is usually great). Too many scenes go on a touch too long and the same ideas just get repeated over again. I also think too much information was crammed in here. A number of characters appear for a couple of scenes or get the tiniest bit of development then are disposed of (such as Crazy Joe). I'd much rather they spent more time on Sheeran's relationship with his family which could have made the ending even stronger. Then there is the de-aging. Although it is very good for what it is, I was never fully convinced by it. De Niro never looks under 55 even when he's meant to be in his 30's, he moves like a pensioner (very noticeable when he beats up the store owner) and his eyes always look weird thanks to the glossy contacts.

I would like to see it again and let it sink some more and I think the good certainly outweighted the bad. Maybe I was just expecting a little too much or some else (more along the lines of Once Upon a Time in America). It's certainly a positive to see some acting legends of the past together again and it does making for a fitting eulogy to their past work.",e2149d
f8x83a4,"A little confused by Scorsese's use of captions. 


Very minor characters with little to no dialogue are given little epitaphs, while major characters just disappear from the movie with seemingly no mention. The writing is very much on the wall with the final scene, but to have no little blurb about Frank is like getting no closure. Maybe this is his way of eschewing convention with movies like this, it just seems like an odd choice to spend so much time with this person and to have to check the internet afterwards to look up when he died. 


Even these epitaphs are inconsistent, googling some of the names to see the real life counterparts show their year of death being off by more than a few years in at least 1 case (Allen Dorfman for example - film says killed in '79 but in real life it was '83)


No captions establishing locations or time periods, with the exception of one scene where they visit a club in Harlem and it tells us the address for some reason. There were so many scenes where I wanted the year to be established, just to get a grasp on the scope of this story. Obviously, some major historical events are dead giveaways, but for the important events in these characters lives I found it was hard to nail down the timeframes.


I loved the movie, these things just had me scratching my head because Scorsese doesn't seem like the sort of guy to skimp on details.",e2149d

Not a single scene or part dragged or felt pointless. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. Solid 10 out of 10. Pesci, DeNiro, Pacino were all phenomenal. Congrats to netflix. That was worth a monthly subscription fee. Bravo!

On one hand I was completely blown away with Pesci and Pacino's performance.  But it was always opposite of De Niro/Frank and he hardly ever reacted or responded.  The only one who ever really addressed it was Pacino's character twice I think in mentioning how stoic and hard to read Frank is, so maybe that aspect of it alone was what caused it for me.

But until the end when they show Frank in prison and in the retirement home I didn't really buy into Frank as a character and I just saw... De Niro being De Niro.

Overall the whole movie was great, that was just my one gripe.",e2149d

fbpwxcy,"I watched it last night. 7/10

Acting: DeNiro nails it, proves that he's still got it. Besides the scene where he beats the hell out of the grocery store owner I couldn't tell he's 76 years old in real life. Pesci's performance was decent, but no special acting skills involved there, seemed like one of the easiest roles of his life. Pacino's performance didn't get to me, I could sense that he wasn't in the moment as an actor when yelling as Hoffa but maybe it's just me. Not the Pacino of the 90s, that's for sure. 

Story: When I realised that the story is based on real people and real life I got more hooked to the movie. However, if all of those characters and the events were fictional I'd rate the movie much lower. There was a lot of character building (probably based on real events) that I could do without, but probably Scorsese wanted to capture the characters in the most realistic way possible. I loved the ending though, cause it showed the more human side of mobs. 

Length: The length of the movie is not justified and the middle of the movie feels kind of slow and dramatic building up to the final part. On the 2h mark I checked how much is left and thought oh god 1h30' left. 

Visual effects: Didn't distract me that much, especially cause DeNiro doesn't move and walk like an old man at all. I could tell the eyes were lenses or digitally edited, but I was buying into it, it wasn't ridiculous. 

Easter egg (**SPOILER AHEAD** about the movie Heat (1995) too! Read with caution): Correct me if I'm wrong but the only time DeNiro and Pacino acted together was in Heat (1995) where Pacino kills DeNiro, and in this movie this anomaly in the hollywood universe was fixed

Overall: OK movie, way longer than it should be. I believe if it wasn't for Scorsese, DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci and their real life counterparts this movie would go unnoticed. 7/10",e2149d

f8wtpxa,"Hmmmmm. An odd movie for me. 

Maybe it's because I'm a Brit, I might have missed out on the cultural context (Jimmy Hoffa's importance) and thus failed to appreciate certain aspects of the story. I'm guessing it was/is a big story and well known tale in America? 

Anyway, the movie was really lengthy, could have done with cutting half an hour off of it. The de-ageing was fine, didn't even notice it. Wished there was more Keitel scenes, could really have done with him as a Quartet. 

The last 20 minutes were very, very poignant. 

The individual performances? Were absolutely amazing. Pacino was my favourite and those performances (Pesci and De Niro too) were Oscar worthy. 

But the idea that this was Scorsese's finest piece? Uhhhh, what?!? Maybe a different taste I guess but Casino and Goodfellas (9/10s for me) were far better. 

I was leaning to a 7.5/10 but those 20 minutes pumped it up to an 8/10. Wonder if the movie will be better on re-watch and reading the story around the topic.",e2149d

f9hpfji,"Overall, I'm disappointed. I think the story was a bit disjointed and never really felt like it was building up to anything. Then they all get super old and it just kinda... ends. 

The main conflict itself is quite interesting, between Hoffa and the mafia. Outside of a few overacted scenes like the office tantrum, I thought Pacino did a pretty good job. As did Pesci. Now as for Sheeran and Di Niro playing him, that I had issues with. The character felt too passive, just kinda there throughout the movie receiving exposition with the occasional awkward shooting scene (where Di Niro really moved like an old man). He pretty much sucked up to the other characters and never really felt important. Di Niro's performance was weird. I feel like he nailed the end of it, and the phone call to Jo Hoffa, but the rest seemed phoned in. Part of it might be the CGI, but a lot of the time he had this really awkward half smile that was kind of annoying.

fakjaqd,"I liked it but I don’t think it’s on the level of Goodfellas or The Departed. This was definitely made so the core four can get back together one last time.


This had lots of musical montages and lots of narration which felt like an easy route when a lot of Frank’s voiceovers could’ve been delivered through dialogue.


Also something that bothered me, the present-day FBI would’ve 100% visited Peggy to find out why she’s estranged with her father. And they’d 100% share their theories to her about Jimmy’s disappearance hoping it gets her to forgive Frank if he shares what he knows. The FBI would’ve known Frank is getting religious and going to church. He already wants to confess. 


^ What I’m saying is, they’re the best profilers in the world. They’re gonna know where Frank’s weak spots are and use it with surgical precision. Peggy would’ve visited her dad at the FBI’s behest to persuade him into letting the Hoffas know what happened to Jimmy.

It's about no matter what you try to accomplish in life, no matter how great you try to become, none of your accomplishments matter when old age hits and death comes knocking on your door.

That's why Peggy barely had lines, the audience don't get to know her that well because Frank did not get to know her well and the funny thing is, getting to know her was what he really desired the most but was not able to get because of the choices he made, especially his choice to kill Hoffa.

For a supposed 'whole-life' story not a huge amount happens. We don't get to see the ins and outs what it's like to be Frank, all we get is a few hit jobs where he shoots someone and then runs away. The most intense scene comes from none of the main characters or from a main scene, instead it's someone's wife turning a car key which isn't remotely important for the story. There is zero character depth for the women in the story so that Martin can make a single salient point that Frank is a bad father and husband. The gangsters don't feel like gangsters and they don't come across as scary. An exceedingly long film which doesn't really take you on a ride.

When you think back on your past, you don't imagine yourself as exactly the person you were then.  You remember a sort of bland, basic version of the person you are now.  For me personally, I have a hard time picturing exactly what I looked like 10 or 15 years ago. I basically just remember how I look now but with less facial hair (I'm 26).  

Frank is recounting his life, so of course we're not seeing a perfect exact replication of events that happened.  We're seeing snippets and vague memories.  It would only make sense that Frank is remembering a bland, smoothed out version of the man he is now.

The faces looked okay enough, but there were a bunch of scenes where De Niro is supposed to be in his 40s or 50s and he just moves like a much older man. 

It got better as the characters aged in the movie, but I think the movie would have been better served by younger actors who were more of a middle ground between the ages they'd have had to play. I know Scorsese wanted to work with the guys he's made his gangster classics with, but I think that ended up being more for his sake than his audience's sake. He's definitely earned enough good will to do what he wants, and I did still like the movie overall, but like I said I wanted to love it.",e2149d
f8ytx4l,"This movie was a hard watch tbh. I love mob movies and anything Scorcese makes really but this...this was just hard to watch. Deniro and Pacino both look constantly old and tired. Deniro was supposed to be playing a 30 something year old at the start but he looks 60 from start to finish no matter how much CGI they put on his face. His body movement is just off. They cant pull off the same roles as they used to. 

Pesci is the only one with some energy but even he looks old. At times his face looked like one of the CGI warcraft green monsters. It didnt look that good but, hey they tried. Amazing actor as well but hes old, he cant do the same things he used to. No matter how much CGI they put on their face their body movement is that of old men. 

It just doesnt work having these old guys play active mob members. They. look. tired. I couldnt get past that. That fight scene with the grocer was just hard to watch because Deniro is an old man and cant really move like he used to. I do love his movies but you cant expect him to pull off the same roles at 76 years old. 

I liked the story, I liked the acting but it lacked the energy that these men used to have. I gotta give it a no like from me.",e2149d

f8vb4gh,"This is such a dense film. A mixture of Scorsese's panache and personal. It unravels as it goes not revealing the big picture until the last act. So i took all of it in and enjoyed as it progressed but had doubts on whether it's gonna stick it's landing and wham! Scorsese killed it with the landing. The film is surprisingly lighter in tone but it's complemented with a poignant last hour where it reaches to greatness. It's three and half hour run time didn't really bother me but a little bit shorter run time couldn't have hurt.  


Robert De Niro reminded me of his 'Goodfellas' days but his performance in the last act deserve much praise. Al Pacino stole every scene he is in. Joe Pesci surprisingly gave an understated performance. On the flip side, i did thought that this would've been even perfect had it been made when these old timers were young or say some 20 years before. The de-aging is fine on the face but it's clearly evident in the way De Niro moves. It was hard to ignore. That said the last act couldn't have come at a better time when Scorsese is in his twilight stage delving into the inner psyche (also one of the reasons i loved 'Silence'). The first two hours needed the last hour more than it needed them but compliment each other well.

To sum it in one sentence i would The Irishman is the climax to all the gangster films Scorsese made.",e2149d

There are a number of technical things detracting from the story, from the CGI injected reality to some strange dialog to awkward blocking of the actors that reveal just how old they really are (DeNiro tough guy scene, beating up the store clerk was almost too awkward to watch) and other issues but there is a good story being told here and I guess that's what's most important.

f98b88s,"As a huge Scorsese fan I hate saying this but this movie was a bit of a disappointment for me. So without further ado.

**Pros:**

Pacino and Pesci were just stellar in this. Pacino as Hoffa just stole every scene and Pesci in the back half of the movie is the mobster I loved from Casino and Goodfellas.

Cinematography is always top notch

**Cons:**

Deaging looked terrible to me. First 30 minutes it looked like Pesci and De Niro were 3 feet tall and most of the the time De Niro looked like a video game character. His eyes looked so weird and it was distracting overall.

45 minutes could have easily been taken off this movies, stuff like the fish in the car was not needed at all and just general rambling that added nothing.

I didn't feel anything at all for Frank's daughters leaving him. I felt like it wasn't built up very well. Too much focus was taken away from them where I just did not care about Peggy. There's zero character depth to her. She just blankly stares at Frank. There's a lot of supporting characters that lacked depth actually. 

Pacing was off as well.The nonlinear storyline made it difficult to figure out where in the timeline I was and the dogshit cgi made it difficult as well.. Compare this to Tarantino who pulls it off well.

Overall: This movie was an average 7/10 with two great performances but lacking in pacing and storyline to put it over the top.",e2149d
f99i2rf,"I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person who wasn't the biggest fan of this film. Some of the performances were great and the last bit was very well done but the film as a whole was just a mess. 

Overlong with too many characters and plots thrown in only to make sure it was all accurate.  The whole Crazy Joe plot  comes out of nowhere half way through and is barely referenced again. The characters outside of the main three or four were very flat and lacking in development. We barely see any elaboration on the relationship between Frank and his family, with only emotionless stares between Frank and his daughter and basically nothing between Frank and his wife. Most scenes went by very fast with no room to breathe or build up atmosphere. 

The movie could have been seriously improved by just reducing the amount of time and characters that were covered. A narrow focus on Frank and the other 2 or 3 major characters in the lead up to Hoffa's assassination with the scenes of Frank in the nursing home and occasional flashbacks to earlier years would have been ideal.",e2149d

This movie was fantastic. Extremely well paced character progression. Key scenes were not rushed. Dialogue stayed true to every key actor's personality. The theme was masterfully played out. Amazing performances across the board. It's a modern day Godfather, albeit definitely not as good.

I dunno, I just didn't feel a center. I of course loved all the old guys getting together and found the CGI faces to be amazing.",e2149d
feh7i8s,"Tried watching this last night, I got to where he meets Hoffa and just wasn't into it at all, I couldn't get past the cgi. At no point does DeNiro feel like a real person which made it very hard to care about the plot.

Maybe it was having my introduction to the film being people making fun of the beating up the grocer scene, but once you see one thing wrong with the way ""young"" DeNiro (who looks fifty) acts or moves, you start noticing it in every scene.

The directing, editing, everything just reminded of some of the great gangster films like The Godfather, like Goodfellas. Films I just thought couldn't be touched in today's day and age, but here I am eating my words, and I couldn't be any happier. 

If you showed this film to me and asked me when I was made, I would have said 30 years ago atleast. 

Everything just came together so brilliantly that just thinking about it puts a smile to my face. 

I'm so thankful that this film even got made. Loved every moment. I got used to the de aging surprisingly quickly, and I wouldn't cut this film, I feel like every scene added something to the film. But then again, I enjoy slow paced films like Blade Runner.",e2149d

The Sheeran character was so toned down. He just looked dumb and stuttering,  not the dumb but dangerous looking grumpy guy i imagined him to be. 

They cut off that first wife like she was an extra. Didn't  like that,...just like that she's gone?

I wished that killing hoffa scene took place  at night, but how the depressing afternoon time was chosen was so much better. I also wished there was a scene of them putting him in the car trunk. And would've  been so awesome if hoffa saw it coming. But just like that he's gone.",e2149d

Obviously this movie is trying to tell a different kind of story, but it's one I felt was a little too drawn out, given the run time.

Acting? Great.
Directing? Great.


All that being said, As I’m watching the movie around 1.5 hours in I can’t help but think, “wow, this movie is really not good.” I can’t figure it out. Something is wrong with the movie. What did Goodfellas do that this movie didn’t do with virtually the same story and cast? What is missing?

The movie has Scorsese directing with Pacino, DeNiro, and Pesci as leads. Naturally it’s going to be praised before people even hit “play”. So, reviews don’t really matter to me. I think the way characters were handled in this movie was a problem. It reminds me of the movie “Black Mass” with Depp. That movie had a similar problem. Great directing, great acting, great atmosphere, but for some reason that was a forgettable gangster movie.

When you go back and watch Goodfellas, or even the Departed, all of the characters have unique introductions with backstory. This movie feels like it’s throwing characters at you left and right with no real introduction, but it’s being masked by “omg that’s *famous actor X*” tropes.

I’m happy other people are enjoying it, but I have to honestly say this is one of Scorsese’s worst movies.",e2149d

f8v77ix,"Ok, I really enjoyed it, I need to give it another watch though (My parents decided to call me part way through to talk about Christmas plans >< haha, kinda ruined the flow a little). 

But one thing that stood out was, in the scene where Frank and Russ are having breakfast and talking about him going to Detroit,  I swear De Niro kept looking at the camera like he's trying to communicate his turmoil directly with the audience with his eyes. Like, it might have just been Frank unable to look Russ in the face, but it's just... so often actors are told don't look in the lens, so when it happens, it's disconcerting and kinda weird.

f8wx0en,"EDIT: /u/Jason4hees was kind enough to correct me on this. While Marylin Monroe did have a dual relationship with Sam Giancomo and JFK, she was not shared by him and  Bobby Kennedy. There was an entirely different mistress that they shared named Judith Exner. This story is like giant onion with an infinite number of layers. Thanks for the correction and clarification, /u/Jason4hees! To answer my own question, it's omitted because that would be something for a Sam Giancomo movie, not this one.

Odd choice that they would completely brush away the Marylin Monroe connection to this story.

In the 1st act, they refer to the fact (via Peschi voiceover) that one of the crime bosses (Sam Giancomo) and Bobby Kennedy had the same girlfriend at the same time.

Many have come forward to name that girlfriend as Marylin Monroe, and suggest that she was either a pawn for one side to get dirt on the other, or was working both sides against the middle - and that her overdose was an accident during an attempt by one of the sides to extract information out of her while having her heavily sedated.

However, certain scenes should have been rewritten with this in mind. There is no reason they could not have used a double and filmed it from behind him more to obscure his face, yes the audience would perhaps realize it but, it's a far better alternative to what was included.

That being said, this film is by far his most revealing. A film centered around the end. The whole film is building towards Frank's end and him looking back at his life with regret and shame. Realizing his mistakes and looking for atonement/redemption before he passes on. Scorcese said in an interview leading up to the release that the themes of the end held true to him throughout filming. 

Al Pacino was fantastic. Joe Pesci was very good, as well as Deniro.  Pacino to me stole the show imo. He was charismatic and honestly hilarious. All the performances I felt were good. 

The de-aging was a bit distracting but i was able to look past it because of the cinematography and the camera work. The scene where Frank meets ""Big Ears"" and looks at the Cubans loading the guns onto trucks being a prime example. 

Overall, I would give it a 8.3 out of 10. Long and could have done without an explanation on every detail of The Teamsters operation and those who died later on, but still an incredible achievement. The last 45 minutes and the buildup towards Hoffa's murder were unbelievable.",e2149d

I felt nothing for The Irishman. It was mostly an incredibly dull three and a half hours, I came very close to shutting it off when I was about two hours in.

The de-aging is a mixed bag, there are points it looks great but others where it can completely take you out of the moment. Some middle scenes with De Niro and Pacino looked damn near perfect. Like most people have pointed out though, it's hard to mask that these guys all move and carry themselves like senior citizens and talk like they're old men for the entire lives. Also De Niro looked like an old dog with milky cataract eyes. It doesn't help too that the worst and most glaring de-aging occurs in the beginning portions of the film, so it's fighting an uphill battle for your immersion very early on. Overall, I'd say the artists did a great job, an incredibly commendable job, but knowing how much work was done in almost every shot I couldn't help but subconsciously assess every image. 

This also brings me to another issue I had with the movie, I felt it lacked spontaneity. Because of the nature of how the key cast needed to be filmed for the sake of the artists in charge of de-aging their faces, many of the shots feel rigid and locked off and like it lacks the real charm and life that Scorsese has injected into all of his films. 

I enjoyed Pacino as Hoffa most, I'd say. Pesci is so reserved that his performance hardly resonated with me, I can understand the praise he's getting, but the role just didn't grab me. The scenes I tended to enjoy the most involved the actors who played the age they looked like. The epilogue to the movie was done really well with the aging De Niro but it didn't really resonate very strongly with me because the previous three hours also didn't.

Really disappointing. Really dull.",e2149d

f951qp7,"What an absolutely marvelous time. My friend who saw an advanced screening basically begged me to watch it in theatres and I am glad I did. An epic tale of loyalty and betrayal driven by 3 masterful performances. The sequences were so well shot and abrupt with its bloodshed. Even the more minor performances like Cannavale, Keitel and Graham were great. The de-aging never bothered me save for the shopkeeper scene and I thought it was really well edited considering it was 210 munites but never felt exhausting or drawn out. It felt long sure, but never slow or boring. To think in the past 20 years, Scorsese's worst film has been Shutter Island which was still good shows why I can't see anyone else hold the crown.",e2149d
f8ytfdo,"If I were to compare Scorsese movies to Thanksgiving dinners, here's how I would explain this movie.

Casino is the most perfect, Thanksgiving dinner. All of the food is flawlessly prepared, the family is well behaved and my football team won. 

The Irishman is the same food from the Casino dinner, but served with someone's hands into a messy pile on my plate. It all tastes good, but the presentation is a mess. But, its Thanksgiving so you really don't care much. My team lost by a field goal, after an epic back and forth struggle, and two of my aunts got into a small screaming match in the driveway while smoking cigarettes. 

I am going to make several comparisons to Goodfellas and Casino, for one specific reason - this is a Scorsese gangster film. He has set the ultimate prescient for American crime movies and if you're going to shell out $140mil, you better get something that is on par with the previous two.

Pros

* Pesci carries the entire movie on his back. He delivers a Oscar-worthy performance. I can't believe he is still this good, after being out of the game for so long. 

* Emotional tone is spot-on. Scorsese makes you laugh and cry at all the right moments. 

* The deaging tech is sick. While you can kind of see an old man's movements in the younger versions of Di Nero and Pesci, I thought the effects were flawless. 

Cons

* Scorsese has lost his fastball, period. I think Netflix gave him enough rope to hang himself for this movie. The pacing is a disaster with the nonlinear story line. Tarantino can do it, Scorsese cannot. I don't know why he chose to do this in what is almost certainly his last gangster film. I would have been fine with a linear story line. It was also difficult to keep up with which daughter was which.

* Editing. This movie could easily lose 30 - 45 min and be a lot tighter. Rambling dialog which has no relevance to the story (the fish exchange/who's sitting where in the car/the fuckup son in the jewelry store) could have been cut and tightened up the pacing.

* The score is nothing compared to Goodfellas or Casino. 

* Forgettable supporting characters. At least give me one or two Jimmy Two Times or little old woman (RIP Catherine Scorsese) telling her son to stop cursing, something. There is none of that here. These sorts of characters give so much life to the world and without them the world narrowed to just the main three characters. 

* Who was Di Nero talking to in the beginning when he's sitting in the wheelchair? Scorsese breaks the 4th wall a few times, but doesn't stick with it. Either do it and be consistent, or don't.

* No Scorsese killing montage at the end. This was just my expectation that wasn't met, but with all the asides about how and when different people went - I hoped we'd get a quick run through of all those guys meeting their end. Nope.",e2149d
f9xyzfe,"I just spent the better part of a day slogging through this 3 1/2 hour self indulgent piece of mediocrity. Why is everyone spewing praise on this?? I’m a big fan of Scorsese but this is no Goodfellas. Not even close. And De Niro with those disturbing blue contacts... no. 
De Niro, Peschi, Pachino and Kietel are one dimensional actors. They are very good playing those type of intense gangster-like characters for sure. But they are so played out. This felt like Scorsese’s ‘let’s get the band back together’ pet project that Netflix was hoping would get them in the conversation for an Oscar. This movie was JUST OK. Hope I don’t get whacked for this opinion.",e2149d
f9qcqk8,"This movie was honestly so weird. I think it's absurd that Scorsese uses shitty CGI to make DeNiro look young, and kind of took me out of the whole thing. I think a lot of people may miss that this film is about the struggle between young and old, as well as good and evil. Scorsese probably realized that it may be the last time he works with DeNiro, Pacino, and Pesci on the same film, so it's kind of an homage to those powerhouses of the genre and this is almost like their last ride. That's another reason the film is so damn long, I really think he wanted to sell the fact that this story is an ENTIRE life. Not just the good ol' days where all the mobsters are killing, getting killed, and making that sweet sweet money, instead we see these guys go to jail, to age, to die. I liked the angle of this movie, and think it was genuinely a good enough script to warrant a Scorsese mob movie, but I just think certain parts of the execution were flawed.",e2149d
f95epgj,The movie is decent at best.  For it's enormous 3 hour 3 min run time the character connections fell flat.  The movie reviews are hype because it's Scorsese.  I'm a huge fan of his but I have to be honest this wasn't it.,e2149d

fa2sq69,"Very self-indulgent. It's a pity that Scorsese refused use fresh younger actors to play younger versions of the main characters when you consider De Niro shot to fame playing the young Vito Corleone in The Godfather II. 

No amount of CGI was going to mask the ages and liver spots of these old men playing much younger, violent men. There was a palpable lack of energy throughout the movie. Contrast the weak, phony way DeNiro beat up the grocery store owner with how Tony Pro exploded in anger and beat up Hoffa or how Hoffa's son kicked the crap out of the dude who tried to shoot his father in court. You felt the strength and rage of these younger men in these scenes whereas with DeNiro I felt confused, thinking that he was deliberately play acting beating up the grocery man. 

 I couldn't suspend my disbelief that DeNiro was the ""young buck"" that Pesci took under his wing. I just kept being taken out of the movie, especially since I went on a Youtube binge of the best of DeNiro and Pesci scenes from ""Casino"" and 'Goodfellas"". God, what a difference! 

The thing is that we have all seen how younger Pesci, Pacino and DeNiro look and move so trying to cover up their aging faces with CGI just wasn't effective. Their body movements was that of old men, their wives (or the actresses themselves) were much younger...it just wasn't working for me. 

It's typical Boomer inability to move aside to make room for younger folks.",e2149d

f94yd40,"Hate to say it, but DeNiro kind of bungled this one. 

Obviously the physical acting was bad, so much old man energy. When he was beating the shit out of the guy I was laughing my ass off, it looked so fake. 

Also, I don't know how much of this was due to the CGI, but his face seemed really stiff and expressionless. Plus he never looked younger than late 50s. He certainly had his moments, but overall his performance was not great.

Al Pacino saved the movie. His performance was amazing, and extremely entertaining.",e2149d
f9hj9d8,"Story felt long, also seems less believable than even Henry Hill's account in Goodfellas. It seemed like this Frank guy was Forrest Gump the main cog in the middle of all the crazy stuff that was happening during the 60's / 70's. The idea he was that close to both the crime bosses and to Jimmy Hoffa seemed so far fetched and beyond believable. 

The CGI for me was not good as well, it did not look realistic at all. The way DeNiro was walking around and his manners and body movement, he looked like an old man. I think if everyone involved was able to do this film about 15 years ago, it probably would've been better. That first scene between DeNiro and Pepsci really felt out of place, ""hey kid need some help"" I was like kid? kid, you both look like you're 50 years old, acted and sounded like old men.  

People praise the acting, but to me it looked like nobody was actually into it, except Pacino, he was manic as Jimmy so I guess that counts as not phoning it in, but everyone seemed like they were reading from a script with no effort, especially Pepsci. I know he didn't want another comparison to his previous gangster films with Martin but this was flat and quiet to a point he might as well have been played by someone else. 

I felt the strongest acting came from all the supporting cast, they all looked and acted authentic and real. From Ray Ramano to the actor who played Tony Pro to the wives and bit players, like Joey Gallo and Crazy Joe. They were all very good. 

From a technical standpoint the film is beautiful, the scenes looked authentic and  the way it's shot was very tight and the framing was very good to outstanding.

Overall not as good or as entertaining as Good Fellas and Casino, it's not a bad film, I'm glad I saw it, but it did feel long and yes a little boring.",e2149d
f9xredy,"Big miss for me. Maybe Scorsese's weakest movie. It doesn't justify the runtime and De Niro just doesn't bring the energy he needs to a frankly (no pun intended) boringly written character.  
  
Shoutout to Al Pacino who brought a lot of energy and stubborn charisma to Jimmy Hoffa but in a way he almost seemed cartoonish because he was the *only* one who actually brought any. Add in the sometimes distracting CGI masks and I felt like I was watching *Dick Tracy* at parts.   
  
Many characters come in and out, there are a lot of great character actors in this and they don't get much time because they are spread too thinly.    
  
The family drama feels like largely an afterthought marginally addressed at the end of the movie.
  
Nothing offensively bad about the movie, but it was just another boring Netflix dud. And I say that as someone who enjoys Scorsese movies and is familiar with the historical context behind the movie. When you consider the cost behind this and the runtime though? I've seen him do much better with much less.",e2149d

The same long, tracking (might be called something else) shots that were cool in Goodfellows but just so done to death now. And for no reason!!! I remember seeing Casino and thinking that it was just Goodfellows in Vegas but at least that was different and well done and the plot zipped along.

DeNiro's Frank is almost as bad - a callous man who committed multiple war crimes, has no value for human life, no love for his children, and justifies his actions to himself which is a clear sign of a sociopath.

Pacino's Hoffa is shown to the most principled and nuanced character who actually built something that helped people (even though he was also a criminal), was hugely popular for good reason, had morals and actually loved people in his life.

Frank and Russel were scum - I felt zero sympathy or anything other than scorn for them.",e2149d
f8xt78q,"the first hour felt a little slow, but overall the 3.5 hours flew by. it was not as great a film as Godfather, but I'd say its pretty damn close. what stood out was the acting. Pesci was truly great in a kind of role I don't think I'd ever seen him in before, De Niro was great too, as always, especially in the last hour of the film. even though the scene where he was beating up the grocery store owner for shoving his daughter was embarrassing to watch (why no stunt double?¿). but the one who stole the show for me was Al Pacino. he was charismatic when he needed to be, menacing when he needed to be, a loving friend when he needed to be, and a crazy hothead when he needed to be. his scenes were definitely my favourite scenes in the movie (especially that meeting with Tony Pro). I truly believe he should win the Oscar for best supporting actor.",e2149d

f92a3o2,"I feel bad for anyone who had to sit through all three and a half hours of this film without a break.  While it's a great film, I had to take a break and come back the next day partway through.  

Anyway, Scorsese's camera work was top notch as usual, I'm glad to see De Niro in another serious role again for once and Pacino was absolutely mesmerizing as Hoffa.  The final half hour or so was particularly poignant, with De Niro going from the dangerous, always-in-control hitman to the sad geriatric we're all fated to become eventually.

f940a0g,"The last 30-40 minutes were probably the best of the film.

My biggest gripe besides not knowing who Frank is talking to throughout the film is that we didn’t get enough scenes showing Frank interacting with his family.

We saw their distance and fear through Peggy which was good but i wanted at least a scene with the other sisters and wife before his desolation. Him finally talking to one of his daughters was such a tease. For a movie that’s a lot about “show don’t tell” it didn’t show the family issues enough and instead did it through exposition.

f8x86fb,"I thought everyone except for Deniro was great in this film. He played himself..which is a 70+ year old man..his “beat down” of the store owner was comical at best with his near paralyzed right arm and weak tippy taps on his foot.
      Someone else should have been cast entirely for his role it would have made the film concretely better. They should have used a stunt actor at bare minimum for that scene. Throughout the film he showed no gravitas or charisma and was wooden..he brought the film down. He did a great job with the Jo Hoffa phone call. Joe Pesci was amazing..Pacino showed once again why he is light years above Deniro as they both age. Nicholson was a better Hoffa.. Also..fun fact..Sheehan had nothing to do with Joe Gallos murder..he was killed by 3 short dark haired Italians with numerous witnesses.. This film could have lost 15 minutes also to achieve the same or better result. 
     Bottom line: This film comes off as mostly fantasy however I do believe Hoffa was in a car lured by O’Brien out of trust and shot and cremated..it makes sense and forensic found his blood type in his car. Sheeran I don’t believe was there but later inserted himself when everyone was gone into the story and most of not all were dead..he hijacked the truth to give himself false glory.

I don't know, I'm glad they made it but I'm so distracted by the fact these guys aren't supposed to be in their 70s.  I've also read a very similar story by James Elroy.  Not really that relevant but its kind of taking the fizz from this a bit.

I'm happy for all these guys to get a swan song, so I guess that's worth it.  But I have this nagging feeling it should be with younger actors.  Even actors in their 50s wouldnt be as distracting.

Way too many crimes are shown and most of the emotions are removed from the movie just to give space to the (I guess plausible) historic explanation of Hoffa's death. The bond between Frank and his daughter doesn't feel like something the spectator can really feel for. The CGI is amazing, but seeing De Niro kicking the shop owner for Peggy was going to make me fall from the chair in laughter... Yeah you can deage him but he'll still move like he's an old person because that's what he is. They should have probably just not shown that or left them both fight in the shop. Overall I felt bored for most of the movie and I don't think the runtime was the problem, because I've seen even longer stuff... It was just not interesting to me...

DeNiro and Pesci are great in this movie past the first hour and a half. There is absolutely no reason they needed to be in the first third of the movie. DeNiro moves like an old man (which I was surprised, since he actually appears older in this than he does in Joker, despite this being filmed before). The scene outside the grocer is so incredibly far fetched, I dont understand how it was put past editing. Scorsese knows what hes doing with the camera, how did he just..let..that go? At no point do they ever look younger. Their faces...sure, I suppose, but the way they move is OLD.

His daughter...ooof. I understand what Scorsese is going for, but goddamn, they couldnt find a more fluid actress? She straight up seems like a robot at times.

Good to see all these legends together, Im glad the movie came together in the end, but strangely enough I wish Scorsese had made this immediately following the Departed, when I felt like he was immediately at the top of his game. Refined, but still brass.

Anyways, its very bleak and does not have the same ""spark"" the Departed or Goodfellas has. Silence is one of my favorite movies, but I dont think that feel works with this movie.

f94ptn6,"I was so disappointed with this film. I've been waiting to see it for three years, and I came away actually being angry at Scorsese for his direction. I remember watching Man of Steel and not thinking it was a ""great"" film. Now, I didn't think it was a HORRIBLE film, but I came away thinking, ""Eh, Man of Steel was okay.""

&#x200B;

I did not feel this way at all about The Irishman. My feelings were not, ""This was okay,"" even though I don't think it's a terrible film, I feel bad that I can't honestly say it was a GREAT film. I LOVE Scorsese's films, and not just the old classics like Casino and GoodFellas, I like more recent Scorsese films like Wolf of Wall Street. I was hoping this would be another classic I would want to watch over and over. Honestly, I'm considering a rewatch to try and give it another chance, but I'm DEBATING that.

&#x200B;

Frank evolves from hijacking loads to collecting debts to doing hits. He soon meets Jimmy Hoffa and becomes his bodyguard, while continuing to do jobs for Bufalino on the side. Sheeran delivers a truckload of weapons to Florida for the CIA, who are working with the mafia. Hoffa goes to jail. Hoffa gets out of jail. Hoffa has endless meetings with people he doesn't want to meet with. Hoffa shoots his mouth off. Hoffa basically gives them no choice but to kill him. Frank is pushed into a corner by Bufalino and forced to kill Hoffa himself. Frank is uneasy about killing Hoffa and it haunts him.

&#x200B;

This is where the film should have ended, but it didn't. It droned on and on and on about nothing. Sheeran's daughter doesn't want to talk to him? It's VERY LIGHTLY implied that she knows he killed Hoffa, but it is never directly stated, and that pissed me off. The only scene we have to go on of her EVEN SUSPECTING him of murdering people is when she sees him with a gun a few years earlier. She doesn't even say, ""Why do you have a gun?""; she says, ""Where are you going?"" and he doesn't tell her anything except, ""I'm going to work."" Was I supposed to feel bad that she didn't talk to him anymore? He said she was shy anyway, and we haven't seen them talking ANYWAY, so it's not like it was a great loss. We do have some implications of her being in DEEP admiration of Hoffa, but I just feel that this angle was not expanded on enough as far as actual dialogue was concerned.

&#x200B;

This happens a lot in this movie. Things are just shown without being explicitly stated. If this were my only gripe with Scorsese's direction, I wouldn't bother even writing this down. The far greater sin is this movie's pacing. The pacing is horrible, absolutely horrible. For NO REASON, it will cut to a shot of something that has NOTHING to do with what is currently happening onscreen, and the shot will just LINGER, for NO REASON. Example: After Frank kills Sal, they have a shot of a guy smoking a cigarette in front of a building, and the shot lingers, several angles on the guy. This guy has nothing to do with the plot, is not a major or even a minor character, he's just a random civilian. WHY INCLUDE SHOTS LIKE THIS? It makes the film look tacky. It also doesn't make sense when they suddenly cut to slow motion and close ups during some of the shots of extras. It feels like I'm watching a loading screen waiting for the film to resume.",e2149d
f9nsv37,"There's virtually not a gangster movie, show or documentary i havent watched and enjoyed on some level. This one is the pits. Deniro just aint as good an actor as he thinks he is. Just looking around with your frankenstein muppet look dont equate to good acting. ""It's what it is."". Wow. Remember ""This is this""? -Deerhunter -was cool then like 50 years ago. He looks too tired to even turn profile sideways for signature ""You talking to me?"" or to insinuate murder (Morty - Goodfellas). The rest of the performances were decent and i didnt mind the slow pacing but Deniro is just so played out at this point its not even worth the mockery - it'll only make you tired like Bob.

Having 75-80 year old actors playing someone that age and de-aging them with cgi is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard of. Not only do they have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do it, the actors in the whole movie look like they're either wax sculptures, or characters in a playstation cutscene, and it's just creepy and bizarre looking. 

I know people love this movie and that's cool, I just can't get over the de-aging nonsense. I just can't get out it out my mind when I'm watching the movie and I would have prefered if they just casted actors of the right age.

f8xtnhn,"After digesting it a little more, some final thoughts. 

 After a decade being stranded in development hell, with a massive budget  that could finally relieve me of my long overdue college debt and make  my car brand new, The Irishman has finally arrived and not only lives up  to the hype, but at times surpassing it. Unlike similar great directors  who emerged in the 70s, like Coppola, DePalma, Lucas, sometimes  Spielberg, Scorsese has never lost grip on his master craftsmanship and  near-flawless storytelling. The Irishman is no exception, and even ranks  near the top alongside his greatest films. It's on the same caliber as  Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull, and The King of Comedy. It might just  be the richest of them all and the heaviest thematically. It's nearly  three and half hours long, and there's not a moment that seems  unnecessary or uninteresting. It's so absorbing that the length is  hardly even felt. The real mvp is Scorcese's go to editor Thelma  Schoonmaker, who practically demands every award she can possibly  receive. This must have been a daunting project to take on, but the  resaults are extraordinary. Steve Zaillain's screenplay is note-perfect  as well, with some brilliant dialogue, and characters that are  uncommonly fleshed out. And finally, the performances. Seeing DeNiro,  Pacino, and especially Pesci on screen together is electrifying. DeNiro  is beautifully nuanced and back in top form, the best he has been in a  very long time. Al Pacino is a force of nature, he has the flashiest  role but he doesn't devour the scenery, he's in full control, while  being somehow heartbreaking in the second half. Then there is Joe Pesci,  unlike his performances in Casino and Goodfellas, he is effectively  reserved but deeply chilling and sinister in a way we haven't seen from  him before. Rarely would I label a film as an ""instant classic"", but The  Irishman is pretty much exactly that.",e2149d

I’m watching it and mildly entertained but every time I see those shoulders in pain, hips in pain etc I’m left thinking “why the fuck are we doing this”. Can we as a society let go?  I know Boomers can’t, but this felt so often a movie for people who just can’t realize it’s over.

The second time was when Pachino was calling everyone motherfuckers and DeNiro walked out of the room super offended...what the hell was up with that? He was like a hurt middle-schooler.

The final 30-40 minutes were haunting. Some of De Niro’s best work ever, especially that phone call. Pesci was also incredible; glad he came out of retirement for this. Pacino stole nearly every scene he was in, and it was great to see him and De Niro together again.

I’ve read the book, which felt equally overlong (with even more outlandish claims that I’m glad Scorsese didn’t include).

The bigger issue for me was everything was so low energy. DeNiro and Pesci could only deliver lines in a way that there was never any weight behind what was being said.

The power dynamics wasn't fleshed out very well either.  I didn't know who was working for who.  I couldn't tell who had what power over who.  Was Frank ever a boss?  Did he ever have any power except for the pistol?  if so what was the significance of the ring?  Who was on the top of the chain?  Were there people above Russ?  Fat tony?

None of the characters were actually menacing because they actually LOOK decrepit, except some Joe Pecsi bone chilling stares.

That scene where he beats the shopkeeper was pretty cringe too. His age really showed in that scene. No amount of editing will have me believe this guy was a tough, vibrant mobster.

Pesci was amazing though. Normally, we see him as lunatic foot soldier for the mob but in this movie, he's grown into a calm, collected boss. It's amazing.

Tv shows lately are embaracing longer, movie like pacing, shirking episodic stories for longer season long stories.

This felt like a movie doing the opposite. It felt like it had almost a television (season) pacing, allowing time for different scenes and specifics that weren't necessary a progression of the plot but just able to let scenes breathe and spend time in places before moving on.

I hope more longer movies with this sort of pacing become standard, most movies lose a bit of their immersion because the format (1.5-2.5 hours) necessitates short hand which you can see and it takes you out.

You tend to get antsy past 2.5 hours, but because it's Netflix and I was able to pause it (twice) the length didn't wear on me and it made it much more immersive and real.

To me, the computer-de-aging seemed to get better as the movie went along. At first, though, it feels abrupt. Maybe it's how the heads don't track perfectly along with the bodies, or something I can't describe. CGI shadows under the chins. Scaling. It could also be, that we've seen these actors when they were young, and we're expecting to see actual magic. Benjamin Button seems to be the best effort I've seen so far. Another nit-pick right away was the damage to the delivery truck when the characters meet. I believe the scene takes place in the late '50's. The truck should be relatively brand new, but the truck is rusty and the details under the hood are clearly decades old. There's faded paint, rust, dents.

But definitely better than say.... Gangs of NY.

I was a bit annoyed with the CGI, and I couldn't help but feel the actors carry themselves as as old as they actually are now.

Some scenes should have been cut to tighten things up.

I love Scorsese but I wouldn't put this in his top tier. They should have made this movie 10-15 years ago, and I think it would have been a bit more believable.

I also think they should have kept the original title...which was somehow also used?

Some good scenes, and it was good seeing Pesci again, especially in such a reserved performance.

* They really needed to take the CG a lot further. It had so much potential:
   * They never should have tried changing eye color. Never. That was a distraction.
   * They should have played with body mass and weight a lot more. You had 30 year old faces with 80 year old bodies.

f9w58yq,"Decent movie, but hardly worth all the praise it's been lavished with. A lot of dialogue was repetetive and didn't add a lot to the the movie, but helped push it to however long it finally was. The staging seemed super movie-ish, and kind of awkward in a lot of scenes, to the point where I actively thought ""oh, that looks like a movie set for gangster film"" - this happens sometimes in a good way, when you are totally involved in the movie, but this was the bad way where it just takes you out of it. 

The characters were interesting, although I never felt emotionally invested in them or the stakes or the power plays. And while I think it was interesting to show them ageing, I thought the film had almost nothing compelling to say or show about it, except look they are old and many died in that business. Ok, there was some aloness as well, but this guy was never close with his family and the whole daughter side story was a mess.

The whole thing just flies by, and it's staggering how she and Marty keep track of not just characters, but timelines and the multiple tangents the film takes.

f9mtbdj,"This movie made me feel dumb. I understood the beginning and the end, but really couldn't follow the plot at points in the middle with all the gangster/union politics. Why did Hoffa hate Kennedy and back Nixon? What fraud did Hoffa go to prison for? Did any of the Tony Pro stuff even matter at the end? 

I almost shut it off halfway because my gf fell asleep and I was so lost, but the great performances kept me going. The deaging was weird but I got over it. My criticisms would be that it definitely could've been at least a half hour shorter. It couldve used a few more comedic moments - there's no real standout memorable scenes. The tone is kind of one note throughout. Anna Paquin was an odd choice to play a girl in her late teens/early 20s. 

I dunno. It was alright. I don't think it's worth the three and a half hour investment. Did make me a lot more curious about Jimmy Hoffa though.",e2149d
fa3o40i,"I really enjoyed this one but the first 2 hours were so slow!

I see an old crook who  who had outlived most of his friends and associates, who’s family had all but abandoned him. I see a man who wanted to elevate himself into being a more important person than he was. He probably did kill some people but I think there is plenty of doubt to suggest he did not kill either Gallo or Hoffa. And to be honest I thought the portal of Hoffa was a little bit cartoonish. I think there was a hell of a lot more to Hoffa than a guy who continually shouted and lost his cool. I honestly think Jack Nicholson did a better job.",e2149d

Some good performances, though I don't think they're deserving of the fawning people are doing. 

The story meanders and feels unfocused. Most of all I just kept wanting to feel something. Anything. And by the time I did I was jaded from the incredibly long run time. 

Great work from Martin, a well crafted movie on the whole. But I doubt I'll ever watch it again. It simply wasn't all that entertaining. 

A good, not great movie. To be honest it was just not memorable in any meaningful way. I think people gushing and calling it a masterpiece in this thread are going to look really silly in hindsight.",e2149d
f932tma,"CGI looks so strange. Like cinematic game trailer starring De Niro. Especially, his eyes",e2149d
f8wx1b3,"Just a few more observations but these are negative. 

As mentioned in here, De Niro's eyes were off. Like a deep blue colour which was off-putting. 

There were so many names. Mamma mia! So many names that I was losing track.

De Niro's movements in some of the scenes were bad. When he was kicking the shopkeeper in and throwing away his guns at the beach/shore, it was bad. His age really showed when it wasn't suppose to.

Peggy's acting (as a kid and grown-up) was odd. Very robotic. I know it was meant to be that way but I just didn't get it, she was very robotic and, IMO, was a poor acting choice. The relationship between Frank and Peggy had immense emotive impact potential but in the end...it lacked substance, and it was on Peggy's acting behalf than De Niro's. His scene in the bank was fantastic.

One other observation of the last 20 minutes...I felt it was some sort of a goodbye by Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese in some way, they were getting old and saying their goodbyes and presenting the fragility of life. At least, it felt personal to me.",e2149d

f8v3ltj,"I saw it last Saturday. I’ve waited close to a decade for this movie. It was as good as I had hoped for. 

This is an absolute masterpiece, with everyone working at the peak of their powers. After a couple decades of mailing it in, Al and Bobby remind us all why they’re arguably the two best actors alive. Al kills it every second he’s onscreen. Pesci is back and hasn’t lost a step. He plays a much different character here; wiser, less hot-headed, more human. De Niro is fantastic here the entire time - his phone call to Hoffa’s wife near the end is some of the best acting I’ve seen lately.

And Marty... well what can you say about Marty? The movie has long-takes, sweeps, cut-aways... classic Marty in every sense. But it’s shot in a way that respects the story, it’s not a wild carefree ride like Goodfellas or Wolf. 

This is his third masterpiece this decade. IMO he’s one of the two greatest American directors of all time (Kubrick would be the other one).

The best scenes are anytime the big three are interacting with each other, particularly Al and Bobby together. It’s the first time we’ve ever gotten to see this in a real way (Heat is great but they have only one or two scenes together and Righteous Kill, while fun, is ultimately empty and passionless). 

The last half hour or so is obviously less entertaining but just as important as the rest of the film. It’s the Goodfellas crash but more drawn out, slower, deeper, almost scarier: Pain, old age, regret, loss of family, loss of independence... is De Niro being punished? Does he wish he lived a different life? Are his final years that much worse than most of us will experience? It leaves you with more complex feelings than Goodfellas (which I’m not criticizing in the slightest - it’s my favorite movie). 

The 3.5 hours fly by, there’s not a second where I was bored. How can you be when you’re watching these icons perform their craft in ways that we haven’t seen in decades? When the screenplay is this good, it demands everyone step up and give it there all. And the result is an epic; an odyssey.

10/10. Top 5 of the decade. 100% worth the wait.",e2149d

f9fgone,"The Irishman was good, but self-indulgent. Shoulda had 30-45 minutes trimmed off it.",e2149d
f8xn4ct,"Everyone is bagging on the fight with the grocer and for good reason. I watched it about 10 times, and it looks to me like the entire fight from Deniro's side is CGI with his head imposed on a CGI body. In fact, somewhere in the middle of the multiple stomps on the hand, the body clearly reverses back and rolls forward again repeated the same identical stomp in a loop. To me, it's not so much a problem with an old guy trying to have a fight as a bad mapping of a de-aged head onto a CGI body that is rendered in software instead of mo-capped.

run time: most movies are filmed at an initial cut of 3 hours and are then trimmed back to a run time more appropriate for cinematic release. Lots of people are saying that the benefit of being on a streaming service means you dont have to cut the film. I disagree. This feels like someone said, ""enough. We are out of time and money so it's going live"" and they just skipped any final editing that would have (and should have) happened. There's very little artistic value in taking almost 10 minutes of airtime to establish that Rene smokes a lot. There's very little artistic value in having the oldest daughter blank faced stare at the camera in about 5 different scenes. Two, three at the most is all it needs. ""Hey in case you forgot, here's an 11th shot of her glaring at the big mean men from the corner of her eye to remind you that she has daddy issues.' Specifics? okay - the bowling scene doesn't need the creepy 'so.. is he a pedo now I guess?' exchange. Cut from Sheeran bowling right to Peschi talking about a friend at the top needing help. There, saved you 8 minutes of dead airtime.

What did they do with DeNiro's torso in half this movie? He doesn't move his neck (in some cases, it's like he doesn't even have one) and his chest looks like he's wearing a body cast under his shirt. I know Sheeran was a really tall guy, but were they trying to mimic something here, or is this just an artistic choice to make him seem like a big thuggish guy?

oh and just a random observation for those who are still reading (hey thanks!): a lot of the sub-titles about when people were killed are in the early 80s. Was this a large-scale 'takeover' or was 79-82 just a really bad time to be in the Chicago mob? Im wondering if there was some kind of ""John Gotti Coup"" level event that took place.",e2149d
f9cwegg,too boring to finish at one time,e2149d
f8ykd5k,"I watched it last night and thought it was pretty ok. 

When I started it, I was like holy shit this is really three and a half hours long? But, the length didn't really bother me. The story and characters were interesting enough to keep me engaged and not wanting the movie to hurry up and end. 

Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa was easily the best part of the film. 

The de-aging was pretty distracting; especially the part where Robert DeNiro beats up the grocery owner for shoving his daughter. It looked like a 75 year old man beating up a guy. I don't get why they didn't get a stand in who could portray the beating in a more vicious and violent manner. 

Joe Pecsi was ok. He was very subdued. Actually both he and Robert DeNiro were very subdued in their roles. I don't recall either of them ever raising their voices at anyone. 

It probably isn't fair to compare this to Goodfellas or Casino, but I'm gonna do it anyway. There aren't any moments in this film that overshadow the ones in those two, and I think both Goodfellas and Casino are the better gangster films by Scorsese; but this was ok.",e2149d
f94c09t,It was so long. I liked it but I literally can't remember what parts go where and the time jumps threw me off at times. Probably doesn't help watched it after Thanksgiving dinner and another movie,e2149d
f8xoxum,"I found the film to be more intense than GoodFellas. Personally, I think it's up there with Godfather-2, on the same level. The performances of De Niro and Pacino held the film together. I think Scorsese was so desparate to cast them because he wanted to deliver something memorable at the end of all their careers. And they didn't disappoint.",e2149d
f9exe32,"I would like to make a comment about the whole marvel/superhero/""art"" discussions. There is definitely a mixed crowd of viewers commenting on this film, The Irishman. While everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion, I think it's important for everyone to recognize two things: 1.) There are a lot of people who watched The Irishman who don't watch superhero/franchise films. This film, is of GREAT appeal to that audience. 2.) Due to this film being marketed and 'distributed' by Netflix, this movie, The Irishman, is reaching the screen for MANY viewers who would 100% not have watched this movie if it weren't on Netflix and so easily accessible to them. Now, I fall into the former category. However, I think it's great that so many people who are seeing The Irishman that wouldn't have seen it if it weren't on Netflix, are viewing it whether they like it or not. 

With that said, not all films are the same, and with that, they shouldn't be judged the exact same way, in my opinion. If you don't watch films that are similar in nature to how The Irishman was written and directed, then to be honest it's pretty likely that you aren't going to like The Irishman. If you grow up eating in an Asian household every week, and every night your mother or father is cooking cultural food and that's what you predominantly eat, chances are that will be your favorite food and you might struggle to appreciate French food and you might actually hate it the single time you eat it. Alternatively, if you grow up in an Italian home, and every night of the week your mother or father cooks an Italian meal, chances are as you grow older the first time you try Salmon Sashimi or a bowl of pho, you might hate it. Over time, if you give it multiple chances, you might begin to enjoy it, or even love it, but initially there's a good chance you won't like it simply because it's new, different, and something you don't understand.

My point is, your environment, your bubble, whatever you want to call it, shapes your perspective and opinion. If you don't like The Irishman that's certainly your opinion, but before you express that dislike, think if you actually just really hate it, or that you're saying you hate it because it's not something you're used to? I'll be the first admit to, when I have to watch a superhero/franchise movie, I'm not a big fan- but I do my best to try and understand/appreciate what is taking place on the screen in front of me. And if I don't like it (most times I do not like those films) I don't go around bashing them because it's more than likely my fault for not understanding the film at its core. Whatever your opinion of this film is, just try to understand that movie opinions aren't black and white. What is boring to you may be riveting to someone else. I've seen a lot of people say they were bored within the first 30 minutes. Me personally, the 3 hours and 30 minutes was a breeze. I didn't take my eyes off the screen once, and it felt like it was barely a 2 hour movie. I've seen 2 hour films which felt much longer than The Irishman did.

Again, everything is dependent on your perspective and please just try to understand that everyone has a different one than you do. There are so many cut and dry comments regarding this movie ""it's boring, it sucks"" etc which is disappointing because movies are far more complex than that and shouldn't be discussed so simply.",e2149d
f8v53pr,I’m so fucking depressed rn,e2149d
f8v6l6p,"Perfectly structured. The way the film is set up makes you think they're retired, or at least out of the game when the film starts and they're driving up to the wedding. Then they call Hoffa and you know exactly what's going on. And you're stuck watching as Frank destroys whatever soul he had to keep operations running like clockwork. And for what? Everyone was dead within the next 10 years or so. Except for Frank. He long outlived his usefulness and had nothing left to offer. His family (rightly) ostracizes him. So he just exists. But he's so scared of death. A fate he's doled out to countless individuals. A man who deals in finality only lives now to stave it off as long as possible.

f8wshqx,"Like many probably I've been fascinated by this movie and have watched it twice already (first time in the cinema, actually liked it more the second time on Netflix), not living in America and being familiar with the Hoffa story I'd really like to know: How moral was Hoffa? The movie kinda makes you sympathize with him, and Al Pacino's acting really makes the character very likeable shown especially when he, in comparison to Ruff, connects with Peggy. How involved was he in the mob side of things though, did he know of the killings that came with it? He is portrayed as someone who stands firm in his principles (""It's my union"") until the very end, but he also must have known the consequences of his connections to the mob, no? Also how close was Pacino's acting to Hoffa's behaviour? 

It's weird because the movie really makes you sympathize with Hoffa, but then you read his Wikipedia and it's full of shady dealings and the whole Bobby Kennedy investigation etc. doesn't paint a pretty picture of the character.

Or is it that the movie is based upon the character of Frank Sheeran mainly so maybe it was Frank Sheeran's way of making up for his sins in the end by painting and glorifying Hoffa so much in his writings? That would explain the ending where he reminds the caretaker who Hoffa was, so maybe his way to atone by holding up his name for the next generation?",e2149d

God, I don't know why I love that. 

Also, now that I'm thinking about it, I feel like I haven't seen De Niro speak this much Italian since Godfather part II. Even if he is playing an Irishman who learned Italian in the war, both the scenes featuring Pesci and De Niro speaking Italian satisfied me to NO end as fans of the two of them.

I'm not big on mobster movies and scorsese Movies, I fear it could have worked better if i was, but i loved this anyway

Sure, I have the attention span of a dead unicorn so I had to take a break after the first 90 minutes, but I really like that so many themes are showed but not fully explained, feel like there's a good symbolic value that doesn't necessarily lead to a drawn out explanation.What do you think was the point of the ""sacred"" part of this movies?It really struck with me that they "" poured the wine and broke the bread"" when they were old and in prison, while before they would go to church but never act like christians? Was that the point?That through punishment, and not having to fight for power anymore, they can get some kind of vicinity to the christian values?

The ""just executing orders"" theme is always depressing, too...

I really liked the final scene with the door too, felt like was a good mirror of De Niro personality.

De Niro and Pesci's Italian was very good too, didn't know they speak it so well, really helped the movie for me.

Felt like it was great acting, but I don't see really discussed, the character of Provenzano. It really felt a good rapresentation of an italian hothead.",e2149d
f8xt5jw,"Epic Scorsese crane shots in creative manner? Yes. Subtle, slick editing and rich photography? Yes. Exaggerated camera-moves for dramatic effect with perfect timing? You betcha.  Smooth characters and terrific performances? Yes. Awesome dialogue? Aww, hell yeah. Al Pacino shouting a lot? He does. But not only that, he gives Hoffa more humanity and life than you could ever imagine. De Niro with a subdued and restrained yet moving performance, Pesci with a quiet, calm and powering performance of a lifetime. I didn't even see Pesci, I saw somebodies grandpa, he became that character, it felt so real, especially with the Christmas scene where Peggy says Thank you for the skates and then nothing for the money, Frank telling her what do you say? Russ Bufalino: ""Once is enough"".  


I thought it was great, they only issues I have are  technical aspects - such as composition (one occasion) and sound design (just two times). I know Frank is supposed to be tall right? And for most of the scenes he and Hoffa is the same height, but for the scene at the ceremony for Frank, they've framed it so Frank is meant to feel super fucking tall and overpowering compared to Hoffa, which I thought was a bit distracting since it wasn't established that well previously imo. And at the same segment, Pesci and Pacino talking (which was awesome btw) the sound mixing was a little low for the music, they're pretty close to the stage, yet it is super low and their dialogue is high. But this is like minuscule shit so whatever. CGI and body doubling can be spotted but since the story is great, it's not distracting.

To the next morning him telling Frank ""you're gonna go to Detroit"" i guess I didnt understand that, I felt like Russel mentioned in that morning dinner motel scene that he knew Frank wouldn't want a part of it, and also why even fly him to detroit? Frank made it sound like they could have driven there and been there anyway with enough time for Frank to do the deed?

Al Pacino. Marvellous, wow. My favourite scenes are ones with the cocksucker in the prison and Florida, lol.

Deniro played like every deniro character he does with that crunched up face and what am I gonna do look. 

Plus I hated the de-aging. Took me out of the movie a lot.


But at the end of the day and after all that damn hype, was this really amazing, the 10/10 movie everyone is saying it is? No way. The screenplay and script could be so much tighter! What happened to Scorsese. There were some gems in there like that humourous take on passing on info between Jimmy, Frank and Tony but you can see that this could have been snappier/quicker cuts. The cinematography wasn't anything special (I liked that assassination scene)and the background music was Italian mobster generic. 

Pacino held together this movie. He actually deserves an Oscar for it...great range shown. Right up there with the best work that he has done, which is not what I can say about Marty.",e2149d
f96lh4v,"Jim Norton's attempt at Don Rickles was an embarrassment.  They even looked up what his material was on that night to be authentic, but Norton was just being himself doing the lines.

Marty probably regretted hiring him after seeing the performance, but was obligated to keep a small piece of it in the scene as a tribute to Don.",e2149d
f9ww7j7,"I hadn't done much research about this movie besides watching the trailers and seeing the big star cast with Scorsese as the director.  The hype and long wait made me look forward to it.  I was expecting something awesome, but instead the whole thing felt like an almost comedic parody of movies like Casino and Goodfellas.  Everything from the color, the camera used to film, the cgi, the acting.   The only redeeming quality was Al Pacino.  This movie felt like Lifetime Movie Network made a gangster movie. 4/10.",e2149d
f8v1h5w,"Loved the first hour and maybe the last hour. The hour and a half in between had some great *moments,* but ultimately felt they could've cut from the script 30-50 minutes. Couldn't tell how the de-aging looked in full, I guess my modem didn't have the power to stream it in 4K. Definitely parts where their body language certainly looked elderly -- guess you can't fix that in post. There was a weird ""oil painting"" look on everything for most of the movie -- I asked someone else who was watching it a hundred miles away and they also said they saw it, but when I watched the trailer after on YouTube, it looked fine for the most part.  This falls right in the middle of stack for movies this year -- nowhere near as perfect as my favorites (Parasite, Jojo Rabbit, The Farewell), nowhere near the worst (Charlie's Angels). As a sum of its parts, and as much as I fully enjoyed 2 hours of this movie, it's weird to think there's another hour and a half that I felt mostly numb for. With that in mind, I can't grade this higher than a 6/10, maybe even a 5/10.",e2149d
f8vlnei,"I thought it was a pretty good movie and for something nearly 4 hours, pacing seemed pretty okay till the last half hour. That last half hour dragged and could have been summed up faster but the film could do with an hour of trimming, there were characters appearing left and right and then disappearing and it felt convoluted and messy. Like the mob boss who shot the italians activist.  That came out of nowhere and had no effect on the movie.  Would have preferred more of a focus on Hoffa rather than that.

Also it was great to see Pacino & Deniro be leads again especially Pacino.  Felt like 90s Pacino and it was a blast.

It was a mostly standard gangster film but I liked how it was a eulogy to the end of the Deniro/Scorsese collabs (most deniro scorsese characters ended up as failures), the end of the wise guy era and gangster films. As if they were a relic and it makes it all the more special.

However I do not think it is Best Picture of the year. That is going overboard.  I really hope it gets a bluray release though",e2149d

f91y693,"Since release on Netflix, it's taken me three separate sitdowns to finish the film, falling asleep twice.  This is perhaps due to prior exhaustion to prepare for the holidays.  I'll certainly revisit the film when I next have a 4hr block to spare.

I thought Pesci and Pacino were standouts, I didn't like the limited way in which SHeeran was written.  Felt too much like a blank slate.  Film was overlong, but I wouldn't cut it - every scene felt impactful and informative as to the overall plot.  Definitely more pathos when compared with Scorcesee's other mob epics.  A strong 7.5/10.

At first blush, it does not go above Goodfellas or Casino, but I'd like to get one more watch in!",e2149d

The ones who ignore that voice of ""right and wrong"" struggle to find meaning or any form of solace within their perception of their own lives.

f9j68b9,"Did anyone else notice the scene where everyone is obviously mourning Kennedy but Hoffa makes them run the Flag at full mast to the disgust of everyone around him? 

It was interesting to see that he was basically the only honest person in that room, he hated Kennedy in life and in death regardless of his position which is both horrible but honest. 

Just like the character, I don't think Hoffa had any regrets in his life as he moved with agency. I believe this is ultimately why Frank and everyone loved him, he did things his way when everyone else fell in line with the system.",e2149d

f9zrknv,"There were a bunch of audio mistakes throughout the movie that made it feel poorly edited.  When Dorfman's car was shot, it sounded like an automatic rifle but the spread of bullet holes was clearly from a shotgun.  In the scene when the baby was being baptized early on, the priest's lips weren't moving but his voice was still audible.  In the scene when Frank was beating the shop clerk, the kicking sound effect was identical whether he was kicking the guy in the head, in the belly, or when stomping on his hand.. it sounded like a bad video game when they only have 1-2 sound effects for punches/kicks.  I just expect a little better quality/effort from a highly produced and high budget film.  I'm only halfway through too, so I'm sure there are plenty more issues with crappy sound effects/audio.",e2149d

The whole mafia ties in Havana and involvement with the Kennedy's was crucial to the film and the mafia's power in general, seems alot of people didn't grasp the importance of this. The whole sequence where Frank travels to Detroit to deal with Hoffa was intense, very emotional. Solid film.",e2149d

f9ew0rb,"I'm seeing a lot of people saying ""Scorsese hasn't done anything different with this movie, this is just like all of his old work"" and tbh I find it pretty ignorant. Considering that his most recent film, Silence, wasn't viewed by many people, I doubt a lot of people who are intensely commenting on The Irishman even saw Silence. Silence is an incredible film (in my own opinion) and The Irishman has more in common from a film perspective with Silence than it does Goodfellas or Casino, despite how different the films are story wise. I would say that a good comparison to Goodfellas would be The Wolf of Wall Street in terms of style. The Irishman has many scenes where Scorsese just lets it breathe. Scorsese has evolved a lot in Silence and The Irishman, and it's incredible to see someone of such prestige and with so much experience remaining humbled enough to continue to adapt and grow in his profession.",e2149d
f9t9mm8,A lot of movie with nothing notable or memorable in it. It's like every other mob movie rolled into one. I like Scorsese but this is his 15:17 to Paris albeit with better acting. I was surprised to see this rated so high. 5/10.,e2149d
f9ti22f,"I gotta be honest.  The corner store clerk scene took me completely out of the movie, at least for now.  I'll probably finish the film this wknd, but I stopped watching, or at least stopping paying attention after that.  It is SO bad, I just don't understand how no one on the production team thought taking it out would be a good idea.  When I first saw it, I wasn't even sure what I was seeing.  I thought Frank was putting on a show for his daughter while the clerk played along.    It's just so weird.  

I'm nowhere near Marty's talent level, but it seems like a better idea would be for Frank to go in, say something to the guy, then report later that the family's groceries would be free from that point on.  Or show the entire fight from the outside.  Or something!  Anything but what we got.

I don't mean to make this post all about that, but it is very disappointing to see such a thing from one of my all-time favorite directors.  It's some Tommy Wiseau shit.  Wow.",e2149d

That doesn’t necessarily take the movie down a ton, but it’s hard to recommend a 3 and a half hour movie to anyone who has already seen The Godfather and Goodfellas. It didn’t seem like it offered anything new and if I’m being honest, if it was a full hour shorter I would be more willing to tell people to see it.

When it comes to movies like GoodFellas or The Irishman however, I have no idea what I'm supposed to be entertained by. Nor do I understand why people look up to these characters so much. Half of the time De Nero is just scrounging up his face and gesticulating uncertainly with his hands like he's doing an impression of The Godfather. 

Something that seems common to all of the mafia movies and shows is that uncertain and casual dialogue, the opposite of pithy and clever dialogue. 

When I watch the movie I'm aware that I'm seeing something of high quality or competence, but I never understand what it is I'm supposed to be entertained by. It's criminality in all it's mundanity.

With the callbacks to making Vegas, all the wiseguys... def some Casino/Goodfellas vibes. Even starting as a driver was a fun choice. 

Also obviously we all knew it was going to be, but a master class in acting, with all the talent, there was always the issue it might not work but everyone was incredible. Calm and collected Pesci was something else. Even all the side character were amazing, even fucking Ray Romano. Honestly, Deniro's voice when he was old and reminiscing, made me feel something.

Great film. Some odd pacing at some parts, but I think that was on purpose. Almost showed the boring-ness of the ""life""... something he never did in other films, but probably because studios never would let him to a 3.5 hour movie where he could do all this.

The movie kinda makes you sympathize with him, and Al Pacino's acting really makes the character very likeable shown especially when he, in comparison to Ruff, connects with Peggy. How involved was he in the mob side of things though, did he know of the killings that came with it? He is portrayed as someone who stands firm in his principles (""It's my union"") until the very end, but he also must have known the consequences of his connections to the mob, no? Also how close was Pacino's acting to Hoffa's behaviour? 

It's weird because the movie really makes you sympathize with Hoffa, but then you read his Wikipedia and it's full of shady dealings and the whole Bobby Kennedy investigation etc. doesn't paint a pretty picture of the character.

Or is it that the movie is based upon the character of Frank Sheeran mainly so maybe it was Frank Sheeran's way of making up for his sins in the end by painting and glorifying Hoffa so much in his writings?

I thought the lighting was really harsh, it felt like most scenes had a bright white light that was being blasted onto the actors faces.

f9ff9n9,"People on here are talking about only liking the first half, or the second half. While they are very different, almost seeming like they’re two different movies, I see it as a very long drawn out arc. 

Sheeran was following orders, doing hits, raising his family, all leading up to when he kills his best friend Hoffa. This is his point-of-no-redemption. The rest of the move is underscored and not as dramatic, even though it’s recounting some traumatic things (going to jail, wife dying, family isolation, aging), because it’s the moral inevitable. Sheeran is paying his penance for committing his absolute crime. 

Most movies the climax, most dramatic part is at the end- right before the resolution. In this movie the climax was in the middle, when Sheeran killed Hoffa.",e2149d
f8wo7yl,"Absolutely loved it. The editing in general and in the preparation and killing scenes was so good, no music, just the ambient sound.

f8xy9nw,"Seen alot of complaints online about it having too much ground Scorsese's treaded before.  Well, yes, in a way.  Definitely has a different tone at the end.. what a downer.  Anyway, if we're to be critical of Scorsese for doing a similar kind of film, what are we to think of essentially the entire industry cramming remakes and formulaic superhero films down our throats?  Seems one essentially condemns a whole industry if one condemns this film.

Anyway, I thought it was good.  I see why some people think it has some pacing issues.. it does.  A few more rounds of editing would have suited the film.  It's still really good Scorsese filmmaking.  Watching a film like this is depressing.. not just for the tone in the last act, but because it contrasts an entire industry which is not like this.

Patrick Boriello is the son of Bobby Boriello who was John Gotti Sr chauffeur & favorite. As well as Jr’s best friend. He was murdered outside his home in the 90’s. Patrick Boriello has had small parts in other movies. Could this scene, shot in a Catholic Church, symbolize the birth of the next generation Who will go on to be good people despite their fathers being corrupt or criminals? Idk, I could be reading way into this. It was just the way that Boriello stayed on the screen during the wedding scene. Good movie. DeNiro’s blue contacts were terrible. The scene where he assaulted the guy from the store was cringe worthy. But DeNiro did a wonderful job. Pacino was great! Pesci, omg so amazing. He was so good.

For some reason Al Pacino felt like the weak link to me, but maybe that’s just because he’s mostly just so...Pacino now, it’s hard to see him blend into any role. I thought Pesci was amazing, and I’d really like to see him at least get nominated for an Oscar, if not take it home.

I do understand what people were saying about Anna Paquin’s role. Obviously the children are not the focus of the story, but to put someone like her in your film and give her so much screentime and then ultimately only two lines, it felt odd to me.

I grew up hearing old mob tales and what everyone thought happened to Hoffa. This seems like the most plausible story that I had heard and read about in my time. 

I don't think 3 hours and 30 minutes were needed. It seemed as if it was more of a movie about aging and dying with secrets. It seemed more about regrets and mistakes that Scorsese and Deniro have made and have to live with; but more so how they are dealing with their own infamy, fame, and their pending mortality. 

It tried to make Frank Sheeran into a sympathetic character in the  way that Scorsese does best, by making him a victim of his circumstance and life and time, rather than having him take ownership of his actions and responsibilities in trying to be a complete human being. He used this well with Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Ginger in Casino. Maybe we as an audience are wiser now, or we just don't fall victim to believing that horrible people are always sympathetic, eventually someone out there did the horrible things they did because they are just a bad person and enjoy it. Maybe thats why Jordan Belfort made a good bad guy.",e2149d

CGI looks really bad and takes you out of the movie sometimes - and when I say 'bad' I mean 'Superman's moustache level bad'. You don't de-age people by just blurring out their foreheads. If you think you can't afford better CGI, just hire younger actors, that's it. And say what you want about Marvel, but they handle de-aging so well that it's scary. That said, it looks like Scorsese's recent back and forth sort of a beef with Marvel looks like a mediocre PR thing to promote his movie which, in my opinion, fails on so many levels.

But, come the fuck on. **Blood does NOT look like that**. If someone gets shot by a gun, blood doesn't just magically stick to a wall like a shiny-looking overlay. Jesus christ. 


Just compare the violence in this film to Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or Casino. Those movies were bloody and brutal. This looked sanitized and dreadfully fake.

f8wrrs2,"I see this movie as Scorsese's follow-up to Goodfellas: the vivid journey of the corruptible. It brought us along the romantic, ambitious rise to power among the greasiest of the Italian mob with all the murder, lying, and cheating Henry Hill showed us on the big screen.

While the special effects certainly have room for improvement (minus Scorsese's classic perfect bullet-hole-through-the-face), I do wish the movie felt grittier and more white-knuckled than the polished vibe that it had. For a movie featuring a labor union, there was a surprising lack of actual blue-collar characters, and considering the whole ""never trust a millionaire's son"" thing, I was hoping for some sort of class warfare.

By far the most emotional scenes were at the end with old Frankie finally playing bocce ball with his friends, picking out his own casket, and seeking an audience with Peggy at the teller station. It took a while to get here, but the narrative strength of a struggling, stuttering Frank really delivered the heartbreak with these scenes.

I did have a hard time getting into the story though, I hadn't heard much about the events of the film, and the way it's told can get a little confusing, as certain plot points are forgotten, only to be re-appear later in the film, same with certain characters too.

Overall it's a very bleak story, I found it hard to sympathise with many characters, they're all fairly horrible, and I think that impacted the film for me too, with Scorcese's other gangster films, the other main characters you could sort of sympathise with. But in the end it is a gangster film about real people, so I'm not sure what I expected haha.

Film also felt like it dragged in the end, I heard people say it didn't feel like a 3 and a half hour movie, but I did in certain parts, but I can sort of forgive that for Scorcese getting this film made in the first place.

How did Frank not have like PTSD or something from killing like 100 people. His wife was just cool with him divorcing her for a younger lady? I didn't get the Jimmy Hoffa killing at the end that was weird. All 3 main characters being like 90 years old through the whole film, even when they were supposed to be young, was distracting to me.

f8vpfur,"[https://letterboxd.com/ragereviews/film/the-irishman-2019/](https://letterboxd.com/ragereviews/film/the-irishman-2019/)  Author's Note: This review is meant to be comedic/elitist in tone, an exercise in style, mocking the traditional ""critic"" persona. Combined of course with my genuine thoughts. I pay no mind to karma or negative feedback. Enjoy.

""It's what it is"", says Russell Bufalino, head of the Pennsylvania crime family. After three and a half hours of watching three old men compare their peckers, I'd say that says it all. Never has such a banal colloquialism bore such weight.

For better or worse, this is Scorsese's Old Man Movie. Over just two films, he's gone from boofing coke into a stripper's anus to a retirement home. Literally the most depressing space ever conceived by humans. I'm in my twenties. Which one do you think I'd rather watch on a loop? Hit me when I'm sixty, and maybe I'll no longer relate to Henry Hill.

Of course, any accusation of Scorsese repeating himself is out the fuckin' window with two to the dome. Very few needle drops this time. Always well-placed. Gotta love those transitions that make you feel like you're swimming.

But Christ, where's the excitement gone? No ""yippee, boy howdy, I'm a gangster!"" schtick here. This movie's old as oak, even dead at times. The criminal acts are drained of passion. It's a long kiss goodnight.

As you can infer from the title, our subject is one Irish hitman named Frank Sheeran. Frank is just a man doing his job. Some men are hardwired to feel nothing, to know their limits so well they never test them. Herein lies the tragedy. Frank is a man who just lets life happen to him. As he states early on ""Whatever happens, happens."" That may sound hard as fuck, but see what happens.

Despite being in every scene, Robert De Niro has never been less commanding in a role. He probably had more charisma in Dirty Grandpa. I wouldn't know. I didn't see that infested rat turd.

Conflict! He's caught between two great men. And by great I mean powerful.

Let's begin with Al Pacino's Al-Pacino-y take on an American icon. Can't lie, I prefer Jack Nicholson's portrayal. More steel, less magnolias. Of course, Hoffa (1992) was a weaker film.

While I may not buy Pacino as THE Hoffa -- too guinea -- I buy his character, whatever he's trying to be. He's a faint, almost feminine kook. The thing about Hoffa was, at least had a vision. Strategically, dumb as a stick.

But who gives a shit about honoring the legacy of a pighead union boss? All Scorsese cares about is giving these strange men their long shadows. Gotta have priorities.

As a side note, lemme go on the record as an Italian-American. It's a little amusing watching two well-known eggplants pretend to be micks.

The female roles are small but purposeful. There are a number of fun cameos that I'll leave to your surprise. Yes, this is a spoiler-free review.

Joe Pesci is an epic force of nature. Who can deny he is one of the most consummate actors of all time? He does a total about-face from the hyper-violent joker we love. He ain't about that life no more. Russell is soft-spoken and sinister, a true 𝘶𝘰𝘮𝘰 𝘥'𝘰𝘯𝘰𝘳𝘦. His presence looms even in scenes where he does not exist. You can tell by the poster. Pesci deserves the Oscar. Pray to him. God bless.

Shout out to Saint Thelma; the editing of this picture is without flaw. If you get the chance to see it in a theater, you might hear laughter whenever a joke comes up. It is then...the film takes a pause to let the laughter dissipate, before continuing to the next line. What is this? You actually CARE that we hear what they're saying? Could you imagine The Avengers doing that? Fuck Iron Man with an iron dildo.

Now in order to make a review proper, I had to get the official Netflix treatment. I saw it twice. I look forward to a third round.

It's in the Netflix format that you'll get to observe the de-aging FX with a magnifying glass. I'll give 'em a pass. I believed them, and I know why. They were applied meticulously and sparingly. Less is more.

Sure, at times the body language is 75 when the character is 45. We can blame De Niro's arthritis. But let's not pick each other's assholes too hard.

Besides that, the scenes are mostly great. Screenwriter Steve Zaillian admittedly manhandles a couple passages. Though he's penned a number of classics (Schindler's List), when it comes to mob dialogue, he's no Nick Pileggi. Still, this is no Goodfellas and it's not trying to be. It's what it is.

I can't wait for some Reddit weasel to get all antsy over this review. They'll deem it ""pretentious"", as they review MY review, going way beyond an up or down vote. Please, for your own sake, scroll along to your little echo chamber. Life's too damn short.

Let me close by stating the obvious. This is one of the year's most fascinating films. You ask how good? I say, \*hand gesture\* GET DA FUCK OUTTA HEAH!",e2149d
f8ygagc,"I have to admit I am not a fan of mob movies -- I just can't stand the characters (or the type of real people they represent). I know it is sacrilege in the film world, but I have never gotten through the Godfather for this reason. That's right. Can't. Watch. The. Godfather.

So, in the spirit of trying new things, dialed in The Irishman on Netflix and.... was done in 30 minutes.

Too harsh? Does it get better? Is there a payoff by the end that transcends the genre? Is it worth 3+hours of my life? 

Edit: Added the 3 hour part. I don't mind some long films, but 3 hours to me means it better be absolutely worth it.",e2149d

f8y40f5,Meh. Saw this in a limited screening (read: independent cinema with a tiny screen and basic 5.1) and its nothing special. Creaky old actors with some bad CGI and nothing gangsta that makes the film stand out. Had absolutely no nudity or fucking which was just odd. You could write a book on thematic elements and shit but fuck me film is supposed to be entertaining. This was not.,e2149d

The younger De Niro scenes just didn’t work and it was comically bad how old he moved I know he is old but they should of just used a double or cast someone else.

The style,direction,production was amazing but this film could have easily been edited down to 2.5 hours.",e2149d

But I watched it all on Netflix. In parts. That deaging tech was pretty good. I could barely tell it was CGI.

I enjoyed the movie. It was pretty good. But it kind of sucks that Frank's daughter never came to see him. At the last shot I was hoping his daughter would be outside his room standing there. And then they would cut to black. But no. That didn't happen.

Damn. Maybe if it was a Disney flick. Who knows.",e2149d

fa0b6lf,"He literally dug his own grave. His last efforts at connecting with his kids, at any kind of redemption really, are slowly stripped away. The ending is like the Nazi prisoners holding out hope they might not die before the inevitability of it all comes crashing down upon them. He doesn't want to let go with all that hanging over him but he will and there's nothing he can do about it. This movie is a stunning accomplishment. I still can't get over how damn good it is. Some technical glitches and a few questionable moments with suspension of disbelief are the only flaws on this masterpiece. Ultimately its as close to perfect as third acts get in a trilogy. I can't gush enough.",e2149d
f961a8o,"Our sense or morality is the entire structure we perceive life and existence through. Everyone has a little voice that tells them what is right and what is wrong, and it is seemingly inherent within all of us. Some of us choose to listen to it and others ignore it.

The ones who ignore that voice of ""right and wrong"" struggle to find meaning or any form of solace within their perception of their own lives. At the end of the movie, Sheeran is a perfect example of this. A man who went through life with no moral compass, and ended up a confused monster with no spiritual core.",e2149d

Then he tells Russ Hoffa is thinking about it. What I got from that is that Russ picked up that Hoffa wasn't going through with it. So he makes a phone call. My guess is he threatened Frank's family (specially peggy) to make Hoffa go through with it, because he noticed Hoffa really liked the girl. You can also see Frank is a bit incredulous when Russ tells him Hoffa will meet them because he knew he was so adamant about not goin through with it just minutes before.",e2149d

I reflected on that, Scorsese did nothing to hide it was coming, he all but spelled it out with a few scenes at the house before.

f91hcod,"Man. Brilliant. The one word that comes to mind with this movie is: subdued. No long drawn out emotional scene, Jimmy doesn’t have a moment where the audience can tell that he knows his friend will take him out, it just happens. I loved the subtle, gripping, very brief moment of fear Jimmy has ‘Frank let’s get out of here’ morning then boom its over. 

Which is why deniro was so good in this bc we see and feel all that they his eyes only. Like when Jimmy says ‘you may need some bodies bc they might come after you bc you’re with me’. Deniro’s face",e2149d
f9oqw0m,"I would disagree that it shows his lack of soul. Everything leading up to the killing indicates that Frank is extremely torn about the decision to kill Jimmy (attempts to warn/convince Jimmy and stall Russ/Salerno, his body language, the sleepness night before the killing), though as a hitman he is good at keeping his emotions in check.

In the end, Franks knows that Jimmy is a dead man (""it is what it is""), regardless of his participation. He ultimately goes along, partly out of duty to Russ, partly to protect his family and Russ (who indicates in prison that it was either Jimmy or them), and partly to ensure that Jimmy wouldn't suffer a cruel death. In other words, in Frank's mind it was a mercy killing and thanks to Frank, Jimmy ultimately never realized what hit him.

Frank only lost his soul afterwards, when he made the call to Jimmy's wife Jo, feigning his ignorance and keeping her forever second-guessing what happened to Jimmy. 

"" What type of man makes a call like that?""",e2149d
f94klkr,"It went down just as described in the book. I was also worried when I saw Frank standing behind Hoffa with his gun out that the movie was gonna try to force a moment between them but I’m glad they didn’t. Shame on me for doubting Scorsese.

f9o1i6h,"This. I just watched the film last night and totally agree. Up until the very last minute Jimmy trusted frank and felt safe with him. What’s even worse is how Frank killed him in such a cold manner. To me, this shows how Frank was never his own man. He acted as if he was this big bad tough guy but really he was weak. It would’ve been honorable to die standing by Jimmy then to betray him like that, and for what? His lifestyle cost him his best friend and he lost his family in the process. Now he’s old and alone.

Hoffa played it fast and loose like a mad dog that got off the leash and it was up to Frank to put him down. Is a professional killer, and his life isn’t in ... its back home where the mob is. Like Pesci says in the end. Something like yeah I like Hoffa but, “Fuck em, I chose us” Pesci isn’t as charismatic and likable like Hoffa but him and Frank are basically family.

Pesci was subdued and didn’t fall into Nicki Santoro from Casino

Deniro as Sheeran was just a guy. Yea a killer and hit man but not a made man. He did well to not go full ‘boss’

And Pacino did well to capture Hoffa who, while he was a firecracker and powerful guy, also was not a made man. They did a brilliant job of never falling into the trap of making any of those 3 too ‘big’ for their respective roles (or sounding too Italian as jimmy and frank were not).

And even super old De Niro in the chair they’d CG his mouth to maybe cover flubs with the overdubbed dialogue or merge takes together or something. So so so distracting and terrible and should never have made it out of the planning phase as an idea. The tech is not there to do this. It’s too exposed, you’re looking right at it. This is is a huge movie and I can’t believe they let it out the door looking like this, they needed to find a different solution.

Really want to see that effects reel.

f8yud66,That final shot is heartbreaking.,e2149d
f8v4a1l,"> There is almost zero glamour in this movie. 

I think my favorite scene is the long celebratory banquet, and it captures this perfectly. Superficially, it is a coronation for Frank's life work, with important people attending to cheer and congratulate him on his life's work. And behind the scenes, you have Russell personally crowning him with the special ring. It's beautifully shot, luscious period scene, with great outfits, dancing, and music. All the ingredients are there for it to be the moment of genuine joy in the movie. 

And yet, it's completely hollow. In terms of plot, it's the staging ground for the turning point in Frank's life, when Hoffa's fate is sealed (""It is what it is, Frank""). All of the trappings of what should have been Frank's joy slide to the background, as Frank's undoing takes center stage. And De Niro's acting is excellent, he has this warm, almost naive smile he puts on as he's being congratulated, and it just starts to falter as Russell begins to hint at what is to come. He's trying so hard not to think about the truth of what's happening underneath that scene. 

The movie strikes such an incredible balance of being watchable and brisk, while being almost completely joyous. I'm sure some will reasonably be turned off by such a dark and long film, but the editing work is remarkable. The Wolf of Wall Street flew by, and was similarly well crafted, but having long cocaine fueled party scenes *really* helps. They had to keep up a similarly brisk pace, despite the actual subject matter being one man's tragic, failed, wasted, joyless life. Amazing work.",e2149d
f8w600f,"> I loved the white writing that went across each of the characters showing their fate. It almost exclusively happened when the characters were joyous and laughing, totally juxtaposing that emotion with what eventually happened to them.

I absolutely loved how dark it was, showing almost no upside to life in the Mafia.

My favourite scene to show this was actually the hit on Sally Bugs. He did nothing wrong and was killed purely because of someone else's mistake. Really hits hard how no one would ever be safe, even from their own 'family'.",e2149d

f8vkv7t,"Yeah that scene made me laugh out loud. Should have used a stunt double. It was a wide shot too so you wouldn't even be able to tell.

In general the old man walk was distracting but that scene was the worst",e2149d
f8xmap9,"De Niro was terrifying in the right roles from his youth because he has a very reserved presence, which could suddenly erupt into full fledged violence or animalistic rage, a la the beating / stomping scene in Goodfellas, Travis Bickle, etc etc etc.

I can see why Scorsese wanted him to act this scene out, because he was probably hoping for the same energy and afraid another actor wouldn't be able to channel it. But de-aging an actor'a face and fixing their posture can't account for natural limitations, and that scene was pretty hard to watch. It will probably become a meme.",e2149d
f8v16j7,It really stood out and was very awkward.,e2149d
f8vrpzb,"yeah that was like the one main scene that wasn't convincing at all. I think a big thing was when he was kicking, you could tell it wasn't actually connecting, but the sound effect still made a huge impact sound.",e2149d
f8xkre7,"Yeah that looked awful. Definitely needed a body double foe that. You’re telling me he kicked the shit out of that grocer with the speed of those kicks and punches?

But any scene of them as their younger selves just looked super off too me. Like the whole scene looked like bad cgi. De Niro and Pesci both look like they’re 5 feet tall for the first third of the movie, super distracting.",e2149d

While the faces looked good to me their bodies didn't move the ages they were portraying. That was the biggest uncanny Valley to me.  It was shocking for me to hear them specifically bring up focusing on thay in the little doc after the film because I thought it stuck out like a sore thumb.",e2149d
f8vah7a,Felt like this in a lot of scenes the way he moves is really noticeable. Obviously can’t be helped but maybe could have used a younger double ?,e2149d
f911md3,"I noticed it too but honestly I prefer it that way. It felt more real. We all know De Niro and no matter what de-aging techniques they use, we know it's him. I like that they didn't try to hide it.",e2149d

f8wmdyc,"Absolutely, had the exact same thought, it just looked off.",e2149d
f8wqwi6,"Definitely. Felt like that for the first 30-60 minutes. That being said, the phenomenal acting and storytelling just sucks you in and makes you forget.",e2149d
f90j485,"I just paused that scene to come to this thread to see if others also noticed how ridiculous it looked. He looked every day of his age during it. I get wanting to use the CGI technology to have the same actors throughout,  but cmon, use a body double",e2149d
f8wxvqw,Yeah that definitley stood out how slow it was.,e2149d
f8wummj,"Maybe it's just because I'm not very perceptive but I really didn't notice anything wrong with that scene initially. In fact, I forgot the de-aging was even there after about an hour.",e2149d

f8xg8bh,It was the chest stomp and bad audio that stood out the most.,e2149d
f94hml6,It was laughably bad; it looked SO fake and took me out of it. The only scene I thought was really bad.,e2149d
f91u9ii,"Also, the moment the grocer smashes through the glass door looked awkward",e2149d

f8zl3oj,The whole scene looked...off.,e2149d
f8vd2hv,"For a second I thought they were trying to emphasise the uncomfortable reality of beating someone on the street. When you see him land the first punch from outside the shop it's funny because it's so quick, but the laughs quickly subside once the clerk breaks through the window. The camera doesn't cut and we're forced to watch a guy who's clearly already got the message just get trampled on some more. It reminded me of the pistol beating scene from Goodfellas, only more upsetting. It's possibly the first gangster trope they take on in the film.",e2149d
f8x3p2t,I thought he looked arthritic during it and I convinced myself to suspend disbelief through the rest Of the film because I was loving it. It does mention at the end though that he had arthritis after the war however.,e2149d

f8ziy5m,I came on here just to comment on this. Cracked me up seeing this is the top comment.,e2149d
f9szwe5,It all started when he went to throw the guy through the glass. That glass was so fake that the guy hit the bottom corner of the one door and both doors completely shattered way too easily. Then those kicks to the face were bad but that first kick made me cringe a little bit. Must’ve been an honor for that guy to get badly beaten by Deniro though.,e2149d

f8vq26d,wasn't he in his 50s at the time of the scene? Didn't really look out of place to me,e2149d
f94ljt8,He mentions that he started developing arthritis in his spine during the war so that is my suspension of disbelief,e2149d
f90ms2c,Oh my god I literally just watched that scene and had to come to see if anyone else noticed it. I couldn't help but laugh.,e2149d
f91rfu1,Totally. Worst part of the film for sure,e2149d
f91wql1,"Haha - I said this to my wife since I immediately noticed and she didn’t notice. If that’s the biggest “flaw” with this film, I’ve got no complaints!",e2149d
f91yf3h,"Also the way Pacino collapses when he gets shot. How's a guy shot in the head still grabbing onto the door handle while falling down. His face was turned, they couldn't use a body double for that shot?",e2149d
f91zx35,Don't  you think a legend like Scorsese  wouldn't  have noticed that? I think it was meant to show like that.,e2149d
f91zy7v,LMFAO yeah dudes about to be a registered stuntman.,e2149d
f94oeli,"Lol, yup. That was pretty brutal. They should have used a body double. Especially since it wasn’t a close up.",e2149d
f96ozt5,"Yes, I said the same thing during that scene.  He looked so frail and slow when kicking that guy",e2149d
f9et0dg,"They shoulda done the Terminator Dark Fate method of getting look alikes and modeling them up with CGI to look exactly the same, then just have Pesci and Niro dub their lines for it, at least for the early scenes. Not sure if it got better in the 60s or I just got used to it",e2149d
f9rm37u,The audio edit was so mismatched that scene I thought they did it on purpose as a subtle gag,e2149d
f9tohi1,"Big agree! Due to him looking real senior, it really came off as ""unrealistic"" that De Niro beat up that guy. Scene stood alot out for me too, and thought about the same thing after.",e2149d
fa0o7tx,"Loved this movie, but this is the only scene I agree with the haters on. It looked ridiculous and took me out of the movie.",e2149d
faa2286,The entire film he looks old and fragile,e2149d
fewkvtz,It was so unrealistic I almost feel it was intentionally intended to be that way by Scorsese. Frank was telling his story and the real violence was diluted to non-realism in his version of events?,e2149d
f94yvgw,"Not just in that scene, in every scene with the age reduction CGI. He was supposed to be, what, 35 at his youngest and he's walking around like he's got a broom up his jacket the whole time.
  
I'm not a fan of the film, but then again I'm not really a fan of Goodfellas and this felt no different to me. Overly long, lumbering and with an ending that just peters out. It was an effort to watch.",e2149d
f8xnyg9,kind of reminded me of goodfellas where liotta played a 20 year old henry hill .... I mean the guy looked mid 30s and nobody gave a fuck lol ...just because its cgi people expected more I guess,e2149d
f91gxxb,Reminded me a lot of the terrible fight scene from The Godfather where Sonny beats the shit out of his brother-in-law. And just like that one I’ll just have to excuse it because the rest of the movie is great. Lol,e2149d
f8xph5o,What an absolute fucking joke this sub is that this is the top comment! An instant classic and this is the top comment.. Fucking embarrassing...,e2149d
f8vrz2e,"I noticed the parallel between the two shots, and I definitely believe it was a callback to Goodfellas, but I read it differently. 

In Goodfellas, Pesci has an “Oh, No” moment, realizing his fate. 

In the Irishman, I think it just showed how arrogant Hoffa really was; he didn’t even take the time to look at the plastic on the floor. He just headed straight for the door. 

Hoffa was standing in his own grave like the German Soldiers earlier in the film, still believing that he could walk out alive.",e2149d
f8v1o4a,[removed],e2149d
f8xbehm,"I could be wrong and looking into it too much, But when De Niro opens up the freezer doors on the truck towards the beginning and it's empty, seemed like the scene in good fellas when they open it to find the bodies at the start of the ""Layla Montage""",e2149d
f8wltc0,"This is certainly up there with my my favorite performances of him. He was just such a colorful character, you could see how Pacino enjoyed playing Hoffa and I absolutely adored every second he was on screen.",e2149d

f8vz8d8,Yes! Finally someone mentioned the blue eyes. They looked so much glossier than everyone else’s.,e2149d
f8vtixb,I'd say he could pass for late 30s-early 40s in the beginning scenes.,e2149d
f8wr177,"There's a scene where one of his eyes looked sort of cat/lizardish, very odd.",e2149d
f92ecqr,The contacts bothered me more than the de-aging.,e2149d
f9ibf5i,"Just watched it yesterday. I realize this thread is nearing unanimous praise for the movie, but no one seemed young. Everyone was old the whole time. Even during the de-aging scenes, De Niro was lumbering around like an old man would. Pacino looked 60+ the whole movie but supposedly he was playing 39 for a lot of it. The blue contacts were also wacky, and I got distracted by them a lot.",e2149d
f9200fu,He looked like a white walker.,e2149d
f8vull9,"Yeah, the blue lenses looked very weird. Kinda reminded me of De Niro in Angel Heart.",e2149d
f8xl84k,All the younger stuff he looked like a youngish head on an old man's frame. They all did.,e2149d
fcql883,"The de-aging thing was weird because as men age their ears and noses get bigger and they didn't shrink them for the younger versions. We know what younger Pesci and Deniro look like, so it naturally felt off. Still a technical marvel though.",e2149d
f94pgmb,The whole de aging and and blue eyes ruined the movie for me. Its was like watching a low budget movie. Why couldn’t scorsese just work with some different actors instead of these old ass dudes. Pacino killed his role and the aging did not bother me as much as de niro. Just wished we could of got something different.,e2149d
f8vu9i2,"The blue contact lenses were meant to have De Niro better resemble Frank, the character he plays. The de-aging is also an interesting case. I've seen the movie a few times in theaters and each time I went, the de-aging was less and less noticeable/important. Also, considering this is a story told by a man in his 80s recollecting on his life, it seems almost appropriate for the de-aging to improve throughout the picture (as his ability to accurately reflect improves). I would compare this to Apocalypse Now. The disorganized storytelling and production problems of Coppola's epic ultimately elevated to film to something that transcends the traditional Vietnam War to something much more.",e2149d
ff5mjtk,The CGI in this is scarier than the CGI in IT 2,e2149d
f8wgk73,"Yep someone else commented it had an “end of an era” feel to it, I definitely agree especially in the last hour where it’s clear that his dedication to the mob cost him everything.",e2149d
f92bpkp,"Yep, very dark and no glorifying here at all. Much like the last two seasons or so of The Sopranos",e2149d
f9frxhu,"What about when Frank goes to the dinner ""you first go to the bathroom, to see if you weren't followed or if there isn't anybody there to give you trouble, then you come out and whack Tony Sopra- sorry, Joe Gallo"".",e2149d
f9l7in8,"And supposedly Scorsese never saw it. But yeah, I agree.

Probably closest comparison is how everyone is there for Frank's banquet: Frank, Hoffa, Russell, Salerno, Pro, Angelo, the Razor, Buffalino Esq., his entire family. But in the prison, it's only Frank, Russell, and Salerno still alive. 

The Sopranos equivalent is when all the wise guys are outside Satriales in the end of an episode Season 2, all of them. Then in the final episode of the show it's another scene outside Satriales and it's just Tony and Paulie... >!Because everyone else is basically dead!<

But then to take it further too:

Frank is the only one left, he outlived his friends and his enemies. His family really never visits him.

Junior is basically in the same situation, with his mind deteriorating.",e2149d
f8wcai3,It was certainly reflective and mournful but it had some downright hilarious scenes and lines.,e2149d

f8v6xoy,[deleted],e2149d
f8xtu0w,"I loved that scene, but is it just me or was there a weird cut in the beginning of that phone call? Like it cut Deniro mid-line. Just a minor thing.",e2149d
f8v0op0,At least I cried less than I did at the end of Casino,e2149d
f8vsuju,"yeah, I was crying so much, it was just really tragic to see. The fact that it felt so real, and just seeing him slowly deteriorate like that",e2149d
f8w77r2,"I'd liken him to Nazi soldiers who excuse their cowardice because they're ""just doing what they're told"" and ""looking out for themselves.""

He's completely passive, yet that's what makes him so evil, because he lacks the conscience and will power to fight back when he's commanded to do something heinous. You can see that there's internal conflict the night before he shoots Hoffa because he's up late staring at the phone, but he's ultimately incapable of doing the right thing.

Russell knew as soon as Frank casually told the WWII story about shooting people that this is a guy who would do whatever he was told, and that's why he ""took a shine to him"". Frank was just a tool to use for his own ends. Russell had no genuine affection for him or humanity, in contrast to Jimmy, who was full of humanity. The contrast is revealed in the daughter's judgment, as she intuitively senses Russell's artifice.

For all the horrible tyrants and killers in history, their actions wouldn't be possible if they hadn't been enabled by passive participants like Frank, so this movie is an especially interesting portrait of evil because it focuses not on the mastermind, but rather on the cold foot soldier who just ""does what he's told"".",e2149d
f8whsgo,"It's really quite incredible. A lot of movie epics are about exciting, meaningful lives, but this is an epic about a man whose life was an abject failure. He killed countless people who didn't inspire a drop of remorse in him, he betrayed his only real friend, he was worse than absent in his children's lives and he just slowly gets older and more decrepit and just loses everything. He can barely even get the nurse at the end to stick around and talk with him about the old days. This is an epic about a man slowly digging his own grave and having no choice but to accept it and lay down in the cold.   


Scorsese couldn't have crafted a better eulogy for the gangster film if he tried.",e2149d
f91mov4,It's very interesting he didn't even seem like a real human being to me. Throughout the whole movie it felt like there were only 1-3 scenes where he is genuinely expressing himself. The rest of the time he is just present and passive,e2149d
f8xm3x9,"I loved how the movie (and De Niro himself) resisted the impulse to make him more complex or to portray his final days in a more melodramatic way. He's literally incapable of feeling strong emotion. He's not a full-blown psychopath but he's emotionally limited in a way that ruins his life and that of others. In fact, both he and Jimmy Hoffa succumb to the same problem: they're incapable of not being themselves. They can't resist their worst impulses. The great horror of the movie, for me, is that their fates were sealed from the moment they were born.",e2149d
f9myp0i,"There's a part of the character they never come out and mention, and that's the impact that being in the war had on the guy. He learned to view lives as expendable, like murder is just a job, because for him it was, in the war and afterward.

And maybe on purpose, like the movie, the character never really deals with or analyzes how that affected him. He's talking to his daughter at the end, trying to explain to her why he's done the things he's done, saying it was to protect them from dangerous people, and he's talking about it like he was killing nazis the whole time, because that's how he sees it, and her reaction, the look on her face seemed to be her saying ""Dad those weren't nazis, you weren't in the war anymore"".

A lot of people are going to see this movie and come out of it going ""The movie is saying that living as a mobster means you'll die alone"", when actually the movie seems to be trying to say something closer to ""Living as a monster of any kind means you'll die alone"".

And I appreciate that message, but it doesn't seem to address the fact that everyone else can suffer like that too no matter what they've done in life. You could be a perfect person and still get shot in the head in '81. You could be a perfect person and still find yourself alone in an old folk's home with only a nurse and a priest to talk to. That's... that's just how life is, sometimes, and the movie doesn't tell you that, or it doesn't seem to know it. His wife and his lawyer died from cancer, but the movie didn't give them ""death cards"", the movie made no morals about their final destinations as it did with all the mobsters.

Unknowingly, the movie seems to be suggesting that the only difference between living a mobster's life and living a just life is whether your daughters will come visit you when you're old. At the same time, Hoffa was a kind of a mobster in his own right, but had he lived to be elderly it seemed obvious that Frank's daughter would've visited him, as would his own family.

So it's drawing an artificial line between being a mobster that kids like and being a mobster that kids don't like.

I might add more to this later, I looked around and couldn't find any information on whether Hoffa served in any wars, and I don't remember the movie saying anything about it.",e2149d

f8v4ksr,"Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street are similarly lauded for how short their long run times feel, but they *much* easier material to work with on that front (cocaine fueled party scenes tend to make the time fly by). The fact that Schoonmaker pulled off a similar feat with *this* subject matter, an almost entirely joyless epic of one man's wasted, failed, life... is remarkable. Scorsese was careful to drain the ""joy"" from even the superficially celebratory scenes (like Frank's big banquet), and yet, this never felt like a slog (which even some movies I enjoy can feel like). The pacing of the movie was such a smooth glide, until the drawn out build up to the Hoffa killing, and the final act, both of which slow down quite a bit so you have to wallow in those moments.

f8xbbho,That was probably the funniest scene in the movie. Tense but still funny.,e2149d
f8xoj9d,"It was such a difference from his characters in Goodfellas and Casino too. Those guys were impulsive and erratic but Russell is so deliberate and restrained. Yet somehow he's more dangerous because this is a man who gets what he wants and can talk you into anything. He was such a compelling devil on Sheeran's shoulder.

And after not being in any films for a decade? It's a hell of an actor who can come out of retirement and give a performance like that.",e2149d
f947uq0,He was my favorite performance in the movie by far.,e2149d
f8vabul,"Excellent writeup. It's definitely about the unobserved life, which is why I think this is closer to Scorsese's catholic guilt films than it is Goodfellas or Casino (not that there aren't specific callbacks to those films). It's a lot like Raging Bull where Lamotta's inability to see the harm he's causing to his family tragically leads him to a point where it's too late to repent and have it matter. 

My only disagreement is that I do find the film wholly bleak. Obviously not all of us will die alone like Frank, but the ending has tinges of the same ending as Barry Lyndon: We're all destined for the grave, and that's a dark and lonely final destination.",e2149d
f8xof99,"I don't know why no one is talking about how De Niro is a complete pawn between 2 men who he considers friends. Meanwhile, they consider him nothing but a workhorse, a solider, someone who will do whatever they need - because he is too loyal.

His loyalty is what screws him over, his loyalty to these 2 psychopaths is what ruins his life. He doesn't use the money to buy anything glamorous, to live a life of luxury. He says it wasn't about the money, all those hits were about paying respect. 

And in the end, what does he have to show for that loyalty? All his ""friends"" are dead, and he's lost his family due to that loyalty. 

Essentially, he was a mob workaholic.",e2149d
f8vso35,"that's such a well written and great summary and it puts a lot of what I was thinking into words as well. It does really seem that across the narration, we're learning of Frank's life and how he operated, but he also just serves as this detached and distant observer to his own life, with it now being too late to change any of it at all. I found that conversation with his other daughter quite heartbreaking, his attempts to placate and justify his actions, but he truly was never able to see how his children were processing how he acted. Same goes with his conversation with the priest and simply being unable to say that he feels remorse.",e2149d
f8vy05t,This is the best examination of this film's themes I've seen yet. I think Frank's refusal to allow himself feel emotions was expertly shown through De Niro's performance when Frank realizes he has to kill Hoffa. He seems to be on the verge of tears through that whole section of the film but stifles his feelings. I think that this film will only become better the more I think about it.,e2149d

f8ysayl,"That's the thing: look a their plates. Frank's is still full of watermelon. He respects Hoffa enough to not touch it. And I think that's key: Hoffa's not stupid enough to not notice a drunk guy, nor not smell the Bacardi, especially when that goomba holds it up to his face and says ""Wanna bite?""

I think that's one of the things that endears him to Hoffa. It's a great way of showing it.",e2149d

ffd4x1y,"Given how openly affectionate Hoffa was her and so enjoyed her company, she probably felt that he more of a  father figure to her than Frank. 

She was already struggling with the knowledge of what her father did for a living. But finding out that her own father killed someone that she personally really liked must've been impossible to bear.",e2149d
f8xnal6,"I think Scorsese is one of those guys who lives by the motto that his best job is yet to come. He has so many classics by now but he still managed to do something as good as The Irishman. He has nothing to prove at this point. But this is a man that breathes cinema and loves it as much as he did in his first day.  I find this to be absolutely spectacular and a great inspiration for life, I suppose. 

He has nothing left to prove at this point. This is a man that has such a deep love for what he does, that's why he's such an inspiration to me. I wish I could be half as good as him at my 50s let alone at almost 80. He makes me want to pursue my passion, the way he talks about movies and how he's perpetually enthusiastic about making new ones is something to behold. I adore everything he represents. 

The fact that he was able to get this cast and make them feel wanted at their age, something that's not the case for most old actors, was a masterful decision. You could feel it in their performances. For the first time in years they were reminding us of how good they were in the past. You could see how invested they were in their characters. I'm so thankful for being able to watch these 3 giving us another legendary performance. 

Not getting other actors for the different life phases of their characters also proves to be a really intelligent decision. I feel like he didn't want to lose their identity even if the physical aspect isn't all there. If he had different actors portraying the same characters it could have felt like entirely different people. I didn't really care about the CGI as much as others did.

Their performances were so captivating that I'm thankful that Scorsese risked using this method. All the soul and the character of the people they were playing never felt lost. 

The last 30 or so minutes of the movie are genuinely a punch in the gut and even though I didn't felt much empathy towards Frank. I took that whole situation as a lesson and it's a damn good one. No matter how though you are, no matter how much you were feared in your entire life. At the end of the day, if you don't have love or anyone to share moments at the end of your life, it's one lonely and sad last ride.

Of course Frank's story is still fascinating to this day, ence why a movie about him was made. Nevertheless, his memory only lives on because of his wrongdoings. At the end, he's all by himself, only having a priest and a nurse waiting for his day to come. Abandoned by everyone. The final line of dialogue from Joe Pesci couldn't have been better. ""You'll see"" and you're sure as hell he got it in his last days of life.

I fucking love Scorsese, I fucking loved this movie. Just finished watching it now and I'm mesmerized by the whole thing. I'm sad that I didn't get to watch this masterpiece on theatre, but that's just a plus. When a story is as compelling and well done as this one you can watch it anywhere.

Sorry for the whole rant, just felt like I had to spit my guts out.",e2149d

f8x5djx,"Part of the fun in the beginning of the film, however, is specifically that it sets itself up as by-the-numbers.  As you move forward, you see these flash forwards that give the film a sense of inevitability; he survives, no one else does.  On top of that, you have the film careening towards the cross country drive they're taking.  

As the film approaches its midpoint, you can feel that shift.  This was just a good Scorsese film, up until then.  It was a polished, well-done rehash of everything that came before it, with snippets of what was to come.  But as soon as that dinner scene hits, the tone shifts.  Through the use of lingering shots, lack of score, drawn out scenes, and complete, utter silence - you have this impending sense of dread that hits like a freight train when the film finally catches up.  Then, it continues to drag out this betrayal for another twenty minutes, slowly meditating on how Frank can't even prevent himself from stabbing his best friend in the back.  The entire film shifts, utilizing the first half as a means of inviting the audience to both expect and assume ""another Scorsese crime epic"".

You could see it really hurted Frank for doing it but it has to be done, if he didn't do it somebody else would do it, he tried to help Jimmy but Jimmy was to stuborn for his own good and went against them, regardless how many time they warned him, i am ofcourse talking about the movie, don't know what happend in real life.",e2149d

fls07hv,"> Unlike the prisoners of war, Frank had a choice to stop digging.

'Digging your own grave' is a great way of describing one of the major themes of the movie, but to say the prisoners had no choice misses an important aspect of the theme. 

In Frank's opinion, they did have a choice; he wonders out loud why the prisoners chose to dig their own graves. ""Maybe they thought if they did a really good job, we'd change our mind about killing them."" 

We the audience can see the tragedy in Frank's comment, since the question it asks applies to everything he does over his lifetime. It also applies perfectly to Hoffa: Why does he consciously choose to ignore Frank's warnings, when it's clear that he's provoking his own murder? Hoffa essentially says that he can't stop being who he is, and if that means digging his own grave, so be it. 

The movie makes us ask why anyone would choose to dig their own grave, even when it appears that they have other options. It suggests that what looks like choices from the outside don't always feel like choices to the people making them.",e2149d

I watched it with no expectatinos, which usually allows me to appreciate the movie even if it's not my kind of.

So she knows his dad killed Hoffa. There was no particular moment when we were told that the confirmed this. But back in the party scene, she knows something was going on and Hoffa was in danger.

I'm right there with you. The movie is about looking back at your life and legacy, and coming to some uncomfortable realizations about what that legacy is. It's about the long journey and the long, slow decline. Choosing to really *dwell* in that was the right choice.

It could have been a tight, GoodFealls-esque romp through Frank Sheeran's life, but that would have been a much different movie, a much *lesser* movie, and not the story a nearly 80-year-old Scorsese felt any passion for telling.

-Frank, usually cautious doesn't make any commentary at all, he seems to be trying to hard to look comfortable, even by his standards.

-He gets to the house. It's empty. YOU NEVER enter an empty room when the mafia wants to end you. It's a death sentence. Jimmy knows he's going to die, but he's still in denial that Frank is going to do it, ""he wouldn't dare"". Of course he realizes he's going to do it, but could he? Until his last breath he decides trust Frank because he is one of his only true friends. Maybe after all it's all a big misunderstanding. He didn't even saw the bullet coming.

minimum wage rather than that good bank job she was afforded because of her private school education that her father paid for.  She seems to be enjoying that good dinner her mother cooked with the groceries Frank bought.

How many strippers would give their G-string for a dad that would defend their honor like hers did with the grocery store owner?  O.K., he went too far, but still.

This reminds me of the scene in ""Road to Perdition"", Where the son asked what did his father actually DO for work.  The mother piped up and said he was ""putting food on the table"".  That's enough of an explanation for offspring.  When they grow up and support their own families, they can do it however they want.  No one asked for Peggy's opinion, even if it was non-verbal.  His money is green like everyone else's.  That's all she needs to know at her age.  She should have been told to ride her high horse to her room for the night. That high and mighty expression annoyed me big time all through the movie.",e2149d

fakd4ab,"Think it was based on the actual dude, Frank Sheeran.",e2149d
f8v3qkh,"I just want to note that I ended up with a very similar reading to you about Peggy's line. ""Why?"" feels like the signature line of the whole film. Frank's inability to grapple with the question is his central failure, and the final act explores how he couldn't avoid that judgment forever (in usual Scorsese fashion, both in the sense of his family, and in the sense of his spiritual faith).

The connections between The Irishman and the rest of Scorsese's crime films are undeniable (and key to understanding the movie), but I see this as a crucial difference. Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street explore the ""Why?"" of Henry Hill and Jordan Belfort in great detail, and I think they come to pretty definitive conclusions. Goodfellas *starts* with the answer, with that beautiful opening scene showing how the mob could make Henry Hill feel accepted, important, and give his life meaning. Jordan Belfort's motivations are probably even less subtle, and the real work of the movie is in exploring how those motivations shape society (there's not too much nuance to the greed of Jordan himself).

What's fascinating about Frank Sheeran is that his is a very different kind of failure. There are moments when he just wants to be accepted and feel important, there are moments where he might succumb to personal greed, and there are moments where he thinks he's doing right by his family. But his arc is ultimately defined by passivity, not his motivations. He didn't succumb to greed, per se... he just was a deeply thoughtless man who never properly grappled with his own actions. His issue wasn't misplaced priorities, it was never articulating those priorities in the first place, and simply being a foot soldier in the work of other dominant men.

I wrote a much longer version of this in my other comment. I think this is exactly why the film is a weird mix of accessible and challenging to audiences. It's accessible because it's a sleek, technically excellent movie that wears its heart on its sleeve. It's quite sincere, and usually not all that subtle. And yet, I'm not surprised it will turn off some audiences because this is quite a different way to look at the failings of a protagonist. We are very comfortable with understanding how a character succumbed to their baser instincts, and could do evil. It's highly unusual to have an epic movie devoted to a protagonist whose failure is their *passivity*, and *thoughtlessness*. When we talk about legendary characters from fiction, that's *not* where we generally start.",e2149d
f8wo1nm,"> It's then I realized what she was doing this whole time. She was watching and processing. She was the silent quiet conscious always there to judge and question him because no one else did, not even himself.

I thought that was pretty obvious during the whole Frank’s award ballroom scene - she was watching all the players in the room go back and forth and talk about Hoffa because their eyes were always directed their way - she knew the man her father was, his friends, Pesci’s character.

It shows us how easily people can buy into that lifestyle if some charismatic figure comes along and sells us the ticket that'll supposedly win you the lottery.

And the biggest fuck you to Belfort was putting the real life Belfort in that scene.

Keep De Niro narrating but have a fiery younger actor to capture Frank’s early life because it did not feel like the characters changed and it had no energy.

f9oehbm,"I watched it twice and overall enjoyed it, because it is a very different take on the post-war mobster era than Goodfellas or Casino. And De Niro plays a very different character... a soft-spoken working stiff who has been seriously damaged by 4 years of war (in a conversation later in the movie he admits that after being in combat he lost his moral compass and his look on life). I viewed this movie mostly as a keen character study of an old guy struggling to come to terms with his past, unable to get rid of his habit of denial, and ultimately failing to find redemption. 

Storywise, I think Scorsese is trying to bite off more than he can chew/cram in a full-feature movie, by including an almost equally elaborate character study of Jimmy Hoffa and frame these guys' stories within a rather lengthy historic context, spanning about 3 decades. Casino felt more tight in that it was a more condensed snapshot (about 10 years?) with only one major historic narrative  (the mob using casinos to launder their money - and the Teamsters' money - against the backdrop of a changing Las Vegas, where big corporations were displacing the mafia). I think Scorsese could have pulled it all off again with this movie, if he had made it a series, but I still felt it to be a very enjoyable movie. This is clearly the most tragic movie of all three, a humble guy being loyal to a fault, >!who ultimately goes along with killing the one person that seemed to be the most empathic and trusting towards him (et tu Brute...)!<, becoming a social pariah of sorts.",e2149d
f9nzc3e,"The de-aging of De Niro and the rest did nothing to hide their body movements, which looked slow and pained. It would've been so nice to Scorsese to, *for once*, broaden his casting call and actually get some new blood to portray young Sheeren, Russell and Hoffa.

The CGI blood whenever someone was shot made it feel like I wasn't even watching a Scorsese film, but some made-for-TV mafia B movie.

The performances were pretty solid, *especially* Anna Paquin; as a testament to her acting prowess, she emotes through glances, stares and body movement since it was decided she didn't really need dialogue...for some reason.

Many, many parts just dragged on, like >!Hoffa's tirade against his crew where Sheeran storms out!<, or >!Hoffa's interaction with Tony Pro.!<Not saying those scenes should have been cut entirely, but there was definitely a lot of fat that could've been trimmed.

fb84g30,"I found this movie fascinating, and as such, I have read the book this past week - as well as watched a few docs with comments from Dan Moldea and others that were mentioned by the author in the book.  Anyways this now makes me an expert on the topic, so take my bone fides as you will...  ;)

In the movie, and then elaborated in further in the book, is basically the concept that when a high profile hit is done, more people are involved (though only those that you have absolute loyalty in) and they have less of a role so you can have further deniability as well as when the government squeezes someone, there are only so many beans to spill.  Basically, all Chuckie (step-son, though apparently in name only - Hoffa raised him) knew was what he knew - he was dropping his dad off for a high-profile mob meeting.  He only knows that.  So intentional deniability of those involved, even if they knew they were involved.  For example, the ""cleaners"" that disposed of the body perhaps only new they needed to be there for a body, and not Hoffa specifically.  Not sure if that's true, but just another example to highlight why Chuckie probably didn't know more.  They didn't go inside or wait, because of ""who"" was ""supposedly"" going to be at the meeting.  Air quotes there - remember, they were lying to get Jimmy in the car, so they said Buffalino himself was going to be there.  Rumors indicate that he was at the tippy-top of the national crime syndicate.  Chuckie didn't know this was a lie - but he did know that with Buffalino there (and others, but Buffalino was mentioned in the film) that this was a meeting well above his pay grade.  Even though Hoffa was high up, Chuckie was not - even by association at this point.  In fact, according to the afterword in the book and other more recent documentaries on the topic, Chuckie and Hoffa had a falling out and were on terrible terms.  At thanksgiving 1974, Hoffa apparently slapped Chuckie because Chuckie ran out on his wife and kid with another lady.  Also, Chuckie had zero poker face, couldn't be trusted with secrets, and was just a showboat and as such because of his character and behavior, on the lowest tiers of the mafioso pecking order.

So here's the theory: Chuckie was there to put Hoffa at ease.  Though if they had a falling out, why use him?  Because anyone, and especially the man who raised him (Hoffa), could read Chuckie like a book.  If Chuckie was spooked, Hoffa would be able to pick up on that.  So, the double whammy is Frank Sheeran - he was both there to put Jimmy at ease (though a surprise, a legit surprise with the lie of Buffalino now attending the meeting) AND put Chuckie at ease.  Sheeran is the confidence and Chuckie is the canary in the coal mine.  Hoffa was street smart, though weary by this point.  I think it's a mistake to underestimate the mob in this aspect - they were very, very dangerous, and very serious folks.  With a hit like Hoffa, they planned it well.  Of the 9 people involved, those that knew the most critical of the facts were very high up.  Sheeran and Buggsy.  Though there is a theory that Buggsy was actually an informant.  And that the ""bad hit"" Sheeran mentions in the conclusion scenes was actually a good hit.  The FBI, at this point, was starting to make serious inroads into penetrating the org.  Even Hoffa himself was an informant at the very end, or at least flirting with it.  Power corrupts - and what is corrupt in the eyes of a criminal?  To leak info to the good guys.  Hoffa wanted the union back so badly, he was going to work with the real enemy (of him and his friends) to get it.

Also, it's worth mentioning that during the time Hoffa was in jail, the outside world changed remarkably quickly.

Also, the cops grilled all these folks - 9 in particular, including Chuckie - and they all the took the 5th.  Reason: mob retaliation, various degrees of Omerta loyalty, etc.  These were all bad dudes to regular society and they all kept their mouths shut.  There are only 2 people alive today of those 9 who were involved - one one of the cleaners (supposedly they were brothers) and Chuckie.  Neither are talking, even to this day with literally everyone dead.

Edit: on my last point, Hoffa was going to go anyways, whether or not Sheeran pulled the trigger, they were going to hit Hoffa.  So I think a similar, cynical gangster frame of mind existed for the 5th amendment's in the immediate fall-out: telling the truth won't bring Jimmy back or change ""the thing"". Telling the truth will get you killed in that world.  Hoffa was scheduled to testify to Congress about JFK in the future; several of the characters in the movie who were labeled on screen as having been shot, people like Dorfman - all those murders were done because they were either talking or going to talk to the authorities.  Mostly just to reduce prison sentences.  There were a few killings that were power grabs (Angelo Bruno), but most of them were to silence people.",e2149d

It's one of Scorsese's slowest burns, and perhaps his most beautiful.",e2149d
f94pq4r,"I would say my couple flaws were maybe common ones.

Maybe the only thing I did find was that, despite being captivated, I never felt too emotionally attached. 

A few days earlier I watched Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (blind... didn't really even know the plot) and I know just enough about the subject matter that it really made the film rather dark soon as I realized it.... and maybe enough naivety/suspension of disbelief that I had no idea -- zero clue -- what route the ending would take.

So in the two most tense scenes... I admit I was really really emotional into it lol. Very attached to what would happen and it made the ending awesome.

In contrast, I had none of that in The Irishman. It was entirely captivating but it was all about the fascination I had with the plot, the acting, when it took time to show how details about simple things, heck, even the time period (one I find fascinating... was also one of my favorite parts of Mad Men, anytime a historical event happened and characters reacted to it), and so forth.

But never much emotional attachment. Which, to be fair, I never have had much for Scorsese films. Maybe somewhat in Casino just because I really began to root for a certain outcome, but even Goodfellas as much as I adore it (maybe my fave film) I don't think I ever got too attached to hoping for a particular outcome. 

So I'm not sure it's a flaw per se. But I did take note if it, maybe because of the films I had watched earlier in the week.

It wasn't totally absent though. I do admit I still really felt satisfied by the choices made by the main character. Gotta admit I felt he was pretty stone cold awesome by the end.

Other than that... only real flaw I felt was the fight choreography lol -- grocery scene that I now see everyone talking about.

Nothing else bothered me. De Niro was great IMO and truthfully I don't know if that specific role could have been acted any better (except for maybe a few 'young' scenes). I thought Pesci and Pacino had better performances but they had more to work with, too. 

Was also okay with the eyes. Didn't bother me and a few times I appreciated the effort to at least try do that.

Only thing that stood out to me was whenever De Niro tried to do too much action. Looked old. Grocery scene also stood out to me (before I knew anyone had cared about). Looked like it was truly a 75 year old man trying to kick a box. A few other scenes like that where he looked like an old man ineffectively trying to shoot a gun or walk at a brisk pace...

But I admit it never bothered me. I took note but... I was so fascinated by the film in general that maybe I even appreciated that they didn't try use a double/CGI to improve it, and that they like De Niro do it all ....

Maybe there was a certain 'swan song' element to it, even ... appreciating that all these guys are coming back and owning every part of it (the good parts but the bad parts too). 

It felt real... and in an era of too much CGI-everything, I appreciated even the blemishes of De Niro's action acting. I kinda appreciated that they went into the film set on doing owning every scene themselves -- the good and the bad, that every shine but every blemish would be their own, like a final crime epic swan song.",e2149d

2) Crazy Joe? He was an up-and-coming mobster with some fresh ideas that were riling up the traditional mobsters. He made fun of / belittled Pesci’s character for wearing the Italian Heritage / Christopher Columbus pin so Frank offed him for Russ.

3) They wanted Hoffa to relinquish his influence over the unions so that loans could be released to the mobsters for their business ventures. Hoffa still had a lot of power and influence but very little actual control.

ffxauon,"Not sure who Domenick is and why the deal with him is bothering you so much... I feel people on reddit and especially this sub are needlessly criticizing and overexaggerating flaws in the movie. This movie is Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas for me, it is the ultimate mob film. I understand that the CGI wasn't amazing, that the pacing at times was off (some scenes should have been extended specifically the one where they dump the taxis and other should have been cut) and the aging of the characters/actors was off for example how the wives seemed like they were in their 30s or 40s while Frank and Rusell looked like they were in their 70s. But these are such minor details that have little impact on a few scenes... in the bigger picture, the movie was absolutely brilliant. It cuts right through the mob life and shows you how it really is. If anything, this was a continutation/sequel to Goodfellas showing what mob life and killing even a person can do to a man.

If Unforgiven was the end to all western movies, this was an end to mob movies as I see it. And some people are saying that the movie had no memorable scenes or that it was too long? Some of the scenes are so great and hit you so hard when you watch them especially if someone who is aging... the final hour of the movie has so many great scenes that people will remember for a long time: Frank killing Hoffa, Russell talking about church, Frank confessing, Russell being unable to eat bread, scenes between Peggy and Frank, Hoffa talking to Russell and Frank at Frank's award ceremony.

Finally, another criticism I hear of Irishman which I find utterly ridiculous is how Peggy had such few lines - people blaming Scorsese for being sexist. I do not understand how one can actually believe this... Peggy hated her father and as a result wanted nothing to do with him or his bad friends (Russell) hence she avoided talking to them. Whenever she meets Hoffa, a person she thinks is good does she actually talk. And Peggy being silent with Frank just builds the tension between the characters, and once she asks 'Why' in that one scene, the tension climaxes and makes for a great and incredibly emotional scene.",e2149d

But yeah, The Irishman was an absolute drag. If this was the exact same movie without Scorsese's name attached to it, nobody would be praising it. Despite the bad CGI, I actually thought DeNiro and Pacino were pretty good in it. But the story just isn't interesting enough to constitute 3.5 hours of anyone's time.

The funniest thing for me is Scorsese was crying about how Marvel movies aren't ""cinema"". But the truth is, ""cinema"" changes with time. And this movie may have been the final nail in the ""Scorsese Cinema"" coffin.",e2149d
f923c05,"The whole film sort of felt like a mix of Goodfellas and Godfather to me.

f91j7jj,I know how he felt there. Sometimes you are so lonely you leave the door open in hopes that someone walks by and sees you’re in there and comes to chat with you. Think Frank was still hanging on for Peggy to come visit him and listen to what he had to say. Extremely moving ending to probably one of the best films I’ve ever seen.,e2149d
f925laa,"While he was picking out a spot in the mausoleum, there was some narration about the finality of cremation and burial. The priest closing the door would bring an end to their meeting, by leaving it ajar it shows both his loneliness and desire to live at least one more day.",e2149d
f91r2r3,"Not necessarily. Frank would leave his door open before he even met Jimmy, that's how his daughter caught him with his gun. I think the door being left open was in reference to Frank wanting to be someone and the same goes for Hoffa. They led risky lives because they wanted to feel like they were part of something. Jimmy definitely loved himself and Frank looked proud when reading about his hits in the newspaper. In my opinion, the door being left open was symbolism for wanting to be noticed by the outside world, and it came with a hefty price.",e2149d

Didn't feel tight like most other Scorsese films.",e2149d
f92qqrg,Think the point was he was talking to the writer of the book which was meant to be the perspective we were getting the story from and that this interview was a day or two before Frank was going to die so he finally felt the compulsion to share the story.,e2149d
f92hir9,I think it was knowledge of Sally Bugs history in sitting in the back seat of cars. His genuine anger about what was about to go down and wanting to be in control of the situation. And I think he wanted to sit next to Jimmy in the last moments of his life and not make him sit next to Sally Bugs.,e2149d
f9326i6,"I was under the strong impression the whole scene was a misdirect for the audience. Russ told Frank not to call Hoffa and they end the next scene with him lying in bed staring at the phone like he's strongly thinking about it. Then, in the car, you're wondering if maybe Frank did call and that since he and the audience knows Bugs's MO is to strangle from behind from the backseat of a car, he might have set up the whole fish thing with Hoffa and Chuckie in advance so that Frank could stop the killing or kill Bugs himself to save Hoffa somehow. I mean, we all knew Hoffa was going to die, but the whole scene made you think maybe Frank would at least try to save him first. This also explains the scene with Bugs acting so suspicious and why Chuckie couldn't seem to answer any basic questions. It was all to hype up the tension for the audience who are thinking Bug's is going to figure out he's been setup.",e2149d
f934afy,To add to what everyone was saying there were rumors he was in on it. Pretty sure he is an adopted son and one of the main suspects in Hoffa's murder if it wasn't the Irishman or both as an accomplice.,e2149d
f92y5wq,"Yeah I was wondering that too. Also, why did Frank refuse to sit in the front seat? Is it because he didn't want Bugs to be next to Hoffa in the back where he might kill him?",e2149d

I didn't have any trouble picking things out, but for the door thing, my mom said, ""Aw, he's lonely"" at the end and did not make that connection - and can you blame her? It was like 2 hours before, and there were hundreds of details and names and places and people in between the two. If there was a chekhov's gun test, this movie would fail it. It was indulgent, and almost felt unedited. There were more than a handful of scenes that actually hurt the movie, and I think there was a solid hour of footage that could have been cut to improve the pacing and reduce the gratuitousness of some of the story. Like, yes, the watermelon/taxi/whatever interlude sets up pacino and deniro meeting, but it could have been accomplished so much faster and more deftly, using the exact same footage just edited differently.

f8wot5d,"Indeed. Peggy's silence was *way* more potent than any dialogue would have been.

More importantly, her silence was *really damn important* to the themes and message of the movie.

She's vital to saying what the movie has to say, and her silence is a huge part of that.",e2149d

f9h9m7b,"Criminal organizations always have their own thing in regards to jewelry and iconography where each item will have a certain meaning, usually in regard to status.   The ring is basically showcasing Frank's status as a fixture in this underworld they exist in and it essentially transcends race.   As you might be familiar, mafia is very particular about keeping the bloodlines pure so Frank was never a member of the mob, just an associate or someone who had allegiance to it but being Irish-Italian prevented him from being a full fledged member of the ""family"".  The ring on the other hand suggests a sort status symbol for very particular individuals in the underworld, regardless of their affiliations, bloodlines, race etc.  This is why I believe Russ emphasized the scarcity of the rings and Frank's race when giving it to him.  Having that ring, when other people part of that underworld see it, will know where Frank's status is and that he's ""untouchable"".  And the fact he's Irish and in possession of that ring likely adds more weight to its aura.

The Den of Geek article does a pretty terrible job of not explaining at all what the fuck the ring is so don't even bother with that link.  If you want a better idea Google Mafia Iconography or Cartel Icogography and you should stumble upon similar practices within these syndicates.",e2149d

But this story seems to be hit and miss based on official information, so its hard to say. 

From what I gathered (from the movie), Hoffa might not have been offical mafia, but he was definitely someone supported by them. Hoffa seems to have made the mistake of thinking he was bigger then the Mafia and just as powerful. If movies are to be believed, we know better and anyone who steps out of line can be removed.

Mafia had interest in keeping the teamsters working for them, but then Kennedy came a long and there was bigger things to look at and they already had a replacement for Hoffa.",e2149d

f91xbii,"Yes sir, i do. And i also do my own carpentry.",e2149d
f9473fh,"My take, although someone who has read the book may know more:  

1)  Russel had to ""make"" Frank do it, basically implying that Frank would be killed if he didn't do it, saying ""he (Hoffa) is going either way"".  By forcing Frank to do it and making his life the price to be paid if he didn't, Frank couldn't stop it, or else it would be suicide.  And this suicide would be for nothing because Jimmy was getting whacked with or without him.  

2) I don't know.  Maybe it was some subtle message to reassure Frank that Russel wasn't sending him off to his death, that he was expecting him to return.  

3) I think this just goes to show how much Jimmy trusted and loved Frank.  Look at the way he hugs Frank when he gets in the car.  The idea that Frank could betray him was probably incomprehensible.  

4) I think this serves as a great way to contradict the mood that was building up in Frank until this point.  We are heading to the climax of the movie and he is about to go whack the person who means the most to him, and meanwhile these guys are having a completely unrelated and pointless conversation.  It makes the audience laugh while we arrive into the murder scene, sort of highlighting the ""banality of evil"" that has been described elsewhere while also just letting us enjoy some much needed wiseguy dialogue and humor after a very serious half-hour or so, before the movie dives into its darkest chapter",e2149d
f94maf5,I think he takes Frank's glasses to make him look less suspicious to Jimmy.,e2149d
f946qp7,"1) Basically he only tells Frank at the very last minute that he is going to have to go and kill Hoffa so the chances of him backing out are lowered, that's what he means when he says that. If he told him a day in advance what he was going to do Frank could have backed out.

3) Yeah he was, Jimmy was clearly caught off guard and uncoomfortable but he trust Frank so much that he'd still go with him anyway. If he didn't show up at all it would have been a much bigger red flag for Jimmy (remember part of the condition for Jimmy going to the meeting was that Frank was going to be there).",e2149d

f8vfqnh,"> Maybe it’s because I’m reaching middle age and it made me aware of my mortality and my flaws in ways that made me feel uncomfortable.

I think that this was not really a mob movie. Scorsese used it as telling a story of mortality. That's why he didn't want to agree for younger actors playing those roles. He wanted those people playing from the start to end to show how slowly they are turning from young confident man to old guys who can barely walk and pray to god cause they are afraid of what will happen soon.",e2149d

He's living in a different world than you and me and he played by the rules of that world.

He did everything he thought these ""systems"" had expected of him, he was loyal to it.  And it left him with nothing and I think at the end of the movie, he realizes that.  

Maybe not the real Sheeran, but this fictionalized version of him seemed to realize that this wasn't worth it and I couldn't help but watch the closing scene and wonder what was going through his mind.  His kids want no contact with him, his closest friend betrayed and dead by his own hands and the scene with the nurse who doesn't even know who Hoffa is, makes it all seem like none of it mattered.  His loyalty, like Hoffa, is destined to be forgotten by time.

At the end of the day, it's subjective and about taste in terms of enjoying it, but Scorsese has definitely not done a copy/paste of previous crime films.

Maybe the first scene when young de niro is driving the truck that breaks a few second later , that first shot doesn't look that great , his face seems weird.

But in my case the movie hit me , especially those last 15 min. Seeing de niro character weak and alone , the ending shot of the movie kinda scared me. I am 21 years old  pretty young. But my grandpa , he is very old 78 , and he had a rough life , a hard worker and had to live with his wife (who had mental problems) it wasn't a easy life for him , and it really let's you know just by looking at him , specially on new year partys , another year goes by and he looks sad , like he remembers being young and maybe wanted to change some life choices. It scares me , the thought of reaching the end of your life and being full of regrets , or being alone. And also thinking that this may be the last great movie of any of these three amazing actors ( Robert , Pesci and Al) always been a fan of those actors and scorsese , and rewatching old movies from those guys and seeing how young they were back then and how old they look now , man it's scary , losing friends and family in your life journey.

They should have cut some other scenes and show more of the strained relationship with frank and his fam. 

We didn’t really need all those scenes of them driving, pulling the car over and smoking. We also don’t really need the background on most of the minor characters. Russels wife, the whole laundry thing for instance. It’s already established that angel and Russell are high ranking mobsters. Angelo has no further role afterward. 

Crazy joe- the attempted assassination whom they never explained who it was on. Other than being another person that frank kills in the movie, adds nothing to the movie.

f8zekzm,I liked the movie but I agree the de-aging was not well done and it was distracting at times.  At no point did any of the older characters ever look like they were not elderly.  You can change the face but you can change the hold man hunched over walk they all had.  The fight you referenced was parasitically hard to take seriously with his soft old man attempts at kicks.,e2149d
f8yxft6,"Agreed. This was an old, boring, tired film. There was no world created we could inhabit with the characters, and the CGI was distracting. The action scenes, like Frank slowly, stiffly, kicking a butcher, were silly. And the film was way too long. Drawn out shots of Frank, for example, tracing his driving route to Ohio on a map with a Sharpee, or dealing with his daughter, didn't add value to the narrative. 

I developed a theory watching it - Scorsese, who doesn't like the entertainment industry moving toward streaming, hatched a plan to suck as much $ as he could from Netflix, and waste it on a large number of superfluous period scenes (""we'll need 14 classic Cadillacs, eight '50s Chevys..."").  

I'm a Scorsese fan who thinks Goodfellas was the most perfect movie ever made. I realize this was a ""different kind of movie"", it just wasn't a very good one.  Give Marty some unknown actors, a modest budget, and a good script, and let him make something fresh.",e2149d
f8z1yci,"Perhaps I'm overthinking it but I liked the beatdown scene because, like the shooting scenes it was not glamourized.

It wasn't some slick fight choreography, just a dude for whom violence comes naturally flailing about and inflicting violence on a person not accustomed to it. This to me, makes it more real and brutal.

The executions are similar, they're not filmed as glamorous badass scenes but as what they are. An unpleasant job that needs to be done quickly, no monologues, no fancy takes, just an unexpected blam blam and you're dead before you realize what's going on.",e2149d

f9oi39v,"if you rewatch the movie, you'll notice that it wasn't easy for Frank to reconcile himself with the decision to kill Jimmy (repeated attempts to warn Jimmy and stall Russ/Salerno, sleepless night before the deed) and everything in his body language with Russ and Jimmy at the final day tells us that he is extremely torn, but once Russ tells him that ""they did everything they could do for the man"" and realizes that Jimmy is a dead man regardless of his participation (not unlike the Germans he executed during the war), he went along, partly out of loyalty to Russ, partly to protect himself, his family and Russ (as suggested by Russ later on, they would have been on Salerno's hitlist if they didn't go along...), and possibly because this allowed him to ensure Jimmy would be killed in a ""humane"" way without any suffering and without even realizing what hit him.

What torn Frank apart, was not that he killed a real friend who 100% trusted him (""it was what it was""), but the call afterwards where he betrayed Jimmy's wife Jo, feigning ignorance and leaving her second-guessing what happened to her husband. It was also his demurring to place that same call (showing his cowardness and lack of compassion towards the family of the only  victim he was close with) that was the proverbial final nail in the coffin for Peggy to shut him out of her life.

At his final confession, he says to the priest ""what man makes a call like that..."" without elaborating what he meant with that, but the viewer knows.",e2149d
f9mbw07,"It maybe looked easy for brief 10 seconds but it wasn't, you could see that Frank really liked Jimmy.

But there is codex in mafia, if Frank didn't do it somebody else would and Frank would be gone with Jimmy the same day. 

Both Russell and Frank tried to convice Jimmy to back down, Frank was really worried trough whole time and tried to save Jimmy ass, but Jimmy was to stuborn to see that they were comming at him.  When Russell said ''don't call him'' you could see that in his eyes that he was helpless.  At the end when Jimmy gets in the car, Frank gives him long hug, i mean you could really see it, Frank didn't wanna do it. When they enter the house he hezitate a bit and i though he wouldn't do it but for brief second he looked like stone cold killer, he had to.


It's common in mafia world that the guy who enters in the room with you is the one who is gonna kill you.",e2149d
f9mffht,It is what it is,e2149d
f9mydm6,"because in the same way that Hoffa was dedicated to his union responsibilities and legacy, Frank was already dedicated to the mob. Look at the way he talks about how Russ took him out of poverty and gave him the good life, that's what the teamsters had done for their members and that is what their loyalty is built around and at the same time that's what Frank's loyalty was built around. Partially that's why Frank had all this deference towards Hoffa, Hoffa was speaking to something that Frank really felt and had this quality that Frank admired. 

>Also, does Peggy cut him off because she knows he did it?

yes, and that is just one of the many ways the guilt for what he did eats Frank up for the rest of the movie.",e2149d

OTOH, it was only years later that, on reflection, he realized how hollowed out the life had made him and how closed off it left him from his family.

It's why a lot of their show episodes have a large variation in runtimes.",e2149d
f92ip6n,"I'm a European that had no idea about who Hoffa is or about the mob's 'contribution' to fight Castro, but I feel like the movie is quite self-contained and good at explaining this events, and in the end it's all just back-drop to tell Frank's personal story.

f9maidq,"I give it credit as a masterful deconstruction of a gangster flick.  It drops all the bullshit and bravado that the old mob movies tried to convey and just turns these larger-than-life people into pathetic creatures.

I loved the way that every gangster who was introduced got an explanation onscreen of how they'd go on to die eventually.  It's so bloody pointless when you stand back and look at it.  These guys weren't likable anti-heroes and epic demigods.  They were meat sacks who went around popping each other in the brains for stupid shit.  They were greedy and all died.

Even all the death scenes, while gory, were really subdued.  Just in and out.  Couple quick shots to the head.  Dead.

Even Hoffa is just a petty prick who is too stupid and bull-headed to see the writing on the wall.  And, at the very end, the FBI agents telling Frank everyone he knows is dead and asking who he is protecting. That was perfect.  He's protecting nothing except some dumb ""code""—a code that had him murder his best friend and snivel like a sub-human weasel to his friend's wife.",e2149d

f8v9jjo,"Pretty much my exact sentiment. Had the chance to see it in theatres and I'm really glad I did. Scorsese remains one of the greatest and average for him is potentially lifetime achievement for many others. But I was watching him do all of his usual camera flourishes, and on one hand loving it because he's so good and that's why you watch his movies, but on the other thinking back to other movies where he does those same things and thinking ""well I liked it in that movie more."" 

As for the de-aging, I was never really distracted by it, but there were a couple moments where the actor was made to look young, but they are still a 70 year man so there body moves differently. You can de-age the face, but not the actor underneath.

Overall I'd have it behind Goodfellas, and Casino. I'd say it's a better movie than Gangs of New York, but I personally enjoy that movie so much that again I'd rewatch that probably before reaching for The Irishman.",e2149d

f9gpv6e,"The movie implied that the same people that brought Kennedy to presidency could just as easily take it away. One side of the mob wanted Kennedy because they knew he was the only way they could get back into Cuba peacefully. The other side knew that if JFK is going into power, he is going to elect his younger brother as attorney general which was a huge problem for them because Robert Kennedy's first mission was the hunt down the money trail from the teamsters union, and he wanted to unearth this blood money. RFK was successful in throwing Jimmy Hoffa in prison but wasn't able to take down any huge Racketeers. JFK died a year after he resolved the cuban crisis. The gunman Lee Harvey Oswald was an ex-marine associated with espionage and he had defected to Russia ( pretty sure he wasn't even allowed in the states when he was blamed for shooting Kennedy. ) then he comes back and kills him, and as he is switching from city hall to county jail Jack Ruby ran up to him when he was in police custody and shot him instantly killing him. 5 years after JFK died, RFK is told to take a short cut to a press conference by his security guard, through a crowded kitchen, in which apparently sirhan sirhan fired a 8 round revolver into RFK no more than 2 times at a wall of security guards blocking RFK. RFK takes 2 shots that remain in his body, 1 that hits him and exits the body,

FROM WIKIPEDIA ""Kennedy had been shot three times. One bullet was fired at a range of perhaps 1 inch (3 cm) and entered behind his right ear, dispersing fragments throughout his brain.[41] The other two entered at the rear of his right armpit; one exited from his chest and the other lodged in the back of his neck. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, he was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting.""

At times De Niro & Pacino were hysterical together-- my favorite scene was after Sheeran left the room when Hoffa was ranting at everyone and the conversation that convinced Sheeran to go back in.  But the last hour-- man I thought that dragged. I understand those who thought the acting was so good in the last part it didn't seem long to them, but it just seemed to drawn out for me.",e2149d
f90eg38,"YES. It was so tedious and not 'classic Scorsese' at all. Okay, it was a 50s mob movie starring De Niro / Pesci and somebody saying ""you gatta call Paulie"" etc, etc but it didn't have the pacing or drama at all. It was so laborious. You don't really get invested in the characters the way you do with his usual antiheroes like Henry Hill, Ace Rothstein or even Jordan Belfort. Just a lot of people doing dull mob shit.",e2149d

fa6qwik,"I do feel the movie was slow and nowhere near Scorsese's best work, but to call objectively 4 of the best actors of all time one dimensional is insane and really just indicates you havent seen most of their work. Pesci for example played a role here that was the complete opposite than what hes known for and honestly though I found DeNiro rather boring in this film, his role was different than even what hes done in other Scorsese mob films(reserved, quiet solider type rather than more boisterous boss type). Pacino since Scent of a Woman has rehashed the same character in a lot of his work but he was a bit different in this and matched the role he was playing quite well. 
That being said though, if you've never seen the other roles these actors have played(Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, King of Comedy, Godfather I and II, Dog Day Afternoon, Donnie Brasco, Heat, Scarface) you might want to give some of them a watch to see what you're missing.

And the de-aging wasn't entirely good enough to make you immediately recognize which era you were supposed to be in.  I found myself having to wonder if Frank was supposed to be 60 or 30 or whatever in many scenes.  Did he start his career with the mob stealing beef carcasses when he was in his 40s?

Raging Bull and Goodfellas were my top two before seeing this, although I think I need to rewatch Silence as well.  

At the very least, I believe it's on the same level as those in terms of quality.  I was also profoundly moved by the movie in a way that I haven't been by his previous films.  That ending was deeply haunting and beautiful, and it put the rest of the movie in a much different perspective.

f9ng7m4,"... Because they're paced more effectively in a way that keeps the viewer's attention? Not sure what you're getting at. It's easier to consume 3 hours of Endgame because it's broken up into clearly defined acts that are all paced well and feel unique from each other. It's easier to consume 7 hours of The Office, because you're getting individual story arcs in each episode. 

I don't mind long movies or even slow-paced movies, but there were definitely long stretches of time during the Irishman (mostly in the middle) where it really struggled to keep my attention, and that says something when it's a Scorsese movie. The only other time I've really felt one of his movie's run times was in The Wolf of Wall Street, which to this day I've only seen once from start to finish, because it's just too much movie and there's something about the blue collar crime of those characters that doesn't sit well for me even compared to objectively worse characters like those in Goodfellas. But at least for WoWS, the excessiveness was kind of the whole point. I've just never had a desire to rewatch it because it's too much to sit through again. 

I actually gave the Irishman a second watch just to try to pick up more things I felt like I might have missed the first time, but it was still a struggle to get through the middle section of the movie. It's not so much that it was paced too slow, it's that it doesn't always feel paced effectively for the content it's presenting. It feels like important information gets glossed over really quickly, whereas the most effective and memorable scenes are the ones that feel slow, take their time, and are deliberately paced, like Hoffa's meeting with Tony Pro or Frank's hit on Hoffa. I also think the movie's jumping around different timelines coupled with the flaws in the CGI de-aging also exacerbate things because there's never a clear sense for how old the characters are at any given time, and even when we're told what decade we're in, our brains process something being off because the digital facelifts just don't quite trick us well enough. Even when they're making De Niro or Pesci look like they're supposed to be in their 30s or 40s, they actually look like they're pushing their late 50s, and they carry themselves as such too. At least that's what it felt like to me. The only reason it became less of a problem over the course of the movie is because we stop seeing them as their young selves and start seeing them at an age where the digital makeup actually works.",e2149d

As this could never be confirmed, but the rumors suggest that JFK went to the mob for support in getting elected. The mob helped with the expectation that JFK would remove Castro, put a friendly government back into Cuba, and then they'd be able to retake control of their casinos in Cuba. Years before the communist takeover, the mob had put funding into Cuba to build a Vegas 2.0 there (this is a small plot point in the Godfather II). When Castro came to power, he claimed the casinos under government control. JFK instead went after the mob with Bobby Kennedy, and then failed to remove Castro.

Honestly, the thing that kind of annoys me is this feeling that if your movie is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long, you should consider just doing a miniseries.

unlike goodfellas, where the retrospective ""here's what i did back then"" was closer to a narrative device (been awhile since i've seen goodfellas, so maybe i'm not remembering that right), i didn't think frank as an old man was just a device to tell the real story of jimmy hoffa. frank's shitty ""masculine"" identity isolating him from everyone he ever cared about *was* the story, and it doesn't culminate until he's old and dying, figuratively digging his own grave, and still a prisoner to his own sins.",e2149d

I work in the industry VFX) and had I been involved my comment would be for the stuff where they're like 50 yes use the tech - where they're 30s -40s hire a fucking talented younger actor. Their movement (as you pointed out) just didn't sell it. a Character is more than just the face, and sadly I don't think anyone had the guts to tell the team behind this that it doesn't work. 

It looked bad, it was distracting, and it didn't work. they did not look the age they were meant to be mostly because of the body movement and posture looking old. Also things as simple as how they hold their hands just never sold it.

Part of what makes the film so affecting is that juxtaposed with Scorsese's other work in the genre (not to mention all of the more hollow copy cat films) the emptiness of Frank's lifestyle is really emphasized. It's not a raucous gangster film, but that's the point.",e2149d

fadggu5,"The blowing up thing was kinda a good ""stepping stone"" I feel. To me, it was really not the fact that ""oh it will prolly be the bosses laundromat"" but a setup to have him in the bosses pocket from then on. If they told the dude who asked him to do the bombing to ask it and keep it on the low, they can then act as if he should've come forward and turn it into a ""we'll look the other way for now this time"" and also earn some loyalty/fear.

I agree on the point about him walking out when Pacino was throwing motherfuckers around. I don't think any sane person would take offense considering Pachino was angry at the people who had done a poor job. If you're not part of the team, you don't take offense to that. I felt like it was more of an old schooler thing tbh. Like if you do that enough times in their general direction, they'll take offense simply on principle. Maybe that was the problem here. Something the old timers just didn't like in general having people wave towards them screaming motherfuckers and stuff.  

 As for them not feeling like friends, I do understand what you mean, but that can also be because we as an audience know them. We know they're old, we know this is their last bit together. It feels like establishing something from a ""younger age"" would seem a bit fake or shallow. Maybe that was partly why it felt like it did? Just my take on it. I really liked the movie overall.",e2149d

I watched Gangs of New York and the Departed back to back before watching the Irishman straight after and as much as I loved the Irishman, I'd have to say The Departed for me still reigns supreme as the best Scorsese movie of the past 20 years and one of the best 3 movies he's ever made (along with Taxi Driver and Casino for me). Though personally, I wouldn't mind seeing The Lighthouse or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood get best picture while Parasite wins best foreign language film, but The Irishman at the very least better be nominated. If the Academy, pulls some shit saying that The Irishman doesn't count, I'll be up in arms, but as long as the Irishman, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or The Lighthouse wins best picture I'll be a happy camper this year. I might add the Farewell to Oscar contention as well, but I haven't seen it yet, so I can't express my opinions on it.",e2149d

What about DB cooper?

f9iecj5,The fish in the car was significant imo. Sally Bugs was pissed because he didn't want to have to sit in front of Frank and vise versa.

f9jyi3h,"Also The whole Peggy subplot is woefully thin for 90% of the movie. Which is pretty crazy considering the run time. It essentially hangs on a couple short scenes where it's shown ""she liked Hoffa"" and ""her dad beat up a guy"" (the less said about THAT scene the better lol) then all the sudden at the end we are to supposed to feel how broken he is about his estranged daughter. (and i honestly could not even tell you his other daughters name lol).

They spent like an hour letting Pacino overact to show us how out of control Hoffa had become but only a few minutes on Frank's relationship with his daughter. Then puts that relationship to the forefront at the end.

f9onubg,"These are the most sensible reasons I've seen yet for someone not liking the movie. I watched it yesterday night at home in one go and I liked it very much. But I can understand that not everyone would like it. I'm a fan of the genre and of Scorsese. And particularly of Joe Pesci, who was great! I also tend to not enjoy (to put it mildly) all ensemble superhero movies, especially the Marvel kind.

The movie was indeed overlong, and I thought about breaking it in between at 1.40 (as generally suggested), but I kept watching. I didn't feel it was dragging, except in a couple of parts. My issue was that I just could not sit and watch a movie for that long.  I would probably have lost patience if I'd watched it in a theater.

My biggest issue with the movie was with the aging/de-aging part. I'd have preferred that they used younger actors for the earlier timelines. While the technology used is indeed mind blowing, you know in the back of your mind that it is just computer sorcery. The way the actors move give away their age, and that does keep nagging like a pebble in the shoe, preventing full suspension of disbelief (and immersion).

I'd definitely watch it again, but probably after a few months, and definitely not in one go.

I think I enjoyed 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' as much as 'The Irishman', but if I were to choose between the two just now, I'd choose 'Once Upon A Time...' without missing a beat.",e2149d
f9pffri,I agree with your view that the movie was disappointing. However the reasons you give are shallow (blue eyes looking horrible? WTF) and not enough to deem the movie bad/boring.

The specifics of the mob are a lot less important to Frank, as he isn’t reflecting on its structure, but rather his regretful actions while involved with them. If you want mob specifics, go watch Casino or Goodfellas, but that’s not what Irishman is about.
Where in the movie did it say that the mob HAS to be menacing. That’s not the focus of the movie- it’s humanizing these people that have real problems living very immoral lives. You aren’t supposed to root for these characters either. They exist as they are and meet the same fate everyone else does- and odds are when you’re 90 and alone, you’ll remember all those moments of grief very episodically too.

When I looked it up after, I wasn't surprised to learn it was in development hell for a decade. The casting would have made a lot more sense a decade ago and obviously, martin wanted the repeat actors he uses in this film. Overall this doesn't even come close to making my top 5 Scorsese films. Not bad... But I won't be rewatching this one for... 5 years or longer. I'm ok with a slow burn... Even a long slow burn...

On Kennedy, they had different ideas.  The mob backed Kennedy because his dad was an old gangster and bootlegger who promised them that his boy, JFK, would help get their stuff back from Cuba.  Castro had confiscated all foreign assets during his revolution.

Of course, the ""Bay of Pigs"" fiasco blew up and the mob never did get the payoff from supporting Kennedy.  They didn't own Kennedy.  Quite the opposite.  John and Robert hated the mob.

So I think that scene was plausible. I believe the film takes Sheeran at his word and that we are meant to take the friendships of Hoffa and Sheeran and Sheeran and Bufalino at face value.

They would have to use stunt doubles like with Pacino, which was quite obvious in scenes, such as when he attacked the gunman or got in any fight. Even-though they de-aged them visually, I just don't think you can de-age the physical acting ability. A 70/80 year old man is going to come across as a 70/80 year old man when it comes to physical acting, that's just the limitation I think, even if you use as much as CGI. Kudos to them for trying though, you just can't expect Casino/Goodfellas Deniro or Heat/Scarface Pacino, because man they're old and with age, even the best lose their ability to perform the way they used to. That being said Joe Pesci was the best amongst everyone, he was so dialled in to his character.

Similar with the runtime, it's not the pace of a Departed or Goodfellas, but it was a fascinating experiment to have the movie span decades of the titular character, and to see how things changed for him till his final days. It was sad and compelling to see that.",e2149d

Joe Pesci was OKAY? You are entitled to your opinion but just because the characters ""didn't raise their voices"" doesn't mean they weren't rich and complex.

f8xsho2,"Also I think you're very much supposed to be conscious of the actors' history in the genre. With Pacino being there as well you can draw a line from this back not just to Scorsese's earlier gangster films, but Pacino's right back to the first Godfather (which I'm fairly sure the final shot is referencing).

They could almost have called it The Last Gangster Movie.",e2149d
f9f6xxt,"It was interesting watching The Irishman through the lens of Scorsese's comments and looking for differences and similarities to the genre films he is so critical of.  It was hard for me, when watching through that lens, to not see the Irishman as a genre film in its own right.  We've seen all these characters before in other mobster movies. There are so many beats that are so similar to other movies of the genre.  It was a beautiful film, sure, but many Marvel movies are spectacularly beautiful.  To be honest, I was pretty shocked that, for a 3.5 hour film, none of the characters have any rich inner life whatsoever.  I've seen many comic book movies half the running time where the inner lives and the motivations have more depth.  

On the other hand, I did love how the historical elements were woven into the movie, and Scorsese does a great job, as always, with the details and with the actors, putting them in positions to shine. Even though we don't really get to know any of the characters well, they resonate as real people. The neighborhoods and the characters and the period feels genuine, even if we never get particularly deep into them.  The shallow snapshot we see feels very real. In a crazy way, it felt like a comic book in that it's beautifully drawn, but we don't get the inner richness and human psychology that we'd get from a good novel.  

In the end, the Frank character sums it all up for me.  We spent 3.5 hours getting to know this guy, but his seminal act, the betrayal of his friend, gets zero head space.  There's almost no wrestling with this decision. He's the narrator, so you have the chance to get in his head but you never do.  He doesn't even act any differently once he gets his orders.  There's no delaying, really. The only break is that he insists on sitting in the fishy spot in the back of the car?  A weird penance, punishing himself?  Not sure, but it was a nice touch, maybe, but you have to give us more than that.  I get it that maybe the lack of reflection is part of his character but if so, give us depth in others to make that emptiness stand out.  Instead we get an entire movie full of somewhat empty caricatures. It's an odd decision, to me, when you have 3.5 hours.",e2149d
f9fha0u,"Goodfellas part 1 was a master piece. This Goodfellas part 5 attempt was, if youre being honestly critical, not great work. The de-aging was not only distracting and poorly executed, but it was unnecessary. They could have had other actors play the flashbacks and it would have been better for it. Cinematography wise, theres nothing stand out in this film, its not groundbreaking, its not even as good as Goodfellas. The writing was spotty at best. Some of the dialogue was super cringy and overly expository on top of the overly expository voice over narration. The acting was mostly good thanks to a cast full over legends, but there were some pretty cringy parts too. The story was way way too long. Most importantly, it was a sausage party for no explicable reason. All the women in this film were passive flat objects hanging out in the background and thats just not reality. You dont think Hoffas wife had a few words with him about his career now and again? Where was that conflict or Sheerans wife? His silent daughter?

This shows a willingness to trust Frank and even a willingness to expose his personality/thoughts/safety to him. Basically, he was an ""open"" person who let Frank into his life completely.

At the end of the movie, Frank is alone with no family or friends in the world who care about him. I interpret the open door as a desire for intimacy, and also maybe as a nostalgic remembrance of his lost friend. Hoffa, as portrayed in the movie, is a much more genuine person than Russell (who only views Frank as a means to various ends) and maybe in that late moment Frank is yearning for his lost friend (and really his only true friend).",e2149d

A story this big - the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa - would be impossible to keep a secret for that long. During that era, people were flipping on each other like fish on a pier. At minimum, 11 people had to know about the Hoffa murder, and not a single one of them, including his own son and his best friend, never said a peep to anyone ever?

I dont buy it. I think that Sheeran was one of those guys who knew people who knew people who were mobsters, and wanted that arm's length association to be something more than it was. I think he ended up alone and forgotten in his old age, and wanted to be remembered by anyone for anything - even if that thing was something horrible. He didn't want to disappear just like Hoffa did.

He had a LOT of opportunities to come forward with complete immunity just to tell the truth. He didn't. He waited until there was no one left who could say, ""yeah that's bullshit"" to tell his tale.

The other daughter says that one reason their relationship is strained is because she could never come to him for anything. The really strained way Peggy interacted with the other men, specifically Russ. The way the monsters weirdly stared at the bride being given away at the end. The fact that Russ went to church alone to confess his sins and Frank was not there. And finally the realization that Frank couldn’t be honest with himself when he said they got him for Embezzlement when there were many more other crimes he was jailed for. 

It may be that it’s not actually sexual abuse being conveyed and rather a fear of the men because of their nature, but that last scene at the church and how the men stared really made me think this is what they were trying to convey.",e2149d

One of the beauties of this movie (and many mob movies for that matter) is that paradoxical approach.

Towards the end he says he always felt a bit sympathetic towards Chuckie, It’s possible he probably thought Sally Bugs intended on wacking Chuckie after he and Jimmy got out of the car to go into the house. He had served his purpose, Frank also mentioned something along the lines of three people can only keep a secret if two are dead.",e2149d

f92wtnj,"It felt like a goodbye from Scorsese to gangster movies. We'll never see a crime movie like Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed or The Irishman again. The last hour felt like Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese saying adios to the viewer. Great movie",e2149d
f8vg1cc,When have they ever not?,e2149d
f8vjnbe,"You say that as if it’s the first time any of Scorsese’s mob protagonists have had to face any sort of comeuppance. From my recollection, Henry lands himself into a rock and a hard place situation after getting nicked by the cops and Paulie finds out he was fucking around with drugs. Tommy gets whacked. Practically the entire Lufthansa crew gets whacked. Jimmy and Paulie go to the can after Henry testifies. That’s just Goodfellas alone. 
In Casino, damn near every Midwest boss gets sent to the can. Nicky and his brother Dominic get whacked out in the cornfield. A lot of Nicky’s guys get whacked. Phil Green, the mob’s squeaky clean front man for the casino gets sent to the can. Ginger fucking overdoses in some shitcan of a motel in bumfuck nowhere. Sam goes from being Vegas royalty to just another bookie for the mob. 
I think you may be coming to that conclusion based on the fact that in the aforementioned films, there was a romantic quality applied to the mafia and the life that it entailed, however that occupied only so much of the film, the glamours lives they led usually unraveled and fell apart in one way or another, the fall of Rome was always inevitable. In the Irishman, we see significantly less of the romantic qualities of the mafia, and we see things through a washed out, murky, grey lens throughout the entire film, so the entire film really serves as a bookend to not only the genre, but mafia stories in general. It’s poetic that Scorsese managed to say with the last third of the film, that no matter how virtuous you believe yourself to be in that life, you’ll always die alone, and life goes on with or without you.",e2149d

f9umsah,"In an interview, Scorsese explained that he pressed Chucky about the fish because he needed to know all of the details in case something went wrong, so that he wouldn’t look like he was lying. 

Something goes wrong, this gangster tries to explain the fish thing but then says he doesn’t know what type of fish, then maybe people don’t believe him, and he gets whacked. Scorsese wanted to emphasize how paranoid these men could be and how close they were to being killed at all times. 

So basically, the guy was just trying to cover his own ass, as he explains himself in the scene: “If someone asks me, I want to be able to tell them.” Or however he puts it. Also this is the dialogue as it happens in the book.",e2149d
f90tle8,I thought Chuck just had a dirty sex in the car that is why he could not remember any details about the fish lol,e2149d
f96zdqa,"It shows he was a man who dots his Is and crosses his Ts. But that didn't save him from the violent death that is usually the destiny for people in his line of work. He told people what was up when he had to go to the feds, which shows his usual due diligence established in the fish scene, but that person forgot to pass it on and the mob offed him anyway.",e2149d
fbtlvft,"That scene was put in the movie because after Hoffa disappeared, they found blood in his son's car. His son said the blood was from a fish.",e2149d
f992n9f,"Huh? I thought it was because the fish excuse got Frank sitting behind Sally.

Sally strangled a guy sitting behind him earlier in the film, it's a famous mob way to go. Senior absolutely insists he sits behind Sally, and the entire pretext is predicated on a super weird fish story.",e2149d
f9qestz,"I mean, he just aided in his father's assassination and didn't have a clue.  So, yeah, it was definitely to point out his lack of awareness and that he just does what he's told.

But I think it's a comment on Chucky, not Frank or Sally.  They'd notice details.  They still get the job done, but they know what's going on.  Chucky is oblivious.",e2149d

f8vdwj0,"Scorsese said in the DGA talk moderated by Spike Lee that it was also that guy trying to get the story straight, because if anything goes wrong (Hoffa leaves because they’re late, etc) he’s going to be the one getting the (potentially fatal) shit for it.",e2149d
f8v7p6r,"Watching this film made me realise that The Godfather was a hit movie in the time period this film took place. I'm not sure why that stood out to me. I know the Sopranos leans heavily on the idea of 90s gangsters loving the old films, but something about it all happening at the same time really stuck with me.",e2149d
f8w0btx,Ehhh. Not really. The fish serves other purposes. However the actual reference to Godfather is pretty blatant: when De Niro and Pesci dip bread for the first time a version of the Godfather theme plays in the background.,e2149d
f8x07y7,"No, that was definitely a reference to the classic Norm Macdonald film, *Dirty Work*.",e2149d
f8xhqv6,"I'm pretty sure it has to do with the disappearance the driver in reality had his car searched and claimed that the signs of blood was from fish he was carrying previously.

His father Sonny Franzese is also a lifelong mobster who’s still alive today at 102 years old. Anyway, in the interview this guy Michael says that Jimmy Hoffa’s killer is still alive today and in prison. He also mentions that he knows where Hoffa’s final resting place is and that it’s “wet”. I don’t know why but I’m inclined to believe him. He has nothing to gain by making that up as far as I can tell.",e2149d

She sees how much people love Jimmy and how much his work means to the Teamsters. She has always known the kind of dirty work that her dad does, and connects that more to Russell.

It's not clear if she knew how crooked Hoffa was, bit she trusts him and sees him as a good guy. Frank has two sides to her. The bad guy mafia hitman, and the good guy Teamster. Hoffa and Russ represent those sides and she abandons her father when he picks the mob in the end.",e2149d

f9nrnto,"There's really two movies here and it's related to what Frank says close to the beginning (relatively speaking): nobody today knows who Jimmy Hoffa was. We see both sides of it during the buildup of the gangsters and then when he's in the home. The gangster part is Scorsese saying ""THIS is what gangster life is like. It's not the glamour of hollywood. People die and they die a lot, in ugly ways which hurts everyone."" When we then get to the home, it's a look back at it from most of today's generation. People are either clinging onto the long dead past wishing they could have a second chance or have forgotten about it completely and are bound to make the same mistakes. 

Imo that's why his ww2 experience is important, because there's paralleles between being a veteran of that and a veteran of crime. You had to be there to know, and if you don't know then you'll keep making the same mistakes.",e2149d
f91wjq4,"for some reason during that scene I thought about that small moment when Frank first met Hoffa where Hoffa goes to sleep and he closes those double doors but leaves them open just a crack and the shot lingers there for just a moment.

I really liked the movie because he's not a hero, or a badass gangster, or anything like that which is usually portrait in movies, he's almost a nobody following orders because he happened to fall in that line of work, it's really risky to make the main character be someone that is so hard to empathize with, but this movie pulled it really well.",e2149d

I loved this movie.",e2149d
f8vg4bn,"> My only disagreement is that I do find the film wholly bleak. Obviously not all of us will die alone like Frank, but the ending has tinges of the same ending as Barry Lyndon: We're all destined for the grave, and that's a dark and lonely final destination.

Yeah, I think the interpretation of the ending is bound to be especially personal (and I feel it's intended to be fairly ambiguous, whereas the rest of the movie was fairly direct). If you want to try and put yourself in the shoes of authorial intent (which is interesting, although far from the only way to see it), I think it gets especially messy, because Scorsese and his actors *are* at the end of their careers, so you can't say anything about the future ""not yet being written"". And yet, no one could ever accuse Scorsese for living a thoughtless life... he's devoted his entire career to introspection and the deconstruction of these tropes. So I know how the ending made me feel as I left the theater, but I imagine it will play *very* differently depending on your own personal age and concerns.

The comparison to Barry Lyndon is very interesting... hadn't considered it! The parallels between the main characters absolutely fit–both are thoughtless, passive men, who rise and fall in an epic tragedy which tears apart their family. In particular, neither seem to feel meaningful agency over their life choices, and the resulting movie is this strange epic where the protagonist is like a passive observer to their own story. It's probably not a coincidence that Barry Lyndon is also one of my favorites.

I certainly see Barry Lyndon as unambiguously bleak, although I think that's because I see the endings as somewhat distinct. To me, the nail in the coffin which makes Barry Lyndon so completely hopeless is the fact that in the final duel, Barry's choice to shoot the ground is a moment of genuine agency. It's perhaps the only moment in the movie where he takes his fate fully in his own hands, and he doesn't just follow it blindly. And, of course, because this decision seems to lead to nothing but his own tragic end, you walk away feeling like ""fate"" is perhaps just out of our control, and Barry's agency was just naivety, and none of us really control our own destiny, we just live and then we die. And it's very grim. 

To me, I see The Irishman as a lot more ambiguous, because its climax is simply his worst moment of passivity (in killing Hoffa). Basically, Scorsese leaves open to the audience the idea that Frank could have made his own decisions, and lived a better life, whereas Kubrick reminds you that ""You might think you're no Barry, but would it really matter in the end?"". Of course, that's also just one narrow reading of Barry Lyndon (I've generally seen it as a movie about as a passive man who rises and falls according to the whims of fate, and none of his actions particularly matter), so your mileage may vary on BOTH fronts. I'd probably have to think about it more (I like the comparison of the protagonists), but for now at least that's why I see The Irishman as much more ambiguous (in its ending, it doesn't feel like a terribly ambiguous movie for the rest of it).",e2149d

f8x3kb3,"You aren’t being downvoted because “we aren’t allowed to say nice things about marvel movies”. You’re being downvoted because your example you’re providing doesn’t actually make the compelling argument you think it does. In fact, if anything, you’re unintentionally supporting Scorsese’s point. 

Infinity War wasn’t the end of a story. It was the end of one chapter in a story. As a result, it’s ending was stripped of much of its power because, in the end, we all knew that Infinity War’s conclusion would be undone in the very next movie. More importantly, we knew that the series was ultimately going to end on a more digestible and emotionally comfortable note. This was merely a final road block before our heroes would save the day like they always do. As a result, when we left the theater, the question most of us were asking wasn’t one of emotional weight—it was “how will Endgame undo what we just witnessed because there’s not a chance in hell that they aren’t going to bring back these characters.” There was nothing to grapple with.

Do you not see how there’s a huge difference between that and a story like The Irishman that is more than willing to forego comfort in order to connect its audience with something more complex and existentially troubling about the human experience?",e2149d

Frank always was apathetic to what he did but this time was different. It's like Russell's saying, ""Open your eyes frank. We've always been doing it this way. Just because he happens to be your friend doesn't make it any different. Every person you killed before were friends or family to someone. Now it just happens to be your friend. That's just how business goes wether its the past, present, or in the future. It's always been like this. You just never took the time to truly see it."" 

 Frank I dont think really realized this until it totally hit home with Hoffa. He didn't ever care to analyze the emotional details and there effects on others. What everyone, him included, in the family were actually doing, until it came time for him to be personally affected. In that life orders are orders. There to be followed with your life.",e2149d

Scorsese mentioned in one interview that there was instances where you were just reminded too easily that the actors were older than they should be, like Pacino rising up from his chair, apparently he didn’t have the heart to tell him he needed to act younger. 

Scorsese strikes me as the kind of guy that approaches filmmaking like he’s still a kid making something with all his friends. He probably finds it hard to intrude of the energy he has between his actors in some cases, you just don’t want to say something that’ll fill the actors head with doubt as stupid as that sounds.",e2149d

If you're a foot soldier in the mafia, you stand a good chance of being a position of having to deal with someone you like being whacked at some point in your career. Its part of the business. Think Goodfellas for example where DeNiro struggles with Pesci's character being whacked.  Just the nature of the mafia world you live in.   Their word is law. That is part of the deal you make when you decide to sign up. 

In the Mexican cartel, it is worse as they regularly ask their Sicarios to kill people they have worked with in other jobs. Long standing co-workers with whom you've done many jobs go down overnight and you have to move on just like that.  Check out 'El Sicario' by Charles Bowden which is a pretty good book on their life.   Seemed like life for the Sicario  in the cartel is way more heartless than in the Italian mafia version.

This is the same thing here, both De Niro and Al are often in the moviie but it's from De Niro perspective showing Al Pacino's/Hoffa  life, the problem with this movie is Frank Sheeran isn't really intresting charachter to follow, were in Casino Ace was pretty solid.",e2149d

f9k9lxa,Especially considering all the CGI tech used in this movie,e2149d
faxyl46,"Re watching it I think I noticed something... It seems like Russell (or anyone for that matter) almost never blatantly asks Frank to kill anyone, but will say something that implies someone needs to die and then looks at Frank and the next cut is to that person being whacked. This also happens with Harvey Keitel telling Frank that Whispers won't need his money anymore, but at no point ever tells Frank direct orders to kill Whispers. Also when Fat Tony keeps mentioning ""someone should calm Jimmy down"" or ""someone should tell him I said this"" and then looks at Frank. Or another example is how Russell never tells Frank direct orders to kill Sally Bugs later, or Crazy Joe either, but just gives him a look in the eyes both times. It might be part of the movie's style to tiptoe around telling Frank directly to kill someone so when Russell is telling Frank to get on the plane, those are the non-specific orders that it must be him to kill Jimmy.

Edit: I also read a theory that Frank insisted he sit in the back seat because he didn't want to risk being choked out himself by Sally Bugs once Jimmy was dead. That makes the most sense to me now.

Edit 2: I'm quite sure this is the style of the movie now because the set up is when Frank says ""In the war they never tell you directly to kill anyone but they want you to"" or something like that during the scene where he kills the two Germans.",e2149d
fftzn1n,You know that does make sense. Good guy Bronson.,e2149d
fg1btfy,"I think he was good too. However it was another example of an aesthetic choice made in this film that made it hard to be immersed in the movie. In this case let’s cast a younger man, make him fat and old. Again it simply looked ridiculous and was detracted from the film.

That and his character was largely unexplained.",e2149d
fg1d75i,"The criticism of the cgi and my criticism of the aesthetic choices in aging or de-aging cast members are entirely valid as these aspects of the film all inadvertently remove the viewer from immersive experience of the film. I found myself very disconnected to this film for that reason amongst others.

Sure, they are minor details. Again I agree but they are happening again and again and for some unfortunately pedantic viewers like myself it’s enough to never connect with the film.

Totally agree about the final hour, by far my favourite part of the film and to me the most unique aspect of this film. I wish they could’ve made it more impactful by showing their family lives in greater detail. 

No problem with the character of Peggy although....when we see her going out with her friend and it’s suddenly Anna Paquin who looks 40 again it’s just baffling why they chose to do this. Just cast actors that fit the time and place of the characters and perhaps this wouldn’t be such a disjointed movie.",e2149d

feo6oia,"Dude, people would've respected your opinion as well till 'you hit us over the head' with that last paragraph. Martin Scorcese's movies have given more to cinema than anything Marvel can or ever will give and this is coming from someone that saw Endgame 3 times in theatres. You need to recognise which is which - very good movies based on comic books for kids and movies made with a vision to depict the drama of human life in a particular setting. 

Coming to the movie itself, it is not fast paced or exciting like Goodfellas or Wolf of Wall Street. It is a more languid and unhurried movie, almost similar to Silence his previous movie before The Irishman. This is a bit similar to the backlash Once Upon A Time in Hollywood got because it strayed a lot from the typical Tarantino fare. Irishman's a fuckin' masterpiece and close to the best thing Scorcese's ever made in his career including Taxi Driver and Raging Bull",e2149d
feibtih,"Lol, ironically I was so close to watching The Godfather. But then I saw it was 3 hours long and was like ""uhh, yeah... not got time for this right now... or most of the time..."". Plus, I've already had 90% of the movie spoiled to me via cultural osmosis, so I feel like the only reason I'd be watching it is to be able to say I've watched it.

And yeah Scorsese's Marvel quips are pretty ignorant. I mean, there are so many more terrible breeds of film you could complain about (like, 99% of Hollywood cinema in fact). I can accept that the majority of the MCU movies are quite overrated and only so popular because they are Marvel, but in a way that is the genius of Marvel's approach to them. Indeed, The Irishman seems like it sort of succeeds for the same reasons... people are just more likely to indulge in and enjoy more of the same thing from the same old creator(s) they have already enjoyed that stuff from.",e2149d

Bobby (Booby) Kennedy was always after Hoffa and the mob, so when Russ is telling him that he’s failing to show appreciation, he’s really saying “look, we whacked a President for you, have some decency”.

f94su4y,"Apparently when the FBI interviewed Chuckie O'Brien as a suspect in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa he was questioned about having washed his car around the time of Hoffa's disappearance.  The explanation he provided was that he picked up a fish for a friend and got liquid from the fish in the car, which is why he had the car washed.  The FBI was actually able to verify that he had received and delivered a 40-pound salmon that day.  This is documented in the [Hoffex Memo](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/fish.png?w=782&h=298).

Given that Chuckie having a fish in his car seems to have actually occurred, I don't think the fish itself is representative of anything, but I think the way the scene plays out with Sheeran and Sally Bugs is probably meaningful in a different way than you've interpreted it.  It seemed to me that Sheeran didn't trust Bugs and that Bugs was skeptical of the situation as well.  I think Sheeran was concerned that Bugs wouldn't stick to the plan and might try to kill Hoffa while in the vehicle or that Bugs would attempt to kill Sheeran from behind as he had done to others.  It was also probably Sheeran's way of keeping his friend close, knowing he was about to end his life.  And surely Bugs was making sure it wasn't a setup for him either so was grilling Chuckie to see if his story held up.",e2149d

I feel story in these is presented better, the pacing is more approachable, new characters are slowly presented to the viewer and/or there's weight to it.

I don't know about the general population but I know plenty of people who greatly enjoy gangster/mafia movies, regardless of the location they take place in, and it happens that the most climatic are usually set in the US.

f9gkq9x,"I watch westworld too, that show's really good. I think it was the deaging that kept throwing me off I couldn't tell how old he was supposed to be in certain scenes. Like there was a scene in the kitchen where Peggy was watching Frank eat cereal, he looked about the same age as when they were in the bowling alley and I didn't know where in the timeline they were because I didn't realize it was Peggy at first. Just confusing at times for me. But the ending was definitely why they needed to have De Niro and Pesci and deage them in the beginning.

I just hope the fad of deaging older actors ends. It has never looked good to me.",e2149d

As I watched it it felt like every single performance was phoned in to an extent since they had all played these roles basically in the past. Add in that Philly was very clearly New York and looked horribly wrong and took many like me out of the movie and I’ve gotta call bad direction. I really don’t get the love for this movie at all, it does absolutely nothing new and, since it doesn’t do that, I at least look for it to at least be good as films that are its peers that are similar and it’s not that either.",e2149d

It cannot adjust an actors voice (although they can kind of adjust these things too) and it cannot mask a whole body convincingly imo. De Niro and Pesci still move and sound like old men throughout this entire movie and De Niro's eyes were really off for sure. Distracting as that is I did try and suspend my disbelief for it but that scene in particular could have been done differently for the same effect I think. If him beating up the clerk had been done inside the store with the daughter in the doorway, concealed from the audience it would have played better for me.",e2149d

Endgame is a corporate product with no greater vision or reflection on the world beyond very surface level ideas. As a whole, it was tonally a mess throughout. 
Color was dull and unorganized, soundtrack was generic, action scenes had no weight or importance other than their final punches, it couldn’t establish a tone, it’s over an hour of time travel fanservice and an advertisement for Disney Plus, the acting had zero nuance, the directors were surely not auteurs pursuing a vision, etc...Endgame is trash.",e2149d

f9lwqmd,"You make it sound like Goodfellas, godfather or Casino didn't explore the concept of grief, regret or vulnerability of old age.  They did that while making the story engaging, and created characters that were interesting and likeable.  Nowhere in the movie it said the mob HAD to be menacing, it's probably more of an expectation and the film should try to sculpt a believable world.  Having an old men pretending to be a 35 yr hit man brings me into the territory of the uncanny valley.

Themes cannot be the only thing holding up a movie.  It has to be backed up by good execution and this film doesn't entertain me the slightest.  Some of the actor interaction had good dynamics, however those are so few of them that drew me into the scene.  Tony Pro was especially mis-casted IMO because every time he came on I got detached instantly.",e2149d

f9f9yms,"I disagree with your last paragraph pretty strongly. Sheeran definitely struggles with the decision internally, it's clear by what is presented on screen in his body language and mannerisms even if it is never spoken. In films like this there doesn't have to be a deep character dive into the soul of a mobster hit man like Sheeran. We don't have to know if he's feeling a ton of regret or remorse. We may want him to, because we would have those reactions, but a mobster hitman isn't someone who is very relatable to the average human being. I would say that he certainly wrestled with the idea of his action, but at the end of the day a man like that isn't going to have much regret. 

I think your final sentences sum up one of the points of the movie. These people are pretty empty internally. Even towards the end of the movie, Sheeran is still loyal and doesn't rat anyone out to the FBI, even after literally everyone involved is dead. Jimmy Hoffa, Buffalino, Sheeran, Bruno etc these were not good people, and Scorsese didn't try to glorify them. The reactions of his daughters throughout the film represent most of the audience- Frank Sheeran, according to the movie, died a very lonely man. If you live that life, that's typically how you're going to go out.

edit: You made a comment comparing this to Marvel regarding character building. I would say that the character development in this movie is organic and natural. Lots of movies, and I'm not even referencing Marvel here, have cheap and unnatural character development to advance a plot quicker. The Irishman never once engages in that. We see Sheeran's rise from your average joe delivering meat as a truck driver to a man doing small jobs, to a man who has no problem becoming a hit man as a result of his time in the war, to a man who dies alone as a result of all those actions. I thought it was very emotional and powerful, personally, but to each their own.",e2149d
f9gwb0p,"There doesn’t have to be things in the film because you THINK there should be something in the film. Due to the time period of the movie, and considering the violent nature of Frank Sheeran, do you really think his wife would speak out against him? Do you think his daughter would act out after she witnesses him beating up the grocery owner and he runs around with mobsters? 

There was no need for the female characters to be further inserted into the movie than they already were. Peggy was literally the moral compass of the movie. I think you’re completely missing the point of the film if you think the women should have had large roles in the story. Giving them larger roles would have diluted the ultimate impact the film was going for.",e2149d

It is a long boring movie rehashing all the great roles these characters played in the past. It was really a script totally built to say ""hey remember how great they were in this other film i made a few decades ago?"" that's all it was. 

Hoffa is nothing more than Al Pacino doing Al Pacino. I felt like half the time he was just there to remind us about how he hates people being late.......

Apparently when the FBI interviewed Chuckie O'Brien as a suspect in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa he was questioned about having washed his car around the time of Hoffa's disappearance.  The explanation he provided was that he picked up a fish for a friend and got liquid from the fish in the car, which is why he had the car washed.  The FBI was actually able to verify that he had received and delivered a 40-pound salmon that day.  This is documented in the [Hoffex Memo](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/fish.png?w=782&h=298).",e2149d

It literally redefined what a superhero film could be, and how villains can be created. What's interesting is how both films produced an enormous amount of hype, both from fans and critics alike. The Irishman was a pretty stock treatment imo, and didn't move the needle for me. Then add Scorsese's mastery of the gangster genre, and it just came up short for me. Having said that, his technical acumen is as sharp as ever in this film, so it's quite a spectacle to watch. Cheers!",e2149d

IMHO it’s that realistic, naked sort of aggression, seething beneath the surface ready to burst, that really defined a lot of his best characters (and films in general, especially his gangster films).  Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino...  it’s a huge part of those films I reckon.  For me, when it’s an old codger made up to look younger shuffling about like he’s older than my father (and I’m no spring chicken myself), then it takes a bit of the edge off.

This is normal. When you were 10, how much was a year of your life? 1/10, or 10%.

When you were 20? 1/20, or 5%.

Now that you're 30? 1/30, or 3.33%.

3.33% of your life is trivial in the grand scheme of things. That's why you feel that way. 

On the bright side, you also know how to be more patient because you have this concept of time being ""not as long"". 

If it makes you feel any better, this contrast also won't get much ""worse"" - your concept of a year will pretty much stay the same moving forward, because the difference between 10% and 3.33% is _a lot_ more noticeable than the difference between 3.33% and 1.67% (1 year when you're 60.)",e2149d

I remember being a kid in school still and thinking a year was such a long time. Now a year feels like nothing. 5 years feels like a year used to. Its not a farfetched thought to me that one day ill be 80 thinking to myself, ""these 80 years have gone by way too fast"".

Yeah, time is relative. 1 year to a kid is a huge portion of their life. At 28, its smaller and at 80 its even smaller. Not to mention the fact that most of us are in some sort of routine as we get older, time will fly.",e2149d

f9kn3s4,"Well said, there’s a romanticism to their lives in his films, you could say because he saw them growing up he admired how ‘cool’ it all seemed essentially. Ofcourse by the end of Goodfellas and Casino, we do see the consequences.

But this film really gave you that sheen still, but then the truth bled through because of the perspective of the children, this film explored how you look to your children when you live this life, we didn’t need endless arguments between father/daughter scenes. It was in looks and glances, it’s written on their faces. 

The moral compass of the film is not Frank, although it’s from his perspective, his daughter is the compass throughout. Man the more you realise how conscious Frank was of how he looked to her, the more heartbreaking it is. 

Like the story he told of the two soldiers, like them, he was digging his own grave all along and still for some reason, expected things to be different. This really was an incredible film the more you analyse it. 

Scorsese can say whatever he wants about Marvel films after this lol",e2149d
f8waetp,"But it kept that same tone throughout, it was a conclusion to the lifestyle, the repercussions of that life in that you see where it gets you. Spoiled Henry Hill moaning about how his life sucks because he ratted everyone out.

Then he gets older, his family abandons him, the people really was protecting abandons him. He loses everything he loves and all he has left is memories and guilt that he cannot even begin to comprehend. 

I think said it before, but all he found was a tunnel at the end of the light.",e2149d

f93oupy,"Without Deniro, I would never have felt anything for him in the end. He played Sheeran with such a delicate nature, torn between loyalty and as you said, blind to his doings. 

He just did it without understanding what it would make him, to his children and to those around him. 

He could either betray one friend or betray another. Or do nothing and have his entire family’s life in jeopardy. 

Deniro deserves an award recognition for this. This was the performance I think a lot of us were hoping he’d be able to give but were unsure if he still had it in him. I didn’t think I could respect him anymore for his craft but what he did in this film was so subtle and quiet. 

I really connected to his portrayal of Sheeran because you could see what was important to him despite his hypocrisy. He just couldn’t see it.",e2149d
f940dg4,He understands the last part.,e2149d
f9q2fan,"I said in a couple other comments. It all goes back to the story he tells Russ, about the two soldiers, digging their graves, thinking they’d be absolved from their fate.

He could never understand, why they would keep digging. Notice he says that in past tense, you could argue in his old age he finally understands why, it delays the inevitable.

In Frank’s case he was digging his grave his entire life. Hoping that the deeper he went, the more he could escape the reality of things, losing his family, betraying his dearest friend.",e2149d
f9awzde,"You’re right on that, the way I put it was that he’d become permanently lost because of his actions. 

All he’d found was a tunnel at the end of the light.",e2149d
f8whjm1,"Yes, thats the relatable nature of it on the surface, but then you have the fact that these men live lives that surround them with trauma and pain. 

They live fast and when they make it to a ripe old age, they have to accept that they’ll die slow and and have to live with the memories of those they’ve betrayed and killed. Sheeran especially, Henry (in Goodfellas) had betrayed all of his friends and yet Sheeran clearly felt so much more remorse, both because of his character but also because old age brings a plethora of emotions your youth will not reveal to you.

I can see what the attraction was to this film for Deniro, an old man who’s lost everything he supposedly lived for, his friends, his family. In the film, Sheeran by the end had alienated the people who would have truly cared about him. 

Need to watch the film again to take it all in again, but this film definitely about the vitality of life for these guys in reality, using the lives of those in the setting to allow them a chance to explore how they feel, what they fear and what they cherish at this point in their lives. 

Deniro’s performance was so delicate when it came to his character’s relationships. That is a complete deconstruction of how his gangster films felt 30 odd years ago. 

If you felt there was no evolution to the themes or nature of the stories he told back then, hopefully you found something else in it.",e2149d

I think that was the point actually. He doesn't have much regret aside from a few things and his punishment is isolation and empty loneness. I don't think the character (or even the real Frank Sheeran for that matter) were particularly tormented. Maybe he's tormented about Peggy not talking to him but otherwise I don't think he has much regret about his criminal activities.",e2149d

Seeing Joe Pesci go from the guy stomping people like a mad man to barely being able to hold some bread is a gut punch, regardless of the kind of life his character has lived.

I think you have to watch the movie again. He's crying the whole time and he talks about the phone call later too, about how difficult it was to do and why.

I also think self-indulgent is an odd way to describe Frank who seems to almost have little to no desires or ambition of his own.",e2149d

Mere set continuity isn't even as much the problem as movement continuity. If someone is lifting his hand and during this movement you cut to a different shot where he has his hand in his pocket, that's a noticable flaw.

f8xij8e,"I don’t think so. You’re automatically assuming that reddit is what makes up the general populace who watches Marvel movies. We know about there being another movie because we keep up-to-date with movie news. I can guarantee that the end of Infinity War was a shock to most who watched it. That being said, even Endgame ended with the deaths of probably two of the most popular cinematic heroes Marvel has as well as the retirement of a beloved character as well with no indication of the return of any of them. Also, Endgame did end on something substantially human - hope even in the face of tragedy. And that works for the characters in Endgame because they, unlike Frank Sheeran, were good people and giving them a throroughly dour end would just be needlessly cynical. Kind of the same way if The Irishman ended with Frank living a life of happiness and familial bliss. 

And I thoroughly disagree with the notion that ‘there was nothing to grapple with’. Hell, most of the first 2 acts in Endgame are pretty much action free and feature plenty of incredibly low key but subtle story and character beats that actuall deal with grief and how each of these characters struggle with failure. I feel like just because it’s a Marvel movie, people around here don’t even bother looking into whatever nuance or storytelling these movies have to offer and the default mode is to just dismiss them.",e2149d

A movie would just show 1 scene of someone studying before there are in the exam and then 1 scene of getting the results.

Jessie Plimmons (the actor who played Chuckie) seems to play him a little empty-headed, almost slightly slack jaw in a way.  Chuckie was in his late 30s early 40s maybe at the time of the hit?  Whatever his age, who puts a fish in the back seat - put that shit in the trunk.  Wrap it.  Etc.Etc.  Not the sharpest tool in the shed.

Did you know that the gun actually fired in the courtroom?  Hoffa got hit with a pellet or two from the BBgun.  I didn't think that part was clear in the movie - even when Hoffa talks about it, I thought he was telling a different story about charging the gun thing.  Some details were really hard to pick out - BUT they were in there.  The 5-finger sign to take the 5th amendment that Hoffa gave during his trial blew my mind.  I didn't even pick up on that, but its there in the film and it happened in real life.  There are little gems like that.

Also, did you notice the subtle call-outs to the orchestral theme from the Godfather movies when Russel and Frank are breaking prosciutto bread for the first time towards the beginning of the movie when they just met again in the restaurant?  There are tons of detail gems like this throughout the movie.  My favorite flim of 2019 by far.",e2149d

Now the mob thinks if Jimmy gets back in he will be true to what he said while campaigning, that he will not bow to the mob or let them just take pension money. Jimmy and the main character told the mob that it was just talk to get elected but the mob couldn't be sure so they offed him to get him out of the way.",e2149d
f9jaily,"Russ himself didn't particularly want him killed. But the head bosses of the mob, such as Tony Salerno, wanted Hoffa gone because they felt he was going to mess up all the side deals and loans etc that they were all having with union and the union pension fund. Remember at Frank's dinner, Salerno (I think it was Salerno) told Russ that Hoffa was planning on demanding immediate payment of interest on the loans made with the union's pension money, or he would take ownership of the ventures that were paid for by the loans (the hotels, restaurants, casinos, etc). So the all the mob guys would would their businesses to Hoffa, which they obviously didn't want. Or, they would be forced to pay interest on their loans, which they hadn't been up to this point. He was messing up their system and good ol' boy network and they didn't want that. They wanted one of their own as president who would do as they wanted. Russ was part of this, and the hit order didn't come from him, but if Frank disobeyed, then Frank and probably Russ would be killed by the mob.",e2149d
fg2y874,"I never said the criticism is invalid, I said it is being blown out of proportion and the impact of the de-aging on the movie as a whole is not that much. The most crucial stage of the movie is the last 1 and a half hours and the scenes from then do not have much de-aging (since the characters are already old).

Anna Paquin actually looked fine... she looked like any person would between the age of 20 or 40 so her appearance was alright.

Lastly, I want to address the whole 'oh why use de-aging and not younger actors'. I will tell you why... Pesci had rejected the movie about 40 times and I'm guessing he agreed for two reasons which were that his character would not be played by a younger actor and the money. When Goodfellas was being made, Scorsese wanted a younger actor to play Pesci's character (when young) but Pesci said he wouldn't do the movie if they did. Similar story goes for Casino, so I am guessing the de-aging was a way to get Pesci to sign on the movie which is great because he was a big part of why the movie was so good.",e2149d

Some scenes at the presentation toward the end had DeNiro looking like he was in his 40s, and some of the earlier scenes in the time line made him look like he was in his 80s. 

There was no transition in the movie where you could tell when it was set by looking at the characters, because their appearance didn't match the time line. You would have to wait and watch for time line clues before you could settle on what point of the story was being told because that 85 year old man could have been 50 or 70.

DeNiro always has a bit of DeNiro to him, but again, he's nothing like anything he's done. He isn't like this in Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull etc. 

Pesci's performance was **by far** the most nuanced. This is **NOTHING** like anything he's done before. Think about him in Goodfellas/Casino. This performance was the absolute direct opposite of that.

f9phheu,"Thematically, it's straightforward. And looking at the broad strokes of the story, it's straightforward. It's just a story about loyalty and betrayal, and ultimately mortality and the ""futility of it all."" Frank meets Russell, gets involved with the mafia, he starts doing jobs for them, he meets Jimmy Hoffa and starts working for him, a bunch of stuff happens with Hoffa and also the mafia, now the mafia wants to kill Hoffa after he gives them no choice, Frank likes Hoffa but is loyal to Russell (and the mafia), Frank kills Hoffa, and he lives out the rest of his pathetic life with nothing to really show for all the murder and horrible things he's done, considering how he's estranged from his children. But there's a lot of history and information related to the crimes being committed, and different criminal figures being introduced and then killed off, that you can easily lose track of what is happening to whom and why. And the movie stops being engaging to me at that point. It could be that I simply watched it the first time without being in the right frame of mind for it. But at a certain point, the movie just starts to feel like it's really spinning its wheels. We get several scenes of Frank's daughter looking at Russell and feeling sketchy about him when one, maaaaybe two, is plenty to tell us that she doesn't trust him. We get this whole thing involving the introduction of Joe Gallo and Frank's subsequent murder of him, and I struggle to remember why that was relevant to the main story, apart from it being a real life event that took place in that time. Maybe something was lost on me as a viewer, but by that point in the movie, we've already seen Frank carry out several murders for the mafia, and we already understand the process as to who orders those murders, so to me, it doesn't feel like we're really being given anything new to inform us on the main story, except to just show us one more murder. Don't get me wrong, the scenes are all undeniably well-crafted and engaging in their own right. But when you've already spent two hours showing us that Frank is a remorseless killer and that the mafia has no trouble killing their own, one more flashy murder scene doesn't seem like it's bringing anything new to the table. And if it's just about the historical significance, then why dedicate so much screen time to it? For me, it just takes time away from the most interesting part of the movie, which is the dynamic between Frank, Russell, and Hoffa.

EDIT: By the way, perhaps I simply misunderstood, but the implication of your original comment was that if people have no problem with the pacing of Endgame or 7 hours of the office, then they shouldn't be criticizing the pacing in The Irishman. To which my point is, why shouldn't they criticize it if the pacing made it difficult for the movie to engage them during certain parts? Fast or slow pacing isn't meant to weed out viewers as if it were some kind of endurance test. You shouldn't really need to have an affinity for one or the other, because pacing is supposed to be in service of telling the story in the most effective way possible, and if it's done well, the viewer won't even be thinking about it. At least not in a negative way.",e2149d
f9men4m,"Lol so much personal hate and narrow minded bs as if to espouse your support of ""real cinema"". Endgame is by no means trash. It's a vfx and comic book movie masterpiece and 99% of people who watched it enjoyed it. Your raging corporate hate tear down make it seem like you forget that movies are meant to entertain.

Don't think I hate Scorsese either. I love Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Departed and Taxi Driver. But Irishman is a miss. An unnecessarily long movie. It had a good start but then the character development went all over the place. No narrative cohesiveness and underwhelming towards the end. 

A great movie is suppose to present the plot clearly and entertain along the way. Once you begin to deeply dissect it and make up film school theories after the movie ends, then you're just being pretentious.

f9lxtsk,"But not every film needs to move at the same pace. Scorsese has plenty of slow burners. The theme of aging and regret is harder to hit home on in Goodfellas/Casino BECAUSE of how sporadic it is (then again, those themes were never the main focus). Specifically with Casino, the biggest theme (according to Scorsese) is excess. The idea that there was no visible glass ceiling pushing forced the characters into this pseudo-invincible godhood to eventually fall from. It creates a very menacing mob. Likewise, the characters in Goodfellas are living very delusional lifestyles. 
The Irishman’s goal isn’t to show how menacing the mob is in the same way as his previous films.
As for the acting, there was actual nuance that hasn’t been seen from Deniro, Pesci, Romano, etc.. in ages.

Everything about the execution and editing was very intentional. I love the pacing. It’s much more contemplative than his other mob films.",e2149d

f9fc5ni,"Yeah, I need more than a few facial expressions in a 3.5 hour movie.  You've got the time and the narrative structure to give the audience internal access but Marty never does.  I get that is a choice by Marty to a great extent, but it's also a bit of a cop out.  That emotional inner life is art and it's difficult to pull off in a genuine and striking fashion.  That he never attempts it at all, even as a foil or contrast is a terrible choice, in my opinion.  That bowling alley scene should resonate in ways it simply did not, at least to me.  That's the director's chance to show a full life against the empty lives Frank and the others lead but it falls flat in my opinion.  Russell has to TELL Frank that Jimmy had a great family, but we never SAW it. We shouldn't need Russell to tell us that.  We should have seen Jimmy's vibrant family on the screen. Instead I find myself wondering if Marty just doesn't know how to represent a full, vibrant life anymore or just couldn't figure out how to do it in the context of this film.  

I disagree about the character development, too. I don't feel like anyone developed at all.  I'd have liked to have seen what made Frank become this empty husk devoid of moral compass, but he's already there in the first few minutes.  By the time we meet him, he's already committed war crimes. Did the war make him this way?  If so, we have to FEEL this.  We have to live this. We just get a scene of Frank dispassionately shooting two Germans. Maybe I'm missing something?  Can you give me a single character that actually developed over the course of the movie?

f9ysky4,"> not saying that makes it right but there should be more nuance to male problems rather than just calling it toxic masculinity.

Indeed. In fact, it would be great if we explored this nuance further in artistic works like movies, not just using it to end a discussion, kinda like... we're doing here?

I'm not sure what point you're making here. ""Toxic masculinity"" is a very simple, general term, referring to the ways that our cultural constructions of masculinity can ultimately be harmful. I'm saying that it's a theme that Scorsese consistently explores throughout his filmography. When you write, 

> not saying that makes it right but there should be more nuance to male problems rather than just calling it toxic masculinity.

I have no idea what in the world you're talking about?? Because no one here is just ending the discussion by calling it ""toxic masculinity"", and leaving it at that. It's the term being used to *name the topic we're exploring*, not end it. 

I assume you have a lot of extraneous baggage wrapped up in the term, but for most people who don't have that hitch, it's a very useful and intuitive phrase. And I'm not sure what else we'd replace it with. Masculinity is a prominent theme in Scorsese's work. However, if you look really closely, and read between the lines, you might start to see that he doesn't always portray it as a good thing. Turns out that when parallel instincts (which are prized as signs of masculinity) make Jake Lamotta both a great boxer but also an abusive husband, that's a statement about how our cultural constructions of masculinity can be harmful. Hence, ""toxic masculinity"". What else would we call it? Unless you don't think that Scorsese is making any statement about how masculinity can ""go wrong"" in his work, in which case... well we don't watch movies in the same way I guess.

People sometimes act as if ""toxic masculinity"" is a statement that ""all masculinity is toxic"". But to be blunt, that is nonsensical. If you believed that all masculinity is toxic, then why in the world would you *specify* the part of masculinity that you're talking about? (""The toxic parts""). It would be an incoherent construction. ""Toxic masculinity"" is explicitly a way of describing that there are positive and negative aspects of masculinity, otherwise, we wouldn't include the ""toxic"" descriptor.",e2149d

f8zjap3,"That’s true, but you could also be trying the scene in multiple ways.  So they try all these different ways/looks to shoot a scene.  Then they get back to the editing room and they combine them all.  It doesn’t mean they were shooting and between takes deniro just popped his collar.  They probably shot the scene entirely with a popped collar, entirely without (just an example I’m sure they did things like this in a larger scale) and then in the editing room they just cut it together to make the scene work best.  Again, I’m not saying you are wrong, it’s just the mans choice, but I don’t think it’s as simple as someone didn’t do their job in during shooting.  An actor and director will try a scene in many variations until they think it’s working and they have their coverage.  That’s just my assumption though, obviously neither of us know.  I just usually try not to be like “oh obviously they just fucked up”.   The guys a pro, so there’s probably reasonable explanations.

Scorsese said he looked like a 78 year old rising from the seat when he needed to look like a 40-something standing up. 

When he got the AD or something to pull Al aside and tell him, Al acknowledged that he’d try to achieve a younger look to the movement. When it came to the take and he sat up, Al looked at Scorsese and said something like “58!”

Which was a compromise lol

One thing I wasn’t sure of now that I was that Deniro scene is he says later that he has Bursitis in the film, so that could explain the stiffness in his arm. There’s instances like when he threatens the man with a gun hidden in a paper bag where he does well to look younger.",e2149d

> 
> 

The reason for that is that people *assume* that they can split the difference. As in: they can have the money, the sex, the glamour *without* being Belfort, aka going too far. 

The only way to avoid this problem is by making it clear that these things are inexorably tied together and thus it is self-defeating to even start. Then it goes from being about a tale of the specific hubris of one man and more about the entire enterprise being inherently destructive.

This is relatively easy in a Mob film: once you're in the life you're in. You can't just not be part of the Mob and have the benefits. Eventually the life will come calling for you even if you aren't hubristic. 

I'll use this film as an example: Sheeran does nothing wrong. He's not a snitch, he's not an attention seeker he doesn't do anything crazy like take too many drugs or pop a movie star. He does it all right. But ""right"" is itself destruction because you will be asked to do things for the cause that are intolerable. You win by not playing. 

The problem with films like WOWS is that *a lot of the problems are due not to Belfort's criminality and hedonism but his hubris*. Which is to say: he could have gotten away with a lot more if he had been willing to settle for like...80% of his shenanigans. There's *nothing* forcing Belfort -or the fantasy of the person in Belfort's shoes- to hit his wife, or even take coke in the first place or not take the FBI's deal. That element of *choice* makes it easy to fantasize about being Belfort.

This naturally leads to people thinking they can have *some* of the life.",e2149d

This is made abundantly clear when Frank tearfully speaks about the day he “lost his daughter”. This, along with his guilt about killing Hoffa, is what causes him to make an attempt to repent in the end, and what causes him to die alone. The film would absolutely not be the same without Peggy in it.

After a bidding war with STX, it was announced to be produced by Netflix in February 2017. So 5-7 years before that would've been 2010-2012, when none of the technology that made this movie somewhat possible was even at capacity. As well he would've been working on Wolf of Wallstreet from 2011 thru 2013, which the movie did very well and was highly acclaimed. So he could've easily got The Irishman made then after all that hype, but he didn't, he then went on to get an even riskier project made, Silence. I liked it, but it did very poorly. He announced it was his next project in 2014, and it was release until Nov 2016. So he spent 2 years working on it.

I think every character was developed within reason. It’s hard to develop characters who are terrible people since we can’t relate to them. Scorsese actually painted Hoffa in a positive light- he was much worse in real life than as he was portrayed in the film. 

I think you’re looking for things that don’t have to be there in a movie. The things you’re upset about were explained or shown, even if it wasn’t done so to your liking. Not every movie has to deliberately explain every single thing to us, and The Irishman certainly doesn’t do that, but the movie is detailed enough for the audience to be able to understand everything going on even if it’s not made obvious right away.",e2149d

The end part of his life is regret about the call he never made (to warn Hoffa) and the call he DID make (to Jo, lying to her and stringing her along).

The dialogue lingered irrationally. De Niro stuttered his way through half this movie where a lot of conversations barely get past the first point.  Apart from the narration of De Niro , the conversations surrounding his daughter, and a handful of times with Pesci. The dialogue just felt like bad improvisation.

I don’t think Sheeran could have lived with the idea of it being someone else. As much as I think he despised the fact that it had to be him, he knew why Russel chose him. Russel knew what this meant to him and I don’t think he enjoyed the thought of it. 

It’s one of those terrible things, in an abstract sense where no one person is to blame, Hoffa couldn’t let go of his pride, Russel couldn’t let go of his duty and Sheeran could not abandon his loyalties.

No one person was to blame and that is what makes the whole situation all the more painful, if Sheeran had declined it, it would have shown he had a weakness to people he wouldn’t want to demonstrate that to and it wouldn’t have stopped the act. If he did it, at least he knew it would be quick. One could leave it to the imagination if it had been someone with a real vendetta against him. 

Remember the story Frank tells Russel about the two soldiers he shot, who dug their own grave, they kept digging thinking he’d let them off for some reason. There’s a lot of symbolism to that I think. Hoffa was constantly told that he would be killed and he continued to dig his own grave thinking it would save him somehow. He had too much pride to run.

We all dig our own graves expecting it to somehow absolve us or exclude us from the inevitable.",e2149d
f943k3z,"The problem was it was his choice to work for those people, the place he’d put himself in was his own making and I don’t think he could see that. To him, they were his friends and like a shark, he swam forwards, not backwards, ever. 

She clearly wanted that revelation when they spoke and I think if he’d have admitted that he felt it would give them a good life, they would have been the least bit understanding. 

The way he stammered and stuttered to find the words to  express what he was sorry for demonstrated he truly did not grasp the severity of his loyalties. He couldn’t betray them even at that point.

f9r6pl1,"To me, the grave digging itself is a figurative. 

He dug his own grave assuming that the outcome would be different. He knew what he looked like Peggy, and he kept digging, and digging, his death wasn’t actual death. Those looks they’d exchange throughout the film said more than any conversation. 

Peggy was judging him with every glance, she knew her father worked for criminals, she watched her father beat a man simply for pushing her, she saw him handle guns, he was a scary man to her. Jimmy’s friendship was truly a means to mend that relationship, and he chose the loyalty of the men he feared. 

It was only once he’d been abandoned by his family that he’d begun to acknowledge his actions had pushed them away. You could tell in that conversation with his daughter that she seeked the revelations of him admitting to his actions. But as you said, he still just did not truly know what to be sorry for. 

He just kept on digging expecting things to change, ‘like the man with the gun would change his mind’. He just expected Peggy and all of his family to accept what he did and change their minds about him. 

He knew what he’d done and still couldn’t betray the loyalty of the people he feared.",e2149d

Like the guy was like a best friend, if I had to wack my best friend, the last thing I'd want would be to hear him trying to convince me not to do it, and he also did that with the others, it's realistic because that's how people do it irl (I saw some shootings in my neighborhood when I was younger and that's how they did it, just walk up, shoot and run away, not a single word), not only to save them the feelings but also because it's near impossible for the person to react and turn against you to save himself. It's kinda mean to say but the way he kills people is actually a blessing, they barely feel anything.   


I know movies and tv shows usually do it the unrealistic way because it tends to help the narrative, but I just love it when movies do the realistic approach. I think American History X has the same approach at the end, if they talked in that scene it would totally not have the same impact.

f96dm6o,"It's not ""my armchair psychological assessment,"" many people like that their one hour TV show comes on predictably every Tuesday at 9pm, it's one hour of their life that's dependable in a chaotic world.  Or that they can sit down and watch every episode of Stranger Things at their leisure; they have the control, with a known beginning and end. 

Watching a meandering film that doesn't necessarily adhere to the tight three act structure of most hour-long TV shows is a much different experience that requires people to be open to the unknown to an extent. Not open to the specific plot elements (as you keep referring to), but to the different narrative structure itself. ""Liking"" or not ""liking"" the movie is irrelevant in this discussion.",e2149d

Also, you claim that somehow knowing that these characters are going to come back and not knowing how is somehow a negative. What of the Empire Strikes Back or hell, most good second installments of any franchise out there? They end on a dour note. Doesn’t take away from the fact that the films themselves are great. Do you chastise ESB because Return of the Jedi ended on a happy note? How is that in any way fair?

Regardless, my comment only served to point out that the Marvel movies themselves have a lot of really great stuff in them that just gets overlooked by those who love to jump on the hate bandwagon automatically.

When other unions began starting up, potentially causing a stir, organized crime made sure the teamsters union was the one that had the most say. You can call it whatever you want, but there was dirty money being shifted through the organization.

Im legit surprised that you can give your two cents about a movie thoroughly, but at the same time very out of touch and lacking appreciation and knowledge of understanding how a movie like Endgame is created. 

How can you say that a movie that involves the top VFX studios in the world such as ILM and Framestore, involving the teamwork of thousands of artists and multiple technical directors - Has no soul and director's vision? You're out of your depth. Creating stuff like this require 10x more soul and vision to be able to pull off https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzT_SXG_bAI

moreover... frank had 2 choices, which essentially had him in a corner. ONE, turn into the red fox before he arrives at the house, warn jimmy about the hit, get him out of town and risk having him and even his family wacked by russel, tony pro and/or fat tony.

Frank is just a simple minded, two bit criminal who beats people in front of his daughter and then goes on to be a psychopathic killer. He’s a snake who’ll kill his friend because he sold any sense of humanity to the mob. 

I don’t think this movie is about “following orders” — it’s in every mob movie how much power a higher standing figure has over any underlings. 

Frank really showed no second thought and it was all pretty matter of fact that jimmy needed to be killed and he was the one to do it — I wouldn’t call it brave because he’s just a psychopath but he’s not a coward.

f91k8a2,"I agree with everything you said... but all those things applied when Taxi Driver was made. Mental health, social unrest, disillusion, these are not themes unique to 2019, as much as the younger generation believes it so, these themes a universal and timeless.  Joker didn’t “create” this narrative, it co-opted it. I think people are giving the film way to much credit for essentially retelling a hodge podge of two stories (Taxi Driver, King of Comedy) and slapping a intellectual property on it. 

Joker is a very good movie. It is not an original movie. In fact I’ll go as far to say Todd Philips in his imitation of Scorsese, at times, clearly misses the nuanced messages of his inspiration. Joker is closer to “falling down” than it is to the movies it tries to be.  

Falling Down I’d say does a better job at convening generational social rage than joker does.

A best it’s a good movie, with great acting, that imitates movies far it superior.

Of course women are capable of any of these actions (no one is saying otherwise), but the system which creates a character like Jake LaMotta is unmistakably and unambiguously *masculine*. If the movie portrays ""toxic humanity"", not ""toxic masculinity"", shouldn't it then be possible to tell the story with female protagonist? 

Many stories aren't inherently gendered!  Frodo Baggins, great character, could be feasibly written as a woman and I don't think you'd be throwing out the whole series. If you rewrote Rey from Star Wars as a man, sure plenty of superficial stuff would change, but the core character concept would stay true. But the reason I say a movie explores toxic masculinity is because that person's toxicity cannot be reasonably separated from their masculinity. This is true of many of Scorsese's films. You cannot understand Travis Bickle's toxicity without recognizing his masculinity, it's fundamental to the character. Same with Jake LaMotta, Henry Hill, or in this case, Frank Sheeran. Their motivations have inextricable ties to their masculinity, and if you don't recognize that, you aren't really grappling with the character. And unless you believe the same story could be plausibly told if they were a woman, I don't see how you can draw any other conclusion.",e2149d

>Boiler Room is an absolutely cliche story that doesn't understand why these men become who they are and why they keep winning. It doesn't even dare try to criticise the whole system that created these men.

It's not trying to.  It's just a slick, well made film about an interesting story that shows multiple sides of it, kind of a modern day Wall Street.  It's not the best movie ever but it has a lot more worth than Wolf of Wall Street IMO.  It was entertaining and informative.  Wolf is just... its a heavy depressing film but it lacks the emotional weight and meaning of a heavy depressing film like Leaving Las Vegas or Requiem for a Dream.  It's pointless.

So, in a franchise, only the uncertainty of death is what decides the quality? So we just disregard the character development, the storytelling completely because apparently we know they’re not going to kill off some of the protagonists ( which is considerably false considering they DID kill off some of the most popular characters and in ways that were truly unexpected. And yes, Iron Man’s and Black Widow’s deaths ARE permanent. If you’re going to bring up the Black Widow movie, it’s already been announced that it is a prequel). By that logic, we should then disregards most action movies out there considering most of them pose no real harm to the protagonist.

Mentioned Once Upon A Time In America, which is a film I enjoy in theory but it kind of pains me to actually sit down and watch. Remaining coherent and engaging is tough in these films that span decades with dozens of important characters.

f8wj38r,least I can string a sentence together,e2149d
f8y7qb1,I personally disagree. If youre genre is focused on violence then the whole film shouldnt feel like a stroll in the park,e2149d
f8y575q,Gangster films aren't supposed to have action??? What planet are you on?,e2149d
f9f2lki,So see my comment? Lol agreed.,e2149d
f9f2hqp,"You dont have to though. That is your opinion on it. And that is okay. There is no reason to shit on those movies though just because you like these type of movies as well. The marvels movies were able to connect 20 movies together in a way that was never done before. And if we want to say well they are easy and shitty movies just look at the DC movies or the Star Wars movies. Its not that easy. 

The Marvels movies are what they are supposed to be.

Here is my dumb example. I watched this video about a guy demonstrating how to drum properly. He played a Beatles song and he did what one would consider ""good"" drumming and played the shit out of the drums and it sounded horrible with the song. Then he played what the song needed which was obviously much less. That is what the marvel movies are. They did what they were suppose to do better than they had ever been done before or since. 

If that isnt cool to you that is fine. But to a lot of people it is. To a lot of people it is a different kind of art.",e2149d
f9f1h7l,"I have never heard such a hipster comment before in my life. Art is subjective. Fuck there is a whole episode of its always sunny about it. Fuck there is a whole episode of adam ruins everything about it. But hey /u/Billy_Quiz-boy thinks he has art figured out so everybody else must be wrong. 

HEY EVERYBODY /u/Billy_Quiz-boy IS THE SMARTEST MOST ARTISTIC PERSON OUT THERE. FORGET ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK AND JUST LISTEN TO HIM!!",e2149d
f90tjx0,">along with Taxi Driver

You're thinking this because Harvey Keitel was in Taxi Driver *and* The Irishman? Hmm...

You do realize Harvey Keitel *wasn't* in King of Comedy, correct?",e2149d
