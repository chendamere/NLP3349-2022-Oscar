Unlike the trailer, the dialogue in the movie actually works pretty well. Briskly paced with fantastic action sequences. Shades of Robocop-esqe dark humor and even a character who seems like someone you would find in a cyberpunk from dusk til dawn barfight. Roza Salazar’s preformance/motion capture is the big stand out to me. She absolutely crushed it in my opinion. Feels like it’s gonna end up being a cult hit. I sincerely hope we get a sequel, especially knowing where the story is headed. I’d love to see who they might cast for Figure Four.",aoc6mr

***

Somethings to keep in mind...

* Japanese stories are often paced for [four Acts](https://www.katekrake.com/forwriters/kishotenketsu-the-four-act-narrative-or-the-plot-without-conflict/) instead of three.  

* The movie is based on the first four volumes of the manga and they like the film are a prologue. The central conflict doesn't even start until Volume six. Before that the story was about Alita's daily life and was very much a small town hero tale.


***

Even if they had gone by the book.

This part of the story was always going to be ""YA"", because it was about a young adult growing up.


All the ""deep"", ""dark"","" rich"", ""existential"", cyberpunk themes and serious adult drama.

Didn't start coming in, until volume six.

Before that Alita in American terms would be a YA, albeit a dark and very violent one.

***



If Jim Cameron had started at six volume with Alita as an [Agent of Zalem](#spoiler) roving the wastelands carrying out her duties, until she gets on [Nova's trail](#spoiler).


It probably would have better received by the masses. 


But that hypothetical film would have needed flash basks and exposition-dumps to explain how and where Alita came from, and how she got into her current situation.


My only hope is that it does well enough internationally to warrant a sequel.  ",aoc6mr

egdoi4v,"Saw this during their fan event on Monday...thought it looked incredible in Dolby 3D. The action sequences were fantastic.  I liked how it jumped right into from the beginning. My favorite sequence is probably the fight with Grewishka where Alita stabs her arm into his eye and utters the one allowance of Fuck.  The motorball sequences were visually stunning and great but they seemed ultimately unnecessary, if only to set up the whole Winner goes to Zalem plot.  I do hope it does well, I'm interested in the seeds they've planted for future films. ",aoc6mr

egeuuoj,"Watched this earlier today after finishing up my uni classes and braving ""Snowmageddon"" (those of you who live in Seattle know what I'm talking about)

Pleasant surprise. I'm a fan of both the manga and anime (inb4 FUCKING WEEB) that *Battle Angel* is based on and have to say that it was a pretty good adaptation. Especially Roza Salazar, she crushed it - Yukito Kishiro is definitely proud.

The visuals and editing are amazing - I can't believe that all of these anime-faithful fight scenes were made in this, and even if I'm not a big cyberpunk fan appreciated the action. I just wished it kept a little more of the dark humor of the original.

egdald2,"went with my son last saturday. we both enjoyed the movie, but felt something was really off to say it was really good. here're some of our notes:

* too much material/story crammed in so there's a lot of questions left at the end of the movie
* Hugo was as miscast
* Alita herself was good

i think maybe they could've just gone with the motorball story for the first movie. go in-depth more into the game, with a big bad arena climax fight. but then, i haven't really read the manga so there may not be much story to tell in that department.",aoc6mr

An after credit scene where the cowboy cyborg with the dogs walks into Doc's cybershop to find Alita sitting at the kitchen.  She asks what brings you by and he says and old friend wanted to say hello.

In walks a certain little doggie with a robot body.  Alita picks him up and hugs him.

egfm98a,"This is really how live-action adaptations of anime and manga should be done. GUNNM/Battle Angel: Alita was one of the first animes I'd ever watched back in the days of Sci-Fi Channel's Saturday Anime, and it was one of the first manga I'd read. 

Story-wise, it is pretty damn faithful, and everyone's performance was good, Rosa Salazar and Christoph Waltz easily being top tier. The CGI was top tier, as well, and A LOT of the scenes were faithfully reproduced and just fucking amazing to behold.

Speaking of CGI, Salazar's enhanced eyes didn't detract a single bit from the experience - in fact, it only managed to enhance it. She was incredibly emotive, especially when capturing Alita's initial sense or child-like wonder at the world around her.

I don't know if a non-anime fan will like this. I certainly hope they do, because this 100% deserves the sequels to finish the story Alita.",aoc6mr
egdcwny,"Appropriately enough for a film about a human brain transported into a super-sophisticated robot body it can barely make sense of, Alita: Battle Angel is just an incredibly 90s script wired into a totally cutting-edge production, something only really $200 million in 2018 could've delivered.

I really mean this: the production design here - everything about how it looks and feels - is totally bonkers, absolutely breath-taking. There's a lot here that is strange or frustrating. I also adored every second of it.

This is a fascinating and deeply uncool-ass movie. I love how wedded it is to a very 'hot-in-the-mid90s' idea of what 'cool' even is. There's a lot of, like, street hoodlums playing roller skate sports (wearing sleeveless tops and bandanas) that put me in mind of the Rufio-led Lost Boys in HOOK. Who obviously to this day define what cool means to anyone who was under the age of 10 in 1992.

The love interest, Hugo, is the weakest member of the core cast - it is not even close - but he has such a bland 90s boyfriend vibe you can't even complain that much. It just fits the mood (and is exactly the sort of guy you could see a teenage girl going for). If you're gonna be a bit shit you may as well be shit in a funny and novel way. So it ticks the boxes for me. But the supporting villains - Ed Skrein and Jackie Earle Haley - absolutely kill it. And they're great mo-cap designs in their own right. The quality of the CG does vary overall though. The world always looks amazing, Alita herself is astonishing in places (and brilliantly performed) but a few points here and there looks creaky (especially, I gotta say, at the end). There's also one fight - which caps off an absolutely astonishing sequence - where the CG character models just don't look finished.

One moment that stood out to me was the source of the blood she uses as war paint. The marketing really hooked itself onto that moment (just look at the poster), which is interesting cos that's probably gonna be the least liked and least fondly-remembered moment in the whole film. Rosa Salazar - phenomenal throughout - sells the beat. But still. People ain't gunna (produced 'gunnm-a') like it. There's a pay off to it, but it's also the sort of moment I think few directors not named Rodriguez (or Cameron) would've gone in on.

It probably explains in a nutshell why this thing's gonna flop badly. It helps sell Alita's characterisation, it's an interesting thing to hook into a coming-of-age story I suppose. But it is not crowd-pleasing. In a film firing on fewer cylinders than this I think it would've felt cheap. It's a testament to how well the film works that I was just like 'i will go with you on this'.

Rodriguez can be hit and miss - a bit like Soderbergh you sometimes get the sense that the actual film aint so much the point, and often that whatever we're seeing is really just the by-product of some technical idea he wanted to explore behind-the-camera.

But that's not at all the case with this, it feels really deliberate. There's a lot of touches - random little beats scattered thru - that most directors wouldnt've have bothered with, that elevate the whole exercise. The shots of his hands as we're shown the care with which Ido goes about his work, Hugo momentarily stepping off the edge of the old church, the top-down coverage shot of the alleyway ambush scene. Alita whispering to herself right before she applies the war-paint. The amount of care Rodriguez takes here on the directorial side is really going unsung I think. The cumulative effect of all that is what makes the world really click and feel alive to me.

And overall this is the gnarliest 12a/PG-13 rated fucken thing I've ever seen as well. Robert basically seems to have realised you can totally short-out the ratings board criteria if you don't have blood. These guys are robots. Weirdly gooey, very fleshy, but still robots. I think these are the most visceral, viscera-having cyborgs/droids I've seen in a film outside of Tetsuo or Alien. The former was \*definitely\* a huge influence. Everyone gets cut up and sliced to fuck.

Some of the carnage here is genuinely pretty unsettling to look at, the face-slicing especially isn't far off a Miike flick. I think RR has put out stuff rated 18 over here that ain't even close to being as weird and gross as the shit in this. I loved it. The, like, honesty and openness of the emotional register JC and RR are going for just meshes really in a really interesting way with how gross and splanchnic it all is. There's a truth to that I guess.

What I'm trying to say is that this is an interesting one. My main takeaway is that - a) it is far weirder than the trailers made it look (and they made it look weird enough as it was), and b) the messy structure kind of works both for and against it, in a way. The ending is so absurdly unsatisfying on the face of it - but emblematic of the movie enough to not ruin it. It put character work above spectacle, which is admirable in its way. I've noticed more and more than critics complain about 'third act bloat' and the need to cap things off with a huge battle. But when films (this, Glass) come at it from a different angle they get roundly shat on. I guess I don't mind the structure so much really the more I sit with it, the way it ends feels like a hat-tip to the serialised nature of the source material I suppose.

This is too specific of a response to anyone but the thing it reminded me of most is sitting in the school library, skimming through the graphic novel section. They'd never have a complete line-up of anything, so you'd just be reading random volumes, usually ending on a cliff-hanger, and you'd just have to take it for what it was. Amazing art-work, frequently compelling character-work, no hope of a satisfying resolution ever cos there's a billion volumes out there and my library had 3 of them and every other edition costs like £30 quid on eBay. So you were barely ever getting anything sequential. As reading experiences go they were satisfyingly unsatisfying, if you catch my drift.

And that's really what this felt like to me. It has one of those ludicrous sequel-bait endings, almost to a demented degree. And we all know full well that a sequel to this is \*never\* happening. But it helps to capture the feel of the property it's adapting even as it frustrates the hope that they were gonna tell a satisfying or complete story. But the emotional journey this one takes you on to get to that dumbass finishing note is, like, pretty brilliant. Fleshed out and and far more rounded (if hokey) than, say, GitS was.

So anyway, this is Tetsuo for kids. Weird kids. If your kids aren't weird going into this they will be by the time you're on your way out, because this film is as fucked up as anything with a theme song by Dua Lipa could be. You just sort of go with it, but it's the type of film where if you freeze-framed and actually sat and thought about what you're seeing [ie, some guy finding a brain and putting it in the disused robot-body of his dead teenage daughter, then finding out that she was post-pubscent all along, plus all the scenes where she's sat talking to her surrogate dad or bf with her chest open and her heart hanging out](#spoiler) it's always way, way weirder than you'd think. It's a testament to RR and JC's skill that it comes off as less jarring than it would be in any other story. It's the type of story you can only put on screen in a cyberpunk narrative, it ain't just a standard detective story with sci-fi costumes (*cough* mute).

I'd also recommend catching this in 3D - it was obviously made for the format and the sheen 3D projection gives to everything is good for mo-cap heavy movies. I think the CG and live-action components always blend better than when shown in 2D, I suppose cos everything looks faker. Different strokes and all that.

Of course it had some flaws, like anything, but not gonna talk about those. Visually amazing, had a strong cool factor to it, and the protagonist was engaging and I cared about her journey. On an even more opinionated note, this movie wrote the ""mary sue"" trope correctly. I know that term is overused for ""overpowered"" male and female characters, but I love it when we have a badass hero that we can also care about. Alita was kickass and she wasn't the typical ""strong independent woman just a man in a girl's body"" kind of character. She was very much female and basked in femininity and was a strong character with motivation and a clear direction she wanted to take.  


Story was solid, visuals were stunning and the characters were engaging. Plenty of emotion thrown in with the badassery and it subverted expectations here and there which was genuinely surprising. If anything I wanted this to be longer. I hope we end up getting more films. If not, this has cult classic potential in my book. ",aoc6mr
egj8kph,"As some who devoured the manga as a kid and is currently working in film, I have a lot of thoughts. 

- Holy shit, this might be the most faithful manga/anime ever made. Seriously thought they captured the vibe of Alita to a tee. Very impressed by that. 

- That script could have used at least 5 more drafts. Oof...

- Ito's partner was a straight. up. PROP! Seriously...I got that sense that her only purpose was to keep Ito from coming off as a lonely perv trying to make a sex doll. 

- Nova’s eyes are implants, not fucking glasses! And yeah, he totally looks like James Cameron with them on, so maybe that’s why they changed it? They likely didn’t want to waste Norton’s star power too. [edit: I remembered this wrong! link in comments below proving me wrong 😅]

- Those actions scenes tho...super impressed and want to see them again and again. 

- The way Iron City was changed to be the most middle class and pleasant city was probably the most disappointing and confusing alteration. As people have mentioned in here, that completely fucks up the motivation for Hugo and others to get off the surface. Perhaps this was changed to avoid comparisons to Elysium? Don’t think it was worth that imo. Also, I find it hard to believe everyone is still shopping at H&M 500 years in the future...whoever did wardrobe for extras could seriously use some imagination. 

- Thought that ending was pretty bold considering this could have bombed. Happy to see this get made!

- Overall, considering the lack of quality in the parts that usually define movie quality (script, acting, etc), I somehow have the urge to experience repeat viewings. I guess despite the glaring issues mentioned above I felt it ultimately captured the feeling that originally drew me into the world of the manga, so for that, rats off to Cameron and Rodriguez! 🐀 👏",aoc6mr

Action was really fun. Cool world-building. Alita was a likable well done character. Good effects. The love story was well told and mostly impactful. 

The writing was a little uneven at times, but not consistently awful. It was fine for the most part. I'm not sure if the IMax added much. 

My two major complaints are:

1. Hugo (Keean Johnson) was AWFUL in this movie. His acting was really really horrible. 
2. The movie felt very rushed. Didn't really stop enough to take a breath and flesh out some of the relationships. Seems like it bit off A LOT of source material. Maybe too much?

I think there are different types of movies and looking at all movies with the same critical eye is a disservice. There are cerebral, or thinking, movies. Emotional movies designed to move us in an emotional way. There are movies for which you just use a suspension of disbelief to just enjoy them. Critics rarely do this but in my opinion the only true way to ""review"" a movie is to look at the director and writer's goal and at the end see if it was achieved. If it was an emotional movie and the acting is bad, and the dialogue was bad, the sets and costume and props were bad, but you still end up feeling the emotion the movie was trying to put forward then it was a good movie. In fact with everything so bad and it still managing to do what it sets out to do, that is a real accomplishment. Some of my favorite recent films were made on an extremely small budget, they can't hire great writers or actors, etc. but the director's vision came through despite all the limitations they were forced to work within and that is a good movie. Just my 2 cents.",aoc6mr
egk09dd,"Really enjoyed the film for what it was, but felt sad that it wasn't everything it could've been. Alita was perfect though--Rosa did an amazing job and the first 10-15 minutes of her discovering herself and the larger world are fantastic. 

The world is incredibly authentic and actually feels 'lived-in'. I would be interested to know how many props/sets were built and how many were CGI because I thought this movie did a good job of having CGI, but also making it look natural, if that makes sense. 

The action is also top-notch. Seriously, some of the most satisfying action I've seen in a PG-13 movie. Motorball was exhilarating and exciting, and all of the battles were spectacular. 

Sadly, the characters and story are where this movie suffers. Sometimes it felt the movie built to moments that weren't earned. Like when Alita called Ido father. This should have been a really powerful moment, but it just felt undercooked to me. Really could've done with a few more quiet moments with the two of them I think.

Same deal with Hugo. Nothing against the actor, but I just didn't feel the chemistry between he and Alita. Part of that, again, was lack of small, character driven moments. Things rushed too quickly to romance. 

All in all, a great movie to watch and look at, but the story and characters leave a bit to be desired.

I also like seeing a strong female character as the lead who just exists without us having to be constantly reminded that she is “female”. She speaks for herself without everyone around and in the film reminding us. 

The film deserves way more hype than it is getting. 

I highly recommend seeing this in IMAX 3-D. Again, the action is ridiculous and deserves the bigger screen! I would put it on par with Infinity War’s action scenes, but not on the same scale as far as scope. The way Alita moved reminded me of panels from Spider-Man comic books. The slow-motion dodging was very well choreographed and didn’t feel forced. I think the thing most directors miss in these sequences is the actual acting. Often you can see Alita going through emotion and decision making as she attacks. Brilliant.

Looking forward to the 4K release! ",aoc6mr

It's totally an anime film for better or worse, so watching it I just knew this film was gonna not connect with American audiences.

Remember the first Pacific Rim movie? On paper, it may not have been a great movie, but I sure *looked* spectacular, so it worked.

I compare this movie to Lucy, both had great potencial yet both lost it by offering us unnecessary fight scenes and avoidable villains.

This scene was so badass but I felt like it should’ve been saved for the end fight. Would’ve been cool if she had gotten wrecked in the upgraded body for being over confident, having to revert back to Ido’s daughter’s body, maybe with some upgrades, or a combo of both for the final battle. 

All of the bullshit involving Hugo would’ve been better spent world building Iron City with Alita interacting/helping with the community, demystifying Zalem, and learning more about the world and her past. Or hell just more motor ball. I probably wouldn’t have minded Hugo had the chemistry and writing been better.

I can’t stress enough how much I enjoyed most of the action scenes. Easy to see what was going on with great choreography. I just wish the script was as great as the effects. I still liked the movie for what it was. Also, you can’t go wrong with Christopher Waltz flailing around a fucking rocket hammer.",aoc6mr

I first went to see Captain Marvel, and found the movie pretty good.

I  had already read Gunnm, so I was already anticipating loving this  movie, but I was afraid to be disappointed, especially by the CGI.

Boy, was I wrong!

  
That is simply the best manga adaptation I have ever seen!

And Rosa Salazar was simply amazing!!

  
I'm not the kind of guy to be emotional in a movie usually, but she got me good!

I even enjoyed that love story that so many people seem to have disliked!

Alita was definitely the star of the show. It shows you what artists can do with the human form the enhance it. Every emotion, every movement was so heightened and emotive with her in a really good way. She was just enjoyable to look at. How she moved, especially in the action scenes and her expressions of anger were a real treat.

Yet there is something wonderful about a film that decides what it is from the first minute and sticks to it. A wild 2 hours which i can't wait re-watch with my friends. I am down for more of Alita.

egmnsvc,"As someone that read the manga and was waiting for this 15 years, I've gotta say that the wait was worth it. I have some pet peeves, the biggest of which was that they stripped the moral ambiguity of each character almost completely. In the source material, Ido is way creepier, Huge doesn't have a bullshit change of heart because ""love"", Nova is more of a force of nature than the incarnation of everything evil and the two other main villains - Zapan and the big guy, have much more detailed backstories and motivation for their obsession with killing Alita, to the point where the latter even becomes someone to sympathize with. Also some of the scenes just didn't make any sense. But these are really minor gripes, I actually loved the fact that they almost completely rewrite the original plot and only keep the main beats. If I was the screenwriter, I would've finished it with Hugo's death too, since that was the moment in the manga that was the strongest emotionally, but I don't think they executed that so good. Or maybe the build up was bad, because Hugo was the only character that didn't translate well from the manga (contrary to what others think, I'm not blaming the actor, he really didn't have much to work with). And I mean it, even the seriously changed Ido still manages to recapture the image of the worried parent that is basically the smartest guy around haunted by his past. Vector and Zapan especially looked like they were reincarnated from the alternative universe of the Manga. But the absolute best thing about the movie was Salazar. I hated the eyes and I still think the movie would've been better without them, but while watching it I totally forgot about any of that. Rosa managed to bring to the big screen Alita EXACTLY the way I imagine her - this joyous innocent little girl that becomes an angle of death at a drop of a hat. She completely sold both sides of the character with her great mo-cap and the voice acting. I have a new favorite actress just based on this. Oh please please have a sequel. 

Last, but not least, these were easily some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. I'm usually really hard to impress with action. In the last 5 years, I've only really liked some of the Disney's Marvel fight scenes and the first John Wick (not the second, the second was trash). I honestly thought that the height of a melee fight choreography was achieved with the second Matrix movie but I may have to reconsider. It was insane. Especially the motorball was absolutely perfect, the speed, the momentum, the weight of each move was so real and yet so fantastic. My favorite thing is to watch a fight where the participants have supernatural abilities but still obey the laws of physics or at least some sort of laws. We get that mix so rare and when we do, it's fucking glorious. Despite my many problems with the script, this movie brought to life my favorite manga character and completely blew out of the water any expectation I had for how good the action will be, so I have to give it two different scores. The objective one would be like 8/10. The personal score is 10/10. Please please please make enough money for a sequel, oh god, please make it happen. ",aoc6mr
egsj72i,"I go to the movies at least 4 times a month so by now I was absolutely sick of seeing the trailers for this movie and thought it was going to be utter shit. Boy, was I wrong. 

The movie does a lot of things wrong (*cough* HUGO *cough*) but I can honestly say I was entertained start to finish. 

Loved all of the Motorball sequences, loved Alita’s changing wardrobe, loved “fuck your mercy”, didn’t love the dog dying, but did love Alita using the blood as warpaint, loved how much the movie pushed its PG-13 rating, lots of stuff to love here. 

Only crimes it really commits is Hugo and I felt like they couldn’t quite tell where to end the movie so they stacked three endings on top of each other. Really bummed that this movie is underperforming and a sequel is unlikely because I’m so ready for some Ed Norton Nova action. ",aoc6mr

egxfac4,"I see a lot of comments online on ""ugh, the ending sucked because it was just an obvious sequel setup"" but I honestly really liked it? Like, yeah, it was an obvious sequel set-up, but because it showed Alita proactively working towards getting closer to being sent to Zalem as this inevitable showdown thing, it didn't feel so cheap. It felt like open-ended closure, if that makes sense. Even if we the audience don't see it because part 2 doesn't get made, it's still going to happen in the story. I dunno, it worked really nicely for me.

Otherwise, I really dug it. Script was kind of clunky in places and the big eyes are still a baffling style choice to me, but the action was incredible and I loved the world. For being full of robots, it felt very alive.",aoc6mr

egp2hxn,"Amazing action sequences and incredible world building. Alita herself is brought to life perfectly by Rosa Salazar. It's a James Cameron production, so it is actually shot for 3D and the added price is definitely worth it.

Only flaws IMO were the rather abrupt ending and Hugo. Every time I saw Hugo my immediate reaction was Justin Bieber... and that problem kind of bled into the romantic elements too. It's weird how a fully CGI character with huge anime eyes and all the other CGI characteres didn't break my immersion, but a human character did.

All-in-all, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out in theaters in 3D.

ehfl6ba,"Just saw this movie.

I had heard of Alita through the internet, I knew nothing about the movie or the manga. I was initially put off by Alita's huge eyes, but James Cameron intrigued me.

Decided I should give it a chance, and wow! What a delight it was! I'm honestly blown away by how good it was. Not only was the cgi well done, it was filled with small details that made me appreciate the mpvie.

The city felt alive and diverse, there were various architectural styles, they nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic, and Alita is a true badass. Her strength doesn't come out of nowhere, she earns it. She isn't a 'woman who don't need no man', she's human on the inside, and needs other people to help her. Just like normal men or women, she's vulnerable and naive. She loses her innocence and tries to hide it. She felt so refreshing and so relatable.

And the movie is brutal! They didn't shy away from violence, and Alita is ruthless when she needs to be. The fight scenes are fun and gripping.

I hope they do a sequel because the ending reveal came out of nowhere and made me excited.

I don't understand why or how this movie got such low scores. It's not only visually perfect, the story is good too. This isn't an identity crisis and loss like Ghost in the Shell, but it still has compelling themes that tie together well.",aoc6mr

Only thing I didn't get, why didn't Hugo explain to Alita that the bounty hunter framed him? He just kept insisted he never killed anyone.",aoc6mr
eh0jmtp,"This comment may be way too late to post but I just saw the film and I was pleasantly surprised with it. I think as an action film it did great with battle scenes and the robot gore it showed. Obviously this isn’t really a movie where there is an important central theme like “forgive others” or “learn to love yourself” so it shines in the aspects of action entertainment.

One big problem I had with the movie though is the third act. The ending parts of this film felt rushed and a bit messy. For example, it felt very quick for Alita to kill Grewishka and Vector and go on to watch Hugo die. Then there was the time jump that immediately went to Alita as a MotorBall superstar and the movie just abruptly ended there. I think that the movie could’ve wrapped up better by not doing that time jump or at least giving some context to what happened after the 2 months or so.

Overall, this movie was pretty great and I would watch it again for fun but not so much for purely plot.",aoc6mr
ei7rxfn,"Watched Alita twice. Was so engrossed in the film first time around that I only really noticed its flaws in the rewatch.

&#x200B;

**Lows**: The romance bits between Alita and Hugo made me cringe to death. Was literally asking myself over and over again ""can the lines get any cheesier than this?"" BUT I'm guessing they're trying to remain faithful to the original manga, and Alita IS a teenage girl after all so it is understandable. but goddamn was Hugo's character awful. The acting was **so** wooden, and the lines he had didn't exactly help either. Relieved to see that this seems to be the most commonly voiced critique in this thread. I wouldn't go as far as taking all the love scenes out of the movie completely, but removing a lot of it would have definitely resulted in more favorable reviews imo. By far the weakest part of an otherwise amazing film.

The second main letdown was the script. Some of the lines delivered were **incredibly** awkward. I cannot stand by in the presence of evil, yes father (or something like that), Hugo's flirt lines and Grewishka's stereotypical villain lines (There are worlds above worlds, dance little flea x10000) are the ones that instantly come to mind. Even if these lines were taken straight for the manga, I would have at least adapted them somewhat. Let's put it this way: if I were to watch this movie blindfolded and without any prior knowledge of the movie's background, I would have thought that this was a movie created by high-schoolers for their project in film class or something....

And lastly, an unsatisfying ending that is clearly meant to pave the way for a sequel. This isn't necessarily a bad thing per se, but it is a legitimate complaint for those who were looking for a more ""complete film"" experience (**\*cough\*** critics **\*cough\***).

&#x200B;

**Highs**: The graphics, action scenes and world-building. Felt absorbed into the world of Iron City. Fighting scenes are some of the coolest I've ever seen in my life. And lastly, the film looked visually appealing, to say the least.

&#x200B;

**Highest high**: Alita. The actress did a terrific job in making Alita a very likeable character with development as the film progressed. She's not some all-righteous, impeccable heroine but a flawed teenage girl with a sassy and combative attitude yet boasting a compassionate and human/""cute"" side to her at the same time. Given the context and everything, Alita's character just felt....believable.

&#x200B;

7-7.5/10. Awesome experience that was noticeably weighed down by its (relatively) crappy dialogue and stereotypically cheesy teenage romance arc. In my opinion, the aforementioned strengths of this film made up for its other shortcomings. In a way, it's a bit of a shame. This could have easily been a 9 or even 10/10 film in my eyes had they hire a competent screenwriter and improve the romance bits. Because of this, I can definitely see someone who gives a lot of importance to a film's dialogue and depth to its plot to rate Alita much, much lower. To each his/her own, I suppose.",aoc6mr

I will preface this by saying I haven't read the manga.

- The ending was ... abrupt. I was waiting for the final showdown, explanations and so on and ... it just ended. So many questions unanswered.

- Possibly connected to that, at several point in the movie it felt like story was cut short.

- The villains were terrible. Vector, Grewishka, Nova, even Zapan were pretty damn uninteresting and lacking in any kind of motivation. 

This feels like lot of anime. The adaptation is good enough to get you interested, but feel incomplete enough to get you to read the source material. So, I will go do just that.

The action plus the sound effects just make you really get on the edge of your seat and try ducking some of the punches and kicks coming, really great VFX and SFX. If Alita wasn't fighting Cyborgs this movie would be a hard R in some of the things she does.

Alita doesn't look out of place at all being with humans and being in this world that they have created, she looks pretty damn good in fact. The only Cyborg that looked wrong in any way while I was watching was [The Male Lead's cyborg body, though I guess it was cause he just got decapitated and they just needed to strap him in any body they could find](#spoiler).

Great acting from Rosa Salazar as Alita (especially acting while wearing the suit must've been a first for her), Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali, and Jennifer Connelly. Resident bad guy Ed Skrein does his job and the only one that feels like if they could change the acting/actor they would would be the Male Lead in Keean Johnson.

Would really love a sequel, I'll probably go read and watch the source material but there is definitely enough crazy stuff that deserves to be shown on the big screen to the biggest audience. 

This movie gets a 7.5 (Could be an 8 but the love story and the Male Lead just doesn't cut it and drops the movie 0.5 points). Great Visual Effects, great booming Sound Effects, Alita is a great character, there's a decent story that compliments the great action, and there's a good amount of side characters like Dr. Ido, Zapan, Vector and the Dog Master to really just have an enjoyable time watching this movie. 7.5.",aoc6mr

eghyxhi,"Something I found interesting was how the futuristic, cybernetic premise gave a different take on the process of growing up, or transitioning into a woman. She begins as a girl, in a girl's body, is naive and innocent etc. Later when she gets the berzerker body, she subconsciously molds it into a more ""developed"" image of herself, something the nurse directly comments on. This literal physical exchanging of her body tied into the process of maturing past her girlish stage was pretty unique because of this sci-fi premise.

\-Edit, added observation- Also, she got the berzerker body in the first place, not only by proving that she was worthy; by her bravery and sense of good, but also because her old self was torn apart (both literally in a physical manner, and emotionally by learning the harder, darker truth of the world and human nature, which is a motif you see a lot in numerous “coming of age” stories).",aoc6mr

There were a couple times I thought the pacing was a bit quick but overall I think it made good use of it's runtime. Also I've totally gotten used to the eyes at this point. I actually have a hard time imagining the movie without them. 

There were some surprisingly funny lines in this movie too. Nova's ""That looks fatal"" when he was [controlling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvbCgnCJoA) Vector was great. And the Dog hunter's ""He is not a dog person, I hate that"" was hilarious.  I wish we saw more of that guy. 

The weakest part of the movie was definitely Hugo and the love story. When he died I just kinda went [""eh""](https://i.gifer.com/3LkF.gif). The relashinship between Alita and Ido was much more interesting, but I'm a sucker for father-daughter relationships in movies. 

I really hope this makes enough for a sequel though. Maybe if the new Avatar movies make bank again Cameron can push for more movies. 

edit: Totally forgot to mention the fantastic character design. All of the cyborgs looked great, but Zapan was a standout. Was that a Mayan calendar on his back? I don't know but it was cool as hell. ",aoc6mr
esxk770,"Welp I'm lost. Please help me out.  
1. Why Ido/Chiren got banished from Zalem. Why Chiren wanted to go back up so badly? Why Ido wanted to stay down?  
2. Alita's heart is URM tech. Citizens know it is not valuable (scavengers left the ship for 300 years alone). Why did Hugo had to conjure a cheesy lie not to accept it?

3. How come Alita made to ""win"" the tryouts when she busted out of tracks?  
4. Why Vector's champ is lurking in the shadows down below? Is he suppose to be in Zalem because he's a champ?  
5. Zapan said interference with Hunter-Warrior and his kill is violation of The Factory law, so he let Alita do her kill. To my surprise, Zapan stabbed Hugo even with Centurions present. What happened there?

eut7bfo,"Just saw on SD DVD - even at 576i, the CG is amazing.

Though the head of *Grewishka* (I mean the ape-like one who gets a fist to the eye) looks fuzzy, like a Gears of War character (the first game).

2 hours is a longish movie. Yet it felt rushed, like a too-closely-edited teaser, and a montage at times, with still reflective moments cut short - even the music seemed cut! At the same time, threads are unfinished. Testament to the source material, I guess!

Overall, great graphics, great characters, great story - but justice wasn't done to them. Maybe Jim can remake it after Avatar *n*.

EDIT it feels like it was edited for length, so a director's cut could be good. Unfortunately, because CG is so expensive, probably most of the cuts weren't fully rendered, so it wouldn't be straightforward. There might only be a couple minutes worth of rendered scenes, whereas I reckon the total cuts could easily be 30-60 minutes.",aoc6mr

But I loved the world they built, and I loved Alita right from the start. I saw it in a 3D IMAX theater, and it's easily far and away the best 3D experience I've ever had in a theater...it might be the only movie I can name other than Avatar where the 3D was actually worth it.

A lot of stuff is rushed which makes sense as I heard they crammed a couple of arcs together, like the beginning with the slasher guy it just kinda happens and everyone moves on. Or that the whole hugo alita romance was cute but I wouldn't have made it the core of the movie like it seemed to be, along with some characters like Chiren and dr ido getting their arcs fast forwarded. Too much sequel bait as well when the story just ends here.

The fights were anime as fuck and it was awesome, I definitely wanted more.

* Really likeable protagonist. She carried the movie spectacularly.
* Great supporting actors (most of all Christoph Waltz, but Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali were good too).
* Great worldbuilding and cyberpunk vibe. Loads of little details and character in the environments and the setting.
* Excellent CGI (wouldn't expect anything else from a James Cameron film). Alita's eyes quickly became endearing and likeable. Amazing shots of neon lights reflected in rainy streets; incredible action sequences.
* Plot danced around a bit at first, but came together very well in the middle and towards the end. Would have liked a little more exposition on the ""big bad"" however.

Really hope they get to make a sequel!

The film is so assembled and plot carried this way, that there is no time to be overfed with action or get bored by lack of it, its is balanced perfectly: timing, emotions, visuals, the way fights are designed... I have no idea how the director did this, but I didn't notice those 2 h 22 m passed, I was sort of surprised it is over so quickly. So somehow, this film is a masterpiece, a work of art, hated by critics and beloved by the audience. (By the way, critics ranked Aquaman higher than Alita, we can't treat them seriously)

I went, only because my people were going, I am not manga fan, I didn't like trailer, but when the movie ended, I wanted to go back and see it again.",aoc6mr

egd1hs8,"I loved this movie.
Obviously I'm generalizing but I don't really understand why this subreddit celebrates Aquaman and yet wants to shit on this movie when it's like a better, nerdier, weebier version of what Aquaman was trying to accomplish. 
There's lots of flaws in this movie like the clunky dialogue and overstuffed plotting plus the characters in general except for Alita are at best generic and at worst Hugo, but whenever Alita is in a scene doing whatever (especially when she's handing out beatdowns) this movie is such a blast.
That scene where she executes a one arm handstand into backflip and rams her fist into that dude's face. The Motorball scene where she pummels another dude with his own lopped off arm. When she rips through that room of security mechs. And peak anime goodness hits you when she literally splits her falling tear in two with her sword. If you can't unironically enjoy a flawed yet fun, energetic and inventive movie like this, I don't know who hurt you. 
I really hope we get a sequel, hopefully with better writing. And with more spectacular cyborg anime battles of course. 
",aoc6mr

eggodu9,"Overall I did enjoy the movie. 

For better or worse its a fairly faithful adaptation of the OVA (itself being an adaptation of the manga). Although the OVA did not have Motorball. 

Honestly, I got over the eyes fairly quickly.

The visuals are amazing in this movie, but where it falls kinda flat is the story. There is a story in there, but I feel like it isn't really explained well, or the way motivations are built isn't done right.

I almost feel like this is because it really isn't in the source material (at least in the OVA). It's almost like in an anime you kinda just go along with it and say ""yeah sure she has to beat the bad guys and defeat Nova b/c"" and don't need much other story fleshing out. 

I do wish they kinda kept Yugo/Hugo (was he called Hugo or Yugo, b/c its Yugo in the anime I believe), anyways I wish they kept him more aloof with Alita. He was originally not interested in her and it was a one sided type relationship.

The action was very good. I do wish we got more of it. Maybe more hand to hand type combat like the underground fight. I also wish they hadn't given Alita that sword so she could use her plasma fingertips. It was hinted at, but not used in battle. 

Also near the end of the movie, Hugo kept calling Alita, Allie. Could this be a reference to her Japanese original name, Gally?


Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but I can see why it might not do well. It 100% leaves you wanting more. It feels like the first half of an anime series where the main villain is revealed and the second half would be reaching that main villain.

Speaking of which, Ed Norton! I was surprised. 

Anyways. The movie is enjoyable. Looked great in IMAX 3D. I hope it will get a sequel, but sadly doubt it. It was a visual treat, but the story fell a little flat from what I expect in movie storytelling. Maybe not as flat as... let's say Valerian (also a visual treat). ",aoc6mr
egkcuew,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by it. I was thoroughly engaged throughout all of the fight scenes and you completely forget that you're watching a CGI character after the first few scenes. The whole love story definitely should've been scrapped though as that is the main area where the plot drags. Unfortunately it was basically the focal point of the emotional narrative when I really think they should've gone more for the Father/Daughter angle.

All in all, highly entertaining. Visual effects were absolutely fantastic. I'm somewhat hopeful for a sequel but there's no way they throw another $175 million at this project.",aoc6mr

But having Rodriguez and Cameron involved assured not just a visual spectacle and great action, but a faithful adaptation of one of the most beloved Manga ever printed.

I reminded me of Pacific Rim with the PG action and global friendly script, but I also liked that movie a lot more than other people. I don't mind simple wholesome characters if things keep building up to these awesome action scenes with revenge fantasies being fulfilled so spectacularly.

eginw8n,"Wow, I gotta say as a lifelong fan of Gunnm/Battle Angel, who has been waiting for over a decade for this movie (I was so frustrated when Cameron made Avatar instead), this was 100% perfect and exceeded my expectations in every way! Gunnm was one of the primary reasons I became an artist, it was so inspiring to me. I kept remembering things from the manga right before they happened, and it was so wonderful to see them done so fantastically. I always felt like Rollerball was the weakest part of the saga (well, besides most of Last Order) but even that was absolutely stunning in this in iMax 3D.

The cast was basically perfect, I always saw Wynona Ryder as Alita but alas she's too old now, Rosa Salazar did a great job though. I especially liked Ido and Vector. It's a shame there's not much Nova in this part of the story, he is my favorite character.

It is just an absolute love letter to fans, I can't even believe a big budget movie this accurate to a somewhat obscure 90s manga managed to get created. I sure hope it does well enough overseas to have more! Sadly enough it stops at the same place the anime did, and in my opinion that's right before the story really takes off.

When JEH's character in his big goofy cloak and the other two pop out, I felt like ""Oh wow, this really feels like an anime in live action"". 

At that point, I was super in. I also loved when JEH's character jumps down below the bar and creates a huge hole in the ground for Alita to follow. That in particular was so video game-esque. That whole sequence was awesome! The fight scenes throughout were excellent and Rosa Salazar, Waltz and JEH in particular were all great.

egczb2b,"I fucking loved this movie. In an age where most big-budget films are the same franchises, I was excited to see a film that's willing to try something new, even though this film is destined to lose a ludicrous amount of money.

I read the first half of the manga in preparation of this film. I'm gonna be the first to say it, the movie is a significant improvement on the source material. Kishiro's original story was written without any sort of future plan, and the manga suffered for it. The pacing was too rapid, for example. Like, Alita is found in chapter 1. In chapter 2 she discovers Ido is a hunter-warrior (I'm surprised they kept that terminology, its a little awkward sounding). In chapter 3 she becomes one herself. In chapter 4 she gets the berserker body. Then she spends a few chapters fighting Grewishka (Makaku in the manga) and that's it. Arc completed. Arc 2 is the same, Hugo (Yugo in Japan) is introduced, she falls for him even though he does nothing deserving of affection, and the arc concludes with [his death](#spoiler).  Arc 3 introduces motorball, and focuses on her becoming champion. 

My point is, the original manga was paced absurdly fast, and the reader is never given the chance to contextualize the world or become invested in any of Alita's relationships before stuff happens. By mashing all of these arcs up and taking its time to introduce Ido, Hugo, and Alita's discovery of the world, I feel like the narrative is much more holistic and a more emotionally resonant film.

I loved the design of the world, its really intricate. This is a weird thing to notice but I loved the directing of all the extras and background actors. Iron City feels gritty and lived in. It was crazy to keep your eyes on all the people in the background and watching them do their thing with all their cybernetic enhancements. I also think that the author said that this place is supposed to be my hometown of Kansas City, though nothing in the film indicates that except for the name of a bar, ""Kansas.""

The action is fucking dank. It'll probably be the selling point to people who find the rest of the film cliche. I've come to hate CGI-heavy superhero action, but its so damn well shot and choreographed. Alita swings around and dances through her battles. There is *weight* and *momentum* to her movements that I find lacking in a lot of similar films.

The f-bomb is well executed.

Rosa Salazar and Kristoph Waltz gave decent performances. The kid who played Hugo did alright considering the character was completely insufferable in the comic. Everyone else was passable. I wish Mahershala Ali had more to do.

Once you become used to them, you don't notice the eyes as much. 

The one thing I was disappointed about was that the film ends on a heavy sequel hook. Never call your shot with the first film!!! Hasn't anybody learned anything from the Golden Compass?

Anyway, I'll finish up now. I don't expect most people to enjoy this film nearly as much as I did, but I would like people to at least give it a shot. I want more weird big-budget films in the world. If we don't blockbusters will continue to be complacent and same-y!",aoc6mr
egfw7vr,"It stayed faithful enough to the manga and took good liberties when it needed to.

Others have already said the pacing was a bit off, scenes went so quickly, it could have used a few more minutes, maybe there will be a director's cut.

egkpxsp,"Just  finished watching it today.   A bit sloppy, but fun to watch... and that was only because I was familiar with the source material from back in the day.  The scrapyard was a joke and should have been much grimier and trash like.   Hugo should have gone crazy because he lost his body and couldn't feel or touch like he used to, and that should have driven him to make the climb.   Little touches here and there in the writing and there could have made it much better.    Hugo was never meant to be anything more than a stepping stone for Alita to grow, not some big movie all about their romance.   Considering how    

Ending could have been a bit better,  instead of Nova taking off his ""glasses"" which made me think ""REALLY!?  WTF!!!"" they should have had him observe Alita with amusement, ""There is an interesting toy to play with..."" then take a long savory slurp of FLAN!

I think they have potential with the live action version of Nova as a decently done villain with how he is presented. Instead of being chaotic crazy, he's just bored ""immortal"" crazy and should see Alita as a new toy to observe for his ""karmic"" theories of souls to idle away his time. 

While I adapted to the stupid real life anime eyes theme they gave the Martian warriors in the film, it was still a damned poor choice.   Alita was also known for dem lips too!  Rad an effective enough look to fill the role of Alita without that CGI warping.   If only Jessica Alba were as young as she used to be she was the perfect fit for that role... just born a bit too damned early...

But I'm pretty sure some people who are completely new to Alita will take it as they see it.  Some will like it, others will not.  Overseas it will probably do very well, and in Japan it will probably blow up for all the pure otaku to go see. I would give this movie a 7/10.",aoc6mr

It's not high art but it's obvious that it wasn't made to be considering the experimental nature of the main character and how niche the source material is.

I don't understand why everyone thinks there should be less Hugo. Its a coming of age story about a teenage girl. There's going to be alot about a boy.  It wouldn't make sense for her character if there wasn't. 

I also don't know why people think there won't be a sequel.  It's James Cameron.. even if it bombed really really bad, if that guy snaps his finger he's getting what he wants.  You can tell in interviews this film holds a really special spot in his heart. He hated not having time for it because of Avatar and having to give up directing. At the same time I think he trusted Rodriguez.  There's no reason to think he won't want to continue it.  Studios have zero say in a sequel imo, it's all about what Cameron wants.

Wasn't expecting a great movie, but it was still a great watch. Alita beat the guy at the end pretty easily. Makes me believe that when she gets to the sky city, she will have a much harder battle. 

I could see this having a prequel and sequel. ",aoc6mr
egio67m,"After being pretty badly disappointed with other adaptations of comics/manga, and being a huge fan of this particular manga AND someone keenly aware that they're now older than the main targeted audience, I was really afraid I wouldn't like this, but I am so happy I saw it!! The action scenes were arm-thumpingly fun, reminiscent of the fun I had when I saw Mad Max Fury Road, and yes the dialogue was cheesy but it drew from pretty cheesy source material (I say that with love) and makes sense in that light. It of course did chop up and move/merge a bunch of storylines/characters around (since of course the costs to implement any character or scene in a budget concious film add up, one's gotta condense things, I get it), but I think it did this in a fairly efficient and thoughtful way. I think that fact that it stayed silly and 'cute' (and not necessarily by American executive-driven standards) helped it SO much, as trying to get too gritty would have forced a need for more current-world realism in the writing, and as such I wasn't seeking that like I usually do and it WORKED.



The casting was pretty spectacular (probably the character I found most annoying in that sense was Hugo who did look pretty Mickey Mouse club-y, but even then he kinda works if considering who he was portraying from the manga, i.e. a silly, showboating adolescent who sparks Alita's puppy love despite not being particularly deep or cool). The diverse characters really kept things interesting visually and even audibly (different accents in a suppposed thrown together messy melting pot (as the scrapyard was conceived to be) really go a long way) and the visual background worldbuilding was almost constant, and did an awesome job of 'show don't tell'.


I was afraid Alita would come off as too creepy looking or too ""cringy westernized anime"" but she looked better in movement than she did in preview pics, plus in context of the URM all being that way it serves pretty well to distinguish her from regular ""Earth"" people while paying cheeky homage to the anime style. She is intensely emotional/dramatic to the point where people who haven't read the manga might find her super unrealistic, I can see that, but she's staying true to her character as originally written. I LOVED Mahershala Ali as Vector and Christoph Waltz as Ido and the glimpse of Ed Norton made me laugh. I was afraid the addition of new characters would be weirdly superfluous considering how much material they already had to jam into a couple of hours, but they didn't take up a lot of time or distract from the main storyline and they fit in pretty well with the established aesthetic.



I was even afraid to lose 'Octopus lips', but her big-ass eyes kind of took the place of that :P",aoc6mr
egiouuh,"I've only ever watched the OVA. It became my favorite anime growing up, I watched it over and over, so I was really nervous and excited to watch the movie. I was happy and surprised that I liked it! It had a few moments of cringe, and me being upset about the differences from the anime but I remind myself that it's allowed to be different,  I can still enjoy it. 

I loved every moment Alita was on screen. I love that she didn't think too long about any decisions she made, she was always very sure of herself.  She loved fully,  she hated fully, shes so full of feeling. All or nothing.  I love her. 

I hated Hugo in this movie, and I caught myself looking forward to his death. That romantic plot was lame. I much prefer his storyline in the anime better. Yugo is not a good person, all he ever cared about was making money and getting to Zalem, he was obsessed, and that's what made his character interesting. I hate that they tried to make him a good guy in the movie.  I only cared about his death in the anime because I care about Gally. 

Everyone else was great (except that dog guy...wtf)

 I'm inspired to read the manga. (Can someone recommend where I can find it online to read?) I hope they keep making these movies.  I may have to watch it again. 

7/10 because you just can't top childhood nostalgia.",aoc6mr
egiqwas,"I never read the source material so i can't comment on the film's fidelity but I was very satisfied by what I watched. The visuals were **SPECTACULAR**. Easily the best to date. I feel this will age well much like *Avatar* has. Rosa and Waltz were great, and really the only two characters I really cared about. The action sequences were exhilirating and overall I was engaged. 

That said, the script could've used a few more re-writes. Aside from Alita and the Dr., everyone else was just underdeveloped. Especially the villain Nova. I get they were trying to make him mysterious but they could've at least made his presence feel menacing throughout the course of the film. And the love story was completely unnecessary. And not to mention cheesy. 

Still though, I enjoyed it.

egltzrk,"Saw the film yesterday. As a fan of the manga series who got into it after watching the anime movie, here's a few thoughts:

+Rosa Salazar was great as Alita. Don't care about the eyes, she was beautiful. 

-Keean Johnson seemed to be a little bland as Hugo. Wish they'd went a little more into his past though. It's mentioned in the prequel novel, but I think it would have added a little extra.

+Christoph Walz was great as Ido. Loved how they made the hammer look too. Kind of interesting how they made him pull out his ""mark"" chip.

-Didn't like Zapan's look initially, although his back art is cool. Stil say he needed the jaw spikes. Interesting to see he did have a mark  on his forehead like in the manga, but it was a lot more subtle.

+Motorball designs were excellent. Wasn't that Caligula Armblessed in green? Loved seeing Jashugan in film form.

+Loved the take on Alita's past. Taking elements from the manga and anime to make a twist on the story is interesting, I'd like to see how any sequels will go.

+Loved McTeague and his hounds. Definately want him back for his part in a sequel.

-Kind of disappointed the fight with Clive Lee didn't happen.

+The fights were epic and quite violent. I get the feeling that the film avoided a higher rating simply because the violence was mostly mechanical and bloodless.

+>!""Fuck your mercy""!< Loved that bit.

+Seriously, Motorball scenes were great.

-Nova's glasses shouldn't be removable (except for that one time in the Oroborous program)

-Anyone else think Nova needed to be holding a plate of flan at the end? Just seems wrong to have him without.

+Motorball needs to be a video game. Bonus points for VR compatibility.

egnevjm,"I watched it last night. I've been a huge Alita fan since I read the comics as a teenager back in the 90s. I was very apprehensive watching this movie, as I thought it'd turn out like all other anime adaptations.

I was amazed by this movie. Probably the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen.

My one gripe was Nova. Weird they placed him in Zarem, considering he's an outcast in the comics. It felt like it was an attempt to force in an ""people above oppressive, oppression bad"" theme. I suspect it was Laeta Kalogridis' work, as the did the same thing in Altered Carbon.",aoc6mr
ego3t7a,Saw it last night and a really enjoyed. Thought Hugo was the worst thing about it though. And they way they handled his death was stupid. Glad he’s gone though. He was a trash character and brought the movie down a few points. I just started the manga too. And I’m appreciating all the character details they added. The manga is amazing but I love the small details they added to the relationships. 7/10 movie. Can’t wait for a sequel. ,aoc6mr

I absolutely hated the love interest though.

Cant wait for the inevitable sequel though.  And really excited to read the manga.",aoc6mr

Rosa Salazar and Christoph Waltz played their roles perfectly. (Yes I am a guy, and I enjoy female 'heroes')

Having a giant sequel setup hanging over the film's setting the entire movie when you don't even know if it's going to get a sequel is not a great idea.

ehgz3c8,"I know it wasn't perfect. It had it's flaws, but it was ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. When walking out of the cinema, I was out of this world. The wind felt refreshing and I a few tears might've escaped my mind.

Alita cries. She's gentle and beautiful. Her movement is incredible and so fluent, so soft. She fights with such confidence and strenght. 

Even if the motorball scenes are a bit weird and might feel out of place, they're... just... I can't describe it with words. It's just something else.

Is Hugo perfect? No. Is the plot perfect? No. Do I care? Nope.",aoc6mr
ehoneuy,"I thought it was a great movie and one thing that I've noticed is that while some movies like this are a ""either you love it or hate it"" type, in this case I've talked to so many people who said that its was ""pretty good though with flaws"" but also saying that for some reason they keep thinking and mulling over the overall movie, characters and dialogue days or weeks later.  More so than the CGI.  

So there is definitely something special in Alita that connects with people if they initially just commented to me that it was a good fun popcorn flick.  My friends and I never keep talking and thinking about a popcorn flick even a few hours after seeing it.",aoc6mr
ehz7ols,"Late for the party, but I just watched it. Everything about the movie was great except for Hugo. Aside from the shitty generic acting, I don't get how he didn't figure out that vector was after Alita?

How did they not make the connection? ",aoc6mr

egiounp,"So everyone is going to shit all over the boyfriend character, maybe deservedly so, but honestly I thought most of the scenes with him were good, and a couple easy fixes would've gone a long, longggg way:

1. Actually show why he wants to go to the sky city so badly. He doesn't seem desperate enough to ever agree to mug robots for parts; it just doesn't seem like something that ever would've been in character for him.
2. Straighten out that mess of a last scene with him. To have him nearly die, then come back as cyborg, and then die all over again in the span of ten minutes just does not work

So basically, strengthen his first couple scenes and his last couple scenes and he would've been a significantly better character",aoc6mr

Jesus Christ, this was the biggest surprise I have in years. What a fantastic movie. Yes the script is a bit overloaded and dragged at the end, but it is good enough to build the action on.

The world building and use of CGI is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. The whole movie looks insane. Never in my life have I seen a fictional world that felt so real. Even more impressive because the majority of characters is at least partly CGI. Imo the best use of CGI I have ever seen in a movie. You can tell that they put extra work in every single scene.

Alitas character is so good. She switches from sweet and innocent to brutal killer in a second and it never feels forced. so well done.

It was at that point I realized ""This movie is probably never getting a sequel.""

Like, visually it was great. Deserves all sorts of awards. Huge set pieces that were really impressive on the big screen. But as an actual movie it... kinda sucked. Pacing was bad, ~~Michelle Rodriguez's cameo~~*most of the minor enemies Alita fought* were laughably dumb, Jennifer Connelly's character arc is sitting on the editing room floor, Alita's boyfriend character was cringe-y. When Alita's character walked into her spaceship and all the lights turned on I was like ""what the fuck is happening right now?"" and I legitimately felt like I should've done research into the source material before watching the movie, which is not a great thing to think about in a movie.

egmn0i2,"On the one hand, the dialogue ranged from passable to corny to cringey, and I suspect a lot of that was the result of staying as close to the manga as possible.

On the other hand, holy fuck the action sequences were some of the most spectacular I have *ever* seen, and I haven't seen a movie that sold me on an SF world so spectacularly since, well, *Avatar*.

On the other other hand, the movie clearly suffered from Cameron and Rodriguez trying to pack as much of the manga as humanly possible into a movie runtime because they knew it probably isn't getting a sequel. 

On the other other other hand, while a lot of the acting was hammy as fuck, Christoph Waltz and Rosa Salazar (or whatever there was of Salazar showing through the CGI) were both great.

egz2qnk,"I enjoyed the movie. Thought it looked great and was pretty fun. My biggest gripe would have to be with Alita/Hugo relationship. It felt a bit too melodramatic at times with parts feeling like it wasn't adapted from a Japanese manga but from an American YA novel. Also, I think they could have done more to make Iron city seem more dangerous as >!apart from the serial killings earlier in the movie!<, it really seemed like a not bad place to live.

&#x200B;

I haven't read the manga and know nothing about it, so maybe the love story was always a part of  it, but I feel like there was some sort of mid-production rewrite to make the love story more important that causes a plot hole. **Spoilers:** >!Hugo takes the arm with the tendril spike things from the guy and gives it to Vector. Later, he's at the bar with Alita when the big guy comes in, now equipped with said arm that he procured. There is a clear and purposeful shot of his reaction to seeing the arm on the bad guy trying to kill Alita. Nothing happens with this. The movie makes it plainly clear that he reacted to the arm, yet nothing comes from it. He goes to see Vector and talks about Alita with absolutely no suspicion on his mind. He just doesn't connect the dots, it just seems like the screenwriter, editor and director just forgot that they filmed him reacting to it and still used it. I think maybe there was going to be some kind of confrontation between Hugo and Vector and that would spill into him being framed for murder and so on. But maybe some executive or focus group didn't think the love story was strong enough for some of the later stuff that happens between Hugo and Alita to be believable or they wanted a more YA Novel feel like Hunger Games, etc. So they removed the confrontation(forgetting about the reaction shot earlier) and then added in more romantic scenes like the body touching and then the scene where she tries to give him her heart. As well as adding the scene with Vector where he talks about being close to going to the floating city.!<

I may be off-base, as again I don't know if this happened in the manga or not, but it just seem kinda retroactively jammed in.

Apart from that though I did enjoy the movie. I think Rose Salazar did great. I like how it ends as well, with ~~Becky Lynch~~ Alita pointing to ~~the WrestleMania sign~~ Zalem.",aoc6mr
eh3izg4,"Huge fan of the manga and its sequels and I think it turned out fairly well. As a big fan I really enjoyed the that they used a lot from the original series, like the nods to all the old characters from the manga, some of the set pieces like Bar Kansas and the motorball circuit, and all the terminology they carried over. I'll be upfront though, I never had a chance to watch the OVA so I'm not very familiar with the differences between it and the manga. 

My gripes are:
 
-Motorball could have easily have been a part of a later film and could have been super compelling if it was more fleshed out. Alita already had a great story of learning more about her past while becoming a hunter warrior, hunting Grewishka/Makaku, and finally culminating in [Hugo's death](#spoiler) before becoming a motorball player like she does in the Manga. The following movie could have been her playing motorball while trying to track down Zapan [after he murders his girlfriend and goes berserk with help of Nova](#spoiler)

-Hugo should have been [more of a criminal. The fact that they were only paralyzed cyborgs to me wasn't enough of an evil therefore making it less of an evil to forgive for Alita in my opinion. That would have given his plot more weight and the decision to turn him in or save him more of a heartbreaking decision.](#spoiler) 

-Christoph Waltz and Edward Norton should have swapped roles. I feel like Waltz would have made an incredible Desty Nova while Norton I feel would have been able to play a flesh and blood hunter-warrior better than Waltz. Just think of Waltz and the scene eating pastries from Inglorious Basterds and Nova with flan. (On a sidenote, Marshala Ali was such a great Vector. [I really wish they didn't kill him off because he could have been so great as he became more of an important part of the plot like in the manga] (#spoiler))

-If they were going to bring up Mars and ""the Fall""/the Terraforming Wars so early they should have done a little more explaining why Alita is actually not the good guy that she might think she is because [her and her unit were the one responsible for causing Zalem/Tiphares to break away from the scrapyard/Iron City.](#spoiler) I really feel like this would have been something that broke her down and made her question her existence and whether or not she really did deserve her second chance. 

-The panzerkunst was kind of underutilized in my opinion. In the series it is an extremely powerful martial art that literally has no equal in close quarters combat and in the movie it just seems like shes just really good at martial arts. I'll admit it would have been difficult to put in some of the more entertaining moves in the film but if they could have figured it out it would have been a great payoff. Maybe by starting off showing shes a fairly capable fighter in normal martial arts before she has to use a distinctive panzerkunst move in the climax which she does relatively frequently in the manga as she remembers more of her past.

-Iron City/Scrapyard just looked too nice. In the source material, to quote a wise man, ""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."" It is a really rotten place where only the strong survive and even ""good"" people have done something evil in the name of survival. (I'm looking at you Ido.) The film version just looks to....positive? Like, I get it, there needs to be something to show they can survive as a city, however I seriously couldn't stop noticing dudes in tank tops and cargo shorts. It didn't need to be filmed entirely at night but dammit, there is a reason why Hugo is willing to [kill people and cut their spines out of their bodies for money](#spoiler). 

I just came back from watching the movie and still have a lot to process so there might be more but this is it for now. TBH, I'm not expecting anyone to read this but I just had to say it. ",aoc6mr
eh7508h,"Wow I thought the trailers for this movie looked bad but they did it no justice— I thought the movie was awesome.

At the end nobody got out of their seats hoping for an end credits scene.

This one really surprised me ",aoc6mr
ehdrzhn,"Just saw the movie for the second time, this time in 3D. The effects looked even better but unless you normally see 3D movies it’s probably not entirely worth that extra bit.

I noticed a lot more detail in the actual human violence on the second watch through such as when Hugo’s friend gets cut in half there’s a comical blood spray from the wound. I wonder if there’s perhaps an R-rated cut left on the editing room floor. If anything, this is probably the most gorey/violent PG-13 movie I’ve ever seen; only saved by the fact most everyone was synthetic.

Overall I’d say 9/10 for both viewings.",aoc6mr
ehhfml7,"I went into seeing this purely off the trailers, with no knowledge of the manga or OVA that its based on. Absolutely loved it. Was engrossed in the story the whole time, and it never felt predictable. The entire film was beautiful too, from the cinematography to all the CGI. Everything worked perfectly in my opinion.

I gave it a 4/5 on Letterboxd though because it did kind of piss me off that it just ended right before that big final race. Again, no knowledge going into this, so I was expecting a self contained film.",aoc6mr

eited0a,"Saw in 3-D. This movie is A+ visually. I’m not sure I’ve seen anything like it. The action is great too. 

But man, the script is just bad. Some very good actors in it, and as well as Waltz acted, not he nor Connelly or Ali were interesting and the love interest kid could not have been worse. The dialogue is so utterly amateur. Like TV movie bad. The whole focus on the romantic plot kinda ruined the movie for me. The plot itself was subpar, but not terrible. We do not learn anything about Zalem, I guess they are saving that? 

I didn’t really understand rollerball. Ok there’s a ball and track and whoever has the ball at finish line wins, meanwhile there are no rules to what you can do to the other players? You can just literally all out murder them with missles, etc? Ok. 

But to end on a positive, and return to my initial comment, the way they captured cgi integrated with real life was astounding, seamless. The 3-D was way above average. Worth seeing just for that. ",aoc6mr
ev45ab0,"CGI is cool, love story is cringe dogshit, and how can Alita lift a huge ass metal door in the spaceship without any sign of struggle in the non-URM body, but struggle to pull up a limbless robot torso with the URM body?

2. Mashing 3 arcs into one movie and still
Having the balls to sequel bait is a bad fucking idea. The plot is really muddled. 

All that said: fuck it was fun. Everything else was top notch. Well acted and beautiful to look at. the fight scenes were really well done. It’s already the best “Anime to Live Action” movie ever. If they had just fixed those two issues it would be the best movie so far this year for me. ",aoc6mr

Glad they changed her eyes a bit. There are quite a few closeup scenes where she is 100% convincingly real even with her larger eyes.

We're the other hunters 100% CGI, or did they use their real faces for some of them? If Zapan was CGI instead of Ed Skrein's real face, that's amazing.

I liked that they didn't back down from the theme of Alita's warrior spirit being irrepressible and making its way through regardless of Ido or anyone else.

My main gripe?  I wanted to see the balisong ""butterfly knife"" damascus blade because it just looks so crazy in the manga.",aoc6mr
egoqtcm,Real happy I was convinced to pay extra for 3D! Well worth the extra upcharge! ,aoc6mr
egprhob,"Really liked this movie, Rosa Salazar totally nails Alita! The only two things that really disappointed me was how Nova and the ending was handled. Nova just spectating from above made the confrontation with Nova/Vector anticlimactic. Then, Hugo dies and we get a time jump into the credits. Would have liked to see Alita dealing with his death before rushing off to motorball, would have been a good way to reintroduce Ido since he kind of disappears. Really hope we get a sequel and don't have to wait too long!

eh07m3l,"I have to say, even as a self proclaimed anime and manga purist and someone with a deep seated hatred for how Holywood usually treats anime conversions, this one turned out very well in my opinion. Despite the semi realistic look of the movie, they actually seemed to try to emulate the overall aesthetic of the manga (and anime conversions) a good deal and they didn't entirely mangle the core story concepts like most anime Holllywood adaptations are apt to do. Great production values, music, CGI, voice work. I think the movie is a great take off spot for future films (the supposedly planned trilogy if this movie does well). I'm overall very pleasantly surprised by it. I can't wait to get it on Bluray next, or even watch it in theaters again.",aoc6mr
ehojpso,"Just saw it today. It is a good movie without being great. Alita was kick ass. When she got going she was amazing and made the movie a lot better than it should've been. 

The action was great. Did feel though the story was a bit light on and glossed over things. There is a great story in there somewhere but wasn't fleshed out enough. I feel there is a lot more story to tell hopefully in another movie. I had a problem with the ending as it just finished halfway through the story. 

7.5/10 from me. Please make another one to continue the story. ",aoc6mr
ehp8xci,"enjoyed it, but disappointed it is an unfinished story, with the discussion making a sequel look less likely.  I am getting very VERY jaded at this repeating theme of having tv series cut on a cliffhanger and stories not completed on the big screen.  Hollywood et all need to start committing to the stories they tell and not leave viewers hanging on a significant percentage of what comes out.  Why would I give you my money for 1/2 a story?  Shit, it’s enough to make one mostly read books.. at least you are guaranteed a beginning, middle and end!   I dropped my cable subscription after SEVERAL series were cut, that I was thoroughly enjoying.

Alita: Battle Angel introduced me to a world I would like to see much more of, including the back story, but it looks like that won’t be happening... yet again. Instead we will get older successful franchises rehashed and rebooted to death until the public can’t stand it anymore and they tank, instead of something new and original being supported even in the face of mediocre box office performance",aoc6mr
eisbhj4,"Finally got a chance to see it today. It's play in one of the minor/side theater, but except for the front 2 rows (a group sat in 3rd row) the room (of less than 100) was packed to my surprise, this is a reserved seating room too.

Liked the movie for sure, especially Alita. I thought the essence of her being a blank slat was perfectly captured in the movie from falling for Hugo to the speech she gave at the bar. Her odd robotic/human facial expression was great too, not sure how much if that's cgi vs the actress. Hugo was ok for me. I did feel doc's role could expand a bit, felt it was somewhat hurried. The fighting scenes ... aww, I really hope it gets a proper sequel. ",aoc6mr
ejv1raw,"This was entertaining film and Alita herself was great and carried the film. But after time passes there isn’t that much that you are left with out of the the film, there wasn’t much exploration of themes (which seems to have been saved for a sequel) and more interesting characters were sidelined in favor of action, Zapan and Hugo so didn’t get as much time as they neened to be developed. It feels very 90s movie, not cliched exactly but it didn’t offer much new and the cliffhanger ending is what most filmmakers  have mostly learned to avoid. Other people have said this would have made better HBO series which I agree with (there would not be as much but action set pieces but if it was a hit the second season might have more). Or just made modern animated tv series. I just would have liked to have have seen more of this world and it and Alita could have carried more slow paced mystery focused series.",aoc6mr

egkt7n8,"This has to be one of the most bizarre mainstream blockbusters I've ever seen, ended up kind of loving it though. my thoughts SPOILERS AHEAD:

* As someone who watched maybe one trailer months ago and hasnt been following this closely since, the eyes were very shocking and distracting at first but by the end I was more distracted by the weird overbite thing going on with her mouth, what was up with that
* The first half or so is kind of atrocious. 90% exposition, cheesy editing, contrived setups, and too much time spent on that awful boyfriend role. The other 10% was that great fight scene in the alley
* Holy shit this was violent, which I was completely not expecting from this kind of movie. Multiple decapitations, chopped off limbs, eye gouges, and a kid got fucking chopped in half(!!!), it was pretty awesome and livened up the movie a lot for me. Rodrigues really got away with a lot just by using mostly blue blood and the whole humanoid cyborg aspect (even though in the end they were all humans and one doggo being killed)
* Alita the on screen character was great. She was entirely believable as an existing being and the mocap and voice work was great. Alita the person was very weird and pretty unlikable, wildly swinging back and forth between  being recklessly selfish and pathetically clingy
* Second half was so much better, all the action set pieces worked and I actually bought the high stakes given how fucked up Alita and her boyfriend got multiple times throughout. The rollerball scene was fantastic
* Can we just talk about how completely nutso the last act got. She literally offers her boyfriend her beating heart without barely knowing a thing about him. Alita chopped her boyfriends' head and carried it around attached to her own blood supply and no one blinked an eye about it lmao. And then Jennifer Connelly gets mutilated offscreen with her brain and eyes neatly displayed in a suitcase again without much fanfare like wtf! I was completely in by this point
* That had to be one of the most fuck you endings I've ever seen, and I applaud them for being bold enough to cut the audience off basically right before the third act. It definitely jolted me up out of the recliner. Kinda sucks theres basically no chance they'll finish this story on screen, I was actually very curious to see what was up there in the floating city.
* The Dua Lipa song at the end is a bop",aoc6mr

egq9wx9,"Some movies, like this and Pacific Rim, you just want to turn off the part of your brain that identifies plot holes and enjoy the show. As many mention, the plot is okay, the love story is meh, and the sequel setup eliminates any resolution.

With that all said, can't wait to see this again. The action is amazing and the humanity of the Alita character is amazing af. The line ""I do not stand by in the presence of evil"" gave me chills. Whoever made the decision to ""anime up"" Alita to ensure the character hits just outside the uncanny valley deserves some kind of reward as being able to relate and empathize with her was key to this movie.

Funny thing, every time I Zapan, all I could think of was ""WHERE'S FRANCIS?!"".

I'm really hoping this movie does well to get the sequel we all need to see. I'm going to check out the manga but I'm wondering if I should wait to avoid spoliers/setting high expectation.",aoc6mr
egqnddp,"Thought the movie was amazing, Alita was legitimately bad ass, scene where she grabs Zapan by the neck in the bar and slams him down on the table was just one moment, in a series of amazing action sequences where I got goosebumps.

Like some unholy combination of the Matrix and Avatar. You've got well-choreographed martial arts and breathtaking 3D visuals. This is the closest Hollywood has ever come to making anime real and I don't say that lightly.

Furthermore, the story is faithful to the original. That beautiful hero's journey arc alongside all the insanity of the cyborg character designs. Alita herself might just be the most realised CGI character ever put on screen, she feels like a real person and after a time you forget she's not live action.

Overall Alita is a genuine event movie and I fervently want to see this film succeed. If Hollywood has any ounce of artistry left they should be making more films like Alita.",aoc6mr

Watching this movie in 3D filled me with that exact same sense of awe that watching Avatar for the first time gave me. Loved that it gave the image a real sense of depth without being gaudy.

The action was absolutely phenomenal and Alita was adorable, endearing, and completely badass. I have minor gripes and the story was fairly typical for the genre, but I thought it was told pretty well for the most part.

Having finally seen it, it bums me out to hear that it's already predicted to bomb. I can't emphasize enough how much I want a sequel to this.

Also, this might just be the most brutal PG-13 movie ever made. I'm both shocked and pleased at the things this movie got away with.

Like honestly Iron City doesn't seem that bad a place to live in. I think I saw tourist looking people walking around, and a chocolate stand???  Why do multiple characters want to leave for Zalem?  Compared to the Manga Comic where the city is practically lawless, literally living off of the trash heap and surrounded by desert, the movies' world is heaven.

Hugo was whatever, but really there were't many other characters that were super fleshed out. They mattered because they mattered to HER and it worked for me.

egn3p7m,"I watched this movie a couple hours ago in IMAX 3D. Like many others have said, the visuals were simply outstanding. I'll put bullet points of what I liked and disliked about the movie. Side note, I have not read the manga or read the light novel at all.

Liked:
- The action sequences. These were the closest things to epic anime battles coming to the big screen. The action was amazing and perfectly executed.
- The world building and immersion. I felt fully immersed in to the movie and nothing ever broke it for me in the film. I wanted to know more about the world, and the characters inside of it.
- Alita. The actor's (sorry I don't know her name) performance was charming, strong, and felt genuine. I was emotionally invested to her character and enjoyed seeing Alita develop through the movie. Her character arc was good.
- the scene where Alita tells Hugo ""I would give you my heart"" and then after that parts over, she says ""that was a bit intense wasn't it..."" I found that moment to be very heartwarming and genuine. I wish there were more moments like this, a little bit of self aware humor but not for the sake of ""being meta"". It was nice to see the character point out just how ridiculous the situation was, yet still maintain the truth of her words, unlike in every other over the top dramatic romance movie.
- I found myself thinking ""okay this is the end of the movie"" multiple times at the end, only to be pleasantly surprised it kept going. I was just used to movies ending off in traditional ways, after the big climax. There are multiple climaxes at the end, some larger than others, but I really enjoyed being able to see more of the story finish out after the climaxes. Basically, I was just thinking ""Yes, there's more!"" Because I wanted to continue watching this movie. I was hooked.
- The ending. The people I watched it with were a little dissapointed or confused about the ending, but I found it to be a great setup for a sequel. There's no way they'd be able to portray the entire story of Alita in one movie, so I felt they chose a great cutoff point for this first film.

Disliked:
- the dialogue. It was pretty average, but there were some parts that felt odd, forced, or just awkward. Especially toward the beginning of the movie. 
- the movie was very cheesy at some points. The dialogue added to this a lot. Most of the cringe moments happened with Alita interacting with Hugo. I especially rolled my eyes at the kissing scene, and (spoiler alert) Hugo's death. First off, HUGO SAID NOTHING BACK TO ALITA, second, the way he fell down past the clouds was so cheesy, watching him look up at Alita and all.
- the poorly executed romance between Alita and Hugo. There was nothing really notable about Hugo in the beginning. There was nothing that made me root for him at all, and I could care less about if their relationship worked out or not. It felt forced and a little rushed. I know I said Alita's character development was good and Hugo was a big part of that, but I wish they really fixed it up a bit in the script.

I would rate the movie about a 7/10, I like to be nice with movie ratings. The action and overall story carried this movie. The only thing it needed work on was how the main characters interacted with each other. Their interactions all felt a little awkward. I want to see a sequel to this movie, and I hope they make the character interactions and dialogue better.",aoc6mr
egneoit,"I just watched this movie 2 hours ago in 3D. It is by far one of the best action movies I have seen. The beginning of the movie was quite mysterious and action packed then the middle of the movie slowed down a bit and was a bit predictable but then the movie had more twists and action at the end. Overall, it had me guessing and I couldn't predict the end and the way it ended was great.. So good that I didn't know it was ending. I just wished they put someone else besides Christoph Waltz because he kept reminding me of Inglorious Basterds because he had such a memorable role in that movie. ",aoc6mr

egs8q5c,I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it (except that James Cameroon produced it).

I was a bit skeptical of the main character's big eyes from the trailers, but I fell in love with Alita during the course of the projection.

eie5qvv,"I *liked it*. 

Alita and Christoph Waltz' character are the glue that hold the movie together. Alita herself is super charming and endearing. The action is pretty great, the world is intriguing. 

However, there are some weakness, and I think the script needed another pass; 

Hugo .. is just awful. Genuinely a terrible love interest, and a black hole where charisma can be. I was thankful he died (and I assume that because a sequel is unlikely, he's going to stay dead and not get the Bucky Barnes treatment). The fact that he's so present in the movie actually knocks it down a full point in my book. 

The script does sort of have two or three climaxes which could've been rolled together. Toward the end I did sort of feel ""alright, let's just get it over with"". 

There's some character stuff and plotting that's a bit iffy; namely, Jennifer Connelly's character frequently just pops up in scenes, sometimes with some character justification (she's keeping eyes on the hunt for Alita), but, it's usually shot in a way where .. ""Oh, she's just here now"", no proper entrance. Furthermore, I feel Waltz' character is missing a moment where he really comes to terms emotionally with allowing Alita to be her own person and a warrior (namely when he's just suddenly okay with her joining motorball; it feels like there's a scene missing where she tells him she's going to, but, perhaps it'd be too redundant) and Hugo is missing a proper moment where he develops remorse over betraying Alita. As it is, he *says* he loves her and that's why he stopped scrapping robots .. but that event also occurs right after she's signed up for (and in the process of participating in) motorball where she's trying to win money for him. So, his turn rings a little hollow or self-serving.

Also, one smaller one with Alita is her going to the bar to confront the bounty hunters. At that point in time she's fought Grewishka once already, and nearly defeated him (save for his last minute escape). It doesn't *really* make sense for her to pursue help, given how headstrong she is. If she had known he had a new upgrade, it'd make more sense, or if he had easily defeated her before (as he ends up that time). But, the film uses 'he's not the contract list' as a reason for her to seek help from the bounty hunters and it just doesn't track for me. 

As an aside, as someone who hasn't read the source material, I was absolutely shocked that Waltz didn't get killed off after the first act. I thought *for sure* it would be a death-of-the-mentor moment that motivates her. 

Overall though, pretty good. Would like to see a sequel, especially to get more of those flash-backs, but, I think the combination of soft-box office, reviews and the Disney/Fox merger means it's likely to get lost in the many IPs. ",aoc6mr

Only disappointment for me is that I didn't know the end would be so open ended. It was like a happier version of the end of Infinity War. Obvious part 1 of a multipart series, which is fine, but I'd feel a lot better about this if they were already filming the next one.",aoc6mr

All I can say is this, and it is my only real critique, but the main love interest boy was not the best casting choice. Maybe he is a good actor, I don't know, but the dialogue of his character was often pretty meh and the love interest felt a bit rushed.

The Rollerball sequences were great. so were the action sequences.

Loved the going for broke design of the cyborgs. Dude was a car with a face!

Storywise, Act III is in the never-gonna-happen sequel.  The villains we do get are just gloried henchpeople played by great actors wasted (I feel like many of their scenes got cut). The dialog was pretty bad, often overy exposition; Alitas line readings often felt they were edited into from elsewhere.

Despite the negatives above, I had a good time as it played and was wowed visually enough to recommend seeing as big and loud as one can.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the movie itself, but with the 3D technology. Does anyone else also feel that while there certainly is depth, sometimes it feels like 2D layers?

egksc48,"Just got back, and I'm not really sure how I feel about it. I'm definitely not feeling extremely negative or positive, I'm just not sure if I kinda liked it or kinda didn't.

I've heard a lot of people say they think this is the best anime/manga adaptation ever made in the west, and I think that might have given me unrealistic expectations. I kind of went in expecting it to be a shot for shot remake of the manga, and ultimately it was not that. It does cover more or less the same material as the first couple volumes, but the order of things is kind of scrambled. Some characters' motivations are changed, not necessarily in a bad way, but personally I felt in a way that made them less interesting.

I guess that's kind of how I feel about the whole thing. It's a decent adaptation, but I felt like it just didn't reach the same heights as the manga. Not necessarily because they changed things, but I suppose more because they left some things out. As usual with Hollywood, I felt like they were afraid to get ""too weird,"" although this movie already does get more weird than I would have expected. There's some really *wild* shit from the manga that they just straight up didn't do. I don't want to be that guy and demand that everything be exactly the same as the manga, so I think overall I'm most disappointed that they missed out on the absolutely insane spectacle that they could have had. The fight scenes they did have were decently shot and well animated, but their manga counterparts were so much crazier.

Maybe I'm being too hard on it. It definitely wasn't so much of a departure from the source material that I'm *mad*, so there's that. I do kind of feel like it's going to fall flat in the grand scheme of things if they don't do a sequel, however. For all the departures from the manga, I am glad they ended more or less where that particular chapter ended, so they could theoretically pick things up without too many holes to fill in.",aoc6mr

egn28hz,"This is a very complex film to review. While I enjoyed the film overall, it has some serious problems. This review will contain some spoilers.

&#x200B;

First of all, what's great about this film:

* Props to Rosa Salazar for holding this film together. That credit is shared with her animators, as we never really see Rosa. Alita is a motion-captured character, and Salazar's movements and voice acting bring the character to life.
* The action sequences are flat-out AMAZING. The trailer promises some pretty intense action in this movie, and the film delivers on that promise.
* The basic story of the film is really great. I'm not familiar with the manga, but there's a really great premise here. I expect to see it fleshed out in at least one sequel.

The not-so-great:

* Some of the story points are a head-scratcher. E.g., Alita is 300 years old, but Dyson is treating her like an immature teenager. Dyson knows exactly what Alita is but is holding her back for a reason that's never fully explained.
* The bar speech. Just... why? I cringed hard. Thankfully, the ass-kicking that follows makes up for a speech that seems completely out of place in the story.
* Christoph Waltz delivers his lines and then stands there like he's waiting for the director to yell, ""Cut!"" Plus we're supposed to believe that this old guy is moonlighting as a bounty hunter (which seemed totally unbelievable in this make-believe world).
* Jennifer Connolly is so lost in this material. She never really connects with her character, and ruins almost every scene she's in.
* There's a general stiltedness about many scenes that's hard to describe. It's clear that the director understands this, too, because those are the scenes where he TURNS THE EMOTIVE MUSIC UP REALLY LOUD. I mean, it's bleeding obvious that the editor is trying to create the mood with music when the actors and the dialogue aren't delivering it.

There's script problems, there's dialogue problems, there's relationship problems. Look, every movie has problems. But if you like the movie overall, you're willing to overlook those problems. I liked the movie.

I would give this film a 6/10. People already know if they're into this sort of movie, and if they're not, well, this isn't the movie to win them over. Definitely go see it if you thought the trailer was awesome.",aoc6mr
egn4ru1,"I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THIS MOVIE.

Ok, anyways. James Camera did a thing where he pulled stuff from the anime in a way that made sense - probably because anything that felt weird was made not-weird by the fact that the entire movie was filled with weird-looking androids with big eyes like Alita's. 

I think he stuck with the big eyes to keep the unrealism of Anime so that when the 50 different scenes that happened that felt like ""oh man this would make so much sense if this were in an anime"", the big eyes were there to distract you so that those scenes felt normal. I think it just happened to be that it was related to the big eyes you see on Anime characters, and it was a neat little bit of irony that James Cameron chose THAT as a tool to keep the amazing structure that was Alita: Battle Angel together.

Didn't look like it. 

They portrayed the URM as bad guys throughout the movie. But I mean comon. That bad guy Nova. Really? 300 years ago and he's had plenty if time to twist history and he has absolutely no scruples dismembering people for experiments. I think the URM were good guys

The story itself was pretty good. There were times where I felt the film was really silly moments or had corny dialogue and it did feel a little long in the middle of the movie, could have probably been 10-15 minutes shorter in my opinion.

I really liked the world building in this film. When films that are trying to start a franchise world build, I feel at times it can be confusing or very forced in the movie. I think this movie did a really good job of explaining everything to the audience. The film also had fantastic action scenes and the visuals were great.

The performances from Mahershala, Kristopher Waltz, and Jennifer Connelly were also excellent. The visuals and action scenes were very vibrant and exciting as well. Overall I'd give it a 7.5 or 8/10.

The movie is, I would say, a reinterpretation of the story rather than a retelling. It is not a very accurate adaptation. However, I still enjoyed the movie on its own merits. The fight scenes were especially good. Even with my poor memory of the original though, I could recall that there was not near as much romance in the books and I would say that was for the better because it felt like a lot of time was wasted on the romance stuff in the movie. It's still a fine movie though, I'd say it's worth watching at least.",aoc6mr
egtocz9,"First post on Reddit by the way, please take it easy on me...  
To start off, I absolutely hated the trailers; couldn't stand them one bit. They were cringe and straight up annoying. If there was a single most hateful thing about this entire movie, it had to be the damn trailers. The only positive effect they had on me was that they set my expectations to such an abysmal low, the movie ended up absolutely fantastic. Also hope that I'm not the only one that desperately/hopefully wants to see this at some point as a Japanese dub with subtitles....? Yes, I mean actors dubbed in Japanese and English text below. Am I crazy? There were multiple scenes that felt very close to the original OVA of the early 90's. It was a nostalgic trip to the past and I enjoyed it quite a bit with more than one tea... \*cough\* I mean sand in eye moments.  


Few negatives though; despite still wanting to see it again in 3D and also IMAX so 2 more times. Yes that's how much I liked this and feel the need to support the box office for a sequel.  
Once again this is just my personal nitpicking, sorry in advance:

I felt that Galley (Alita) and Hugo appeared somewhat older(taller) than they should have been at this point in the story. This in turn made the romance lines and her gullibility more cheesy than they had to be. Yes I know she lost her memories and she was supposed to represent the ""born yesterday"" fifth element type character. Which I think she performed well, but it could have been a touch better. Also a younger female character would have been even more bad ass when she ends up fighting much bigger/older cyborgs. (Am I taking this too far?)  
The eyes were a bit of a huge turn off, at first but after a few dozen minutes or so you get used to them and they immerse really well. In a way it allowed me to connect to the feelings of the actor much better. (is this a negative? yes because they were ginormous)  
Besides some minor >!healing effect!< I didn't feel the >!body swap made any difference with her strength. There should have been a tiny amount of emphasis of the first one couldn't keep up with capabilities!< besides just that one scene.  
I might have missed this but, the whole part about >!don't go out at night and people going missing!<. I felt they didn't exactly explain why that one villain was such a bad guy. When in the manga >!it's pretty gruesome and obvious why he should not be allowed to stick around!<. Maybe that's why they left it out or skimmed over that detail. Hopefully it will be in some kind of directors cut.  


That's pretty much it for my nitpicking... Okay last one, I swear. What's the deal with the critics? Why do they synchro swimmingly bash eastern based content so damn much? At some point I respected Rotten Tomatoes but lately it's turning in to corporate interest galore; as of right now %59 critics to %93 audience? The other sites are using some kind of electoral college math when it comes to user reviews. All of these sites need to do some soul searching as they are losing touch with their field of profession as well as their credibility.",aoc6mr

Why wasn't Alita more upset that Hugo basically set her up to try out for motorball and almost got her killed? She seemed more upset that he ""murdered"" someone which he didn't do.

eh0ixdz,"First time ever watching a cyberpunk film but I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. I didn't feel like the romance was over done or any of the characters and had funny scenes that didn't feel forced. It felt refreshing this film. I watched a lot of movies, usually superheroes, comedy, action, and of all the films I've seen they all fit the same 'layout', you know what's gonna happen, how it's going to end, where you currently are in the film (beginning, suspense, peak, etc) While for Alita, I was getting surprised every single during the film. The pacing was great, not too long didn't feel like I was just staring at some graphics; I just completely lost track of time watching it. But more, it was like when you play a video game and the tutorial is simply mind-blowing and you need a few seconds to regroup before you do continue with the tutorial. Not to mention the animations were one of the best aspect. I like the way it ended, it can either just be a stand-alone film or be followed with a sequel or even made into a trilogy! Guess we will see!",aoc6mr
eh3uewi,"Saw it yesterday and honestly really freaking liked it. Now it isn't perfect, like Vector is too underdeveloped. There's essentially no proper climax (the mech fight honestly felt like the beginning of the climax and the confrontation with Vector felt like the end, it's like the entire middle of the climax missing, making the ending feel rushed). Also, they do pile a bit too much on in terms of catching people to speed about the world (the first 15 minutes did almost feel like information overload), but it isn't awful. 

However, even with those issues, the rest of the movie I liked. The effects are stunning, you can definitely see the money and effort on screen. I honestly liked the romance, a bit sappy sure, but the two really had good chemistry and were very likeable. Speaking of which, I thought Hugo was fine, the actor plays the role very well and I thought he had enough character to care about. And of course Alita herself is fantastic, not only does she have a very enjoyable journey with good development, but she really is the heart of the movie. Even with the action and the crapsack world, this is a legitimately sweet and heartfelt movie, Alita's relationship with Ido is very sweet (even adorable at times) and, as I said, her relationship with Hugo was very likeable and charming. These relationships just help develop the characters well enough to care for and keep the film from being a mindless action fest. 

However, the action is fantastic, these are some of the best action scenes I've seen in awhile; intense, fast paced, great effects, excellently filmed, and just all around exciting. I also love how much this pushed the PG-13, I was afraid that taking this gory manga and making it PG-13 would be a flaw, but team were able to work around it and give us some pretty disturbing and grisly images, so bravo guys. 

All in all, Alita Battle Angel is a great movie, it's flawed, but it's clearly made by fans who love this manga who are passionate enough to make it reality, plus are talented enough filmmakers to make it a damn good movie on its own. If we can get more anime/manga adaptations like this, with proper respect for the source material done by good filmmakers, then we'd get more good ones. I do hope we get an extended cut on Blu-ray to iron out some kinks, but even if we don't I still think it's a good movie.

Some pros:
- Rosa Salazar did a great job with Alita and the CGI was good too. Really had a few moments where I forgot I was looking at a big-eyed CGI character. 
- The battles were amazing, especially considering it was PG-13. 
- Motorball is really cool. 
- There are so many things I want to know more about in the world of Alita. 

Some cons:
- Hugo actor was atrocious and so was his buddy that got sliced in half Darth Maul style (btw, if I saw my best bro get sliced in half, I’d be fucking screaming/crying lol). 
- While the actor was bad for Hugo, some of the dialogue was taken straight out of a Disney TV movie. Just really awful and cringey stuff. Amazing actors like Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali couldn’t even overcome it. It’s crazy how hard they work on the battle scenes and then see how comparatively bad the dialogue is. 
- Alita suffered from Superman syndrome a few times in the movie. Really felt like she was indestructible at times. Obviously the anime has something to do with this too.",aoc6mr
egczu6m,"Saw it in Vmax 3D at a preview event last Sunday and really enjoyed it. 

The visuals and world building is great, while the dialogue can be pretty exposition heavy at times, but the real stand out is Alita as a fully fledged character. Definitely worth seeing on a big screen.

egs8l2x,"I’m really wondering where the marketing is for this movie. Why aren’t Rosa Salazar and Robert Rodriguez and Christoph Waltz and James Cameron out on the talk circuit?

But anyway, I saw it yesterday. Sometimes, I forgot Alita was Serkis Folk. As much as we all panned the big eyes, they’re not that distracting and add to the idea of her as being a girl out of place.

Salazar’s performance is wonderful, especially considering that she has to do things like the mirror scene, like the action with this suit and rig on her. There are few slouches among this cast.

But going back to the action, this movie was lacking in big fights. Rarely did we see the full potential of the URM suit on display. 

I think my larger problem with the movie is it introduces so much that it takes a while to tie everything up. It was as if there were 20 separate climaxes because oh wait we gotta take care of this, this and this.

It’s by far the best anime/manga adaptation made in the west (not like that’s much of a competition), and the love put into it is obvious. I wonder though, with the ending as sequelbaiting as it was, will Disney see the numbers to allow Cameron and Landau and Rodriguez do it again?",aoc6mr

Her relationship was supposed to lack chemistry and actually be toxic (it’s worse in the manga as he’s basically an asshole and it’s one sided). If anything the relationship isn’t something you’re supposed to root for, it’s supposed to highlight Alitas lack of interpersonal skills to have a healthy relationship. This is something she ends up developing. (Mind you, shes also mentally a teenager here)

The only issue is the studio executives tried marketing this as a love story when the romantic relationship was supposed to be one sided and toxic but essential for Alita to know to how to develop better relationships with other human beings.",aoc6mr

Pros:

- Alita is a solid MC, being both badass and adorable

I'm _soooooooooooooooo_ glad that they took into account the fact that someone would move differently if they had the strength to pick up and throw a car and the accuracy of a legit android superhuman. The precise and controlled movements of Alita were spot-on to how I would imagine them, and I'm so happy they did that.",aoc6mr
egp1nw4,"For me, the problem with Hugo wasn't so much the guy as the way they handled him. I have no doubt James Cameron could have written a more believable romance if he wanted (this the Titanic guy for fuck's sake!), but that wasn't was he was going for, because his storyline was filled with twists that I suppose were kinda necessary for his presence to make sense.

First, he seems like some random cliche love crush of Alita. I think that's what they were going for, it feels dumb, but I would have been okay with that... If it wasn't because Alita seems to get absolutely obsessed with him and he doesn't really do much for her. He's just a handsome annoying dude. 

Then, we learn that he's a cyborg jacker, and the audience is supposed to learn that something is wrong with their relationship. Alita gets even more obsessed and all those scenes (particularly the heart scene) *are* supposed to be as cringe-worthy as they felt. We know he spoke with Vector and we suspect that he told him something about wanting him to get Alita. When he makes her close her eyes and kisses her, it's not very romantic because we get the feeling that he could bring out a knife and stab her at any point. We distrust Hugo, and seeing her flail her arms in the motorbike is weird as hell and I'm sure the filmmakers meant it for us to feel that way.

And then we learn... That Hugo was good all along. But by the point this happens, we already heavily distrust the guy. He's been acting weird the whole movie, he hid his cyborg-jacker persona to her, he talks with the bad guys... So when we're finally convinced that he's a good guy, it feels unearned. We're unable to empathize with him or how Alita feels about him. The romance happens in a moment and there's nothing that separates him from any other character.

By the end of the movie he's, in my mind, like 75% bad guy and if he was going to gain our trust back he really needed to redeem himself. But he never does, he just gets himself (and Alita) in danger and almost killed. And then after that he gets killed.

That's why I think he was such a bad character, and I'm glad they got rid of him. I'm sure the sequels will have Alita getting angry over his death, and that'll feel better because at least we'll only have Alita's perception of him, and not the perception we got from the movie.",aoc6mr

egne9hw,"This is the best anime adaptation to date, and while that might not be big praise considering the competition in that field. I do feel like Rodriguez has accomplished something pretty great here. It is true to the source mateiral both in the story and look and feel. IMO the BIGGEST part of making an anime adaptation successful is to *ACTUALLY* use the art style presented. That stuff is iconic and is usually a big part of the actual world building. People like to use that meme of ""The Manga>the Anime>The Netflix adaptation"" and it's 100% true. This desire of western adaptations to completely throw out the actual art style is terrible, and it makes it feel generic. IMO this movie at least looks and feels like its own thing. 

I really loved this movie. I thought Rosa Salazar was great as Alita herself. The corny early scenes of her discovering stuff was really well done, and *extremely* charming to me. The overall plot has a good direction and a great collection of fun and interesting characters. I'll also say it was funny watching people get so visibly angry at the dog being killed. This movie also felt PG-13 to me. Sure they made all the blood blue but it still had this cool dingy violent quality to it that really reminded me of an 80s film in the best way. Stuff like Alita slicing that guys face off was such a Rodriguez moment and done so fucking well. 

I hope this film ends up doing well. I honestly feel like it will be the foreign markets that decide its fate. ",aoc6mr
ehni423,"I kept vacillating between really digging it and getting pissed at it. The eye candy was fun. I actually thought Alita was interesting looking. The big eyes were surprislingly kind of cool. Plenty of pretty set design and character details. I liked often the interactions between Alita and Ido. At times it was pleasant to see her sticking up for herself and being a badass.

However, the movie really suffered from a lack of focus. Yeah, they had a ton of material to cover, but why rush to cram so much in? Do we really need hero vs parent, hero vs goons, hero vs socioeconomic system, hero vs bigbadboss, hero + love interest, hero vs competitive sports world, hero + memory loss, hero + war, hero vs trappings of youth. I mean, let's pick a few and concentrate on them. The movie would have been better for it. 

Additionally, the  ""born sexy yesterday""  trope coming on strong at times, and the sexualizing of her naivete paired with infantilization- it grew tiresome, imo.  Then we have a love interest who sucked, and a gratuitous gaze of the camera sliding over her body. ( It may be a machine body, but she still wears clothes) and given she is presented as young and childlike, I found it disturbing how often the camera lazily explored her visually, with characters even commenting on her appearance after the upgrade. 

Additionally, other female characters were woefully underused (the nurse barely says a peep the whole movie!). Chirin had so much potential that was wasted. It ends up being a movie with a childlike hero who I want to like and root for, but she just ends up surrounded by men who either want to patronize her, flirt with her, betray her, or torture her. I mean, she's so badass at times, but then next she's literally taking out her heart for someone. It was moments like that which would instantly make me lose respect for her. 

In the end, it felt like a great, fun CG popcorn movie, but one that was written by a gaggle of horny high school boys who didn't exactly excel in their creative writing class. On the surface enjoyable, but I had to turn off a lot of my critical thinking in the process to get there. ",aoc6mr

The love story feels like when you put truffle oil too much on the dish, it left a lingering unpleasant taste after that. Plus it does not help the boy is the weakest link of the movie. I also the movie feels like a pilot episode, some set ups that do not have satisfying payoff. It is not as bad as the Mummy or The Amazing Spider-man 2 but it still bothers me.

But the special effects were great, especially when rollerblading and when they got ambushed by some cyborg, it feels like a well done PG-13 body horror. Rosa Salazar is believable and charismatic as lead hopefully, she'll get more lead role in future

In the end, it depends on your expectation, if you're expecting a spectacle, you're going to like the movie.

I personally give this movie 6 out of 10.",aoc6mr
egnhc0d,"I am glad that this movie exists, and I enjoyed watching it, even though I didn't think it was particularly good. There is plenty to like here though - the CGI characters are wonderfully realized, and the action sequences had me in awe. The production design is really strange and so unabashedly goofy that it is very charming. And the movie finds space in its crowded story for small, humanizing character moments. For example, the movie takes its time showing Alita's experience of waking up for the first time and getting used to her limbs. Or how Dr. Ido places a glass right-side up when he enters in the bar fight scene. Between the obviously impressive set pieces, small moments like those hint that this movie had potential to be a bit more than spectacle. It's unfortunate that it doesn't really capitalize on it.

The central problem is the meandering and disjointed plot structure. It is so obvious that this movie is trying to condense down a lot of material from another source. Scenes just happen without proper setup and characters just do things without proper motivation. The big motorball sequence is a prime example of this. The scene establishes this tense scenario where Alita is facing off against a crew of dangerous opponents. She finds out its a set up just before it starts, but participates anyways. But why? At this point in the story she doesn't have a good reason to compete, it just got suggested by Hugo in the previous scene as a way to make money. This sequence that feels like the big climactic action sequence of the whole movie, but it feels like it is happening for almost no reason. This motorball sequence shifts into a totally different sequence and doesn't return to the motorball game, furthering the feeling that things are happening without sufficient justification.

The movie kinda feels like short vignettes strung together, likely a result of the manga source material its based on. Like, now let's have an alley fight, now let's explore a spaceship, now let's have a bar fight, etc. That might have worked, but it still needed a consistent thrust to the plot. Our protagonists do not want a single, consistent thing throughout the movie (except Hugo, I'll get to him) so as a result, our protagonists feel very passive in the plot. The villains want Alita, but its not particularly clear why - to get her heart, for some reason? Or her body? Or to just kill her because she's dangerous? Or to get revenge? It's not clear, and that's a problem.

Aside from the movie not flowing well from scene to scene, the characters also really suffer from the disjointed plot. None of the characters feel like they get a complete arc. Ido is good example of this, where there is good conflict setup with his character - >!he is still dealing with the death of his daughter, which affects his relationship with Alita, and leads to him being overprotective!< \- but it isn't satisfactorily resolved. His arc ends like halfway through the movie, when >!he gives Alita her new body after the second fight with Grewishka thus accepting her independent will to be a warrior,!< but it's not really clear why that change occurred in him. And then after that point, the movie don't really have anything left for the character to do. We don't even see him react to the other major events that occur. 

Honestly, even the portrayal was a bit flat, I kind of liked Hugo simply because he had a clear goal that he was actively trying to achieve. He has the most complete arc of any character: >!He wants to move beyond his circumstances to Zalem, and to do so he finds himself doing dirty work for Vector. He is ok with assaulting cyborgs until he falls for Alita, so he tries to change his ways, but it's already too late. He ends up 'dying' for what he's done, and then 'resurrected' in a cyborg body - a fitting end for someone who didn't treat cyborgs well before.!< Unfortunately, when his arc is basically complete, the movie just keeps going. >!Hugo runs off and gets himself killed again and it's bizarre for how unwarranted it feels. It is such an unforced error. It is clearly supposed to be the final big emotional hit to end the movie with, but it falls totally flat.!<

Other characters have their own problems. Alita feels very passive in her own story, and she doesn't have a clear motivation until near the end of the movie. The motivations of Vector and Grewishka and Zapan are seriously lacking, as mentioned. Chiren's story of redemption definitely got cut apart somewhere in editing. And why was Dr. Ido's assistant even in this movie? She did literally nothing.

Now I'm sure the presence of all these faulty elements and incomplete plot threads make sense if you are familiar with the source material, but that doesn't really matter. An adaptation should know how to alter the story to make it better fit the medium.

Still, despite the flaws, I would still recommend this movie to anyone even a little bit interested. It is strange and silly and charming and very visually impressive. It was a refreshing movie just because it felt different than almost anything else I've seen recently. I'll be surprised if the sequel it sets up comes to be, but if it does I'll go see that opening weekend too.",aoc6mr
eibk21d,"10/10 easily for me. I loved the movie so much that I've watched it twice now. It's also my favorite up to date which is saying something but I just feel that it's well deserved. The entire execution of the film itself was beautiful, seamless and well rounded overall. It is its own while remaining self aware and unique at heart. The performances, plot, action, and animation were top notch too that it pains me that the movie wasn't as big as it should've been domestically.",aoc6mr
ejn201o,"It just creeped me out a bit how much so many grown men latched onto it, and how it was pitted against captain marvel. Come to think of it it was creepy how she's a kid but then she grows boobs in the second half (and you see her naked - okay sure she's a robot but then why is she wearing clothes later on if she's not naked?). I think it's a movie that was intended for young girls, and  that's cool, but the fact that it's getting a cult following amongst anti-SJW men is not a good look. It's very ""born sexy yesterday"", so that makes sense.

&#x200B;

Dramas aside, I think that it is very visually stunning, and I  liked that cocky robot (I think his name is Zapan?) but literally every other character is boring as hell, even Alita. Alita is only interesting when she's fighting because the fighting sequences are so well done, but as a person she is a total Mary Sue (a phrase I don't use very often). People are saying the movie has heart but tbh I fail to see anything unique, other than the special effects. The rollerball game was not clear to me at all (are they rollerskating or playing football? both? what are the rules?). I'm not sorry that I saw the film but I am disappointed that they splashed all that money and CGI onto what should've been far better. ",aoc6mr
eu7jbct,"I'm surprised people like this movie. The tonal inconsistencies are jarring. Half the characters are cartoony looking like Alita, Nova, the cowboy with the dogs, the rollerball characters . . . also the teeny bopper love interest, the cute little dog . . . but then on the other hand you have people being cut into pieces, impaled, beheaded, the gnarly looking backalley murderers . . .

The story goes all over the place like im playing an RPG and ive started a dozen side quests while still dont knowing what the main quest is.

I dont even know why those people want to leave the surface city, its colorful, people look healthy, happy, right outside the gates you have beautiful nature . . .

And i mean the way it ended . . . is this supposed to be a pilot for a tv show?

And i see people praising the CGI, which i also find surprising. I felt that the CGI was hit or miss, especially alita herself, whose body proportions i felt were inconsistent from scene to scene.",aoc6mr

eglw5ef,"So a little bit of backstory: my old account that I’ve had for years  got suspended about 2 months ago.Unfortunately I no longer have access to the email I made it with so I’m pretty much locked out for good. This whole time its been suspended, I’ve been using reddit with it still, unable to upvote or comment. Just because I wasn’t ready to let it go.

I just made a new account just so I can say how much I love Alita Battle Angel.

It was honestly everything I was looking for in a blockbuster. The special effects were stunning, but more importantly every action scene they accompanied was breathtaking. I especially loved the motorball scene, so fucking badass. The world building was really solid, pacing felt perfect, it didnt feel its length at all and at the end I was genuinely sad I wasn’t going to get more. I also loved her character design that reddit was bashing, she was the perfect amount of different/weird while still being adorable. The reason for why she looks a little differnt made total sense too [ I would imagine a sentient cyborg weapon from mars would look a little weird](#spoiler).

I went in expecting cool special effects and a weak story that held it back, but I honestly loved the story. Her growth as a character as she learns more about the world around her was perfect. I loved Christoph Waltz in this, I loved the bit in the middle where Alita suspects he may be [a serial killer](#spoiler) because I know Wazltz could play that kind of character. All the bounty hunter stuff was amazing, I loved how badass and unique they all were, and [ Christoph Waltz running around with fucking Reinhardt’s hammer](#spoiler) was hilarious and again the perfect amount of weird for me. The villains were great, Ali was a fucking mint crime lord and [the way they made it clear that he was insignificant in this world](#spoiler) was really intriguing. His acting in the scenes when [ Nova took over his body was awesome IMO and I especially loved his death scene](#spoiler). The lower tier villains were also great and served as perfect obstacles for her to overcome. My entire theater was cheering after [“fuck your mercy](#spoiler).

Lastly, the “weakest” part of the movie, the love story. I thought it was totally fine and actually pretty cute, sue me. It’s no Before Midnight, but it felt really organic and earned to me. The love interest’s actor wasn’t the best but at no point was he distracting. I really enjoyed how he was a little layered and there is a bit of intrigue as to what his motivations are. But as an audience member, I could understand why she would fall in love with him and I could understand why he would fall in love with here. That’s all I really need in a love story. I also loved the whole [take me heart](#spoiler) scene, it was cheesy, weird and hilarious in all the right ways.

So time for my wall of text to come to an end. Honestly as much as I am writing this because I just want to share how much I enjoyed this movie so that other might enjoy it too, I have ulterior motives. I desperately want to see the sequel to this movie and I don’t want it to end up like Dredd, where it fails financially despite being a great movie. And I am doomed to be forever waiting for a sequel that will never come.

TLDR- If you are sick of all the blockbusters being superheroes and sequels and you dont give Alita a chance, then you are a part of the problem. Its’s fun, engaging, beautiful and full of heart.

That was genuinely the best theater experience I’ve had since Fury Road, I cant recommend it enough.


Edit. As if I hadn’t typed enough I thought of one more thing to rave about in this movie. The soundtrack was fucking awesome. I heard Junkie XL toss a bit of the Mad Max soundtrack in there during the first motorball scene and that just made my heart incredibly happy.",aoc6mr

egowh8p,"It's interesting to read the comments here and parse thru all the criticism of Hugo and how useless and lame he is throughout the movie. 

I agree with the criticism btw. He was wack as fuck.

His character is just a gender flipped damsel in distress. He adds nothing to the plot and exists only to be saved by Alita over and over, and to create stakes for the audience because Alita is more or less invincible and he isn't. 

I don't know for sure, but my theory is that this character would be facing less criticism had the movie had more traditional gender roles and it had been a woman needing to be saved constantly by a man.",aoc6mr

egg6ezg,"I couldn't say I *liked* it, but as someone who read (and really loved) the original manga they did some interesting things with the story elements they were given. It's not always successful, but they managed to reasonably streamline the clusterfucky story by combining most of the first arcs of the first tomes. 

Some elements lose a bit of their meaning, like Grewishka/Makaku who was completely mad and really more interesting in the manga, but I doubt they could have done him justice in a two hours-long movie while keeping the Hugo/Zapan/Vector storylines. Overall it's an interesting and serious effort.

That being said, the adaptation work doesn't really save the movie from its own flaws. The writing of the love story with Hugo was really cringey - which is a damn shame because Hugo is interesting, once his own story really starts off. There are *loads* of exposition in the beginning, and that doesn't leave a lot of time for Alita to develop an interesting personality. And as much as I was pleasantly surprised by the adaptation work, I believe they should have kept Nova for later (if there is a ""later"", that is), because he quickly overshadows Vector, makes him less threatening, less interesting, and makes his final defeat less satisfying. 

Overall the movie needed more time to make the relationship between Hugo and Alita interesting, and to develop Alita's personality. I think they could have saved time by scrapping Nova, and some Motorball scenes.

Can't say I wouldn't watch the sequel if they end up making it, though. I'm under the impression that it would be more focused and effective, and the Motorball arc of the manga is great (even though its genius resides partially in the fact that >!Alita loses at the end!<). Ah and for the record, I hated Alita's CGI alien face, but hey YMMV.",aoc6mr

I want to dive deeper into the expansive world that was introduced in this movie; I want to visit Zalem and learn more about URM. Anyhow, I have a question: Why does Alita have a new body at the very end of the movie (i.e. one other than the URM body that she finds in a ship that's submerged in a body of water)? Is it indeed the URM body but has a different appearance due to its nano-molecular structure changing in order to reflect a new subconscious self-image that Alita has gained of her self?",aoc6mr
egi58h4,Some of the edits and cuts were really weird in this movie.,aoc6mr
egiawjg,"1. I loved the visuals. The movie was a spectacle; I saw it in IMAX 3D and I haven't been that immersed in a film's world in a long time. Alita was a lot more visually believable than I anticipated. After the first five minutes or so I was sold on her performance. 3D was actually incredible. 

2. Alita's character was actually likable and I loved every second that she was on screen. BUT. Oh my god the boyfriend character. I was literally cheering both times he died. What an awful casting decision. He felt completely vapid and the romance felt so contrived I wanted to vomit. The kissing scene where Alita tells him that she has upgraded physical feeling with her new suit :nauseated\_face: 

3. So many cringey lines. I laughed out loud when the dog guy goes. ""He didn't like dogs. I don't like that."" So so so many unintentionally hilarious one-liners. Yikes. The dialogue, especially towards the beginning of the film, felt like something from an amateur film class and I was actually shocked that some of these conversations made it in. 

4. I love the casting for the doctor and his jet hammer is epic. 

5. THE CLIFFHANGER ENDING. So frustrating. As someone who hasn't read the manga I though they could have ended it with a quick trip to the city up top and have Alita kill the bad guy; the last scene could be Alita cutting off the main bad guy's head in one epic swipe. 

6. Some random character motivation changes felt really forced. Ex: when Alita gives her random speech about 'good and evil' in the bar i was like WTF is this even the same character? Her motives and capabilities didn't always feel consistant or logical. 

7. This movie made me think a lot about how our society spends millions and millions to keep us entertained with blockbuster films while homeless people starve and we don't invest in making the world a better place for everyone. Like, I walked out with mild existential angst that we might actually live in a dystopia. 

&#x200B;

Overall I got what I wanted from the film, but with better dialogue and a better romance I think this movie could have been actually great. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief a lot, but not for that crappy romance. That romance is easily my biggest gripe with this film. I haven't wanted a character to die this much since BingBong in Inside Out.

Edward Norton was miscast as Nova. He doesn't look like him at all. Why not use performance capture on other characters as well? And I didn't like that he could take over others and monitor the whole city. And he is supposed to be an outcast too, not running the city.

The cyborgs and hunters looked too human, and the villains and rollerball competitors not dangerous enough. There is no way Hugo and his friends could have taken down one of the champions on their own.

They killed the dog. In the comics he survives. 

She got her memories back too early.   
The movie was less graphic than the comic, but since it needs money to be a success, I can understand why they did it.

&#x200B;

The good things:   
They skipped the spinal column thing and the werewolf stuff (for the lack of a better word).

One disappointing thing was Hugo, completely miscast (he has much darker tones in the book, and here it’s just an average good looking teenager with no tension). One unforgivable thing for me is the Final Fantasisation of the universe. Gunmm is a dark world, often at night, and they made it a city you almost wish to spend time in. One really striking creative choice was also the border of the city, with fairly green and colourful countryside. Gunmm is Mad Max level dystopian, not lollipop cyberpunk. ",aoc6mr

I recommend seeing it in 3D. The wide shots showing the city and all the parts where stuff ""comes at the screen"" really shine when you can actually see depth. I even jumped at least twice as a reaction of something ""flying"" at me.

Yes, the story & writing had some flaws. Lots of them, in fact. But they aren't enough to ruin the movie. Some of the flaws *could* be explained by the *intentional* leaving of story/information out, just to bring mystery or allow for a sequel to explain more. Or even the weird stuff that Alita did could be explained by her amnesia or some hidden programming that she isn't aware of (again, her motivations could be explained in a sequel or just left to mystery, with the assumption that it simply had something to do with her former life). Plus, everything else that was going on made up for the ""gaps"" in the story. You won't sit there and ask ""**why** did she just *do that*?"", you'll sit there and ask ""**holy shit**, did you just *see that*?"".


It's at 60% on RT. I'd say some critics are too tough on it. If you're just going to analyze on writing & plot merit, alone, then yeah, maybe a 65% - 70% movie. I get it. Many critics went *hard* against the ""gaps"" in writing. That's their job.

If you can overlook the gaps in the writing issues (which, again, all *might be intentional*), it's easily an 80%. And for entertainment value, it's definitely closer to a 95%.

I had high hopes for this film ever since it was announced and knew James Cameron was tied to the production. I was NOT disappointed! For the best experience, I highly suggest seeing it in IMAX 3D as it'll better immerse you into the world and characters.

I think they did a great job at setting up the story. Beginning with Alita's mysterious past and then throughout the movie unlocking her character and history. I enjoyed the father daughter relationship between Alita and Christoph Waltz character, Dr. Ido. And the love interest between Alita and Hugo seemed natural, and not forced. Rosa Salazar, the actress behind Alita (along with digital artists at WETA Digital) did an amazing job at bringing the CGI character to life. I never got an ""uncanny valley"" feeling from Alita (despite her manga inspired facial aesthetic). It's probably some of the best special effects in film thus far.

Speaking of special effects...from crafting the world, to the cyborg side characters, to the action/battle sequences, everything was spectacular. Again, seeing it in IMAX 3D really let's these things shine.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie to any fans of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I hope it does well at the box office too, as they perfectly set everything up for sequels. Such a rich world, characters, etc...would love to see more of it.",aoc6mr

I felt super immersed in this world and was so fascinated by it the whole time. The world building was pretty decent. I found the characters interesting and compelling for the most part. The mystery behind who Alita was kept my interest. The visuals were amazing and the action was very entertaining and will choreographed. It was a lot of fun watching her kick some serious butt. I loved the idea of motor ball. I would watch a motor ball movie by itself. Rosa Salazar gave a pretty good performance as well.

Now I'm going to start with my criticisms by saying my biggest problem. My biggest issue was that the film didn't feel complete. I think they are trying so hard to set up for a sequel but by doing so this movie felt like it was a story that was cut off right before the climax. I also felt like the villain was very underdeveloped. I didn't really know much about his motivation or really anything about him. The dialogue was pretty weak as well

Overall, the film was quite entertaining and I would love to see where the story and characters go from here.

I would also like to see more of the villain and whatever the city in the sky was called. 8/10",aoc6mr

What worked:

\- It's a great visual spectacle. Even though I hate 3D movies, I decided to see it in IMAX 3D and now believe that's the optimal way to experience this film

\- Visually interesting and immersive world design

\- Great character designs. Even Alita's big ass eyes didn't bother me.

\- Rosa Salazar was great

\- Well choreographed fight scenes

\- Roller-derby-murderball is surprisingly fun to watch

\- That Edward Norton cameo at the end got me super hyped... but that's probably just because I love Edward Norton

&#x200B;

What didn't work:

\- The plot was serviceable but pretty damn generic. I'm not familiar with the source material at all, so I don't how faithful this is.

\- Hugo. A bad performance for a pretty one note love interest character. Did not care in the slightest when he died.

\- The pacing was kind of all over the place at times

\- Some inconsistent / wonky character motivations and actions.

\- The third act. Seriously, the movie really fell apart here. Like we go through all that trouble to save Hugo only for Christoph Waltz to call Alita up and be like ""hey, here's some plot information"" and then Hugo dies. What was the narrative purpose in saving him? This all happened at such a comically break neck speed there was no chance for anything to sink in and have any emotional impact.

I saw Spiderverse a few weeks ago as well, and this and that film are just gorgeous to look at.

I was reminded a lot of RoboCop. Not for the subject matter, but the causal disregard for the body. Rodriguez channels Verhoeven and maybe Cronenberg a bit, and while the last 15 minutes are too much, and pretty schmaltzy, I also didn't want to say goodbye to the characters or the world.

Im completely in love with Alita, what an amazing job Rosa Salazar did.",aoc6mr
ehpsm7v,"Best movie I've seen in a long long time. It's a breath of fresh air after all these formulaic action movies lately. No meta-politics, just pure fun and emotion. I left the theater wanting more of that world. I never want it to end.",aoc6mr
eiewrrb," I finally watched it and....


I thought it was just...okay.


Here's my main gripe. 


It felt like I was watching an abridged version of the movie or a cliff's notes of the movie. It felt like things happened in the movie because they HAD to happen and as such a lot of the drama or supposed character building felt unearned. 




1. Alita suddenly falling in love with the first dude she sees happens for no rhyme or reason but it HAD to happen. It's like Dolores dropping a can of food for someone to pick it up.




2. The dog just suddenly getting killed in the bar. Why? What was the point of the dog in the first place??!!  And you know what's even funnier, all the marketing show Alita with the blood on her cheeks. BECAUSE OF A FUCKING DOG DYING!!



3. I groaned and almost chuckled at the random exposition from Ido and Hugo.



4. Alita just suddenly calling Ido her father was cringe inducing. Like, I get he's fixed her and everything, but she's only known him for a few days and suddenly he's ""daddy"". And obviously if he's gonna be the daddy he's gotta be SUPER protective of his little girl giving her rollerblades, kneepads, a helmet and good luck kiss on the forehead.


5. ""It'd give you my heart?!"" What the fuck?? I would have expected that as a meme from im14andthisisdeep, not a Robert Rodriguez directed film. I was never sure who the demographic was for this film. Was it teenagers because of the hack romance and the shitty dialogue like the aforementioned? But they how do you explain people getting fucking murdered?


6. I'm sorry, but I consider the black nurse a visual example of the movie feeling like a cliff's notes version of the manga. It's like someone had a list of characters, but since the movie was so condensed they just slapped the characters there and end up not helping to advance the plot at all. If they had written her off, nothing would have been lost.


7. The fight scenes were good and visually impressive.



8. So Jennifer Connelly's eyes, hands and brains just get put in a vat for no reason. Like, seriously what was the point of that? I'm assuming it's because it was in the manga and that's why they added that part in, but again it adds NOTHING. She just suddenly decides she doesn't want to be a bad guy anymore after realizing the bad guy she sleeps with is actually a....bad guy that...gasp....*lies*...to people.



9. Oh hey let's go to this place we found. Oh look it's a downed space-plane?, Oh golly gee would you look at that it's an MCRN military ship with.....hot tamale a metal body just for you, how convenient!



10. Having not read the manga and don't intend to. There's one inconsistency. If Alita was 300 years old by the time she was found. How was she at the top of the landfill and not buried at the very bottom? With how easily she was found by Ito it makes it look as if she had just recently been ""disposed"" of.


11. During the scene with Ido giving Alita a tour of the neighborhood, If you paid super close attention to the background of the scenes, you'd notice the same 3 or 4 background extras passing by over, and over, and over behind the actors. Once I noticed that, I knew I was gonna be in for....something.



12. The eyes didn't bother me as much as I thought they would.



13. The entire film felt rushed from the moment Edo found Alita in the dumpster.



14. I almost laughed when Hugo kept telling Alita that the city is a dangerous place while we see the background characters laughing, smiling, drinking tea and mostly dressed like American tourists visiting France.",aoc6mr
egdy8ni,Really liked it. Really hoping for sequels,aoc6mr
ege5074,"My feelings for the film lean on the negative side, but something that I definitely appreciated was Alita fully embracing her abilities every time she discovered something new about herself. I've gotten so used to the trope of deadly characters who don't know they're deadly get horrified at their abilities as they discover it. But in Alita, not only does she have no angst about her powers, but she actively seeks out what *more* she can do and immediately tries it out to benefit her and those she cares about. 

Again, I have very mixed feelings about the film overall, but that was my favourite part of the whole movie with the action scenes at a close second.",aoc6mr
egd54ju,I liked the movie. The AMC theater I went to was supposed to be handing out free pop keychains but instead they decided to sell them off for three dollars or if you bought one of their expensive drinks at the bar. Super lame and kinda bummed me out.,aoc6mr
egdfdrx,"I thought the film was a **great adaption,** they really **kept the spirit of the manga and they nailed Alita.**

Holy fuck, **she is the shining star of this film, Salazar killed it**. She was a joy to watch, the initial innocence and how she creeps down the stairs, then the inclination towards violence when she decides to knock out Tanji during street motorball. **They made her so endearing and likable before we get to the warrior side of her. It was such an emotive performance that was the heart of the film.**

**The films is visually and technically stunning**. It has **fleshed out production design that is so detailed and goes hand-in-hand with the VFX**. Iron City is different to the manga but they make it it's own thing and it has so much flavour to it. Small things like the Aztec design on the back of Zapan's body.

**Bill Pope killed it, his lighting is so textured** and the film has **actual thought out cinematography** where the shots/movements flow with the story and character dynamic within a scene. I always get the impression most blockbusters just plop a camera down and don't block out a scene.

**The film is unashamedly anime/manga esque, the action scenes are incredible**, it puts other CG heavy blockbusters to shame. **Also they really pushed that 12A/PG-13 rating, holy fuck.**

Being unashamedly manga it does lead to **cheesy writing but I never felt the writing dropped below something like 'Aquaman'** and I actually found the film to be **quite sincere** in it's cheese at times. **The pacing is rushed when it hits Act 3, it needs a bigger set-piece** **and less teasing of Nova** but **I had no issue with the actual ending itself because it matches her journey in the manga** with a few changes, it's the first part of a large journey for her.

I thought **Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connelly did really good jobs**, **Waltz sold Ido's fatherly side to Alita** and I thought the added backstory gave the story more emotional complexity and depth. I loved watching him having to let Alita go and grow up, I thought it was a wonderful story about daughters growing up and he sold it. **Connelly sold me on her characters turn with her last scene and dialogue**.

**They nailed Zapan, Skrein is just Zapan** and his story plays out exactly the same leaving the door open for the Bezerker arc.

**Mahershala Ali and Keean Johnson are both underwritten in their roles**. **Ali does a great job though** you can see **he's having fun playing two characters** and jumping between them and in terms of the larger story he is a lackey. **I found Johnson likable as Hugo, enough to buy into the romance** but when it got to **the more emotional scenes in the latter half of the film he really struggled** **and Salazar really carried him through those scenes. I wish they kept his backstory.**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: World, Production design, VFX, Action scenes, Rosa Salazar as Alita, Cinematography are all fantastic to me. Waltz, Connelly, Ali, Skrein and the faithfulness to the material are really good. The writing is cheesy (like Aquaman) and anime/manga esque but I found it to be sincere at times. Johnson is weakest part but still likable, needed more depth. Pacing in Act 3 is rushed, needs padding and less Nova set-up.**

Second time I saw the film my rating went up a bit. I was able to enjoy it so much more and the pacing issues in Act 3 didn't bother as much. It's such a fun ride throughout and they handled Alita's journey in this film so well. I hope we get a sequel.

&#x200B;

**8/10**

&#x200B;

Also Edward Norton as Nova!! Solid grab for the casting, I hope we get another one so he gets to shine.

Tanji getting sliced in half was crazy, can't believe they got away with that.

The bar fight and underground fight with Grewishka is everything I wanted. The cockiness of Alita. Zapan's 'This bitch broke my nose' followed by Alita's ""Yes I did"", how she looks down when Ido walks in. One armed Alita fighting is something I never thought they'd translate but they went for it.

Loved the f-bomb ""Fuck your mercy""",aoc6mr

But let me say, the action sequences had me on the edge of my seat. I felt the world I was looking at was so real. 
Sometimes the boy acting was a little cringe but it never took me out the movie. Alita and everything she showed made me feel for her. I didn’t see her as a cyborg and I’m glad the movie showed that. I really hope a second one is made. Go see it and give this movie some money this weekend.",aoc6mr

Though, the acting and love story were manageable when they became so trash they were funny. Half the audience died laughing when Hugo died.

&#x200B;

egogkp8,"I saw this yesterday and gave myself a day to stew it over.

I have to say, as a huge fan of the comics, I was fairly disappointed with some of the characterizations and how the story evolved.

The movie seems to be a fairly faithful adapation of the 1993 Ova (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tofSaLB9kwE)

but it itself invents a character (Chiren) for the purposes of.. something.

Now, I really didn't like that they actively glossed over the ""Secret of Tiphares"". While it doesn't appear until arcs after what was covered in the movie, that some ""hints"" for it such as the ""Mark of Zalem"" that Ido removed were, well, removed, makes me feel somewhat sad. If there is a follow up film, Ido's lack of this mark is going to need to be explained away. How unfortunate.

I did think that that the Secret of Tiphares might play a role. From the start, Alita having a [human brain)]#spoiler) was referenced, while the adults of Zalem/Tiphares [do not, instead they have chips for brains](#spoiler). A big part of the Tiphares arc deals with what it is to be human in a cyborg world. Are you human with [a brain? or with a chip? Does it matter?](#spoiler). I'm spoiler tagging out anything to do with the Secret in case anyone wants to experience it for themselves, because it's truly fucked up.

I was glad that Motorball was a part of the film, but not in the way that it was done. [Motorball isn't really a thing until AFTER Hugo dies, as it's a way for Alita to try and find out who she is and what her purpose is after Hugo's death.](#spoiler) There is a lot of character growth in that arc that was rushed for the sake of the movie. That being said, seeing some familar names was nice, although not seeing Jashugan was unfortunate.

Two characters, though, I felt were butchered. Vector and Nova are both wildly different characters than portrayed. In the movie, it seems to me that both are evil for the sake of it - Vector's business-first ego seems to.. not really exist. It's business, yes, but we've got to do it *personally* in order to show how corrupt and evil we are. Vector plays a big role in the Bar Jack arc, [so having him get killed off is also unfortunate.](#spoiler)

Now Desty Nova's character was absolutely terrible. Not once was Nova's absolute one love discussed. There was a brief chance at the end of the film through the mouth of Vector, but not a single time was the word ""Flan"" brought up or even referenced. I can't get a single goddamn ""Flan is Life"" from this guy? He's seen eating the food in almost every frame he's in for the manga, but not so for the movie.

I think I know why. In the manga, Desty Nova isn't evil. He's just wildly insane, and follows his own goals no matter the cost to others. He is functionally immortal and absolutely willing to do things just to see what happens. However, the movie's incarnation of Nova is just of someone evil for the sake of it, again. It's boring and is totally against his character. He's not insane, and has no goal other than to be the big-bad. Remember, Flan is Life.

Speaking of stuff not utilized properly - Panzer Kunst being referenced but never really used as a foil to other styles was very poor - part of Alita's heritage doesn't come from her body, it comes from her Panzer Kunst. A BIG part of the motorball arc is where Alita learns to use her Panzer Kunst, including some vibrational attacks like Hertza Haeon, and how the constant combat of the circuit triggers some of her memories. I understand that the arc covered in the film wasn't big on Panzer Kunst useage, but since it was referenced I guess I expected something more.

-----

Alita as a movie is great to look at. The more rugged and twisted elements were toned down, but still executed pretty well. Seeing how the story was adjusted and altered made me a little sad, but many of the tiny details that were adapted properly definitely were fun to spot and glow about. The opening scene, for example, was almost shot-for-shot perfect with the manga's opening. I was very impressed that even those details were included.

Overall, I give Alita a 6/10. I couldn't get past some of the mischaracterizations, and seeing different arcs get tossed together strangely. Alita's love interest with Hugo was a bit over the top, but that's fine in the context of the film. Chiren existing, however, was totally out of line and definitely ate some of my enjoyment.

If you want a brain-off (heh) dystopian sci-fi flick, Alita is going to work for you. As a fan of the manga, I saw too many parallels that were just a touch off. As far as adaptations go, though, this one was pretty good. It was far better than the butchery done on Ghost in the Shell.",aoc6mr

eh7ssx4,"Am I the only one who felt frustrated by the story?  It was an entertaining popcorn movie for the most part, and the world building and visual were done exceptionally well, but I can't get over the fact that they leaned so much into setting up sequels they forgot to include any meaningful conclusion to any of the plots they introduced in this movie.   There's no climax and no resolution, both Hugo's and Vector's deaths were meaningless (zero chemistry between the leads I literally don't care about the boy, and since they tried so hard to set up Nova as the real Mastermind it was just like what Alita said: he was just a puppet).  There's both too little and too much story in this movie.  If the flashbacks & Nova parts were trimmed down and the motorball championship was given more focus and acted as the final arc it could've been a great movie.  Now it's just a mix bag of cool and frustrating moments.  All in all I'm still gonna watch the next one cause I'm interested in the characters and the world, but I hope they sort out the creative issue.",aoc6mr

But experiencing the story was like being tied down to a chair while someone shoves a 35ft sub down your throat. Too much, too quickly. I could physically see the pages of the manga flying by at a breakneck pace as we hopped from one set piece to the other. I just couldn't digest things long enough before the next scene came in and crawled in my mouth. Also Hugo's acting was crap, I constantly wanted him to die and didn't feel any chemistry when he was on screen with Alita. Thankfully my patience was rewarded when he was violently ripped to shreds then (supposedly) fell to his death...let me guess, he comes back right? The ending also fell flat, seems like there is still plenty of story to be told. Lots of questions, no answers.

I’m a big fan of traditional animation, but here I am just completely amazed at the CGI that went into this movie. The craft is impeccable. The action definitely isn’t a let down either. Overall, not a bad movie. Just think it could have been much better had it avoided some cliches, fleshed out the ending a bit more, and toned down the romance. I was hesitant to watch this because I’m not a YA fan in the slightest, and it’s rare for me to like a movie or book in that genre, but I’m glad I enjoyed this.

eh7fw02,"It was a topnotch action film. Loved the 3D on this one, really brought me into the film. I found it fun and interesting, the world-building felt really solid, not the clunky stuff you see in a lot of SF. Its solidity pointed up the clunkiness of Ready Player One, Elysium and Mortal Engines. THIS is how it's done.

I suspect that the solidity of the world building was because they have a rich source material to draw on from the original manga and anime. Marvel gets the same effect, creating complex stories with believable worlds and characters because they got decades of stories to work with, and can discard the trash and run with the good stuff. (A trick DC does not appear to have learned.)

The romance was, as has been described, a dopey teen romance, but it wasn't badly done enough to throw me off too much. I was able to overlook the romantic scenes and move on just fine. I'd recommend the film. I'd like to see some sequels. They didn't explore any of the darker aspects of a being a warrior cyborg like Blade Runner did, which is why Blade Runner is a great movie and this one is merely a very good one.

&#x200B;

I just got back from seeing it. I enjoyed it overall but it's flawed in some ways I didn't really expect.

&#x200B;

The action is fantastic throughout. The bar fight and subsequent underground battle both were great. The choreography of watching cyborgs battle had a lot of innovative and unique spectacles, including some surprisingly brutal kills.

&#x200B;

Somewhere in the writing this film got spliced into a futuristic Rollerball sequel. It isn't a black and white mash up however, as they did integrate many of the characters in the concept of Motorball but the sport itself is just a thin vehicle for theatrical violence, so much so they don't bother even explaining the rules. Ultimately it's just a McGuffin which is meant to get the main character to the BBE. Eye candy, but welcome eye candy none the less.

&#x200B;

The films main fault is that it's only a third of a story. Rather, it's the middle part of a three part story as we still do not know Alita's origins and her relationship with the primary antagonist, nor the primary antagonists motivations, NOR is there a satisfying conclusion between them. This is quite a bit more of a hindrance than I think the filmmakers felt it would be as the forward direction of the film feels meandering, yet it's over two hours long. There's a couple other niggling cliches (The bad guy appears right at the perfect time because""of course he does,"" and ""the bad guy kills the dog because he's bad"").

&#x200B;

In all it's far from a perfect film, but the action sequences hoist the stale plot square on their shoulders and marches it to the finish line. I'm looking forward to the sequel, if not for the closure, then for the great action.

Obviously ended for a sequel but I don't see that it can be much of a story in the sequel as it's pretty obvious what will happen, >!Alita will become champion, but then Nova will prevent her ascension to the city in the sky, because he controls everything, so she will lead a rebellion and final assault on the city, freeing the grounders, and killing Nova, all hail Alita RAWR!!!!<

And that cgi when >!Alita first wears the URM body, and does the pose on one finger was awesome!!<

Wish I could have seen more of >!Eiza González 😍 than just her face!< though.

Worth watching 👍",aoc6mr

The production budget for the movie was $170 million and the movie has only brought in $137 million so far. The movie has to generate double the production budget in order to just break even. Simply because of advertising, marketing and that they have to share the revenue with the theaters themselves.

The movie has a long ways to go before it breaks even (no studio profit). It's only been out for under a week. Hopefully it can turn it around but only time will tell.",aoc6mr

I hope it gets a sequel, though I imagine the budget was colossal, and big budget movies dropped in February (vs summer or Christmas) usually don't have a lot of studio faith in them. We'll just have to wait and see if it makes enough internationally to justify a sequel. And if it does, expect a lot of those other long-gestating adaptations to get the greenlight. ",aoc6mr

The love story didn't bother me this showing, but it didn't bother me the first time either.

Strangely Alita's eyes did not bother me one bit from the time she opened it. Maybe i've seen too many anime?

The most surprising thing about the rewatch that I kinda warmed up to Hugo. Didn't expect that to happen lol

The motorball sequences are pure exhilaration especially in 3D, I really hate 3D normally but this one was pretty worth it. The movie is really fucked up when you think about it, people get cut in half, decapitated, girl's whole limbs are cut off while flying in the air and she's jumping around with only an arm, a naked robot kisses her stepfather in the cheek and dances in front of him, the dialogue about how she can feel stuff even better leading up to the kiss, etc. It's a deeply weird and uneven movie, which I guess was precisely why I liked it so much.

The plot, story and acting were all fine but its the fight scenes and effects are perhaps the best I've EVER seen, surpassing any Star Wars film.  Right up there with Fellowship of the Rings and Avatar as far as I'm concerned.

- Less Nova, more Vector. keep Nova completely out and possibly reveal at the end. 

- A more one sided crush between Hugo and Alita. It would have been way better if Hugo was only using Alita for his own gains and would probably showcase how Iron City really works. This is a case where morally grey area could have really worked and would have been a real betrayal. 

- Less romance

- Less Hugo

- An ending with a climatic battle.

Pacing is all over the place, the relationship between hugo and alita is completely unnecessary and is one of the weakest parts of the film. It's also not that original. Motorball is a direct rip off of rollerball, and even in rollerball it deals with a dystopian society. And then it ends with ""Elysium."" The ending is also one of the cheapest, most insulting endings I have ever seen. Make sure you buy that next ticket to see what happens next! The character is also almost in no danger, she's the equivalent of a mary sue terminator.

The scene where she gets dismembered you could see coming from a mile away. How else was she supposed to get in her new mary sue armor after the Dr refused to do it? Easy, get dismembered. It's not just the unstoppable cute female that bothers me, I like the character (at least at the start), but shes all over the place. One second she's acting like a cute puppy and the next shes slicing dudes in half. Not even Jason Bourne was this bipolar, which is another film that this movie borrows from.

None of the characters work in this movie, all of the major stars are phoning in their performances. The Dr, Vector, and Connelly (cant even remember their names they were so forgettable) act bored out of their minds and they have no energy.

&#x200B;

Positives are of course that everyone else is mentioning because it's the only positive, is the CGI. The art design (with the exception of rollerball) is original and refreshing. The action sequences are good, but other than that this movie is a train wreck. 200 million dollars spent on this.

egd0hbp,"Honestly, it’s not as bad as early reviews are saying. The plot, acting, pacing, and dialogue are all over the place, but the visuals and action are another level.

I was surprised by how violent it was for a PG-13 movie, but I’m really glad it didn’t try to hide anything. Compared with Wolverine’s jump from PG-13 to R, I’m not sure if the MPAA rules have changed, but it x1-3 were lacking in showing how powerful wolverine was until Logan. The level of action/violence is fitting for the abilities and weapons the characters have. Seeing wolverine dig his claws into people with no blood is weird, I’m glad this movie used blue blood so they can go all out, along with some super creative deaths. 

I saw it in Dolby 3D (I usually stay far away from imax 3D or reald 3D because of how bad the colors are) and it was by far the best use of 3D that I can remember, although I saw Infinity War in 2D. Glad Cameron insisted on brighter projection.

His acting and dialogue were trash, but whoever played Alita made up for it ten fold.  The dialogue and character development is this film is heavily focused on developing Alita's character and story. Everyone else's dialogue seems more focused on building the dystopian cyberpunk world around her, and as a result their development suffers. However that is the only knock I came up with, and it is made up for in stunning visuals and fast paced action. This is the type of movie I point to when I say film critics are out of touch with moviegoers, mass negative reviews from the media, mass positive reviews from audiences. I read 5 reviews, all negative, all whining about the patriarchy, and all whining about the fact Alita was heterosexual with breasts.

egf83mh,"I've watched the movie a week ago (it came out earlier for us here) and my thoughts on it are...somewhat in line with the reviews, or at the least the rating it has gotten on Rotten Tomatoes.

It's not a BAD movie. It's FINE. It's ""OKAY"". At worst, it's ""serviceable"". 

You can watch it, have a good time, and don't feel like you wasted your money on it. The effects are the typical fair for any CGI heavy movie. They could have been ground breaking back then, but they're typical for modern movies nowadays. Alita's eyes can be jarring at first, but you get used to it as the movie goes on.

As for my thoughts on the story as a whole, the movie definitely has this weird...pacing issue. It doesn't follow the typical 3-act structure--which isn't bad mind you--just that here, it's quite noticeable. 

As the story goes on, you get the feeling that it's building up to something, but the payoff doesn't always feel...like it has that impact going for it? I think this is because this movie was adapted from a manga. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the source material is bad. I like the story as a whole. It showed promise. But it suffers from that...""arcs"" that are normally done when reading a manga. You notice it in the movie--the pacing feels off at times.

Hell, the ending isn't that much of a payoff either. It felt...hollow? Like yeah, we know who the villain is and then suddenly a [timeskip happens](#spoiler) and I was like: ""Wait what??? Seriously? You're going to do that?"" 

Doing that thing that it did seriously deletes narrative tension and I'm like: WHY????

But I digress.

If you're a fan of the source material, go for it. I'm sure you'll enjoy at least seeing the adaptation come to life on screen, if only for the novelty. This is my first interaction with the material, and I'm whelmed by it.

If you're looking for a good time, and want to have a fun evening with chums, sure, go watch it.

I think this movie could have been truly great if they just focused on an ending within this film, and not trying to set up future sequels with whatever “ending” we got.

It just felt unfinished; especially everything with Nova. That bummed me out because I was really enjoying it up until that point. Also I swear Nova looked like James Cameron and when it was revealed to be Edward Norton I was just like, “ok then.” The Nova stuff must have been cut to hell.

• They over explain/over simplify to the point that current and non-fans are bored, and they run out of time to even tell the story they wanted, leaving a super choppy and confusing mess; or
• They adopt the names (with sometimes bad pronunciation) and overall key plot, but change literally everything else. Leaving current fans angry that they would even try, only to botch it.

Not sure why the hate other than the expectation that every movie has to aim to be a 10.

I feel Alita knew what it was and it was good at it. The CG was good, the action was awesome. I liked the characters too and how they really felt like anime in proportions and acting, even if it was very cheesy at times.

I liked how Alita looked and her expression. I gotta say for a movie relying so much on CG it was only a few times that I could really say it looked bad. It was overall a great job.

The one thing I can have issues with is that a lot of the story felt rushed because I know the anime/manga was longer, but at the same time I don't want filler to signify the pass of time and I doubt they had budget for a lot more action.

This movie is a very solid 7 for me and a very fun time. I saw it in 3D and it wasn't half bad. I think this is another succesful anime adaptation for any hater that keep saying there haven't been good ones, maybe we just haven't had a perfect 10 yet.

CGI and special effects - 10/10, I'd expect nothing less from Cameron's movie. 

The story and scenery was superb. An android learning how to use her body, trying ordinary food for the first time and interacting with animals in a cyberpunk universe? Fuck, I'd watch 3 hour long ""slice of life"" movie just with Alita exploring the Iron City... BUT

And that's a big, fat BUT. The dialogue and the love story are complete garbage. ""it's based on a manga"" is not an excuse for sloppy writing.
I was so happy when Hugo died, my only wish is that it could have happened much earlier. How can you keep such a flat character alive for so long is beyond me.

Overall, Alita: Battle Angel is good and I'll be recommending it to everyone. Just please, for christ's sake, let someone else write the sequel. ",aoc6mr

Just the doc, his assistant and the street kids. 

Why was Alita in the trash though? That part didn't make sense to me. She is supposed to be 300 old, but she isn't even well hidden in the trash, she was found so easily.

- IMAX 3D (in the largest cinema with 20 rows)
- DOLBY ATMOS REAL D 3D (in a small cinema with 11 rows)

For the IMAX 3D screening the best seats are already taken, for the REAL D 3D almost all seats are still available.

AFAIK REAL D 3D should offer the better 3D experience, but the IMAX 3D cinema has a way larger screen.

Which version would you choose and why?

ei5ap1x,"In general I'd  say it was a good movie, but most of the problems boil down to one word: Rushed.

They tried to cram too much of the story into the film.  The result is that they had to rely on infodumping for some of the worldbuilding.  Often times the character development is rushed too, so when a character changes their mind on something it seems less like a ""development"" and more like the character was just fickle.  There isn't really enough time to digest anything before the next thing gets shoved at you.

Weirdly enough, I felt like Christoph Waltz's performance was one of the weak points.  I just couldn't get the doctor's emotions in the movie, they just didn't seem... genuine?  All the other actors did great though.  Rosa Salazar did amazing as Alita.

However, the world is beautiful and deep, the visuals are amazing, and they didn't cut out any of the grittiness from the manga.  It's still a very good movie.  Good enough that I wish that they'll make a trilogy (or maybe a quadrilogy) to finish off the rest of the story from the manga.",aoc6mr
ei9sb4w,"I've only watched the movie last week, spontaneously before Captain Marvel (since it seems they're mortal rivals now O\_o). 

It's very rough. At first I was deceived, I thought ""Wait, they said it's Steven Spielberg! I remember even his bad movies were smooth."" But then in the end I've realized that it was directed by Robert Rodriguez, and everything fell into it's place. 

Alita is very adorable and animated... em.. for an animated character, even those weird eyes didn't distract me much. Visuals are incredibly intricate and breathtaking, cyborg's designs are incredible. 

For all its bumps and seemingly disjointed story, movie did one important thing - it made me to go check out the manga. And once I've read it (I'm still reading it, just finished the original and moved to Last Order) everything became clear - movie clearly tried to cram as much of the manga as possible into it's runtime, like getting into fight with Gravish/Makaku, getting berserker body, love story with Hugo (still better love story than Twilight), Motorball arc - that's basically three volumes worth of plot that were separate in the manga hammered together here. That's a Last Airbender-grade mistake >.<.

And at the same time elements that are adapted are surprisingly faithful to the original, almost shot for shot. In fact that made reading manga much more rewarding and retroactively improved the movie for me.

egg2076,I loved it.  ,aoc6mr
eglffyx,"Well, the wife and I absolutely adored the film. I read the first volume of the manga over and over again as a kid and my wife was completely new to Alita. Both of us felt like it exceeded our expectations.

They really nailed Alita herself. Rosa Salazar and Weta brought her to life so fully and completely, the strength of that performance really carried the whole movie. Alita is simply an exciting hero to watch onscreen. She is funny, she is sincere, she is courageous, she is surprising. 

Even if they had failed at everything else, it would have been worth watching just for how exciting, empathetic and aspirational they made that character.

A lot of people are complaining about Hugo; I thought he was fine. He was a little too disneyfied but there were some cute scenes between him and Alita and there’s nothing wrong with that. 

Christophe Waltz as Ido was fantastic and they struck a fine balance with that character who could have potentially been really creepy if not handled correctly.

The action scenes were really fun and well blocked. There has never been anything like Motorball onscreen. The closest thing I can think of is Speed Racer.

Much like John Wick, the action is often exciting not because you fear Alita will lose, but because you know a terrible evil asshole is about to finally get what they deserve.

Also, nothing can prepare you for how fucking weird this movie is. I was sure they would tone it down and disney-fy it from the comics, and they did a little bit (I remember that the comics had a villain who might even pass the R rating for violence), but still I don’t know how this movie got a PG-13 rating.

The only part I didn’t like was one scene toward the end where Alita was suddenly just *ridiculously* overpowered and it wasn’t really explained. That action scene either needed to feel more difficult/dangerous, or be removed entirely. It was the only time I felt like the whole thing turned into a videogame trailer. You’ll know it when you see it.

All in all, wife and I both left the theater fully satisfied and hoping for a sequel. As far as crowd-pleasing popcorn movies go I think this is an exemplary way to do it: the CGI is used to tell a story and not just throw gobbledegook in your face, the lead performance is dynamic and exciting, the setting is interesting, the action is exquisitely shot, and the pacing is perfect. I didn’t really notice other flaws because they nailed the basics so well.",aoc6mr
egmwz7m,"I left the theater a couple hours ago and I'm still thinking about how much I enjoyed the movie.

I really hope this movie does well, so I am trying to put it on blast the best I can to get people I know to go see it.

It is encouraging that it is outpacing expectations, even if that is still less than a movie of this budget needs to make. If enough people get the word out I feel like the audience could grow and turn this into a box office success.

On another note, I saw Robert Rodriguez talk about the movie at the Crunchyroll Expo, and was very encouraged at that time about the finished movie. And I was not disappointed at all. It actually beat my expectations. I didn't read the manga because I wanted to keep a little bit of mystery, but I'm going to start reading the volumes now.",aoc6mr

I saw an article on twitter earlier in the week that said the film was a ""$200m bomb"" so assumed it had already been released in the US and flopped, so when I went to see it yesterday in my country I was treating it as a standalone, so the ending disappointed me a little as it's clearly there to set up Alita 2.

egj5uih,"I loved this movie so much, it felt long in a good way, I kept expecting it to fade to black for a cliffhanger but instead it just kept on going. And I loved that.

Alita was really sweet. I liked her huge eyes even in the kissing scene where it keeps cutting between hers and his comparatively tiny ones. She was also a badass which is always a good thing in my book. I loved the direction it went with the love story guy, killing him off twice was great and I loved how it was done both times. People are saying that the love story was bland but I think all love stories are bland so it wasn’t out of the ordinary for me.

Lots of people didn’t seem to like the first 30 minutes but I found them to be very interesting. I liked all the hints about the father, and Alita as a person was great to be with.

Although I wish they had explained a little more about the fall and the society but I guess hat was all saved for the sequel that I really want us to get. I want to know how the hell the Martians lost. They had blades that could cut through anything like butter, supersoldiers that can make mincemeat of any hand to hand combatant.

The movie didn’t have a traditional plot and I liked that. It felt more like Alita’s journey to become the battle angel and I was very satisfied with how it ended. Although Vector and Nova were very weak villains. Especially the former. I literally know nothing about him apart from his ability to control people.",aoc6mr

Special effects, action, and especially the WORLD and ALITA were amazing. Alita as a character was alone worth the ticket price, definitely the highpoint of the movie for me.

I'm really hoping this won't be another great movie that ends up not making any money in the box office (ie. Blade Runner 2049, First Man...). The movie sets up a sequel very well and it feels like the first of a trilogy. So I'm hoping it makes enough money so they'll make a sequel, because I'm dying for more.",aoc6mr

egkvv3q,"Too much of what I didn't like and not enough of what I did.

I understand writers and directors wanting to stay faithful to original works, but that doesn't absolve them from putting out a mediocre to bad product. The writing and character development is just bad. Nothing is subtle. Everyone's mind is instantly changed after seeing or hearing one thing. I think this can work, but not when the main plot point is a teenage romance. That just makes me cringe. If Alita spends the entire movie winning people to her side through her righteous actions to fight the baddies in the sky that works for me. I can't be bothered to care about some childish relationship and a sport that has no discernible rules.

The world building is incredibly interesting, though. It was the reason I stayed engaged throughout the whole movie. I was really looking forward to getting some clarity, so the ending being what it was did disappoint me. Still, there is an interesting story to tell there.

As someone said below, the motivations of each character lacked sufficient depth, which made their respective lines and behaviors seem much emptier and quite bizarre at times. Thank goodness we had the likes of Christoph, Jennifer, and Mahershela at least delivering great performances with what they had to work with, otherwise...

Keean Johnson actually held his own in terms of dialogue delivery, but I really missed the almost cult-like behavior and attraction the anime/manga Hugo held towards Zalem. It was understandably retooled to remove even more complexity in an already very oversaturated film, but [watch how Hugo *should've* behaved throughout his final scene with Alita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WilYxdq6wU) - now you might understand why he's a much less cliche character than he was written in this adaptation.

the romance stuff is terrible and forced, hugo and alita have no chemistry, alita calling the doctor her ""dad"" after knowing him for a few days was super cringe. This movie doesnt even have a proper beginning, middle, and end. The plot and pacing are whack, one moment she is carrying alien armor from an underwater spaceship, the next she is staring at a dude while he sleeps. Hugo's actor is a terrible actor, none of the villains are fleshed out and the dialogue feels very unnatural at times. 

Did not find Alita to be a compelling character in the slightest.  She is cute, and she is a good fighter, and that's it, she has no personality to speak of. All I see in these comments are people saying she's ""cute and badass"", but guys, that's not a personality. Think about badass people in real life, are they badass b/c they go around fighting? That's not a badass, that's a thug. Badass people are confident, good leaders, decisive,  don't take bullshit, etc. There are badass moments Alita has like when she talks smack to the guys in the bar, and also when she says ""fuck your mercy"" and yet she never displays these qualities ever again? Why doesn't she get witty in other bad guy encounters, or act snarky with her competitors in the motorball ""tryouts"". I would like her so much more if any of her displayed traits were consistent throughout the film. The only interesting things about her are her forgotten past but we barely get any of that here. seems like such an interesting universe, but hardly any world-building to speak of.

egnbv6u,"just got out of the theater. i thought it was really fucking weird, **BUT! i have never read/seen Gunnm, nor did i know it was based on a manga and anime in the first place**. because of this, i’m *sure* i'll get a lot of flak for not appreciating the movie for what it was in regards to the source material, and that's ok, because my opinion is no doubt less informed than those who have read the manga and seen the anime. here are my thoughts, text wall incoming:

&#x200B;

* it felt *very* strangely paced. it had almost zero buildup to Alita as a character, then it felt a little slow for a while, then it smoothed out until the end which again, felt super abrupt and jarring. i've read in this thread that that may be just how mangas (and Japanese entertainment in general) are set up with  4-act structures, so that could be it. 
* i didn't really feel any investment in any of the characters besides Alita herself, and even then i didn't feel like she was very fleshed out.^lol i was hoping for more of her moon battle flashbacks, but they never came. 
* the lore seemed cool, but lacking. i understood the background just fine but i feel like there was a lot that went unexplained. i think that as someone without any prior knowledge i would have liked to see an extra 10-20 mins of backstory here and there to explain ""the fall"" a little bit more and maybe see some more of the super cool moon flashback sequences.  
* so, so cheesy. the acting was good for the most part but the dialogue was just really weird and clunky for me sometimes. the love subplot i felt was awful, but i've read in this thread that it's bad in the manga too so that may be forgiven.
* it seemed like the movie threw too many villains in my face at once, and had them switch to be the ""main baddie"" for a while, only to be replaced in the next scene. Grewishka seemed intimidating, but then he was just a hunter working for Vector, who was a proxy for Nova, who i never learned anything about, and then Zapan was thrown in there as kind of a rogue baddie just so that Alita could have conflict with her bounty hunter status.
* which brings me to my next (admittedly small) complaint, how Alita flat out walked into the base or whatever and just *became* a Hunter Warrior with zero explanation as to what the process was. it seemed like there was just an application to fill out and then BAM! Hunter Warrior. ""please sign here, initials here, date here, accept terms and conditions here. all done!"" no physical challenges to prove your worth as a bounty hunter? seemed a little weird. 
* the sound was SUPER loud, to the point where i winced a little bit in combat sequences when a sword sliced someone in half (which was fucking awesome, by the way) because it sounded like screeching and there were times when i literally couldn't understand what a character was saying. it's totally possible that the theater i saw it in had its sound mixed too loud or something, because it didn't feel like it was the same as other movies i've seen. 
* my theater (including myself) literally laughed when Hugo died for the second time. i can see the gravitas they were going for there, but i felt pretty much nothing and that whole conversation was really corny
* the dog dying made me very sad, i wish he came back as a cyborg later in the movie :( 
* i thought the ending was lame.
* holy FUCK, this movie was absolutely fucking gorgeous. i have exactly zero complaints about how it looked. i was a little bit skeptical about how a 100% CGI human character would work out being on screen for an entire 2 hours, but it did. the action was spectacular too, i’m really  impressed at how Rodriguez pushed the PG-13 rating and handled just about every single fight scene. extremely well done there. 


overall, i didn't love it. i'm not a fan of manga or anime so i’m 100% certain i’m not appreciating the movie for what it is in its entirety, but when i left the theater i kind of asked myself, ""what the hell did i just watch?"" 

having read the feedback here on this thread i think i'll see it again now that i have a bit more knowledge, but on first watch i'm not too impressed. it was certainly entertaining and look fantastic, but overall i'd give it a 6.5-ish out of 10. thanks for reading!

ei659q1,"Watched it today. Feels rushed, had boring sidecast and way too few background info and a very unexpected ending that had no foundation in the movie. like ""Shadow of the former self"" or, errr... ""new-found self"". 

I was really rooting for the movie and her after 30 minutes, but it fell flat after the climax. Very sad. 

The love interest was completely out of place and it never was explained why they'd even love anything or be loved by humans. The world that was depicted showed everything as ""replaceable"" and grim. Lost a leg? No biggie? Completely dismembered? Ah, just get a new body. There's no place for love, let alone amongst machines. There's humans and cyborgs - you don't fall in love with that, given the society circumstances and ""values""..

egfqcg2,"Forget the movie, the casting/cameos for this movie were super interesting. 

After *If Beale Street Could Talk* and this, Ed Skrein is really settling well into the 'ultimate scumbag' character role. He really has the face for it and pulls it off perfectly. I wonder if he'll be playing a Japanese Aircraft Carrier in Roland Emmerich's *Midway* next year.

This is the easiest gig Edward Norton has ever landed. This movie has absolutely no shot at a sequel so the entire set-up for his character was for nothing. He showed up for 2 days on set (in-between shots of *Motherless Brooklyn* no doubt) to just stare into the distance for a few seconds each day. Must be nice. He looked *really old* in this too.

I 100% thought that the Eiza Gonzalez character/cyborg was Halsey (the singer) at first. It's almost uncanny how they looked and sounded a like.

Also, did I hallucinate or did Jai Courtney have a random 5-second cameo in there as a MotorBall player? What the hell was that about?

Jackie Earle Haley in the 'Hammiest Performance of 2019' so far, that was fun.

Keean Johnson is apparently the actor you get if Timothee Chalamet's upcoming schedule is full. He's 100% a clone, even the mannerisms are the same. Even the haircut. He's like the Value Brand Chalamet.

Apparently fuckin' Casper Van Dien was in this? How in the hell did I miss that?

Jennifer Connelly & Mahershala Ali just out here cashing checks. Don't blame them, this was definitely a movie for that.

I had a blast during this purely based on the cast. Couldn't care less about the plot.

I actually enjoyed most of it, except for the dialogue. Initially I was wary since I didn't like the big anime eyes on the main character, but I had fun watching this despite the cheesy dialogue. The action and world building was enjoyable. But yeah, dialogue was cheesy and cliche most of the time. ",aoc6mr

There is some good potential here for sequels, but I would like to see them spend some more time on the writing, even if that means deviating form the source material.",aoc6mr
egpne03,"Some tropey plot bits and character beats aside, _Alita_ was pretty entertaining! Although at times it did have the feel of just moving from one action setpiece or fight sequence to another with some dumped exposition in between, the action itself was really strong, even a bit more violent at times than I'd have expected from a PG-13 movie. Impressive sound and visuals, too.. actually some of the best CGI and motion capture I've seen in awhile, and choice use of 3D. And there's some enjoyable performances to be found here too from Christoph Waltz and Rosa Salazar, with Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali commanding the screen like they always do. Overall, I thought it was quality dystopic action/sci-fi and made for a great theater watch. The ending's a little too sequel-baity for my taste, but nonetheless I'd be down for the next installment if this one does well enough to greenlight it. ",aoc6mr

egtqjr5,"It's been a few days since I watched this, and this is a really hard movie for me to explain how I feel about it.  The stuff that I liked I really liked, but the stuff I didn't like I really hated.  I think on balance I would say that I didn't like the movie, but I'd still be there opening weekend if it gets a sequel and I really hope that it does.  I've read through some of the other comments here and I'm seeing that people liked and disliked the same things as me, but I'm more down on the movie than a lot of commenters here. For context, I have never read the manga or watched the original animated movie(movies?), so I'm a complete newbie to the story. 

What I liked: The action is awesome. From the first fight scene with Alita defending Ido to the final motorball scene the action is both clear (no *Transformers* incomprehensible scenes here) and it really pumps you up.  I'd say it has the best action since *Mission Impossible Fallout*.  Rosa Salazar is great as Alita, and I'm pretty much always going to like it when a movie has Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali, and Jennifer Connelly in supporting roles. I also loved Frank Lapidus himself as the hunter with dog cyborgs, and I hope if the sequel happens he'd be in it more. The moment of seeing Chiren's brain, eyes, and heart stuffed in a case was one of the more horrifying images I can remember in a film, and it's something I'll have in my head for a while. And finally, I really liked the world as shown in this movie.  I want to learn more about its history and what life is like on Zalem, and I'm very interested in where the story goes from here.

What I didn't like: Motorball as a sport is something between utterly nonsensical and poorly explained. I get that it's mostly an excuse to have cool action scenes and shows how desensitized the culture is to extreme violence, but as a sports fan it just doesn't work for me because the game doesn't make sense. I also know this isn't an original thought, but Keean Johnson was terrible as Hugo and it kind of ruins a lot of the movie for me. I didn't particularly like any of the performances from the others in his friend group, either. I've read here that in the source material it's less of a ""couple of destiny"" thing and more of an ""unrequited love"" thing, and I think that would have probably worked better. I'm also not as high as some others on the CGI in this. Don't get me wrong, it's impressive from a technical point of view, but it has the side effect of making everything look fake to me. All the partially CGI characters, Alita included, just look off to me.  To make a comparison to another movie that got a lot of acclaim for its visuals, I felt the same way about the Orcs in *Warcraft*, they just looked fake to me. A lot of the dialogue isn't very good.  Sometimes it's super exposition-y, other times (like the bar scene) it's really cheesy.

I really can't think of another movie that has so many things I loved combined with so many things I hated. I think my score for the movie would be 2/5, but I kind of feel like scoring the movie doesn't really explain how I feel about it.",aoc6mr

That being said, how the hell does urm a space faring group of humans with super advanced androids that are powered by anti matter reactors who collectively can outclass virtually any fighter get defeated by a floating city that has anti air guns and sheer rings. Like wtf? Why hype up alita as being the last of the most advanced fighting machine system when the people who made her can't defeat anti air guns. Unless they have a dam forcefield around the top of the city I don't understand why they couldn't break through, they could have easily just cut all the cables and layed siege to zalem and starved the city of it's resources because as far as we have been shown, zalem didn't really have any ground forces, or troops that could really give the beserkers a run for their money.

Yes the going up in body parts was a major plot point I was anxious the whole movie waiting for it to show up. At last I see some ppl asking who the big bad was.

But after watching the movie again, I think the costume designer did a really bad job. Iron City is in the 26th century but everyone dress like typical New Yorker, look positive, friendly and somehow carefree. In some scenes, extras wander around like tourists. It isnt contribute at all to the worn out look of the city and the struggle life of its people as described by Dr. Ido and Hugo throughout the film. That also made me not really sympathy with Alita, Chiren and especially Hugo.",aoc6mr
egm0tu5,"Really enjoyed it, and Im looking forward to the next few (hopefully?)

The first 30 minutes were poorly done, and you could tell it was rushed. 

The rest of the movie felt great, and didn't have that 'condensed from source material' vibe that a lot of adaptions get (cough, harry potter). 

I really liked the villain angle, and I felt the change of heart by the mom was real enough.  In fact, all the characters felt real to me, and had decent personalities, which was impressive because there were a lot of them, and many didn't get a lot of screen time.  <- this is incredibly important to world building and fandom.  The guy with the dogs was interesting enough to get a spin-off.  Motorball is awesome, and we don't even know the rules.

Hugo was fine for me as well. I went into the movie expecting a half-baked romance based on the reviews, but clearly there are just a lot of bandwagon sheeple out there spewing other peoples opinions.  It wasn't nearly as bad as people say it was.

Ido was great.  Love christopher waltz man.  He's so good.

Fight scenes were awesome.  

Came home and Thor Ragnarok was on -  It felt ridiculous in comparison to what I just watched.  

In terms of a fun and entertaining blockbuster, this was a 9/10.  I have no reason to judge it as anything more than that.  If you're on the fence, and you love action movies with a decent story and some great visuals, this should work for you as long as you can get past the first 30 minutes.

eh6zze2,"Heads up: this is not a complete movie. All of the filler from the manga that you would expect to be cut is kept in, and the main story (as much as their is one) isn't remotely resolved by the end. Except it doesn't really *end* so much as it *stops.* It's more than sequel-baiting, it's a cliffhanger right as things start happening, that you would expect on a badly paced Netflix show, not a movie. Even Fellowship of the Ring had its own climax, even though it was just a Part 1. There is no climax in this movie, in fact if you were to watch a random scene you probably wouldn't be able to guess if it was from the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd act (I'm not even sure if there ARE acts in this movie). And unlike Fellowship, we're not going to get the sequels, because this movie is bombing, so this movie is going to have to stand on its own.

But all the Cyberpunk insanity from the manga is here. You could watch this movie on mute and still get tons of enjoyment out of it. This may not be a great movie, but it is a series of great scenes. They don't go as out there with the cyborg bodies as the manga does, but they don't reign it in nearly as much as you would expect from Holly.

**Positives:**

- Visuals

- Action choreography ([that flashback fight scene on the moon was my favorite,](#spoiler) but all the action was well done and easy to follow)

- Music (Tom always does a great job even if some parts reminded me of BvS)

- Actors (Rosa Salazar was great, even though it was a fully CG character you really connected with her. The other stand out for me was Mahershala Ali.)

- I loved that we hardly saw the main villain but instead saw his actions/commands through others lower down the chain.

**Negatives:**

egd4w5h,"I read the manga up to the point where a certain character eats it and things start to focus more on Motorball. I really wanna go back and finish it off after watching this.

From my admittedly limited exposure to the comic, the movie did a great job capturing the feel and aesthetic. Its depiction of cybernetic enhancement and prosthetics could've gone Hollywood and ended up a bit generic (The Jackets from Edge of Tomorrow vs All You Need is Kill) but they nailed it. It ended up looking unique and visually impressive.

Also impressed by how well they followed the plot while condensing it. I did stop before the end but the story beats that were in the movie were pretty damn close to the book. I will say that some plot points being shifted from later in the book and incorporated into the story earlier was a great move, if only to get more Motorball, but it did hurt the pacing a bit for me. It felt like the world building and the backbone of the plot were rushed through early as a result.

That aside, I loved it. Had its cheesy moments but I'd argue it was a great adaptation and it's got me rereading and finally finishing the source material. I really hope it doesn't bomb and does get to follow up on its ending.",aoc6mr
egdg19k,"Surprised how easy people are going on the movie's script, which I thought was horrible. The opening is really rushed and characters are just lazily introduced by coincidentally stumbling across Alita.

There's so much painfully bad exposition, the romance is awful and the tone veers wildly from scene to scene (the dog death felt cheap and Alita using its blood was just totally off).

An impressive visual showcase and Rosa Salazar did a good job, but woof this was so badly written.",aoc6mr
eh04rvg,"Id like to premise, im not a bot, dont call me a bot for liking the movie.

&#x200B;

It was probably... The greatest film ive watched to date. Some may hate it, but it felt so engrossing. There wasnt a moment when i watched it i wasnt entertained. I honestly think think this movie deserves 100% more praise than it gets.

&#x200B;

The music was nice, you got to see the main character, grow form this hunk of metal, to a heroine with a rich past, and deeper purpose, that inspires thousands. She was fully grown but.. she was like a child and you got to see her deal with life, death, and love using emotions she only just discovered, and how she dealt with a challenge with these child like emotions. If you focus on the film, dont say ""im going to hate this"", ignore outside 3rd party opinions, i can almost promise you, youll have a great 2 hour experience watching it.

&#x200B;

I go to the theatre quite a bit, I saw Infinity War, The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi(bomb) all in theatre, just to name a few, and personally Alita tops every single one of them. Im not a woman, and i still left the theatre just... motivated and inspired by the movie. Its story was just so well set, though some may say its rushed, its a 2 hour movie, the only part i could think of possibly being considered rushed is the opening scene, even thats pushing it.

You can have a different opinion, this was just my experience, and its one of my favorite movies after seeing it... topping even the Marvel franchise and James Camerons own Avatar.",aoc6mr
egcxc8y,"I thought it was a pretty nice movie, it feels a bit like speed racer the movie, if you liked that you would like this. Great visuals and action,  but story is cliche and characters motivations pretty flat. I haven’t seen the anime or read the manga so I can’t compare but it definitely feels like a bunch of episodes of an anime condensed into a movie, as it goes from one plot point to another. 

But I think if you liked old school anime you would dig this, but just don’t go expecting some high grade storytelling. 7/10 for me. I hope to see the sequel if it gets made, definitely lots of stuff they left for a sequel. ",aoc6mr

eglb5kn,"It was a great manga adaption ... as a movie, the first half was really really good (maybe 2/3rd) but I think because they didnt know if the movie got a sequel, they tried to pack too many story hooks from the manga into it and the last part is a bit too .. hmm .. bloated, so it got no real, satisfying final and felt all over the place.

For example, the motorball thing is a big part of Alitas story in the manga and got a separate ark they're, but felt a bit underdeveloped and too short, in the movie... the motoball visuals are quite fun and stunning, though, so they obviously put it in for that aspect. BUT all ij all it really is good and a great entry into the series and I enjoyed it immensely ...oh, and the visuals are awesome. 

This was the first movie in what feels like a decade where the hype was real, the creators respected the source material and they didn't fuck it up. Disney, please take note. ",aoc6mr
egs5bv2,"The Kansas Bar brawl stands as the only cathartic scene in a movie filled with action sequences. The energy of the bar fight scene is fueled by a young girl wanting to prove her worth by taking on the world's most dangerous hunters. The hunters' transition from arrogant laughter to utter shock is satisfying to watch. 

The other action sequences feel flat in comparison. While the Motorball games are brutal and exciting, it never feels like Alita is in danger. And that is quite a recurrent problem. The final fight is against Grewishka, a second rematch already by which point the audience is not afraid since Alita blinded the brutish oaf despite having one arm in their last encounter.

The movie unfortunately comes after the likes of Elysium and Ghost in the Shell, with a predictable post-apocalyptic world that is populated with characters who act exactly the way you'd expect them to act.

Also, Hugo's head falling to his death looks awful and was met with scattered laughter from the audience.",aoc6mr

From the scene where she first awakens and starts trying the food I knew I was going to like her a lot more than your typical female YA protagonist.

egg5nb2,"Fans of the film, I'm curious (in a genuine way) as to what you felt about empathising with characters, or feeling truly engaged to the action? I just couldn't engage at all and I blame the choppy script for not allowing any particular story or idea to breathe. For example, did you feel a single thing when Hugo died? He was bland to begin with, ambiguous and confused as a character, then was turned into a cyborg with no reaction/panic/transition at all (I thought of Murphy's chilling shriek at realising he had no body in the Robocop remake), starts running up a huge cable with perfect agility, then falls slow-motion through fog (that appears out of nowhere because we see the city below in all other shots) in what looks like its supposed to be a sad scene but just wasn't at all. The whole film felt like this for me, just 'this is happening, now that is happening, oh remember this - well now that' without any genuine sense of emotional engagement. So if you loved it, I'm curious as to whether you *did* feel engaged (or felt sad when Hugo died), or whether you simply don't mind not feeling engaged and just enjoy it on some other level.   ",aoc6mr
egiot24,"Overall I enjoyed the movie. It had excellent action, visuals, and a strong third act which made up for a weak beginning. A lot of people have pointed out how weak the romance was. I think it's part of a bigger problem about how the main protagonists had rather boring personalities.

\- Alita was a good character, but she needed more moments (like the weird ""I'd give you my heart scene"") which showed how she was not only physically different, but also emotionally crazy (Or as she puts it ""all or nothing""). Also delve more into the notion that she gets a high from combat and violence.

\- Hugo was the worst. A character straight out of a Disney channel movie. He practically falls in love with Alita from first sight until the very end, it makes for a boring romantic arc. His feelings for Alita should have had more sense of progression. He ought to have been more aloof or disinterested in the beginning, and then gradually fall in love and make sacrifices for Alita. It would also contrast very nicely with Alita's arc of being head over heels in love at the beginning, and being in better control of her emotions towards the end. In addition, having his character be more 'douchey' in the beginning would lend itself to the idea that he grew up in a tough environment, and was willing to do unsavory things, even working with the antagonist.

\- Ido was somewhat disappointing. His character has such an interesting premise (He's a genius who builds robots out of junkyard parts in a dystopian sci-fi world!), but personality wise he ended up being little more than ""kind and overprotective dad"" trope. He ought to have had more quirks and eccentricities.

I haven't read the Manga, but from what I gather it seems like these characters were more complex and nuanced in the original story.",aoc6mr
egkx65d,Also one fun note - the woman who plays Alita also played that shirtbird cop who banged MGK in Birdbox. ,aoc6mr
eglcuwt,"I loved it... the first half was actually totally brilliant and compelling, after that there were some clunky and uninspired segments that connected to brilliant high points. Agree that Hugo is the weak link, but in his defense it really doesn't feel like you're supposed to like him that much and part of her love for him has something to do with the kind of innocence she has and her intense emotional nature. It does seem kind of fitting when he dies in the end. Will be buying the 4k of this, most likely, it has some really unique beats and Alita herself is wonderful. One more thing I'll say is that despite its breakneck editing, the film doesn't seem to be relentlessly pursuing its plot in every moment. It really builds a world and takes you into different moments in this world throughout a period of time, making her character arc the plot itself as evidenced by the ending, showing the achievement of her status compared to when we meet her. It's an old school kind of thing compared to highly cohesive modern blockbusters and it has James Cameron's signature on it in the end. Some really bad parts but loved it overall.",aoc6mr
egmxpur,"I thought Rosa Salazar was great despite the eyes/CGI being kind of distracting, and some of the action scenes are really well staged. But other than that, I kinda didn't get anything out of this. The setting isn't terribly unique or interesting and neither is the plot. It lacked a focus and a forward momentum, it was kind of all over the place trying to fit too much in at the expense of characters. None of the dramatic beats hit, and when that boy died at the end I was actually chuckling. Their relationship and his performance were so awful.",aoc6mr

egjq7ns,"It's not a bad movie, it's just a movie you realize is better than the political bullshit that just makes you feel like shit after you leave it.

For me the issue is the 2 main people have no chemistry. I actually thught Alita and the Ed Skein character Zapan had tons more chemistry and would like to see them together over her and the main guy. They have a nice friendship but there's no spark or energy between the 2 characters that is dramatic to watch

The CGI was pretty good I felt the story itself was flat and boring. The 2 main characters I think were standouts were Alita and Zapan. Also the bounty hunter with the robot dogs were pretty cool. When the dad pulled out the giant blade as a hunter that was actually really pleasing to watch and wish they used it more. 

Overall I give it a ""check it out"". You might be surprised. Instead of constantly giving money to movies you know are going to be bad I say give this one a chance and maybe it might surprise you. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but there's some decent stuff in there

And her eyes in the movie are ok imo. They fixed it from the original trailer from what i heard. I think James Cameron told Robert Rodriguez to increase the iris's size which made it more believable and less Uncanny valley-e.

I can't recommend this movie for everyone but i think those of you looking for a decent movie with great effects and some very unique lore this might be somewhat in a cult classic film like Dredd in a lot of ways


EDIT: I think i want to add I think the movie could have been a lot better if it didn't stick to the source material so much. I think of the Robocop reboot where I was watching it and thought ""This movie could have been really really good if they didn't feel the need to make it a reboot of Robocop and just make an original movie that could have it's own plot points"". Again I go back to Zapan and Alita having a lot of chemistry together but in the manga I believe Alita is with the boy she's with in the movie",aoc6mr
eh0i4kj,"I and my girlfriend, we both enjoyed it very much. I went in with pretty low expectations, being very skeptical of anime adaptations.

The plot is very predictable, but that's okay, it's kind of hard to be surprised when you have read the original. The animation and the visuals in general are superb. I thought the acting was solid, even if it's a bit hard to tell with all that CG work. Christoph Waltz (without the -er, which is good) is always a joy to see, and it will never get old to say that he's my countryman. At some points, I thought he was bored by the dialog, and justifiedly so: the low points of the movie are the abysmal, melodramatic, expository dialog and the stupid love story. Jennifer Connelly, of course, is always a delight.

Watching a cute little girl kick ass is surprisingly cathartic, I can't get enough of it even if it gets repetitious after a while.

The world-building is quite fine as long as you don't overthinkt it. It's said to be this horrible dystopian post-apocalypse city, but really everyone seems quite okay, they don't suffer from hunger or live on the streets, I mean even the poor bright-eyed kid has his own little apartment. There don't seem to be any epidemics, a whole lot of people have access to excellent cyber tech, there's no oppression really (Don't want to clash with the hunter-gatherers or whatever they're called? Well duh, don't murder folks. Simple.) The only thing to complain about is that those above have it better. In short, I don't buy the dystopia, and I don't think they did this on purpose. It's a classic ""show don't tell"" moment.

Now, the anime eyes... well yeah. That's bad. In fact, it is terrible. Here's basically a girl in her early teens, mentally as well as physically, with childlike attributes overexaggerated anime-style - only then she gets an upgrade for bigger tits, and now she's ready for some pow-chicka-pow-wow. I'm exaggerating a bit for dramatic effect, but that really does bother me a bit. Don't make me watch a minor in a sexualized context, please, however tame and innocent, and don't give me that ""she's really 300 years old"" bullshit, thanks alot. I don't want to be made to feel like a pedophile; in a movie like that, I don't need anything edgy and unsettling. I want some ass-kicking and a few cool one-liners and good CG.",aoc6mr
egmruso,"Man I do *not* get how everyone here is praising this film so thoroughly. It felt like a third of the movie was just recycled cliches. And I get that it's an adaptation of a manga that is decades old, but it's not like everything was a 1-to-1 match anyway. Hugo was wet toilet paper of a character with next to no personality and a character arc that made him feel like a robot flicking a switch into good guy mode. Ido, with Waltz trying as hard as he could, has dialogue so barren that it really makes no sense for him to be helping Alita in the middle and end with her Motorball gear. Do we really need to see a person go ""Hold on to my hand! You're falling, noo..."" scene for the 78th time? Does anyone remember Ali's character's name off the top of their head? I believe the line was in the trailer but my eyes rolled out of my goddamn head when Hugo told Alita she was ""the most human person hes known"". As for some nitpicks, why the hell did Hugo even think he could just walk up to Zalem if no one else has? Why is a murder so easily framed in a city with giant walking robots that can post a bounty on you in minutes? Why does no one seem to really react that weirdly to an URM cyborg just walking around the city? Ido's daughter's actual death was so goofy.

The CGI was great, fantastic at points, even with some of the cybernetics looking a bit off. But a handful of entertaining sequences simply can not carry the rest of this film. People are going on and on about the Motorball qualifiers scene which is just kinda cool and so pointlessly shoved in that Alita immediately dips to save Hugo. The story just felt so unnatural, like the writers desperately needed to go from one beat to the next forgoing any nuance, any emotion, and any character development. Alita going from amnesiac teenager to battle hardened bad-ass feels so jarring. She finds out Ido is a Hunter one minute and immediately becomes a hunter, goes to a hunter bar, antagonizes everyone, and then nearly kills the main big bad in the next. These are literally subsequent scenes.",aoc6mr

egdqxh3,"Haven't seen it yet, but I have a question. 

Maybe it is just me, but I have come to realize that a lot of movies that go CGI heavy often feels like the action has no ""impact"", whereas some do seem to have it.

great examples of this that come to mind are movies like Rampage or Ready Player One. I wanted to like these movies, but the action sequences just felt bland ( in the case of rampage) or they felt like you weren't supposed to actually be having fun (RP1) in the fact that they never really let you enjoy moments of action because the main character has other things on his mind, and when there was action, it felt like there was no ""umph"" to it (IMO of course) which is sad, because I was excited for this one.

Another example is Venom. The action just felt like it had no impact to me. It was just there to be flashy I felt.

A good example of the opposite (IMO) is Pacific Rim. While I wouldn't say it deserved best picture, the action felt like it packed a punch. Even if there are plot holes like why did they use a cruise ship as a sword when moments later they activate a sword weapon. The action felt like they were allowing their characters to be ""badass"" while not being flashy with no impact.

I don't know if I described it accurately, but I want to know, Does Alita's action feel impactful, or does it feel like a lot of flash with no real impact, or does it feel like the action packs a heavy punch, so to speak?",aoc6mr
ege9eku,"I saw the Film last night in 3d. It looked wonderful and had some very compelling action sequences and a rich backstory.

egl3zms,"As someone with no familiarity with the original source material, I'm feeling very 'Meh' about the movie overall. Some great stuff mixed with some real lousy stuff to create an overall product that's pretty mediocre.

Visually, it's top-level craft. It looks great, with great action.

The story and script, on the other hand, left a *lot* to be desired. There were a lot of great ideas presented, but I felt like there was a much better movie hidden among the mess we actually got. Given what I'm seeing other people say, I think it may have been a problem with the movie being *too* loyal to the source material rather than refining it for what it needed to be - *a movie*.

More importantly, a movie with a satisfactory plot that didn't suffer from ""Assumed Trilogy Syndrome"" or whatever you want to call it.

Fine, that's how it was in the original story. *But this isn't the original story*. This is a *movie adaptation*. Much like Marvel changes things from the comic stories to make them better fit the big screen, and much like there were changes to the film adaptation of Lord of the Rings, the movie adaptation for *Battle Angel* should have done more to *adapt* the story for a different format rather than try to tell as loyal a *retelling* of the original source material as possible.

Again, given what I'm reading, off the top of my head thoughts include saving her Motoball career for *potential* future movies, then put a stronger focus on the awesome robot kung fu action for this movie. Give the first movie more of a conclusive plot with hanging plot hooks and hints at what might come in the future rather than ending with what is so frustratingly obviously a ""To be continued..."" ending.

On some level, the fact that there was a lot of good elements shining through made things worse, since it made it all the more difficult for the film to cover up the deficiencies with the action, as good as that action was. The movie, as made and presented, was either too smart or too dumb for it's own good. Too smart to get away with being a move I could enjoy by turning my brain off and just enjoying the action, but too dumb to reward all the potential brilliance that was hinted at and teased but never really stuck the way it should have.

Ultimately, I don't expect to see the movie again. I have no interest in seeing the movie again. *That said*, there were enough interesting things there that if there *is* a sequel - which I only expect to happen if Cameron is passionate enough about this whole thing to put down another couple hundred million to make it happen - I will be tentatively and cautiously planning to see it in hopes of learning more about the interesting stuff that snuck through the lackluster script and that they get it right the second time around.

eh642fp,"The CGI was spectacular and the battle scenes were entertaining. However, I think the plot is weak and the dialogue is cringey at times (particularly for the love scenes).

egdj13x,"This movie was so whack, very disappointing performance from Waltz. The love interest was one of the worst performances I’ve seen in a long time. His death scene in particular made me and my friends actually laugh - his limbless robobody falling through the clouds and vanishing - I’m sorry but LOL, how can that be written in to a film.

Overall the writing was lacklustre and I couldn’t empathise or relate to a single character, it’s like the writers had never had a normal human interaction in their lives. That one-liner from the dog man after the puppy gets killed, something along the lines of ‘well he’s not a dog person’ - sorry what!? 

The CGI was fantastic for the most part,  but honestly once I got the idea of shark boy and lava girl in my head I just couldn’t stop thinking about it - the way the human faces sit on the cyborg bodies just felt super off and creepy, also very off putting that you could see more detail in Alita’s face (pores, sweat etc) compared to actual people who seemed airbrushed!

Overall I don’t think people should settle for something with over a 100 mil budget as being ‘just okay,’ they had a lot of creative control on making something original and set up an interesting world, but everything took place within the confines of the roller ball game? The penultimate time Alita enters the game, the entire tone of the film switched to a goofy family sports film where Cristoph Waltz gave his pep talk. I’m not ridiculing anyone for enjoying this because people are entitled to their opinions obviously, but I went in to this with 0 expectations and found myself shaking my head at the clunkiness and awkwardness which oozes out of the film at every chance it can.

egosi71,"Just saw this movie last night with some friends. We all agreed it was pretty terrible. For context, none of us have read the manga. Spoilers ahead.

Pros: Fight scenes are beautiful and exciting. CGI is seamless and helps show off the dystopian setting. The setting shows promise of an intriguing history, especially with the war from 300 years ago.

Con: Characters felt weak and their actions didn’t make sense. Alita flips between a naive waif to a brooding teenager on the drop of the hat. The romantic subplot was agonizingly bad, and the love interest was really stupid, especially at the end of the movie when he dies twice. A dog gets killed for no good reason, and honestly I’m still really pissed about it. Mahershala Ali’s talents were supremely wasted on his role, despite the interesting twist about him acting as two characters.

The main problem I felt was that it seems like they took a bunch of issues of the manga and try to go over each storyline, but compress it and rush through them in one movie. It’s a bit like how The Last Airbender tried to fit all of Season 1 of the TV show into the movie, and the story suffered greatly for it.

The movie wouldn’t have been nearly as bad if they had completed a full story arc, i.e. Alita finally faces off against the big bad, but instead the climax of the movie is that she kills one of his puppets and then her love interest dies due to his own stupidity. Then the movie ends with the big bad taking off his goggles in the distance and smirking.

\- gritty cyberpunk aesthetic is aight (though personally I prefer the neon cyberpunk aesthetic of GITS live-action movie, which is basically the only good thing about that movie HA) 

\- ""stop fighting now or no free repairs"" was kinda funny ",aoc6mr

I loved it i loved the special effect i loved how the 3d was done everything about this movie was great even if you do not think you will like the plot or characters or whatever you should go to see it because of the stunning spectacle. I am very impressed.

Sadly from what i read on the box office performance the general public is somewhat less impressed and that's too bad. I don't get it people keep complaining about how they want original movies and when original movie comes out they go like: I am not so sure about this let's just see another marvel flick lol.",aoc6mr
egmkfyk,didn't like it. It had no beginning and no end. Like Nova who is supposed to be the main villain had 2 minutes of screen time only if you include other people's eyes turning blue. And the Hugo love story was ridiculous. So much time was spent on him. The action was good though. ,aoc6mr

Good project choice from Cameron in terms of visuals, but the rest is meh.",aoc6mr
ej2tnif,"It's a sci-fi movie based on parts of the first 4 volumes of a 9 volume manga that first came out in 1990. There are some gaps and not adequately explained bits but that's probably the limitation of squishing parts of 4 volumes into a single movie. Even the 2 episode OVA only attempted to compress the first 2 volumes of the manga and arguably does those bits better than the recent movie since it's less content being compressed. As an older story the plot points aren't terribly fresh or deep for audiences of our time and the plot is more straightforward. There's a futuristic post-war/apocalyptic setting, ""what does it mean to be human"", ""augmented vs natural"", and a very simple love story.

&#x200B;

Nothing we've never seen before. Alita does them all well enough though though to create a visually enjoyable movie with simple but still valid messages. It's still a movie that you can enjoy even without being a fan of the originals, but it's definitely better for fans.

&#x200B;

I'm a fan of the 2 episode OVA and manga. From a fan perspective, I was happy that the story and plot was left relatively unchanged coming to Hollywood. The changes made were necessary for creating a Hollywood version: like 10x reduced blood and gore, time saving changes such as combining several successive strong minions Alita faced into one, etc. I do feel that Hugo's end was more impactful in the original though.",aoc6mr

",aoc6mr
egdewnh,"So I'm not really a fan of manga and I generally dislike anime. But I fucking loved this movie! Alita the character has got to be one of the most endearing characters I have ever seen in a movie. There is so much to love in this here: the world building, the cgi, the action, most of the characters and even a lot of the story points/lore were genuinely interesting. I have never been more sucked into a world than I have been with Iron City. I love how unlike other dystopian movies you never actually get a good look inside Zalem as its only ever seen through the ground/Alita's perspective and it just adds to the mystery. I want to see more of this world and hope we get a sequal.

Although some of the dialogue was kinda weird, Hugo's acting wasnt the best and the last part of the movie was definitely rushed I still fucking love this movie and would definitely recommend watching it. I'm also tempted to reading the manga now. Is this the first step to becoming a weeb?


Also best used of the f-bomb in a 12A rated movie.",aoc6mr
egdlzcf,"Technically Alita is amazing -- I never doubted this was a real world.

The dialog, pacing, and, in general, the writing and resulting story, on the other hand, are terrible.  Perhaps the story would be acceptable in a less technically competent movie.  I think this contrast is what will make people judge this movie unusually harshly -- that it has a beautiful exterior that builds expectations for something great but in the end it is hollow, lifeless, and often downright dumb at its core.

There is so much wrong with its narrative that I get exhausted when I consider enumerating them so I'll say that there are very few if any beats that work.  So much goes under explained while so much is over explained.  The dialog is klunky and unnatural.  Character actions and motivations are often bewildering.  Characters make dramatic shifts without any apparent motivation which leads less to character arcs and more character toggles.  It is almost as though the script notes say, ""CHARACTER CHANGES MIND HERE.""

The one big roller ball scene we get to see is aborted in favor of a chase and fight that leads nowhere.  And in a tonally jarring twist, a character who was reduced to a head on a robot body makes a really weird decision that gets them killed a second time.  The real emotional payoff of these moments were overlooked -- the fact that someone who once robbed cyborgs of their parts now has to adjust to being mostly machine.  This could have been the basis of an entire movie alone but in Alita, we have to assume this was resolved somewhere during the transition from one scene to the next.

I feel like it'd be fun to list the things wrong with the movie's story one day but at the moment I simply don't want to think about this universe anymore.

The action is fun, inventive, and surprisingly gruesome without being graphic.

I feel like the technical wizardry and acting were wasted on the awful script and direction.  In the end, the movie didn't make me feel anything other than relief that at the end I can get up and go do something more interesting.

But here's the thing: I feel like good people got together and and tried their best to make something interesting and entertaining.  I'm happy they made this effort.  Nothing about the movie seems cynical or like a cash grab. I can tell that someone loved the story.  I feel like this was a passion project and sometimes things don't go well.",aoc6mr

I'll start with the bad. The script. Jesus. Did a middle schooler write these lines? Such stilted and cliche dialogue. The character of Hugo was unnecessary and that actor lacks charisma. I would've liked to have seen more of Woltz and Connelly. 

The good- I thought the actress playing Alita was very good. The eyes yes are uncanny Valley but I embraced the weirdness. Mahershala always brings it but I wish we knew more of his story. The best thing about this film is the design. Some really beautiful shots of the city, I really liked how everything looked from the vehicles to the floating city.

If this is going to be the trend for movies going forward, I'll just stop going to cinemas. Movies are supposed to be stand-alone stories, not vehicles for episodic series with cliffhanger endings.

egd1ro0,"A lot of people will focus on the plot but my disappointment was primarily in the visual and spectacle of it all.


The tech was astounding, especially the mocap but I don't feel that it was a major leap from Avatar 10 years ago or Apes 3 3 years ago. It's still the some of the best CG I've seen but it didn't wow me.


However, the major issue is with the worldbuilding that everyone will bring up. Due to being based on a 90s manga, it felt very generic both in look and feel. Its the cliched divided society that is such a dystopian staple ever since Blade Runner. The big race was done vastly better in Ready Player One.The romance is straight-up Twlight-esque(with scene of the ""other"" watching the love interest sleep).Bruishka isnt a threat cause he keeps getting his ass handed to him every time and runs away like Team Rocket. There is not a single interesting visual gimmick or concept that felt fresh or new or really used the tech to create something even remotely breathtaking. Compared to spectacle-heavy blockbusters like Fury Road, Gravity or even Valerian - movies which had a few absolute stunners of set pieces or shots or awe-inspiring example of visual aplomb, there was nothing in Alita that made my jaw drop or made me feel that I'm seeing something new that I haven't seen before.


I challenge any fan to show me a single frame that was beautifully presented and had the kind of visual splendour you expect from a movie that's so heavily promoting its visuals. Even Avatar(closest comparison) had the dragon taming scene, the tree scenes in general with its purples and blues and the feeling of the tree. Aquaman had the Trench dive shot with the red flare, Gravity had the shuttle spinning out of control, Fury Road had the sandstorm or the assault by the bike gang and many more. Valetisn had the entire bonkers scene in the market. Pacific Rim had the Jaeger use a ship as a bat or the kaiju suddenly grow wings or the flashback scene. Edge of Tomorrow(also based on a light novel) had the initial beach assault and actual interesting sci-fi ideas that were used for a fun set pieces and a deeper view on destiny. and None of these films had any real deep plot or story but they excelled in visual imagination. It wasn't just ""look how photoreal it is"" and but more ""wow I've never seen this done before"".


Why does every fight take place in dark alleys or a hole in the ground? Everything is dark and grey and takes away from the action. It's also damning that nothing in the movie compared to thevglimpsesvif moon battles and the URM assault. Even the backstory is more interesting than the actual set pieces offered in the movie. Wheres the colours? Where're the vistas? Remember the kaiju bones temple all bathed in red that's on screen for a moment in Pacific Rim? A totally throwaway concept but it was unique and deepened the world, nothing of that sort here at all. I know, 90s manga etc. I think the only scene that wasn't mostly grey or yellow was the scavenger hunt to get the URM suit.


Technology is not a substitute for imagination. There wasn't a single concept that the movie delves into regarding cybernetics, class, cyborg love etc.No interesting gimmick that sets this world apart from any other generic dystopia it even looks cool. The movie has done much plot but does little to say about any aspect of its world and inhabitants.",aoc6mr

The CGI was actually really good. It took a while to get used to Alita's exaggerated features but eventually they felt normal. The city looked great and any hard sci-fi shots looked amazing as well. There was one instance where CGI and live action REALLY felt out of place but I've never posted here before so I'm not sure how deep into spoilers I can go.

&#x200B;

Alita herself, for the most part, was actually really endearing at the start. However I felt less and less of an attachment to her as the movie went on because she developed into a character with NO flaws. The rest of the cast were either emotionless ghosts or overacted so much that it threw the movie off.

&#x200B;

The action scenes were done fairly well but I wish there were more. The romance section of the film took up so much time that I think it actually damaged the movie.

eh18mra,"I didn’t like this movie.  I loved the setting and the colorful characters and I thought the CGI was well done considering real people are hard to fold into CGI but I really did not like this movie.

Alita herself was probably my biggest problem, she has no arc.  She starts badass with a strong moral framework, “develops” into more of a badass with a strong moral framework, and ends as a badass with a strong moral framework.  

She loses (ties) exactly 1 fight in this film, a fight prefaced by her father denying her the ultimate weapon she had found herself.  That fight was probably the only interesting fight in the movie, technically there was some doubt as to the outcome (but not really since we hadn’t gotten to see Alita really kick ass yet and what movie not named after an animal kills it’s titular character?)

All those other fights?  I think I checked out on the third fight, she not only wins these fights (of which there are too many), she perfect 64 hit combo untouchables them.  There isn’t any doubt in the viewers mind Alita isn’t going to win after the first 5 seconds, and I can really only watch the “she just a little robot gi- Ow fuck i’m dead cause i underestimated her” bit a finite number of times before I check out.

I’d talk about the story, but the story is this self affirming “alita is badass” memory unlock plot that is about as interesting as reading the bible when you just saw Jesus drop kick Satan.  It doesn’t do anything other than world building (which i love but that’s not a plot, that’s just world building).

This movie is your basic shonen (i don’t think shojo is apt because story wise shojos akin to western romances and shonens are akin to western actions films) that once again equates badass with strong when creating a strong female character.  I got very strong ready player one vibes watching this, and that’s another 2+ hour power fantasy with nothing interesting to say but an interesting world.

Mrs. Ido was a pointless character who's change of heart is inexplicable. The love angle was poorly constructed. None of the characters' motivations were well sketched out.

egqix9k,"So last week I saw Alita: Battle Angel twice.  The first time in regular IMAX 3D on Wednesday before it officially opened, (only because I wanted to avoid traffic after meeting a client; I actually did not plan to see Alita when it opened, and it was not on my ""must see"" list;) and the second time in IMAX with Laser on Sunday.  

I am not sure why Alita got only 50-ish at Rotten Tomatoes.  This movie should have gotten 90-ish, and ""The Last Jedi"" and ""Sorry to Bother You"" really deserved the 50-ish.  BTW, I have never read the manga or seen the anime. I am not a fan of any manga or anime or anything Japanese in general, except sushi and sashimi.

The IMAX 3D with Laser (my second viewing) was definitely better than regular IMAX 3D (my first viewing.) When I walked into the laser IMAX theater, the room was definitely much darker than the regular IMAX theater.  The theater was one of the darkest I have seen.  I got the perfect seating and sat right in the center and middle of the theater, (for both times with and without laser, the both times I saw Alita.)  The seating was a main reason why I chose Laser IMAX 3D over Dolby Cinema 3D: I could not get any good seating for any Dolby 3D theaters near me.  All the good Dolby 3D seats were sold out for the whole opening week.

The images for Laser IMAX 3D were much clearer and sharper than regular IMAX.  They were the clearest, sharpest images I have ever seen.  The differences in image clarity and sharpness between laser vs. regular IMAX were immediately apparent and very noticeable when the movie began.  IMO, Laser IMAX was clearer and sharper than even Dolby Cinema, (although I have not seen Alita in Dolby 3D so I cannot make a certain and direct comparison; however, I have seen other movies in Dolby 3D.)  I remember being blown away last year when I saw a movie in Dolby Cinema for the very first time, and I thought, ""whoa, holy crap! From now on I must always see big-budget AAA spectacle movies (like Avengers) in Dolby Cinema!"" On the other hand, I was never that impressed by the regular IMAX.  I had avoided regular IMAX in the past because I thought the marginal benefits were not worth the more expensive ticket prices.

From now on, I will definitely be seeing big-budget AAA spectacle movies in either Dolby Cinema or IMAX **with Laser**.

I could be wrong, but I felt the 3D effects were better in regular IMAX than laser IMAX. However, I personally prefer clearer, sharper images over better 3D gimmicks.

However, Alita was spectacular in both regular and laser IMAX. IMO, Alita is the pinnacle of CGI and SFX.  At the moment, it has *the* best CGI and SFX.  *There is no other movie that has better CGI or SFX,* and it is very apparently and obviously so.   Its CGI and SFX are *that* good, and I have seen over 100 movies in the past year, (closer to 150, courtesy of my movie subscription plans - i.e., previously MoviePass and currently AMC A-List.)  Alita is a movie that everyone must see on a big screen in a theater, preferably in Dolby Cinema or IMAX.

A final note: my biggest problem with laser IMAX 3D was the glasses: IMO the glasses for Dolby 3D and regular IMAX felt more comfortable. The glasses for laser IMAX 3D was big and square, and they had a very thick frame.  When I put on the glasses, I could see the edges (the inner and bottom edges) of the frame, which slightly distracted me from what was on the screen at first, (although the distraction went away when I got into the movie later.)  I am not sure why the laser and regular IMAX used different glasses, but IMAX seriously needs to fix the problem with the glasses for laser 3D.  (I thought all 3D formats could use the same glasses, and I read that I could even bring my own glasses if I did not like theirs; maybe what I read was incorrect.)

eig0o5d,"I went to this movie because a friend of mine was a stunt double for the motorball scenes. I didn't have any previous knowledge of the series so I went in with a pretty blank slate. I thought the movie was absolutely awful.

The narrative could not focus for the life of it, none of the characters were fully fleshed out (Alita and Dr. Ido are close but still come up short), and the romantic storyline felt so inorganic and followed the ""Born Sexy Yesterday"" trope to the letter.

The production design and effects were great (and I of course enjoyed the motorball scenes) but they were wasted on a miserable and confusing screenplay with the attention span of a squirrel.

I'd personally put this movie on the shelf right next to Valerian.",aoc6mr

But, the love story is too YA, I do not mind that if it is executed well but it is not and bothers me. The boy is the worst and does not have chemistry with Alita. Even his performance is worst than Nyssiana (Eiza González) who only appeared in one scene. I feel like this make T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and Nakia (Lupita Nyongo) love story in Black Panther looks like a masterpiece.

Which is why Edward Norton only has a cameo. The thing is, as much as I liked the movie. It fed me with so much information that it was really hard to process. I feel by the time the next one comes out, I would have lost touch and forgotten all of the information from this movie. Too many subplots that didn't exactly have a contribution to the overall storyline. Jennifer Connelly's character literally does nothing significant (Im still not sure what exactly what she there for). Mahershala Ali is underused as well. The saving grace of the movie is definitely Christoph Waltz and Roza Salazar.

egl4hap,"Although I didn't read the manga, I saw the OVA, and I wish this movie had stuck closer to that.  Hugo's role was awful all around, but in the OVA there are several elements that made it better.

[For one, the romantic feelings are essentially unrequited.  Alita obsesses over him but he's even almost put off as he focuses solely on getting to Zalem.  It really makes Alita seem weird but in a more endearing way than the movie's ""take my heart"" scene.  There was very little buildup for that first kiss, but in the OVA it's more compelling because she forces herself on him.](#spoiler)  I'd rather have had those intensely yet honestly flawed characters than the awkwardness we got.

Luckily, things picked up in the second half, and the CGI was out of this fucking world along with a lot of action.  One of my biggest gripes with films is how terribly boring the action can be even with high budgets and how little rewatch value it has, whereas plenty of anime tickles the imagination with crazy sakuga.

The second biggest sin of the producers was creating the win-the-game-go-upstairs reward, which was very out of place, made the movie seem even more incomplete and removed the original reason alita had for turning to motorball - it was to find herself in battle, while seperating from Ido and her previous life as a hunter-warrior.

I mean it's visually cool with distinct character designs and locale(kind of made me wishful for a Deus Ex movie). The action and choreography is also pretty good with the Kung Fu. Jennifer Connelly is also still hot especially in the scene where she's lying in bed with stockings and another scene where she has on a tight shirt.

The story though... first half hour was straight up exposition dumps. I have no idea what Vector's motivation was as a villain. Chiren's actions also make no sense later on in the movie. Why the hell did she have a change of her heart with helping Alita rescue Hugo when the whole she  was obsessed with getting back to Zalem even if it meant killing her? This bothered me the most and makes me feel like a scene was cut that led to the heel turn. Dialogue is cringey at times. Another thing is what happened to the motorball game after Alita went to the church?

Biggest issue was the lack of character development for Alita. There were so many directions you could go with her regarding her nativity,  belligerence, or learning to be human again. Nope you get none of that.  She just wants to fuck the first human boy she makes contact with and  kind of wants to regain her memories. Honestly she's pretty much a Mary Sue character.

Everything comes easy to Alita aside from maybe one fight(where she's still able to punch out Grewishka's eye with one arm). She's also never wrong(she knows better than Ido especially with getting that upgraded body she desired)  and beautiful according to Chiren. In her shallow relationship with Hugo, she's always the one who's right and is an amazing girlfriend who will sacrifice anything to please him.

I found the story decent, nothing great or anything, and the CGI was fine.    

Good lord though the dialogue in this movie was so stupid. She has so many ridiculous one-liners and the romance was terrible. I enjoyed the character Alita and the doctor, but there were lots of characters I didn’t really care about.

I mean just pay attention only to Hugo in this movie. Every new scene he is in he's making some drastic life choice based on a minor development that just happened. The movie skips all the hard work of making you connect to a character so you care about their life changing drastically.

Finally, I agree with critics who said this movie spends too much time setting up sequels.

The good: Special effects, CGI, choreography were all great. The fights were fantastic and Chistoph Waltz was spot on as Ido.  The soundtrack was fine and even good at times. I liked that [Nova was introduced and the way that he was introduced. I also liked some of the other warrior hunters got some decent characterization](#spoiler).  

The bad: pacing was very uneven, even jarring. Characterization was too westernized for my taste. Plot holes. Dialogue was really fucking cheesy at points. The city is too clean, and it feels like the whole thing is a Disney version of cyberpunk.

They should've made Alita look more human to make her more marketable to the general audience, even in the manga those eyes are just anime eyes to me.

Edit: I really want to see these adaptations succeed. They were able to do it for comic books, why not video games and anime. They just need to do it right; either make something new with the spirit of the anime intact or stop trying to cram a bunch of stories into a 2 hour movie and just concentrate on 1 or 2 arcs with a cohesive story.

The mix between photorealistic rendering on some characters and like unreal engine crap on others. The hybrid cgi/reality work was really good at some times and terribly at others.

What it did well:

* Holy Shit-balls the action was amazing! If you're a fan of sci-fi action grab your coat and see this film. The scenes are visually stunning and will keep you engaged. Some of the villains look really cool and it never gets tired watching Alita in action.
* The actors did a good job. I think each person suited their role.
* The story is well paced and didn't bore me.
*  Christoph Waltz was amazing and his character had the best character development of the whole cast.
* I love Rosa Salazar in the role.

Unfortunately, my list of positives ends here. I'm not familiar with the franchise and so can only comment on what I thought of the movie. 

My negatives:

* The pacing was so slow in the begining as they struggled to set up all the backstories and plot points (which I will get to in a moment). This really dragged it down and got in the way of Anita learning about the world around her. The pacing did pick up eventually though - so this is a minor nitpick.
* The story was okay but it was dragged down by Motorball and some really flat character interactions. Alita had absolutely nothing to offer Hugo and he was blander than my oatmeal each morning. Also, why bother saving him if you're just going to have him killed off in the most stupid way minutes late? Seems like an odd narrative choice. Having said this, I didn't hate the story and found it serviceable.... Until the very end. The ending just made no sense. She fights all this way to get through to Vector and speak to Novas but then we find out nothing about him (apart from he takes human parts - How is this different to what Hugo was doing?). I assume Novas does something more evil than this, but no clue as to what that could actually be. What does she actually achieve with this final showdown in the film? She kills Vector but Novas is very much in control. She doesn't even help Chiren. She basically just vanadlises a whole lot of things, murders someone and then leaves.  Then Hugo get's himself killed doing something that makes no sense and Alita goes back to playing Motorball (like what?! Why?! To get to Zalem. Would Novas really just let her back even if she became final champion?) She also wants to run away with Hugo, despite the fact that she is drawn to battle. I suppose you could argue she was tired of etc. but this was never explored it just seems entirely out of character. Which brings me to my next (and final) negative point...
* While I loved Rosa Salazar (I've been following her career since she was in College Humour), I can honestly say Alita had the worst character development of any of the characters on screen. They set up some interesting ideas  (""Am I human?"", ""Can a human love a cyborg?"", Hugo's body part trafficking and whether being a warrior is all she is) and never went anywhere with it, always resolving the ideas within a few seconds of them being introduced (or just never doing anything with them at all). She never have to learn anything. There is a moment where she gets her ass handed to her ( almost literally) and rather than learn an important lesson, she just gets a faster and stronger body. There was no introspection or inner growth.  She was just a great warrior to start with, she was always compassionate and it culminates in a line that would only make sense if she took some sort of journey to get there. Spoiler Alert. It doesn't (""And I'm just an insignificant girl"" - Like, what was the significance of that line? She only mentions something similar once when she realised she was from Zalem and states that she wonders if she was thrown out with the rest of the rubbish. This is in no way explored in any depth. She literally never questions herself after this). Tanji (a friend of Hugo's and a side character had more development than her). Chiren had more character development than her. Hugo had more development than her.

I know it seems like a rant but I would give the film about 6/10 still. I hope someone can shine some light on these for me as I really wanted to enjoy the film. The ending just made no sense.",aoc6mr

The big problem is that the main character, Alita, is a massive Mary-Sue. she fumbles twice early on in the beginning sequence where she's learning the ropes of the street version of murderball (or whatever the sport was called) in entirely cute ways deliberately designed to make her endearing, and then the third time [where she is sliced up by one of the big bad's henchmen, carved up but conveniently clean sliced so none of her original body as found at the start is destroyed, which happens shortly after she finds a replacement body and is categorically told by her mechanic father-figure that there's no way he's putting her in that new body. Her old body was meant for said father figures actual daughter and it's destruction yields no response at all from him.](#spoiler) Everything else goes flawlessly, she never gets hit until near the end, shrugs that off aimlessly, and is basically shilled for as amazing by nigh everyone.

It's also really obvious that the story has been rushed to fit the film. Things that should get reactions and emotive beats aren't addressed, whole sequences come up and go as soon as they come up only to never be referenced again, which works fine in an episodic format, but doesn't work in a movie. things that would've got 22 minutes to be explored in an anime, are crammed into a seven minute scene, and nowhere is that more evident than Alita's first and only trip outside the city, where she has no reaction to seeing something other than the city, or what she finds out there.

And then there's the wholly unsatisfying ending.

egpsqbm,"Finally was able to see it and posted my review for it.

Upfront, I have never seen the Anime or Manga associated with this, but I knew it was an anime adaption so I had really really low expectations especially after the incredible mishap that was Scarjo in the Shell.

The movie was well, ok in a broad sense. It wasn't really boring, or exciting either. Much of the movie plays well enough to draw you in and watch it as much as any Transformers, or Marvel Cinematic Universe film will. It doesn't really harbor anything special in it that makes it unique against the flurry of Hollywood seat fillers that are being released right now(Other than being an anime adaption). And that may partially be part of the problem I have with this film. It played so much of it safe as to not ward off it's potential American audience.

There is a lot of attempts at ""anime-ism"" in the film that are glazed over with American live action acceptable influence and behavior. A lot of very run of the mill behavior and acting from basically everyone in the show that reminds me a little bit more of movies like HellBoy (2004), Pacific Rim, and the Sam Rami Spiderman films than it does anything else.

One of these is the big anime eyes on Alita herself. Big Anime eyes in anime are done specifically for emoting and expression in animation, and much of this film is CG animation, but the film does very little to take any advantage of it at all. It pretty much missed the whole point of big eyes in the first place, so it looks really out of place and is really distracting for really no reason at all. It's unnecessary, and if it weren't for many of the other Human faces pasted on CG bodies, it'd just be really out of place. 

 It had the potential to go the whole way but it was so afraid of doing so that it just sold it self short on what it could have done. They could have done the anime to Live action translation well but then they seemed like they decided not too.

The movie's first Half is really good at setting up what feels like will be a complete film, but by the 2/3rd of the movie it becomes super obvious that they want to make a series out of it and the sequel setup becomes irritatingly obvious, only to slap on a hastily done wrap up at the end.

I will say one thing, they recreated a scene from the anime, that I actually had no idea was part of the anime. It was a scene used in a fan anime comedy film called AMV Hell 3, and I'm actually impressed how incredibly well done the scene was. The fact that I was able to recognize that was really good, and scores brownie points with me personally.

The music is forgettable, and the sequel setup, and safety glaze over the film really just took away how great the film could have been, and that's really where almost all of the films faults really lie. It could have been really good had they not tried so hard to be safe. 

I'm giving Alita: Battle Angel a 5 out of 10.

ehb649s,"Glad to find a thread with more critical-minded fellow viewers. While I enjoyed the movie, I think it suffers from a severe case of overestimation, stemming from a lack of willingness from the audience to nitpick crucial elements that sabotage the story, such as... I dunno... the stupid romance? Some on-the-nose dialogue, not to mention cheesy and cliche.

&#x200B;

The one thing about this movie I literally have zero issues with is the visuals, world, action choreography, and Alita's mo-cap actress. These are flawless. Where the movie falls apart is the script, dialogue, character, and suspension of disbelief.

&#x200B;

Alita's personal motivation to hunt down Nova is rooted in a childish relationship that is meant to be taken as beautiful, and I'm purposefully using the words ""meant to be taken"" as I've heard some who claim that its childish nature is by design. I care to disagree. Whoever wrote the script clearly intended for the audience to fall for this romance as evident in the two sides' mawkish gestures and dialogue, i.e. Alita literally giving Hugo her heart in order to save him, or Hugo's cheese of all cheese: ""You're the most human person I know.""

Also, this movie didn't get criticize like the stupid movie Scarlett Johannson did about the cyborg.

Felt like the Doctor and Alita's relationship wasn't necessarily great. Didn't feel much chemistry between them. Also his presence didn't seem important to the movie. He would appear in important scenes and his actions were significant as well, but his character didn't seem to leave an impact in the movie. But I love his ""no more free repairs(?)"" quote during the bar fight scene though.

It also seemed like Alita's had multiple goals scattered throughout the movie and they were completed rather quickly. Sorry to the Japanese manga/anime fans, but I believe if this movie was not based on a manga, I don't think this would have as much 8/10 ratings as it does.  ",aoc6mr

It seemed everyone's understanding of The Fall was wrong and Alita was remembering something about taking down Zalem, the last of the floating cities. Like these floating cities were everywhere on Earth and they were trying to take them down to end the oppression and suffering, but ultimately failed. Is Nova the only thing ""living"" in Zalem and is it just a AI overlord? Or is it an actual place with elitist people living in it, like Elysium?

The only thing lacking for me was the story.  I'm not aware of the manga, but I felt underwhelmed at the end.

Like the whole movie you point at this villian and they're on different cities and never go toe to toe?  Her character arc felt like it was incomplete.  Why not make this a tv show?  If you're making it a film, then you need to have at least a half decent villian for the hero to overcome and the Vector character wasn't enough.

And if it's because she was a Martian, why don't the other humans recognize it as a weird trait? Hugo was not a convincing character and I didn't really like the actor's portrayal of him.

The graphics, visual effects, cinematography, sound editing, and Alita and Ido's actors did a great job. I'd rate it about a 65/100 for me. So a little better than the RT aggregate but definitely not amazing.

I am one of the many people who have waited to see this project finished ever since James Cameron announced his involvement. We can all agree that this movie (even though is a good movie) is not nearly as amazing as it would have been had James Cameron directed it himself.

That been said, the adaptation of the manga as well as the special effects , put together by JC himself and his groundbreaking CGI company, are astonishing.

However the unnecessary and rather tacky changes come from Rodriguez attachment of the film. 

For example the place where Alita duels in the Manga: ‘Iron City’, is a world of scavengers, crime and constant struggle. A run-down environment made out of the disposals from the top city of Zalem. This background is important since it justifies why the people there (Hugo, Chiren) want to make it up to Zalem so badly.

In the film the place was transformed into a Mexican villa, the whole architecture, street food stands, and people walking around in the sunny streets looking exactly like tourists. 

Other distasteful aspects in my opinion consist of 

The villain Zapan having an Aztec calendar covering his back.

Filling the entire bar (turned into a cantina) fight scene filled with Mexican outlaws, rather than the mirage of actual bounty hunter characters from the same scene in the Manga. 

All this tackiness comes from Rodriguez involvement in the film, which in my opinion diminishes both the great ground work of Cameron as well as Yukito Kishiro’s masterpiece. 

I am interested to know what you redditors feel about this Mexican-washing changes and how you perceived the movie.

When the live action GITS came out, it was a bust before it even debuted because of the internets accusations of white washing, but at least it had Beat Takeshi and Kaori Momoi in big roles. In Alita, the heroine is done completely in CGI as to curtail having to actually hire any Asian talent, and so we're forced to watch Waltz walk and talk with someone we can tell is not really there just by the way he ""looks"" at her. 

I try not to come off as a film snob but I absolutely hated every inch of this movie from minute one. It's at its worst whenever Yugo is on screen or Ido is engaging with Alita. It's completely devoid of the gritty violence of Gunm and feels like a Transformers movie but for an even younger target audience.  I'm dumbfounded that this was over a decade in the making when it looks so slapped together. Like where did all that money go? Even the extras look like they showed up to set with whatever they wore from home.

Hollywood is so desperate to get people off their couch and back to the theaters that they're rebooting shit from the 90s (that isn't even from their side of the planet) and expecting it to work in the 2010's. Every single opening trailer for this movie was a remake or a reboot or a sequel of something that hasn't been hit for over a decade and I should have regarded it as a sign of what was to come.

eh2ugui,"As soon as I watched it, I couldn't wait to get home and go on the official discussion thread and start bashing it. After reading everyone's positive reception, I'll at least make an effort to outline what I didn't like. I suck at writing down what I think so bear with me

* The plot was so glaringly obvious. From the second every character appears you know exactly what they're going to do.

* The pacing was so so so off. Everything felt rushed and sluggish at the same time

* The characters. Oh my God the characters. Calling them one dimensional would be a compliment.

* The movie was basically as bad as Fantastic beasts two, they're both excruciating teases for the next movie in the franchise

The while movie felt as sloppy as a low budget B grade movie. It was completely forgettable. It made me question if I disliked movies entirely. The only saving Grace was the action. The CGI was not bad but it could have been better.

ehrt40i,"Saw this in IMAX 3D yesterday. First time in IMAX, really liked the experience for movies in general. Regarding this particular one, was painful to watch.  **I'm going to point out my opinion, and it represents only my opinion, no hate.** Also regarding the actors, I'm not jugding if they are bad or good, sometimes the material it's not good to work with or the edition of the movie isn't. Some of those actors I've seen doing great stuff. Here everyone is just bland, and Alita during scenes with Hugo is, alongside with him, just very very fake and emotionally distant.

The special effects were not as great as people are saying, sometimes on point, others (more often than not) missing big time. All the scenes between Hugo and Alita were very difficult to watch.
The pacing in general and the motives of the characters were not well explained, or transmitted by the actors. There are a lot of questions about why some characters did something, and the answer is always the same: because the movie needs that action to go on. 

Was not invested in the characters, I really didn't care much about anyone. And what's the deal with those great plans? Every time something important, as for example the first scene where he picks up Alita in the dump, we get a big plan and an over the top music. We get it, it's important, no need to scream it in the screen.
 [Why are they losing time with bullshit talk about her heart being a dark matter reactor, but when the question is why the city floats the answer is: Engineering??? Why do people love so much that sport? They didn't introduce it right,  it didn't establish an emotional response, but the effects in those scenes, especially audio ones were very good.](#spoiler)

How does this kind of movie gets a release with so many scenes lacking substance, and in many cases serious flaws in actions or effects? 
Some examples: [the mark on the forehead for the woman was not consistent, some times it looked like a sticker. One scene has one of the tubes suddenly appear on the screen when it was not there before. Some dubbing was really unfortunate in some scenes. How did Alita body was cut in pieces when she dodged every one of the claws except for one that hit in the shoulder? The people cheering in the games, what the hell are you doing? Why do they arrive at a game in the middle of it? Who the hell goes to talk to a friend about quitting doing shit in the middle of it, why didn't he talk at home? Why did Hugo friend ask for his cut before finishing the job, just so he can ask about telling Alita? Why didn't they jump the defence ring during the war? Also, why didn't Alita just didn't tell Hugo about the ring instead of losing so much time? Why did his arm break? Why didn't she hold him with her legs or some shit, since she was incredibly strong and agile? That vector guy, he ran the factory or the game, or everything? in the scene where the lady cuts Hugo head, why did she come from the front door after that, where did she came from in the first place? couldn't she go out in the same place, or wait 5 min? ](#spoiler)And many more problems with it, this is just a short list. 

**Bottom line is (TL/DR):** bland characters, no emotional connection, pacing issues, serious plot issues, the world didn't feel a living real world, seemed always fake, and limited. characters motives are non-existent. For people that are seeing this without the manga, they didn't do a good job making the world and the story breath.

Besides all this, the world in itself appears to have a fundamental flaw: [No one can get to Zalem, no one. Unless you are a champion. Well, being a professional of some sport, as we all know, is very rare, being champions is even rarer. So sooner or later people have to realize that they are not working for any reward.](#spoiler)

When you have a world with this kind of dystopia, there are always methods to keep people engaged in the illusion of belonging into the high society. Some examples are:

* The island: has a lottery which people look forward too, and everyone has access to.
* Black Mirror Fifteen Million Merits: a ticket to Hot Shot, a reality contest.

[In the Alita world, there is nothing people can do, so sooner or later they have to realize that Zalem people don't go to earth and the only thing that prevents them to fight for their rights are some robots that Hunter-warriors can defeat, and a few chips in the head that some people can extract. Like the monarchy system, eventually, people need to stand up against it.] (#spoiler)",aoc6mr

egf40zq,"Just came back from seeing it and I have to say, it has one of the worst scripts I've ever seen on screen.

Filled to the brim with bad dialogue, cliches and the story is pieced together, just like the cyborgs, from scraps seen in way better films.

There's a shit load of exposition every few minutes explaining something, like the audience is made up of people with short term memory loss and the characters make some of the dumbest decisions ever time and time again.

The biggest one is hands down when Alita goes to rescue Hugo, only to let him get stabbed by Zapan after telling him she'll kill him if he touches Hugo again.

She basically stood there because the dumb script required her to do so in order for her to ""save"" his life a few minutes later.

Then Hugo gets infected with the same dumb decision making and decides to go to Zalem on his own because there had to be a forbidden love in this movie. Not to mention that their romance was something straight out of the Disney Channel.

And for all the exposition, they didn't explain how Alita's brain remained intact for 300 years, how she could eat ( where the hell does the food go and how is it digested?), how she could breathe, because you see her without the shell and there was nothing resembling a pair of lungs in there.

It was cool to see Alita being unapologetic about her set of skills but she did come off as a psycho and a stage 5 clinger in certain scenes. There was also quite a lot of uncanny valley due to her eyes, which was distracting at times.

Another thing was the unintentional humor, like when Ido goes hunting for cyborgs and Alita follows him. The guy takes this huge pick axe with a reactor at the back and hides behind a wall.

I thought I was watching a Looney Tunes episode. There was 0 practicality about that weapon and you'd never believe an old fart like him, let alone one who's a freakin' engineer, would be able to collect bounties that way. I get it that it's a manga and anime thing to have big weapons, but sometimes those things don't translate so well on screen.

They did it right in Edge of Tomorrow, though, so it can be be successful if you know how to use it in the character's favor.

Vector's death was the most hilarious thing in the film, hands down. Alita stabs him and Nova says "" Seems to be a fatal wound."", then casually drops to the floor. Comedy gold, I swear.

I have no expectations from films and take them as they are while I watch them, but for such a big project like this was, it's embarrassing they went into production with such a lazy and boring script.

The film had like 3 endings and by the time it gets to the real one, it's so bland that I didn't care one bit.

Only things it has going for it are the CGI and two action scenes (Motorball and her going into the building to hack the robots, then get to Vector), which overall had a tendency to become repetitive after a while.

I'd be interested in reading some of the manga or watching the anime, but the style in which the characters are drawn isn't particularly my cup of tea when it comes to anime. However, if the story is worth it, then I'll give it a shot.

Somebody said you can play the notes, but not the music.  That's this movie. They took the already completely inferior anime and botched it further.

ei2m58y,"I thought it was just average. The two things that bothered me the most about the movie is 1: there is so much exposition in this movie. 2. while I like Alita as a main character, the fact that everything and I mean EVERYTHING about her is CGI makes her stick out so much more. Especially when she's interacting with the live action characters like Ido or Hugo. 

Even the action was very average IMO. there were a few cool moments during the fighting scenes that felt cool and brutal. 

Oh, and the fact that this movie is PG13 whereas the manga is R rated is just lame. They could have gone the extra mile and make it rated R, but since the movie has to make money (which at this moment it's not really making all that much) they have to make it pg13.

It just rips through each scene and I never once felt connected to the characters or the world they inhabited. The visuals are often great to look at, but without a compelling story it’s not enough. 

Robert Rodriguez is a talented filmmaker, but I would not put him anywhere close to the level of James Cameron.

Despite all that I haven't laughed this hard in a movie theater since the recent Predator reboot.

In the anime, Dr. Ido is the one that finds Chiren in the suitcase in Vector’s office. He then fights Vector with his rocket axe. Wish we saw something like that in the movie. Maybe Vector gets the upper hand and is about to use his blow torch gun on Dr. Ido, when Alita appears for the save. Kind of a wasted opportunity.",aoc6mr

egikk5o,"It's almost always a terrible romantic subplot when the two characters fall in love at their first meeting, and end the movie still in love. All with little change in how they feel about one another. The dialogue and acting in their scenes together were like something out of a cliche disney channel movie. And there weren't enough interesting relationship dynamics and progression. 

Maybe have Hugo be more disinterested or aloof in the beginning, while Alita (being new to the world, and ""all or nothing"" as she put it) can't handle her emotions. And over time Hugo becomes more like-able and makes sacrifices for Alita, while Alita becomes more independent and in control of her feelings. You only saw a bit of that with the ""I'd give you my heart scene"" which was IMO the only interesting character moment between the two of them. This movie needed more weird and quirky elements like that. ",aoc6mr

egjfkrf,"I felt like that scene was the only good part of the romance, because it showcased one of her major character flaws: overextending herself in grand gestures.

It's *supposed* to be cringy, because she's immature and socially ignorant.",aoc6mr

I just can't believe that they made him the emotional core of the whole movie. I could tolerate him at first when it looked like he was just some minor character who exists to spout exposition to the amnesiac protagonist, but once it becomes clear that his role was much larger and was actually the KEY to developing Alita (not to mention being in the center of the movie's hilarious climax) his scenes suddenly became more and more unbearable.

Also, WTF was the point of dedicating a whole plot point to saving his pathetic life when he dies in the end anyway!? And nobody give me that 'it becomes important in the sequel' BS.

I don't agree on everything you wrote (Hugo especially, but that seems to be the hill I'll die on, the more I read others opinions), but I loved to read it and think it gives a very much perfect picture of the movie I just watched.

Take this review as a script and turn it into a video review. There aren't enough of those around. Good ones I mean.

As someone who defends Pacific Rim constantly by the fact that it's cheesy plot beats and characterizations fit the style of mecha manga that it's clearly trying to recreate, I understand where you are coming from.

I didn't like most things about the movie but I can see how it plays into the dated feel of the source material itself. My only problem is that it never offered something that mixed its temporal mishmash into something that feels new and unique. Like how Stranger Things has a generic bad boyfriend character but also subverts him by making him a good guy or Pacific Rim melding many super beast archetypes into a wholly original constantly mutating kaiju.Or how Speed Racer feels very much like an anime but the source anime never had the movies manic pacing or garnish-to-the-point-of-crayon-box colour palette. Alita felt very 90s but also felt slavish so.

At that point something feeling dated just feels dated and nothing more, it doesn't feel like a remix of an old hack but old hack presented as an old hack.",aoc6mr

Ah, yeah! I forgot that word existed. Nice.

I saw it in 3D with a friend. The 3D projector thing wasn't working, had to walk outside, talk to an employee, they fixed it. Okay.

I really liked how this was a cyberpunk post-apocalyptic future dense city that wasn't a complete dystopia. I mean, it looked cozy and comfy. I loved how so much of the buildings looked like that great worn down Mediterranean style.

I liked a bit of the story flow in the later part of the movie. Alita is doing Motorball stuff and Disney Channel BF is doing his stuff, but both little plotlines merge together.

2. Parts of the the ship were scavenged ('Salvagers have jacked some stuff over the years for metal, but it's all URM technology so it's *mostly* been left alone). Tanji says, 'It's pretty hard to sell this stuff..' not that it's impossible, people in the much more technically advanced Zalem (and for sure Nova) would pay good money for that URM heart, so I don't think Hugo was telling a lie to make Alita feel special. 


>1. If you're asking why she wasn't banned from Motorball after leaving mid-race. Motorball is the only source of mass entertainment in Iron City really, Alita became a big star when her tryout was so exciting (you can hear the announcer hyping it up). The people running Motorball don't seem to be the type who care about rules, they care about the game being exciting for the masses and it would have been obvious that Alita was being set up anyway. Also Vector is out of the picture and it looks like Nova gave up trying to kill her ('permission to live' and all that)
2. You mean Grewishka? He never made Final Champion as far as I know, which would send you up to Zalem (Nova probably had more use for him on the ground).
3. I don't think it was clear whose kill it was yet, when Alita was holding Hugo's head the centurions thought he was already dead so she had claimed the kill. I think that rule means once a HW has killed someone, you can't go stealing it off them (or something like that).

So, the task was to make the movie 2 hours long, with an hour of source material essentially.  They took stuff in the future parts of the manga (motorball, for once), and adjusted some of the parts with the villains.

While I loved this movie it'll probably flop because it has that same problem *Pacific Rim* had with being made for a niche audience but with a budget for a worldwide one. Once the money doesn't roll in, execs will be really hesitant to fork up the cash for the future installments that are implied by the ending. I wish we could get more payoff for ambition and passion in films like this.

I thought Rosa Salazar and Christoph Waltz were great, but Keean Johnson as Hugo was extremely weak. I never found him believable, and it didn’t help that a good bulk of his dialogue was just exposition.

In terms of the plot, I think mashing the several arcs together actually made the film feel underdeveloped and disjointed. What Zapan is doing honestly felt unrelated to what Vector is doing, and it ends up making the climax feel like a result of coincidence. And because these plots are taking up real estate with a 2-hour time span, they ‘re essentially vying with each other for screen time that could’ve developed them more.

Regarding Yugo... I mostly agree, but in a sense, I felt like he was a *better* person in the manga (and probably the anime too). In the movie, he's just a punk kid whose dream it is to go to Zalem, so instead of going the legal way of becoming the motorball champion, he immediately turns to a life of crime to make enough money. In the anime, that alternative doesn't exist, money is the *only* option. Also, movie Yugo has a motorbike, plays pseudo-street-motorball, has time for girls, takes Alita to cool places, spends money on motorball tickets and chocolate. Manga Yugo is fucking *obsessed*, he's always on the move, rushing to his next job, and if you look at his clothes, it's clear he doesn't have the money to waste on frivolous things. It's clear that he's only a criminal because there's no way he'd make all that money legally, while movie Yugo could make a lot more by just not being so wasteful.

Yet in Alita we have something truly original, something brimming with creativity and keen attention to detail. Alita and films just like it can inspire a whole new generation of blockbusters.

GitS by contrast was mind boggling - Kusanagi was completely overwritten as a character, and the increasingly relevant conflict/story/antagonist was overwritten in favour of an entirely played out corporate bad guy trope.

I mean... Scarlett Johansson is fine as the actress - she's played characters like Motoko Kusanagi from the manga before - confident, bad ass, feminine, powerful. That's her Black Widow character.

But in this she was directed to be robotic and confused. Why? So you could advance a plot about experimental cyborgs that sources its participants unethically? Why couldn't the setting be like it was in the manga? Cyborgs are a known quantity; well developed and proven military technology that are just super-expensive.

Sorry... I know this was a tangent, but the GitS adaptation still rankles me. I can only hope that other anime to movie adaptations are as thoughtful as this one.

But as for why she thought she needed help to fight Grewishka, that's a mystery to me. She handled him pretty easily in their first encounter. She didn't know what he'd gotten an upgrade, so I don't know why she wouldn't think she'd be able to handle him herself.

In the ending scene with Alita in the locker room and when she goes on to the final motorball game, we see a more mature and driven Alita. In the locker room we see that Alita is still broken by the death of Hugo, but strong driven because of it. And we see that she has not given up fighting for justice for Hugo when she raises her blade towards Nova.

On the topic of villains, Zepan is a simple evil power that is childish, driven by nothing but money and revenge, and dishonorable in every way. He deserved more depth as a main villain and was a pretty basic plot device that needed to be improved upon.

Gruishka is a villain with decent depth; we see that he is a force of pure, merciless evil that genuinely enjoys doing evil and working towards the destruction of good. He had some background that we get from the underworld battle scene, he had reason to fight for the evil forces that saved him. All in all a well rounded villain. 

Hugo though, he is a character that was somewhat evil, wanted to be good, and then had a reason to be good when he fell in love with Alita. He was a bit generic on the boyfriend part but he had a decent depth to him as a character because of his internal conflict of good and evil. Im not sure if he deserved to die though, because he had chosen to be good at the end, and was still killed for a rather poor plot advance and a decent character arc for Alita. It would have been better if he died saving Alita, it would be a good way to kill him because it would have showed his character arc of being truly good.",aoc6mr

The source material Hugo is a conflicted individual. Obsessed with getting away from Iron City (the world building of the movie, whilst detailed, was not as bleak as it should be. Iron City is a shithole) and trafficking more than the cyborg extremities - he's a real organ trafficker. 

If Alita was a generic cyborg then he'd probably scrap her if the order came in as well, but she's connected to Zarlem - his dream - and therefore different. She's also discarded from Zarlem, almost as a way to show Hugo the path out of his obsession, but he didn't see it - hence the tragedy part.

And you can even empathize with him attacking cyborgs and stripping them down for parts for his end goal of reaching a better place, Zalem.

But. My man. He gets a bounty on his head from the Zalem factory and killed-ish by the bounty hunters, then revived into a cyborg. Then 20 minutes later he’s like, “hey, you know that city that employs the factory people that attacked me and are trying to kill my love interest?

Additionally, they toned down Hugo’s desperation to go to Zalem and turned his focus out on developing a relationship with Alita, when in the manga/OVA he was only obsessed with getting to Zalem in any way he can and only mentally lost it and tried climbing up when found out he was lied to by Vector and it costed him his human body. Things like that contextualize the erratic and questionable actions of characters and they make more sense. ",aoc6mr
egnw3jl,"She finds out its a set up just before it starts, but  participates anyways. But why? At this point in the story she doesn't  have a good reason to compete, it just got suggested by Hugo in the  previous scene as a way to make money. 

*Because she knew she would win, she likes fighting, and she said fighting is the only way to help her know who she is. It was already explained the Berserker body is the  most powerful weapon there is, that she seeks out combat, and that Alita learns about herself in combat. She also still wanted the money. These things were directly said in the movie.*

The movie kinda feels  like short vignettes strung together, likely a result of the manga  source material its based on. Like, now let's have an alley fight, now  let's explore a spaceship, now let's have a bar fight, etc. That might  have worked, but it still needed a consistent thrust to the plot. Our  protagonists do not want a single, consistent thing throughout the movie  (except Hugo, I'll get to him) so as a result, our protagonists feel  very passive in the plot. The villains want Alita, but its not  particularly clear why - to get her heart, for some reason? Or her body?  Or to just kill her because she's dangerous? Or to get revenge? It's  not clear, and that's a problem.

*Alita's underlying goal was to find out who she was. She learns this through combat. I can see why a plot of self-realization may seem a bit hazy, but this is the underlying theme of the manga, too. That theme actually continues over years of publication.*

His arc ends like halfway through the movie, when he gives Alita her new body after the second fight with Grewishka thus accepting her independent will to be a warrior,  but it's not really clear why that change occurred in him. And then  after that point, the movie don't really have anything left for the  character to do. We don't even see him react to the other major events  that occur.

*It' obvious why the change occurred in him. Because if Alita was not properly constructed, she would continue getting into fights with a body that wasn't suited for it, and she may die. Ido sees she has a good and caring heart and fights for others, so he trusted Alita with the Berserker body. This is readily apparent in the movie in the sequence of events.*

*Ido reconstructed Hugo after his body died. He was serving as a comforting father for Alita. Nobody else would do it, because Hugo's being alive was illegal at that point. That was something to do.*

Hugo  runs off and gets himself killed again and it's bizarre for how  unwarranted it feels. It is such an unforced error. It is clearly  supposed to be the final big emotional hit to end the movie with, but it  falls totally flat.

*Hugo explained why he was leaving. There was a bounty on his head because Zapan framed him. And if he's still alive, Alita will be punished for not actually killing him, yet collecting a bounty. That was clear from the sequence of events. This setup is different from the manga, but it's not confusing. It actually makes more sense than Hugo believing he can hide forever in Iron City and have any kind of life.*

Other  characters have their own problems. Alita feels very passive in her own  story, and she doesn't have a clear motivation until near the end of  the movie. The motivations of Vector and Grewishka and Zapan are  seriously lacking, as mentioned. Chiren's story of redemption definitely  got cut apart somewhere in editing. And why was Dr. Ido's assistant  even in this movie? She did literally nothing.

*Again, Alita was trying to discover herself and sought to do so through conflict and as a hunter-warrior. She wanted to help right wrongdoings and hold killers accountable. She is new to Iron City and has not been jaded or beaten down by that world, so she's a contrast to the rest of society.*

*As for Vector, Grewishka, and Zapan, I can see why they are still unclear as characters. Their roles in the movie are pretty close to the manga, and in the manga, the chaotic, violent nature of the Scrapyard is heavily emphasized. The Iron City in the movie was pretty sterilized and way less violent in comparison. In the manga, it's not confusing why Alita would be at odds with various psychotic serial killers and vicious hunter warriors, etc...because violence is very common, and in the manga, the Grewishka character (actually, it's a cyborg named Makaku in the manga), is in love with and obsessed with Alita, which is part of his motivation.* 

*He also hates the Scrapyard because he was injured and relegated to the underground while growing up. These things are hinted at in Grewishka's dialogue (he lived in the underground, he would make a necklace out of Alita, he wants to take off her head upon first meeting), but the manga had much more detail in setting up his role, so the character is much more significant.*

[https://battleangel.fandom.com/wiki/Makaku](https://battleangel.fandom.com/wiki/Makaku)

*Zapan is also a very significant character in the manga for multiple reasons, and his plotline is not done by the end of this movie.

elhz2ur,">It just creeped me out a bit how much so many grown men latched onto it

The source material is from the 90s. I was into Ghost in the Shell and stuff like this as a teen. I was 12 when the author started releasing this manga in 1990. I'm ""creepy"" for liking what I've enjoyed most of my life now? Do you apply this same standard for even older people who are into Marvel movies because they liked Marvel comics as a kid?

""Come to think of it it was creepy how she's a kid but then she grows boobs in the second half""

Ido attached her to a body previously intended for his teenage daughter. She was older than that. She also has a human brain. There is nothing unusual about a young woman wanting to look like a young woman or viewing herself as a young woman. That body can morph depending on who is attached; this comes up again later in the manga.

"" I think it's a movie that was intended for young girls...""

It wasn't, and the source material was even darker and far more graphic and gory (including omitted savagery of eating brains to satiate and endorphin addiction), not exactly the type of thing young girls gravitate towards.

""but as a person she is a total Mary Sue (a phrase I don't use very often).""

You shouldn't because you clearly don't understand the meaning of the term. Alita endured a horrific childhood and earned every bit of her combat skill through years of training. She is tough because what she went through made her tough. She is skilled in combat because she trained from early childhood under military commandos/  Künstlers fighting on the front lines of a massive war. She also makes huge mistakes, exhibits exploitable vulnerabilities such as being unable to protect people she cares about, and loses a major battle. Her skills were earned through training and tremendous suffering. None of this is consistent with the definition of a Mary Sue.",aoc6mr
ekq69h5,"> Come to think of it it was creepy how she's a kid but then she grows boobs in the second half 

She is not a kid, she was of adult age during the war. This got reflected by the body.

> okay sure she's a robot

She's not a robot (I'm getting tired of this actually).

> then why is she wearing clothes later

Because, like all people, she is a social creature and walking around without clothes is not socially acceptable?..

> It's very ""born sexy yesterday"", so that makes sense.

The movie subverts literally every facet of the trope, more so, this is *the main theme of the movie,* but yeah, okay, born sexy yesterday, of course.

You know, the only source of ""creepy vibes"" I see now is from you. Were you aroused by Alita in her ""doll"" body? You might need to get counselling on that.

Also I always love backwards thinking. Take a conclusion, and then find a reason that would fit it. Usually - in normal thinking process - observation precedes conclusion. In this case (and it's but one of a bunch) clearly conclusion is the primate and observation is but a tool of support for said primate.

I will ignore the Mary Sue and boring characters part (it is plain ridiculous for me personally, as well as extremely subjective by nature) and will add a small illustration of what I said in previous paragraph: motorball rules, while never stated in full, are quite clearly transmitted by visual means and reinforced by repetition; several teams or individual players race along the track while competing for control over a motorized ball (hence the name of the game); the team (or player) that manages to reach the finish and put the ball into a special socket wins.

Aside from the action, the strongest part of the movie was the father-daughter relationship of Ido and Alita.  Ido had tragically lost his daughter, and he saw Alita as his surrogate daughter.   The care and detail in designing the shell for his daughter that was used on Alita was evident.  I'm sorry you can't identify with a father's love for his daughter.  Maybe you should stick to Captain Marvel where Carol Danvers' memories of her father was a mean, cold bastard who yelled at her all the time.  

> creepy how she's a kid but then she grows boobs in the second half

Ido built the first body for his daughter who was much younger.  Alita is definitely older.  This was revealed in scenes where she's [fighting on the moon](https://preview.redd.it/0v1gutoovzn21.gif?width=1024&format=mp4&s=53cad400f2d7be4837df1e9dbd348645d7b0a1f2) and ascending the tube to Zalem with her military unit.  Stay off your phone and pay attention to the movie next time.  

> I think it's a movie that was intended for young girls

[Let Rosa Salazar explain it to you because you're obviously not going to let me ""mansplain"" it to you.](https://youtu.be/sw1Ayi8FUzQ?t=202)  In short, it's a universal story that everyone can identify with unlike the feminist movie, Captain Marvel.

> the fact that it's getting a cult following amongst anti-SJW men is not a good look.  It's very ""born sexy yesterday"", so that makes sense.

Wow, direct talking points by feminists. [How Alita: Battle Angel Found an Unlikely Fanbase in MRA Trolls](https://twitter.com/TheMarySue/status/1113622213607993345)  Ironically, it has been [feminists and SJWs who have been trolling and bashing the Alita movie.](https://fabiusmaximus.com/2019/03/07/review-battle-angel-alita/)  Now they want to claim only misogynist men like Alita and hate Brie ""Resting Bitch Face"" Larson.  LOL.  

> every other character is boring as hell, even Alita.

Wow, your heart is cold as an ice cube.  The best moments are just watching the myriad of emotions on Alita's face and sharing them with her.  For a cyborg, she truly is the most human person I have seen in movies in a long time.  

> People are saying the movie has heart but tbh I fail to see anything unique, other than the special effects.

I don't think that is enough to say that that is the intended audience, I don't think that was the intended audience and I don't think manga was intended for young girls either. Also, Alita is not a child, even in her first body she has breasts, the look is that of a teenager, she is played by an actress in her 30s and ultimately she is a 300 year old brain in a robotic body. There are some moments that are a bit creepy if you focus on them, but it's not something that gets in the way of enjoying the movie and considering the Japanese source material they fit right in. Alita is a Mary Sue, but that is kind of hard to avoid without diverging from the source material more than would be desirable, we all love he anyway and the character development makes up for it, I completely disagree with you when you say the characters are boring.

On one end of the spectrum you have the non-anime fans who will be confused by the way the story will be told. These people will say bad things about the movie because it's not westernized enough for them.

Then you have people like you. The fans of the manga, who will nitpick incessantly at literally every difference. As if the movie MUST be 100% true to the original manga.

You tend to do a lot of TELL in a comic and in a low-budget anime....

In a movie it gets to be egregious and I absolutely believe that both the script of the OVA and this latest adaptation are hot trash. That is despite me liking anything at all in either one of these adaptations.

And you may need to rewatch that OVA to appreciate just how much of it made this 2019 movie into what it is. The stuff that you feel is mischaracterized or lifted inappropriately into this new film are incredibly paper thin as far as their overall impact. They're aesthetic, if anything.

For the Rollerball, Yukito Kishiro (the author) openly said Motorball was inspired by it. Maybe you didn't know, but the original manga was published between 1990 and 1995, so Elysium would be the complete ripoff, here.

The evolution of Alita (Gally in the manga) is also more subtle and well-developed in the original material, which is cut in like 3-4 parts. Obviously, she discovers her fighting abilities but indeed, could seem bipolar in the film. The ""cute puppy"" thing disappears completely after the death of Yugo (she initially starts playing Motorball after that, to forget).

Perhaps should you try to read Gunnm, if you're into mangas. You'll see lots of similarities with the movie, but without the cheesy narrative shortcuts. It's also waaay darker, mature and brutal. I really liked the movie and what they did for a PG-13, but Gunnm the polished diamant here.",aoc6mr

The movie basically takes 3 volumes of the manga (~600 pages and roughly 3 different arcs), adds new story stuff from the earlier video adaptation, creates significantly more flashback story, and splices all that together so it's basically simultaneous. For example the Motorball stuff in the manga doesn't even start until months after a certain major character is killed. [Hugo](#spoiler)

It's genuinely impressive they got to fit as much of the manga story in a 2 hour film as they did, but I agree with you its pacing creates very little impact. 

That's actually *not* true with the manga, which feels more like a bunch of different, complete stories arranged in a linear fashion. You get a big, full story, with a very conclusive ending, then the manga will shift environments, characters, even genre for the next story. Three-act structure, then new three-act structure, and so on. Alita herself transforms radically as a character, taking on new bodies, careers, even personality.

FWIW I felt the film was okay. It has a lot of that James Cameron pandering, making things that should be more subtle really stupidly obvious, like turning realistic villains you can empathize with into near-cackling psychopaths or romanticizing and softening obsessive, dangerous love.

ei725m8,"The problem with your comment is that the love story is meant to be complete garbage. It's a Romeo + Juliet style cautionary tale warning against the pitfalls of being over-willing to give your heart to someone you don't really know yet. In the source material, Yugo (Hugo) is hardly even interested in her and is only obsessed with getting to Zolem. He does eventually get feelings for her but only after she basically forces hers on him and then coaxes him to admit he has feelings for her too (I think he denies it at first if I remember right), but he is still barely interested in her compared to going to Zolem. He's also a lot more of a dirtbag in the source material and steals cyborgs' spines, not their limbs, which is a vital organ that can't be replaced (their brain and spine are the only things that aren't replaceable apparently). The whole point of this love story is to show Alita's naivety and so that she learns about how dark this world is (and how bad someone can turn out to be that you haven't really gotten to know). The movie is actually a step up from the source material b/c it makes Hugo at least half-likeable/redeemable, shows more complexity to the character, but still keeps the plot thread that its due to Hugo's selfishness and Alita's naivety that he tragically dies and she loses her first love. Hugo is just as much of a dork/chump and immature in the source material, so the actor reproduced him fairly well.

TLDR: James Cameron barely changed the love story at all. It's faithful to the original. Your complaint is better directed at the original creator of the manga, and even then, it's missing the point. We aren't supposed to really buy their relationship, just Alita's development of feelings and attachments. Hugo is basically there to be fridged.

In the anime, he just says he was glad to have known her which was good enough.  He didn't have to say he loved her.  It's very odd that this was the one thing that Rodriguez changed.  Did he feel obligated to include a bonafide love story?  Did he feel it would make the end more intense?

Hugo, in general, was OK to me.  I didn't dislike this version of him, though I do feel they could have done a little more with his development.  Maybe they could have done a little more to further cement his relationship with Alita and show us how he came to the decision of quitting.  [As far as his reaction to his cyborg body... I chalked it up to just being life in Iron City.  Cyborgs are so commonplace, that when you become one, it's not jarring at all, it's just a ""well, this is my life now"" sort of reaction.

She's literally brain damaged, and reset to being a teenager.  

The romance was exactly what it was supposed to be, puppy love.

The dog dies to tell the audience that the villain is of no remorse.



> The main problem I felt was that it seems like they took a bunch of issues of the manga and try to go over each storyline, but compress it and rush through them in one movie. It’s a bit like how The Last Airbender tried to fit all of Season 1 of the TV show into the movie, and the story suffered greatly for it.

That's what was done.

Volumes 1 through 5 are a series of interconnected but independent stories;That cover Alita's daily life.

It isn't until Volume six that we get  the actual story, and even that is somewhat episodic focusing on Alita's experiences rather than the ""Quest"".
 
What was formed from the source material actually works; though not perfectly.

The manga is quite different:

> ! Desty Nova doesn't rule Salem, he is an exiled mad scientist, a bit like Ido (Chiren doesn't exist) ! <

> ! After the rollerball arc, she is recruited by Salem to be an antiterrorist agent, she eventually meet again with Nova who has some link with said terrorist. The head of the organization is his son who has a splitted personality, a good one and a bad one. ! <

> ! During this arc we learn that people from Zalem have a chip in place of their brain, by opposition of people from the city under who are mostly cybernetics except their brain. This cause chaos in Zalem. ! <

> ! Following this, she follow Nova, who profit from the chaos he caused by reveling the brain-chip thing to return to Zalem. He is followed by clone of her that were created as an anti- terrorist task force ! <

> ! On Zalem it is chaos and there is a war going on between the adults who have a brain-chip and the children who did not have it yet (it was given at 18 of ages ! <

> ! We eventually learn that there is a city in space that is kind of the other side of Zalem called Jeru (Jeru-Zalem), which is even more advanced ! <

> ! Gunnm finish about here, Alita get to Jeru where she fuse with the structure and become one with the city. This ending was rushed by the first manga publisher. Gunnm: Last Order take up a bit before she get up and goes an entirely different direction with a lot of backstory on the world and where we learn that Alita was in fact a terrorist who cause the destruction of the city and crashing of the human civilization in the first place. For some reason there are immortals vampires too. Most of Last Order is a big fight that introduce space politics and backstory to the world. This is also the first time that Mars is mentioned, by opposition to the movie where Mars is already known. ! <

> ! Then it continues to Gunnm: Mars Chronicles where we learn about the youth of Alita and that she was some form of cancer that took form and she always had a robotic body ! <

So that's mostly the story, one of my first remark regarding the movie is that it lack violence. The manga is a lot more violent but in a good way. It shows a bit more the roughness of the world and the impact.

I thought it was vastly better in Alita, RPO felt just like a lot of CG thrown in my face and I didn't care for any of it (I'll admit it was pretty though). I thought the action in the Mortorball sequence was much more focused and interesting, much more tension in the sequence overall.

>Bruishka (or Grewishka?) isnt a threat cause he keeps getting his ass handed to him every time and runs away like Team Rocket.

He's pretty threatening. I thought Jackie Earle Haley gave him an amazing presence. >!Oh and you know, he chops her to bits and was one second away to squish her to death before the help arrives, but yeah ""not threatening"". What did you want more? That he outright kills her and then the movie ends?!<

>There is not a single interesting visual gimmick or concept that felt fresh or new or really used the tech to create something even remotely breathtaking

Zapan looked amazing, I thought, seamless blend of his face to a cyborg body, clean job. And of course Alita. I thought the scenes in the beginning with her waking up and discovering her body, looking in the mirror etc. were just so pretty. I'm guessing Bill Pope (The Matrix) as a cinematographer had something to do with it. Plus just the amazing detail in her arms, they felt real rather than CG. I was also surprised how well her CG face could convey emotion. Most people felt no discomfort with the character being CG (even some people who didn't like the film) and I think that's a pretty good accomplishment. 

>I challenge any fan to show me a single frame that was beautifully presented and had the kind of visual splendour you expect from a movie that's so heavily promoting its visuals

Again the scene of her waking up in the beautifully illuminated room, it's not big fireworks but it worked for me. She really looked like a tangible character there rather than a CG object.

Also just the whole Motorball sequence was visually arresting to me. The sense scale was amazing in some moments. I like the part where she's pushed by one of the heavy cyborgs and then just swirls around out of control. I guess they were no were pretty colors (like a red flare or something), which is maybe why you didn't like that scene, but I really liked the cold steely feel of it. 

There's also a really beautiful time-lapse of Zalem near the end combined with Junkie XL score I thought was pretty beautiful. And just the sense of scale and detail in the cities in general were really impressive.

And that shot where Alita gets chopped to bits was just so well done too. You could hear a gasp in the theater where I attended.

I could go on but you get the idea.

With that said, I don't think it was a perfect movie, but I disagree COMPLETELY with your point that the visual spectacle was disappointing.

Seeing this seemingly fully grown being deal with the hardships of a world without justice, with emotions she barely understands is just beautiful. Shes practically a child in her mind, and still managed to use them to deal with death and love. You can see within the first 20 minutes of the movie, she literally had no concept of emotions she didnt even know what taste was, and still grew to love and make a family.

He also didn't have a dumb change of heart about his illegal activities. He had a way more established reason to want to go up to Zalem. Also no one had to frame him for a crime he didn't commit and it wasn't about Alita. Thanks to all of these elements, his desperate attempt to reach Zalem through the tube made much more sense.

If she wins and can’t climb up, just don’t let her (unless he really does want her to come back but again this feels sloppy rather than feels like a plan) This film definitely seems like it was written by or targeted at tweens and teens.

eghfv8z,"Mobile users, just to be safe:  SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE AND WHOLE SERIES.

&#x200B;

>!In my opinion, the movie has a concise plot structure with a flow of villains that makes sense for the time constraint of an adaptation, and although it makes concessions for various plot devices and ignores some off-screen lore, it alters the manga for the sake of the story, instead of having 20 different characters all acting with different motives, and people just-so-happening to show up at the right times, which happens in the manga.!<

>!For example,!<

* >!Alita just happens to save Ido when he runs into Makaku (replaced by the OVA fight);!<
* >!Ido just happens to survive a ton of blood loss, and Gon is able to rescue him (removed);!<
* >!Makaku just happens to find Kinuba and easily beat him (instead gives Vector more blame);!<
* >!Fang just happens to be able to save Kiyomi in the sewers (removed);!<
* >!Alita just happens to be able to attach Hugo’s head to her circulatory system (Chiren does it).!<

>!It also gets rid of a bunch of side characters, such as,!<

* >!Alita’s first bounty is replaced by Grewishka’s pawn Nyssiana;!<
* >!Kinuba being a motorball star instead of some other sport;!<
* >!Zapan wields the Damascus blade instead of some other side-character not in the arc;!<
* >!Grewishka defends Vector instead of a random bodyguard, Zariki.!<

>!It also removes some weird motivations, such as,!<

* >!Alita cuts off Zapan’s face instead of him ripping his own face off because he’s insane;!<
* >!Makaku killing just because he’s evil, replaced by him being a pawn of Vector/Nova.!<

>!Now there were some weak character motivations, such as why Ido has an about-face regarding Alita participating in motorball, why Chiren decides to help, and it removes Hugo’s backstory. However, by having a hierarchy of character conflicts, from Nova to Vector/Chiren, to Ido, to Hugo, to Alita, it creates a logical sequence of character arcs that drives the plot forward and makes the story tighter, in my opinion. If they maintained each individual character motivation (villains in particular), we’d have a very villain-of-the-week approach, and barring this, constructing the motivations of Nova, Vector, Chiren (and thus Ido), and Hugo together in a cascade effect gives us more room for Alita’s story. Because the story is an origins story about her, not the villains.!<

>!And yet they still managed to deliver Zapan and Hugo’s arcs pretty much intact. The villain that suffers the most, though, is Nova. I can imagine they made him the big bad because they wanted to tie him to Alita’s past, to make Alita’s past related to the current events. However, why he controls Vector and why Vector dies, I don’t know. I’m guessing they wanted to give Vector his just desserts, instead of having him live, never face any consequences in the movie, and people complaining that it’s more sequel bait.!<

>!I’m not really bothered by the other lore complaints you listed because none of those changes are seen on-screen:  the sky-cities aren’t shown, Ido’s marriage and child’s death isn’t shown, and Vector is seen dismantling Kinbua (which can be tied into how Jashugan is undefeated to preserve the status quo). I’m just glad that they had the plot point of sending body parts to Zalem at all. The movie could’ve easily just said he sold within the Scrapyard, but they chose to include one of his actual motivations. I talked about the Damascus blade earlier, and I think it’s a good concession to give it to Zapan, since he both uses a blade and Alita needs a blade, without having to actually get into the Motorball arc and it makes Zapan hate Alita even more.!<

>!Overall, I think they did a masterful job of tying up some of the manga’s loose ends while still presenting a story that makes sense while avoiding conveniences and unrelated characters. It removes some backstory, but adds in more action, cameos, and focuses more on Alita than the rest of the cast.!<",aoc6mr

She also practice in her room. So she wasn't starting from 0 at the beginning of the movie. You have to consider all the training she did before and what happened to her during the war period.

He was just a local crime boss who wanted powers.  He made it pretty clear when he told Hugo that they could live like kings in the city below, but they would be at the bottom of the food chain in the city above.


> Why the hell did she have a change of her heart with helping Alita rescue Hugo when the whole she was obsessed with getting back to Zalem even if it meant killing her? 

Because she has just overheard Vector casually mentioned that (in reference to Hugo's ambition) no one from the slums below would ever go to Zalem in one piece.  That was when she realized Vector had been deceiving her and making false promises.  I thought that scene was very clear because the camera zoomed into Chiren's facial reaction as Vector unwittingly remarked that no one from the city below would go to Zalem in one piece.  When I saw Chiren's facial reaction to that careless comment of Vector, I knew she would betray him.

What happened in the manga was really similar to what happened here- a job with his (unnamed) friends went bad when Zapan showed up- but in the original, Hugo wasn't planning to back out- I think they just added that to make him seem more redeemable. 

>Chiren to Vector: ""I'm suddenly back in touch with my more human side, I'm out, and how could you continue to do this you monster

For what it's worth, I'm pretty sure her initial reason for deciding to betray him was the realization the Vector was laughing about dangling the same ""get to Zalem"" lure in front of other people too. With that dream dead, she lost anything she could use to tell herself ""the ends justify the means.""

I suspect she would have stuck with Vector if she hadn't realized the promise of getting to Zalem (intact) was a lie.",aoc6mr

Hugo, who is an independent scrapper who sets his own schedule, waits until juuust before his girlfriend's motorball debut to seek out his friends in order to quit? Since when do you have to formally quit your illegal body-jacking gang of friends? And wouldn't he need to quit to Vector, the guy who actually gives them orders and pays them? And why did that need to happen before his girlfriend's motorball match? And why did he feel compelled to do it literally as they were body-jacking someone? I could go on.

I know why that happened structurally, they needed to ennoble Hugo to justify the relationship with Alita, and they ran out of time before they had to have Zapan kill him, but it just did not hang together at all.

Stuff like that is why they really needed to scale back the story. Way too much lore for a first movie, especially one clearly intended to have a sequel.",aoc6mr
egnjn86,"I don't understand the criticism of it being muddled or messy. Or maybe it's because the manga chapters that are relevant were fresh in my mind that might have helped.

I think they did an excellent job of bringing the different plot threads together. Weaving them together so that they make more cohesive sense. It's a much more tighter story than the source. For example, the motorball arc comes in way later, but they introduce it early to be weaved into the Hugo arc (motivation for Hugo to set up Alita during her try outs).

If you feel it better sense to break it up into separate episodes then if course it would because that's how the source material worked. The different arcs very loosely transition to the other.

As for wanting a hard R, again the source material is shockingly gory and violent when I first read it, but of course I should have expected that from 80s to early 90s Japanese cyberpunk (see Akira).

Yes they did, because that's how the manga did it.



The heart matters because it's a part of Alita, the sport matters because it's a part of the setting's culture and it's the first bit of pop culture that Alita sees.


[The blades were closing around Alita as she jump towards Grewishka,  and she was sliced to bits](#spoiler)



[So that we the audience get's to see the pit crews, Vector and Chiren.](#spoiler)


[It was more dramatic for us the audience for Hugo to talk to his friends mid job, and in the act is how they were caught in the manga.](#spoiler)


[Not jumping over the ring was a flaw.](#spoiler)


[Hugo's new body wasn't all that sturdy to begin with, and that's how he died in the manga. ](#spoiler)

There were no pacing issues technically, there was a deliberate but imprudent choice to try and retain some of the feel of the adapted parts of the manga which were nigh episodic in nature.


The character's have motives.


The people lack the means of rebellion, at least in the city.

It's just ""his"" chill spot - he was showing off his favorite spot and talking it up. Even as he claimed ""best view in the city,"" there were clearly larger buildings with 'better' views visible all around him. In the manga, I think he liked to go hangout in an old windmill on the edge of town, or something like that.

>why the fuck was that love story nesessary, making them friends would have been something refreshing. also why would you kill hugo then save him only to let that bitch ass die again, but oh wait he probably will be alive in the next movie only to be novas leverage against alita, and die again

Nah, he's dead for good. In the manga, his death is what pushed Alita to run away from home and join the motor ball circuit (to forget her life before). 

In the movie, his death is what's pushing Alita to dive into the motorball circuit (for a chance to get to Zalem and kick Nova's ass). Without that, I don't think she'd have that much reason to care about getting to Zalem in particular.

>why the fuck does no one have planes, why the fuck does no one bother to repair the one they have lying around ?

In the manga, creating a flying-anything is punishable by death. Hugo's brother tried to get his family to Zalem by building a hot air balloon, but his wife got cold feet and reported him to The Factory- leading to him being killed in front of Hugo, which in turn led to Hugo becoming obsessed with attaining his brother's dream of a better life in Zalem.

>also what the fuck is motor ball kind of a sport, there are soo many gladiator style variations and they happen to choose the one that makes no sense, why is there there a ball involved ? this seems so overthought

It's 90s cool - which is around the time the manga came out. I didn't care for the motorball scenes in the manga that much, but I liked 'em in the movie.

Really if you want to have a greater appreciation for the movie and understand some of the scenes a bit more the manga is an excellent read although the later parts of it start to delve into Matrix territory of nonsensical...but the good kind of nonsensical.

The way they arranged it, they could make a second film and finish the whole story. I think it worked really well.

For ex: >!Ido and chiren could have gone to iron city specifically to have her traditionally.
The Martian conflicts do exist in the books and to tie them in to the fall of zalem actually allows to introduce the tube blades in a nice planting payoff way.

I'm 90% sure he never killed anyone in the manga- he pulled spines, but that just meant people couldn't control their robot bodies until they found a replacement. A dude who had his spine stolen in the manga was explaining it on Ido's table, I think.

The romance in the movie is more generic teen romance, and less one-sided than it was in the manga. The movie doesn't include Hugo's backstory (I've heard there's a prequel book that covers it maybe), and while he's definitely focused on Zalem, he's not as totally obsessed with it as he was in the original. They did change up the scene where Alita finds out about him to make him come off as a little more redeemable, but it's not a huge deal, and it happened more-or-less like it did in the manga.

I've been reading the manga since Jr. High, and keep up with the latest series to this day. Even with the changes, I still saw the movie twice, and I'm legit considering checking it out again.

IMO, Hugo was fine, just minus his back story. In the original, Hugo was a character who hit me *hard* - but I feel like I can see why they made the handful of changes they did for the sake of the rest of the movie, and it didn't bother me much personally.",aoc6mr

Also, do you see this standard applied to the recent >20 braindead Marvel movies? Alita is actually following the manga fairly closely rather than rewriting the entire theme into some Hollywoodized garbage like the live action Ghost in the Shell. Some things are shifted around or consolidated or altered in a way that works better for the time-limited format of a live action movie, but similar to the Lord of the Rings adaptation, it's very clear the writers deeply understood and greatly respected the source materials. The spirit of the source materials (both manga and OVA) is always respected. For example, the ""I'd give you my heart!"" line is from in the context of a challenge/ wager to a very formidable opponent rather than in a romantic declaration to Hugo, but the purpose in both cases is to show Alita is all-or-nothing 100% intense and committed.

Hugo's feelings toward Alita are even easier to explain as her character is extremely unique. Their relationship also grows throughout the film - at first Hugo is fine to leave her at the stadium to pursue his life of crime. His feelings change as he gets to know her more.

I have no idea but I wouldn't be surprised if He tossed Alita's core and brain down with the trash to see what kind of impact she would have, would she be a challenge?  Would he be entertained? Think from the perspective of an immortal you're bored with the same old shit, you want to feel alive again, you want to live on the edge, so you create your own crisis to see how it all unfolds.  Maybe it's just all the vampire i've played but I've had my old bored vampires move pawns in a way to set up an archnemesis just so they could maybe get one little beat from their cold dead hearts.

Hugo exists as a plot device not necessarily to be a genuine love interest, but rather as a focus of Alita/Gally's infatuation, as she comes to grip with herself. It's also part of her character to be stupidly earnest and intense, which makes for awkward dialogue, but deliberately, I think? 

I felt like they played it pretty well actually. The surrounding dialogue in the actual film gives enough context that you are supposed to understand that their interactions are deliberately awkward and floundering. Challenge is that if you slice away the context, for a trailer, the corn factor is pretty high.",aoc6mr
egtr5ag,"But his history of basically only living day to day to get up to the city above, was more of a focus.

Even Hugo's brother, who had the same goals, met a similar fate because of forgoing his wife to chase his dream. His brother meets his demise after his own wife sells him out to the Hunter Warriors, so in the end, both brothers lose their lives to chasing dreams.

So, to me, this makes the end of Hugo slightly less corny as it was in the movie, and you actually kind of cheer for him when he gives up to agree to go back with Alita... only to get buzzsawed to death ",aoc6mr
egsj2v1,I gotta disagree. In the manga he had a tragic backstory which fueled his selfish actions. In the movie we dont see any of that and the fact that in the movie he goes out to tell his friends to stop when there was no reason to and inadvertently gets them all killed was the dumbest scene in the movie. And then Alita who had super killer instincts let Zapan pick up the knife and stab Hugo from behind her. They could have rewrote that scene much better.

CM is a slog with an empty vessel of a character as well as subpar effects with flat, visually inert action. 

Alita is a FAR more investing film on an emotional level and a technical level. It has some goofy dialogue and the usual blatant exposition in films like this, too. But at least it mostly served the plot and characters in an organic way. Captain Marvel felt like a wiki page at times.

Well, the problem I have with that is that by leaving so many story threads dangling at the first movie in order to save things for future installments, it makes this first movie feel really incomplete and not able to stand up on its own. Like, it’s different from just having mysteries to be answered in later movies; it’s more like things feel like they were deliberately taken out of this movie so that they can be put into sequels.

The other concern is that the first movie is not guaranteed to kickstart a movie franchise. It’s just as likely that this movie does so poorly that the studio cans any possibility for sequels. So this might just be a prologue, but it kinda does need to have a complete story in it on its own. I don’t feel like what we got really works on that front.",aoc6mr

I could be totally wrong here too but during her time in the Kansas bar she seemed at least to me to shift from casual/more naive talk to as if her unconscious warrior spirit was talking.  She'd give some witty comeback then speak more formally and with different tone.  For eg.  ""you do not deserve such a weapon.""

I may have been reading more into it than what it was but it was as if even she was not entirely conscious of the changes in cadence/tone/rhythm/grammar/choice of words etc as her ""new"" mind and ""old"" mind were coordinating/integrating.

I think the pedo vibe came way more from the camera shots and the way Hugo and the bad guys interact with her. Maybe it's because I'm female, maybe it's because I'm a mom of two, but there were scenes that I found unsettling, scenes where her body was treated more as something to oogle than something that was a part of her person... with long camera pans along her chest, flanks, et al. Perhaps that's something worth exploring further... what happens to body identity and the sense of privacy when you are no longer flesh and blood? 

Personally, I just found it uncomfortable that she went from clothed, to eventually sitting ""naked"" on the table next to her father figure, to yoga moves ""naked"" and then while being upgraded, comments about her body looking more mature. That was just .. weird to me, and unsettling. If your body is all about the machines and upgrades, why does it need to look human at all anyways? Why does it need to look like an idealized, sexual, female body, especially? When is there ever a reason to wear clothes if you don't even have flesh? The whole thing reminded me of the reason comics had/have skintight hero costumes- it's basically ""painted on"" - because it puts anatomy on full display.

I am a bit offended that you think the points raised are pandering to some paranoia or agenda. Claiming that it is, is just shutting down the conversation instead of exploring the arguments more deeply. :/

ehnsu1r,"You are not the first to agree with me, either.

Interestingly, I'm familiar with the manga casually, but  have never read it, so I had guessed a lot of the source material probably had some of the same criticism. Certainly, some fans have defended the movie on this basis alone, but I have my own problem with that, which is another discussion for another day.

I would also say it's well enough known that a lot of Japanese manga and anime carry some of these common tropes in general, especially around women and girls, as well as culturally in greater Japan. There's a reason many women there emulate the childlike voice and mannerisms (think ""kawaii"" and  ""burikko"" ). Even Japanese porn often caters in this area (cue classic videos of schoolgirls in too short skirts getting surreptitiously fondled on a subway). 

The fact that all of this can be seen and its causes studied through the lens of Japanese culture doesn't excuse it, though. With enough US figures and studios pumping time, talent, and money into this movie marketed to a US consumer, what was the excuse not to do better? Then again, these people aren't motivated enough to make this movie, let alone media in general, important or impressionable enough to bring change, but rather to maximize the dollar bills in their pockets. 😞

ego4rzb,"True, Alita says pretty straightforwardly what she likes and wants - mainly to fight, to find out who she is, and to be with Hugo. Perhaps my actual complaint is that her motivations are just weak, and she doesn't actively pursue them - key word being actively. See, I would disagree that her motivations are the catalyst for the events of the film. Things occur that further her personal goals, but Alita is almost never making them happen. She finds herself in fights that she apparently kind of enjoys, but only because the villains are setting up situations where she is forced to fight. And she slowly learns more about who she is, but only because she lucks into finding the URM spaceship and regularly has revealing flashbacks. And she wants to be with Hugo, and fortunately he likes her too and things are good with them until the end of the movie.

I think that is my problem with Alita's character - she is never meaningfully obstructed from getting what she wants, so there is no narrative tension. The one exception, maybe, is >!of course when Hugo dies (twice)!< but even in that case she just got unlucky. Like, she didn't do anything wrong here that caused her goal to be lost, just as she didn't do anything particularly right in other situations to get what she wanted.

I keep coming back to her big motorball sequence. Sure, you can explain why she is doing it - Hugo told her to do it, she likes fighting, and fighting can awaken memories in her - but there is no tension. I do not know what it means for her if she wins or loses. She has been steadily getting everything she wants up until this point, and there is nothing at stake in the outcome of this game/fight.

(And it doesn't help that Alita's base power level is so high. By the time she gets her new body, she is basically unstoppable, further mitigating any possible tension.)",aoc6mr

You are contradicting yourself, though:

> James Cameron barely changed the love story at all.

He changed the story a lot based on what you said! If Hugo was meant to be malicious and hard-to-get, then we got the exact opposite character in the movie.
Remember when the doctor said he's no good? It didn't make much sense if he just stole replaceable parts because of his dream of getting to Zolem. It's like stealing a car from a wealthy man: sure, it's not a good thing to do, but also not that bad considering you are desperate.
Stealing vital organs and effectively killing the victim? Now that is something to be frowned upon.

I think the movie would benefit if his character was more grim and focused only on his goals. Instead, we got a typical teenager dipshit with zero depth.

> That does kind of suck most of the time, but since it's such a short arc compared to the rest of the series, it works.

Yep, that's what I figured. 

>The character progression was fine, just not what most people are used.

That's what I said clunky instead of bad. It was okay but at times incredulous and nonsensical. Her motivation to take down Nova, say, as informed by Hugo's death, is a weak motivator given her very superficial feelings toward a boy she only thinks she loves. I'd much rather it be a character flaw that she later recognizes - her naivete. 

>Alita know literally nothing, information has to be fed to her.  
>  
>Japanese fiction seems to tell more than western and that aspect was retained.

I don't have an issue with her being fed information. My problem is the method. The beginning of the movie is literally, ""Let me tell you of our world, oh child."" Instead of bestowing her the knowledge as part of her exploration of this world. Alita's small confrontation with a centurion, for example, was a good segue to explain the tyrannical government. Another awful example is when the doc's ex wife literally said to the audience: ""I was a bit surprised to find her in the body of our daughter."" Like... thanks for telling us this very unnaturally phrased sentenced, given the context. Why not use her name? Why not use a pronoun that only she and him would intuit as referring to their daughter? Etc... etc... 

>Alita surviving three hundred years in the trash and finding the Berserker body near by are the only things that I'd call contrived. 

The entire sequence of Zapan framing Hugo with murder is not explained. Like... oh, you can just kill someone and blame it on some guy? Let's ignore the fact that Hugo's dead friend is lying there SLICED IN HALF by a sword that kinda looks like Zapan's but oh well. Only Hugo did the murdering here. That and Hugo later telling Alita: ""It's not what it seems like... I can explain..."" instead of shouting ""Whoa whoa listen!

We still know next to nothing about who Alita was pre-amnesia. Simply that she was a highly trained child soldier. It seemed like she was still capable of emotions and feelings, so it seems like URM wasn't making Congo children type killing machines, but we really don't know anything for sure.

Alita doesn't need to remember anything about her past for my plot to work. She is simply shown this new world, and through the eyes of innocence/not being jaded over her entire life, she does things that are right. Things other citizens have known need to change, but through apathy or indoctrination have accepted as the way things are. As she rallies the people to a positive change in lifestyle she can start remembering things about her past. This makes her question who/what she is. Is she the person she has made herself to be since being awoken, or is she the person created to destroy Nova? It is an actual inner struggle of self to figure out one's identity.

I think this movie is actually an example of something sticking too close to the source material. Motorball is just stupidly ridiculous. Just make it a gladiator arena. There is no need for the bells and whistles of putting it on a track. Another thing, Waltz looked ridiculous with that rocket hammer. If an actor can't use the prop just change it. Better than him awkwardly carrying around a clearly plastic prop the entire time. And again, there is this really interesting world to delve into and learn more about.

He would probably ask ""we're can i buy your parts so i can build one of you myself? They look cool."" - or he would probably kill her to get the body for sale. 

Point is: In this universe can't be any love between humans and machines. It's just stupid. 

Let me explain what i meant in regards to the ending: 

She became the most powerful weapon system in that world. She is unstoppable by everything and just learned that Nova betrayed everyone and anyone, even his loyal muppets who represent him down there (getting killed and not send up). It was very clear that nobody will every make it up alive because Nova much prefers ""human organs"" above anything. Alita knowing even more about his evil ways from hundred years ago and has programmed this mission into her core to defeat him.

Seeing all of this in front of her, and her buddy dying, she then makes a 90° turn by trying to earn an ""elevator ticket"" by participating in an orchastrated sports event, lead by the evil man himself?

How on earth would Alita actually belive that this will work. That ticket will be worthless. No way Nova will just invite her up to allow her to kill him, right? Will never happen. Nova controls everything and everyone. She has to use her power and enter by force. 

But then to leave to play Motorball is just living within Novas world and completely going against everything that has made her who she is.

The problem is that she lacks any clear motivation and constantly bounces between this thematically meaningless side goals of motorball and being a hunter-warrior.  This is the the major problem with the movie. It bounces around going nowhere and has no thematic core to keep it focused.

If you were going to rewrite this movie you'd ditch everything and just focus on her amnesia and desire to go to Zalem. You don't have a giant flying city that is constantly there and then never actually go to it because there is a crappy sport called Motorball. It's entirely the wrong way round. Motorball should be the B plot and Zalem is the A plot because the big evil guy is in Zalem and her history revolves around Zalem.

All the good characters revolve around Zalem. The doctors wife wants to go back to Zalem. The doctor knows he can't go back to Zalem and that Alita will be killed going there.

But in Alita it was bam-bam-bam ""that can't be good"" then cut to the next scene.

egq2tw3,"I have nothing against naivety in romances, but the heart scene was really too much for me. Alita basically offers to mutilate herself for him, and she didn't even have to because Hugo had collected almost all the money he needed - OK it was quite a hefty sum to begin with, but at that stage it was probably just a matter of weeks or months, and given how young he is he still had plenty of time anyway. 

Of course, Hugo's job is dangerous, but Alita doesn't know it - as far as she knows he earned that money by repairing stuff and doing deliveries. There's also the fact that Alita could just hunt bounties and give him the money, which is completely within her reach and doesn't involve selling her own organs. 

The heart scene is just there to foreshadow the twist with Alita keeping Hugo's head alive with it, but it doesn't make scene within its context. It's absolutely hardcore for no reason, and I found it hilarious how Hugo is completely terrified by it (""uhh wtf girl""), and Alita herself brings attention to how hardcore it was afterwards.

TBH I would be ok with that scene if Alita and Hugo were *really* coded as 15-years-olds, but I'm under the impression that it's not really the case. I guess that's why I had problems with the romance thread - Alita kinda works as an enthousiastic, naive, happy-go-lucky teen who's enamoured with the independant dude who showed her the town, but given how mature and cool-headed he is compared to her, Hugo's own attraction for Alita felt a bit gross. It's like a 25-years-old dude dating a 15-years-old girl. It's weird.

Well, bigger than when she started. Having any boobs at all makes absolutely no sense for a war machine, so the only viable explanation is that this is fanservice. Which, again, I wouldn't object to, if it wasn't for the anime eyes and just how youngish she still acts. In combination, it's yuckie.

It’s almost kind of comical when  she’s trying to give Hugo her antimatter heart, or when she’s shouting at him about him having a bounty on his head. It doesn’t come off that she’s brain damaged, it comes off that the scene and dialogue were cringe-inducing and cliche. What I’m trying to get at is, the movie didn’t feel like it was actually written to that level of subtlety. Maybe it was like that in the original manga, but here it just didn’t work for me.

Did they really need to have that character kill the dog to know he’s remorseless? It’s the third introduction of that character to us when we see him kill the dog, and it’s the second time that Alita meets him. We already met the dude from when he was working with those serial killer cyborgs in the beginning and talking about wanting to kill Alita, and again when he limped his way back to the Factory and was screaming bloody murder to Cherin and Vector about wanting to kill Ido and Alita. At the point of the bar scene, I already kinda figured he was pretty much an evil, violent asshole.

It’s totally doable to have the Kick The Dog moment and not actually kick the dog, and even get some storytelling bonuses like showing Alita stopping the guy from killing the dog and launching straight into the fight. Actually killing the dog feels gratuitous and unnecessary, especially since Alita kinda just stands there waiting for him to do it while he’s aiming his knife chain hands at the thing? That part felt especially awkward to me. Maybe this gets pulled off better in the manga.

Re: adapting of a serial, episodic story to a single movie or even trilogy of movies, I think that can run really poorly in a lot of cases. There’s a lot of pressure from the studios to set up sequels using the source material’s expansive story and world, but can end up just making the first movie a bloated mess if it tries to stick too faithfully to the original story plotting. See the aforementioned example of ATLA movie, or more recently I’ve heard Mortal Engines fell into similar problems.

Like I mentioned, I think it’s likely just adaptations issues here and I would probably like the original manga.

Re: Nova, it’s not so much we need the big bad to die in the first movie, it’s more that during the second half of the movie I realized that they were trying to turn this into a series of movies and they weren’t going to finish any of the story threads I was actually interested in during this movie, like why URM was fighting Zalem 300 years ago, who Nova is and how he got into power, etc. It’s why I’m probably going to go read the original manga, since I’m really intrigued by those things and want to see how it turns out, and I get the feeling the movie probably won’t get the sequels it needs to tell the rest of the story.

egdcfac,"Bruishka dismembering didn't have any impact cause

a)the movie already established that losing your limbs is mostly an inconvenience than a real threat. It's on the level of getting carjacked as opposed to say, Luke, losing his hand in TESB. When someone dies in the Matrix its permadeath and scary When someone loses their limbs in Alita its ""oh no guess they have to go to the doctor to get a bandaid'.Plus she was already taking down a gang of killers so taking down one more didn't have an I.psct.

b)She had already kicked his ass and did it thrice. At no point did it feel like he had the upper hand cause she can beat with just one arm.

c)The movie has already established the URM suit so you know that a dismembering is gonna happen soon. The 2nd Bruishka fight loses all tension as to how it will resolve itself.A good comparison would be Agent Smith from Mayrix - he's always equal or better than Neo and a real life ending threat.So when Nro kills him so easily at the end it really feels like a huge levelling up by Neo.When Alita slices Bruishka, Im not impressed cause she had already beaten him twice in a row and once with one arm.

>She really looked like a tangible character there rather than a CG object.

As I said, it's just a showcase for photoreal tech than anything else. The scene itself isn't all that visually interesting. I'm not saying that the FX are bad, they are amazing but not used to display anything truly spectacular.

As for the colour palette, that's subjective but I felt like the movie was monotonous in its use of dimly lit and featureless alleys and holes for fights. Huge lack of variety in settings overall. Which is a shame cause anime, in general, tends to have wilder, looser and random uses of colour and visuals generally and I thought the movie wasn't able to tap into that aspect of manga/anime.

It's like saying that females who go for bad boys who abuse them do so just because, without identifying the common patterns among said females.

&#x200B;

Not sure if you're familiar with Berserk, but the manga's romance is logically built on common grounds shared between both sides of the relationship. There is a reason why Guts and Casca find themselves in one another. There is a reason why Farnese and Serpico, though leading an abusive relationship, stick together. It's not just nonsense.

Had Alita realized it we'd call it a character flaw, but in the movie it   is played as something good. It's good she's naive. It's good she still wanted to be with Hugo after his recovery. It's good that she's all-or-nothing. What should be a character flaw is played as a forte, and that doesn't do it for me. 

Too many people, in my douche opinion, think with their emotions and not with their critical faculties and that's why this kind of character development earns a pass. Our standards are too low.

There was no main driving force story for Alita. We never saw the city, didn't really see Nova. We didn't know Nova's motivations nor what his reasons for doing things.

Alita's main drive was the love story for Hugo, and I found that dialogue cheese and poorly acted. This meant I didn't give a shit about their screen time.

So I didn't care about the protagonist's story and hated the acting of the supporting role.

To me it lacked a decent plot or a fulfilling ending. I found the murder ball scenes (especially the training) very cheesy, reminding me of Police Academy.

I honestly left the cinema completely disappointed and it surprises me so many are enjoying it. I'm not hating people for that -- hey more power to you!! -- I'm just shocked is all. 

I wanted I guess something like, I dunno, Hunger Games or Elysium or Maze Runner or whatever.

Hero protagonist brings down powerful controlling empire.

“ In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept of the uncanny valley suggests humanoid objects which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit uncanny, or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers.[2] Valley denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.[3]”

I haven't read the Manga, but the way you're describing it makes it seem like the Manga improves on a lot of the story elements that were weak in the movie. 

The protagonists' personalities weren't very interesting in the movie. Hugo had an undying devotion to Alita almost from the beginning. Alita (as you said) was too righteous, and I wish there were more weird scenes like the ""I'd give you my heart"" moment which illustrate how she's not only physically different, but also emotionally different from everyone else as well. 

Also, was Ido more interesting in the Manga? In movie he was little more than the ""kind father whose only flaw that he's overprotective and cares too much"" trope.

I don't think Nova 'wants' Chiren back. Although Chiren and Ido were both very talented cyber-surgeons, I didn't notice any suggestion that Nova wanted them to come back.

Why did the sword cut through the sword then stop? Well it's very thick metal, required a lot of force from Alita to stab into it initially and the friction just made it stop eventually?

Yet even this extremely safe strategy has its limits. The post-Marvel Endgame landscape will be very interesting to see. I'm sceptical that Disney can maintain the momentum and audiences will just treat Endgame as a jumping off point.

If it is, what keeps people from living in communities outside of Iron City so they can avoid getting ganked by serial killer cyborgs harvesting body parts for the bad guy? What’s Zalem like, is it really the paradise everyone in Iron City thinks it is or is it far more sinister up there than down there?

It was a crazy gamble I'll agree.

But the nature of the source material, what James personally liked, and how they chose to adapt, directed them onto this path.

* It may well have been mistake.

They formed one plot from many smaller plots, chose not follow the Small Town Hero Story that this part of the manga was to make a Hollywood epic, and pulled Nova forward to create a big bad giving Alita a greater scope villain and hint towards the reason for the war.

I heard that it was ""non-stop"" violence against *cyborgs* (that had blue blood), but I wasn't expecting the human deaths. 

In something like *Alien vs. Predator*, if you saw an injury or death, there was no blood. If you saw blood, it was a small amount, and not in the same frame as the death. Stick to that formula, and *bam*, PG-13. Lots of horror movies are also PG-13, as deaths are bloodless or off-screen.

But in Alita? That one dude straight up stuck his fingers through Hugo's shoulder, causing visible blood flow, then cut his friend completely in half, leaving the severed torso and legs in a pile of blood.

It's like we're going back to 1970s/80s level PG! (melting faces in Raiders, severed arm in Star Wars, etc)

And that is perfectly fine. Not every single person in a movie needs to have some important meaning.

Yet she did have some meaning afterall. She went from hating Alita because Alita appeared to 'take over' the role of her daughter, to accepting her as her daughter (her ""as a mother"" line), as Ido had already done. There is a mini-arc to the story all within just a single character (Chiren).

>This is also true of Nova. Since this is a standalone film, with no other context, Desty Nova does not need to exist.

This is part of the westernization of the film. It's not that it doesn't make sense to introduce him. It's that western culture likes to know who the bad guy is right away. Many Americans would become disinterested and lose interest if the whole movie goes by and they still don't know who the villain is supposed to be.

Sure they could have avoided talking about Nova, and just make Vector the prime villain, but then the movie would have a weak villain, and that would be heavily criticized. If doing a trilogy movie, there is no way they can fit the entire story anyway. Introducing characters early, and mixing multiple scenes into one (like how motorball and Yugo are out of order) becomes necessary. Even LotR had to do this.

Yugo, I am not sure what they were trying to do with him. He's the only character in the movie that I thought was out of place. They turned him into more of a love interest and he somehow became the main motivational factor for Alita. But I still think the movie kept true to how his story ended, despite changing some of his interactions with Alita to make it more Americanized.

I don't judge the movie based on how I would have done it myself. Because if I did the movie to my own liking, it would bomb completely.

In the movie the body part stealing didn't seem as dark -- actually the whole city/setting didn't seem as dark -- which takes away from his burning desire to leave. He's a nicer character in the movie, and they miss why he'd push himself to go up those long tubes himself.

They could have changed the story a bit and made her trauma something else, but as a big fan of the original story I appreciate how faithful it was. 

I think they should have changed the characterization of Hugo, though (and the actor too- he was miscast IMO) he’s a lot more obsessive with getting to Zalem and emotionally unstable. They downplayed his obsession with Zalem and wrote out his backstory as to why he wanted to go so badly in the first place (his brother wanted to go but was murdered before he could, so he wanted to honor him) It doesn’t help the actor was so wooden.

> I don't have an issue with her being fed information. My problem is the method. The beginning of the movie is literally, ""Let me tell you of our world, oh child."" Instead of bestowing her the knowledge as part of her exploration of this world. Alita's small confrontation with a centurion, for example, was a good segue to explain the tyrannical government. Another awful example is when the doc's ex wife literally said to the audience: ""I was a bit surprised to find her in the body of our daughter."" Like... thanks for telling us this very unnaturally phrased sentenced, given the context. Why not use her name? Why not use a pronoun that only she and him would intuit as referring to their daughter? Etc... etc...

Alita was being treated like a literal child and she was being informed as things became relevant.

Chiren came across as cold for much of the film so I just went with it.



> That's what I said clunky instead of bad. It was okay but at times incredulous and nonsensical. Her motivation to take down Nova, say, as informed by Hugo's death, is a weak motivator given her very superficial feelings toward a boy she only thinks she loves. I'd much rather it be a character flaw that she later recognizes - her naivete.

Alita is running on her last orders

* The last flash back is [Yoko](#spoiler) being told  that Nova is the Dragon that she must slay.

Combined with the fact Nova is now messing with her current life.

It's also in character Alita did tell Hugo that she's all or nothing, and in her past life accepted a literal scorched earth mission for the sake of killing one man.


> The entire sequence of Zapan framing Hugo with murder is not explained. Like... oh, you can just kill someone and blame it on some guy? Let's ignore the fact that Hugo's dead friend is lying there SLICED IN HALF by a sword that kinda looks like Zapan's but oh well. Only Hugo did the murdering here. That and Hugo later telling Alita: ""It's not what it seems like... I can explain..."" instead of shouting ""Whoa whoa listen! HE killed that guy and framed me!"" is reminiscent of Batman V Superman's infamous reason for battle. Clark should've just went in there and explain to Bruce that his mother is being kidnapped and he's forced to kill him otherwise she'd die.

> Alita doesn't need to remember anything about her past for my plot to work. She is simply shown this new world, and through the eyes of innocence/not being jaded over her entire life, she does things that are right. Things other citizens have known need to change, but through apathy or indoctrination have accepted as the way things are. As she rallies the people to a positive change in lifestyle she can start remembering things about her past. This makes her question who/what she is. Is she the person she has made herself to be since being awoken, or is she the person created to destroy Nova? It is an actual inner struggle of self to figure out one's identity.

Like I said or sweat up into a local rebellion. 

However that's not the plot...yet.

The first part of the story volumes 1 through 5, were very much a small town hero story.

What you propose i something closer to Star Wars or the Hunger Games.


It wouldn't have been an adaptation, more like derivation and it would have resulting in a lot of story being dropped...and any possible sequel  would have led directly into Last Order the second manga series.

Which would have required a lot of exposition or writing an almost entirely new story path.    




>  think this movie is actually an example of something sticking too close to the source material. Motorball is just stupidly ridiculous. Just make it a gladiator arena. There is no need for the bells and whistles of putting it on a track. Another thing, Waltz looked ridiculous with that rocket hammer. If an actor can't use the prop just change it. Better than him awkwardly carrying around a clearly plastic prop the entire time. And again, there is this really interesting world to delve into and learn more about. 

There is nothing wrong with a lethally dangerous form of roller derby.

I think resurrecting Hugo is the problem. The climax should be learning about betrayal after finding out what Hugo does to cyborgs. She should catch him in the act instead of some rando framing Hugo.

I misused the word ""few"". i meant there could have been more background details instead of that teenage-love plot that was completely uninteresting given the dimension of the universe they were trying to introduce.


The be a teenager plot gave us some fun and a bit of world building, and it gave Alita something that she'd missed out on...being a teenager.


> Later it was shown that alita was also way older than the professor imagined and i'd think she is past the teenage crush phase - she is a warrior.

If Alita's brain damage had been less severe and more of her original personality had remained then you'd be right and this would be a very,very,different story. 

> Hugo on the other hand is a scavenger by trade and earns money by ripping cyborgs apart at night, because well, who cares - they can just get new parts tommorow, no harm, right? - With that kinda mentalilty i found it very confusing that a guy like him could fall for a 90% cyborg, no matter how cute it is. In reality humans would approach cyborgs as an illusion, a thing, something you can build, replicate or take apart. A scanvanger would never ask ""yet another cyborg"" to go on a date.. He would probably ask ""we're can i buy your parts so i can build one of you myself? They look cool."" - or he would probably kill her to get the body for sale.

Cyborgs are still human, Alita,Zapan and those who are at their level of cyberization still have their brain and spinal cord.

So they can feel love and be loved in return, in fact that's was a plot point in volume 5.

The falling for the mark, or love redeeming is an old,old plot.

> Let me explain what i meant in regards to the ending:

> She became the most powerful weapon system in that world. She is unstoppable by everything and just learned that Nova betrayed everyone and anyone, even his loyal muppets who represent him down there (getting killed and not send up). It was very clear that nobody will every make it up alive because Nova much prefers ""human organs"" above anything. Alita knowing even more about his evil ways from hundred years ago and has programmed this mission into her core to defeat him.

 > Seeing all of this in front of her, and her buddy dying, she then makes a 90° turn by trying to earn an ""elevator ticket"" by participating in an orchastrated sports event, lead by the evil man himself?

> How on earth would Alita actually belive that this will work. That ticket will be worthless. No way Nova will just invite her up to allow her to kill him, right? Will never happen. Nova controls everything and everyone. She has to use her power and enter by force.

> But then to leave to play Motorball is just living within Novas world and completely going against everything that has made her who she is.

Some dialogue like, ""you are not deserving of such a sword"" or ""I need you to stand way back"" does seem out of place, but it was justified that she was gaining her memories from 300 years ago prior. 

So in a way, it could be that alita was the mature one, perhaps in 30s and Hugo is the 15 yr old.

As far as alita's heart replacement, she was hoping that the money that can be gained from it would allow her to go to zalem with Hugo too. She just wants to be together with Hugo and was excited that he didn't have much left since it would allow her to go at the same time. It did seem impulsive on her end because she offered to help him in bouinties, and then jumped to wanting to resolve everything by selling her core. Yes it's a foreshadow and even prior to when Nova mentioned wanting it. This is something else, but it became about getting her core, from destroying alita completely, and then back again to destroying her, which I found kinda inconsistent. The two are different, maybe it's either or?

I think it should be appreciated that replacing parts as a cyborg in this culture would seem like a common thing to do. I don't see it as a big self harm, but it would certainly be a downgrade.

I think there are too many sides to alita, but my impression as to why she likes Hugo can be traced back to the first interaction. Love is mysterious sometimes. Maybe he reminds her of someone in her past, subconsciously, who knows. And I don't think the movie particularly need to explain love. It just happens. They were very close in the beginning and seemed natural to me. I don't know if alita would fall in love with any dude that shows her the town, but the initial interaction felt unique to me.

>Well, bigger than when she started. Having any boobs at all makes absolutely no sense for a war machine, so the only viable explanation is that this is fanservice.

Ugh, the manga is one of the most successful at making a female lead much more than objectified fanservice. Movie also doesn't run away from her body. She is a human first and foremost. Imitating human body is something Ido did first, then she did it subconsciously with nanotech body. That's how she wants to appear, who she wants to be no matter the nature of her condition - woman. Now, that's some statement. She's gonna have boobs whether you like it or not.

The manga celebrates feminine form as much as it celebrates/mocks male one at points. If growing up is something we shouldn't include in the entertainment and there are people who're turned on by a body, or think there's some unholy agenda behind it all, I'm at loss for words. 

Minor detail I know for sure, that's also included in the novelisation and is visible by the naked eye in the final shots of Alita's face - her face changes structure too, it gains sharpness of an adult face.",aoc6mr

It’s almost kind of comical when she’s trying to give Hugo her antimatter heart, or when she’s shouting at him about him having a bounty on his head. It doesn’t come off that she’s brain damaged, it comes off that the scene and dialogue were cringe-inducing and cliche. What I’m trying to get at is, the movie didn’t feel like it was actually written to that level of subtlety. Maybe it was like that in the original manga, but here it just didn’t work for me.


She's acting like an impulsive,teenage girl, who's head over heels.

The brain damage at least gave her amnesia,but other possible damage is left to inference.



> 
Did they really need to have that character kill the dog to know he’s remorseless? It’s the third introduction of that character to us when we see him kill the dog, and it’s the second time that Alita meets him. We already met the dude from when he was working with those serial killer cyborgs in the beginning and talking about wanting to kill Alita, and again when he limped his way back to the Factory and was screaming bloody murder to Cherin and Vector about wanting to kill Ido and Alita. At the point of the bar scene, I already kinda figured he was pretty much an evil, violent asshole.


I'd say that the adverse reaction is exactly what the dog's death was meant to provoke. 


> 
It’s totally doable to have the Kick The Dog moment and not actually kick the dog, and even get some storytelling bonuses like showing Alita stopping the guy from killing the dog and launching straight into the fight. Actually killing the dog feels gratuitous and unnecessary, especially since Alita kinda just stands there waiting for him to do it while he’s aiming his knife chain hands at the thing? That part felt especially awkward to me. Maybe this gets pulled off better in the manga.


Gratuitous,graphic violence is one of manga's selling points.

Lifeforms meet ugly ends.  



> Re: adapting of a serial, episodic story to a single movie or even trilogy of movies, I think that can run really poorly in a lot of cases. There’s a lot of pressure from the studios to set up sequels using the source material’s expansive story and world, but can end up just making the first movie a bloated mess if it tries to stick too faithfully to the original story plotting. See the aforementioned example of ATLA movie, or more recently I’ve heard Mortal Engines fell into similar problems.


I think ATLA failed not because of what was done but how, it was a nice condensation of season 1.

ATLA had all the pieces but put them together wrong.


From Mortal Engines book fans the since I get is that they changed to much, largely to make the girl the lead and give an up beat Hollywood ending. 


Alita is not what I would have done.

The film would have ended Alita depressed over Hugo's death and running away from home.


I find what was done ""functional"".

On the off chance that Alita does well  enough for a sequel it's going to be real interesting to see how the story is written.

Because by changing so much, they have to essentially write an almost entirely new story.

> Re: Nova, it’s not so much we need the big bad to die in the first movie, it’s more that during the second half of the movie I realized that they were trying to turn this into a series of movies and they weren’t going to finish any of the story threads I was actually interested in during this movie, like why URM was fighting Zalem 300 years ago, who Nova is and how he got into power, etc. It’s why I’m probably going to go read the original manga, since I’m really intrigued by those things and want to see how it turns out, and I get the feeling the movie probably won’t get the sequels it needs to tell the rest of the story.


The current episode did end.

The implication in the films is that Urm regarded Nova as enough of a threat that they were willing scorch the earth, just to get him.

One film couldn't hold the story of Nova, maybe Alita's first encounter with him?

The most interesting thing about Nova in the films to me is that they seem to have combined him with a character from the second series ""Last Order"" ,   Aga ""Trinidad"" Mbadi.",aoc6mr

Despite feeling long, it was rushed and poorly handled. 

I really wanted to like it. It honestly has great potential and visually it was stunning. I was left feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied by all of the relationships in this film, and so was my daughter. We didn’t get any depth with alita and her father, or the boyfriend, the boyfriend and his gang. We honestly don’t even get much depth as to why she’s going after the antagonist.

Also, Vector had a mind-controlled chip implanted in his brains, so Nova could override whatever motivation Vector might have.  Also, it was shown that Vector greatly feared Nova, and fear could be a powerful motivator for obedience.  

The bigger problem was Nova had almost no screen time and was only revealed, quite abruptly, at the end of the movie.  However, I read that was really the fault of the original materials.  The film supposedly stayed faithful to the original materials, and in the original materials Nova was revealed much later in the manga.  

I know anime and manga have a lot of Japonophile fanboys and fangirls.  Frankly, I have always felt that even though anime and manga presented some interesting ideas, they had always been somewhat underwhelming and weak in the narrative and storytelling aspects, (compared to really good Hollywood movies; Hollywood is really world-class best and number-one in terms of storytelling.)  When a Hollywood production tried to be *faithful* to an anime or manga for a live-action adaptation, it inevitable fell into the trap of adapting a narrative and storytelling that was underwhelming and weak.  That is why it felt that Hollywood has ""failed to make a good live-action movie based on anime/manga"" - Hollywood did not fail.  The problem is the original materials.  

It is the same problem with video games, most of which have shallow characterization and underwhelming stories.  For example: all the Halo fanboys have wanted to see a live-action adaption of their favorite video games, but the fact is Master Chief is a shitty, shallow character with no depth, and the stories of Halo are actually underwhelming and uninteresting Biblical allegories.  The video games are fun to play, but I already know a ""faithful"" movie would suck because the characterization and stories from the video games just ain't that good.

Yes, it would be better to know the specifics, but the ending doesn't leave it open. We know what he plan is and can understand the idea. 

In the Matrix Neo ends the movie by calling the machine and letting them know that he is going to free others and fight them wherever he can. We don't need to see it happen to understand the general idea of where his story would go from there even if there is no sequel. 

Contrast that with Empire Strikes back where the film ends with Han Solo kidnapped, Luke losing a hand, and an unsure future of any of it. There is a sense of incompleteness to that. Or with the Avengers Infinity War which was not advertised as being a Part 1 (although many people figured it would be) and ended with half the world destroyed. Again it leaves it off with no indication on how the heroes plan to go on from there and we are left incomplete.

But he comes back in this less than human form - almost a zombie at that point, and she knows that he's been used to emotionally manipulate her. She also knows that her purpose is to destroy Nova - but while Hugo and Ido are around, she can be manipulated. She tells Nova to bring it - of course that means that he's going to kill them. Now Hugo is dead, her resolve strengthened and one of the emotional weak points is removed.

It's not a 'she's doing it for her lovey dovey'. It's a 'she's fulfilling her destiny - but it's going to be painful for her' thing.

Of course, they could've conveyed it better - but it's not like they didn't write and allude to all that either - it just seems like you either missed it, or you're overfocusing on one element to the exclusion of the rest.

I wouldn't say a misstep in one area makes everything else moot - what I suppose it does say about you is that... you actually were engaged emotionally with the movie - but kinda got hurt when it did something you didn't like (i.e. ham fisted romance) - kinda like how they say that the opposite of love isn't hate - it's disinterest.

Thankfully Gunnm made an OVA in 90'	s and  Cameron studied it hard for reference. Tt really helped him to keep its originality as raw as possible.  Turns out the result is not flawless for sure. Motivation of Hugo isnt well explained to establish his character.  Shiren's swapping sides from bad to good is weird af either.  Also the supporting attitude of Dr Ido on Alita to play motorball totally destoryed his background,  which is a shame.  However these flaws did not hurt the backbone of Alita self developing.

The story at this moment is about Alita's experiences.

In the manga she didn't have a central quest until volume six and the story in general was rather episodic.

The romance was dumb teenage love, and was never going ""deep"", ""dark"", ""rich"", ""mature.

Plot wise the romance is actually much improved from the source  where Alita was a stage-6 clinger that Hugo just kinda liked.


You need to just embrace the crazy inherent in the premises.

I think that this need for sci-fi fantasy to be ""grim"" , ""gritty"",""realistic"" is killing western sci-fi fantasy.

I feel like the point of the Hugo arc in the original is that Alita is still a naive hormonal teenager at this point, and that Hugo is intentionally unlikeable, but Alita is still infatuated him anyway.

And we feel bad for Alita, not because it was a real romance, but because it was a Break The Cutie moment.

I think James Cameron wanted to make Hugo likeable to make Alita less of a dumbass for wanting to save him, so they changed his motivations, made him less of a jerkass, and made him actually care for Alita. It worked for me, but then again, I'm familiar with the original, and I willingly bought into the Hugo arc in the movie because I knew it was going to be an important arc. That said, I can see how for people unfamiliar with the movie, it seemed unnecessary and forced. Maybe with a few small writing tweaks, an extra scene or two, and an actor who could sell it, it might have worked for general audiences.

I feel like the writers knew what they were doing. The ""I give you my heart"" scene was cringe-inducing, but the scene is very self-aware and emblematic of the Alita's relationship with Hugo as a whole.

Alita wasn't necessarily emotionally different, that's just her personality (myers-briggs INFP if I had to guess). She still had a human brain, after all. In the manga she was a crazy little gutsy sweetheart who lived to fight and was unconscionably brave, very introspective and idealistic, and truly cared for people. I think Rosa Salazar did an amazing job, as did the writers, because they really nailed her character for the most part.

Ido seemed less involved in the manga than the movie, although in the manga at the point when she storms off because he won't let her become a hunter-warrior, he realizes he is being ridiculous and changes his mind, giving her her freedom to do as she pleases. I can't remember if they go into his backstory very much in the manga...? It's been years since I read it. ",aoc6mr

[So, Zalem is basically a utopian society run by an AI. The people up there, for the most part, aren't even really aware of the junkyard, they just live idyllic lives. Eventually, Alita makes it up there, and so does Nova (who is not in Zalem in the manga, he's an outcast like Ido). Nova, who is kind of a sinister guy in the movie, is a fucking lunatic in the manga. He's the definition of a cackling mad doctor, except with grotesque body horror stuff. Anyway, at one point while she's up there, Nova gets on the main communication channel in Zalem. He appears on every screen in the city, and reveals the secret of Zalem:](#spoiler) 

[So, you know that little gem thing that Jennifer Connelly, Nova, and Ido have on their foreheads? Citizens of Zalem get that when they turn 18 (I think it's 18), and become full citizens of Zalem. When they turn 18, they go to the central AI and get the little symbol/gem thing implanted. It's considered a pretty big deal up there, like coming of age. Except nobody (aside from Nova) has realized what's actually going on.](#spoiler)

[This is the big spoiler. You're warned.](#spoiler)

[On the screen, Nova takes a hacksaw and slices the top of his own skull off (along with several other people whom he has taken captive). He pops the top off and leans down, showing the inside of his skull to the camera. His brain has been removed, and in its place is a small microchip. He reveals that every adult citizen of Zalem has had the same thing done to them. The central AI makes a copy of their brain, puts it on a microchip, implants it in their skull, and incorporates the real brain into itself. Every adult person in the city is a copy of their previous selves. The chip also includes a limiter, which prevents people from realizing that they're not really in control of Zalem, and that the AI is. Anybody who finds out the secret is immediately killed by the city's automated defense system. What follows is total chaos, as the entire city is plunged into a simultaneous existential crisis. Mass suicides, roving bands of psychopathic adults trying to kill people below 18, people being massacred by the defense system, etc. It's pretty gnarly.](#spoiler)",aoc6mr

In terms of comics - I'd recommend Appleseed (especially if you liked GitS). It's got great action, big ideas AND Cyborgs!

Also Kishiro was clearly influenced by 1980s 2000AD - so maybe look for some old school Judge Dredd, Slaine (nice Makaku link there) and Rogue Trooper etc. You can't go wrong with old 2000AD really.

To your other points, as I mentioned previously, I feel that the discussion of staying true to source material, warts and all, is a slightly different conversation than a review of the movie in general, which is worth bringing up. So...

How much should movies based on a previous source material revolve around that source? Should creative liberties be taken? How do you make a movie that honors the fans AND the general public? And, the bigger question I'm probably getting to, how do we retell stories that in and of themselves have some pretty big flaws? If what some of the other commenters have said is true- that some of the criticism applies to the original work itself- how do we handle that? 

I'm of the opinion that if the original work had some fairly large shortcomings, new works should improve upon it, rather than copy exactly. Again, not having read every single manga, I am not as familiar with the source material... but would you say the core of the character is too entwined with the ""born sexy and badass yesterday"" vibe to have any chance at being written differently?  Would the movie have been better if, for example, Alita had wisened up much faster? If she had been more empowered not just by physical abilities and appearance, but intelligence and maturity, too?

Alita has forsaken her mission in favor of a relationship with  Hugo.

Yah. I think it should be closer to something in the line of Star Wars or Hunger Games. This movie is basically Luke becoming a pod racer and ends when he meets Han when they are trying to get off Tatooine. I think there is potential for a story like that to work, but I wouldn't want that over the story we got, which is why I would rather see Alita go down a more tried and true path instead of sticking to source material that wasn't designed with a film adaptation in mind.

I guess there is nothing wrong with lethal roller derby, but the rules made absolutely no sense. What is the point of the ball if you get points by killing/disabling your opponent? What is the point of being in the front? It just puts a target on your back. Better to just hang in the back and look to pick people off. As a person that has played a lot of sports this frustrates me. Visually it was impressive, but I couldn't shake that annoyance, and that is a personal me problem, not necessarily a movie problem.

Again, how did she grow as a result of having a relationship with Hugo? Maybe it makes sense as a storytelling device when you have to fill out a weekly or whatever story, but now you need to transition this story to a different medium and the fat needs to be cut. What is essential about this story? The only thing I can tell that is essential about it is that it gives her a reason, revenge, to go to Zalem. Her flashbacks were already giving her that reason. Her encounters with a corrupt system were giving her that reason. Cyborgs, people just like her, having their parts harvested for either the gladiator games, or Zalem gives her a reason. The love story is unnecessary, and frankly makes me think less of her for it since months have now passed and she apparently hasn't developed as a person beyond those first few experiences she had after being woken up.

I have read or watched a lot of stories, and while I am by no means an expert in the subject I feel like I have a good understanding of what makes for dynamic characters and storytelling. This movie has neither. It hints at Alita being a dynamic character when she says, ""I do not stand by in the presence of evil,"" but that isn't the theme of her character. She seems much more motivated by her emotions, in this case love (or what I would call infatuation) and revenge. Good characters are good because they live by codes, and the results of when they stick to or break those codes is what makes for good storytelling. ",aoc6mr

Okay, i could accept that. Nova has shown signs of an insane narcissist who would probably be so full of himself to allow her up, cause he thinks he'd still be in control. Her suit could be an element of surprise could lead to success. 

However, he was portrayed as an ""all seeing eye"" who can jump from body to body of implanted people and see and talk through them. There's a high chance he already seen her in the Beserker suit, and he lived back then during the war, so he knows what that means: a big threat!

I still think this Motorball is an odd detour to take. The attack of Zalem should have been in the first movie. There is no point in waiting.

egr280q,"> the interaction at the bar scene indicates that she really matured

I felt the opposite, actually. IIRC the bar scene plays like this : she enters the bar, Hugo freaks out, they meet Zapan, Zapan presents himself as some kind of ""primus-inter-pares"" among the hunter-warriors, delivers a speech about how every H-W works alone, and nobody in the room contradicts him. 

*Then*, despite the fact that everybody here is obviously 1) in agreement with Zapan or 2) frightened by him, Alita somehow imagine that she will be able to convince them to prove Zapan wrong and fight with her. Yeah of course the ensuing brawl is badass, and she certainly showed that she is quite brave, but it doesn't strike me as a very ""mature"" move. Even if her goal shifted mid-scene from convincing the H-Ws, to beating them into submission, it's not a very wise plan.

> As far as alita's heart replacement, she was hoping that the money that can be gained from it would allow her to go to zalem with Hugo too.

That's a valid objection, but I guess I didn't really feel the urgency of the situation. If Alita wanted to join Hugo on Zalem, she could have earned the money thanks to the bounties : Hugo is young, so he had to work for a few years max to collect the money, and all he could do were low-salary jobs ; while Alita is arguably the most powerful being in the city, can take down the most searched criminals on the lists and probably collect the money much faster than him. Besides, if she could replace her heart that easily, the symbolic reach of the scene diminishes : why can't she sell her lungs instead ? Or her eyes ? Or her feet ?

> my impression as to why she likes Hugo can be traced back to the first interaction.

I can understand why Alita likes Hugo (he's a good guy), but it's the opposite that I find weird. Hugo spends his time introducing her to people and showing her the town, but I didn't feel like she brought anything new to his life in return. She's just here, being cute and kinda dumb. So I can't help but think that Hugo ends up with her only because she's cute and ""nice"", but she has fucking *amnesia* and it's a bit weird to me to see him dating a much less mature *and* basically mentally-impared girl just because of that. I mean, I can understand it I guess, but I find it a bit creepy nonetheless and that doesn't make the character very relatable to me.

But from the adaptation side of things, I mean...wow. When I watched that scene, I was thinking, “it would be really trite for this movie to kill the dog to try to make us feel angry at this guy we already think is a dick.” And then they go ahead and do it.

And the thing is, Alita wasn’t helpless there, right? She just showed off how badass she was in that amazing bar fight. Then when the evil dude waltzes in and casually threatens the dog, she just stands there watching. She absolutely could have stood up there, but the film has her wait until the dog died, and then solemnly bend down to paint her face with the blood to show how badass she is. At any point she could’ve just started attacking the guy before he killed the dog.

Just to reiterate, I’m talking strictly about the movie’s delivery. The movie already sorta shows that Alita is the only one willing to stand up for good in a jaded cynical world in the bar when she calls out all the bounty hunters. Maybe it was better delivered in the original manga, but if it was, I definitely didn’t get the impression it was adapted well.

That's because this a Prologue.

The source materiel is the same, movie adapts the first three maybe four volumes with one plot point pulled forward to create a big bad.

Until volume six there was no one central plot, it was Alita's daily life which consisted of many smaller plots strong together.  

The story as a a whole drip feeds us information, especially Alita's history.

We are close to thirty years, two complete series and six volumes into a third and still we do not know everything.


>  it feels to me as if the producers and director didn’t even care all that much about the story, and were more concerned about the effects and visuals.


They did care about the story, some of the issues are that the pace they are hitting as many of the plot points as possible to convey a lot of material in a short span of time.

A slower pace would have left more time for the audience to soak in the moments, but then peop;le would have said that the story lagged.

Other things might be do to difference in story telling tradition between the Japanese and western.

Because this film does feel like the manga.

That is a completely different circumstance to a movie doing a cliff hanger while also being the very first movie in the series. That's almost unheard of because of movie politics. There may not be a second movie if the first movie doesn't make bank. The second movie might also be super underfunded if it's made because of the first movie not making enough money. A lot of behind the scenes stuff. 

To be clear though. I'm not arguing about the setup itself. You are right that the movie ends with a cliffhanger that may upset people and make them expect an other movie to be resolved. 

My point is that it is much harder to expect a second movie from a first movie compared to expecting a second movie from a sequel. Also that there is a much bigger chance of a second movie not being made in this case compared to movies like The Empire Strikes Back. ",aoc6mr

All of Hugo’s plot would have made sense if he had died at the hands of the bounty hunter. It would have given her motivation and drive while showing her that she cannot save everyone and not to throw herself 100% into everything. Because they resurrected him and caused him to die because of his own hubris/lack of awareness/Nova, it lessens the impact SO much more. She’s gets the “lovers death” storyline without it being her fault. She tried to convince Hugo to come down off the pipe but he didn’t listen in time. Maybe if the ending wasn’t so rushed they could have expanded on her feelings after that (all we saw was she was sad).

For herself, she gets a brand new ultra powerful body. This doesn’t stop her from being reckless or throwing herself into danger. Hugo being stabbed by the bounty hunter is again and not being saved would have been the perfect consequence for this, but instead they give him a horrible green screen body and do away with him.

The main antagonists are still out there and directly personified, not just a vague sense of machines. We don't even see her succeeding in becoming motorball champion. It's dangling.

Plot devices for their own sake are simply not good story-telling. They have to be rooted in character or theme. If the story is shallow to begin with, or is done for the sake of pure entertainment, as the example of  the Rabbit's Foot from Mission Impossible, a literal mcguffin of which details we never get to hear, then fine.

there's no way to get to Tiphares (or, i guess, Zalem in the movie?); people are just being exploited. Tipharean's view those in the Scrapyard (Iron City?) as trash, to be used and exploited, and VERY below them. so, any promises to ascend to the upper city is just a massive, massive bait.",aoc6mr

I hated it. I was so bored. And at least then I knew it was part of a trilogy.

But that flipped with the extended version because it essentially added Borimir's journey character arc.

I found this movie didn't really set up any character arc that was fulfilling. I didn't know it was meant to be a movie series, so I was just watching like any other stand alone movie. If it was a series, I wish the movie made either Grewishka or Vector clearly the end enemy of this movie and made them far more menacing.

I'm still not sure why Nova wants to kill Alita, nor why Alita wants to kill Nova short of revenge at this point.

The motivations aren't clear, and that means my enjoyment in the fights in virtually zero because I have no interest in these characters.

> I think that this need for sci-fi fantasy to be ""grim"" , ""gritty"",""realistic"" is killing western sci-fi fantasy.

I don't need it to be grim. Castle of Cagliostro, Porko Rosso, Steam Boy etc wouldn't be called grim - granted not sci fi. My favourite anime (and I don't watch a lot) so far is PsychoPass. My draw card is story.

I just saw Cap Marvel and short version is it's not perfect but I enjoyed it. Objectively speaking as much as possible, the battle scenes in Alita were far superior. And yet, I'd much rather rewatch Captain Marvel because I care about the story line.

Story elements feel like they’re missing, deliberately so that they can be put in future sequels.

I totally get that it’s really exciting to see your favorite book/cartoon/etc. make it to the big screen with great acting talent, huge special effects budgets, etc., but I just don’t think it worked out here. And I hope people don’t feel like the criticism of the adaptation is necessarily a criticism of the original material, because from the stuff I liked from the movie (the world building, the action, the story ideas), I REALLY like, and I really want to try to find the anime or manga to check out and see where things go.",aoc6mr

I too, never read the Manga, but knew this was an adaptation going in. I can pick out parts where I feel the Japanese culture seep through. 

Certain Creative liberties that might have helped the film:

Hugo/Yugo - should have been much more a tough guy jaded character that may be annoyed at Atila's naivety. That might would have worked better. He is only convinced at her cause after seeing her combat capabilities. But ultimately dies, when he tries to correct course (When he decides not to continue black market part harvesting), and only admitting his love/admiration when he passes. She only offers her heart at this point, which he refuses. (Or if he does take it, when he wake up he tries to make things all better by going up the pipe and rejoin the current movie continuity from here. He still dies).

Hell, it could even be the doctor that finds out Hugo is the part salvager and ended Hugo's life (Doctor finds out all of the parts Hugo's been supplying him had been from the black market). Alita is completely torn at the conflict and remembers the reason why Mars was fighting Nova in the first place. And then whole movie focuses on this Hero vs Society theme by having the Hero vs Parent, and Hero vs Goons feed into the Hero vs Society, with Hero vs War as the backstory.

From this conflict, Alita gains the maturity and intelligence/experience and this completes the required character development for a protagonist in a single film.

Childish and naive, is definitely  not who she was originally...though perhaps off duty she was still bright and bubbly.

Alita isn't a Luke, or Harry Potter, or Neo.

She's closer to Samantha Caine from ""A Long Kiss Good Night"" or Jason Bourne.

Like them Alita has an inferable past of being extremely capable and very different from who she is now. 

The character really doesn't fit the story that you want, at least not without rewriting almost everything.

> Again, how did she grow as a result of having a relationship with Hugo? Maybe it makes sense as a storytelling device when you have to fill out a weekly or whatever story, but now you need to transition this story to a different medium and the fat needs to be cut. What is essential about this story? The only thing I can tell that is essential about it is that it gives her a reason, revenge, to go to Zalem. Her flashbacks were already giving her that reason. Her encounters with a corrupt system were giving her that reason. Cyborgs, people just like her, having their parts harvested for either the gladiator games, or Zalem gives her a reason. The love story is unnecessary, and frankly makes me think less of her for it since months have now passed and she apparently hasn't developed as a person beyond those first few experiences she had after being woken up.

He wasn't there to teach her anything, his role in the story was to be an experience.

He was her first love and in the film a connection to the people.


> She seems much more motivated by her emotions, in this case love (or what I would call infatuation) and revenge. Good characters are good because they live by codes, and the results of when they stick to or break those codes is what makes for good storytelling.

But that's exactly who Alita is, even after growing a lot more she's still a very much feelings first character.


Alita is also trying to fulfill her ""Last Order"".

In the manga strike against Earth was just a military operation.

In the film it's implied that [Nova](#spoiler) was regarded as such a massive threat that Mars was willing to burn all of Earth just to get him.

egrb89f,"I also didn't think hugo was interested in Alita, romantically at first. I think the key point is that Alita is supposedly from Zalem, or that's what Hugo thought the first time they meet. He alluded to this by saying something like... ""If you're from the scrapyard, that must mean..."" without finishing the sentence. Then the scene where the two are on top of the building, he further reinforces this idea that Alita must be from Zalem, and that he really wanted to know what it is like up there. Later, it is implied that Hugo learned that Alita is a relic, and so he went out of his way to spark her memory by showing her the ship, all for the purpose of learning more about his own selfish dream of going to Zalem. It may seem to Alita that Hugo is trying to help her, but I think it can be seen as Hugo trying to help himself, by enhancing his own connection with Alita, knowing that she has connections to his dream. 

Hugo is a good person in the day, but a criminal at night. He knew the grind cutters that he stole was used on Grewishka, which severely hurt Alita. Despite this, he continued to meet with Vector, his only way to Zalem. Hugo's dream was above Alita the entire time, and Hugo only started to change when Alita offered him her heart. I think at that point he realize that he really loved her. He even wanted to start clean by no longer being affiliated with jacking cyborgs. Most probably Vector did not tell Hugo that Alita was being ambushed in the motorball sequence. He could've connected the dots with the whole grewishka act. I don't know if Hugo is smart enough to do that, but he's a guy that has his entire existence so far dependent on Vector promise, so its kind of a grey area here for me. Overall, I think the movie could've presented this dynamic a little more easier. The actor could've shown a little more range in terms of moral struggle or a super strong sense of fulfilling his dream. The movie tries to do this, but it is not completely obvious. 

I don't know if Alita can get a million credits, I don't think its that easy. There's so many scenarios with her, Ido, and Hugo that she may not win through battle alone. 

Well, she could sell her other parts too.  But the thought behind this whole idea wasnt pre-planned or anything. It was just Alita, on the spot, offering it. She knew it was of great value. It would be weird if she thought it through without Hugo on her own that she was going to sell her eyes and feet. And you're right, there's no rush to get to Zalem, except for Hugo potentially going there before Alita. Some of that concern was expressed by Alita, making her pull out her heart. Hugo offered her another way, through motorball, to get to Xalem. It was hitting two birds with one stone, maybe. Fufilling stuff with Vector, and helping Alita get money or become a champion to get to Zalem. Supposedly Motorball is less dangerous than bounty hunting, or at least that's what it should be... I'm not sure.

Yep, the barfight was not a wise plan. It was just the way she talked and engaged seemed like something you do in a military, or war context where a leader would encourage their subordinates to fight.

ehmcnao,"Heya, bit of a late reply but this is coming from someone who read the manga, So alita's motivation for going after Nova is not just programmed but its literally to save the rest of the surviving Tiphareans (humans) as every new human born under the sky cities had been implanted with those brain control chips that was controlling the two main villains in the movies.

The martians only options where to try and wipe out all the cities to stop nova from literally controlling the entire planet underneath the cities (well not so much control as to them becoming giant guinea pig farms). And it doesn't just stop there he was doing really weird experiments in the pursuit of some kind of weird cosmic karma setup (Sort of like trying to rid the universe of karma or ""Cure"" karma from existing as well as some convoluted cure for thermodynamics, particularly heat death) So the experiments he was doing was to force people into situations that could experiment on their Karmic outcomes, most of the time by causing bad shit to happen sort of like the devil whispering in peoples ears.

You see this at the end of the movie where vector is sending up body parts to Nova, Also just as a side note the story is faithful to the manga with hugo, Basically alita's just a teenager and hugo's just hot. She has amnesia and just attaches herself to the nearest crutch. She does grow out of it later as hugos story is very veeery minor in the manga so much so that i didn't know if they would include it or not.

Also hugo's a dick in the manga, and incredibly immature. even when shes trying to save him from the pipe he's just being a whiney little bitch the entire time. So i hope that gives you some context. Sure their are better manga and stories out there. but this is faithful and it shows promise for the future.",aoc6mr

For those picky audiences,  I highly suggested you guys to watch Attack of the Titans film adaptation made by Japanese.

Alita was a prologue, the source material is much the same volumes 1 through 5 are in retrospect the preamble to what happens in 6 through 9.

We got tall and lanky types like Sherlock (Cumberbatch), muscled Thor (Hemsworth),  nerdy, thinner Hulk (Norton), even to some extent, heavier set men like Green Hornet (Rogan). I mean, look at Black Widow, Scarlet Witch... cleavage, corsets, really? Obviously media and Hollywood put a lot of pressure on men, too, to look a certain way, but I feel like the spectrum is wider than it is for women.

I think the relationships between Ido, Alita, and Chirin was where the interest was. I would have enjoyed seeing that explored more and completely cut Hugo out. We got a bit of it with Ido and his daughter and how it affected his actions toward Alita. We got barely a hint of it with Chirin leaving and stating her motherhood as the reasoning. If it came down to characters needing a death as the primary motivation advancing the story, it would have been more interesting, again, in my opinion, for Chirin, Ido and Alita to grow close relationships together, and then, as a redemption for Chirin, her mending bonds with Ido, and forming closeness with Alita. Later a death of Chirin could become fuel for both Ido and Alita together. 

Instead, it was a very shallow and immature relationship with Hugo that became the motivation and unconvincing reason for her to continue the story. It really annoyed me, too, that it was a big scene saving him (again relying on the ""Alita heart"" tool) only to immediately kill him off. Apparently him dying for her once wasn't enough. They had to beat this unfulfilling relationship drama over our heads twice!

So scrap Hugo. A more solid Ido and Alita pairing would have been more interesting. Ido already said he was born there, we already knew Alita had been previously tasked with taking down Nova, so the two of them sharing their rage, grief, and revenge together would have been a more satisfying adventure, imo.

Right. My point is, her mission is of no personal consequence UNTIL Hugo's death. A good character must be driven by a personal catalyst. Killing Nova just because Alita has been programmed to is weak. It's when she actually invests her emotions in his death that she becomes relatable. Alas, her personal motivation is fueled by a stupid romance. That's my point. Her motivations are weak because her relationship with Hugo is weak. Rushed, contrived, unbelievable. And that's on the movie, not the manga.

egqo7g3,"I don't think the childishness is a contrast, simply the free time she now has. Naivety in child soldiers would be nothing revolutionary. We also have no context to the URM/Earth war, and the final operation that URM led. Based on the movie I am led to believe that URM's strike against the sky cities was in retaliation to Mars being essentially wiped out, so saying she participated in one of the greatest acts of murder in history seems kind of disingenuous if it is in response to one of the other greatest acts of murder in history.

I am not saying she should be Luke or whomever, simply her story should more closely align with theirs. I also don't think your comparisons to Caine or Bourne are accurate. They didn't embrace who they were initially. Alita revels in violence and the ways of the past that she can't remember. It is very different from how those two characters act.

If she isn't learning from experiences she is a bad character. He is her first love that we know of. There is no reason she couldn't have had one during her time at URM. She also could have had plenty of connections to the people through Ido and the people that were having their cybernetics stolen and coming to him for help. The people of Iron City don't seem especially miserable. Just trying to live life. Hugo and Ido's wife are the only ones shown to really want to get away. Hugo is a bad representation of the population at large.

If she is always a feeling first character she isn't going to be a good character. People don't sympathize well with characters that adhere to their every whim. It isn't realistic.

Good point, I hadn't thought about that. It's still a bit creepy/weird (at least it really shows how obsessed Hugo is), but it's interesting.

To be honest the problem I have with Hugo isn't that he is uninteresting (because as you say he's actually interesting), it's that his relationship with Alita feels very, erm, uncritical (for lack of a better word ?). Alita doesn't have a lot of personality at the beginning, besides being naive and enthusiastic : or at least, that's what we're shown. So we feel that Hugo either likes her primarily because, as I said, she's cute and dumb, or, as you said, because she reminds him of Zalem. Your idea is more interesting, but it's still a bit creepy, a bit unhealthy, which is actually pretty exciting and I would have liked to see their relationship framed this way. 

Instead, they form some kind of perfect couple : he's very nice to her, very patient, and he even tries to repent before his fight with Zapan, just because he loves her (despite the fact that he needs the money !). It's too ""clean"", and it's a shame. I'm not saying that Hugo should have been framed as an abusive asshole or something like that - but there was room to make this storyline more nuanced.

> There's so many scenarios with her, Ido, and Hugo that she may not win through battle alone.

If anything, I'd say the bar scene *proves* that she *believes* she can overcome any given obstacle if she beat it hard enough (which is more-or-less true tbh).

> But the thought behind this whole idea wasnt pre-planned or anything.

Yeah, I guess that's what bothers me. She's so hotheaded, compared to Hugo who has been thinking about his dreams for years and is much calmer. He's actually creeped out, he doesn't even really thinks about taking the heart. It really felt like he's frightened by how devoted Alita is, even though that's her absolute main characteristic throughout the movie. How can he be weirded out now ? She's just doing Alita things, business as usual. Her enthusiasm didn't prevent him from dating her in the first place.

> It was just the way she talked and engaged seemed like something you do in a military, or war context where a leader would encourage their subordinates to fight.

Yeah but there's the context. Giving pep talks is a thing, but giving one to post-apo, solitary, borderline psychopathic mercenaries is another. I could be wrong, but I thought she genuinely expected some results, and that people would care about her problem - which wasn't going to happen.",aoc6mr

2 of 3 authors are male, so is the director, they are part of a gigantic industry, and it would be somewhat naive to presume that they portrayed a woman just as women portray themselves, and don't have any financial interests whatsoever. It's all fine and dandy about being sexual etc., I don't even object to porn and I enjoy erotic imagery just like the next guy. I still think that this is essentially the portrayal of a little girl with big eyes - even if she kills without remorse (that's a universal manga trope) - even at the end of the movie. THAT is the creepy aspect, not the boobs on their own.

Boobs fine. Boobs on minors, not so much. That's my position.

There needs to be something that challenges/brings suffering for the hero to overcome. She can't be challenged physically, which leaves her emotions to be challenged. Otherwise, it would be like the standard superman problem. Hero is normal. Hero finds out they have powers. Hero goes on a quest to defeat the baddies with new found powers. Hero beats baddies. Very bland.

Also with Hugo it allows the audience to explore the city from a different perspective, which gives it the big world feeling.

My original suggestion might placate Fans of the series, and general audience. As far as I can tell, Hugo was oblivious to Alita's romantic interests in Manga as well, (Someone correct me if I'm wrong) which makes this a bad Hollywood love interest shoehorn.

Killing Nova just because Alita has been programmed to is weak. It's when she actually invests her emotions in his death that she becomes relatable. Alas, her personal motivation is fueled by a stupid romance. That's my point. Her motivations are weak because her relationship with Hugo is weak. Rushed, contrived, unbelievable. And that's on the movie, not the manga.


This may be a fault of pulling Nova forward to create a big-bad where none was originally.


A protagonist not getting involved until something they love is threatened or some other event forces them into action is basic story telling.


Alita x Hugo, is dumb,teenage,puppy love.

The most common portrayal of the elite, super-soldier/assassin is focused and cold blooded.


Also with the film showing current Alita as so childish,naive and earnest,  it can be inferred  that her original personality is something  very different.



> We also have no context to the URM/Earth war, and the final operation that URM led. Based on the movie I am led to believe that URM's strike against the sky cities was in retaliation to Mars being essentially wiped out, so saying she participated in one of the greatest acts of murder in history seems kind of disingenuous if it is in response to one of the other greatest acts of murder in history.


Ware are you getting Mars being wiped out and the raided on Earth being a relation?

The movie implies that Alita's squad and maybe the entire assault was to get at Nova.

* Which ties into the manga because Alita's team were sent to raid Zalem. She was [captured tried,convicted, sentenced death...by ejection into space](#spoiler). 


I actually suspect that if we get sequels URM will be made into the 
""good guy"" faction.


If things stick to the manga, then not only will neither earth or mars be good...the other factions won't be good either.

>  am not saying she should be Luke or whomever, simply her story should more closely align with theirs. I also don't think your comparisons to Caine or Bourne are accurate. They didn't embrace who they were initially. Alita revels in violence and the ways of the past that she can't remember. It is very different from how those two characters act.

I meant Luke,Harry, and Neo as type of archetypal hero.

Alita is closer to Samantha Caine or Jason Bourne than Luke;In fact she's the same type of character.

The innocent amnesiac who retains some of their prior life's skills and instincts, and was both more capable and of darker demeanor in their original life. 


> If she isn't learning from experiences she is a bad character. He is her first love that we know of. There is no reason she couldn't have had one during her time at URM. She also could have had plenty of connections to the people through Ido and the people that were having their cybernetics stolen and coming to him for help.

It's fine for the themes to be interpreted in contradictary ways be different people.

Life is often filled with apparent contradictions - each individual has to make up their own mind how to regard the information and make it consistent within their own mind (or otherwise ignore the contradiction).

While Alita's humanity is an important theme, to me it's subservient to her growth towards her destiny - which is one that goes beyond what a mere human can achieve.

The setting and movie lends itself to discussion of humanity and transhumanism - how human are cyborgs? They can be very human - but also very inhuman as we see in the movie. It's not a case that being a cyborg automatically makes one less or more human - but certainly, it has a tendency to increase the distance between a 'natural human' and an 'other/extra/trans' human.

So in that sense, I don't see any contradiction in how hugo's transformation into a cyborg is a signal to the viewer that the initial love interest of Alita has being turned into something darker - less puppy love, less 'human' (literally).

Even at the end - Hugo barely clinging on - his form is no longer human; just a torso and stump; injuries that are completely fatal to humans - further help to create distance between the original human form of that love interest and the progression and 'drop' of that love interest to fuel her growth/steel her resolve.",aoc6mr

A contrast between the original and current personalities  of an Amnesiac is a trope.

Just as the super-soldier/assassin being cold blooded is a trope.


Alita has reverted back to her pre war personality.

It isn't until the third series ""Mars Chronicle""  that we get clear images of Alita's childhood.

Alita has always been, inquisitive,caring,mischievous,precocious, and playful.

What Amnesia did was give Alita back her innocence.

Between Alita's recruitment as a child by the practitioners Panzer Kuunts, a private military force in the manga, and Martian Special forces in the film, and her last mission the raid on Zalem, her life remains a blank.

But the bits of Alita that we see during the war in the manga, we know that she turned cold and ruthless; which falls in line with the tropes of her character.


>  So if Mars isn't wiped out why wouldn't they have made sure they finished off Nova? It very much seems like that final mission was a suicide mission, which I would presume they would only do if they had nothing to live for.
 
This I can't answer because they've changed the political landscape of setting.

In the manga...

* We don't get off planet until the second series Last Order.

Things are in a state of tense equilibrium between the powers, Earth,Mars which doesn't have a unified government, Venus, Jupiter...with an unknown number of minor settlements scattered across the system.


The attack on Earth was just an attack, it wasn't a last gasp do not go gently into the act by Mars.

In the film you might be right, though the implication is that the Berserkers were after Nova.

Gelda says to Alita/[Yoko](#spoiler) ""He is the dragon that you must slay"".

The source material drip feeds information two complete series, six volumes into a third over close to thirty years and we still don't have a complete picture.

Leaving things to be infired by the audience is supposed to be good writing.

So I'm pleasantly surprised that someone dislikes the practice.

I think the film writers are trying to set up questions to be answered later...which may never come.

Because Alita is crushing on him hard, it's  a story through her eyes.

Hugo is an objectively bad person, may have been  planning to chop Alita up for spare parts and in the manga definitely, he lives to fulfill the dream of his dead older brother and is willing to do horrible things to that end. Once Hugo gets a moment of clarity...he dies for good.

* His con in the manga was to pose as a maintenance worker, then turn chop shop once the cyborg can't escape or fight back.

Hugo wasn't supposed to be the love of her life dude who'll be with her through thick and thin.

Alita's real love...will show up later.

Nova for his own reason chose to let her go, which is a very Nova thing to do.

Alita does physically and mentally mature after being installed in the Berserker.

While still temperamental Ailta is after both because he was screwing with her current life and her Last Orders were to hunt down Nova.

And claiming you have no imagination is not telling you what you thought. I am merely explaining that when you see a doctor and wonder how they cut off someone's head, I suggest you think of possibilities. Amazing that you hate the movie so much because of that one very minor thing XD

You even see the doctor walk out with her bag. So it isn't like she pulled them out her ass, like you do with your terrible mindset.

Sure. Characters were sooo one dimensional, the graphic novel it is based on is rolling in its grave. In fact, the movie actually did a great job making the characters (some) more likeable and have more dimension, but you wouldn't care because you already painted the movie one way and are so vapid you just agree 100% with critics instead of actually really dissecting the characters to see if they are so one dimensional as you say.

Without the weight of a war I am sure her natural personality has risen to the top, but it didn't seem especially subdued based on the limited knowledge I have been exposed to.

That doesn't even make sense in the manga. Like they made the attack and then didn't do any follow up to confirm that they completed their goals? It doesn't seem like Earth has much of a military force now, so there is no reason to not send additional troops in to confirm the mission is complete.

I guess I misspoke there. It is only lazy storytelling if there aren't clear answers planned out. Like the latest Star Wars trilogy. Just setting up a bunch of things to be answered in future films without already knowing the answers is lazy. I just don't see Alita being an epic film franchise ala Harry Potter. I feel like a trilogy is the best Cameron could have hoped for if each film is going to cost $200 million. Having the first movie in a trilogy end with basically nothing explained makes me very worried about future films.

But we aren't given any real reasons why Alita is crushing on him. He is just literally the first person her age she meets. If it is supposed to be a learning moment for her we need to see the after effects it has no her. The timeskip negates much, if not all, of that. If she is the character we are supposed to root for she can't just constantly fall in love with shitty people. She needs to realize her own worth and have higher standards. I don't think that happens unless she has a realization that Hugo was kinda a shitty person. Maybe that can still happen, but the timeskip really fucks that development.

It seems like Alita doesn't change much pre and post amnesia. She is still a violent killer. Still wants to follow her orders.

You clearly havent been paying attention if you think i hate a movie for 1 scene.  The movies pacing is terrible.  The source material has tons of OVAs and manga to develope characters and they cram that all into a single movie you get characters with no time for us to care about them.  I had forgotten all their names as soon as I left the theater, because as soon as you see Hugo 30 seconds later Alita is swooning ... so thats what he was. His name was ""boyfriend"" and every scene after just solidified that.  He served no other purpose because he didnt have time to. I didnt go into the movie wanting to hate it.  I judged it on its merits from an unbiased point of view having never seen the source anime. 
As a stand alone movie its just ""heres this character- her purpose is to be karmic justice (Chirin), heres roller bully whos friends with boyfriend, his purpose is to drive a wedge in this romance. Heres swordman, his purpose is to give his sword to Alita.  Etc .... 

All of this is something that in a show or series has multiple episodes or hundreds of pages to show their other sides but here... they have 1 purpose and its glaringly obvious right when you meet them. 

Now as an action movie its fun.  Its no different than Pacific Rim.  Sure the writing and characters are shit, but its fun to watch robots smash things. That doesnt mean you dont call it out on its crap. 

As a stand alone movie this is crap. And so far you havent bothered to come up with a counter point but feel the need to reply anyway to validate your opinion through others. 
I dont have a psychiatrist degree but things are easy to observe if youre unbiased.  

Like how I could tell you had a bias being a fan of the source material. 

Theres a reason anime doesnt translate to live action... and thats the time they have to build characters. You know what they shouldve done?  Since they are clearly planning a series of movies based on the cliff hanger ending... end the movie in the church and use those extra 20 min to develope your characters more.

> Innocence? She is still a pretty cold blooded killer. 

Children can be cruel.

Alita in her current state is innocent.



>  I didn't get a sense that Alita was especially cold.

That may have changed with the film.

Manga Alita was a member of the Grünthal Mercenary Company who'd been selected to carry out the hit on earth;essentially a suicide mission, for her chances of getting out were very low. 

Movie Alita was a member of Martian Special forces outfit Berserker.

Both were carrying out scorched earth missions.



> That doesn't even make sense in the manga. Like they made the attack and then didn't do any follow up to confirm that they completed their goals? It doesn't seem like Earth has much of a military force now, so there is no reason to not send additional troops in to confirm the mission is complete.


The political situation in the movieverse is different and we don't know what remains of the Earth Sphere,Mars, or if the other powers in the setting even exist in the setting.

It can be inferred that the Earth Sphere survived but was crippled and Mars...stopped for some reason despite seemingly having been on the eve of victory.

It a big mystery.

In the manga the war entered a cease fire after what Grunthal had done was exposed. Most of Earth's government is in space and after the war the surface was basically left to it's own devices.

The manga drip feeds us information  Battle Angel was 9 volumes, Last Order was 14 volumes, Mars Chronicle currently has 6 volumes...

And we still do not have a complete picture.

Even if things have been planned out, as long as the drip feed approach is maintained we aren't going to see the whole picture for a while.


This film along with a few other bits of media are showing me that a lot of writing advice is BS.

Because the film is following some of that advice to the later.

* Don't spell things out for the audience.

* Infer,allude, but do not explicitly state.

* Leave things for the audience's imagination. 



> But we aren't given any real reasons why Alita is crushing on him. He is just literally the first person her age she meets.

He's pretty and was nice to her.

I though flaws made the character, why Alita can't fall for the wrong person?

As for standards, Alita doesn't remember what her's were.

Loyalty and bloodlust are big parts of of who Alita became. 
",aoc6mr
eh8bsu0,"Except I have never read the source material (only 2 chapters) or seen the anime... so... this is awkward.

And again, you're jumping to conclusions. When have I once tried to validate my like for the movie with you? I merely said ""it was actually like this"" and you just don't care. So what am I to do? I tried to explain it, you rebuttaled, you remain unconvinced. Therefore this just isn't ""your"" movie. It happens. Life goes on.

And I have to disagree with your point about 1 dimensional. Some characters I agree. But Alita was extremely layered, as was her and Ido's relationship. I really liked it about the movie, gave it a lot of heart. I personally like heart. So maybe that's why I walked away having gotten more out of the movie than you did. i easily found myself rooting for Alita, as she is this pure and innocent force thrust into this very vile dog eat dog world. But here she stands, realizing she was once a warrior, unafraid to face the darkness.

As we watch the movie, well sorry, as I watched the movie, I felt like I didn't want Alita and her relationship with Ido to be corrupted by Iron City. And in the end, Alita ""lost her heart"" but became once again what she was - a warrior with a mission. In a way, we wonder if the next movie she has regressed to a bloodthirsty warrior, or if like Ido, she killed her lover's killer and didn't find peace. Clearly she is set on going to Zalem to take on Nova, which is, in my opinion, exciting.

Obviously the movie will be lacking. But I think for what the source material was, and what they included, I think they did a great job. I don't think it is as bad as people make it out to be, as long as you aren't going in looking for something too deep. And in that case, let me tell you. It did exactly what the source material did. I haven't read it, but I am familiar enough to know that it really is a dragonball series. It doesn't have ""deep plot"", just battles. And guess what, for an anime to movie, they nailed it. So again, this just wasn't your movie I guess, because you wanted it to be something it just isn't.

Anyways, I have enjoyed our back and forward. But remember, the main point was to be a little more open to possibilities. So it isn't too crazy that Chirin, who is a doctor, would not be carrying around tools with her. Hell, for all we know, Chirin was just as shady as Hugo and maybe would steal shit from people too, thus why it is even more plausible she would have tools.",aoc6mr
ehf8tom,"A manga can drip feed information because it has to artificially prolong its story to make the most money possible. A movie franchise can't do that. People will stop watching the films without a sense of meaningful progression. Again, I don't see a likely scenario before this movie released where Cameron could expect more than three films. Films also need to meaningfully advance the plot and/or characters. This movie did not do that. It was an introduction, but very little meaningful happened. I would compare it to the first Hunger Games. We didn't get introduced to the whole rebellion element in the first movie, but we had self sacrifice, a bit of a love triangle, a meaningful bad guy, and real stakes at the end (the fact that Alita is the most advanced weapon in the world means I never really feared for her once she got her Berserker gear). 

Again I will ask, how has Alita as a character progressed? It is fine if Alita falls in love with the wrong person, it is not fine if we don't see her come to that realization. That means her character had no growth.

A successful adaptation has to exist beyond the source material. I appreciate you adding some details from the manga, but the fact that the movie is so vague is a bad thing. People don't make a $200 million movie to promote manga sales. The movie has to exist as a competent story without the additional information on its own because the vast majority of the audience will never encounter that additional information.

Just thinking about successful franchises and Alita doesn't really follow any of the character development that made them successful. The closest thing I can think Alita relates to is Indiana Jones or Mad Max. Both also revolved around the title character, but Alita diverges from them by having no meaningful secondary characters. The only one is Ido, but who out there is talking about how awesome that character is? I would say the dog bounty hunter is the only likable character outside of Alita herself, and he was onscreen for less than two minutes. The movie needs meaningful companions for her to play off of. The movie needs different characters for fans to get attached to. Not everyone is going to love Neo or Harry Potter, they need Trinity or Ron to draw in a larger demographic of fans.

I actually find people saying that film didn't give enough information about the back story fascinating.


I also thought that people liked character driven stories to.


> . Films also need to meaningfully advance the plot and/or characters. This movie did not do that. It was an introduction, but very little meaningful happened. 

Alita grew up a little and is back on task to fulfill her Last Order.

I suspect that If the film had just started at volume six, it would have been more successful and better reviewed.

All the stuff that people keep saying this movie should have been, all happens later.

But we'd have needed to a lot of flash backs and exposition, to explain who Alita was and why she was roving the wastelands doing the bidding of [Zalem](#spoiler).




> Again I will ask, how has Alita as a character progressed? It is fine if Alita falls in love with the wrong person, it is not fine if we don't see her come to that realization. That means her character had no growth.


Alita grows up a little over the course of the film.

The story was about Alita's experiences it wasn't meant to teach the audience how to deal with the realization that you're would be lover is a terrible person.

* Perhaps it's a weakness of the source material.  

Alita does come to that realization, she's still unwilling to leave him to die though.

> I would compare it to the first Hunger Games.

Alita doesn't get what she wanted most, despite all that power which balances things out.

The heroic conflict arc is raise,cost,fall.

At full power and with back up Alita/[Yoko](#spoiler) failed carry out her original attack  on Zalem.

Which foreshadows that her getting up there again can not end well.

I think that film does work without needing to be familiar  with the manga.

What the film is doing is following writing advice.

It's leaving gaps to create sense of mystery,promising to give details in the future, and gives enough information to provide context for the current events.


What we know about the state of the world is what is relevant to Alita's current events.


> Just thinking about successful franchises and Alita doesn't really follow any of the character development that made them successful. 

Alita isn't that type of character, and this is the opening.

Allot of the story is Alita going it alone.

Figure Four,Koas,Lou,Kayna won't shop until the next film, if it happens.

It was super basic. They made the characters way more compelling with their motivations I found in the movie. I told you, I read the first few chapters, so I could get a sense of characters. And Alita really didn't have a character in the first few chapters of the manga.

There is also the fact that no questions were really answered in Alita. We don't know for sure who the bad guys are. We don't know for sure Alita's origin. We don't know the point of the war. We just know next to nothing about the universe at large. That is bad world building for the start of a franchise.

There is arguably one interesting character in the entire movie, and I would make the argument that she isn't that interesting.

We don't actually know if Alita grew up a little. Her meaningful development occurred offscreen during a time skip. 
>Alita does come to that realization, she's still unwilling to leave him to die though.

But why does she do that? Is it infatuation? Does she even realize that she is putting her own whims over those of the person she loves? Keeping someone alive without their consent is a pretty fucked up thing to do. We don't see her really grappling with the ethical ramifications of her choices. The big conflict is adhering to the Hunter Warriors code, which she promptly destroys one or two scenes later, so that whole conflict was unnecessary. 

No it doesn't balance it out. If the only conflict is Alita having to learn how to deal with disappoint that is stupid. If all Alita has to fear for is not getting exactly what she wants that is an awful story. I would argue that the original attack speaks more to incompetence than anything else. All the other cities were taken down, so it seems like it was just Alita's that fucked it up.

But we don't have a promise of future details being revealed. There is no sequel at this point. We also have no reason to trust the writers since they didn't answer any questions in the first movie. There is no foundation of trust that has been established that shows the audience (me) will get what we want from future films.

Alita is that type of character. She is a protagonist, and the fact that there are no other meaningful protagonists left at the end of the film means she needs to work triple time to make up that. Again, I can think of two successful franchises that revolved around a single protagonist: Indiana Jones and Mad Max, and each of those at least had meaningful characters to play off of in their films, even if those characters weren't necessary for the franchise. Every other successful franchise has multiple likable protagonists. Star Wars, Matrix, Fast and Furious, Hunger Games, Harry Potter, the list goes on and on. Alita is trying something that has never been proven to work. That doesn't seem like a good idea.

Fourth film at the earliest?! You aren't even trying to make this franchise successful. Like I said, the best Cameron could have hoped for at the beginning was a three movie arc.

What we know is enough for the events at hand.

Perhaps character driven was the wrong term, it's focused on Alita and her experiences.

We know Alita was Mars special forces, we know that Alita and the maybe entire Berserker unit was after Nova.

We know that Zalem is the only hanging city to survive the war, and that beneath it is Iron City that supplies.

There different types of protagonist.

So Alita isn't a Luke Skywalker, Neo,Harry Potter, or Katnis Everdeen.

Alita is closer to Samantha Caine or Jason Bourne, than the more common form of hero.

The Alita battle Angel, like the parts of the manga that it adapts is very focused on Alita and to a lesser extent Ido.

Figure Four, Koas ,Lou, Kayna, Bigott Eizenburg, Russel, Den, would show up in film two, because they are present in the later story arcs.

With at least to and a half story arcs to a film,  they'd all mostly show up in  movie 2.

[Zazie](https://battleangel.fandom.com/wiki/Zazie), is from the sequel series Last Order and shouldn't appear on screen until the fourth film.

Why should the story end at the Prologue?


***

This is what the masses wanted...

Has Alita single a massive flash back, that explained the entire history of the conflict between Earth and Mars, put her on the path to hunting Nova, and told her exactly who she was.

Followed by Alita rallying the people to storm Zalem.

Also the revelation that URM wasn't invading they were trying to liberate Earth from the oppression Desty Nova. Making URM and Alita the unambiguous good guy.


But that would have been travesty of the source material.


Personally I'd have either ended the film at Hugo's death or killed Hugo in the first thirty to fourty five minutes then had the rest of it be about motor ball.


The [pragmatic thing to do adaptation wise](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation) would have been to start the film series with adapting Volume six and part of Seven.

Because almost everything that people criticize about Alita Battle Angel, simply isn't present in the later half of the series.
