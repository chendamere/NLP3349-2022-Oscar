f7lko6o,"The main character Jesper reminded me of Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove in good ways. 

Honestly, I think this film scratched an itch for films exactly like The Emperor's New Groove and to a lesser extent, The Road to El Dorado. Likeable characters, well-choreographed physical comedy, and gorgeous character animation.",dws9et

f7lofmg,"I hadn't heard a single thing about this movie until I saw it on Netflix while I was browsing late last night.  I decided to check it out because I liked the animation style, and wow, I totally wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.",dws9et
f7l3p1r,"A cute beautiful looking film

It's a shame it's not getting any buzz",dws9et
f7l5r9p,"My favorite animated movie of the year.  The animation style is beautiful and the characters are very charismatic. Hope it becomes a Christmas classic with the time.
8.5/10",dws9et
f7lgsj0,"Best animated film of the year, hands down. You can’t get any better than quality hand-drawn 2D animation and a simple but effective story about redemption and hope.

Is it okay for me to say that this film felt more Disney-like than anything Disney’s put out in years? I know it’s because director Sergio Pablos worked on animation for some of the films during the Renaissance period, but still. It made me feel nostalgic in a way very few modern films have.",dws9et
f7m1t9l,I want more movies in the traditional style made. This was absolutely gorgeous! Pablos' work at Disney really shown through here.,dws9et
f7mndrv,Beautiful movie. Maryu was the most adorable thing I've ever seen.,dws9et

f7mcj3e,"The wife decided she wanted to watch a Christmas tonight and thought here we go again, another movie i've seen umpteen times then I remembered this came out today. Showed her the youtube clip and so glad she said yes,

Twas myself, wife and 6 year old and then my 15 year came in after 15 minutes to watch it. Was surprisingly good and could watch it again nearer Christmas.",dws9et
f7xmsjm,"As an ex-animator, i can safely say that Klaus has some of the most beautiful and spectacular looking animations, environments, characters and effects i have ever seen. The mix between 2D traditional animation and 3D CGI Lights, really give a stunning aesthetic.

The story is amazing, other than a few clichés (You'll know when you see it), the characters are lovely, although i would have liked a bit more development about them in some occasions. You will laugh, cry and love this movie.

9/10",dws9et
f7lzcdy,Animation and lighting in the film is just incredible,dws9et

f7wjn2d,"Animation

10/10. Beyond 10/10. This movie is a work of art.

Storytelling

8/10. Charming if a bit typical. No significant plotholes but nothing new or surprising, either.

Music choice

5/10. Shit was wack.

Overall

8.5/10, recommend as a MUST WATCH for lovers of all things animation. In terms of a movie itself, it's alright.",dws9et
f8ssxxq,"You'll probably see the plot beats coming a mile away but they're all executed so well it doesn't even matter. Every character is endearing and it really gets to what the Christmas spirit should all be about, good will towards man. 

I have a soft spot for movies about people just being good to each other out of the kindness of their hearts and I shed a few tears watching this movie because of it (I'm also kind of a whimp to be fair). 

And on top of all that, the jokes pretty much all land, the animation style it truly gorgeous and the voice acting is top notch. This is right up there with Arthur Christmas as one of my favorite Christmas movies that I will be watching every year. 

Also side note, WATCH ARTHUR CHRISTMAS PEOPLE!!!",dws9et
f8uwxx3,"It's unfortunate that movies like this no longer get a theatrical release. I get why they didn't release it in theaters, no way could it compete against the monster that is Disney (Frozen II in Nov and Star Wars in Dec). It's a shame though as this movie is a million times better than anything Disney has put out in years.",dws9et
f7w9br4,Disney better watch their backs if Netflix can keep delivering animated stuff of this quality.,dws9et
f7odfqm,[deleted],dws9et
f7p4u8c,Such a good movie. The animation was gorgeous and the little girl Margu stole the show with her cuteness. I hope the lighting SPA pioneered with this film gets picked up by other studios.,dws9et
fa7d1u7,Christ the ending had me blubbering.,dws9et
f7mk7b0,"I just finished it 5 minutes ago. I did not expect myself to be crying from the last 10 minutes. The animation is amazing as well. The plot isn't something new, but it's still good enough to watch. I hope we get to see more 2d films. I loved this movie. 9/10",dws9et
f7o6cdy,"Well, that was lovely. Overall I’d probably give it 8.5/10, it’s definitely going to be one of the better, if not *the* best, Christmas thing netflix puts out this year. The animation was lovely, particularly the backgrounds though I loved the character design, and the writing felt fresh and clever, surprisingly, managing not to rely on tropes too much. Also, I felt like the latter parts of the movie had better pacing than the first parts, but maybe it just took me a little while to get used to the art style and let myself get taken in by the whimsy. Every actor was also great, but the fact that they were famous definitely took me out a little (that’s a nitpick though). And oh fuck, that last scene broke me. The writers are excellent. 
  
My two main gripes would probably be music and general plot, though to me both of those stunk of executive meddling. I’ve found that when I’m watching or playing anything, I have a stronger emotional response to the music than others so perhaps this didn’t matter as much to others, but for me the use of music definitely wasn’t as good as it good be, though ranging from tear-jerking to generic to just straight up out of place. In fact, I’d say that sometimes the music contributed to the bad pacing in the first part of the movie because the later I didn’t feel that same tonal dissonance. The movie first truly gripped me when the first kid got his toy and they had that lovely moving shot... and then just after they played “How You Like Me Now” and I was just like O-O. Though I think the later use of pop songs was better (though not the best),  particularly when Margu got her sled. Then there were occasions when I felt like the score could’ve been from literally any movie and it took me out as well, but similar there was some great stuff too. Again though, it’s not like the *screenwriter* was the one who *desperately* begged to have How You Like Me Now, is it 🙃 
  
My second gripe is with the plot. Now, like I said I think the writing is excellent, but there were just some times when I felt like there were tropes where there didn’t need to be, for example Jesper’s 6000 blowing up in his face. See, I still feel like that must’ve been notes from higher up tho, because the writers just had too many amazing moments for that to be them, imo. Like I said, the ending, but also things like the kids’ relationships, and Alva’s storyline, and Klaus’ backstory, and Margu getting her sled etc.  
  
Despite how much I just wrote about those two things (lol) I still feel like this movie was great, they’re just minor gripes. I would pay to see this movie in cinemas and not be one bit disappointed, which is saying a lot considering what Netflix typically produces. Strong recommend",dws9et
f7nisub,"Nice take on the Santa Klaus myth and the the artistic direction is fantastic. I really like the movie but I have two complaints:

\- The music, mostly forgettable but those moments with modern music were just weird, didn't fit at all with the movie.

\- Ava and Klaus' reactions toward ""the reveal"" of Jasper's motivation. I mean, we knew it were getting here, but that's so cliché and in this particular case, doesn't feel deserved at all. Ava's goal when Jasper arrived in town was to make money so she could leave. So what, he started the gift thing because he wanted to go home. Can you blame him? It's not like he spited to their face and said ""Well, now that my contract is fulfilled, I'm leaving. Ciao losers."" He very clearly wanted to stay but they judged him immediately upon learning his first motivation. Totally dumb and unfair.",dws9et
f7x5kyn,"Klaus is a masterpiece. I'll respect your opinion if you disagree, but god, I love it so much.  I thought the animation was amazing, the storyline was sweet, and the ending made me happy and sad all at the same time.   Sure it was predictable, but it was so wholesome.",dws9et
f9ixiw4,"I was completely blown away by how good this was. Better Christmas movie than Elf. I dunno if it will be in contention for best animated movie but it should be.

It started out with *very* strong Emporer's New Groove vibes (rich sarcastic kid has to experience hardship, ends up becoming a better person, I had to check if the voice actor was different, he is), which holds throughout the movie but it definitely doesn't share the entire plot. Loved every minute of it. 

If there's any justice in the world, this will be the definitive Santa origin story.",dws9et
f83so9l,"As soon as this movie ended, I said out loud ""What a beautiful story"".

I had zero expectations for this and yet I felt it was so well done and exemplified the spirit of the holiday season and truly just a feel good movie. 

Story was so well written and such an incredibly clever way to explain the idea we know of as Santa Klaus.

Animation was rich, the characters were interesting with the right amount of humor, and the character development was at the right pace for me.

You'd have to be a true grinch to not appreciate such a lovely movie. 

Great movie with a lot of heart. And that ending was perfection!",dws9et
fbzg90n,"Yooo I was so sure that Jesper was going to take on the mantle and legend of Santa Claus, in honor of his old friend, all the way up to the very end. His ruddy nose made me positive, since that's what Santa is usually depicted with.

But I think I like the actual ending even better. Klaus becoming part legend adds the little touch of mystique and magic to a relatively grounded setting that I think really completes this as a Christmas movie. Also explains how Santa can actually give presents around the world.

Honestly, best animated movie of the year.",dws9et
fc0tdj6,"The structure and pacing of this film makes it wonderfully dense, the animation is gorgeus (the little blonde girl is dangerously cute), and I greatly appreciate the wealthy and cold father being written as a good person for a change.

10/10",dws9et
feiseau,"Oh god i cried twice. Once when Margu finally got to write a letter and get her present. And then the very end when Jesper says ""Once a year I get to see my friend again."" That hit hard. This may very well be tied for favorite christmas movie with Elf. Elf for humor and this for a more holiday spirit vibe.",dws9et
f7nncnn,"This is a fantastic movie. Pure magic. It's a shame more people don't give children's movies a go, because this one is just wonderful. The animation is beautiful and the concept is surprisingly void of cliches considering it's a Christmas movie. But I hope more people watch it because it's full of such thoughtful, tender moments and -- OH GOD I'M CRYING AGAIN.",dws9et

fc4qat8,"Wrote this comment as a reply to someone else, but wanted to put it here as well.

I’m a month late to the party, but I just watched the film tonight. I went in to the film not really knowing what to expect, and came away completely amazed at how much I enjoyed it.

Klaus captured that magic of the Disney Renaissance era in a way that I haven’t felt in years. Wikipedia mentioned that he had the goal of creating a 2D animated film in the way he envisioned the genre would have evolved if Disney hadn’t gone down their current path of 3D animation. I really hope to see more films like this in the future.",dws9et

fc7ds3i,"one thing i loved about this movie was that it wasn't overly christmasy at all. it felt like a regular movie that happened to do with christmas, which i think also really strengthened the plot. also i think that was a subtle way of teaching us that it doesn't have to be christmas to have the ""christmas spirit""",dws9et

This movie is GORGEOUS.",dws9et
fisso1h,"Goddamn this movie is bursting with so much energy and heart. So glad they chose to focus on the relationships and emotion of the characters when it could’ve been just the standard “main character grows and changes everyone’s lives, has their true intentions revealed before redeeming themselves to everyone who had felt betrayed” type of story. Instead they only really use it as a basic foundation of the story to push the narrative forward, which made this so much more enjoyable for me.",dws9et
f7yh8tx,"This movie has that genuine Christmas spirit in it. Its not re-inventing the wheel or anything, everything you kinda expect to happen will came around, but it doesnt keep the journey of the film to be so enjoyable and heartwarming. Amazing voice acting cast really brings a lot too.",dws9et
f839xls,The montage section where the post guy hands out letters was hilarious,dws9et

f866epi,"I’m not one that usually cries during films, especially Christmas films. But, there were 2 scenes that truly got me, spilling my precious tears onto the table below. The first scene was when Klaus gave the first gift to the boy trapped in the house. The animators and directory perfectly captured wonder, awe, and joy in just a few seconds of the film, but it truly was an amazing moment for me. The second, of course, was at the end when Klaus reunited with his wife. The line ‘I’m coming, Love.’ was so heart wrenchingly beautifully voice acted by Simmons, the graphics and animation were superb, the foley and sound effects, music, and editing all collaborated so nicely that I couldn’t help myself. It was a nice way to wrap up the story, with Jesper living with his new wife and children, them all hunkered down in the little town that once was up at arms with each other, but is now peaceful and united. And, of course, Jesper get’s to see his old friend once a year :)",dws9et
fbw5vfc,"Definitely late but I just watched this. 

Absolutely fantastic. Watching this will definitely be a tradition for me each year from now. The artwork is gorgeous, the music was spectacular, and it was super heartwarming.",dws9et
fbzzhx4,Just watched it today for Christmas and it's SO WHOLESOME AND LOVELY I LOVE IT,dws9et
fbzdgkm,"So good. I was holding back tears. 

I thought they were going to turn Jesper into Santa as he was getting that facial hair, I'm glad they kept the story as is though!

I also loved the fact that Jesper came up with all of the christmas lore on a whim, it really made it special. (Lump of coal, naughty list, going through the chimney).

Edit : this and Olive the other Reindeer are now my two favorite animated Christmas films ever!

Edit 2: Also did anyone else notice some minor parallels with Emperor's New Groove?  

Jester = Emperor Kuzco 

Poncho Dad (forgot his name) = Klaus 

Izma = The lady who ruled over the Krum family 

Just something I was thinking about :)",dws9et
f994sva,Does anyone else think there might also be a hidden message regarding the methodology of overthrowing a dictatorship?,dws9et
fcj3wcu,"I just watched this movie knowing nothing going in, and I'm so impressed. This was just so heartfelt and uplifting, I haven't felt this good leaving a movie in a long time. It needs some time to sink in, but it's very likely my new favorite Christmas movie. Not that there's much competition, I think most Christmas movies are pretty mediocre, but maybe that makes it more impressive that to me it was able to take a subject that I wouldn't initially care for that much and make it so great.",dws9et
fe9xs6s,"After their nomination and what I assume a hit film for Netflix, Netflix would be insane and a dick not to give SPA studios a three picture deal or somthing. Becuse I think SPA could become a Major player in animation by the end of the decade.",dws9et

So much that now i want a daughter like Margu..😍😍😍

But here is a question my sister keeps bugging me with ""How could Margu came at the post office and then return to her home (which is sooo far) by herself every  night?""

I think, She came & returned with her father, who probably had a job in town..may be??  

What do you think?  Can anybody explain?",dws9et

f7m4204,"It's been a while since I seen an animated film this beautiful and touching. Let alone any Christmas animated film this good in a while. I been following to this project since the teaser was made a few years ago. The lighting for this movie, especially during the foggy sections stuck out the most.  In fact, some of the visuals reminded me of the 1998 Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Movie mainly the Aurora Borealis/Northern Lights. 

If SPA Studios ever does a new Christmas movie in the future. Then they would be perfect to adapt the [original ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" story by Robert L. May from 1939](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/rudolph_book_cover_6.png) alongside Warner Brothers Animation (especially after Green Eggs And Ham). I would seriously love to see an adaptation that sticks closer to the [original story's art style](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/capture2_0.PNG) and [Rudolph original design between the 1939 till 1964](https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-23148795-jpg/blog/images/rudolph-resized-600.jpg). The only animated adaptation that's more faithful is the [Max Fleischer 1948 animated short.](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/894bd693_900a_4cb8_a5e6_85c4d090ec62.jpeg)",dws9et
f9dxbuj,"Just watched it for a second time. Cried for a second time. 

Pacing was great, never felt a dull moment. All the jokes landed. People are right in that Jesper feels like Kuzco and that isnt a bad thing. 

I know the movie says in the beginning that this is a Santa Claus origin, but I quickly forgot that. With all the build up for Klaus being Santa, it felt like a nice ""ah"" moment when you realize the traditions being built for Santa.

That being said, I cried when he vanishes. and cried even harder when Jasper is sitting around waiting for him.

Definable going to be a tradition to watch this movie",dws9et

KLAUS IS THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR, JESUS MY HEART IS FULL OF JOY, IM SO HAPPY, IM CRYING SO MUCH!!! I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SCENE, MY GOSH HOW I LOVE THIS MOVIE NOW!",dws9et
f9pg0mn,"Just watched it. Overall I really enjoyed it quite a bit. The animation is stunningly beautiful and I loved the style of the characters and the setting. The plot was a little by the numbers, but I didn't really mind that because it was a really clever take on the Santa Claus origin. At first I seemed to notice that the dialogue animations didn't seem to quite match the voice acting, but I think it smoothed out much more as the movie went on, or I just didn't notice it because I was so invested in everything else. 

I think the one thing keeping this from being a damn-near perfect animated movie for me was the use of music, specifically pop songs. I actually didn't mind the first instance where they used ""How you like me now?"" That song fit really well with that scene, I thought, almost like it's part of the joke and it gave me a good laugh. But the hip hop beat they use after he tells the little bully kid about the naughty list kind of made me groan. It wasn't horrible, but it sort of took me out of the movie for a moment. Kind of gave me ""Illumination's version of the Grinch"" vibes with the way they worked that music into the scene. But the thing that made me cringe despite everything else about the scene being awesome was whatever pop song they used when the little Sami girl gets her sled. If they want to use that song in the credits, fine, whatever. But it spoiled a moment that would have been much more effective had they used their original score instead. They didn't need the little pop star song to drive that moment home.

Other than those things, which are really minor gripes, I thought the movie was fantastic, and it makes me hope that we go back to more of the traditional 2D methods of animation and find new expressive and stylistic ways to carry the medium forward like they did with this movie.",dws9et
fc8x7pn,"You know I'm glad it's doing well, I found out about this film a year before it came out,and was hoping it wouldn't become forgotten. I hope this inspires Disney or Dreamworks to make another hand drawn film, even if it's for Disney Plus/ Peacock.

The humor and the characters are reminiscent of Pratchett, minus the biting social commentary. I mean when we first saw the postal academy I was immediately reminded of Going Postal and Mr Groats description of the post office in its glory days. Also the teacher had a similar surface character to Mrs Dearheart. I also loved the animation I wish there were more movies willing to do 2D again. The story just had heart and it felt genuine unlike many other Christmas movies like the Christmas Prince which felt like a cheap Hallmark movie.

10/10 from me, and one of the best Christmas movies I've seen. Has all the makings of a modern classic, and [r/netflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/) is gushing over it right now too.

and the art reminds me of iron giant, which is a huge bonus",dws9et
f7ypdvm,"I enjoyed it a lot. When I first saw the trailer I thought the postal guy would be a good, nice character that was looking out for children and wanted to make them happy. I enjoyed that they went a different route with that character. This is easily in the holiday movie lineup for me. Would rewatch every year.",dws9et
f87yqby,I kept browsing at the bottom of reddit to see if their are any bad reviews but so far i havent seen anything. So i watched it and bawl like a baby.,dws9et

f8sm6vk,"Trying not to see any spoilers. Just wanted to comment. Started watching it last night after seeing the fantastic shading technique being developed. It looks so amazing, like a rebirth of hand drawn animation. Smooth as 3D, but with all the appeal of the old fashioned 2D era.
Think I'm going to pause it and rewatch it with family over Christmas.",dws9et
f7mfoxe,- I really liked the story and seems like a great holiday movie for many generations to enjoy.,dws9et

f7n30lg,"I have to admit I originally put this on just to have something on in the background but after the first fifteen or so minutes it truly grabbed my attention and wouldn’t let go. 

It’s probably the best animated movie I’ve seen this year and it’s definitely the best christmas style movie I’ve watched this year. It blew Noelle out of the water and I loved that movie. 

I really loved what they did with the story of Santa. Will definitely be watching this again closer to Christmas.

Also that ending was just adorable.",dws9et
f7wruqy,"I really liked the movie! It may just be me, but it felt like the animators drew a lot of inspiration from the old school claymation Christmas movies. Even Mrs. Krum and Mr. Ellingboe resembled the Ice Miser and the Heat Miser.",dws9et
f7xhk2l,"Really good return to form for 2D feature.  Not the best christmas movie, not the best animated feature, but a good movie done traditionally.  

Choice of licensed music was absolutely an awful idea though.

f7zuvsi,"Very wholesome, beautifully animated.",dws9et

I think it's a delightful holiday film and a new instant classic.",dws9et

f7t2iq4,"This feels like an instant classic, I was immediately drawn in. The animation

f9f3erw,Better than Frozen 2.,dws9et
f7s7m52,"watched it  last night. Wow, a true delight coming from Netflix, which surprised me since I rarely found its movies better than ok at best. Absolutely gorgeous visuals, heartwarming and funny. A criticism may be made towards the plot which sounds a bit facile (a giant reclusive old bloke who makes beautiful toys ends up becoming Santa, that's as unsurprising as it gets) but then again it's a movie for all ages and about Christmas, so I can take the simplicity; it's got heart, funny characters, fantastic visuals and it will not rot away; I think it will become a staple of the genre",dws9et
f8nq43m,I just finished it. It conveys such deep human emotions in a very simple manner to be comprehended by children.,dws9et
f7lgi98,Amazing movie,dws9et
fbi2ulu,"I absolutely loved it, cried quite a few times and fell in love with the characters, art style and animation. One thing that stumps me is: how does the first kid to get a toy in Klaus know his name?",dws9et

f7y4sjp,"I wish the writing was stronger because the visuals blew me away, just incredible.

But as it is, it's just alright. I can understand why someone wouldn't like it or find it annoying. Most egregiously with the random pop songs just laid on certain scenes without any finesse or subtlety.",dws9et
f7ofed6,"Animation is a wonderful, every screen is work of art. 

Would like to see more movies use the hand-drawn style. 

Story is a nice take on the Santa Claus origin story.

Character designs reminded me of Journey to Atlantis.

Loved Norm MacDonald's roll.",dws9et
f7ovaew,"Really glad there's such a good reception to it here. The look of it was just so nice, and the characters were great. The captain inparticular had some great lines too",dws9et
f7p9qmf,This looked amazing in 4K HDR,dws9et
f7r2lma,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the trailers purely from the animation and J.K. Simmons playing Klaus and I am not going to lie. I absolutely loved this movie. Obviously the art style, 2d animation, lighting, etc.. all of that is gorgeous and one only has to watch the trailers to see that. I also loved the characters from the once charming selfish now changed Jesper, the broken and jaded Alva who reclaimed her love for teaching, the mysterious mourning Klaus who drives the message of the movie ""A true selfless act always sparks another."" What a simple but profound message for the movie and it shows. From the kids doing good deeds around town which in turn brings their parents to also do their own selfless acts. I always love the neighbors where the boy's father from the beginning of the movie tears down the broken fence to reveal the play house he built for his son and the neighbor's children to play in. You see him and the neighbor sit and watch their kids play together letting go of generations of family feuding that once drove them to fight one another. The movie is filled with so many moments that will bring tears to your eyes if not at least get them misty. 

The movie isn't perfect of course the cliche filled easy to see coming plot is easily the worst thing about the movie. Yet it never comes close to bringing down the gorgeous animation and art style or the wonderful main cast, the lovable side characters or the emotional heart of the movie. This movie has easily become one of my top 5 Christmas movies and it is definitely one I will watch every year.",dws9et
fb6jwi7,"I absolutely loved it!! I love movies like these, with the slightly different animation styles and subtle humor. Really a coming of age story for Jesper as well. 
I’m usually not a Christmas movie fan, but this was an exception. Also love Rashida Jones 
10/10 had me crying in the club :’)",dws9et
fc2akqo,An actual good Christmas movie not like those cash grab movie like the grinch or Santa girl and the reason I put Santa girl on there is because my teacher had us watch it.,dws9et
f7pbbou,"Dare I say, the artistic direction is the sole reason for Klaus being *that* good. 

The story itself is entirely predictable and filled with clichés, but it doesn't hinder the enjoyment at all when it's shown through the lenses of this stunning animation. The context of a traditional 2d art style, hand-drawn texturing and all, turns the well-worn tropes into something familiar and nostalgic. And may we please take a moment to notice how cleverly transitions are used for storytelling purposes? Everything about the art direction was so subtle, yet clearly deliberate, and  made me fall in love with the movie instantly.

Definitely will re-watch it before Christmas!",dws9et
f9j2zjd,"Just watched it. Really liked it for 2/3 of the movie. Last half hour was fine but I was kind of let down by the ending. Maybe it’s just me, but in the last couple minutes, it made it seem Jesper would become Santa, and as I thought about it, it would’ve made complete sense. 

Think about it, Jesper is our main character, right? And all throughout we get a sense that he’s more the traditional Santa than Klaus was. I mean, he even understood the other languages, I don’t think Klaus did, and if he did, they never showed it to my knowledge. Also, while Klaus definitely is the guy in charge, Jesper is really the one doing all the work (he himself is going in the chimney dropping off toys, putting Cole in stockings, he decided who’s naughty or nice, etc).

Also, Jesper falls in love with Alva, while Klaus’ wife is dead. And at the very end, when Klaus decides its time and goes to be with his wife, I thought that they were setting it up for Jesper to take on the mantle of “Santa Claus”, and the Claus would be a homage to Klaus or something. 

If they did this, then all of a sudden, we have the classic Santa. The elves, the reindeer, the North Pole, Mrs. Claus, etc. 

Towards the end when Klaus was going towards the light I was kind of mind blown thinking that they just completely did a 180, and Santa was actually Jesper, and I thought it was brilliant, then obviously we all know that’s not the route they took.

I don’t know, that definitely would have made the movie feel more complete for me",dws9et
fc2i8st,Loved it! The movie made me teary - eyed,dws9et

f7r0oat,Wow I really really liked this movie,dws9et
f7whiej,"I just watched Klaus and absolutely loved it. As an animator, I'm super impressed. It's so beautiful and the draughtsmanship and artistry on display is second to none! Helps that its lovely as a film as well. Big smile on my face after watching it.",dws9et
f7xiay1,"It was so charming and I totally had to hold back tears at the end. I really hope this inspires more 2D animation, it was so visually refreshing to watch.",dws9et
f8enaqu,Amazing film. The arts were incredible!,dws9et
f8isymc,Saw the movie last night. I found it truly mesmerizing. Great and fun movie!,dws9et
fbxulgy,Saw it last night and loved it. Jesper reminded me of Guybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island games.,dws9et
f7rbf0n,"Wow, I am surprised Netflix had a great film especially an animated one after consistently making subpar films. Bold risk for a first time director/writer from an unknown studio. The crazy thing is, this might be Netflix’s winner for an award since it outshined a lot of the other animated films this year.

After watching this, I was like this warranted a theatrical release but maybe releasing it on Netflix was a good choice since it has a potential to reach more people and children than a theatrical release.",dws9et
f860rrn,"This movie didn't feel particularly Christmassy - which I appreciated wildly.
I'm a proud Jew, and the constant barrage of Christmas for nearly a quarter of the year weighs an annoying and frustrating toll.
But this film, beautifully animated, was so full of heart, and kindness, and change, was magical start to finish, even if Santa wasn't.

I caught myself crying towards the end, really an incredible film.",dws9et
f7lm35y,I loved it. It's funny and the animation is gorgeous.,dws9et
f7lndz3,"I've been waiting for this since I saw the teaser on YouTube. I'm sad I couldn't see it in theaters (wasn't showing anywhere near here) but I'm so glad it got released at all. God, this is everything I ever wanted.",dws9et
f7nhj7g,"An absolutely wonderful movie. Anyone who’s considering it, I highly recommend it",dws9et
f9cw2j0,"This movie looks like I remember Monkey Island 3. Oddly specific and unrelatable statement perhaps, but let me offer a brief explanation. Monkey Island 3 does not look so impressive by todays standards, but when it was first released it was almost unheard of. It was animated with love and care and high enough definition to just flow into your mind like a cartoon, unlike games with rougher graphics where your mind kind of had to fill in the blanks to some degree (I of course realize that my mind retroactively has filled in blanks along with my expectations getting higher but that's beside the point). I was stunned and I loved it and it has forever a special place in my heart...

And Klaus just reached that place without any coaxing or anything. It just sailed right in there. 15 minutes in I was feeling meh about the story, but I could not stop watching because I loved the visuals too much. I enjoyed the story as well in the end, but god dang, I could have watched this entire move without sound and scenes out of order and still enjoyed it as much because it's just pure eye candy to me...",dws9et
fbi9sl4,Translator came in clutch. Straight up. Now the movie seems more complete.,dws9et

f7otv85,"What a pleasant surprise. 

I was interested because of the gorgeous animation style and good reviews, and I gotta say it ended up being phenomenal all around. This is easily top tier when it comes to Christmas movies and has the making of a classic holiday movie. I know that sounds bombastic, but man, this was such a joy.",dws9et
f7p4h5c,Such a gorgeous film. So many amazing aspects. One of my top 5 Christmas movies for sure. Worth the watch for sure. I hope Netflix continues with content like this,dws9et

f7n6xke,"Just watched this and sobbed like a baby at the end. Such a beautiful movie, from the animation to the story to the voice acting. My only complaint would be some of the music choices but those were easily overlooked. My favorite Santa “origin” story and something I’ll watch lots around Christmas time for years.",dws9et
f7n882f,a darker cartoon like over the garden wall would be cool in this animation style,dws9et
f85ekm0,The ending left me wondering how the Klaus kept bringing the presents and how did he get the letters from the kids.,dws9et
f7mvs5k,"Oh my god the animation looks amazing. If the actual movie is half as good as the animation looks, I can’t wait to watch this for Christmas.",dws9et
f7n0ub0,This is one of the best christmas movies I have ever watched it was just so wholesome.,dws9et
f7p3z06,"Decent movie.
I really enjoyed the first half but I felt like halfpoint onwards things got a bit rushed, the towns ""aggression"" was resolved a lot quicker than I expected and they didn't build up Jesper's relationship with Alva more. Animation was great and is an interesting interpretation of Christmas.
7/10 for me.",dws9et
hqktwh5,"I hate Christmas. Like from the bottom of my heart. Hard to explain why, it took me years to hate it this bad. But... This film was brilliant. I never really cry (not just while watching films, even when I'm sad I just can't cry. I used to be a crybaby but when my mother passed I stopped crying for some reason) but this film made me tear up a few times. Damn. 9.5/10",dws9et
f7ljy9t,I thought the film was gorgeous. But something wasn’t quite there for me in the story. I can’t put my finger on it,dws9et
fbyrqyn,"I think we can all agree that the animation was great and I do love this movie. Instant Christmas Classic. But I do feel they should have done 2 things differently. They should of had the mob destroy the toys and still have all the kids and adults happy the next day to drive home the ""One Good Deed"" message. And this should have been a silent movie. If there weren't any pop songs or any talking, this would have been better. But, as is, it's still great. The passing of Klaus into legend and the final, ""I get to see my friend"" line were amazing.",dws9et

faxmomp,Just watched the movie and this nailed it. The Krum lady reminded me of Yzma too!,dws9et
f7wikf0,"I thought he became the Christmas spirit like how there are Force Ghost in Star Wars, lol. But imagine if they actually showed Jesper discovered his body, that would be a truly heartbreaking scene.",dws9et
f7yfir2,"The film seems geared towards kids/families so I imagine the first one is the intended ending, but the second could be still be acknowledged.",dws9et
f8al9rn,"I think it’s actually almost explicitly explained to be the former. Jesper makes the comment after Klaus disappears, “what happened to him after that I can’t even begin to understand,” or something along those lines. Then he says he gets to see his friend once a year, while sitting with cookies and two glasses of milk next to an empty chair.",dws9et
f9lkfj5,"I love that it’s ambiguous.  Kids can watch and interpret it the first way, adults who want to interpret it as a more “realistic” tale can look at it the second way.  Truly destined to be a Christmas classic.",dws9et
fa9j50f,"> Either Klaus somehow became the magical immortal Santa Claus that visits once a year.

It's most definitely this one.",dws9et
f9yy832,"""we get to see him once a year"" means we get to see the spirit of christmas. The spirit of giving. That a simple act of kindness sparks another. Hence you recieve and give gift during christmas. Klaus died but his spirit lives on. We all became klaus.",dws9et
f7ytm5p,"Same. The trailer popped up and I was just like “imma give it a try”.

fc4pudo,"I’m a month late to the party, but I just watched the film tonight. Wanted to say you perfectly described my thoughts on this. Klaus captured that magic of the Disney Renaissance era in a way that I haven’t felt in years.

f7navps,"Definitely feel the same way. My girlfriend loves to watch the same movies every Christmas, I rarely care to see something more than once. This was however phenomenal, we both loved it and could absolutely watch it again next month.

As a personal recommendation, if you haven't seen it, Rise of the Guardians is both of our absolute favorite 'holiday' movie (although Klaus is a contender to replace it). It's not centered around Christmas, but it does have Santa, Jack Frost, etc. and has the feel to it.",dws9et

f7m4tz2,"The lighting is so beautiful, especially with the lantern one kid is seeing holding in his hand.",dws9et
f85uttm,If you get a chance to look up how they did the lighting it’s really interesting! I went to a panel at an animation expo in September and they talked about the process. The characters and animation were hand drawn but also had 3D meshes created for them that the lighting was rendered based off of. But even that didn’t quite look right so they created an entire new tool set to allow artists to change the shape of the light and the way it interacted with the characters. Seriously awesome stuff and it looks amazing.,dws9et

f9jsyhp,"I actually liked the pop songs, but I'm really glad to see someone else mad at the 6000 blowing up in Jesper face. I can't shut up about how I didn't like how it went down. Of course they had to learn about the letters at some point, but damn, except for the Sami none of them were virtuous in this, they either had something to get out of it or didn't do zip, they so don't have a leg to stand on for being mad. 

A friend pointed out that they were just sad because he was leaving, and I can get it, but I feel like there was a better, more natural, more personal and less cliché way to handle it (i have the ending of in the Heights in mind, ""[I wish I was mad, I'm just too late](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo5Uu6ZSnnw&list=PLn0Zn1caShZWlW5JwG0ULhWjEa2hFN6m6&index=21)"". Not saying everyone should have reacted this way, but at least it's different and feels unique). Jesper's father telling him to stay was great, I was not expecting it to go down so easily and supportively, that was truly refreshing. I really wish everyone learning about the 6000 letters was as refreshing. Maybe with a little bit more time they could have done something more ""at heart"" with it, instead of slapping a cliché reaction on everyone. Heck, maybe they could have actually resolved the situation with the clans too, right now the town leaders still want war.",dws9et
f98o0xf,Definitely feel the same way with you. I thought the How You Like Me Now was jarring at first but kinda silly and accepted it later on. But the emotional pop song really took me out of it ina cringe kind of way. That moment seemed like a misstep in an otherwise great film,dws9et
f7qzzv7,"Sadly it is one of the most tired cliches in all of movies the liar/ulterior motive reveal. The unlikable selfish protagonist who originally lied or had an ulterior motive at the beginning of the movie has it revealed to their friends/townspeople. Mostly everyone turns on them even though they have changed and they ""leave"" until psyche they haven't and they return to save/help save the day from the villain. Easily one of the few complaints I have about the film my other gripe actually stems from this cliche. When Jesper and his father are leaving on the ship and his father sits across from him. It looks like they are about to have a heartfelt father/son talk. It cuts before they talk to Margu thinking he left until, fake out, he didn't leave. Then he goes on to tell her second hand about his talk with his dad and how he was proud of Jesper for all he has done. They ruined what probably would have been a great heartfelt scene for a joke and it made me sad.",dws9et

The whole movie was particularly ""not"" magical. Every part of the Christmas mythos is explained in a rational way. Flying reindeers are just a crashing sleigh, elves are just sami people, the naughty list is there because Jesper was angry at the kid, etc. It's very ""Christmas for adults who >!know santa doesn't exist!<"". But then you get some magic mystery back at the end, the same kind of magic mystery the kids felt when they couldn't explain how Klaus made it through their chimney. I actually didn't see the ending with magical inexplicable ghost Klaus coming, whereas a ""and then Jasper became Klaus and then it was some other random person etc."" was obvious as soon as Klaus started aging. And there's no magic in that.

Additionally, Jesper big choice is about settling for a normal life, quote ""never hoping for anything more?"", instead of choosing the ""bright future"" his father proposed him. I think Jesper becoming a famous figure every child of the world writes to would have defeated that choice. He settled for a normal life, let him have that normal life.",dws9et

The dialogue was really mediocre as well I think, very dull except for the odd line. Very forgettable scenes and sequences except maybe the chase at the end.. seriously think of memorable scenes in The Jungle Book or Beauty and the Beast. Now think of scenes from Klaus.

It has so much heart and I love any movie that's smartly written enough to not really having an antagonist. They nail down the family dynamic and what it feels like to get together with people you don't really have anything in common with but you have to because they're family.

The issue is that you have to go out of your to find anything else.

And I think I'd be happier if this WAS religious, but because Christmas isn't religious, the concepts explored in the film (Christmas spirit, kindness) don't really seem to exist in corporate Christmas

Of course it is not okay, and while I do not think that the movie was trying to make a comment about racism regarding the sami people there have been (and to a degree still are) racism and tensions between the Sami and the Scandinavians.

However this is a still picture, to create such a fidelity in 2d animation in a commercially viable way is a whole other game.

Namely the shading and lighting with such smooth motion is extremely difficult and time consuming work, the newly developed techniques is what made it possible within a doable time frame, that is what makes the film such a technical achievement, and why it has not been done before on such a scale with 2d animation.

Sorry for dragging this on but it's an interesting conversation for me that I don't get to have often.

I understand your viewpoint and I agree that the movie doesn't really have anything to do with Christmas.

It must suck being stuck in elf land when you don't want to.

I said what I said before for 2 reasons. 
Firstly the idea of 'claiming something' cultural ( and this is what this is - Cultutal ) or 'being proud' is something I only hear from Americans. The rest of us ( excluding the anglophones lately that tend to follow you step by step ) just participate in something or don't. There's nothing to claim or be proud of.

Secondly it's just that, for me at least, there's absolutely nothing Cristian about Christmas season.

Santa. No. Elves. No. Presents. Big maybe. Trees. Nope. Turkeys. Nope. Music. Nope

It's a big mix n match of Germanic & Scandinavian traditions & $$$

It's about as Christian as Halloween is European and we started 'celebrating' that a couple of years ago.

Think of it as football season. Go for the cookout and skip the game",dws9et

fbtislr,"To clarify, I love his voice. Just not on that face.",dws9et
f7n5ugr,"Yeah, same here. I can understand the others being upset, but regardless of what his initial motivations were, it doesn’t change the fact that he’s the one who started all of this and has still caused a lot of good. Kicking him out straight away before even giving him a chance to explain just seems a bit overly harsh. And even when Jesper does come back and risk his skin to save (what he thinks are) the presents, Klaus doesn’t seem to even appreciate that until he almost slides off a cliffside. 

I think I would’ve been quicker to forgive all this if not for the reveal after the climax that they already had everything under control, and that Jesper nearly screwed it up. Sure, he’s still able to prove his sincerity, but it also serves to further humiliate him for no real reason. I kinda wish the writers had at least given him that. 

I understand the narrative purpose for wanting Jesper to demonstrate that his goals truly have changed, so I wouldn’t remove it entirely. I’d probably just tone down the anger a bit and maybe have Jesper return to Klaus’ workshop a bit sooner, so he could be in on the switcheroo plan (but still save it as a surprise for the audience until afterward).",dws9et

f7u6na9,"Yeah, a half second shot.  The way the shot is presented, everything but the center has RGB shift, and the shot before and after has our attention towards the center. The rgb shift is literally (and most of the time) in our periphary.


I personally love the rgb shift, but I know people who dislike it. I read the reason the creators decided to do that was because comic books, or at least older comic books don’t have blur and bloom effects. I think not having motion blur and depth of field in a comic book movie paying homage to comic books is nice artistic choice, and a visually interesting one too. But art is subjective 🤷‍♂️",dws9et

i6k47hy,"Well, not really, she didn't ever lie about her intentions to leave the village at any point in the beginning. However, she was only asked to teach the kids how to read and write, which she did and went above and beyond that. Jesper on the other hand had hidden his true intents and had used everyone's kind nature and intentions to further his goal of abandoning them. Which he had never once mentioned to anybody throughout the  several weeks and months that they'd gotten to know each other. This is even worse for Klaus since he'd opened up to him about his dead wife and his griefs, which was super hard for him only for Jesper to have been revealed to have pushed Klaus out of his pain just so that he could leave. I think that was the intent. Either way that 3rd act break up didn't last too long at all, the movie needed to cement it in as a final test for Jesper's conviction to stay, but it would be really generic to drag it out. So, to me at least, it wasn't really that annoying or unnecessary.",dws9et

f7y8oli,"Nice backtrack from ""it's disorienting"" to ""it's orienting."" And the RGB split is everywhere on the image, even Spiderman's head. A half second is plenty of time to absorb an image, lots of action shots are only half a second. It's so strong it overwhelms the viewer instantly, it's why it stuck out to me like a sore thumb. It would have been a striking image but it's ruined by pink and turquoise graffiti. 

If the creators wanted to imitate comic's deep depth of field then they should have... used a deep depth of field. Instead, they went the opposite direction and not only tried to have a shallow depth of field but replaced blur with a hideous RGB split or double vision that has the *opposite* effect of blur. It's used in almost every frame and it makes the viewer feel like they're going crossed eyed so they're constantly looking at the background trying to make sense of it instead of the subject. I'm not aware of double vision/RGB split ever being used as a replacement for blur. The only case I know of is in the Expanse where for some reason everyone's computer screens are broken and have RGB split to make them look more *futuristic*. 

They failed to even create a comic book look. To me it looks like good 3D animation but with cheap filters puked all over it--because that's what it is.",dws9et
hoqte3e,At the end when she sticks it in the snowman the correct non-stabby direction 😭,dws9et
f7zf5x7,"You still misunderstand, I did not switch from disoreinting to orienting, what I was trying to say was that the intention of rgb shift was to draw your focus to specific areas, the same way DoF does. And that’s literally the creator’s intentions.

Check it out: [link](https://deadline.com/2018/12/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-phil-lord-christopher-miller-sony-interview-1202517039/) 

“We used chromatic aberration, which is like when they would misprint a comic book page, and the colors would separate. We would use that for things in the background that you weren’t supposed to look at, and then a thing you were supposed to look at was crisp and in focus, as a different stylistic way to show depth of field”

Typically comic books, or most of the ones I read don’t have depth of field, so there’s really not much to emulate.",dws9et
f81u36d,"Yes you did. You first claimed it was part of the disorientation of the camera shaking and laser shooting. Then when I proved that was total BS you switched to ""it orients the viewer to a specific area."" Which is what **I'VE** been explaining they *tried* to use if for (but they failed miserably). Something's wrong with your reading comprehension if you're posting a link about the very thing I already criticized. So re-read my comment if you want to know why it's a terrible idea to use RGP split as ""a different stylistic way to show depth of field.""

I'll add that they're totally inconsistent with it and switch between RGB split and double/triple vision seemingly at random. Both are terrible and switching makes it worse. Like I said before, it draws your focus *away* from the area it's supposed to. Blur works because it removes detail and information on the places you're not supposed to look. RGB split and triple vision *adds* a ton of information that drowns out the subject and fills the frame with junk. So with every scene your brain has to play a cross-eyed game of Where's Waldo?

And in the shot I posted, the more I look at it the worse it gets. Everything, even Spiderman has an RGB split so I don't even know what they were trying to do there. The direction of the split and the orientation of the colors are all over the place, so it imitates neither a misprint or a lens. It's just really... bad.",dws9et
