e0bwb1y,"Virtually the entire movie was a r/MovieDetails landmine. Major spoilers ahead, with various degrees of obviousness vs. subtlety, but all details that I've noticed other Redditors questioning:

-  Ellen's supposedly schizophrenic husband died of starvation, and her son killed himself after claiming that his mother was trying to ""put people inside him."" In this way, the plot starts very much before the movie does, and Ellen and the cult have been working steadily before Annie's family enters the picture.

- On this ""plot starts before the movie does"" note, Annie did not allow Ellen much time or contact with Peter when he was born. The mother and daughter relationship was, as Annie describes in the grief counseling, ""not talking, then talking, then not talking"" (light paraphrasing here).

- Following this, Ellen was apparently allowed to have a very close relationship with Charlie, who was ""her favorite.""

- One figurine scene throughout the movie shows Ellen watching in on Annie and her husband having sex / sleeping together. This might be a reference to the next point:

- Annie tried to have a miscarriage with Peter, but it didn't work, consistently. Her mother insisted that she have the child, which she must have wanted as a vessel for Paimon.

Flash Forward to the Present:

- Ellen's funeral is full of strangers, who were the cult members. One of them, the smiling blonde man, is seen later in the house during the final 30 minutes of the movie.

- Charlie foreshadows the decapitation ritual with the pigeon head.

- The telephone pole that decapitated Charlie had the cult insignia on it.

Edit 2:

- Back to the party, the teenagers in one room watched a decapitation video, foreshadowing what was going to happen to Charlie.

- A note on the accident. The biggest criticism I've seen of the plot is that the cultists couldn't have predicted that the accident. Two things on this: (A) Paimon is the demon prince of wisdom and foresight, who can gift all knowledge, secrets  and mystery. So yes, they probably could have known. (B) The cultists aren't blueprinting this entire scenario. They're preparing it. The cult insignia on the telephone pole is all the evidence that they were involved.

- When Annie goes to Joanie's house and we see the inside of Joanie's apartment, there are multiple strange toys / dolls similar to the ones Charlie used to make. Very weird. I don't want to read too far into this, but I seriously question if Charlie was ever a child or if it was always Paimon

- Both Joanie and Ellen have black triangles in their rooms. Joanie's has a picture of Peter in it, leading me to believe that Ellen could have been using hers against the family (from inside the house) prior to the start of the film.

Edit 3:

- The kneeling pose Annie is in upon witnessing Charlie's death is the same one she kneels in at the end of the film, in the tree house.

- Charlie notes that Ellen wanted her to be a boy  and Annie tells her how Ellen would insist on being the one to feed her. Ellen, then, was nursing Charlie to be a vessel for Paimon.

MAJOR EDIT:

I'm convinced that Charlie was always inhabited /possessed by Paimon, and that the only time we ever saw the ""real"" Charlie was when she possessed Annie. Hear me out:

- Charlie was Ellen's ""favorite,"" and was in regular contact with her as a baby.

- Charlie asks Annie who will take care of her after she (Annie) dies. I believe this is a nod to Paimon inhabiting Charlie in the present day.

- We hear from the final few lines of the movie that Charlie was the original, intended host, but that she was not sufficient.

- ""Charlie"" makes the same kinds of demented toys and figurines that the cultist Joanie has on her kitchen table.

- ""Charlie"" cuts off the head of the pigeon. Later, it is shown that ""Charlie"" has drawn a picture of the pigeon head wearing a crown  (a nod to Paimon, Prince of Hell).

- This crowned pigeon head drawing is a dark foreshadowing to the final idol we see in the treehouse, which is the crowned, decapitated and rotten head of Charlie herself.

- Charlie's voice, tone, and attitude are very different before her death vs. when she possesses Annie. There is a very noticable franticness and helplessness, as she cries out in confusion.

e0beb9r,"Quick explanation of the how I saw the events of the film connecting together (friends of mine were confused, so maybe this will help anyone in a similar situation):

The grandma was the leader and founder of the cult, and they needed a host for Paimon. Originally, the grandmother wanted to place Paimon into her own son, Annie’s brother, but he killed himself before Paimon was able to take control, so the grandmother’s next plan was to place Paimon within Annie’s son, but Peter was kept away from her as a child, so she had to place Paimon within Charlie. 

Paimon was always within Charlie, but couldn’t take full control of a female host, that’s why grandma wanted Charlie to be a boy. Peter was the intended host but was kept away from the grandmother, so she was unable to “give” Paimon to him (likely done through the breast milk of the grandmother, which is why she insisted on feeding Charlie). Paimon/the cult then hatched the plan to have Peter inadvertently kill Charlie, which released Paimon while simultaneously bringing Peter to his most vulnerable state, which was one of the conditions needed for Paimon to possess him. Paimon was embodied by the blue light which traveled from Charlie, to the notebook, to Annie, and ultimately to Peter, who then became Paimon after jumping out of the window. ",8pg2ma

EG:

-The randomly edited shot of viciously chopping walnuts right before they get to the party that only gains significance 10 minutes later

-Annie casually mentioning at her first Grief support group meeting that her brother hung himself at 16 because **he thought his mother was trying to put people inside of his body**

The drama and execution of the horror was brilliant. The constant dread paying off to the last 30 minutes was handled like a master of the craft.

That last segment in the house has some of the most terrifying horror imagery I've ever seen.



The shot of Annie behind Peter on the ceiling when he wakes up froze me and had me nearly pissing myself, as well as the shot of the naked figure he sees at the doorway. 

The use of framing and lighting in this film was pitch perfect.

The ending is a little conventional for the style of horror, but wow was it just unnerving.

Also, no one in the theater mentioned the people surrounding the house after  Steve was burned alive during the day to night shift of the property.

e0ba8ka,Annie mentions that her brother killed himself after he blamed his mom for putting people in his body. Was he the initial choice for the host?,8pg2ma
e0b89ns,"Spoiler question: so in the grief counseling scene, Anne describes that she wasn’t speaking to her mother when Peter was born and let her back into her life when Charlie was born. She said that she immediately sank her hooks in and wouldn’t even let Anne feed Charlie. Now later when she “scared herself” in the workshop and turned around the diorama was that her mother feeding Charlie while Anne protested? 

To me it looked like an older woman breastfeeding while the younger woman still had her breast out. That would make sense why Charlie was so different right?

I don’t think there was a wasted shot or line, incredible movie. ",8pg2ma
e0ep2ou,"Another thing I’d like to mention; did anybody else feel like all the establishing wide shots of the house & the woods looked a WHOLE lot like the miniature set-pieces? And the fact that every transition from day to night or night to Day was instant, almost like a switch being flipped? It felt like the whole thing could have taken place in Annie’s workshop.

e0be2sj,"This movie intensely, intensely disturbed me. I consume a lot of dark media, and some of the things in this film will stay with me for a long time. This is going to be a classic. 

My favorite parts: 

1. The foreshadowing at the funeral with the people. Annie mentioning how she doesn’t recognize them and that her mother had private interests. 

2. Annie seeing her mother’s apparition after discovering her cult books. 

3. Annie’s discussion of the mental illness in her family, specifically her mentioning that her brother thought her mother was “putting people inside him.” I thought this was very good characterization and spoke volumes about the trauma Annie had been put through. 

4. The post and the entire sequence where Charlie died. I felt SO uncomfortable and worked myself up. I had to tell myself it was fiction, just a movie. The sight of her decapitated head on the side of the road coupled with her mother’s screams absolutely gutted me, and I don’t think I’ll forget it. 

5. The entire sequence in the treehouse. Just absolutely so grim and creepy. Leaves you feeling like you’ve jolted awake from a nightmare. 

I really think this movie had great moments. The final act was mind-bending for me, but I plan on seeing it again and trying to make better sense of it. I almost wish they’d kept it more mental health oriented, because the hallucinations your own mind can conjure are endlessly terrifying without the whole cult member sequence. But I understand why they did that, and I do enjoy the ending. 

Toni’s performance is standout. The whole monologue in the kitchen when her eyes get wilder and wilder and the pitch of her voice really scared me. Honestly, all of the performances in this are earnest and affecting.

e0mtnk4,"My theory: Paimon can only transfer hosts through decapitation and carries the souls of those he has captured with him.

Grandma, the host of Paimon, dies. Cult digs up the grave and decapitates her, freeing Paimon. 
Paimon occupies the body of a pidgeon which seeks out Charlie. Charlie had been groomed and breastfed by grandma and was the next obvious host for Paimon. Charlie decapitates the bird. Paimon then occupies the body of Charlie. 

The cult members want a male host and scheme to transfer Paimon into Peter's body. They put their mark on the telephone pole where Charlie is then decapitated. Traumatized, Peter keeps driving and does not look once at the backseat. The first person to find Charlie is Annie, who is then possessed by Paimon in her moment of vulnerability as she cries for her daughter. Annie screams that she must kill herself, the pain is unbearable. Annie always had an intuitive compulsion to kill her children, as she subconsciously wanted to destroy potential hosts for Paimon. With Paimon inside her, she feels compelled to destroy herself.

Annie meets Joan who coordinates the transferral of Paimon from Annie to Peter. Annie is able to conjur the spirit of Charlie because Paimon carries the souls of those he has captured. Unbeknownst to the fam, Annie carries more souls than just Charlie's. Paimon begins taking increasing control of the increasingly vulnerable Annie.

In the attic, Annie cuts off her head, freeing Paimon's spirit and the souls of those he has captured. Paimon follows Peter out the window, finally arriving into the male form he desired. Carrying the spirit of Charlie, Paimon, and the other past hosts, Peter makes the same clicking sound as his sister.

TLDR; Each time we see a decapitation, the spirit of Paimon is transferred to the next most vulnerable host, carrying with him the captured souls of the previous hosts.

The scene where Charlie died was so fucking good. The way Peter just sat there not wanting to look back. Because he knew looking back would make it real.

e6xy500,"To the viewers who didn’t like the supernatural turn, the ending could be interpreted as non-supernatural imo. Joan and the cult believe that Paimon was successfully transferred to Peter. But like real life cults, what they believe isn’t necessarily true-just because they believe that Paimon is a real entity, doesn’t mean Paimon actually exists. Its not only the mother and son who could be suffering from delusions. 
At the ending scene, Peter just stares dazedly around, there’s nothing explicit that confirms or denies that he isn’t Peter anymore, other than Joan’s words, and the ghostly lights-which for all we know, could all be in Peter’s mind, just like all the strange things he witnesses throughout the film.

Paimon could be taken as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which hits men harder and earlier. It says it right there in the film title; the family has a history of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, which is hereditary. Peter was at the age where the average onset occurs for men. That, combined with a traumatic trigger and all that pot jumpstarts his hallucinations. Of course, a supernatural interpretation is valid and makes sense as well but I think a non-supernatural interpretation is equally valid and believable.",8pg2ma

I have a few observations from watching it twice that I think all support this. 

1. When Charlie is at her grandmothers casket and looks to the right, there is a man who smiles at her. That same man is the one Peter sees in the doorway behind him after discovering his father’s burnt body. More people seen earlier in the film also appear naked at the house, which can be assumed to all be members of the cult that the grandmother led. 

2. I’m sure there are more scenes where this occurs but this is one I caught, but right before the paint falls over on Joan’s note in front of Annie, if you look behind her at the window you can see a flash of light just like the one that flies around throughout other parts of the film. This light being Paimon. 

3. This detail is pretty obvious, but Annie mentions her brother hanged himself after saying his mom “put people inside him”. This is because she was the head of the cult that tried to bring Paimon into the world with a male host. 

4. While it mentions that Paimon needs a male host, it also says Paimon can take control over the vulnerable. This is why it was able to be in Charlie but still needed to eventually take a male host. Also, right after the father burns to death, the light enters into the mother and her face goes blank. Obviously all the death she experienced makes her very vulnerable, and Paimon going into her is what allowed her to float and go through walls like she did. 

5. Another pretty obvious point, but still important was Joan’s ritual on her table in her house with the picture of peter. After we see that we see her expelling Peter and telling him to get out. This is because as a member of the cult she is trying to get Peter out to allow Paimon to take over. And when this happens he is temporarily taken over when he bashes his head against the desk. This helps show that it is both the cult itself and Paimon doing the work here. 

6. Finally, I think this is a bit more of a stretch but it makes complete sense, is that as a way of disrespecting the trinity, Paimon ensure that the Grandmother, Mother, and Daughter all end up without their heads in the end. Both the mother and Grandmother’s headless bodies are bent down worshipping Paimon in the end, and the head of Charlie is on the statue wearing the crown. The crown is then passed on to Peter who now is under the control of King Paimon. I don’t believe that them losing their heads was a necessary sacrifice, but a way of Paimon insulting the holy trinity. Because the trinity consists of the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost, while the three he killed are the mother, the daughter, and the grandmother (which led the cult to bring back Paimon so he may have potentially equated her to that). 

Anyways, I know most people probably won’t read this and it’s completely up to interpretation, but for me this is the explanation that makes the most sense for the events that conspired. I’ll be watching it again eventually to see if there’s anything else that supports this. Thanks for taking the time to read, and feel free to give your thoughts.

Edit: In the director's AMA today he stated the body of the grandmother was dug up and placed in the attic by members of the paimonist cult. ",8pg2ma
e0s1kiv,"Someone posted a link earlier to the screenplay and I just wanted to note they left out a lot of things that clearly showed Annie does indeed have DID.  Steve is actually a psychiatrist and gives her pills.  She frequently says that she’s “lucid” to try to convince him she’s not making things up.  The movie did a good job of leaving little hints that this was the case - the sleepwalking and loss of time, but also the sticky note reminders she leaves herself.  This is a realistic coping skill used with DID.  But most telling us a cut scene close to the end where Steve invites her doctor (psychiatrist and colleague) over to their house to speak with her.  He begins a basic assessment for DID at the end of the scene, asking her what day it is and then what month.  She’s familiar with the process.  

“Sleepwalking” was always another identity coming through, and probably one completely aware of what was happening and trying to save her kids.  The sleepwalking scene where she keeps covering her mouth is probably that identity coming through and another identity trying to stop her (covering the mouth).

This movie is DEFINITELY about both mental illness and possession.  I think Paimon stays with this family because by their very nature/heredity they are extremely vulnerable.  Boom.

And for that tension to finally be realized with Annie's scream while pulling into a closeup of Peter's eyes.

e0d3h9v,"I can tell this one is going to stick with me for quite a while. I just can't stop thinking about it. 

I will always enjoy seeing Toni Collette playing a burnt-out mother. 

The mom, dad, and son all portrayed deep-rooted anxiety *so* well. 

I absolutely loved the pacing and the slow-burn feel of it all. I have to say, though, there were maaaybe one or two parts where I felt myself thinking, ""OK....you can walk a little faster than that. This is overkill."" It was only a couple parts, but it really stuck out to me because I'm usually the person who is 100% onboard with that kind of pacing. 

Also, the movie did a really good job of dropping backstory on you *without* having some random character cheesily explain it toward the climax of the movie. Of course it came from a book, but still, I think they handled the explanation part well. 

Speaking of explanation, I think I get it. It didn't seem that convoluted, but I also think there were some key things that I missed. If anyone has a link to a good explanation thread, article, etc., I'm all ears.

I'm so pissed at the audience I saw it with, though. People were talking the *entire* time...and like, audibly. Not even whispering or trying to hide it. And before the credits even rolled, there's a ton of people doing the whole ""When is it gonna get scary?"" ""I want a refund"" bullshit...OUT LOUD...*DURING* THE MOVIE. 

And I'm so goddamn sick of smartwatches. People. Please. Every time you go to put popcorn or candy in your mouth, your smartwatch lights up like a christmas tree *right* in the face of teh person next to you. It's like a goddamn spotlight.

- Steve is alerted that Ellen's grave was desecrated, but tries ignoring it only for the body to show up in their own attic as part of the black magic ritual

- Peter fails to even acknowledge the fact that Charlie was killed.  He doesn't call 9-1-1, he doesn't even tell his parents until they discover the decapitated body the next morning.  He tries ignoring the event, but soon starts to breakdown, eventually becoming the host for the demon

e0b70j1,"Now the score to this movie. This is one fucked up and scary ass score. It's not even a pleasant listen in the slightest. It's like listening to a Joseph Bishara score, but the composer leans into a wider array of instrumentation. Divorced from its context, Bishara's scores are bizarre, filled with a lot of quiet bass reverb with occasional entrances of strings. Although this is a little different in that there is actually very little quiet spaces and takes advantage of those moments to fill with very effective uses of bass reverb or separate vocal tracks that get pitched down. It's not traditional in any sense, but there are some interesting new directions Colin Stetson goes in, especially this weird distorted electronic voice around 1:19 in Funeral that is the most otherworldly shit I've heard all year. I wish he used it more, cause it was a heck of an effect. 

Also Stetson keeps the base of a string ensemble here, but the real star is these electronic manipulations he uses for what sounds liked a manipulated bowed bass or augmented bassoon. It's a little bit Charles Bernstein, like a drop, but I think this even takes inspiration from Ernst Toch. There's some really wonderful sections of woodwind here that you don't get to hear a lot outside of classical music, and here you get this really propulsive clarinet ostinato in ""Party, Crash"" that just ramps up an incredible amount of tension. 

I will give Colin Stetson this. Horror scores did need a kick in the ass and this is one hell of a way to approach them. When it comes to scores in the horror genre I like Christopher Young the most, but this was different enough and bizarre enough that it kept my attention for far longer than I thought it would. It even has elements of tape recording in small sections of the score.

Just about the only motif is the arppagiated clarinet symbolizing the supernatural that gets bass boosted in Seanace Sleepwalking. I think my only problem with it is that Stetson uses the same technique to finish every cue. It's a sudden drop cut that probably signifies a jump scare or what not that he uses  about five times in the space of four cues. It's a bit annoying. I also think it could have used a theme or some kind of motif. There's an idea of one in Mothers & Daughters, but it doesn't amount to much. It's a score that runs on pure feeling of terror by knocking you off your guard with some inventive sounds, like Saxophone bleats and sections  that are Stetson's own vocal performances on Get Out, and even bits of droning electronics mixed with Harmonica, which is probably effective in the film, but here the overall story doesn't come through. However, Stetson's lack of experience in film scoring allows him to eschew some of the more annoying traits of horror scoring and he's able to just fill these empty spaces with sound, and switching and augmenting and distorting. There's always something new in your ears, which I think is the key to why it works so well. Although the lack of any thematic ideas does not take away from his achievement here. The score, even toward the final back half, is downright evil. There is a sort of resolution of all the main ideas in the score in Reborn, which is sort of an interesting cue where all the distorted vocal and saxophone performances become triumphant, although something tells me this is one fucked up scene.",8pg2ma

e0qld7h,"Well I got to see it a second time today, in an almost empty theater, and I really tried to focus on the details as much as possible.  Here are a few things I noticed. 

First and I think the biggest thing I noticed was there is a doll/figure on the shelf right next to Charlie’s bed that looks like the final scene doll/figure.  It looks much more sophisticated than the ones Charlie is putting together herself, but yet fits in with her bedroom enough it does t really stand out at first.  There are many opportunities to see this throughout the film.  

Next to that figure on the shelf is a much bigger, darker figure.  I really wasn’t focused on it so much, but it was there and I think significant. Perhaps Paimon in his true form.  

Then, when Annie spills the bottle of blue paint that leads her to Joan’s number, her hand never touches the bottle.  She is reaching for a different bottle and it just falls over.  Definitely Paimon trying to move her towards Joan.  

When Steve tries to close the window during the Home-seance, she stops him and says desperately, “We can’t change anything!”   Double entendre much?

On the last day, Annie is wearing pajama pants and rain boots.  I really think this has something to do with the sleepwalking thing, though it could just indicate how unraveled she’s becoming.  Costume choice is pretty specific though.  

Finally, it just struck me as really wildly uncomfortable the way Joan keeps grabbing Annie in the art store parking lot.  She’s desperate in an increasing way that makes you wonder if all of this is time sensitive.  Like Charlie/Paimon have to transition quickly.  

I heard it the first time, but only on doing a little research connected the fanfare trumpet music at the end with Paimon.  It’s part of his description.

I do think the ending was similar to The Witch, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The ending works here, and I thought it was done pretty well, if a bit abrupt. Cast did a great job in all their roles as well, nothing but praise.

e26avyf,"I just watched this film, and it is subtle, but after Peter jumps out of the attic window, the camera from above lowers over Peter’s body. If you look carefully, you will see a shadow slide FROM his body before the ethereal light hovers over. 

This is not a shadow cast from the mother’s headless body floating to the tree house. I am sure that is Peter’s spirit being forced out of its body so the possession can take place. After all, the cult is setting events in motion to weaken Peter. Being scared shitless and jumping out a window to end up dying is a very weak and vulnerable state even though it was not a premeditated suicide like Ellen’s son’s death was. 

I am pretty sure that at some point prior to the film’s events starting, Ellen successfully forced Charlie’s spirit out of the body. Later during Annie’s seance somehow Annie was successfully possessed by the real Charlie due to the noticeable change in voice character and a surge of emotional energy not present in the “pre collision” Charlie. The real Charlie has been displaced and the seance happened to call to her successfully. If I am correct, Paimon is also known for causing “mischief”, so in a very demonic sense of humor it may have allowed this possession to happen for fun?


Again, that shadow was deep and smoky, not a light shadow that could be cast from the mother’s body floating away toward the treehouse. ",8pg2ma
e71lx99,"I wish there was more internal consistency to the demon. His presence is the MacGuffin that drives the plot whenever it needs it, but then he’s oddly powerless when the characters need to develop. For example, he possesses the mom when asleep in order to foster distrust amongst the family years prior, but as long as we see Charlie alive he does next to nothing. The mother’s life appears tethered to Charlie’s scrapbook (through the plot ritual that also remains completely unexplained - Paimon was already haunting them but I guess the ritual strengthened him or something because after that he was conventionally overpowered as horror movie specters tend to be), and yet the father burns alive with it because now the demon is full god machine. Paimon is able to completely possess the mother after that, and chooses to spook the son into suicide? Why not just possess the son and cut out the middleman? The best I can come up with is that the mother needed to be decapitated in parallel with her mother and daughter (not that we’re ever explicitly told how the grandmother ended up headless in their home outside of conjecture - maybe another instance of Paimon being the plot when necessary and never more than that), but is it even a tribute when you offer it to yourself? Im aware that’s super nitpicky so it’s not a big deal. Another nitpick would be that we’re never given a proper motivation for the family’s demon worship. Untold riches sure, but if that’s supposed to be fiscal wealth...how exactly does it benefit the now extinct family? I think it’d be interesting if the grandmother *did* have DID (though the mental illnesses hinted seem clearly to be Paimon’s doing) and he sought out a weak, irrational mind to take as his servant and vessel, similar to The Taking of Deborah Logan. However, this is never even hinted at and so it’s baseless conjecture on my part. 

The obvious comparison here is The Witch, which handles the dissolution of a family in a much more powerful way imo. In that movie, the titular character does like 3 or 4 things throughout the entire movie and the family tears itself apart with a conclusion extremely similar to that of Hereditary. There, the seeds of distrust, shame, and hate are only aggravated by this evil external force a handful of times, which remains consistently powerful throughout the movie. The difference there is that the antagonist is only as hands-on as she absolutely needs to be to get what she wants. Part of the oppressive terror of the movie is the understanding that the witch barely has to do anything to take what she wants. 

In Hereditary, the demon was all over the place in terms of strength and presence, which really took away from the story especially in the conclusion because it felt so out of place.

maybe she drowned her adult son trying to grant paimon a male vessel, then was granted custody of his son. or drowned her son in his youth, had another child, and waited for them to have a son.

But she only has a reaction to nuts at the party with her brother present (though I could be wrong about seeing those things since the moments were fleeting).

Clearly Ellens attempt to bring Paimon into Annies brother failed, so the next step was Peter. But Annie kept Peter away from her for good reason lol. So Ellen settled for Charlie, but because she was female Paimon couldn't fully possess her. Was her mental handicap to blame possibly? He couldn't fully possess her because of that handicap as well? Or maybe her handicap was caused by Paimon at birth or during her early development. 

Annie I believe was the one writing everything on the walls during her possessions or sleepwalking? So many great moments of foreshadowing.

I'm getting a little frustrated by the people saying that Peter dies after falling out the window. Also when reading explanations online that Peter became possesed in the classroom after hitting his head against the desk. Neither is true. As we know,  Paimon can use a host when at it's most vunerable. Paimon attempted to control Peter in the classroom, but failed as Peter was strong enough to fight it off by hitting his head against desk. Paimon had control for a moment, hence Paimon's ""click"" which was heard, but ultimately, Peter prevailed. Until ofcourse the end where he sees his own mother levetating in the air cutting her head off. Once this happens, and Peter by this time had already seen his father burned to a crisp, and a group of naked chalked up cult members smiling at him in the attic, he finally broke, and fell out the window into turf, which would not have killed him, but due to his vunerable state allowed Paimon to succeed. We saw this demonstated throughout the movie, when Annie sees her husband go up in flames, she screams for a moment, then succumbs to the evil spirit as she too became vulnerable. I also believe that the father had the same fate, we saw his decline, crying in the car, etc, and finally going up in flames the moment he decided he had to call the police on his wife for what he believed was her bringing the corpse of  his mother-in-law back into their home.",8pg2ma

The rest of the movie takes place in this ""miniature"" world. Much like the miniatures Annie create have no control of their own world, Annie's world is out of her control as well.

They hint at this theme twice:
1) when Peter is in class talking about whether it's more tragic to have the ability to make decisions but the decisions are terrible or your future is already predestined and bad things will happen outside of your control; and
2)A light source from outside this world that flickers and focuses and is later revealed to be Paimon shows up multiple times. I think he has created the world and this light mirrors Annie's light looking through her lens as she creates her own miniatures. We see Paimon's light in Peter's class room and when it finally enters Peter after jumping out the window.

The movie is making an argument that they are simply ""pawns in this horrible, hopeless machine.""

e88m4u1,"IN an interview the director confirms the demon in film is real and not a metaphor.He also states that Paimon alone has inhabited Charlies body since she was very young, that there originally there was a baby girl spirit or identity but she's long gone (*where*?). Since people asked, below. I am unable to link right now though but its easy to find.

In real life Paiman is demon mentioned in old occult books many of which are free online and there are definitely people who work with him, though people don't actually worship the Goetian_(in the 300 + yr Solomonic tradition demons are never worshipped but are lesser beings bound to do human will if evoked with the proper protocols (in addition to the triangle and cord circle , historically this included the mage praying to worshipping or otherwise welcoming first the protective prescence of Judaic God--- though in modern times, those who practice high or ceremonial magic to bid demons and those who worship YHVH ""god of Abraham"" tend not to overlap).
     I've only practiced  folk or""low"" (practical) magic or witchcraft or pagan religious purposes, and am more comfortable with ""right hand"" type ethical path, so I can't say the next part is in my experience....But i have read a lot of occult stuff on my journey, including the sub on Reddit and some of the qualities attributed to Paimon by this film are right on whereas others seem unlike the description s by mages historical or current.
     The list of his native re art, wealth etc is correct, and what he allegedly looks like ( a youth with masculine body and feminine face riding a camel ( sometimes the pretty face is just a mask on a stick), yes and yes to led by procession. Interestingly that the actor for Peter was a handsome middle eastern looking youth ) . I have never heard of the 3 heads or him holding decapitated heads ( tho many of the Goetia have 3 heads usually 2 are bestial).
    In the occult community Paimon is seen as one of the most patient ""nice"" or non-malevolent ""safer"", teacher paternal type for the Goetia ....common for him t be the 1st Goetia a mage evokes. This may also be bcuz he is not disturbing in appearance or bcuz he is considered quick and effective tho, too.
    I have also heard he is suspected to have been an indigenous deity that got rolled into a list of demons as many gods in many cultures were used this way by Chrisianity, and many *some*  ( NOT all) beings listed as demons in Abrahamic occult works can be traced back to having been the gods or goddesses of past cultures, some not even having to do with anything dark or negative. I've read its historically suspected Paimon is ***probably*** one of these as he is Protector Lord of the Caravans. People also report him claiming this history to them and basically that he settled for being a Abrahamic demon rather than being ""forgotten"". 
     Anyway I thought it was interesting out of ALL THE GOETIA , nevermind demons in other grimoires, the director chose one that looks pretty normal and known as *relatively* ( that being the operative word here) benign as far as these things go, definitely  more of a trickster or mischievous reputation , when there are plenty who are known to be downright *nefarious*. And very disturbing in appearances too! Lol. Just do a goetia Google image search.

Do yea I totally get he didn't want to drag out poor tired old Lucifer/Satan trope , but there is nothing about the demons behavior in the film that has to do with this demon that I've read --- no birds, heads, particular discomfort with women/girls (he even looks as one), etc. 
        Im just curious as to why the filmmaker chose something relatively obscure only to, aside from the general surface features, make up the creatures personality? Did he just like aesthetic look of sigil, was he just lazy, etc?",8pg2ma
e0cppoe,"So . . . massive spoilers, but I'm in love with this movie and definitely stuck on something.

Is Charlie ever really Charlie? Or is it Paimon the entire time? I'm thinking about it like this:

- It is revealed through dialogue that Charlie was Ellen's ""favorite""

- Charlie cuts off the birds head, and then draws a picture of said head with a crown on it (referencing the crown placed on Peter / Paimon's head later on)

- Echoing this, Charlie's actual head is used for the idol of Paimon in the treehouse

- During Annie's seance, when Charlie possesses Annie, her entire demeanor becomes totally different. This child talking through Annie isnt the Charlie from before. She's scared, loud, and crying out in confusion. I believe this is the only time we really hear Charlie, the little girl, without the influence of Paimon.

- This is the big one: Charlie creates these strange little toys, made from random, often broken objects. Joannie has these same kinds of toys on the ritual table in her apartment when Annie comes to talk to her.

- Another big one. Charlie draws pictures of the future, foreshadowing events to come. She draws pictures of Annie and Peter hysterical and upset, significantly prior to their disturbances in the film. There's also a foreshadowing connection between her and the bird, which I'll get into in a minute. Meanwhile, Paimon, as discussed in the film, is the demon price of foreshadowing, secrets and knowledge. This can't be a coincidence. Charlie has never been Charlie. She has always been Paimon, but in an insufficient vessel (as the cultusts note at the very end).

- The last big thing I'll note is the bird. In the beginning of the film, the bird flies into a window, Charlie (who I strongly believe is Painmon) cuts its head off, and draws the bird head with a crown on it. Later, Charlie looks out the car window and is decapitated by the telephone pole. The head is used for the idol of Paimon, and a similar crown is placed upon it. These two things mirror each other almost exactly, and show that Charlie / Paimon foreshadow the events of the film through the bird.",8pg2ma

What disturbed me as a practicing occultist who once attempted to work with Paimon back on an early twenties midnight acid trip (fell asleep within the Solomonic circle actually) was the usage of a close approximation (at the very least) of his goetic sigil.

Sigils are not just calling cards to entities; they are in many ways the entity themselves and hence the film acts as a conduit to channel the entity into the minds of the audience.

Using elements of the description of his abilities and attributes from the Lesser Key of Solomon grimoire further added to the creepiness factor.

This is interesting and possibly dangerous new territory for films where art can start to fray upon the ragged edges of consensual reality.

I disagree with their characterizations of daemons, the Goetic entities themselves, their “desire” to possess, and their capacity to do great harm — that was all kind of Judeochristian cliche, but the Goetia is not a system that is to be toyed around with and centering a story around actual Goetic spirits have been worshipped and worked with in the past and contemporaneously is quite possibly a watershed moment in horror that might start to creep beyond the screen of the viewer and into the mind and life of the observer.",8pg2ma

Annie said in her grief group (cult followers) that he was complaining that their mother tried to “put people in him.“

The demon of king paimon is transferred every time a head gets cut off. This is alluded to in the film with the book of spirits showing him on top of a mound of severed heads.  The movie shows, quite logically, four transfers. Similar to Denzel Washington movie “Fallen”... showing a demon that transfers himself by touch, if I recall.

First, we learn Grandma’s grave has been desecrated (and her head likely removed). This transfers the demon from grandma to the bird we see later in the photo/invoice emailed to husband showing the grave.

Second, the bird flies into the window at Charlie’ school and she cuts off its head. This is the demon transferring himself from the bird to Charlie.

Third, Charlie is beheaded (after eating chocolate cake that the demon “arranged” to be cut with the same knife used with the nuts...to which Charlie is very allergic).  This and the subsequent seance transfers the demon from Charlie to mom. 

Last, mom cuts off her own head with piano wire at the behest of the demon. This frees him to move into her son, Peter. The final vessel.

e0h787j,"Loved the movie. Aside from all the obvious highlights that everyone has mentioned here, some of the things that stayed with me are things that were implied but weren't explicitly shown in the movie. 

- Grandma's grave is desecrated and the body put in the attic while the family is living their normal lives in that house. That, along with the nighttime shot of the house with all the naked cult members standing around puts a terrifying image in my mind of how intrusive it must be to have the very people plotting your family's destruction inside your house while you were out running errands or working, to plant the decapitated corpse of your dead mother in your attic. 

- When Peter wakes up and Annie is on the wall in his room. We don't know how long she has been there. There could have been a few hours between Peter's dad being burned alive downstairs and him waking up, and to think of possessed Annie walking/floating/crawling up to his room, being fully able to kill him with no problem, but instead climbing up into the corner and waiting for him to wake up just so she could terrorize him to make him more vulnerable and a better host for possession is ridiculously unsettling to say the least. 

That as well as all the naked cult members already in the house, again, possibly for a few hours, just silently watching and waiting for Peter to wake up just so they could see him find his dead father, while his possessed mother hunts him all over the house. Knowing full well that they, or Annie could have killed him at any point, but since it was much deeper than that, it makes it that much more insidious. 

I just can't get the image of Annie, waiting on the wall for minutes or even hours, unblinkingly watching Peter, waiting for him to wake up out of my mind...",8pg2ma

The more I think about how the movie played on the more I realize how much more importants the son was. 

I mean the movie even starts in his room of a doll house to show that he is but a mere puppet in what will play out throughout the movie. The dolls symbolize the little control the family truly has for what is playing out in the movie.

I also love the childlike state the boy is forced into to show the transition of him going to a breaking point. 
1. He begins to say mommy instead of mom. 
2. He cried in his dads shoulder like a child at the séance
3. He screams mommy stop in the attic while she banged her head on the door.

e0ovvwm,"OK OK I just saw the film and i am shook in many ways but wanted to add some things i haven't seen in the comments: 
#spoiler people don't seem to have realised the significance of the scenes at the school. In pretty much all we hear class discussions of two ancient Greek tragedies and the aristotelian tragic tropes such as hamartia (fatal flaw causing tragic downfall) and free will under the control of fate (moira) explored through the euripidean plays Herakles and Iphigenia at Taurus. The tragic background of Herkales many don't know is that he was made mad by the goddess Iris and forced to kill his entire family. In Iphigenia at Taurus her father Agamemnon sacrifices her to allow the Greeks to sail to Troy under the command of the gods. DO YOU SEE A PATTERN?? 
A super important concept here is whether anyone actually has control - at grief counselling she mentions that she feels blamed, and in all the deaths there is technically no one assigned blame, and we find out at the end that it was all for the sake of Paimon. Perhaps he is a personification of the terror and loss of control through mental illness. 
I think there are many layers here, but this is definitely one of them! ",8pg2ma
e0p5or2,"I'm certain the cult put the mysterious herb in Peter's weed. Here's why: 

It's made clear in the script that Annie's mother fed baby Charlie mysterious herbs in her bottle as part of the ritual to make her a vessel for Paimon. This doesn't make it into the movie but we do see Annie pull an herb out of her mouth when drinking tea with Joan. So the mysterious herb is still part of the plot. 

There is a scene where Peter is smoking weed in his bedroom and blowing the smoke out the window. We see someone outside watching him when this happens. Later, he has a ""bad trip"" when smoking with his friends. He says he the same exact thing Charlie said  when she was choking after eating the cake. At first I thought this was because he was being paranoid and feeling guilty but I think the cult put the herb in his weed. They were sneaking into the house, after all, so it's possible. ",8pg2ma

e4u5289,"A lot of theories about beheadings leading to the transfer of the demon into the hosts ie Charlie to mum, mum to peter; all needed to be beheaded to transfer the demon to the next host. Also that the hosts needed to be in a weak state of mind to be susceptible to possession.

In this case, I don't think Charlie was possessed from birth. I believe she was groomed by the grandmother to the point where she relied on her fully. Then, when the grandmother died, Charlie was weak and vulnerable to possession. (This is shown when Charlie asks ""Who will look after me now?"") Hence why out of nowhere a pigeon kills itself to get to her. She then decapitates it to release the demon and gets possessed.

It wasnt just a hint to her being messed up, we were witnessing her being possessed in the begining. Also the lights shining around her seemed to be showing us that Charlie was not possessed yet.

This also makes sense with the grandmas grave being dug up followed by the pigeon scene. Meaning a cult member (or someone else; mabe grandmas pshycic friend) dug up the body and chopped off the head to release the demon, which then possessed a weak animal (pigeon) to use to get to Charlie.

I believe the grandma was hosting the demon until death.

e5w0zlc,"Man, what a great movie. The scene that got to me the most was when while the mother was having a nightmare, she described to Peter how she purposefully tried to have a miscarriage when he was in her womb. Just...wow.

edit: grammar, removed a word",8pg2ma
e7xrn0o,"My interpretation:
Grandmother Ellen summons Paimon using her daughter Annie as a host. Later she uses her young son but he suicides before being totally possessed, Annie is free.
(Vague clues for this supposition: Annie tells Charlie she was very masculine, didn't like dresses, dolls...Her work is like the hobby of the possessed Charlie. Compared to Peter the demon uses her body easily.)

The demon Paimon as the book says is vengeful if it is not summoned on a male host. I suppose Ellen discovers this late and tries to correct it with his son, her own blood (perhaps is needed for atonement), and when this fails with Annie's children. Annie doesn't want children (probably her subsconcious mind knows it's bad, the same when she walks in sleep), but her mother insists, their relationship sours and they separate, this saves Annie's son (Peter) from the ritual. Years later they reconcile and when Charlie is born Ellen uses the child to summon Paimon again and influence the family. I suppose Peter is safe all those years because she needs another ritual not for babies and Ellen ends with mental problems and Annie's husband establishes a communication protocol with her. 

However Ellen is the head of a cult, the cult when Annie is broken for her loses deceives her to perform the ritual using all her family. Annie at last realizes what is happening and what she has done and tries to burn her daughter's notebook as a solution thinking it is the link to the spirit world (it isn't, she was deceived) but it burns her. Then she tries to convince her husband to do it and die, this condemns her more, at last she throws it and her husband is burnt alive. She realizes what happened, loses her mind and is possesed.

At the end Paimon punishes Annie, posseses Peter and the cult adores him. The book said it was vengeful and pictured it carrying some severed heads, we know Ellen's husband died Annie's husband died and Charlie, Annie and Ellen ended decapitated, the three, a very symbolic number. ",8pg2ma
e857fty,"Just watched it and fuck me... That was tough as shit.

Being a horror film and all, the damn decapitation to me is a sign of what mental illness does to people.

e0b9rr4,"Quick question/thought on Charlie/Paimon - Is it just me thinking the possession never quite took when Charlie was still Charlie?

The way I see it, Charlie was either born female and thus left 'damaged' due to the demon inhabiting an imperfect host - she was never quite right but clearly a human child and not a demon. Or, Charlie was born developmentally challenged and also therefore 'imperfect'.

Either way, Charlie was Charlie throughout her life - not a demon masquerading. She was intended to host Paimon but as a girl child, could not do so properly. Until she died. Only when Charlie/Paimon were put into Peter was the fusion complete.",8pg2ma

This is an impressive movie to be coming from a first time writer/director. I am excited to see what he does in the future.

I'm a photographer and do some video production irl, so the thing that stood out the most to me was the unique cinematography.

The slow sweeping pans, and overall camera movement were very unique.

e0h0mx1,"Looking back, I don't think Annie's family members were ACTUALLY pathological at all (i.e. Annie's mom having Dissociative Identity disorder then dementia, father having psychotic depression, or brother having schizophrenia).

I thought at the beginning that maybe Annie was having some sort of psychosis, and Peter having something similar to that of Annie's late brother. Annie may have been wrongly diagnosed as a ""sleep walker"" when really, it was some sort of magic as well. That aspect of the movie is really interesting to me, because facevalue, I deducted some sort of genetic based mental health issues running in the family.

It has overtaken the Shining in my mind for best horror film of all time. That’s my serious opinion. It made me feel like a kid again just being controlled by and completely immersed in the movie.

However, for the second day in a row, the audience laughed hysterically towards the end, specifically the incredible shot of the headless mom floating into the treehouse. I already made a post complaining about a bad audience yesterday...but this one was even worse, despite there being even less people. Maybe only like 4 groups of people in the audience. All four of them were laughing hysterically and heckling towards the end. I’m completely disheartened in the theater experiences in general and in people’s tastes in movies in general. I’ve been dragged to see really really bullshit horror films before where the audience eats it up and screams and just has a blast. I feel like genuinely hurt here. My love for this film is passionate and I’m just fucking hurt. I thought the first night was just bad luck. Are people laughing as to not show weakness because they’re scared? Are they just not used to weird imagery? Like I totally understand being weirded out and thinking that it’s “out there” if you’re not used to trippy shit in movies but does it have to be heckled and laughed at? 

The worst part is, seeing it in a theater in theory should make the experience much better. The sound design, cinematography, and emotional impact all benefit on the big screen.

e0t4rvw,"Some questions about Hereditary:

* Was there any significance to Annie's father dying of starvation, other than being mentally ill? I mean, starvation. Wow.

* What was the idol about? Paimon, when he was in Charlie's body, also created idols. I assumed it was the biblical reference to a **false god**, but I feel like that can't be right in this context because then it would inherently allude to the fact that there is a **true god**, which feels like a whole other movie. Peter mimicked the idol pose right before he smashed his face into the desk and after seeing the light bounce around. Was Paimon just testing him in this scene? (The best I can figure is that Charlie, being Paimon, knew of the events to come and was creating placeholder idols to hold his spirit until he has a new body?)

* If Annie gets possessed by Paimon in her most vulnerable state, seeing ""the love of her life"" burst into flames, then what was that moment in the seance when she is seemingly possessed by Charlie and her husband splashes her with water? Was Paimon testing her vulnerability too?

* In the book (and implied in Ellen's note) it says that the conjurer would be heavily rewarded. How was Ellen ever rewarded? (There was a picture of her being showered in like, gold coins or gold petals or something, but that don't feel like much). Maybe given Queen-status among her cult-peers? Doesn't feel worth it! I mean, immortality or go home.

* Was it symbolic in the scene where Charlie sees a naked person in a burning bush, right before Annie dragged her home? Was this naked person Ellen?

* Significance of Charlie sleeping in the treehouse? Is the treehouse a symbol?

* I noticed some cinematographic symbols with red lights: the two red space heaters; the red reflection in Peters eyes when he looks at the treehouse; the whites of his eyes bloodied, the two red lights that the father nearly runs through. At first I thought it was like an homage to hell, but now that I see that there may have been an original ending of Peter removing his eyes at the end, does this symbolism mean something else?

* Can someone explain the hereditary component to this? I get there is some allusion to mental illness, but why is it a necessary part of Paimon's transition? Did it have to begin with Ellen, or could it be any old cult chick? Edit to add: I read Milly Shapiro's take on this. """"They don't really know what they're getting themselves into, and they don't know how to stop it, because there isn't really a way. It's something that was planned before they were born, and it's something that was always going to happen.""

* There's a theme of denial running throughout, culminating in Annie screaming this to Peter at the dinner table. Does this theme go deeper? Or am I just in the rabbit-hole of making meaning out of everything?

People have been praising Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne and Alex Wolff, but Milly Shapiro! Damn! I was so fascinated by her face and her micro-expressions, she has a lot of little nuances.

And what the hell kind of teenagers casually crush up some walnuts for a birthday cake in the middle of a party? Something wrong with dairy queen, or cake in a box?

It's the scene where they return from the grandmother's funeral, everyone comes in and takes their shoes off. The camera is inside the house before they enter through the front door, and for a brief moment, you can hear the sound of footsteps upstairs. So very early in the movie is a hint that someone else is in the house while the family is away.

However I now think that the inclusion of a family dog is a huge plot-hole. The dog adds nothing to the story \*except\* confusion. Are we to believe the dog never once sounded the alarm about cult members coming in and out of the house, carrying dead bodies?

e0v0vek,"I thought this film was very good but upon researching the films narrative and learning about the mythology of Paimon I now consider this a great movie. 

The biggest shock for me is the death of Charlie.

My mouth was agape at how Charlie was killed so soon and the brutality of the accident too! 

Hereditary is a very nuanced film, the tension slowly builds and then is ramped to maximum during the final scenes. 

As much as I loved this film, I would be careful recommending it. Hereditary is akin to horror movies such as The Witch, The Babadook, It Comes At Night, I find that these types of horror films appeal to a certain type of person. If you walk into the cinema expecting it to be full of jump scares then you’ll be disappointed. The film requires you’re full attention, every detail helps to unravel the mystery!

As far as the marketing for the film went, I think it suffered a similar fate as the aforementioned It Comes At Night. Both films were portrayed as more conventional horror movies thus bringing in an audience which may not understand the genre. This ended up affecting my cinema experience as there was people who either laughed through the entire film or kept talking about how much they didn’t enjoy it. Regardless of this I would still go back and see this movie again and get to experience all the subtleties that lead to the movies final

So when I hear a new movie in the same breath as, imo, the citizen Kane of horror films, that's some pretty damn big shoes to fill and usually does a disservice to the film itself.  So I went to check it out and mother of god, this movie was horror on another level.

The directing, the acting, the writing, the score, the scares are all on point. A master piece in filmmaking that would have Kubrick and Hitchcock smiling. No tricks or cheap thrills here. What you get is a slow burn of exhausting horror that really doesn't let up once it gets going. 

These two idiots next to me wouldn't shut the fuck up during the beginning of the film, cracking jokes, groaning that nothing scary was happening but about 20 minutes in they were completely silent because we were all sitting there clenching our sphincters in sheer horror watching this poor family go straight to hell.

Then obvious grief occurs with everyone throughout the film.  One way of looking at it is that in reality, no one in the family actually had a mental illness.  I.e.  grandmother is having these major personality quirks because, well, she is trying to raise one of the kings of hell; her husband has depression (seems straightforward for someone who married a mean, extreme devil reincarnator); and the son was trying to get possessed by his mother, eventually ending in his suicide, and this is interpreted as schizophrenia.

It was definitely amazing, I liked the uniqueness a lot. But I drew a lot of parallels to my own life and so I got a lot of off-screen fear while watching the movie. I cannot even walk in the dark of my house. I have never felt this much shock and adrenaline after watching a movie. I drove home with my eyes teary and constantly checked behind me.

First major scare was when Annie saw her mother in her workshop, usually I don't like seeing horror movies in a cinema because jump scares tend to get me. This scene made me realise early that hereditary's scare tactics were way more effective than jump scares.

The scene that's gonna stick with me without a doubt is Charlie's death. Child deaths in movies are always pretty fucked, but this hit me way harder than anything in last years It. The suddenness of it, while knowing exactly what was about to happen, Peter's immediate catatonic reaction, the dread of knowing her parents would discover what had happened the next day and the sickening hyperrealistic scenes after they did - and to top it off - the sudden and grotesque image of the severed head looking you right in the eye from the middle of the road.

As someone who experiences psychosis, I also really appreciated how it sorta captured perfectly what my paranoid psychotic episodes feel like.

e5qcnns,"I watched this movie late at night by myself with all the lights off and freaked myself out. I didn't know what it was about other than that it was horror and supposed to be good. A couple of observations

- excellent writing for the dialogues. The scene where the mom flips out and attacks/blames her son was exceptionally well written and acted. As was his quiet, measured response - you can see her face crack and the hatred and guilt show through. Annie's explanation of her character at a group therapy was also exceptional.

-the shifts in tone were remarkable. Starts out as a ghost story? Shifts to a story on loss of a child and slowly the focus shifts to the mom and then to the son. In parallel the mom's character starts seeming more and more crazy.

-i noticed the music amping up at times during the movie until the end when it was really strong.

Weird, creepy and deeply unsettling - unlike anything I've seen out of horror. I get why some people thought it 2as dumb but if you can overlook some of the flaws and go with the director's flow it's a great piece of horror. I felt like i had goosebumps for over an hour ",8pg2ma
e5t175x,"I watched Hereditary last night with the lights out and I was not prepared in any way for it to be THAT good. With Hollywood constantly churning out poorly written jump scare crap, I couldn’t believe what I was watching!This film was so unsettling from the head banging scene to the focus on Peter when his mum is wailing that she wants to die. I didn’t sleep a wink last night (no exaggeration) because I was constantly looking at all corners of my ceiling. I haven’t felt this effected by a horror in years and years. ",8pg2ma
e5ta7df,I’m upset.,8pg2ma
e7mvmgs,"I understand why some people have thought this one skimped on the horror - I don't think I jumped once, except at one early freak accident death that isn't (on the face of it) supernatural in character. It still scared the shit out of me for the mounting dread and emotional escalation - the latter of which may belong more to the genre of kitchen-sink drama, but which I can't shake from the horror of the various things that happen in the film. 

The relationship between Annie and Sam - which is grounded in real-life trauma - makes the various awful things that happen towards the end of the movie far more upsetting. In general this is what made this film such a uniquely wrenching experience, that all of the awful things were amplified by the nature of this increasingly toxic household.

The other thing that really got to me was this palpable sense that the family had absolutely no control over their own destinies. The dollhouse stuff rammed this home and creeped the hell out of me and then, even before the conspiracy comes to fruition, there are these tense shots of someone exhaling smoke as they watch Sam exhale from his window, of observers from across the street. 

The film is not about making you jump when a ghost emerges - even though plenty of ghosts emerge. There's a scene, for example, where a figure is lurking in the ceiling corner of a room, hidden to the character but not to the viewer. It's a creepy-ass shot. At the risk of sounding like an absolute tool, this is very much Hitchcock's 'when will the bomb go off' as opposed to 'ooh! explosion!' So, to circle off from my first point - while I understand the complaint that this isn't a jumpy movie (because it isn't), I don't think that's fair, because it is so obviously not what the film was trying to do. One's expectations have, of course, everything to do with your experience, but I'd really encourage the straw man I have just constructed to try to consider the film on its own terms.

Anyways I watched this film by myself last night and boy did I find it a mortifying experience. ",8pg2ma

How people laughed at Charlie's decapitation is beyond me.

Anyway.. back to the film. Loved the foreshadowing before the decapitation. Lingering on Peter's face after he hears the crunch, and when we hear Annie leaving the house. So, so powerful.

Also, I like how that seance slip was put through their mailbox, but Annie never went so Joan hung out around the Grief group instead.

e0hs7x6,"Regarding the distinction between the natural (mental illness, psychosis, DID, schizophrenia, etc.) and the supernatural (occultism, Paimon, etc.): 

I think what makes Hereditary such a masterclass in horror is that the director creates several layered interpretations upon which to parse through. The way I see it, there exists a Venn Diagram which consists of: things that can be explained solely via shared familial mental illnesses, things that can be explained solely via supernatural elements, and then things that can be explained by both at the same time. 

A few examples:

- Annie sleepwalking and nearly killing herself and her two children cannot rationally be explained via the supernatural. Paimon would have no vested interest in driving Annie to destroy the very vessel Paimon was vying for (Peter). Ultimately, Annie's sleepwalking is best explained as being part of a hereditary psychosis/schizophrenia inherited from her mother. That's pretty terrifying in and of itself. 

- Peter's throat closing up on him while smoking pot with his friends can't really be explained by anything supernatural. This is straight PTSD. Peter has a negative/traumatic association with marijuana given marijuana being a key component of his traumatic experience with Charlie. This is not to say that there is no possible supernatural explanation, but rather that this experience as it happens give us no reason to see any supernatural origin. 

- The family seance scene is a great example of an event that can be explained with either a supernatural or natural perspective. We can determine that Paimon tricked Annie into making her believe that she was linked to the journal/book, causing Annie to try and get Steve to burn it for her. Instead, Steve is no longer safe either, as Paimon has the capacity to cause him to burn alongside the book as well (perhaps Steve also got linked to it by touching it). HOWEVER, we can also determine that Annie is an unreliable narrator in light of her mental illnesses, and determine that it is entirely possible that she actually burned Steve alive herself much like she almost did to her own children. The fact that we are previously told that Annie's psychosis has caused her to almost burn her kids alive gives us good reason to read that scene as Annie's psychosis (this is the scene where she loses all control and becomes completely possessed) resulting in her burning her own husband alive. 

- Peter's whole classroom possession scene can also be explained both ways. He seems to be the only person who sees this beam of light zip around the classroom, and then to see his grinning reflection in the glass. The classroom's reaction to his ""possession"" indicates that his experience can be read as pure psychosis. 

The brilliance of Hereditary is its ability to ambiguously and questionably present competing and sometimes conflicting explanations for its horrific events. 

10/10, will watch a third time and cannot wait for the DVD. 

P.S. has anyone ever utilized two characters having a shared nightmare the way Ari Aster did in this film (the lighter fluid nightmare between Annie and Peter)? It was so amazingly terrifying. ",8pg2ma

It is in fact the best horror film I've seen in a looooong time, since Oculus and The Babadook, which all three movies have a similar feel to them. Lots of ""is this really happening of is so-so character hallucinating?"" moments.

I really thought this was going to end in the mom having dementia/schizophrenia which her family had(hence hereditary) There are many scenes that hinted towards that theory, I thought Joan was going to end up being a fake and it would turn out the mom did everything. There was a scene near the end where Annie goes to Joan's place but she's not home, but the camera pans to a security camera. Making me believe we would see footage of Annie talking to herself.

Only problem I had was the ending, which I had the same issue as with The Babadook, where they made ""it"" real. I wished they stayed in the ""it was all in their head"" realm.

e0f5mwb,"I’m blown away.

Whenever someone asks me to explain the difference in creativity and skill i’m gonna show them Get Out and Hereditary (loved both) . Hereditary doesnt introduce anything new but it does everything so skillfully and deliberately that I can’t do anything but applaud the director. The accident scene and the aftermath easily make my best scenes ever list for all movies. The director really has a solid understanding of “less is more”. The way you knew what was coming when we see Peter’s face in the morning and hear the mother kiss her husband goodbye for work was just brilliantly done and then the fucking screams when she opens the door... my goodness I got chills down my spine. If you have a younger sister I know you can relate to that feeling of “if anything happens to you...” it just hit too close to home

The sound design was excellent and the pacing of the story was excellent. I hesitate to call this movie a slow burn because while there isnt always action happening you constantly feel like the movie is throwing visceral punch after punch relentlessly making the payoff all the more worth it. This movie tackles mental illness way more skillfully than The Babadook ever did (it was wayyy too on the nose for my liking) while giving you a layered story to sink your teeth into the more and more you think about it

There was a lot of uncomfortable laughter (“you were trying to pull my head off!!”) Do you guys think this was intentional or was that just my theater? I know some of you guys had bad theater experiences but i think the laughs in my theater at certain parts were genuine uneasiness

I’ve learned to easily convince myself that it’s nothing, and it usually ends up being a curtain in my room or something. But in my head it’s so human-like it’s undeniable.

That scene at the beginning where Toni Collete turned off the light in her studio and grandmas outline is sitting there in the afterbirth of the light... they fucking nailed that sinking sensation of terror I still to this day get at night.

Charlie standing against the wall also nailed that feeling, but that first scene with grandma in the corner as the lights flashed off made my skin crawl and brought up some terrible emotion in me.

The head on the road was pretty fucking visceral. I feel like horror films are spotty when it comes to audience response. My theater had a few people giggling through inappropriate scenes and/or making clicking sounds throughout. I get some younger dudes want to show off for their dates or some people laugh nervously as a defense mechanism, but it takes me out of it sometimes. 


Anyway. When that scene came up, it was dead silent. The only audible reaction was me very loudly saying  “Oh *shit*.” I thought others would have reacted much more loudly given the stuff they reacted to earlier in the film but nope, was me on an island out there. 



I think though the scene that stayed with me the most was Collette’s screaming after Charlie’s death. Tough for me to remember a scream that real, that bone chilling and visceral.

Most of my thoughts on it have already been discussed but I wanted to point out the one thing that I kept noticing and appreciating though the whole film. 
The use of the camera shots. I know it’s probably just common sense directing but I was really impressed with how much the camera angles hiding things from us, keeping scenes still and tense while we wait to be shown whatever it is the character is looking horrified at. Again, basics. But I guess you can call me easily impressed if you’d like. I thought it was done beautifully. Through the whole film I just felt that visual storytelling was enhanced so much by the smart cam directing, tension controlled so well. Between that, and the more vague shots like the wide ones showcasing what looks like a miniature model version of their house in the trees, I felt taken on a trip. I can finally say I have a favorite horror movie. 10/10",8pg2ma

One thing that I haven't seen mentioned was the scarring on Annie's wrist. I noticed it when she was going through her mother's books the second time.

e0b4mi6,"Just got out of the theatre and I am SHOOKETH. This is a pretty extraordinary horror film.

\- The family drama aspect of the movie was extremely well done, I thought. Even putting the horror stuff aside it’s a strong depiction of the pain and dysfunction that can get passed down through generations. The confrontation scenes between Annie and Peter in particular were so searing and loaded with those deep, dark feelings that you’re not supposed to say out loud.

\- Toni Collette is fucking volcanic. Unbelievable performance. I saw a woman unravel before my very eyes and I couldn’t look away. If the Oscars were based on merit alone she’d be an absolute shoo\-in, but alas. The rest of the cast is great too.

\- Ari Aster has a hell of a knack for vivid, memorable horror imagery. My god. The shot of Charlie’s head covered in ants, Peter contorting in the classroom, the grinning naked bodies, Annie decapitating herself with the piano wire, etc. But he’s just as good at the little things that get under your skin. I loved the tilt\-shifted establishing shots, that fabulously creepy opening where we zoom into the diorama and those jump cuts where it transitions from day to night. It’s unreal this is his first feature film because he fucking gets it.

\- There are so many subtle little details in this movie. So many lines that don’t seem like much at first but reveal themselves later. Remember when Annie’s at the support group and she mentions that her brother killed himself because he accused Ellen of trying to “put people into his body”? Or when Charlie says that Ellen wanted her to be a boy? Or Annie mentioning the faces she’s never seen before at Ellen’s funeral? How about that suggestion that Ellen insisted on breastfeeding Charlie when she was born, which might explain why Charlie is so sickly and poorly socialized (making her more ""vulnerable"" for the possession)? Just a really carefully and tightly written script.

Loved this movie so much. I can’t get enough of intelligent, inventive, bold horror like this.",8pg2ma
e0b8pjw,"X\-posting my take from r/horror: I found this horrifying from the perspective of watching mental illness eat away at both Toni Collette's character and her son. The supernatural is present in the film and used to metaphorically drive at the theme of mental illness, but I thought a lot of the events could literally be pointed to as psychotic in nature even within the reality of the film.

Toni Collette clearly plays Annie as having a gradual mental breakdown, and a lot of what happens to Peter (self\-harm at school) struck me as manifestations of a mental illness as well. Many of the supernatural occurrences can be viewed as hallucinations, with only very few of them (objects moving on their own) unable to be explained by natural events. Annie speaking as Charlie could be a manifestation of dissociative identity disorder like her mother. I interpreted the husband being burnt to death as a murder committed by Annie, presented visually in accordance with *her perception* of it (the film previously established that Annie has tried to commit murder of family members via arson while in a semiconscious state). The supernatural phenomena around Peter was mostly visual and auditory, which dovetails with Annie's brother having been an adolescent paranoid schizophrenic.

In addition, I felt the focus on the dollhouses and framing of some of the shots of the home to match rooms in the dollhouses indicated that the true horror was primarily domestic and intrafamilial.

I walked away with a take on the narrative where the stress of Ellen and Charlie's deaths, plus Ellen and Joan's supernatural beliefs, push Annie into a nervous breakdown, which then pushes Peter over the edge as well. The coven plotline was cool, but to me it was window dressing for the other themes.",8pg2ma
e0c3zjd,"I think the sequence following Charlie's death, where Peter drives home silently, gets into bed and lies there in the morning with his eyes open as his parents discover her body is one of the most upsetting things I've ever seen in a movie.

You can totally feel exactly how shellshocked he is, how he can't even begin to imagine how he could tell his parents, and how he's numbed into taking a passive role in them finding out, which plays out so horrifically. It's such an insane circumstance but when I imagine how I would ever realistically react if I were in that situation it makes a horrible kind of sense and that empathy makes it so impactful.",8pg2ma

e0bftfr,"I haven’t seen anyone mention it in this thread, but this movie really reminded me of Killing of A Sacred Deer. Especially because at one point while Peter’s at school the teacher is explaining that Iphigenia had to be sacrificed because she was chosen by the gods.

e0gg8j7,"I had an interesting experience watching this film. I would say that the scenes up until Charlie’s death were largely from the trailers and just typical creepy horror movie stuff (ghost of the grandma, creepy child, etc). I felt creeped out and intrigued during this portion of the movie. 

Then Charlie’s death scene happened and I was absolutely shocked and horrified. The following scenes filled me with dread and the rest of the movie after that I was really anxious and disturbed. The ending left me feeling like I had just watched something really disgustingly evil. 

Anyway, from the trailers, I couldn’t tell what direction this film would go in. I thought it could be like The VVitch, slow and smart with not much action but just an eerie vibe to it. I also thought it could be more similar to The Conjuring, with lots of ghosts/demons, pop ups and haunted houses. 

Turns out, it was a mixture of both.. I found this very interesting. Many horror fans do not like the sub genre of horror including movies like It Follows, The Babadook and The VVitch. But Hereditary wasn’t exactly like those films, even though they share qualities. There were scenes in this movie that reminded me of Rosemarys Baby and The Conjuring and even Insidious. It was like a cross between the slow, artsy and ambiguous horror film and the fun, scare-filled and fast movies. 

Hereditary had a slow pace up until the end but it also was more shocking than movies like The VVitch while being disturbing at the same time. It’s hard to even place it in a category. It touches on mental illness, but it’s not like The Babadook where you aren’t sure whether the monster is real or not. The supernatural is very real as well as the mental illness in Hereditary. 

I am both traumatized and impressed by this horror movie, especially from a new director. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to get certain scenes out of my head tbh. 

Also... there’s an underrated film available on Netflix (it’s a European film) called ‘A Dark Song’. It’s a slower movie but it’s very creepy and it reminds me a little of Hereditary and The VVitch. It’s the last movie that gave me nightmares before Hereditary!

This got me thinking, so is the evil spirit involved? Just like the “cult” members? Trying to lead Annie to Joan to ensure she does the séance?",8pg2ma
e0m12s8,"I want to throw this theory out there..ive been threading the needle through a variety of different topics on the boards and this pretty much stands up but welcome any feedback...here goes...

I believe that Paimon and 'Charlie' (the name Joan calls the Paimon\-possessed Peter at the end) are one and the same...I believe this affectation originates from Paimon originally inhabiting Ellen's / Queen Leigh's husband 'Charles'.  King and Queen.  He even had his own doormat!

I think that the starvation that kills Charles is either the 'real' Charles fighting back, or maybe its just that the vessel for Paimon is genuinely not strong enough for him anymore (I like the former).   Either way Paimon or 'Charlie' as he is affectionatly known needs another host.

The natrural successor at this point is their son (and Annie's brother) who eventually killed himself because 'she was always trying to put people inside of him'.  It was clearly unsuccessful.   During this time...Annie has a son of her own, Peter... who becomes the next obvious candidate ...but she keeps him far away from Ellen (Annie also speaks of wanting to abort or miscarry..there was a sense that he would always be in danger that Im not sure Annie herself understood...why try and abort the son you love).

Until one day she describes Ellen moving into their house.  Ellen sees that Annie is having another baby (she watches Annie / Steve make love in one of the diaramas) and the plan moves to having Paimon inhabit this girl instead.  Ellen 'sinks her claws' into her..Im sure had influence in naming the child 'Charlie' in honor of her husband and King \- and I believe that possession happened almost from birth \- and Queen Leigh nurtures her 'Charlie' through breastfeeding and becomes very close ...but always reminds her (and vicariously the spirit) that she 'shouldve been born a boy'.  Queen Leigh knows this can only be temporary...but the bloodline strength is buying them some time \- Peter is the master plan

(I will also postulate that in between the unsuccesful attempts in the period between Annie's brother and the girl Charlie...there may have also been possession attempts with her followers' male brood ...such as Joan's husband and son....these all failed)

SO here we have a film called Hereditary about a Queen, her King 'CHarlie' Paimon and the doomed family tree this will rot away at...a motif as clear as day on the poster.  Steve didnt know what he was marrying himself into, Annie I feel subconsciously knew through her sleepwakling, nightmare visions, wanting to abort Peter, then keeping peter away ...that there was something inherently bad / evil about her mother....she wasnt wrong.  Peter was doomed from the start...he was always going to inherit the crown.

I love how the subtext of what Hereditary means (mental or physical illness) played a strong thematic role in this movie...and how it is woven in by the writers ...of course Peter and Annie bear signs of this, they are the  conditions required for possession...inherited paranoia / schizophrenia are the logical explanations for Annie's and Peter's vulnerability...it just so happens that unfortunately for some people...they really are out to get you.

By the way ..the last clue for me was that final picture of 'Queen' Leigh...a hereditary royal blood line, and the 'crown' iconology we see throughout the movie...you can really start to thread the needle back from here.  That last mention of 'Charlie' from Joan to Peter was no accident and makes complete sense to me now",8pg2ma

It just seems really strange that the exhibit would be calling and bothering her about the work knowing that she just lost not only her mother, but also her daughter (and via a horrific freak accident). The phone call she gets in particular seems strange because the person leaving the message seems very casual about everything and almost downplays the sheer emotional weight of what Annie must be going through. It seems like a normal empathetic human being would have left a message more along the lines of ""hey Annie, so sorry to hear about your back to back tragic losses. If you need any emotional support or anyone to talk to, we are here for you. We know you do excellent work and can't wait to see your exhibits soon."" Or something closer to that than what we got in the message. 

Also, when she receives the email, it just seems strange that they would add that level of work pressure on her amidst all the tragedy, and then write ""we promise we won't judge you"" with a winky face at the end. Almost taunting Annie while still adding pressure. 

I think it's a testament to Ari Aster's script and overall filmmaking chops that its' not clear whether it's just a natural stressor or a supernatural stressor\-\-but I actually do think that the emails and phone calls Annie received asking for updates on her work were inspired by the cult/Paimon.

e0gzoel,"Beyond the wonderful performances by the cast, I found the way this movie was framed and shot was perfect. The camera being locked down (with the exception of two shots I think) was the perfect choice to create the sensation of an omnipotent presence watching over this family. The smooth camera movements established an eerie sensation from the opening shot. I loved the usage of tilt\-shifting in some of the establishing shots. It made it hard to immediately tell if what was happening on screen was rooted in reality or just Annie messing with the miniatures. The use of lighting (or the lack thereof) to create atmosphere was wonderful as well. There were some scenes were the lighting was so low that your eyes had to adjust for a moment to see what's hidden in the darkness. The stuff nightmares are made of.",8pg2ma
e0haczj,"I adore this film. Genuinely gave me anxiety and I couldn’t sleep at all when I got home. I’m a sucker for occultism, mysticism, esotericism, and neoplatonism so when I saw the symbol of Paimon, I was probably the only weirdo in the theater that recognized that on the mother’s necklace at the funeral. Yms complained about the teenage kid’s crying and I disagree. He’s still a 14-17 old kid that just wants to smoke pot and get laid. When tragedy strikes everyone genuinely sounds like that at that age. That poor bastard was traumatized to the fullest extent and for his crying to sound that vulnerable and fragile is totally feasible. 

All horror films are essentially the same plot(a family being terrorized by a vaporous malevolent entity, be it supernatural or psychological), it’s just a matter of execution. True horror is manifested by anxiety not by scares. Scary is just a monster, but once you know bullets can kill it or it’s explained, it ceases to become scary. Anxiety is much more patient and it slowly sinks it’s fangs into you, once you notice it’s already too late. 

Excellent flick. 9/10 definitely lingers in the depths of your psyche long after credits. Hail Paimon ",8pg2ma

e0uz9i9,"1. It was so refreshing that Charlie was not bullied-- she's not a Carrie. The isolation made it sadder.
2. The mental illness red herring takes all.
3. Aster def knows how to balance the everyday drama of family with fucking insane weirdness. It never felt overdone. The subtle things, like the breath on Annie'a face during the seance, make this film so rich.
3. I love the thought of this powerful entity being encapsulated not just in the physical being of a little girl (a demon possessing an innocent is very trope-y) but in her soul. It just seems more real, that Paimon would needed to be melded into a living thing over time rather than just dumped into a body and immediately having full control. It makes me sad to think that she was poisoned. It wasn't just possession; he took her mind and her whole being, too.

The thing I value most is that this film complicates the act of possession, which, to a person raised in an extreme fundamentalist sect that centers on an ongoing battle against literal ""demons,"" is fascinating.",8pg2ma

e0x8t7u,"I don't know if it's just because I was pretty tired by the time I watched Hereditary last night, and I consider myself to be quite thick skinned with horror films, but honest to God that accident scene made me nearly faint at the sheer amount of guilt I was feeling on behalf of Peter. I've been immersed in films before and have sympathised with characters but this film made me empathise as if I was in Peter's shoes and it made me sick. Absolutely fantastic scene that I'm not sure I ever want to see again. 

As for the rest of the movie I will say that I loved The Witch and going into this film with that knowledge I found it very similar in terms of the story structure so the ending wasn't entirely surprising to me. That being said the cinematography, editing, framing, acting, score (every element besides the story itself which is still really good) is breathtaking.

e1fu2ns,"I thought the way they portrayed the stoners/partying in this movie was pretty spot on. If they’d gone into more detail with the party dialogue, this realism definitely might’ve been been compromised, but they stayed detached enough so that it wasn’t at all unrealistic. Half my friends were high during the movie (no way I was doing that shit, fuck watching horror movies high), and we just looked at each other during those scenes and laughed at how accurate they were. I will say though that Alex just bringing Charlie along to the party was EXTREMELY strange to me, but I think it’s just hard to remember she’s actually 13 and not like 10 or something (I have a sister around the same age as the latter number, so I kinda perceived Charlie as being younger than she was due to that in conjunction with her weak social skills/slight disabilities). Still, while I’ve totally been to parties with my sophomore sister, I don’t think I’d ever take a freshman to one. Assuming she’s a freshman. ",8pg2ma
e32vkdk,"I saw this film last night and think it's awesome. I read a review in my language which described it saying ""watching Hereditary was like having a two hour panic attack"". Even though I don't have a panic disorder I think I felt something similar. At some point I noticed I involuntarily had started to breath short breaths and that my muscles were tense even though there was nothing particularly horrible happening in the movie.

I've been diagnosed with PTSD years ago, and think that, for me, the most terrifying thing about Hereditary was that it symbolically represented the psychological trauma in the mind of a traumatized person: intense fear that something important is permanently destroyed, shame, feeling of hopeless regret, sudden total loss of self-control. 

The scene where Annie yells at Peter ""I didn't want to have you!"" and then slaps her hand over her mouth in horrifying regret, and Peter cries ""You tried to kill me!"" is a situation that would most likely permanently damage a relationship between a mother and a child. Fortunately it was just Annie's nightmare, but it's scenes like this that feel ""trauma-like"": horrifying regret, permanent loss, destruction.

Sometimes trauma can even cause one to speculate what really happened (and what really didn't). If the real thing causes too much psychological pain, mind can actually confabulate fictional stories to cover it; fake memories. The confabulations might be just as horrifying as the real trauma, but they're crucially different: so if the person in the actual trauma event has done wrong (or at least, believes so him/herself), the confabulation could represent him/her as a victim, or the other way around.

Probably the scariest scene for me was the one where Peter was sitting on school yard and he saw Joan standing about 50 meters away behind the fence and calling him with this weirdly loud voice that sounded like it was coming from Peter's own mind.",8pg2ma

This movie in the theatre creeped me out. It’s not perfect, the soundtrack was good but maybe a little unnecessarily loud, the plot was disjointed in some respects whether intentional or not (and some noggins wonderfully disjointed). The acting was great with a couple of weak points (the crying of Peter near the end).

The way the visual of the miniatures were used, and the lighting to barely show apparitions in the dark that may be tricks of the eyes - spooked me on a childhood-trauma level. The jarring appearance of fat naked people.

e0elxay,"I tried to pay closer attention to some scenes that people were curious about during my second viewing of the movie.    


Here are some things I noticed:    



* The M&M candies that Charlie was eating while she was making a figurine came from a yellow packet (it was sitting in the clutter on her desk,  next to the candies) so I'm assuming they were peanut. There were a few people that mentioned she could have a tree nut allergy and this could be meaningless, but there are also people who think her ""allergy"" wasn't real, or was heavily influenced by Paimon to act as a catalyst in the events that led to her death.    



* It seems like they made it a point to show Peter riding his bike for transportation for the remainder of the movie after Charlie's death. I'm not sure if he wasn't driving because of legal repercussions from the accident (losing his license?), because his parents refused to let him drive anymore (as a punishment), or because he was so mentally scarred by the whole thing that he chose not to drive anymore.

* Regarding people wondering about the timeline after Charlie's death: when Joan stops Annie outside of the grief support meeting after Charlie died, she mentions remembering Annie ""from a few months ago"" when she came after her mother's death. Since Charlie died close to the time the grandmother died, I'm assuming a few months had passed between Charlie's death and the rest of the events in the movie. It's also possible that Peter recieved some sort of repercussions for the accident during this time, but nothing is said for certain about it.    


* The figurine on the summoning/seance setup on Joan's kitchen table when Annie is banging on her door trying to get inside is the same figurine that Charlie was making in an earlier scene in the movie. (It's the one made with a travel sized Gold Bond powder container, and a decapitated bird head. She was working on it during the classroom scene.) This confirms, to me, that members of the cult had to be inside of the family's house at some point, maybe around the same time they moved the grandmother's body in. Either that, or Charlie/another family member gave the figurine to them at some point, which I guess is also a possibility. I guess it could be one that Joan made herself, too, but it was definitely made of the same materials that Charlie was using, so I'm not sure.

A couple people in my theatre laughed at tense moments, too, but I was genuinely disturbed, sinking down in my seat.

The part where Annie is screaming and they show Charlie’s ant-infested head literally made my stomach drop. Another thing that REALLY creeped me out was at the end, when Annie was hiding in the corners of rooms, out of Peter’s view, but the audience could see. UGH! I’m still not fully okay yet... 

I have a question, though: I didn’t understand Peter just driving home after Charlie died. That was just way unreal to me. He swerved because of the animal in the road, but like, he was high, so, wouldn’t there have been an investigation? Or at the very least, cops? It was just weird to me.

I wondered why choose such a relatively obscure demon like Paimon?

The quote:  ""Paimon is also called by the Rabbins by the title of OZAZL, [Azazel](https://www.deliriumsrealm.com/azazel/), which is a name used in Leviticus with reference to the Scape\-Goat. Its derivation is from OZ, = a Goat; and AZL, = to go away. It has frequently been warmly discussed whether the word in question means simply the Scape\-Goat, or whether it signifies a Demon to whom that animal was dedicated.""

Maybe this is a coincidence, but could the director have chosen the demon Paimon to act as the scape\-goat for all of the real life horrors borne of mental illness that are heaped on Annie's family?

One thing that hit me really hard that I don’t see many other people talk about is the scene when Peter is toking with his friends and has a panic attack where he experiences what Charlie experienced before she died. From personal experience, it really captured the terror and paranoia that weed can put on you if you are dealing with trauma or anxiety, even when it’s something you’ve done a million times before, as well as how it can make you look kinda crazy to the people you’re around who aren’t experiencing what you feel as so real. Really illustrated imo the way that mental disorders can just manifest themselves in people seemingly out of nowhere, and completely change what was once your normal everyday life.

It’s also a really good parallel to later in the movie when he is forced to slam his head on the desk but to everyone else it just looks like he’s crazy and doing it to himself, when in reality it’s brought on by things he can’t control and no one else feels, just like the panic attack.

Was Annie trying to get away from the ritual and save her son from it? 
There was also that note at the beginning from the grandma that said something like “all of this will be worth it” so there was obviously something Annie didn’t want her mom to do, most likely with Charlie. And after the part where she throws the book into the fire place and kills her husband her mood instantly changes. Was she in on it the whole time?

It balances the literal events of the cult and demonic possession perfectly against the metaphorical themes of family, mental illness, and fate. The last act of the film was a riveting, surreal ride. The scene when Peter wakes up in bed and as our eyes adjust to the dark, we slowly realize that Annie is unnaturally pressed against the wall and ceiling had my heart pounding.

Maybe her deformities, allergies, and illnesses were a result of these attempts, which left a mark on her.

Right at the end of the movie you hear Joanie mention how Paimon will basically teach them the secrets and mysteries of the universe, and in the mythology Paimon is a basically Lucifer's left\-hand man.

I came out of the theater in such a weird mood, but I couldn't stop thinking of the movie. When a movie affects me like that I really appreciate what the director was able to accomplish.

e0i6og5,"I really liked this movie - performances were fantastic, atmosphere, tension, pacing, cinematography (and gutsy move to let whole swaths of the frame go to all black). Easily one of the most anxiety inducing horror movies ever made.

Except the ending. Really disliked the ending.

I really think the dumb test audience feedback, which resulted in the sledgehammer ADR explaining exactly what's happening, spelling out the cult ritual, and losing the eye gouging, did this movie a disservice.

When things are spelled out so explicitly, it calls into question the logic of all the previous scenes. It brings logic into a movie that's about visceral emotion. So if it IS in fact, a cult ritual, then what's going on with the headless body floating? Or how did the dad get burned instead of the book? I think in a horror movie like this one, more information just leads to more questions (and questions I don't really want the answers to).

I'm comfortable with the idea of the movie not explicitly saying one or the other. I'm comfortable with it being BOTH cult ritual and mental illness, because I think the symbolism and subjective storytelling allows you to get a really interesting perspective and commentary by combining those two concepts. I like how it can be understood as both the horror of a satanic cult viewed through the lens of mental illness, or mental illness actualized through the symbolism of a satanic cult.

In short, I wanted ambiguity, and in the last two minutes, the movie felt the need to spoon feed me answers in an info dump that really felt out of place.

e0iiecd,"I don’t know for sure if this was the case, but I think that the choice to have Annie be an artist who makes miniatures based on her life was inspired by the work of Frances Lee Glessner, an early forensic investigator who made miniature recreations of actual crime scenes. Glessner’s miniatures all take place within domestic settings and often suggest incidents of domestic violence/family turmoil. The miniatures were originally created as a teaching aide for forensic students at Harvard to learn how to investigate a crime scene and piece together the story based on visual evidence and initial police reports. I feel like Hereditary as a film kind of functions in a similar way: as we watch we are trying to put together the mystery of what’s happening in the big picture, picking up on small details that are both visual and expository (i.e Charlie eating peanut M&Ms, Joanie’s story about her son and grandson, etc).

e0xl47h,"Amazing movie. Gripping, chilling, sickening. Absolutely lived up to the hype for me. Some takeaways: 

— My favorite element was the very gradual reveal of the story. Most of the film I felt I was watching a character study with some surreal and horrifying set-pieces. Only near the end did it become clear that the story was driving the action more than the characters themselves, which was a brilliant twist in and of itself. For example, a lot of Charlie's behaviors at the beginning feel like quirks typical of a dark character study. NOPE, she's a vessel for a demon king. The film withholds any real exposition until literally the last possible moment, at which point we see how well everything ties together.

— The accident. Everything from the allergic reaction to Annie's discovery the next morning amounted to one of the most stomach-turning experiences I've ever had in a theater. The unforgettable image of Charlie's head felt a little gratuitous in the moment, but was totally justified by the continued development of the story and the recurring motif of decapitation. 

— My single favorite spook of the movie had to be Annie slamming her head on the underside of the basement hatch. It took an already-terrifying moment to another level. We hear her beating on the other side, Peter is screaming ""Mommy,"" and then BAM. Other highlights include Charlie speaking through Annie's voice, the smiling naked man who was also smiling at Charlie during the viewing at the beginning, and the reveal of all the freaky shit in Joanie's apartment. 

— The level of detail in this movie was astonishing, and reflected in Annie's miniatures. There were scenes when a tiny, lit window on the side of the frame spooked me more than anything. There's nothing I love more in cinema than when a film creates resonance between its various components, on macro and micro levels. This movie is a masterclass of building that sort of self-contained vocabulary of symbols and images. Certain details didn't feel necessarily literal (the cult symbol on the telephone poll, glimpsed when Peter is on the way to the party) and this really helped set up the sort of bait-and-switch I describe in the first bullet point. There is enough art-house fuckery to disguise the compelling story underneath.

— A few minor gripes, in the name of fairness. 

1. Peter really never apologized? I liked that he went straight to bed and left his mother to discover the body. This felt believable considering the shock of the incident, and was just an absolutely wicked choice on the writer's part. But he *never* apologized? Not even for leaving the car out front? Chalk it up to teenage immaturity, I guess. 

2. The dad felt a little under-developed compared to the other characters. I guess the point was that he was expendable in the grand scheme, not being blood to the grandmother. Does anyone have any interpretation for why he burst into flames? I like that not everything in this film adds up neatly on the surface, but it's weird to me that the book threatened to burn Annie, only to burn him instead.

3. This is a minor point, but Peter being driven home unconscious and hauled inside by his parents was a little odd. Were they coming from the hospital? Did the nurses schlep him to the car and say ""you're on your own!"" Maybe he fell asleep on the ride home, still under influence of anesthetic. Just seemed like a weird choice when he could've simply come home woozy and fallen asleep.",8pg2ma
e0xpilw,"So glad I caught this at the cinema knowing virtually nothing beforehand so all the twists and turns were fresh (the decapitation came out of nowhere especially since what little I *had* seen about the film focused so heavily on Charlie). Toni Colette and Ann Dowd were particularly great - horror films tend to be overlooked during awards season but I'd love to see this film get some recognition there.

Anyway. Great film and probably the best horror I've seen since The Witch. I do agree with some of the criticism that it starts to go off the rails and becomes more generic in the 2nd half, but I have a soft spot for films about cults, the occult and demons so it was a pleasant surprise (ok, maybe not ""pleasant"") to find that's where the film wound up. There were a few moments I wish it had been more subtle about (i.e. levitation) but it never stopped being unsettling to me... and have to give it credit for managing to pull everything together in the last 20 minutes or so because I had no idea if/how it would.

Also - what a great score! I'm not familiar with Colin Stetson but hope to hear more from him, it was beautiful in places and disturbing in others... and often a combo of both, with some sounds I've never heard before. The music over the end sequence was absolutely perfect.",8pg2ma

On the other hand perhaps it was “just a necklace” in her mind, or something she wore to demonstrate a closeness with her mother even though Annie is unaware of what exactly she has on. I never know what is misdirection or simply when I am reading into something too closely.

\-obviously the whole car incident was incredibly shocking. Why did'nt the kid tell his mom or dad what happened before he went to bed or in the morning? I assume he was too traumatized/shook to do anything. The shot with the girls head on the road must be terrifying for the parents watching.  

\-at the end, they said they found the first male host. I cant say when the phenomenon started happening, but did it not occur once prior years or hundreds of years down the line of ancestry to possess a man? 

\-can someone explain the order of the body hopping? a lot of body switching happened at the same time in the movie. i think it started with Annie's mom with died, and her brother hanged himself, then the pigeon killed itself at the school window, then Charlie and so on.

That said the nightmare scene when the mom is yelling at Peter about trying to abort him and then it cuts to them both soaked in paint thinner was great. Also the music at the end was incredible and really sold it too — I like that it wasn’t some forced resolution, they decided to go full dark. Some things were kind of unforgivable though — a solid amount of awkward dialogue, the stupid tongue clicks, undeveloped characters.

If it was the little girls, then what happened to the Grandma's body from the cemetery? If it was the grandmas body in the Attic, then how come her head was missing. I thought the body in the Attic looked a little too big for the little girl. 

Secondly, what was going on with the mom that she was able to crawl on walls, hang from the ceiling, and was able to cut her own head off and levitate up to the treehouse?

I think the ending with the praying wasn't really that scary as much as it was weird. The cult made me laugh since everyone was naked and I didn't really want to take all that seriously. But I seriously loved this movie.   


The only flaw I had was Peter's crying. There was a scene where after the seance with Charlie, Peter cries into his Dad's shoulders like a  baby and it was so bad. I just felt like it could have been done better. Everyone laughed in  my theater :\\",8pg2ma
e0ct5g4,Can we take a minute to appreciate how misleading the trailers are for this movie. They make it seem like Charlie is the main antagonist which makes it much more shocking when she dies about 40 min in. One of the few times a movie is made better by watching the trailer beforehand.  ,8pg2ma

e0dbomg,"Fun fact: the allergic reaction scene in this, right before Charlie says hi to the pole, was so realistic I had flashbacks to my first allergic reaction (my allergies didn't develop until I was 23 and came on suddenly, so it's still pretty recent in my mind). So I was completely unprepared for what would come next, and when it happened, it only heightened my fear just as that long, long shot of utter horror and despair lasted for so, so long.

You never see it. You see a quick flash, so you know what happened, but you never see it. You see Peter drive home. You see him go to bed. You see him lie there. You hear Annie go downstairs. You hear the scream. It gets louder. Still on Peter. It's the worst horror someone can imagine. And you never saw it. You can only imagine. The uncertainty is worse than finally seeing it. Then the scene ends, right when you crave catharsis, some kind of temporary relief. You've just been through a lot, you need to breathe.

No, fuck you, Hereditary says. Here's what you get instead: enjoy this shot of ants crawling on Charlie's decapitated, decomposing head.

God damn this movie. It was incredible. I hated every moment. I was in constant terror. I will never watch it again. It was excellent.",8pg2ma
e0dulmh,"Here is a theory I was discussing with some friends after we saw it last night. When Paimon chooses a host, he cannot jump to another host until the head of the previous host has been cut off.

A lot of these points don't make sense until the end of the movie:

-After the grandmothers funeral the family receives a call saying that the grave had been desecrated, at this point the grandmothers body had been remove, her head had been cut off (WE DON'T SEE THIS) and her body placed in the Attic.

-Once the grandmothers head was cut off Charlie was the next host, but Paimon was not happy with being in a body who had such  vulnerabilities, so the Cult of Paimon had Charlie eat cake at the party with nuts in it (I believe one of the girls making the cake can be seen in the last scene as part of the cult). They had not planned on Charlie's head being decapitated by the pole, but the pole DID have a symbol of their cult on it so they probably planned some kind of accident so Peter would not be able to get home on time and give her the epi pen. The cult probably had planned to dig up Charlie after her funeral, same as the grandmother, and cut her head off then to release Paimon. However, the pole decapitating Charlie worked just as well.

-When the mother is possessed, you can hear the Piano crash or break and she cuts her head off with the piano wire.  Once her body falls Paimon leaves that host and enters Peter a young male host.

I'm sure there are a lot of theories floating around but this one seemed to really fit.

They should've stayed with a more realistic portayal, cut the cult crap and choose another ending. I wouldn't even mind if they'd have said everything was just a psychosis because of PTSD.

e0b49c4,"Alright, I looked through the top comments in this thread and didn't see this particular theory, which is what I had thought immediately upon seeing it.  My friend who I saw it with claimed to not have noticed, but I feel strongly like this is a solid theory for the film.

It wasn't an occult film.  There was no cult.  The grandmother was schizo, and passed it on to the mother and son.  None of the occult stuff actually happened.  Annie burned Steve alive.  Peter murdered his mother and decapitated her.  Peter or Annie dug up the grandmother's body.  Joan never truly existed, or if she did she was only in the grandmother's photo album but all interactions with her Annie hallucinated.  All of the occult/supernatural stuff was either hallucinations or making connections that didn't exist that was brought on by mental illness.

Did anyone else think this?  I seriously believed this watching the whole movie.  That's why Steve never sensed Charlie in the living room \- only Annie and Peter did.  That's why none of the freaky shit started happening until Charlie died.  The combination of stress with the art gallery and losing the daughter brought on the schizophrenia in the mother.  She even admitted to having it and ""sleepwalking"" to the extent that she almost immolated her son.

It makes perfect sense, too, given the title of the movie \- Hereditary.  The mother passed her mental illnesses on to her daughter and grandson.  There was no cult.  She was just crazy.  She died, then when Charlie died Annie and Peter started going crazy, too.

This is by far the best movie I've seen in a very long time, and the best horror movie I've seen in theaters probably ever.  The acting was just top notch and was what drove the film; it was truly a horror film driven by the performances and not cheap jump scares or anything.  The most intense and nerve wracking scenes were entirely driven by the actors' performances.  I need to see it again to test this theory, but my god Toni Collette was astounding in this.",8pg2ma

In general this movie was very good but also very weird.

Up until like the last 3rd I felt lost, like the movie didn't know what it was. Was it a ghost movie? A weirdo movie? Was the mom just crazy? What was the light thing? The atmosphere and the scenes where really good and intense but it didn't make sense.

Then the last third clicked and all dort of made sense and I started making these connections and all eas very real and creepy and oh fuck Charlie Jesus sculpture was weird as was flying demon (i think possessed by grandma) mom.

I think up until the dad burned I was skeptical that the mom was crazy. I still got goosebump and all the scenes were good but I still thought it wasn't real but when the kid got up oh man. This movie was good.

Extra bit of fun/dread was having the servee at my theater bring me the fries just after the car accident scene...yup I ddint really eat them.

Toni Collette was so amazing in this movie, you could take out all of the supernatural parts and still have a haunting psychothriller, which I guess is why it works so well. I don't really buy the theory that it's supposed to be entirely a product of mental illness (mostly because Peter hasn't been exposed to the Paimon mythos by the end and would have no reason to hallucinate Joannie, either (although these could be different in the longer cut which I will absolutely watch), but it is an interesting interpretation nonetheless.",8pg2ma
e0ickrc,"I'm really interested in the words appearing throughout the film. The words on the wall are Satony, Zazas, and Liftoach Pandemonium. According to the Grimorium Verum (if you're interested in the Occult arts), Satony is recited during rituals where one is trying to connect with the dead. The timing for when Satony appears on the wall in the film is super interesting; it's a bit before when Joan strongly suggests that Annie should open herself to a seance. 

Zazas appears around the time things are getting a little weirder and uglier (which is ironic given that this is Hereditary where things are rarely the opposite of weird and ugly). According to occultist Aleister Crowley, Zazas (along with a few other words) is recited when evoking the demon, Choronzon, who is known for becoming a hurdle between oneself and enlightenment. Maybe this was a hint at Annie losing her mind rapidly.

Liftoach pandemonium is probably the most interesting, linguistically. Liftoach is Hebrew for ""opening"" or ""to unlock."" Pandemonium is, well, chaos. And the timing for this particular etching-in-the-wall is right before hell completely unleashes itself upon the family.

P.S. The words that Annie recites at night while trying to get in touch with Charlie contain ""rex"" and ""occidental."" Rex, as you already know, refers to ""reigning king."" Occultists *insist* you refer to Paimon as ""King Paimon."" Check out the Occult subreddit if you think I'm kidding.

My friend has a son who is deathly allergic to peanuts. It’s so bad that one time a kid who had been eating peanuts *breathed in his face* and he had to be rushed to the hospital.

So, my question is: if Charlie was so allergic to nuts, why didn’t they make sure there was an epipen nearby at all times? TWICE she’s at a gathering where food is being served, the second one the family has no control over (obviously at the funeral they could choose what was being served, but she still snuck in a candy bar they didn’t know about). 

You can blame the son for being irresponsible, but Annie knew that food could be at the party. She didn’t have the foresight to make sure they took an epipen just in case? It was clear how much Charlie’s death affected her, so it’s not like she was an uncaring Mom. ",8pg2ma

Some of my issues were the embroidered welcome mat conspiracy and scrapbook reveal--although it had the creepy ominous music--was kind of funny because it was almost TOO obvious.  I also thought the character of the father was meh.  This film seemed like it paid homage to some Roman Polanski films, which I appreciated because although that dude is a creep, he's made some creepy movies.  Probably because he IS a creep...

Why were no police involved in Charlie's death?

Is it possible to kill someone, yet if no one reports it, nothing happens? Surely at some point a teacher would notice Charlie wasn't in school for several days and call the parents?

e0bbgbj,"What a great horror film! I don't know what was better, the writing, the acting, or the cinematography. It all came together for an amazing film that is equal parts Rosemary's Baby and Jacob's Ladder. I love how Hereditary doesn't rely on jump scares. There is some visceral imagery in the film, some of it I can never unsee.

I feel like the ending is very subjective, to the point where I almost think my wife and I watched two different movies. She leans heavy into the supernatural/occult explanation of the events in the film. I disagree.

I think Annie and Peter were suffering from schizophrenia. Ellen, Charlie, and Annie's dead brother likely also had this *hereditary* (lol) disease.

Ellen and Joanie started/joined a cult based on their shared psychosis and the story of Paimon. Annie obviously aided this cult, which is how her mother's decapitated corpse ends up in the attic just as Steve said.

Annie and Peter witness numerous hallucinations throughout the film, in the form of ""nightmares"", ""sleepwalking"", floating orbs and apparitions. (maybe even roadkill?) Peter's early onset schizophrenia is induced by the traumatic death of Charlie and exacerbated by his pot smoking. Near the end Peter experiences complete dissociation and is inducted into the cult. Annie snaps and murders her husband the same way she once attempted to kill her children and herself, but I'm still not clear on what happens to her afterward. I thought I saw her (alive) bowing to Peter with the cultists in the treehouse.

Whether you believe the film was supernatural or psychotic in nature, I believe it is ambiguous enough to support both interpretations but I could be wrong.

Either way, Hereditary was one of my favorite horror movies in a long time.",8pg2ma
e0cqvg9,"Absolutely loved the movie. An interesting question is asked during the classroom lecture near the beginning. 

I don’t remember exactly which story they are discussing but the teacher asks is the demise any less tragic if you know the character had no choice or was doomed.

I think this is asking the audience, and hinting that the brother was always going to make that mistake, taking his sister to the party, and the post hitting her during the drive home. It was set in stone by the grandmother at some point with her rituals. Does it make it more or less tragic? I don’t know.

e0kn3lf,"I've been thinking about the movie since I saw it 4 days ago, but here's my thoughts on what happened. I don't think any of the supernatural occurrences actually happened.   I understand people will disagree and there are some holes in this theory, but hear me out:

If you think about the first and last shots of the movie, they're both Annie's diorama.  She clearly explains her family history if mental illness, and she resolves to bury herself in work after the death of her daughter.  Could it just be her unstable frame of mind trying to cope with the deaths of her mother and daughter, the underlying resentment against her son for killing her daughter, and her relationship with her husband falling apart?

Waking up to find your daughter's decapitated body would be enough to make anyone snap, and for someone who has a history with mental illness and has a creative nature seems likely that she would inject these ideas and themes into her work.

By the end of it, she decapitates herself, along with her mother and daughter.  It seems like a twisted way of trying to relate to them.  She spoke about how close that her daughter was with her mother, and uses that to be the same as they are.

She admits to attempting to light her son and daughter on fire.  Doesn't it make sense that she would also do the same to her own husband?  It makes sense that she is the one that's responsible for killing him instead of some magic spell on a sketchbook.

The final shot of her son, now a demon being crowned as pure evil is her final separation from him.  He became the embodiment of evil when he killed her daughter and refused to apologise, fess up, or even appear remorseful.

I'm not sure which is more disturbing: the coven of witches orchestrating everything in an elaborate black magic ritual or the family that falls into murder and suicide following the death of a daughter.

TL;DR - Annie lost her mind, digs up her mother's and daughter's graves, kills her husband and then herself, and dies imagining her son as the embodiment of pure evil after the death of her daughter at the hands of her son.",8pg2ma

e0z46b3,"What a complete mind-fuck of a movie. I don't think there was a single jump scare and some of the imagery was very creepy which makes it better than the vast majority of horror these days. The daughter dying so early into the movie was one of the more shocking things I've seen in quite awhile. The Charlie character was featured heavily in the marketing and the brother was in one or two shots in the trailers and it's completely flipped in the movie. The brother probably has the second largest amount of screen-time in the movie behind the mother. In fact I have to give huge props to the marketing team for not using the money shots in the trailer. I really had no fucking idea where this movie was going unlike a lot of other movies where I  can piece together story beats from a single trailer.

The first half was really well done and didn't even have much horror bits in it. I felt so much dread and sorrow for this family. It was one of the better movies I've seen in terms of characters dealing with grief and loss. The second half goes full on into the crazy demonic cult shit and it never lets off the gas and I fucking love it for that. I loved walking down the aisle after the movie ended and seeing people looking completely dumb funded and shocked at the shit they just seen.

I think my one complaint is the length. It felt like an eternity and I felt like there were way too many shots that went on for far too long, or a character hearing something behind them or feeling a presence in the room so they verrrrrry sloooowly turn to look at whatever it is.

e5lnyab,"I have become a little obsessed with this movie. I don't go for most horror but this is right up my alley. Real, creepy, supernatural horror that delves into your primal fears. I think this movie is brilliant.

My question is the house, the inside looked nothing like the outside. The house from the outside was not big enough to have those long corridors and so many rooms. Almost every room had one of those hutches ( which made the rooms look sort of like dollhouses)   and it seemed as if the rooms were out of proportion. A lot of the rooms looked like Annies replicas.  I thought that maybe the cult was manipulating the family and that is why the first scene is in the miniature house which actually has real people in it.  But now I am wondering if it was Annie all along. If this was all part of her mental illness and she was inventing this story using dolls and her replicas or maybe this was her work?? 

There is a quick weird thing towards the end of the movie where they show the outside of the house and it is dark outside but then you hear what almost sounds like a light switch being clicked on and it is suddenly  daylight outside. 

There was definitely something weird with the lighting. It wasn't clear weather it was day or night and the trees outside were lit up.  Very strange.",8pg2ma
e7lbpjd,"Did anyone happen to notice that the necklace that Annie is wearing at the funeral in some of the early scenes has the crest of Paimon?  It's hard to make out but I believe that it is.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

More subtlely, #4, Peter is smoking in his room and exhales smoke out the window at night.  We see him exhale the smoke from a vantagepoint outside away from the house and at the same time, a plume of cold exhaled breath comes from the dark from someone outside..",8pg2ma
e0bexdt,"I prefer the narrative that the supernatural and occult scenarios in the film actually were happening instead of being the effect of schizophrenia.

I thought the initial sleepwalking experiences weren't sleepwalking, but rather sporadic bouts of demonic influence or possession, especially after the seance scene. Whenever Annie burst in to a creepy rage, I just assumed it was the grandmother talking to Peter through Annie.

That 666 symbol of the cult was all over the entire movie. Annie had the same necklace as her mother with that symbol, and Charlie gazes at it when she sees her grandma at the funeral. You see it again with the pole at the car crash, on the door mats and the books, in Joanie's apartment, and of course, in the attic written in blood.

Everyone who asked Annie about Peter had me pegged as a cult member, meaning Joanie and the support group, basically any old person. When Peter saw the glowing light at the school, it looks like he looks at a teacher through the doorway, who then does the finger curl and tell him to come inside. Did we ever see what happened because of that?

There was a string floating around Charlie earlier in the movie, which she notices before she gets up and stands on her bed. Was there any notion of Paimon being like puppet master? I get the tributes to him through the dolls, which fits in with that theme of Annie's mother training her to be great at making dolls (oh shit double meaning???), but especially when Peter's hand shoots up in class, it seems like Paimon trying him out for a marionette test run. 

I was wondering also if there's any significance to Peter jumping out the window and Joanie's call that all of them stay in the house during the ritual. Did Peter jumping out the window cause Charlie to inhabit his body instead of Paimon, or was Paimon the one doing the cluck in Charlie's body in the first place?

Charlie's bird obsession had me guessing so much. There's a drawing of a birds head wearing a crown, same one that her head is wearing at the end. This makes me feel like she knew what was going to happen, and so she saw herself as a bird. There were birds in cages during the ritual in the treehouse at the end, so I'm guessing there's some symbolism going on there. Im thinking it might be attached to Paimon due to the bird hitting the window when she was in class, not doing her quiz.

Things I plan on looking out for during my 2nd viewing: 

people at the funeral smiling

Any signs of the cult 666 symbol at the party Peter goes to (especially considering that Charlie seemed to eat nuts earlier in the film without any problem).

Are the grey people at the end from the support group?",8pg2ma

I won't be in a rush to see this again, but I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. The visuals were a bit too much for me, especially towards the end. ",8pg2ma
e0deic6,"I feel like this movie was mostly about mental illness and I'm surprised to not see much talk about it. Am I way off?

In the grief counseling we hear about the family's history of mantal illness (schizophrenia, dissociative identity are two I remember). Annie mentions how difficult her mother was too several times (maybe a stretch to say it's mental illness but there's imagery that supports it later on). The miniatures that Annie paints could be representative of her dissociating from those scenes (her mother as she lays dying in her bedroom, the funeral, the car accident). There is a (debated) link between weed and early onset of schizophrenia. The movie made the weed usage blatant and frequent. The women of the family all end up decapitated (lost their minds). Peter slams his head against the desk. The dad, who seems to be the only rational one, cracks in the car on the way home at the end, and then we see him literally ""burnt out"" from dealing with his family going crazy all at once. I think the crazier scenes are just the viewpoint of various characters going through some sort of  psychotic break. Especially because at the end, the view xooms out and everything looks like a scene Annie might have created. 

The movie is pretty genious because there is so much other imagery/foreshadowing to support the cult plot line at first glance, but (as another poster points out) there's tons of loose ends/questions. So the viewer gets to feel a bit crazy trying to piece together a puzzle that isn't really there..",8pg2ma

e1wz21u,"A couple things I noticed during the movie.

1. One of the miniatures shows what appears to be a model of what I assumed to be Charlie being breast fed  by a figurine that looked like Ellen. This is a probably a mental reference of Anne’s to when she mentions that her mother insisted that she be the one who feed her.

2. I can’t remember if I imagined it or not, but I could swear that horns were playing in the final treehouse seen when Paimon inhabits Peter, I did some reading up on Paimon and its stated that he is depicted as being followed by a band of men playing horns/trumpets.

3. Charlie is traditionally a male name, while never mentioned, I would be that this comes from some doing of Ellen’s, being as Paimon desired a male form to inhabit, and Ellen wanted Charlie to be a boy.

4.  In the scene where Joan tells Anne about the seance,  I believe she says that everyone needs to be involved in the ritual for it to work, but later in the movie Anne has already conjured the spirit of Charlie before and gets both Steve and Peter involved, this seems like it could have been a nod that you don’t need everyone for it to work, but they likely had to be involved to be tied to the book.

Also, why did no one care about the spooky writing that would appear over their beds? Why did no one care that grandma was marking symbols on the floor of her room???",8pg2ma

e0efnym,"I was really in shock last night when the accident with Charlie happened, and I gasped 'cause I didn't see it coming, yet all of her scenes in the trailers were already shown and it all came to me in realization. And I smiled as I thought this was going to be another ""this girl is possesed"" kind of movie, and how it all turned out in a different way and was really in for the ride ahead. What started as a ""Kinda horror, but mostly a drama,"" became a full on drama after Charlie, and then it went full on horror movie within the last 30 minutes and I loved it. Maybe not many people will like the last 5 minutes of the film when they explain to you what actually happened, but there was no other way for it to end, specially if you've seen The Witch, a movie which had a very similar ending. 

That scene with the grandma's ghost or spirit or whatever at the beginning was so good and the old naked man laughing in the corner was so creepy, I actually wanted to turn away during that part. Also when Peter sees Charlie in his room and as she looks down, her head falls off and it's a basket ball, I was just really holding my breath for it and to see it brilliantly pay-off was such a delight. And of course that levitating of Annie in the final act.",8pg2ma
e0ej2s6,"What is the meaning behind the words carved into the wall?

By the way, I’ve seen comments about the nuts and cake. There were definitely nuts in the cake. ",8pg2ma
e0enl5f,"Ok so these are the things I've noticed and interpreted in the movie. The scene where the pages of the book are being flipped by the wind.. when it shows Peter's face in each drawing it shows him getting progressively more upset and his eyes are crossed out because for the demon to posses someone (Charlie aka Paimon needs his body as a vessel) they need to be very weak and vulnerable, in other words he needs to be broken down until he can't tell the difference with what's real or not anymore.

Also the accident with Charlie was not an accident. The mother has a history of sleepwalking where she has tried to kill her family, but she plays it off as if it wasn't actually her. That's the hereditary part she's inherited. At her core she recognizes these impulses that demand her to kill her family members in order to move the ritual along, but she suppresses it. The instance where she tells Peter to take Charlie to the party where there's obviously going to be drinking, is a lapse in her control, because once Charlie dies the story jumps off. The accident was necessary, there's no way it's a coincidence that Charlie just dies and these supernatural horrors start breaking the family apart.

Something I'm not sure about.. ok so the grandma, the lady who had a wake service at the beginning, she was a spirit in the house right? Her coffin got dug up, hence the claim we learn of later and the pictures sent to the husband's email. So her body is in the attic.. why? Does it serve as a bond that allows for a demonic summoning? She seems to be able to communicate with Charlie so I get the impression that she's a disembodied spirit meant to guide Charlie into her prepared vessel. Is it possible that she possessed Peter to mentally break him or was that just a random demon and not specifically her?

Another thing I don't get is why the husband burned. The mother was the last one to touch the book, she was the one that threw it into the fireplace after her husband hesitated to, so why did he burn? I thought maybe it was because he showed distrust in his wife, and that was perhaps a form of weakness, maybe even greater than the mother's breakdowns and then that allowed for some kind of possession, but still, I don't see the exact connection, I don't know the mechanics of that scene honestly.

Then one more thing lol, why did the demon who possessed the mother towards the end, chase Peter up into the attic? His body was for Charlie so why would they push him so far to the point where he jumped out the window? They really beat him up considering that the body would be for a King. 

This movie really really REALLY messed me up, I've never seen something like this that made me think so much. My favorite part was the technicality of the car scene where Charlie got decapitated. The way the camera slowly panned up to the window where her head would be and then back down was WOW. Plus, Ari Aster chose to just stay fixed on Peter's face as his mother screamed to the discovery of her dead daughter. Wig disintegrated. ",8pg2ma

Paimon isn't completely in control of her body. So he can't force her to kill herself. But he can influence her to do things that might get her killed.

One thing that stuck with me in this movie is that it almost always showed someone's reaction to something horrifying before the audience does. I'm also going to go ahead and post all the notes I took on my phone when I was getting worked into a frenzy during the climax.

Hereditary:
- showing reactions to things before showing things

- sudden transitions (day to night, being doused in paint thinner, waking up)

- unreliable protagonists

- King Paimon and connection with grandma/Joan

- Red light (top of light) is green at the end

- triangles: symbol of the cult, then proclaimed to be rejected by Joan

- Joan's mirrors: does Leigh appear in them in the split second after Annie moves away from the one she appeared in?

- strange words throughout house

- harp symbol: shown throughout film (including on a light pole when Peter and Charley are driving to the party, possibly the one that killed Charley later)

- decapitation as a motif (bird, Charley, Annie)

- light ""wave"" reoccurring as connection to supernatural 

- tongue clicking mark of Charley

- cult connection

- guilt versus grief 

- bowing position: important at the very end of the movie, Annie's body does it while initially grieving over Charley and at the end when Charley's decapitated head is at the altar/effigy

- Queen Leigh

- grooming: ""I was a tomboy too.""

- 8 kings of Hell

- Northwest

- male versus female body (Charley's mind/soul in Peter's body)

- rejection of trinity for Paimon

- burning of book initially harms Annie, but then kills the dad when burned again

- use of miniatures throughout: Annie's artwork, beginning of film, and at the very end. Significance?

- obituary at beginning

- was Charley's death arranged?

- Annie's family: father starved to death, brother hanged self, both blamed on mental illness 

- Annie's dream sequence features her and Peter doused in paint thinner, both catching on fire at the end of the dream, referring to Annie doing the same thing in real life while sleep walking to herself, Charley, and Peter. Later in the film, Steve, the only person not doused in paint thinner, burns Alice after Annie throws Charlie's book on the fire

- any possible connections to The Blackcoat's Daughter?",8pg2ma

e4wgqrk,"There was a scene in the movie where Paimon was shown in the book carrying 3 decapitated heads. I think there needs to be three offering/sacrifice before the full possession of Paimon can be completed. The grandmother held the demon during her lifetime, i think, which is why the cult was always shown around her. When she died, the demon needed a new body to possess, i think Charlie was the temporary vessel (she saw the weird lights too before she died)

Remember when the Grandma said to Charlie, ""I wish you were a boy""? It's because she knew that Paimon needed a male body, and she'd rather Charlie be the vessel instead of the sacrifice. But because Charlie was a girl, her fate was sealed - she was to be sacrificed to summon PAimon and her brother would be the final vessel.

e62cb55,"Finally got a chance to see this movie. I had read some mixed reviews but managed to avoid spoilers so I didn't know what to expect. Wanted to share a few thoughts and try to remain mostly spoiler free for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

The tone of the movie is still lingering with me about 2 days after watching it. I've gone back and re-watched some scenes, particularly the ending because the music is both beautiful and haunting and vibes well with the disturbing imagery. Far too many horror films lack a resounding cinematic experience in addition to the horror. This one nailed the ending for what could have easily just gone off-the-rails crazy. It was still crazy, but not in the usual way that horror films end where the evil is eradicated and all is well until the final jump scare.

The practical effects were disturbingly well done. So much care must have gone into making that smashed face look as realistic and horrific as possible.

The trailer did a good job concealing some of the major plot turns while still promoting the film. You really can't tell what this film is about from just watching the trailer. These thoughts don't have anything to do with the film itself but I wanted to point out how well the trailer teases the film.

Overall, it was a great movie and will likely creep you at the least. Like I said, the tone of the film is what I remember most so it might ruin someone's good mood if not watched at the right time.",8pg2ma

I get the feeling this movie will be super polarizing just based on how similar films (It Comes At Night and The VVitch were scrutinized for the same thing but it just ramped up everything that followed.

e0jlmbg,"So I’ve come up with a theory, which as of right now seems pretty solid, although it could be debunked based off of details in the movie I’m not remembering. I do not think that Charlie is a literal reincarnation of Paimon as a lot of people in this thread have interpreted, the way that it would be in most possession films, a la The Exorcist, but that they (Charlie) are the heir to the throne as the eighth king of hell, born of the Paimon lineage. I think that at the beginning of the film the Charlie that we see is a real thirteen year old girl, with her own consciousness, who is partially possessed by her grandmother, and not Paimon. Although it could be debated whether grandma is the one possessing her or Paimon, I think there is strong evidence that she was only partially possessed, in the scene in which she appears to be eating peanut M&Ms (which she should be allergic to: whoever is possessing Charlie is not allergic). The real Charlie is one who is allergic to peanuts. While she is eating the M&Ms, she is also working on the decapitated bird head effigy: I think that the creation of this effigy is meant to be a sign to Paimon, sent by the grandma, that everything is ready to transfer Charlie, who has been groomed by the grandmother, to a proper host body (Peter). I do not think that the real Charlie, the child, is in on the plan to have her beheaded, and that Grandma and Paimon purposely exploit her weaknesses (her love of chocolate leading her to consume nuts). 
I think that Charlie is essentially the heir of both Paimon and Grandma Ellen (in the final scene of the movie there is a photograph of grandma which refers to her as queen, suggesting that she is married to Paimon). Charlie now  inherits the the family name and takes on the former king Paimon’s power and responsibility, but is essentially just the consciousness of a thirteen year old child suddenly forced into the role by hereditary obligation. To me this justifies the speech which Joanie gives in the final scene which a lot of viewers seemed to take issue with for summarizing what has happened, but which I saw as Joanie needing to explain to Charlie/Paimon the role they have ascended (or descended) to. Joanie begins the speech by reassuring Charlie/Paimon that everything is okay as they observe the dead bodies of what they remember as their parents, in the tone of someone comforting a child rather than addressing the direct reincarnation of a thousands year old king of hell. I hope that this theory makes sense, I’d be interested to know what others think, if it holds up to scrutiny or not. As of right now, this makes the most sense to me in terms of fitting into the general theme of the film, that being the horrors of what we inherit from our parents. ",8pg2ma

e116pt2,"WHOA!!

I checked Reddit and I think I'm the only one who thinks that the whole story is a narrative of dissociative identity disorder that stems ritual abuse/trauma based mind control and mental splitting. Like I think some of the characters are all one person, representing phases of a person's memory who has survived ritual abuse. 

I think the levitating images of Annie are the astral projection images that people with dissociative identity disorder describe when they dissociate from a traumatic memory, leaving another personality to take the heat. 

So I think the house represents the brain, and I think the mom, the daughter, the boy Peter, and the granddaughter Charlie may all be one person. When Charlie dies it's because Peter, a strong personality, has ""killed off"" that part of the brain. The decapitations symbolize that personality's complete death of memory. 

I don't know if I'm off base or not and I am still super confused about so many elements, and want to see it again!! Loved it! 

I have a movie called STRANGE BEHAVIOR which is an 80's horror movie about mind control experiments performed at universities.  We should watch it sometime. Tangerine Dream did the soundtrack, and David Lynch TOTALLY RIPPED OFF some aesthetics and themes.

It did suffer a little bit due to the massive hype (per usual with these types of films) but it still managed to illicit some genuine chills (and almost even tears!) at several points in spite of that fact.

The acting definitely sent this home for me. Toni Collette was fantastic as always, but the scenes that really affected me most were when Peter started breaking down. The spirit conjuring scene where he went from eager participant to terrified and sobbing was really excellent and impacting. Likewise the scene in the classroom with the desk. When he locked himself in the attic after running from his mother and started apologizing and calling her mommy was heartbreaking as well. 

The use of the family dynamic was extremely effective in this film, and really chilled me more than the more supernatural or sterotypical horror images presented.

Really, I could go on about everything I loved about it but I really just want to mention that this movie will leave a lasting impression in my mind.

I had this incredibly horrific dream as a child that my grandmother, great aunt and mother weren’t themselves and that they meant me harm. When I say they weren’t themselves I mean, it was like someone else was wearing them. I only had the dream once and I was probably 5 or 6 years old but I still remember it very clearly. There was something very dark and almost demonic about it. Throughout my life I get like flashbacks of that dream, maybe something reminds me of their mannerisms in my dream or just like the feeling it invoked. Anyways, this film catered to that deep seeded childhood fear like no other film or novel I have ever experienced. The scene at the end when the mother is chasing peter up the stairs and into the attic and then bangs her head against the ceiling, covered me in goosebumps and I became nauseous. 

I am now a 29 year old man and I tossed and turned with nightmares all night last night.",8pg2ma

From a film making perspective, I really enjoyed the sound design. I suspect that they used subsonic sounds to amp up the intensity, which I enjoyed. 

Visually, I enjoyed the way they managed to make the whole film appear as if it occurred in a model/dollhouse. It was...subtle, as in the settings looked ""off"" but you couldn't quite place finger on it. Or I mean, it looked like a miniature, but I couldn't articulate WHY it looked like one. 

The few extremely graphic, detailed closeups were cool. It reminded me of the ""gruesome close-ups"" done in Ren & Stimpy, but obviously not in a humorous way. 

Plot-wise, it was not anything especially original or creative, but it was well done. I don't understand some of the confusion regarding the plot, as I found it easy to follow.

There's two parts in particular that I'm still trying to figure out the significance of :

They don't try to make it a mystery.  This movie is more like the Shining in that it doesn't really get going until the final 20 minutes; both the Shining and Hereditary give you hints that something is very, very wrong but we don't really fully understand the implications or the consequences until the final act.  In the Witch, the atmosphere and tenseness comes from knowing something horrifying is out there and that the family could be hit at any second.  In Hereditary/The Shining, the tenseness far more comes from unfolding of family drama coinciding with horror elements.

The little girls popping noise will haunt me like the crackling scream from the boy in The Grudge.
I'm also very glad that i saw this at the cinema because the one I went to did a good job with the sound. Sometimes when I heard that clucking sound I actually thought someone behind me was making that noise. There wasn't anyone behind me though... 
From the very start the music already creeped me out too.

Toni Colette was brilliant and must have been exhausted after filming this. The rest of the cast were good too but I really didn't think Alex Wolff did a convincing cry. Sounded so fake.

The film got scarier as it went but I think the best scene has got to be the drive home from the party.
We just follow Peter leave the car and walk up to his room and try to sleep in the same way the he would if he had damaged the car and was dreading the trouble he would be in. Except its so so much worse and you can see it in his face because he had inadvertently killed his little sister.

I was so fucking shocked that she died too. I only saw the trailer once weeks ago and couldn't tell from other promotional material she would be killed off. She kind of still was a  major character but I thought the actual actress was going to be in all the way. ",8pg2ma

e0qd903,"* A question and some thoughts - **during the credits, do the red letters spell anything out?** I saw it a second time and realized there's probably some message there (but didn't record them myself).
* As far as relying on ""cult/occult"" tropes, I thought this movie did an excellent job at providing a unique dynamic for those tropes to operate, to see them in a new light (for instance, the totally ecstatic ending! we're sort of left in awe/astonishment/terror at the sight of this incarnated god, put under its spell, and it's fucking cool - the soundtrack here really helped. Comparable to The Witch). 
* The ""mental illness"" readings certainly fit - but if we interpret everything as hallucinatory or as the result of psychosis (as if this were \*just\* the result of a few neurons misfiring), we miss a chance to participate in the magic, to go into the psychosis (which is appropriate for artistic products like this - I'm not suggesting we ought to entertain the experiences of actual psychotic folk)
* Annie & her sleepwalking: she cannot take responsibility for anything, and therefore blames her behavior (pouring paint thinner on her and her children) on sleepwalking - it's not me, it's my sleepwalking - I'd never do that. This, to me, signals that she in SOME sense knows that she's a part of this grand plot initiated by her mother - that she's a cog in this nightmarish machine that knows no end (or however the girl in class described the Greek drama - that subtext is obviously important). Her way out is to kill herself and her kids. She, on an unconscious level, knows that she only exists as a vessel by which to birth a male child (her mother attempted to incarnate Paimon to into her brother, and I sense that she only kept Annie so she could have another chance at incarnating Paimon into another body). She equally cannot accept that she would want to end the lives of herself and her children, to escape the tragedy, and so she blames it on sleepwalking. But does that mean she wasn't under a spell when she attempted to light herself and her kids on fire? What about when she tries to pull Peter's head off? Is that a part of a curse? They want a healthy male body - so if she was cursed when she sleepwalks, why would she attempt to pull Peter's head off? Did Peter die when he jumps out of the window? Ambiguities. 
* Annie's artworks as displaying ""neutral views"" - the entire film is framed as one of Annie's miniature works - we start the story as if we were inside her miniature houses, and it ends with the miniaturized scene in the treehouse. We know she presents these as though they presented the viewer with a ""neutral view"" - to such a point she thinks it ridiculous she ought to hide her work from Peter (who quite obviously would relive his trauma at the sight of his sister's death scene) - she's merely creating a neutral view. This is quite obviously her way of handling traumas - materializing them in such a way that her griefs are neutralized. Maybe she doesn't have to deal with them if she allows them to be manifested in a supposedly neutral way. Obviously, not a great way to cope. But, what's the connection between the entire film's framing as a miniature and this ""neutral view""? This sort of lends itself to a modernist, reflexive way of viewing the film as itself providing a neutral view of the events depicted, being the materialization of the author's traumas so as to neutralize them. I sort of disdain reflexivity/breaking the fourth wall type things but I don't know how else to make sense of the theme of miniaturizing. It's as if the movie is Annie's exhibition. ",8pg2ma

I loved trying to spot all the symbolic scribbling and drawings - triangles on the floor, the markings on the necklaces etc.

My favourite parts are definitely the way it was shot - the different day/night cuts (especially the one that was like a light switch being turned on).  The soundtrack was decent as well.

I specifically went to an art house theater to see it and avoid the screaming/talking, but I’m shocked that anyone could laugh during this movie! It would’ve pissed me off so much. I luckily had a pretty good theater experience and actually enjoyed glancing at other people’s faces. There were a few “*Oh shit*” whispers in the audience, mainly during the wall scene, but that was just kind of confirmation that everyone else was engrossed, too.

The fact Peter was stoned during the entire Charlie sequence off of supposedly ""really good weed"" really hit home with me.

I suppose my mind was playing tricks on me because when she left the car I asked my sister if mom was crying and she said she wasn't. Another time, I thought I was in cardiac arrest, but of course it was all in my head. Weed can do some weird shit to your perception.

He suffered a break in reality when he refused to cope with his responsibility in the death of his sister at which point all of the supernatural activities started.

e0gs9bm,"There were so many great elements of this movie. I went in with no real expectations except that it would be something weird and unnerving as per usual for the A24 films I’ve watched.

I think one of the best things about this film was the feeling of an unreliable narrator, once it slipped that Annie was a sleepwalker (and had tried to kill her kids once)—that moment it was revealed, changed everything for me. I stopped seeing the grandmother as the antagonist from beyond the grave, and started to look at Annie *much* differently. I’m still unsure if I “believe” what happened, actually happened, or if this occult theme was a way to explain away the dollhouse control Annie had over things, but refused to acknowledge. I really thought the first shot of this movie (zooming into the dollhouse) would be mirrored at the end—perhaps as some way to explain everything that happened. That nothing was real, that Annie, like everyone else in her family, suffered from hereditary (and severe) mental illness, and dollhouses/miniatures, were her coping mechanism, her reality—it would explain the “floating”, the random hand movement of Peter in the classroom and him slamming his head against the desk—that none of it was real, but instead, manufactured by someone else. I guess you could say that was the “occult”, or it could be the miniature maker who did it, but the occult makes it both scarier and in a way easier to accept—we are products of outside influences acting upon us, we aren’t really crazy/mad.

I know that doesn’t really explain everything. Annie’s mom and daughter, Charlie, obviously had a bond—seeing the miniature grandmother with her breast out as though to breastfeed baby Charlie was shocking and in a way expected and understood if the grandmother was truly as narcissistic as we are led to believe. In a way, I could see Annie having “snapped”  and killed Peter and her husband of her own accord though, without demonic possession. She failed to take accountability with anything, was weak-willed, and clearly needed to see a therapist—on top of the family history of mental illness. I think what makes this film so intriguing is being able to view and accept it honestly from various perspectives.

Overall it was a thrilling mix that held elements of The Bad Seed, The Exorcist, The Skeleton Key, and even The Babadook. Believing in a thing can make it true—but also being clinically insane and unstable can be the chosen truth as well.",8pg2ma

Steve's reaction was equally heartbreaking too; watching and observing his wife's spiral, the absolute, genuine *terror* in her voice and her eyes and her begging for help. She sounded crazy, but she *believed* everything she was saying. Steve reacted quickly how I'm sure most scared husbands would.

I can't get this movie out of my head! I guess my only nitpicks would be Annie perched on the ceiling and floating away was a bit of a cliche scare, and the headless body floating up the treehouse was preeeeetty terrible. Besides that....wow.

I hated almost every second of watching it, but it was a very good movie. I think it probably could have ended with the shot of Peter finding his dad, though (maybe with the closet guy).

The final 20 minutes or so strays into “Rosemary’s Baby” meets “Kill List” which, I liked, but left a lot of people there cold. 

In terms of how effective it is as a horror really depends on what troubles you.

e7op7zb,"Two things that are peculiar about this movie: 1) Decapitation, or the cutting off the head are the most brutal parts of the movie and was shown a few times, but why use decapitation specifically other than for the pure shock value?, and 2) Annie Graham is an artist who builds smaller miniature versions of everyday objects. In the first half hour, there is a quick photo of her art book titled ""Miniature Worlds"" by Annie Leigh, which must be her maiden name? Of all the artistic professions, why did the director have her profession be some kind of builder of smaller miniature worlds? And its probably a minor note, but why use her maiden name instead of her married last name of Graham?

For the first question, decapitation is the ultimate violent action and violation of a person's individuality. We all have the same body parts, more or less, so we have the same number of fingers, toes, lungs, eyes, and so on. But our face and our mind is our own unique possession, we would like to think we are the only ones that possess that exact face and head we see in the our mirrors everyday. In ancient times, during war, it was recorded that some would cut off the heads from the opponent they have just killed. Why do this? Its said that the severed head served as a token, or even just a souvenir of war or a way to intimidate others, and demonstrated the power of the person who won the battle. What better way to demonstrate your power than to possess the actual severed head of the person who was once alive and breathing just like you are? It is the same as possessing their soul, and you demonstrated as having the power of life and death over another living being. What is unclear is then why the grandmother, then Charlie, and finally Annie had their heads cut off? Is this a way of offering their souls as sacrifice to the Satanic King the cult is trying to resurrect? Recall though that the grandmother died and was buried, then the cult dug up the grave and apparently transported the grandmother to the attic. They apparently cut off the head there and the corpse was headless from that moment on. Then Charlie had that horrific car accident, which left the severed head out in the road, where it started to be consumed by ants, a horrific sight! Finally Annie, who was already possessed, cut off her own head with piano wire in one of the most disturbing scenes ever. Then on a minor side note, there was Charlie who cut off heads from the dead bird and places it on top of her toys. And in the final scene the cult followers placed Charlie's severed decaying head on top of the metal statue. Maybe the head of the grandmother was originally placed there, but removed because it decayed too much to be useful? The timing and nature of the decapitation is different in all three instances. Then again, maybe its nothing but analyzing too much into what is just a brutally violent act, designed to shock viewers.

For the second set of questions, my opinion is that Annie could have been any kind of artist and it would not affect the story line at all. She could have been a professional painter who painted scenes from her life and earned money from it, or a photographer, graphic designer, whatever. But her main skill is building smaller versions of worlds? Apparently these creations are to be displayed at some art gallery, where people would come and  look at these miniature worlds. Some other observant posters have stated that it is the cult who is controlling or manipulating this family, similar to how Annie controls and manipulates the smaller versions of the items she creates. There is a lot going on here if we assume that Annie's profession was chosen to be what it is because it has a more deeper hidden meaning? As for Annie using her maiden name, it seems this movie is focused on the female side of ""heredity"". Most daughters are similar or closer emotionally to their mothers than their fathers. Though it seems like there are more female cult members than male members? I don't think this means a lot, but maybe it was deliberate on the part of director to show mostly females involved in this cult. Feminism = Satanism? ",8pg2ma

For the most part I really liked it. I think they should've kept the cult thing more ambiguous. It seemed forced for such an sublime, ambiguous film, to explain something so irrelevant. This movie, in my opinion, is a mediocre horror script that was executed by a grand master. I'm not saying the script was bad, it was just by far the weakest part of the film. Every other choice this movie made was truly inspired, and I'll probably catch this one again before it leaves theaters to pick up what I missed. 

On reflection, I believe this film is about the toll taken on mental health by tradition and ideology. Annie is a woman forced to have children because of a family tradition. She loves her children out of instinct, but in reality she hates them and some part of her wants to kill them. I think you could also interpret events to say that deep down she wanted to kill them to protect them from their fate. The result of Annie's oppressive heritage is the literal immolation of the only person that ever enabled (her husband) and delivering that same trauma to the next generation, her own children, one of whom becomes becomes the centerpiece of a cult.

Charlie and later Annie both mirror the body in the attic when they are sleeping in the treehouse.

The dolls house in the hallway always has one bedroom light off, I couldn’t work out if that was Ellen’s room or not.

Both times I went the majority of my friends who went with me hated it. Yet still they went out discussing it and trying to work it all out. The second viewing confirmed to me that I love this film.  So pleased as well as the first time I saw it people were laughing and making so much noise, but the second time there were just a few nervous giggles so I really could just get into it. ",8pg2ma
e0g3jmc,I’m sorry but was i the only one deeply affected by the decapitation scene? Something about it. From the unexpected impact of Charlie’s head on the poll to the lingering pain on Alex wolffs face to the mothers crying to the shot of Charlie’s head. That entire scene was probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to watch in any form of media before. I literally almost threw up i had to leave the theater and the scene is still affecting me mentally days later. I actually was so upset by the scene that i had to leave the theater and I’ve never ever had to stop watching a piece of media before no matter how gross. I’m just confused how no one else is talking about this scene. Was anyone else affected by this like i was? I just think it’s weird that no one else on the internet is discussing how they were upset by this scene. I feel like i witnessed a different film or something from everyone else. Does anyone feel the way i do or am i just crazy??,8pg2ma
e0izz1g,"I’ve already commented here but I just want to know if anyone saw this movie with a terrible theater audience. Fuck. Motherfuckers were trying to avoid showing any weakness and letting the film get to them by laughing and being annoying the whole time. I SEE THROUGH YOU. Trying to impress your girl or friends by being a douchebag like that instead of letting a film do what it’s supposed to do to you. Assholes.

One scene where the mother was having the nightmare where she explained to the kid how she tried to have a miscarriage...it was this incredibly well acted, fucked up, dreadful scene, and one fuckbrain up front went “biiiiiiiiiiitch” trying to get a laugh. Dude fuck off. Nobody wants your “funny” commentary. Watch the movie. Then, during the end where the imagery gets really fucked up and the mom starts floating, the same dude starts laughing again ughghgh.

Then some bitch said “boo” when the credits started rolling. 

But these motherfuckers will applaud after Avengers 5 next year. ",8pg2ma

This movie was a fresh, raw, and so calculated. I haven’t put hands over my eyes in a movie since I was 9 years old.

Cinematography, lighting and by golly the sound design was impeccable. And the small little details placed through out blew me away after. Terrified with no jump scares too.

Alex Wolff was just phenomenal in the scene after the pole incident.  I felt so incredibly affected by his performance and the level of despair he was feeling in that moment was palpable.  Great performance by the entire cast.  The set design was beautiful and haunting.  I love horror movies and rarely have to look away, but when Annie sawed her own head off with the piano wire I had to block my view because I felt legitimately nauseated.

I still just feel the worst for Peter. I liked the whole cast, but I think Alex Wolff was fantastic in this and Peter was the character that I cared about the most, and I just wish he could've been helped.

At the end of movies like these, though, I always wonder, like what happens next? Does the cult go kill a bunch of people? Does Peter go back to school and pretend everything's normal? Do they just all become really rich and disappear? Like, okay, the cult has Paimon now, so...now what?",8pg2ma
e113p1p,"So the first and second acts to me felt like The Babadook. I legit thought that the supernatural stuff was going to turn into an allegory for grief in the same way that The Babadook was. I felt relief when it turned out to be more supernatural and I was significantly less scared. It was, somehow, easier to suspend my disbelief at that point. 

This was a phenomenal film but I cant help but think that it would have left a more lasting mark if it were the story of a family dealing with the deteriorating mental capacities that come with this unspeakable level of grief and loss. Once that idea was shut down by the events of the third act I was less uncomfortable. Like, demons arent real so this isnt scary. But grief induced psychosis? That shit is no joke.

I should also add that my original prediction being wrong didn't ruin the movie, I was surprised and entertained and this is a top 3 film for me this year. I just *thought* it was going in a different direction than it ended up going.",8pg2ma
e14gj1o,"Anyone else notice how the movie subtly hints that the family has some sort of mental illness? The Mum mentions at the grief meeting that her family all had mental illness (Mother had DID, Brother killed himself etc). Since the name of the movie is *Hereditary*, we assume something is being passed down- like mental illness. It explains why the Dad is relatively unaffected in the movie, unlike the 2 kids and the Mum- he's not related to the Mum's side of the family, so hasn't inherited any mental disorders.  

Also, the movie both begins and ends by zooming into/out from a model, which the Mom creates. This perhaps hints that the whole thing is in her head. While I don't think the movie WAS in someone's head it was a good way to open it up to the viewer's interpretation.",8pg2ma

I'm going to assume it was nervous laughter, because the crowd was polite — no chatting, no cell phone use, etc. But then someone sneezed after a dramatic moment about two thirds through the movie, and the whole theater busted. Better than a fart, I guess. 

Anyway, the movie. I liked that it took its time — it went a long way in building up a sense of dread. I was always asking myself ""okay, _what_ is going on?"" and I had no choice but to chew on each and every creepy thing. The crowd may have chuckled for two hours, but I was very uncomfortable coming home to a dark house. I was conditioned to expect some horror lurking motionless in the dark.

I had a couple stray thoughts:

Gabriel Byrne's performance, or maybe just his character, was oddly inexpressive, like he was barely there mentally.

And this is really unimportant: I found it odd that the dog was invisible for most of the movie. I don't know why that stuck out, but 90 minutes in I thought, ""Oh, that's right, they have a dog."" It was like they only had access to the dog for two days of shooting.",8pg2ma

The movie was scary for both believers and non believers. It's scary because of the paranormal but for those who don't believe in that, it's terrifying to see what your mind can conjure up and not knowing that it's not reality. 
While we were discussing the movie, I asked my boyfriend which is more terrifying: The paranormal or your mind betraying you? 
I still don't know the answer to that.


One thing that kind of bothers me is that at the end when Peter's body is taken over and he is in the tree house, one of the cult members (Joan?) says ""It's okay, Charlie. You are Paimon..."".

e0k79kd,"So much has already been said in the comments here that I agree with, so I'll just say this: 

I absolutely loved this film.  Horror might just be my favorite genre, and I don't know when I last saw a potential top ten favorite, but this is certainly it.  The psychological factors, the thrills, the boogeymen in the corner (the mom up in the corner of the room during the last scene in Peter's bedroom, and the camera NEVER drawing attention to it was absolutely terrifying) the nods to so many horror classics (but still feeling fresh), it just checks all of the boxes. 

The story wasn't too convoluted, I think it was fairly easy to follow along with what was going on through most of it, and the ending made sense, no BS twists.  

I loved the cast, the acting, the cinematography, the direction. 

There were only two real issues I had: 1) The trailer and 2) The last couple minutes.  

As far as the trailer goes, it just showed way too much.  I was waiting the entire time for the dad to catch fire, Peter to slam his head on the desk, for her to tell him she never wanted to be his mother, the dinner scene freakout and the tree house to catch fire (which oddly wasn't actually in the movie despite the 101 shots of the space heaters in there making you sure it was going to happen at any moment).  I didn't watch the trailer a ton, either, it just stuck with me like almost all other imagery in this film.  The trailer was also oddly misleading, which is OK, I guess, because it certainly made me think Charlie was in the entire thing and threw me for a loop when she died. 

The last few minutes of any horror movie, I kind of give a pass to. There's a strong tendency to tie too much up, or give a goofy, over\-complicated explanation for what's happening, and this one didn't really do that \*too\* badly, but it was there.  I was also a little disappointed/confused by Annie dying, since the note her mother wrote her seemed to indicate she would live, but perhaps her and her daughter as somehow reunited in this new hellish landscape they've created with their demon prince.  Who am I to say? 

9/10.  And so\-far favorite film of the year, I think. ",8pg2ma

Why didn't Peter just call an ambulance to come to the house for Charlie, instead of driving her to the hospital?

The movie is about grief and dealing with the emotions that come with death. It seems like the director left a few hidden subtle clues to leave the true events ambiguous.

- The whole tone of the movie changes after the Mom loses another family member, shattering her psyche
- The mom had a prior history of mental illness i.e. The dad sending an email to her psychologist.
- A lot of the characters made counter intuitive decisions, not calling the police, not seeking help. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
- The conversation at the dinner table was more the Mom's perspective, the dad didn't say much and the son only said what the Mom was already thinking.
- The mom didn't notice all those cult books until conveniently after all the spooky events started happening? All of a sudden there is this unknown mysterious past that she had access to this whole time but didn't think to look? She was making all this up.
- What was the point of including her past sleep walking attempts of murdering her children if not to layout the framework of the Mom's instability?

I think you can take the events of the movie at face value and say it's about a secret cult doing shady shit or it's really about a woman who can't cope with losing both her mother and her daughter in rapid succession. Either way this movie is a masterpiece. ",8pg2ma

e22jivq,"My interpretation of the movie, which seems to be different from the director's:

Schizophrenia runs in the family. Annie shows some symptoms, Charlie shows some with the bird's head, Peter is relatively stable. Seeing / somewhat causing Charlie's death causes Peter's mental collapse. Any supernatural effects during the seances are due to their hallucinations. 

Joan is a well-meaning woman she meets at group. The seance in the apartment was a hallucination on Annie's part. She rented out the apartment and later became obsessed with the occult and with harming Peter, desperate to find some meaning in Charlie's death.

When Annie sees her photographs of Joan with her grandmother, this is her mental illness making connections that aren't there. She either sees the actual Joan with the face of the woman that knew her grandmother, or sees the pictures with the face of the Joan that she knows.

Annie kills Steven and herself. Peter completely loses it after seeing evidence of this, and loses control of his hallucinations in the treehouse.

One thing I liked about the movie is that this reading (hereditary mental health issues cause the chaos in the film) is at least partially supported, along with the cult or supernatural/demonic readings. I wish that the ending provided more meaning than the freakout/batshit /demon king thing. The movie forced me and the audience to cope with the death of a child and the fallout in a family; I think we deserve more than ""oh yeah he goes crazy and it's demons.""",8pg2ma

e0b9wh2,"Just got back from watching this film, and it was really good. Toni Collette needs all the awards. And the directing was incredible.

So, how many of you think that there are multiple valid interpretations of the ending? The more I think about it, the more I think the ""real"" story is that Annie and Peter were both legitimately going crazy after the death of Charlie (remember the history of schizophrenia in the family, and Annie's apparent penchant for sleepwalking and nearly killing people...). Plus, there are SO MANY allusions to dollhouses - the cinematography makes it seem like they are in a dollhouse, and the abrupt day/night transitions are like someone is flipping a light switch. And of course, Charlie makes all her weird little dolls, and at the end her head is on a literal large doll body thing. The dollhouse stuff is showing that their reality isn't what it seems.

Anyway, maybe Annie and Peter really did just lose their shit. Annie killed Steve by burning him up, Peter lost it and hallucinated all the culty shit. 

I don't know. I'm just wondering what the deeper meaning is here, because the Satanic stuff just seemed so out of place and odd. The film really is about mental health. Anyone have any thoughts about this?",8pg2ma

There were many elements I did like - the acting, the visuals, the slow burning tension build - but I was a bit disappointed in the overall end product. Mind you, I tend to prefer horror movies that are more grounded in real world terror as opposed to occult/religious horror, which never seems to draw me in as much. So I really liked the first bit of the movie, where it seemed possible the film was going to explore the psychological​ breakdown a family goes through after a trauma, and how this trauma might trigger the emergence of mental health issues in both the mother and Peter (which there is family history of, alluding to the ""hereditary"" title). Even right up to the end of the film, I was waiting for there to be a final reveal that Peter had had a mental break following the trauma of accidentally killing his sister, and ended up killing his parents, and the police find him hallucinating the final scene with all his ""followers"" and he's actually alone in the treehouse with the corpses of his family, and he's ranting about him being a King of Hell. To me, that would have been scarier, because that shit actually happens in the world. Or if the movie had a more ambiguous ending so you weren't sure if what you just saw was the results of weird occult stuff or a psychological breakdown.... To me, that would have been a more creepy, and satisfying ending than what we got. Like I said, I think I'm in the minority here, and I really did like elements of the film - I just wish the end result added up to more.",8pg2ma
e0ghyph,"So I am kind of late to this thread but I feel like chiming in.

This film was far better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a damn good film because of A24's recent track record). I'm not sure about anybody else but I was really thrown off when Charlie was killed towards the beginning; I felt like in the trailers she was kind of being shown as the protagonist, but she dies in the front half of the film and in a gruesome manner. When that happened my expectations were shattered and I was on edge the whole time since anything could happen after that, nothing was really off the table- the trailers did a really good job of advertising the film enough to get your attention but also not too much so as not to spoil anything. 

This, in my opinion, is better than The Witch (which was also a very good film). It gives you the same sickly feeling in your stomach, like you're disgusted at yourself for what you just watched, whilst also delivering on almost every other front; cinematography, design, acting and accurately portraying the impact of mental health. 

The cinematography was simply gorgeous - shots were perfectly framed and used Tilt-shift to its advantage to match the aesthetic of the model houses that Annie was creating. The way they never showed Charlie's body when she died in the car was very effective, it was left to your imagination as to what it looked like. 

The acting was on point and Toni Collette stood out in particular to me, especially upon Charlie's death and the discovery of her body in the car; you could feel the pain just through the screams alone. 



My only gripe was the ending - it was a little confusing (such as Steve being burned alive rather than Annie when she threw the book in the fireplace, who put Grandma's body in the attic? Who exactly took over Peters body, Charlie or King Paimon?) although it could be argued that it was left ambiguous for a reason. If you're a fan of artistic film, horrors, or you're just looking for a film to watch I would highly recommend this.

Plus the ""twist"" was so predictable that it was a bit annoying watching things unravel so slowly, like c'mon we all know that Ann Dowd is a bad guy. And then the movie just ends. Like is the message that people with genetic mental illness should either kill their children to save them from suffering or that people with mental illness shouldn't be allowed to have kids?

e0uqfku,"(#spoiler) Overall, this was a phenomenal debut from Ari Aster. I was thrilled to see a horror film that was also a family drama with Oscar worthy performances from both Toni Collette and Alex Wolff.  And the artistic choices were off the charts, from the meta dollhouse themes that run throughout, to the Oscar-worthy sound design that makes you feel like you're IN THE FILM YOURSELF to the groundbreaking score. . .it's just. . .definitely not what I was expecting in the best possible way.  Two minor quibbles:
1.  Annie's headless body floating up to the tree house in the last scene.  Totally unnecessary to the plot and just looked. . .fake as f.  The cult members could have carried it up there or something. 
2. The dog.  Totally superfluous to the story and also didn't need to be there.  In fact, it took me out of the story when thinking why, if grandma's rotting headless body has been up in the attic the entire time, the dog, or any dog, wouldn't have been howling like crazy.
3.  Was Paimon in Grandma before she died, and the cult had to cut her head off to release him so he could enter Charlie?  Or was Charlie Paimon the whole time?  If she was Paimon from before birth, why would they need to cut off the grandmother's head at all?  To my mind, it would make more sense, from the information the film gives us, that Paimon would have to possess three consecutive human hosts before the ritual is complete, and he is locked into his final human form.  I couldn't quite figure that part out.  Annie did say that her mother suffered from severe DID at the end, plus dementia, so this could have been Paimon manifesting somehow.  I don't know though . . .

On the whole, I think the issue of mental illness in the family was both a brilliant red herring, while at the same time the idea of a demonic being shadowing a family for generations is a perfect metaphor for mental illness.  ""The noonday demon"" was actually a colloquial term for mental illness, specifically catatonic Schizophrenia, in the Middle Ages, and obviously people with psychotic disorders were believed to be possessed by common folk not too long before the advent of psychiatric medicine, so there is a connection.

Overall, what I found most disturbing was not anything shown (although Charlie's rotting severed head did make my stomach turn for sure), but the implications of the story itself.  In Rosemary's Baby, a lackluster actor sells his soul (and his wife's body, unbenknownst to her) to Satan just to secure some measly part in a Broadway show.  Which is definitely disturbing as hell.  But in this, a mother, the most revered figure in family life, offers up first her husband, then her own son, to a demon in exchange for earthly wealth and power.  When that doesn't take, (presumably the father and son both knew, consciously or not, what she was doing, and killed themselves before Paimon could enter either of them), Ellen offers up her daughter, her son in law, and two grandchildren for the same goal.  ""Our sacrifices will pale next to the rewards"" she tells Annie in her posthumous letter, which, well, my god.  I can't imagine a greater betrayal than that.  Your own mother, your own grandmother, giving you to a demon for, what?  Money?  Power?  That was the most horrific thing to me.

I found it interesting that, of all the gasp-worthy moments in the film, the one that elicited the strongest response, both times I saw it, was the sleepwalking scene where Annie tells Peter she didn't want to conceive him, and tried everything she could to abort him, ""but nothing worked"".  I think that goes back to the theme of ultimate betrayal here.  There's nothing on earth more primal than your connection to your mother, and to have the being that brought you into this world, the person whose body you entered this world through, tell you she never wanted you, well.  . .the idea seemed to really resonate with people on a gut level.  It was a packed house, and I wonder how many of them thought, in the very edge of their conscious selves, whether their own mothers had ever had similar thoughts.  A truly shocking scene that didn't need any jump scares to make people gasp.

Lastly, and I wondered this to at the end of The Witch, but what the heck did the coven think was going to happen once they successfully summoned Paimon into Peter?  Like, it would be one thing if Paimon was an old god from another pantheon and we weren't dealing with a Christian universe here, but Joan explicitly states that ""we reject the Trinity, and pray devoutly to you, Great Paimon"".  The statue in the tree-house with Charlie's head had it's right hand point downward, two fingers out, in mocking negation of the classic Byzantine icon of Jesus with his hand raised before him, and the crown functioned as a sort of halo.  The bodies of Ellen and Annie before the statue, then Peter, also seem to signify a demonic inversion of the Trinity.  This all but states that we are in a Christian universe and Paimon is not an ancient god, but a demon, one of the fallen angels, and that Ellen's group are not cultists but a coven of witches.  Like in The Witch, every member of the coven must explicitly reject the Christian God and embrace Satan or one of his agents.  Thus, these people are, in effect, worshiping a demon. 

 Which makes them all fucking idiots.  Paimon doesn't give a shit about them, their wishes, or helping them in any way.  He's a fucking demon.  He has their souls now, so they're all fucked.  Meaning, one way ticket to the lake of fire down in hell.  At best, he'll be like "" thanks for the help dudes, kthxbai"".  At worst, he'll break all their necks with a snap of his fingers and go out to conquer the planet. Or something.  I don't know.  I just think people celebrating the ending, just like the people celebrating the end of The Witch (Thomasin is free now, yay!) aren't getting it.  Thomasin signed her soul over to Satan.  She's fucked at the end of that movie.  All of the cultists, who, one assumes, did the same thing in this movie are similarly delusional and fucked.  The only winner here is Paimon, who managed to con easily duped humanity into helping him enter the world, and nothing good will come to any of these people.  So. . .go Paimon?  At least he got what he wanted in the end. . .",8pg2ma

e0nbs5p,"Maybe I haven’t scrolled through this thread enough, but I really enjoyed the inference that everything might have just been in their heads. Annie and Peter are just mentally ill. This makes the movie scary for me. I’m not a fan of the demonic possession/satanic ritual scary films, so when you look at everything that happened as Annie and Peter’s interpretation of things through their mental illness it’s much terrifying in my opinion. 

 Annie has DID (Dissociative identity disorder= multiple personality disorder) and likely schizophrenia, and Peter has early onset schizophrenia caused by trauma (from the death of Charlie). Because both of those diseases are... [Hereditary.](https://youtu.be/F8mYLi3PGOc#t=0m02s) 

When Annie first goes to the “Losing a Loved One” meeting she mentions how her mother had DID and dementia, and her brother had schizophrenia and he killed himself thinking his mom was “putting people inside of him.” So you know from then on you know that she could possibly have any of those, and the same for Peter and Charlie. 

Maybe she just internalized her brother blaming her mother, and her strained relationship with her mother because she talked her into keeping the baby (Peter) led to a delusion that her mother is evil. 

Annie’s sleepwalking was never really sleep walking. It was the part of her that despised her children because she wasn’t ready to be a mom, taking control of her consciousness. 

No one besides Annie ever met Joanie, and whenever they talked no one was around at all besides in the background and peripherals. Similar to John Nash in a beautiful mind with his delusional interactions. 

Before Steve received the call regarding Peter’s broken nose, there’s clearly an open email stating he thinks Annie is on the verge of a massive psychotic breakdown. 

I saw a late showing so my thoughts aren’t as put together as they were when I started typing because I’m tired, but overall I really enjoyed watching the film and liked it even more thinking of it as if they were just mentally ill, and nothing was what it seemed. 

And I haven’t had a scary movie give me the chills like this one did in years.

Edit: Also, why did nothing ever happen to Peter’s eyes?!",8pg2ma
e11amma,"Unpopular opinion but I would have liked it more if the supernatural stuff was not made clear. All the movie up until the husband gets bbq'd we were not sure if what Peter or Anne were seeing was real as their family had a history with mental disease, hence the name hereditary, and it was very well done setting the ground for an unreliable narrator. However once the horror is confirmed to be supernatural I think the movie losses some value. Something similar to the shining were we are left with ambiguity whether it was supernatural or mental disease would have been a lot better and would have fitted better with the first half of the movie. 7/10 overall.",8pg2ma

e69g6rt,"The first half of this film creates and sustains a gut-twisting dread out of a very terrestrial circumstance, but pretty much the moment Joan's son visited from the dead I felt it was headed downhill. Personally, I'd like to see a version of this film that features Joan (and maybe Annie) as an objectively nutty grieving mother trying to dump her agony into something she can convince herself to believe. I felt like Annie's contorted cries at the sight of her daughter's corpse, paired with the frame of Charlie's ant-ridden head, set this film in motion to be a brutal real-life horror honing in on the dissolution of a nuclear family through severe trauma. It could have implemented characters like Joan along the way to cement the nightmare that is losing a family member, especially in the way Annie was forced to confront it.

Instead, we're given spirits corrupting bodies and forcing them to climb around on walls, self-harm and conveniently trip up while trying to murder their children, a la *The Babadook* and *Oculus.* Throw in some domestic demonic enthusiasm and evil spirits brewing just under the surface a la *House of the Devil*, *Antichrist*, *The Ritual* and *The Conjuring*. Not to mention the kids these days seem to be into the naked old people horror and drawn-out shots of a mediocre young adult actor pretending to be disturbed to his core as per *It Follows* and *It Comes At Night.* It truly did feel like a freshman outing in its paint-by-numbers execution of so many plot threads, themes and visuals throughout its third act in particular**. A24 seems to occasionally tread on the very-safe formula with its horror films.

The final ten-odd minutes of the film are utterly silly, and frankly, I am convinced the film was shot and edited explicitly for comedic intent right around the 1-hour 56-minute mark. While Annie sawing away at her neck starts out relatively unsettling, the clear nature of the puppetry is given away by her eyelids in the close-up shot. It explodes into a gut-buster of a moment as the pace of her sawing picks up erratically with cartoonishly frenetic and unrealistic movement. Peter's terrified stare is cut off by a group of random naked people waving at him, to which he responds with a Simpsons-esque jump out a third-story window, accompanied with a delayed downward pan to his pancaked body reminiscent of a Wright film (or something). All the scene needs is to replace the weird ""ding"" sound that cuts off the violent music with a classic record scratch, and people would be praising this as a revolutionary horror-comedy. Don't even get me started on framing essentially the entire final scene as a close-up on this dumbass pos kid's best Ryan Gosling impression. A solid thematic foundation of deep-rooted trauma and ugly honesty is curdled to sate a cocky new director's hunger for faux art house cred.",8pg2ma

The only thing that still confuses me is why Charlie is in Peter's body in the end, as if her and Paimon are a weird package deal or something; shouldn't Paimon be the only one in the body? I don't buy that Paimon was in control of Charlie since birth or something, because Charlie looked pretty confused at the end and I would think that Paimon would know what was going on and would be happy to finally have the male body he wanted. I thought maybe something went wrong and Charlie jumped in instead of Paimon, like when she possessed her mother during the seance. The clicking did make it seem like she was hanging around after her death; could there have been two blue lights, first Paimon lurking then Charlie?

- Some people are wondering how the mom's body got up in the attic. I think the door to the grandma's room having been opened but Annie/Steve both didn't do it implies a cult member had broken in earlier and done that already
- A shot I liked a lot is the disorienting one where the camera is upside down as Annie walks through the hall (pre-possessed) because it seems like a typical artistic shot. Except, later, she actually is upside down chasing her son, I think in the same hallway. It's foreshadowing in such a creative way.

Definitely gonna need a second watch after this, but far out this movie really got under my skin. Had no idea what to think about it when I first walked out of the theatre, but the more it stays in my mind the more I realise the heavy impact it had on me. 

Was much, much slower than I anticipated but I loved that because it really made me care about Annie through her family history. Made Charlie's gruesome death much more of a gut punch in my opinion.

The film reminded me of Rosemary's Baby at the end, but this is one of the most uniquely directed and stylised horror movie I've seen in quite some time, and definitely one that I won't be forgetting.

What I love about this movie is that it relies more on drama, atmosphere, and shocking imageries than jump scares. As someone with two younger siblings, the scene where Charlie accidentally decapitated almost traumatized me.

**Question:**  Did anyone catch on to a greater meaning with the miniatures?  I kept thinking there would be a causal connection between the models and what was happening in real life.  Some of the shots seemed to be of models masquerading as real life (the opening shot being most obvious, but also when Charlie's spirit was turning pages and drawing pictures).  I was convinced the light that flashed and followed characters throughout the movie was related.  It reminded me of someone with a magnifying glass manipulating light.  It seemed to me like someone was doing that to the models and affecting real life.  I tried to see if any of the models could be directly impacting or causing other events in the movie (i.e. if Annie was working on a school when Peter beat hisself up *at* school), but that wasn't the case, it looked like she was working on a funeral home when that happened.  When she re\-created the car accident, even though it was obviously after the event occurred, I thought they were setting up her models as being more than just a reflection of what has happened in the past.

e0cowqw,"First of all, this was the best horror movie I've seen in ages. I immediately watched Aster's short films after trying to figure out how A24 have him 10 million. 

Even though Ari has explicitly stated that demonic possession and cults are the primary culprit, and the film is from the point of view of ""sacrifice lambs"" (the family), I think it's all a metaphor for mental illness. 

Aster seamlessly plays along themes of mental illness and the occult. From my knowledge of Schizophrenia, I know that it is heriditary, that it starts around late adolescence, and it can be triggered by trauma and psychoactive drugs (includes marijuana). Aster nails the subtle symptoms of Schizophrenia: the ""apparitions"", the distorted light, the voices (clicking noise). The most apparent symptom is the delusions of grandeur. A person with schizophrenia can function like anyone else but can be thoroughly convinced of grandiose theories, like the government watching them, being an alien conduit, being a manifestation of a demon. 

While there are moments where the supernatural is apparent (the father witnessing the seance), I thoroughly believe this film is about Peter's descent intro heriditary schizophrenia and how his brain processes grandiose delusions into something plausible.",8pg2ma
e0tjskw,"A few thoughts/questions now that I've had a night to mull over the movie:

1. Annie knew (perhaps subconsciously) that Peter would eventually be used for a force of evil. Hence why she tried to have a miscarriage and tried to kill him while ""sleep-walking.""
2. Although I'm not sure whether Joan ever really had kids or not, my guess would be that she wished Paimon would take over her son or grandson's bodies if they ever did exist. Although, maybe she doesn't have the right heritage that Paimon likes?
3. What's so special about Graham family that makes them the chosen ones?
4. Why wasn't Joan at Annie's mother's funeral?
5. Why would Paimon (in Charlie's body) be stupid enough to eat chocolate cake with nuts in it. I mean, he's a Hell King!, show some intellect for heaven's sake! Unless it was a super-elaborate plot to decapitate her?
6. Where did Paimon go directly after charlie was killed?
7. And lastly, why does Paimon eat chocolate bars like a goddamn psycho?

e172lh8,"First of all, I thought the house they used for the exterior shots was really nice.

As for the movie, it had me right up until the end. I though this movie did a fantastic job building tension and showing the grief and dynamics of the family. I figured that the whole thing was going to be Annie and Peter having psychotic episodes. As I understand it, Peter is of the age when schizophrenia begins to manifest and, based on Annie at the support group, it runs in his family. But, Okay everybody was actually being manipulated by Annie's Mother and her cult who are trying to summon a demon to possess Peter. Fine. It was still a great film, right up until the moment that Steve was set on fire. After that, in my opinion, it just became a generic horror movie. There was no reason to have Annie flying around and crawling on the ceiling and walls. It was just so cheesy. I really feel that the last bit brought this movie down from really great to just good.",8pg2ma
e0b0a6y,"I was captivated throughout. The movie just reeks of its own atmosphere from the get go. Unlike other horror films where the tension rises and then its snap back to reality until the next thing happens, this movie is just plain weird and wrong from the beginning. Definitely need some time to digest it all but im already picking up on some themes and ideas upon reflection. Upset with how the trailer presented the film. Toni Was easily the best and the son did an amazing job. Did NOT expect the daughter to die so early. This movie is just so grim. A few tropes and overused scare/creep tactics that im tired of but overall a very thought provoking movie. Movie was not scary at all. Go see this movie!!",8pg2ma
e0b0zew,"The craft into this film was incredible. The acting, the writing, the set design. and especially the camera work. I loved how almost every shot was in motion, until it wanted you to focus on the horror on screen. How the longer the movie went on, the walls disappeared and the camera made you feel as if looking into a diorama (another nod to masterful set design). The atmosphere and dread were so real, and despite having to pee for almost an hour, I couldn’t look away because every scene held its own weight and purpose. Not a scene wasted, the slow burn never felt boring. 

The one thing I can say I didn’t care for was the very last scene/mythology behind the movie. It felt a little silly after all the intense and serious family crises. Especially the last scene, which after that damn foreboding treehouse, the whole movie, lead to a scene that felt way too exposition-y and more awkward than terrifying. Too bad too, since the movie was on such a uphill climb until the final moments (Annie using the piano string is one of the most horrifying things I’ve ever seen). I find endings the hardest thing for a movie to stick, and that goes tenfold for horror, and this didn’t quite make the landing for me.  


It’s too bad too, because I do like the implications it has in the movie and character motivations looking back. The foreshadowing was also excellent, as was the story telling in general. The way the backstory was inserted over time slowly, and how looking back explains Ellen’s motivations (“my brother killed himself because he said my mom put voices into his head”).  How subconsciously she probably knew what her children were, and in her sleep tried to set them on fire. 

All in all, one of the best made horror films I’ve ever seen, and quite the thrill ride, even if you have to look past the semi clumsy ending. My favorite film so far this year, by a lot.

The entire sequence with Charlie and Peter going to and from the party might be one of the best uses of suspense I’ve ever seen on screen.  The entire theatre was filled with dread.  Even the Stoners behind my row shut up after that. A star is born with Alex Wolff. Kid put on an acting clinic. Shout out to Colin Stetson for the score. Absolutely beautiful. Even the cinematography I felt could get an Oscar nod. And did anybody else appreciate that the trailer didn’t give away much at all?

e0gwyo4,"Just came back from watching it with a few church-going friends and had a long discussion breaking down the not-so-obvious religious tropes:&nbsp;


&nbsp;* Peter's name: Matthew 16:18 ""And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church."" So crazy how Peter's the one to physically survive it all because he was designed to be the final host this round and be a new start for Paimon.&nbsp;


&nbsp;* Joan's name: the feminine form of the name John, and because of her role as guiding Annie into first seances and being the one to crown the head of Peter when Paimon has fully possessed him, we concluded she's meant to represent John the Baptist and not John the disciple. His sole purpose on earth was to prepare the way for the Messiah.&nbsp;


&nbsp;* Peter's similarities with Jesus. He was born by a normal person for a greater purpose. So unexpected how he turned out to be the main character to go through the most pain and trauma - mirroring the trials and crucifixion of Jesus. And when Peter finally dies (crucified), he ascends to the treehouse and is crowned a king of Hell, Satan's right hand man. It's the inverse version of the Apostles Creed, which states: ""He(Jesus) ascended into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of God. From there He shall come to judge the living and the dead."" And that entire final scene in that treehouse gave major Christmas manger vibes as well. &nbsp;

Nevertheless, it was still F’d up enough that I enjoyed hearing a theater full of people react to it. I took a couple edibles beforehand, so I screamed a little when it showed Charles’ head. That beautifully awful scene alone, from the start of the allergic reaction to that gruesome punctuation mark, justified the cost of admission. What horrifying dramatic irony, hearing Anne cheerfully head off to work and anticipating the sound she’ll make when she discovers what remains in the backseat.

I have some issues with the story [there is a moment toward the end where, i think it's joan is talking to peter after he was possessed and said that the cult corrected the king of hell's female form to give him a male body. I understand that Charlie was mistakenly born with the demon inside her when it was supposed to be peter. My question is how did the cult manage to orchestrate Charlie's killing to rectify that fact. SO many things have to go right for them to kill charlie in the way they apparently did. Did they steal Peter's friends phone text him about a party and just hope Peter is pressured by his mom to bring charlie? Also when they get to the party I guess they are hoping Peter is irresponsible and doesn't bring an epipen and also doesn't check to make sure the food is safe to eat because he is distracted by trying to get laid? I could believe that they left something in the road for Peter to swerve away from but were they hoping that charlie would stick her head out the window at that exact moment and get killed? it seems like a lot of very specific things need to go right in order for this plan to work or did they just get lucky that this happened](#spoiler) I still enjoyed this movie overall I think, but the ending was a bit underwhelming.

I don't believe this was the scariest movie but engaging and thought provoking. It definitely gives you a sense of learning with the family presented and puts you in the middle of the strained relationships to really embed that feeling of 'somethings not right'. This movie was an absolute slow burn with certain scenes painting great/amazing emotional pictures (car scene, Joanies apartment, family dinner). Though I can't help but feel that the over all theme and reason for climax of the movie was almost just swept in there. There are small things here and there that riddle throughout to convey a sense of ""something always there"" but with the material that they were shoeing in and trying to meld together I felt just didn't cross the finish line for me. The content that the movie is based upon is kind of difficult to interpret/wrap your head around because it's multiple books about things we're all familiar with but a different spin. Long story short, when i got to the climax and looking back I was only wishing that it was handled possibly a little differently or set as an even creepier tone.

One thing I still cannot seem to wrap my head around is the use of the miniatures... What was their purpose, other than to look unsettling? 

My idea of the movie, before seeing it (and I made sure to avoid spoilers), was that the miniatures were going to play a huge part of the supernatural element. I was very disappointed to not see them used to the extent that I thought they'd be. Somehow the family would be trapped inside a miniature as a result of the grandmother's cultish haunting, or something along those lines. 

There was even that very strange house monument where there looked to be two houses buried underneath another one, which stood on top of a grassy lawn. I thought for sure this would play into SOMETHING. It was definitely one of the more creepy miniatures in the house.

What if Annie set Steve on fire, rather than a result of putting the book in the fire?

Annie brings Steve downstairs, and she puts lighter fluid on the book, telling him to burn it which results in his hesitation and eventual demise. However, when Peter comes down later, Steve's dead body is directly next to the fireplace, rather than across the room where he was shown burning in front of Annie. Could it be a possibility that Annie actually burned Steve to death by herself, rather than it being by a supernatural book?

Beyond reading Stephen King I'm not big into horror so I'm glad this wasn't a  formulaic tale with a predictable third act and denouement.

I disagree that the husband was a useless character (didn't Gabriel Byrne portray the devil in a movie once?) in that the story needed to sacrifice the one grounded and rational character in order to ratchet up the climax before explaining it away (sorta ) in the last scene. 

Loved Toni Collette's performance. I went from seeing her as a victim to wondering if she was actually psychotic like her dad and brother to seeing her as a victim again with her amnesiac sleep walks being induced by Queen Mamma's witchy machinations.

Also, it seems these people are really worshipping Satan, and we’re able to use the power to craft such and elaborate death for Charlie, it seems like they would have had the power to make Charlie a boy from the beginning so they wouldn’t have to go through the trouble of getting her into Peter. Also, when Charlie is transported into Peter, it seems like she’s still a sort-of-disabled preteen.

Was the mother(Annie) being controlled son some level in the beginning of the film?

Charlies decapitation was obviously premeditated; the pigeon head, the mark on the telephone pole, etc., but Charlie going to the party isn't.
Annie seems to be the one to force Peter to take Charlie to the party, not Charlie insisting. It seems that, if the decapitation was all part of the plan, then too much would have been left to chance?

The only explanation I could think of is that Annie was controlled somehow, possibly by the symbol necklace, which I can only assume the mother gave it to her.

-

Also I loved the anti-Trinity symbolism at the end, and I can only assume it was intentional. 

3 decapitated sacrifices represent the anti-trinity (Father, Son, Holy Ghost): The Mother (Grandma), The Daughter (Annie) and the Holy Ghost (The possessed Charlie).

Make of these however you will buy these are just some details I’ve noticed. ",8pg2ma
e15niqj,"Okay, so if you look up Paimon you can see that his symbol ([https://www.fromoldbooks.org/Mathers-Goetia/pages/009-Seal-of-Paimon/009-Seal-of-Paimon-q100-500x503.jpg](https://www.fromoldbooks.org/Mathers-Goetia/pages/009-Seal-of-Paimon/009-Seal-of-Paimon-q100-500x503.jpg)) is the same as the one that is used in the movie on Annie's and Ellen's necklaces and as a general symbol for the cult. 

BUT in the movie they altered the symbol so that instead of the four little person-like figures at the top of the symbol, there's only three (I couldn't find a good photo of this, but you can check it in the trailer, it's definitely only three).

e0eq9am,"Trying to wrap my head around the plot, would love to hear people's input.

Paimon needs chaos and vulnerability to attain more power, and effectively and absolutely take control of a host.

The cult was eager to facilitate this but due to Ellen's dementia and strained relationship with Annie it was difficult to take the simple route of directly going for Peter. Annie subconsciously suspected Ellen of wrongdoing due to her brother's eventual insanity, which is why she sheltered Peter from Ellen. Subconsciously she attempted to miscarry Peter because she didn't want him to suffer the same fate as her brother. She continued to subconsciously attempt to kill him out of love - she didn't want Ellen getting her hands on him.

For some reason, maybe partly because Charlie was a girl and not feeling any danger, Annie relented and allowed Ellen to become close with her daughter. 

Ellen, along with the cult, hatches a plan to create chaos and destruction in the family so that they all become vulnerable. This begins with Ellen's death, making Charlie depressed as she just lost someone she was very close with. Charlie being down and wanting to reunite with Ellen, becomes vulnerable to Paimon's powers. I suspect that Charlie is coerced in on the cult's plan to be decapitated, and is imagining her own fate when decapitating the bird.

Due to careful planning by the cult and a bit of Paimon's (continually growing stronger) supernatural powers, Charlie's decapitation occurs. 

Peter, Steve and Annie are weakened by this, and the cult and Paimon (feeding off their vulnerability), slowly continue to manipulate them to create further disruption within the family.

Annie never wanted to admit that her mother was capable of what she was doing even though deep down inside her the signs were all there - books in the attic, secrecy, brother's insanity, cult's symbol on Joan's welcome mat etc. Once she does consciously connect the dots she thinks she might be able to save Peter by burning Charlie's notepad.

Steve seeing all this destruction is pushed over the edge when he perceives that his wife has become insane. This vulnerability in Steve gives Paimon the power to burn him alive. 

Annie seeing Steve's death allows Paimon full control of her.

Annnnnd likewise, seeing his dad's death and mum's insanity make's Peter fully vulnerable for Paimon to take over his preferred male host and instill Charlie's mind that has been groomed to accommodate Paimon's ambitions. 

Someone noted that Paimon had three decapitated heads in his picture which I assume means that everything that happened went exactly according to the demon king's plan. Maybe he could have done things a bit more simpler but due to loving chaos he chose to have fun with the family first - Just like Annie's craft, the family was a set of objects that could be designed and manipulated as the demon king pleased. There then being a deeper meaning to the name Hereditary - the family's fate is not an elected condition, but something that is passed down to them and out of of their control.

-Why was Ellens head removed?

-Why did it seem as though Charlie needed to die for the events to pan out according to plan? At the end they said something about ""correcting the first body"" or something, which I'm assuming means they killed off the female host (Charlie) so Paimon could inhabit the son? But why? Charlie just seemed to be creepy for creepy's sake? I mean autistic yes, but strange behavior and look was why? I'm assuming Ellen treated Charlie as her ""favorite"" because Paimon was inside her, but why would Paimon have ever entered Charlie to begin with? Why wouldn't he just enter the son instead?

I'll post more questions as I remember them, but honestly, I think this movie is lifted by its production quality and creepiness, I think the actual substance is all over the place and doesn't really seem to make a ton of sense. A bunch of seemingly kind of random shit happening to make you think they're gonna zig when in fact they zag in a completely random direction. I was definitely expecting more.

When Annie travels to a store (a setting outside of the home and the school) the store is called Joanne’s or Joan’s I believe, and then we see Joanie in the parking lot. Also we see people able to manipulate space, walking on the ceiling, when Annie is at Joanie’s apartment the camera is flipped to make it appear any is on the ceiling.

e0teld7,"Absolutely loved this film - as someone who isn't a huge fan of horror usually, the reviews and hype convinced me to go see it, and I wasn't disappointed, especially cause the moderate number of horror flicks I have seen I very much enjoyed as well (The Babadook being the scariest I'd seen until this).   


There is one thing that puzzles me though, even if it might be a bit nitpick-y: Obviously the plan for Charlie to die was there from the beginning, since the demon needs a male host rather than female, but what I don't understand is: if the cult planned to kill her, in the car, with that pole, in that way, which would justify us seeing the demon's sigil on the pole later, how did they manage to swing that series of events? Making Peter hallucinate the roadkill and causing him to swerve the car? Seems a bit far fetched?   


And if they didn't plan to kill Charlie in that way with that pole, what was the point in showing us the sigil on the pole at all? Maybe to show us that the cult is far reaching and pervasive in the local area (maybe it's on *all* the telephone poles in the area)? Anyone who has any thoughts, I'd like to hear them :) ",8pg2ma

It's the fact that the plot is one you can relate with that makes it so scary, turning the supernatural elements almost believable.

e0uamh4,"Well, I enjoyed it! Tense and creepy, no over-reliance on jump scares.

My bug bears with it:

- I just personally felt the horror went out of the ending but this is likely a matter of taste. I guess demons and cults don't scare me but I just kind of thought: 'meh' I think I would have liked it to be less complicated an explanation, really, and I expected that the film would be about something hereditary - passed through the family - so I was hoping for a reveal about the grandmother that I didn't really feel I got. We heard all about DID, schizophrenia etc. in the beginning. I would have liked the reveal to have been a link to that rather than demons, unless I was supposed to assume that the whole family had demons inside them?

- I get why the director/writer chose to have the distant relationship between Annie and Peter but I feel he had to sacrifice emotional effect for this. It would have been even better if there was more 'glue' between them - a complicated but intense/enmeshed relationship rather than the mutual distrust you see between them which had the effect of making them feel very separate. It would have heightened the ending somehow as well, when you hear him say 'Mommy' and when she's become possessed, if you had that feeling that he loved her intensely but was now faced with her having changed.

- The father character was underwritten. He felt like he was just there to service the plot and could have done with more of a personality of his own.",8pg2ma

e0dkh6y,"What a great film, started off pretty decent then it just kept getting better and better. The lack of jump scares was definitely a highlight as it just relied on atmosphere and disturbing imagery to be creepy not necessarily too scary, in a good way since it really did focus on the family drama at the forefront. It perfectly saves the incredibly fucked up shit and scariness until the end. 

The lack of exposition was also great, at no point did the film slam its breaks to explain the plot or the cult or anything like that. They perfectly showed the photo albums the right way so people could figure it out for themselves with all the other information we've learned to put all the pieces together.

 The cinematography was my favorite part overall i think, almost every shot was interesting and moved the camera around in creative ways at the right time and i never got bored of looking at it. How the film started with the miniature houses and zoomed into Peter's bedroom really impressed me at the start, then blew me away when the last shot zoomed out of the Tree-house and looked like the miniatures again matching up with that what they did for the opening shot. The film went from like a 7, to an 8 then a 9 by the end for me. I had no idea where any of it was going, cant wait to see it again. ",8pg2ma

He uses beautiful, slow long takes to draw out so much tension and dread.

e0ftyz6,"I posed this question before and no one responded so I’ll just ask again.  Is it possible that the entire plot of the film was just the showcase that Toni Collette’s character was making throughout the entirety of the movie?  Some of her recreations were eerily similar to the events taking place throughout the movie- for example why would she ever recreate Charlie’s death in such a gruesome way and just laugh it off when her husband tells her to not liked Peter see it?  Also, the way the camera zooms out at the end of the film almost is like we’re watching a play- It looks like a cross section of the model houses she’s been making.  The way the film begins too, it’s like the characters are in the model houses.  I’m really not sure if this was what the director was intending, but that was my immediate opinion of what he was trying to coney- that none of the events truly happened and it was all the storyline of her showcase.  Let me know what you think.  ",8pg2ma

e0h1hnw,"Been seeing a lot of complaints about audience ruining the movies, so I thought I'd give a couple rule of thumbs, to better ensure an optimum viewing experience

1) Try going to the earliest showing as possible. Younger folks tend to sleep in during summer break, so there's probably less chance of them going to an early showing.

2) Avoid going to mainstream chains like AMC/Regal, as the more ""casual"" moviegoers/kids tend to flock there

3) Go to any of the fancy, ""premium"", ""21\+"" theaters (i.e. Alamo Drafthouse or Cinebarre). Higher barrier of entry not just for teenagers. Also, people who go there tend to be more die\-hard and want the best cinema experience (and are willing to pay more), so they probably won't go out of their way to be obnoxious. 

Not exactly foolproof, since obviously the best way is to wait until you buy/rent it, but you should have less of a chance of having a shitty movie experience. ",8pg2ma

e0stpe5,"I absolutely loved this movie. I’ve been hearing comparisons to being a modern day The Exorcist but I felt it embodied The Shining, those long panning shots and sense of dread the entire time, what a rush. I was panicked for two hours.

I had the pleasure of seeing it early in the day, with one or two people in the theater, all engaged and quiet. I think that’s essential viewing for this film, movie crowds are insufferable these days; I’m sure under different circumstances it wouldn’t have affected me so much. The whole cultist/demon thing took me a minute to digest but what I took home with me on the drive home was just the sheer emotional levity of this film. It’s tragic, and the supernatural elements only added to how utterly doomed this family was. 

The imagery and tension was enough to contemplate leaving the theater multiple times during my experience, and that only deepened how much I appreciate it, seldom does a movie terrify me to the point of nope-ing right out of there. This tops my horror list.",8pg2ma

Question - if anyone has a theory - why does Annie chase Peter at the end?  Is it to get him into the attic and if so why?  Is it for some other reason?

My wife made the comment during the film that Annie seemed to finish the piece fairly quickly. Although we don't have a good gauge on how much time had passed, it definitely made me think. Perhaps Annie was subconsciously making some of those sets in order for the action to take place (Peter having almost having his head town off).

Also, something that really struck me about this film was just how uncomfortable I felt the entire time. Even before I realised Joan was a cultist, her body language and manipulative behaviour really bothered me. When she is talking to Annie in the parking lot and she constantly grabs her arms and turns her towards her in this erratic and over the top manner...creepy",8pg2ma

Was the fact that  Paimon was a male demon trapped in a little girls body the reason that he was trapped and seemingly unaware?

I did feel like it went a bit more traditional horror in the second half, and I was loving what the movie was doing, the craftsmanship was amazing, but I was still reeling from the trauma of the first half to really take in everything in the second half. The image of her flying up to the treehouse/temple at the end was so eerie and cool. I definitely feel like I need a rewatch to really appreciate it properly, but I think this is pretty close to a perfect horror film, even if I wasn't really scared so much as disturbed.",8pg2ma
e58be7h,"I liked it a great deal, and legitimately felt frightened and stressed out through the whole thing.

That said, the whole Paemon/hell/seance/cultist stuff just doesn't resonate with me - probably because I'm not a traditional connoisseur of the genre and have only recently started to appreciate recent horror films.

To me, horror is ultimately about contemplating your deepest, darkest fears, facing them in the art form, and walking away with some sort of deeper understanding of those fears.  Which is why growing up a lot of traditional horror flicks dealing with exorcisms and ghosts and the devil and hell didn't really affect me, because I never believed in those things even a little.

But there are some horror movies that really do resonate with things I'm afraid of, either in a real way (Funny Games, The Invitation) or in a symbolic way (It Follows, Get Out), or at least play with the formula in a meta way (Cabin in the Woods, the first couple seasons of AHS) and Heredity for sure felt like it was going to resonate with me - what deeper fear is there than your entire family dying with no one being left behind?

At the very beginning, we learn that Annie's father died from starvation caused by depression, and later her older brother died from suicide, and blamed their mother.  Later on the film, we're teased by the idea that Annie has some resentment for her son for some reason, that her own mother had a close hand in raising the children even though she wasn't close to her daughter, and Annie has always had issues with sleepwalking and doesn't understand or remember covering her son with paint thinner and lighting a match.  In fact she even resents her son and husband for remembering the incident.  

To me, there's just so much terrifying shit right here, all on its own without the occult. The threads of mental illness following between generations, the emotional seclusion and isolation of the family (there's a reason they didn't bother showing conversations with police, doctors, teachers, counselors, etc, even though those conversations presumably took place), patterns of emotional abuse, and just all the darkness festering beneath the surface.  

While we're focused on Annie's journey and grief and mental state, her husband is on the edges, quietly dealing with the same exact tragedy, with the added burden of trying to protect his son from Annie's actions.  I felt a palpable tension in his scenes as he quietly and discreetly dealt with that pain, waiting for him to break and die like Annie's father did.  And watching Peter deal with his guilt and self hate and isolation, and waiting to see if his mental state would get so bad he would eventually break and harm himself like Annie's brother did.

Anyway, the whole family died and nothing was left behind, which is pretty much the worst and deepest fear for many of us. But this whole occult/hell/spirits occupying bodies stuff just isn't scary to me, and in fact just makes everything markedly *less* disturbing.  

It almost feels like a copout - like, ""eh nevermind it was just demons all along and those don't exist so I don't have to be scared.""  That's what I took away from the ending, and I think it would have been much better and frightening and more meaningful if it was in the realm of cycles of mental illness and emotional abuse and the emotional isolation of the family.  Also as the old adage goes - why be afraid of the dead when it makes more sense to be afraid of the living?",8pg2ma
e0b0sg3,"Just want to express my love for this movie again. Toni Collette is fantastic beyond words and deserves all of the awards available for her performance. Truly though, she was amazing. A shame horror movies usually always get overlooked for those types of things. 

This a horror film that is driven by plot and the true exploration and fleshing out of characters, something most modern horror movies fail to explore. This is not a film for anybody who is expecting a cheap scare every five minutes but if you're willing to allow yourself to become immersed with the story, you'll love it. Toni Collette is just so engaging. The themes of loss and trauma are things we can all relate to as humans and there's a lot of symbolism that really managed to speak to me personally, about the manifestation of certain things inside of us. Beautifully directed, while this technique is a slow burn I felt a sinister tone from the very first moment. The tension continues to build and once it really picks up it becomes unrelenting. The ending is terrifying because of how expertly those  moments of terror are crafted but also because you do become attached to the family so once everything goes to hell (literally), it elicits quite an emotional response.

(Grandmother's body in attic.) Did Joan dig it up or did Annie? Is Joan really involved in the cult possessing the family and doing rituals, while at the same time, Annie is just insane by the end? This movie has a kind of unreliable narrative because one of the main characters (Annie) is insane by the end. She even mentions she almost killed Charli and Peter by covering them in paint thinner, and mental illness clearly runs in the family.



Also, side note, when the blue electronic looking waves fly over people, that's when they're being possessed right? I'm 99% sure of this but only started putting it together at the end, and I'm definitely gonna rewatch this movie later.

I didn’t expect the father to die in that way though. definitely thought either annie or peter would kill him. i noticed early on that charlie’s head wasn’t in the frame anymore with either the accident model or just as a jump scare. This movie made me want to vomit and shower and call my mom all at the same time. ",8pg2ma

The idea is that the demon was inhabiting Charlie’s body, thus orchestrating her own death so that she could eventually move on to Peter. (Am I right or wrong?)

If right, is the idea that she purposely ate the nuts and stuck her head out the window knowing she would become decapitated? 

If “yes”, I get that she seemed to eats nuts despite knowing she’s allergic, but wouldn’t there be a simpler way for the demon to kill themselves (aka Charlie? Is the answer “yes”, but this way is just more fucked up and a part of a beheading ritual?

This may be too far down the rabbit hole, but did anyone else think the whole town was in on it and not just the support group?

There is even a shot of Peter looking at other students who don't react and there are kids in the shot in front of Joan in-between them. I don't think that was done by accident... could it be the entire town including the school was in on it?




It would also explain the high school party where they bake a cake with nuts in it... that seemed odd if they weren't trying to kill Charlie. Charlie has to die prematurely to move into Peter bcz the king wanted a male host.

1) why did the grandma have to be beheaded and brought into the attic? Was it just the symbolism, since she was queen, that she had to have her head cut off due to tradition/rituals? 

2) what exactly happens in the seance scene with Annie, Peter and Steven? Like, when supposedly Charlie's spirit goes into Annie, and Annie starts saying things like ""Mommy why is everyone scared? Mommy what's happening?"" or whatever. Steven splashes Annie with water and Annie seemingly is knocked out of it. Wtf happened there? We know that Paimon enters Annie right after Steven immolates... right? So what was with that moment right after they summon Charlie? 

3) confused about the apparition of the grandma in the first act. Was that misdirection? Annie's imagination?

Ok just one more:  it looks like Peter's school is the same setting for Annie's therapy group.  We see this because we get an overhead shot when Peter is alone with his milk and chicken.

eag7gdd,"Finally watched. I liked it. If you catch onto the hints, you will figure out quickly, but there is a lot of red herrings thrown in to throw you off and thats smart.

How much you like this movie depends on your taste for horror or movies in general. Horror and fear is subjective. This is a character piece with themes in what the title says, Hereditary. The horror in the movie just reinforces those themes. Which is wonderful in my eyes. 

I found it to be scary honestly, because everything felt so real. Thanks to the phenomenal acting. Haven't been scared by a movie in years.

I do think the last act is...conflicting to me. I felt if it was more ambiguous then clear cut I would of loved that. Is it mental illness or a demon? clearly is was a demon but I would of loved if they would of let it to interpretation.  ",8pg2ma
e0h0jxv,"So this might be unpopular but here is my take. I thought the movie had a great slow burn lead up to something amazing, like Exorcist, rosemary's Baby, Babadook, but the final act just really tanked it for me. Let me explain. The movie I feel sets up the Schizophrenia aspect beautifully, hinting throughout the movie, nice and subtle. I thought the cult aspect was pretty heavy handed right off the bat. All the people she didn't know at the funeral, Joanie as a whole, the give away of Joanie's floor mat wasn't like a huge red flag?!!?! As the movie went on I thought a lot of the stuff was going on in Annie's head, but then also going on in Peter's head. The distress of accidentally killing Charlie and the loss of Annie's mother just had something break inside them both, triggering the family schizophrenia. Then we are left with not one, but two unreliable narrators. I read about what Ari Aster said about the film being about family trauma, etc. but I feel the ending just totally undercuts all of that. It felt like, ""oh you think that this is about a demon thing, but really its in their heads... just kidding it's a demon."" Anyway, Steve's plea for Annie to get help and then he catches fire, I just imagined Annie just set him on fire and imagined it her way. Then battled Peter in his delusions, and Peter cut off her head but not knowing it. All the cult members in the house and smiling felt really bland horror tactic. The payoffs felt unrewarding, for a plot that felt very connected the entire time. What was the meaning behind the piano wire? The miniatures felt like there wasn't a purpose. There was so much subtlety that the ending felt really clunky to me, like it didn't belong in that movie. It was stock creepy things in my opinion. I was really really hoping that the end would just have a split second of all the people that were bowing to Peter just be gone and see the reality of Peter just having killed part of his family and the insanity taking over. The actual hell king ending to me took away the emotional core of the movie and to me will be put into the heap of horror movies that almost were classics.",8pg2ma

THEN, when you see him glaring back at himself you start to think ""holy shit wait, that line...that's what she means"" so good. ",8pg2ma
e0uo77j,"I think I get one of the key messages of the movie.

I saw it with a friend of mine, and she was so disturbed and in shock 
I found myself digging for some kind of meaning after we'd left the
theatre.

And then it hit me.
The last scene, with the close shot of Charlie/Paimon's face, so lost and confused made me realize that this is a film about family, and more specifically the pressure family members can put on one another to be whatever it is they think the other one should.

The grandmother, the matriarch is again and again brought up as the 
puppetmaster, manipulating her daughter into having a child she doesn't want, and then immediately manipulating that child to make it what she wants to be. The scene wherein it's revealed she wanted Charlie to 'be a boy' is something seen in many many cultures when a girl is born and was one of the first things that really tipped me off. Really I think the ritual was a metaphor for the shaping done on a young child from the moment it's born into a family that doesn't appreciate it for what it is.

This is something I see all the time in real life, and it's just as horrible.
Of course, there's so much in this film to do with grief and mental illness, but I do think that that was the overarching theme.
And to make it even more grounded, why did the grandmother go through with this decade long plan?
For 'endless wealth.' This is almost exactly like a situation you would find in real life, such as families pressuring their sons to be athletes or doctors or what have you.

I found the film highly disturbing, and some of it left me very shaken but I am thankful for this message I was able to draw out of it.",8pg2ma

It also preyed on my fears of being watched. Like are there satanic cult people watching me right now?

​

Anywho reading a bunch of theories and things confirmed by the director himself I pretty much understand the movie because it's a lot to take in. I mean I understood it on first watch but there were still some things I needed help on. So I was reading that it's confirmed Charlie was Paimon since birth. If so was Charlie ever in control of her own body? Was she ever really Anne's daughter? Did they share a conscious because if not, what was ever stopping Charlie from just killing herself and making it seem like an accident a lot sooner? If she was always Paimon why was she ever so surprised with her visions or seeing the cult members stalk her?  Why did the cult need to set up such an elaborate & convoluted ruse with the school party, the son, the chocolate cake with walnuts, putting the dead deer in the road and getting hit her to hit her head on that pole. Was Charlie really in on it the whole time? Did her/Paimon gasp for air at that moment because they knew the pole was coming? If so why look so surprised? The cult couldn't have anticipated that she was gonna gasp for air out the window at that exact moment before the pole if  Paimon wasn't in complete control. Chock it up to just plot contrivance? Or were Charlie and Paimon both in control and in that moment when he knew the pole was coming that was his decision to stick her head out of the window and most of the time Paimon is dormant? But if not why such an elaborate ruse to plot her death? Paimon could have gotten her killed many times before if he was always in control of her body, right? Was it so Peter had to feel responsible for the death and make him more vulnerable to possession? Was that the key to making him vulnerable because I think no matter how Charlie died the mother would have been easily manipulated into saying the demonic chants in the house anyway.  That's the only part of the movie I still don't get it. If it's confirmed Paimon was in her since birth how did the control of her body work. Who was really in charge? They had to have shared control with Paimon have trouble controlling the body at all times. Can he not fully control a female host like he can with a male? Anyone care to elaborate?

Like she could pick and choose when it affected her, or rather Paimon did? I swore there was a crunching sound coming from that first Hershey bar, so I assumed it had almonds, but nothing happened to her. The second candy bar had a similar crunch sound to it. Then later it looked like she was eating peanut M&Ms off her desk when she was crafting her creepy dolls. They seemed too large to be regular M&Ms. Am I trying too hard to look for something or should I just accept that nothing actually had nuts until the cake?

e0hx1yo,"So, I generally liked this movie, but there's something nagging at me that I just can't shake. If I'm understanding the film correctly, the following two things are both true:

1. Ellen and the death cult were playing a very intricate and methodical long game, which we saw play out over the course of the film, with the goal of getting Paimon to inhabit Peter's body.

2. Paimon/Ellen/the death cult have nebulously defined supernatural powers that allow them to bring their plan to fruition (e.g., engineering all of the chance events that lead to Charlie's death, making the dad burst into flames when he throws the book into the fire, somehow getting Annie to teleport inside the attic when she was locked outside moments earlier, etc). 

The problem I have is that if the death cult/Paimon/Ellen/Joan have such crazy powerful abilities, why bother engineering such a complex scheme to get Paimon to inhabit Peter?  Their powers are never clearly defined, and at no point do we see the limits to them. We do know that they're able to make the dad burst into flames, however, and that they're able to bring about Charlie's death (the cult's logo is seen on the pole that beheads her) in a somewhat incredible manner. 

So if the cult and Paimon are so powerful, why bother with 90% of the plot machinations? Why not just kill Charlie and Peter before the movie begins so Paimon can inhabit Peter? Maybe there are some internal rules to how the cult or Paimon operate that would prohibit this — but we're never told about such rules, and as depicted it looks like Paimon and the cult can pretty much pull the strings however they see fit. 

I still like the movie. It was very effective and captivating and the craft was top-notch all around. But I also can't help feel that it ultimately renders itself redundant. ",8pg2ma

I recommended it to my horror junky friends but I don't think they'll be as scared by the end as I was. Still, I'll be sleeping with the lights on for a while.

One thing that i don’t see mentioned here that i just realized was that when Peter has the hallucination of Joan and she’s “expelling” him and telling him to leave the house, i totally thought it was one of those ghost warnings saying “Yo fool, it’s the house.

e0dhojt,"One of the things I loved about the movie is how much the director misleads the audience who think they can predict where things are going.

1) Charlie says ""Who's going to take care of me when you die?"" to her mom which is an odd question and we think it will come into play later.  Annie suggests Charlie's brother or her father will take care of her.  So we subconsciously don't even anticipate that [Charlie will be the one to die](#spoiler).

2) Likewise, Peter seems to be the most in danger.  With [his mom trying to pull his head off or light him on fire; with physically attacking himself in class.  And yet he ends up not only being the only survivor but is actually worshipped by the occult that have latched onto the family, who want to keep him safe despite the others.](#spoiler).

3) On this note, Annie says she sleepwalks and has a dream of lighting her son on fire but [it's actually her husband who is lit on fire later in the film.](#spoiler)

4) We learn of Charlie's nut allergy very early on so when she eats the cake, we think we're one step ahead of the film and it's foreshadowing that she will have a bad reaction and it will cause trouble in the house.  We don't suspect [that speeding to the hospital will be the cause of her death and the nut allergy becomes incidental](#spoiler).

5) Annie mentions her mother was schizophrenic so the audience begins to suspect [that it's all an episode in her head.  Steve even comes to this conclusion.  But it's not.  On a side note, her mother wasn't schizophrenic at all.](#spoiler)

6) We learn that Annie's brother killed himself because [his mother ""kept putting people inside him"" which we thought alluded to child molestation but by the end of the film, we know differently.](#spoiler)

The trailer continues this bait-and-switch hinting that [Annie and Charlie are the same person, hiding the fact that there were two different funerals, playing up the ""clucking"" as if it had a mysterious meaning instead of being a way to identify the ghost of Charlie when she re-appears](#spoiler).

e0f9el8,"So many thoughts on this. I feel like it would have been a stronger film if they’d taken a cue from Goodnight Mommy for the 3rd act. But I appreciated how original and entertaining it was, part of why I bummed on the ending...so close to classic status. Here’s what I want some clarity on, please tell me what’s what!!! Let’s go!

1. Granny’s headless body: Who dug it up and put it in the attic? who is benefitting from that? What can she offer as a headless body? Is she going to be a headless body forever? She’s supposed to get “riches”?? What does her being queen really mean? Seems like a bummer deal...
2. If Charlie was merely a mismatch host for Paimon, then why bother propping her head on the statue? Did “Charlie” ever exist or was it Paimon all along? Was Paimon dormant inside her until after death? What was with her having the vision in the field? Larger question...how much did Charlie know?
3. Annie rationalized all of her mom’s insane behavior as symptoms of her illnesses? Because the black triangle in her old bedroom seems crazy to brush off...how much did she know? She referred to her mom’s crazy rituals in the eulogy, so then why is she so surprised when it’s all revealed?
4. The breastfeeding diorama? Are we thinking it was art as metaphor or that literally happened? If it happened, then you mean to tell me she let her own elderly mother breastfeed her child? Even if it was some weird episode the grandmother had, then why the fuck would you let that person “latch” on to your child ever again?
5. The mother’s note that Annie reads seems like it comes from a loving place, “it will all be worth it” like they’ll all benefit...but that hardly seems true. Joan gets the best deal, she runs the show and keeps her head...
6. Walnuts in chocolate cake work of the cult? Teen cult members? That girl he had a crush on??
7. Did the grandmother love her family at all? Or was it all a means to an end, have a child to fulfill your divine purpose whatever the cost? 
8. The Dad was a real dull boy, bringing nothing to the table.
9. Why did Annie catch fire during the first attempt to burn the book, but then it killed Steve? Did burning the book set something in motion, like it officially got rid of Charlie and made way for Paimon? How could the burning thing just flip from one character to another?
10. The spirit Annie contacted was malevolent and wanted to hurt the brother. Paimon or not, that implies Charlie was evil...
11. If the boy is Paimon in the treehouse he seems like he has no clue what the fuck is happening. Kind of a let down for an evil demon king right?
12. Also all the followers were white, dumpy, and middle aged, I wonder what that says...
13. Also what’s the significance of the writings on the walls? Who is writing them?

e0g7bic,If you don’t understand why people are laughing you are missing a good chunk from the movie. Lots of dark humor. ,8pg2ma
e0gz7ne,"Why is everyone assuming all of this was real? In my mind, it seems pretty clear this is a film about a family suffering from severe paranoid schizoprenia. Everything fits, the obituary in the beginning makes it clear who was related to the Grandmother, who was known to have Schizophrenia run in the family (I believe it was her brother who killed himself was specifically mentioned to have it?)

Early on in the film a poster in a classroom clearly displays the words, ""Critical Thinking"". And a student talks about how the explanation of some book is obvious, right in front of you the whole time. Everything in the film is consistent with schizophrenia.

Only those related by blood to the schizophrenic see something supernatural happen. The father, who has no known history of schizophrenia in his family, never sees a single supernatural event occur. Schizophrenia is known to be triggered by severe psychological trauma in those who posess the genes for it, and such a trauma clearly occured in the children when they awoke to find their mother ready to light them on fire. The attempted murder while sleep walking trauma seems to have triggered the daughter's schizophrenia but not the son's.

Later on, the Mother and son are clearly *extremely* traumatized, which triggers the onset of schizophrenic symptoms in the son and exacerbates the mother's symptoms dramatically. The mother, having previously seen ""Joanne"" in a photograph or having met her years earlier without remembering, conjurs her up in her mind. The mother gives her the name ""Joanne"" because she grabbed one of her mother's embroidered doormats and hallucinated talking to this lady.

Paranoia, delusions of grandeur (being crowned a literal King), seeing strange faces, believing yourself to be on a grand mission, making connections that don't exist, speaking or writing in a totally made up language with made up characters/words, self harm, hearing voices threaten you, etc.

Peter's making bizarre bodily contortions in class is literally a textbook symptom of schizophrenia. They're a family of schizophrenics, except for the dad. That's the secret that their family tree hides. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seemed rather obvious after a certain point in the movie, everything fits too perfectly and can be explained 100% by it, and it even works with the title of the movie.",8pg2ma
e0hlla0,"Having seen it twice I better understand why this movie feels like it could be a masterpiece but falls short. I believe these 3 changes would make the film a 10/10 whereas now I would give it a 7 or 8.

1) Integrate the miniature models more into the conclusion. I think the final shot of the treehouse was meant to resemble one of Annie's models. I think they could've simply shown that final shot as a model Annie built in her workshop it would've been more chilling and the miniatures would've felt more integral. I think the director intended for this effect but was too subtle about it.

2) Cut some of the redundant scenes. I'll probably get some downvotes here, but the plot grinds to a halt after Charlie dies. We see four scenes in a row that accomplish very little but show that Annie is grieving and the plot really doesn't pick up again until Joan comes into the picture. There were some other subtle red herrings that, while they did add some potential for discourse, ultimately just padded the runtime.

3) The first two are very easily forgivable, but where the movie really lost points with me was the ending. Initially I thought i didn't like the script or how the ending was set up. On second viewing I realized that the ending was great, but it was too short and came way too late. By the time we got to the final sequence with Peter and Annie the audience was full of tension and anything they could've done would've scared the shit out of the audience. But the movie felt like it wanted to rush through the scary part to get to the cult meeting. The cult meeting would've had more impact for me if we sae Annie stalk and chase Peter for longer.

e13rkmy,"Just wanted to mention the transitions in the film because I thought they were really well utilised (especially loved the one where it's a shot of the exterior of the house, and the sky just snaps from light to dark). 

On the other hand, some of the VFX was a little off (when Annie floats up to the treehouse, it lost impact because it reminded me of when the spirits of Emily and Binx are released in Hocus Pocus, that kind of fake aura vibe that isn't done particularly well). 

Plot felt a little meandering, far too much of a slow burn for my liking, lacked suspense in my opinion. But I'm gonna have to watch it again to maybe have more of a well rounded opinion of it.

e59ttlu,"I loved the movie. Whenever I prepare myself to watch a movie, I prepare myself to catch all the little hints & foreshadowings (if any) like a little game. Doing that in this movie made a **huge** difference. I find that people that watched the movie without becoming emersed in the scenes, and anticipating jump scares did not understand the movie at all!

​

The movie was so beautifully told. The viewer is left wondering what the hell is going on throughout the movie, but if you catch the little details, and cryptic signs it all falls into place in the end. The final scenes answered all my questions and it was frightening once you realize that the cult has been involved since the beginning. On my second watch it was even more satisfying seeing how perfectly portentous the hints were. I personally love movies like this, because it engages the viewer to puzzle the pieces together. I also love horror films, so this movie goes to my top 5 movies for those reasons alone.

​

The mythology adds even more depth to the movie. I'm not religious at all, but the idea of a king of hell that gives his followers riches and honor, haunts me. If he truly is a king of hell, you can assume that all those gifts are all just bribes to ensnare his little followers. They incorporated the cult into this movie in a very non-cheesy, and tasteful way, which is very hard to do. It kind of made it believable to me. I was left wondering what happens now that Paimon has been summoned?

Overall this was a great movie, I urge you guys to read a synopsis of the movie if you didn't quite understand it.

e0stqnu,"I had such a violent physical reaction to this movie, that I may never see a horror film in the theater again. I  became hyperaware of any discomfort at the start of the movie. By the end, I was abolutely hysterical with fear -- laughing inappropriately, to the point where my eyes started to weep. My friend and I were talking aloud by the end, warning each other.  We are usually very serious about movie theater conduct, but we were just delirious with dread. I went out into the 80 degrees weather after the credits and just could not get warm. 

Really was not what I expected. I was anticipating psychological horror, and with no true supernatural elements. I even partially thought a lot of it was hokey, or would have if I wasn't scarred out of my mind.

e0rwo13,"Let’s have a discussion reddit.
Many of you on here believe Hereditary to be horror movie of 2018 and chalk it up as your personal favorites or among the best. Personally, I disagree, but would like explore your perspectives on the movie.

Me and my friends upon watching the movie found the first half to be deeply unsettling and beautifully directed, it masterfully explored the complex and deeply rooted relationships between mental illness, family, and responsibilities from Annie’s perspective. With her struggling to balance work, being a mother, and handling the death of her own mother, we can feel Annie’s sense of helplessness. Then the tragic and deeply disturbing scenes of Charlie’s death filled my theater with an air of seriousness and no nonsense. Each of Annie’s cries pulled at my heart and as I was watching it, my anticipation grew as Hereditary COULD have been the all time greatest horror movie, uniquely basing fear off of realism and the imagination of things like these happening to us in real life.

Examples of what I mean are
Peter’s scene where Charlie dies. Imagine the weight Peter
feels on his chest You have to ask yourself, if that were you, what the fuck would you do? How do you handle something like that? Then there’s the argument over dinner between Peter and Annie where both individuals deeply need each other yet are too filled with grief to do anything constructive. Imagine being anyone at that table, be it Peter, Annie, or the Dad. 

And then there’s where Annie gets possessed for a small while when she first starts her “spiritual” rituals and Peter cries because he is scared of his mother. If you were Peter at that moment of time, would you react any differently? The realism and vulnerability of the characters bring on a new sense of horror to me, a much deeper unsettling feeling of fear.

(My unpopular opinion)
And then they fucked it all up with some ridiculous scenes of naked cult members, teleporting headless mothers who are big fans of head banging. And just dumb shit. During the second half, the movie almost played out like a horror comedy satire especially that last scene where it just pans out on 6 naked old people bowing down to a decapitated head on a Jesus statue and a teenager with a broken nose. I saw the scene as a satire intended or unintended because it seemed like the movie in its last scene just perfectly makes fun of the ridiculousness of it all. It’s just a wtf? Kind of scene that almost makes you laugh after it all.
They build so much suspense and realism with the did/schizophrenia which were beautifully done by the moving mysterious lights/auditory hallucinations/ and family history that I feel the first half of the movie is wasted by the second half.
Still a great movie, and to everyone I give you my personal and explicit permission to disagree with me and hate this comment.",8pg2ma

In the beginning Charlie worries about who will look after her now that her grandma has gone and mentions that her grandma would have preferred that she was a boy/that it would be easier. This is most likely due to Charlie’s unspoken disabilities. The entire ritual is her grandma’s solution to the problem. Everything was clearly set in motion from the moment the grandmother passed judging by the grave desecration. The point wasn’t to find a new dark lord, but to protect Charlie for the rest of her life the only way she knew how, through her cult.

e0b6cv5,"So to put my opinion in context, I have seen most of the recent indie horror classics (The Witch, It Comes at Night, The Babadook, etc.) and liked most of them to varying degrees (except The Babadook, which I thought was borderline unwatchable) but have generally preferred the better made mainstream horror movies (like The Conjuring).  With that in mind, I thought this was amazing, and I hope it doesn't have the same trouble connecting with audiences that some horror movies have.

I'll start with the performances, with I thought were pretty much all very good.  Toni Collette is getting the most acclaim, and it's well-deserved, but I want to shout out to Alex Wolff. There are points in the movie where it stops being a Toni Collette vehicle and starts becoming a Wolff vehicle, and the fact that the movie doesn't suffer in those parts is a testament to his performance.

I thought the movie cultivated an unsettling atmosphere very well.  I know there weren't a ton of scares (at least for the first 90 minutes or so) but every scene is really unsettling.  There are shots in the movie that last a little longer than expected, and it creates a sense of ""what is coming next?"" that lasts the entire time.  And then once the scares ramp up at the end, they don't stop.

Plot-wise, I was really glad that the movie kept me guessing. I kept predicting that the husband was going to be evil, and I'm glad I was wrong. I'm also glad that there was an actual supernatural element. I'm a little tired of ""the humans are the real monsters."" And I know the ending is getting a bit of criticism in this post for the exposition, but it worked for me.

I know we always call out movies for having bad marketing, so I wanted to point out that this movie had really strong marketing.  The trailers were good, but didn't spoil the movie at all. The fact that they focused so much on Charlie and then killed her off was a crazy surprise that I didn't see coming at all.  Even after the accident, when the movie didn't show her body at first I was expecting her to show up fine the next day (having been possessed or something)

Speaking of the accident, everything from Charlie and Peter leaving the party through to Annie finding the body in the morning was the peak of the movie for me.  The intensity there and in the last 15-ish minutes had me squirming.

On a down note, I'm seeing a lot of people in here complaining about their audiences, and mine was no exception. There were people talking and checking their phones throughout, but no walkouts.

It really messes with you and the images are still haunting me the day after. 

I am curious how this’ll do with more casual filmgoers. I was intrigued the whole time but we’ve got a lot of indie horror films (The Witch, It Comes at Night, The Babadook, It Follows) that do well with critics and are well-liked by cinephiles but get under a 7 on IMDb and aren’t as well liked by the general populace. Not sure if more casual filmgoers will be bored by the emphasis on family drama but I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. Right now Hereditary is at 8.3, but considering it just came out, I wonder if it’ll drop in the coming weeks.

\-Charlie drawing the bird's head with a crown

I have a few **questions on a few subtleties**, can any experts answer?

.

1. The occult book shows Paimon holding 3 heads. Is beheading part of the cult's ritual?

Why were only the women beheaded?

2) What ritual was grandma performing? (In the photo she wore a wedding dress & was showered with gold coins)

2.5) Was it connected to the framed picture (treehouse) of Ellen with the caption ""Queen Ellen""?

.

.

3) The book says Paimon needs a **MALE host**, however at the end, Joan apologizes to Paimon for the ""imperfect female body""...  (perhaps Charlie?)

.

3.5) How/why would Paimon possess a female host?  When did Charlie's possession start?

Was grandma's DID simply Paimon's possession?.3.6)  Annie smiles after Steve's death, indicating Paimon's possession.  Does this imply that Steve was possessed or controlled by Paimon, and his death released him to Annie?

.

4) Why was Charlie's head on the altar, yet her **body absent**?  (Grandma & Annie's bodies were)

.

5) Was Charlie possessed by Paimon when she snipped the bird's head off?

Why was she bringing the bird's head to her grandma's bonfire?

\*I noticed a cult member smile at her from across the street after stealing the bird's head.  
.  
5.5)  Assuming Charlie was possessed by Paimon after the funeral, was her beheading orchestrated?  
Did the cult/Paimon himself put the burning deer in the road?  Did Paimon force Charlie to stick her head out the window?

.

6) **How much** did Annie know about the cult?   .While she seems naive, her actions indicate she knew grandma had sinister motives:  .

1. she forbid contact with baby Peter.   2) she subconsciously wanted to burn her kids rather than let grandma & friends get ahold of them.  .
2. While forbidding contact with her MALE child, Annie let grandma dote on her female child... she must have known males are a demon vessel....

.

7) Why were all the cult members naked?  They were quite pale, were many of them ghosts?

.

8) Why wasn't Peter charged with involuntary manslaughter?  
.  
8.5)  While he may have been stoned, WHY didn't he call the cops to report the death and  just simply go to bed??  ...and let his mom see her child headless in the car??

* There is a shot of a camera pointing to Joan's door, and with all of the foreshadowing already in the movie, it seemed to hint that it would be used to show Annie's outings to not be what they seemed
* When Annie spots Joan in the craft store parking lot, it appears that she is loading things into Annie's car (or she just has a very similar van), which could mean she imagined the whole thing while putting away bags.
* Joan constantly grabs onto Annie to try and keep her attention, much like how hallucinations constantly pull a person's attention away from other things
* During the family seance, the focus is taken off Annie and onto Steve who has a transitional shot while checking under the table, when he comes back up, Annie is snoring. This hints at a possibility that she was sleep walking the whole time and none of the ghostly stuff actually happened.
* Also, Annie talks about having sleep walked, but she also mentions that her mother had DID, it could have been possible that her sleep walking was actually other personalities taking hold
* Annie is the only person who witnesses drawing appearing in the notebook. When she tries to show her family, Steve interrupts before anything happens. It could have been possible that she was drawing them all along, but hallucinating that it wasn't actually her.
* We see some supernatural things happen from the kids' POVs, but they are around the age that schizophrenia is known to manifest in some people (mid teens)
* When Peter sees Joan shouting incantations at him, no one else pays her any attention.
* When Annie tells Steve to check the attic for her mother's body, she swats at flies that come out, Steve does not. In fact, he gives her a weird look as she does so. 
* Before Steve combusts, he begins what would have been a monologue revealing that Annie has been going insane lately and none of what she talks about is real. Of course, this is cut off by him combusting, which points out that yeah, it's real.

Up until the last moments, the entire film was carefully crafted so that there was no proof that anything weird was ever actually happening.",8pg2ma

e0kgqy8,"Man this movie was fucking crazy, I still don't know if I liked it or not. Still in shock to be honest. 



My problem mostly is the problem with most horror films, the ending.
It's kinda weak, we see Peter get possessed and we see the ritual and Charlies head and it's all very frightening but then that woman tells Charlie that he/she? is a king of hell and then just ends. In the VVitch we see the devil but then they do some demonic shit, I saw in this thread Paiman would rip out its eyes as it was foreshadowed.

e4nbc4c,"I went into watching this fairly blind, only aware that it had been well reviewed but had a controversial ending, with a lot of the film's critics saying there was too sudden a shift with the tone and plot.

In my opinion, not only is the tone consistent but the way the mystery unravels is my favorite thing about the film. There's almost no shot or line of dialogue that doesn't set you up for the ending in some way. It turned a cliche ""cult tortures and kills family in a drawn out ritual to summon a demon from hell"" plot into a tense mystery and exploration of grief and mental illness. People talk about the disturbing images, but the ones that really stuck with me were the ones that were absurd bordering on funny (the cult member staring at the funeral, the mothers body floating up to the treehouse, the cult nakedly surrounding the house under cover of night).

Wonderful performances, cinematography, and score all help elevate the experience. Only real criticism is that it ran a little long. I wasn't really sure how I felt about it when I walked out but once all the connections started to click I decided it was one of my favorite films this year.

Edit: I do concede that the ending didn't work for a lot of people. One suggestion I really liked was if they did the ending but better tied together the concept of miniatures/puppets and the idea that though the cult was manipulating the family, in a way they were manipulating Paimon himself.

Toni Collette does an amazing job as does Gabriel Byrne. Byrne is the viewer’s character and, like him, you are torn between pity for the mother as to what occurs and “I think she’s broken mentally”.

1- is “partial posession” a thing? It seems as though both Annie and her son become possessed to some degree before the true posession takes hold, as they’re both doing things against their will. However largely they still seem both in control and very much against the demonic entities until the final 20-30 minutes.

2- the blue lights / waves- are these just for the audience to know that something demonic is about to happen? I can’t recall if they happen before every event but the kids definitely seem to see them too.

3- when Annie burns the book for the first time, she herself catches on fire. However when she does it again at the end, the father instead gets lit up. Not sure I understand if that’s something tied to the book itself (the demon clearly doesn’t want the book to be destroyed) but the mechanism of choosing who is affected by the burning I’m not totally sure on. 

4- How did possessed Annie make it past the locked attic door?

5- are the gravity defying scenes (Annie on the walls, bodies levitating) supposed to be the work of Paimon ‘s powers or do you think they’re actually mental embellishments of the son because he’s losing his shit? 

Lots of questions but I keep thinking about them.

- Is Paimon an ancient being/entity? Or was he more recently created by the grandma, who seemed to be some kind cult leader (at the end her picture was labelled ""Queen""). If he is indeed an ancient entity, why was he reliant on his cult for a host? Does his host body age/die leaving him reliant on his cult for a new body?

- If he is indeed an ancient entity, why does Joan console and explain the situation to him, and call him Charlie, even, at the end. Some of that was surely for exposition, but she acted like he was young and naive. She even comforted him when he looked at his dead 'mother'.

- How much did Annie know? We viewed much of the events from her perspective, and she seemed very ignorant. However, things like her trying to force a miscarriage, and not letting her grandma near her son, but then letting her near her daughter. Apparently she conflicted with her mother so much that her husband even enforced a no-contact rule. Was Ellen just pushy and creepy? Some kind of subconscious discomfort about her?

2) Later, Annie is trying to explain to Steve that supernatural events are occurring. She shows him the grandmother's photo album, and says something like ""when we brought Charlie back, something happened."" What does she mean?

3) During the same discussion between Annie and Steve, I was intrigued by the fact that, when Annie shows Steve the photo album, the camera does not cut to the photos themselves. Steve listens to Annie, glances at the album, and says ""you did this"" to Annie. I thought, at that point, that the film would reveal that Annie and Joanie are the same person.

e1bv2gl,"Saw this last night. Really enjoyed it. 

My biggest question leaving the theater is whether Charlie's death was part of the cult's machinations or whether it was a random occurrence that it exploited to finally transfer Paimon into it's preferred host. The movie clearly showed Paimon's symbol on the telephone pole that decapitated Charlie, which suggests the cult's involvement. However, if that is the case,then the cult's plan would have had to rely on all of the following:

1. Annie forcing Charlie to go to party that Charlie did not want to go to.
2. The party hosts hand-chopping nuts to serve as a snack. (This is less problematic if you assume that some of the kids are cult members.)
3. Peter ditching Charlie to smoke with his crush. (Not implausible.)
4. Peter suggesting that an uncooperative Charlie get some chocolate cake while he was gone. (Recall that Charlie didn't want to ask for the cake because she assumed they wouldn't give her any, hence she wouldn't have eaten it had he not forcefully suggested it.)
5. The party-goers using the unwashed nut knife to cut and serve the cake.
6. That Peter would take a particular route to the hospital.

While none of this is impossible, it all seems very problematic from a narrative standpoint. My initial assumption was that the cult was planning on killing Charlie eventually, but was forced into action once Charlie accidentally died as result of Peter's accident. This would suggest the cult placed Paimon's symbol on the telephone pole after the fact to commemorate what happened there. But then I read that the [the director, basically, confirmed that the cult caused Charlie's death](https://www.inverse.com/article/45972-charlie-death-scene-in-hereditary-is-more-important-than-you-think).

Babadook - maternal anxiety, resentment 
The Grudge - long haired woman in white sideways crawling on walls

e0cxjqy,"Decided to see this at 2pm on a Friday, and I was the ONLY ONE in the theater. No clicks or annoying reactions from fellow movie-watchers to worry about for me, but I had to watch this movie ALONE.  

What a brilliant horror movie that was, no reliance on jump-scares, no ""monster"" that's overly-revealed, no sappy teenage love story (so glad they didn't expand on Peter's girl interest, they definitely could have). They revealed just enough with almost perfect lighting to deliver the horror, and when they did choose to reveal something oh boy did they reveal it. ([that shot of Charlie's head will likely haunt me as much as the demon-girl's face in Exorcist, the scene where Peter smashes his face into his desk, etc.](#spoiler)

As much as I want to, I don't think I can get the courage to sit through this one again though. Unless some of the deleted scenes show up with the bluray release, this one viewing has damaged me enough (which is the mark of a truly well-made horror movie).",8pg2ma

e0mvn7b,"I went into this movie not knowing much other than seeing one trailer, and all I had really garnered from that was that it looked like a commentary on familial mental illness. 
Now, it seems like I’m an outlier here but I found this movie to be pretty predictable in the grand scheme. Charlie’s death threw me for a loop, sure, but the second Joan came into the picture I knew what was up (loosely, with the cult, not the details). With that being said, here’s my (likely unpopular opinion)...
I really liked where it was going and my initial thoughts were that it could still be a portrayal of mental illness, up until the ending. I really thought it was going to end after Peter jumped out the window, and to me that would’ve been perfect. 
Obviously there are plenty of mental illness themes woven throughout, but I feel like the ambiguity would’ve left me with more than the heavily supernatural ending. The best horror to me is relatable horror, and after the whole treehouse scene and speech, the movie stuck less as it was easier to write off than say, DID, schizophrenia, paranoid delusions or manic depression destroying the family from the inside out. Thoughts?  
Nonetheless, it was a tremendous movie. I wanted it to end and keep going at the same time. I never want to see it again but I want to talk about it for hours. ",8pg2ma

e0bnkmf,"Has anyone found like the meaning of the movie? It was so brilliantly made that I found myself in the theater wondering if it was some type of mental illness from Annie I was seeing or genuine occult cult stuff.

The only conclusion I came to after watching was that the grandma (and Joan) were trying to conjure the King Paimon guy and since Annie didn't let her near Peter, Charlie was the original vessel. After she gets decapitated (holy shitballs, by the way), Joan manipulated Annie, who had a mental illness, whether that was DID like her mom or schizophrenia like her brother, to redo the ritual on Peter; at the end they needed Peter to kill himself so that Paimon can take over the body of the male and give them all riches like the book said. Does that add up?


But I don't see how the grief people or naked dudes tie in to that theory, or that creepy smiley dude with Charlie at the beginning. Also doesn't explain how Annie defied gravity at the terrifying scene where she's smashing her head against the ceiling after Peter pulls the stairs up or hanging off the ceiling in the living room.

e0gwl3s,"Successfully avoided all trailers and most reviews for this, hooray! Only recently even got the general premise accidentally spoiled. Pretty proud of myself, usually watch trailers as soon as they come out...

The mother's monologue at the dinner table about nobody admitting anything just brought a shit-eating grin to my face, it was absolutely electrifying. Definitely hilight of the flick for me. Great performances all around, and while the plot was a bit cliche it did the job well and provided a completely satisfactory justification for funky scares and fabulous imagery.

I gotta wonder if Paimon had stayed in Charlie's body until older age and hadn't been decapitated if he would've just gotten a sex change and taken over the world from there. Seems like a premise for a hell of a B-movie, male demon inhabiting a female body does hormone therapy and eventually surgery and all the while his powers grow as his host conforms to his natural inclinations. I can't believe I actually typed that out.

Also, the dog was pretty under-utilized? Like, it shows up for a bit, completely disappears, comes back, gone again. I'd have liked to see more of the dog tbh.

Overall I'd say 9/10, not really cinematic greatness but wonderful spoopy time in movie theater.

There was so much buildup to get the characters built up, tension built up and then the end with Peter getting crowned felt...bad. Everything felt so rushed at the end and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm assuming there will be sequels from this with Peter causing havoc. I will say though I thought this was going to be another daughter is possessed and kills the family but when she died I was swerved.

Poor Charlie, I hate to see when a little odd girl like her had to die in such horrifying way. I almost rather see her become this badass demon child that most audiences were expecting to see, but then we wont have this one of the most iconic horror scene of all time.

Poor Peter, slowly breaking down by witnessing traumatic events happening one after another on his loved ones, at the end being reduced to calling Annie Mommy and begging her to stop, really is the most pure form of helplessness and despair I’ve ever seen.

Poor Annie and Steven, you guys just want to be the loving and supportive parents to your kids...but it ended up like this, I can’t even start to imagine seeing your own child dying in such gruesome way and slowly realising your other child is not safe either.

I really want to see the movie for a second time because I pretty much missed 1/3 of it as I closed my eyes everytime anything’s about to happen. But then I really struggles to sleep at night.....I’m torn, HALP!!!

I  see this film holding two interpretations. 

1: Everything in this film happened for real to the characters. The possession cult hatched a convoluted plan to give rise to their lord through this family. 

2: As the film progresses the character’s disorder rapidly takes over and wreaks havoc upon her mind. We see everything through the perspective of someone with such a terrible condition who concocts an outlandish story as a result of her psychosis. The son and daughter also experience effects because they inherited it through their mother and grandmother. The father does not feel any effects as he is not of that blood line.

About halfway through the movie it was super obvious that we were in Rosemary's baby territory. Once I realized that, the film meandered a whole bunch with misdirects and non\-plot\-furthering moments until it went into full on ""horror"" mode. The first half of the film was fantastically eerie and far scarier than what followed it. The scenes toward the end that were supposed to be scary just seemed cliche and cheesy (the zillion times someone is just off screen in the darkness or hiding near the ceiling, the stupid way they switched to grinning to indicate possession). I also really wish they had not included that weird voiceover at the end that basically explained the already pretty obvious possession plot line that was in no way unique or original enough to require an in depth expository voiceover.

I felt like this movie borrowed a lot from the Witch in a lot of ways, too. Even the ending had a lot of similarities. I think if I hadn't seen the Witch, I would've liked this film a lot more because it wouldn't have begged so much comparison.

3- Why did Annie's husband burn up when the book was thrown in the fire? Because at first she was going to burn.

There are more subtle clues to support this.

I actually think the [supernatural aspect](#spoiler) hindered the 3rd act.

No joke, half the theater laughed at the part where Charlie’s head got decapitated. -___- Was really annoying but I still enjoyed the film nonetheless.

Some final thoughts:

1). I always thought there was something amiss with the obit at the beginning.  Now I see what it is.  The obit states that Ellen died at Annie's home.  Not Peter and Annie's home.  Just Annie's home.

2). When Annie goes over to Joan's house for the first time, there's no doorknob, at least not in the wood.  Just a lock.    They never shut the door when Annie first walks in.  When Annie goes over the third time, we see the doorknob and lock on the outside of the door is present but different from the inside of the door.

3). When Annie walks in her mom's old room room, the picture on the nightstand looks like a picture of Joan and Ellen.

4). When Annie walks into the group therapy for the first time, she winds up pulling up a chair between two folks that isn't there to begin with rather than take the empty chair that's available.

5). Based on the facts of the film, I believe that a woman's mother died in the house as stated in the obit.
Not in hospice as Annie stated in group therapy.

6). I believe the real daughter is Joan.

7). I believe the daughter put the mother's body in the attic.

8). I believe the daughter threw herself in her work in the workshop, and created the story we see, with psychological ramifications that I can only speculate on.

9). Peter and Charlie's rooms don't exist in the real house, only the model, so I believe they don't exist at all.

10). I believe Gabriel Byrne is a very good looking actor.

11). I'm done with Reddit.  I'll still continue to work on the fan website and watch the film as long as I can.

Good luck everyone.",8pg2ma

e0dbs76,"I viewed the story as three generations from a family with similar, severe mental illnesses triggered by Charlie’s death. Annie said her brother had schizophrenia, it’s likely her son would Too ( runs in the family, it was hereditary). The only character that stays rational is the father because he’s not blood related ( he’s even a bit foreign, as evidenced by his subtle accent). Annie is paranoid the whole time and she’s trying to put together a puzzle that’s not there. She thinks she’s seeing things more clearly but she’s clearly descending into madness.",8pg2ma
e0e2lfu,"Fantastic movie. The score was perfect for the setting. All of the wide shots looked great. Acting was superb. I only had a few complaints, mainly with the last 5-10 min. But there’s very few movies I can remember that unsettled me like this. Hereditary is certainly a slow burn/big payoff film. 

I’m curious as to what Joane added to Annie’s drink while they’re having tea. Annie clearly pulled something black out of her mouth, and Joane just didn’t look too surprised. I’m sure it’s some ritual/cultist thing, I was just wanting a little explanation. 

",8pg2ma
e0kl5mp,"Commenting again because I just cannot stop thinking about this film.

The soundtrack was insane, in a good way. I just found out it's on Spotify and I have been listening to this track 'Reborn', which plays at the very end when Peter heads to the treehouse.

Can someone answer these questions please?

So Charlie the entire time was the Paimon guy?

The grandma and her friend (Ann Dowd) were colluding to get Paimon into Peter, but he ended up in Charlie instead right? And the grandma was some sort of queen to her followers.

Did they somehow create the events that killed Charlie or was that just a happy coincidence?

How did the grandma get into the attic?

What happened in the scene at the end in the attic? I knew something terrible was gonna happen and I didn't want the images stuck in my brain. I'm pretty sure the mom cut her head off, and then it sounded like some other guy was there whacking off or something. Was there another man there? And if so what was he doing?

Also the most disturbing to me was Charlie getting decapitated. Man... the thud and then the following few minutes if the movie were horrific.

Edit: in regards to Charlie's death I just read this:

""However, specifically as it relates to Charlie’s death, Aster did confirm that it was very much “designed by the cult.”

“That was not as much of a freak accident as it might seem when you’re watching it for the first time,” he added.""",8pg2ma

I just can't quite vibe with films with unstoppable forces (with seemingly no rules) - that doesn't mean I want a happy ending, but stuff just got worse and worse until everybody died, not much conflict or stakes there and the way it all went down just kind of got a shrug for me. It's a fairly boilerplate possession ending, just with a lot more interesting visual flair.

Good movie but it's another example of critics overhyping prestige horror - not even remotely ""the next Exorcist"" as its been called. It's creepy, foreboding, and tense, sure, but terrifying it is not.

Also fun fact: I didn't realize until last night that when he sleeps my husband makes a ""THOCK"" sound with his mouth from time to time that I swear made me almost physically scream last night). I am still confused about the grave digging.

\- Steve accuses Annie of digging up the grandma's grave, which would have happened shortly after the burial, before Charlie has died.

\- Annie is surprised to learn, when rifling through her mother's books, about Paimon, the plan for a male host, her grandmother's satanic rituals. She doesn't know any of the satan worshippers who came to grandma's funeral. This suggests that Annie is not in on the Paimon plot or aware of the cult.

Who actually dug up the grandma's grave? Who decapitated grandma and put her body in the attic? Was is Annie while sleepwalking? How is this possible, when Annie didn't know about the cult? Does Annie have DID and one of her other personalities dug it up?

Was it Ann Dowd or one of the other satanic cult members?  If so, how did they get the body in the attic?

Also I’m not sure if this was intentional, but after Peter’s nose is broken and he is at home, there is a profile shot that stuck with me. His profile with the nose cast made it look hook-like.

- What was with the tealeaf in Annie’s drink when Joan first gives Annie the tea at her apartment? I originally felt she may have drugged her somehow, but it never really came back to that. Was there any significance?

- Was Charlie actually the demon? I originally thought so, and Joan’s speech at the end would allude to that as well, but she also sees the same type of light that ends up inside Peter at the end and she follows it into the woods, so that kind of led me to believe she wasn’t. Was it that someone was performing a ritual to her and she was simply able to see it no matter where she was, and the light was just a beacon to that ritual?

This movie isn't like those. It actually delivers. 

It's a slow burn, similar I'd say to The Shining. Where it methodically puts the pieces on the board. Then about half way through there's the seance scene and the movie shifts gears. The creepiest part I would wager to be when the kid wakes up with his broken nose, in his bed. As he starts to sit up the camera pans out. You can barely tell something is off, and it makes you uneasy. Because Allie was actually in the top corner of the ceiling like a predator stalking its prey. It's so faint I won't be surprised if a lot of people missed it.

The movie does well at ratcheting tension and building an uneasy dread. And through it all there's probably... 2? jump scares. I would have expected a few more, tons of places they  could have lazily jutted some in, but pleasantly happy to see such restraint.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to a second viewing to catch many of the tiny details I definitely missed on a first view.

**edit*: Also, maybe it was my imagination. But some of the panning shots looked like they were not of the house/set but of the tiny model.

I think the title Hereditary refers to extreme mental illness, passed down from both the grandparents, to both the mom and her brother, and then down to the kids. The mom is paranoid schizophrenic, and the dad knows this and knows that his kids are probably also disturbed, and that explains the way he acts throughout the film.

It’s sad it’s confusing and it sucks that there are people out there who think those movies are the best movies. Anyways I loved the movie I was very shocked when Charlie died and it was from that moment when it showed her decapitated head on the road that I knew that this movie was somethin else.

I want to say a different way but that doesn’t make sense. Alex Wolff was very good and the whole car scene was really disturbing once again and he really helped to carry that whole thing. Toni Collette was very good as yuj. There was something I really liked about that weird light throughout the movie. I was confused by it and also really wanted to understand it haha. The thing I really want to say about this movie is that for me it was one of those movies that I hyped up maybe way too much and maybe gave it too much thought leading up to seeing it and it really set my expectations high. As the movie unfolded I found myself slightly disappointed and after it was over I was still kinda disappointed. Now a couple hours after I have seen it I can’t stop thinking about it and I realize just how good it really was and that I want to and will go see it again tomorrow yep oh yeah oh hello yeah. Those are the best kinds of movies ,8pg2ma
e0iv8ue,"Two thoughts after just leaving a theater full of very skittish teenagers. 

1. The sound design on this film is amazing.

2. I wish they had honestly cut the dialogue for the last 20 seconds of the movie. We don't need that shit spelled out, we're not pants-on-head stupid. From the moment they showed us the text in the book, it became obvious where the plot was going. I thought that was fine, as it just added to the suspense (i.e. the audience knows a bomb is under the table, but not the characters). Why would they just summarize what happened throughout the entire movie? Sooo bad.",8pg2ma
e0da3ji,"Wow, I hated this movie. Shave off 45 mins by reducing the “slow walk slow realization” that happened every 10 minutes. The plot didn’t start to take any form until an hour into the movie, and at the point all the pieces were so frequent and spread out that there was literally no pay off until the last 3 minutes. 

They absolutely went way too subtle. Cool concept. Great acting. Too slow. Using a super potent horror story/imagery as a vehicle for human/grief exploration  needs to be executed better. ",8pg2ma
e0w86ys,"Watching the movie I thought there was a lot of great stuff in the movie, it's just i felt none of it came together into anything meaningful or really scary, I and most of the audience i was with was laughing at parts that were meant to be scary. Also this 2 hour movie felt about 3 hours long, but Horror is polarizing as a genre and I didn't like the Babadook like everyone else, but liked The Witch and lt Follows, wish the movie was more like those.",8pg2ma
e1aet3q,"the scene where peter went down to see his dead father and saw a fucking naked guy smiling at him had me laughing harder than i have in years. Some parts of this movie are really creepy, but my god the ending scenes were borderline comedy for me",8pg2ma
e0g907d,"The first half of the movie does an amazing job at being unsettling and horrifying in a realistic way. The second half does really well at being spooky without having to rely too much on jumpscares. Unfortunately, about halfway through, the plot takes a big dip in quality for me personally. I still really enjoyed it, but the cult stuff was a little too cliche. I feel like this has already been done in one of the paranormal activities but I could be wrong. Up until the first seance, I was convinced that the movie was about mental illness, and that was why it was called Hereditary. ",8pg2ma
e0n0nrt,"This movie is extremely well shot and acted, but for me totally falls flat in the end. The buildup was great, but the payoff was generic as hell. Cult/devil stuff? Cmon.

e0d6xvm,"the scene in the attic with peter, as soon as that noise started i knew exactly what it was...... uck ",8pg2ma
e0f9iag,"Wow, I was way off in my theory or what I took the movie to be. I saw it as the grandmother having DID and thinking she was a god, then the mother having DID (hence the sleepwalking and the ""waking up"" look while her husband burned, and Charlie's voice coming out of her), then the son having schizophrenia and thinking he was a god at the end. I thought Joan was made up since no one else heard her but then I thought maybe she was the grandma's best friend and stuck in their minds during their breakdowns. I figured Annie snapped at her mom dying and that brought on her DID then Peter snapped at his sister dying, bringing on his schizophrenia. The father was the only one who saw the reality of his family breaking down so the mom killed him in one of her DID episodes. As for the cult at the end, I honestly thought it was all in Peter's head as people he'd seen at the funeral... The whole ""delusions of grandour"" that often come with schizophrenia. Reading through this thread... I was way off! My big questions though are how did Annie get in the attic if it was locked and how did she float to the tree house? I actually loved the movie thinking it was a visual trip through psychotic breakdowns... But the whole demon thing makes me NOT like it because it's just another Paranormal Activity grandma getting her grandkids set up for a demon 😟",8pg2ma
e0ftwa9,"Three things I already knew, but can easily sum up this movie:

1. Grief is complicated.
2. Mental health care is best handled by an independent third party, not a family member.
3. Don’t try to summon the dead.  It never ends well.

Also, nut allergy anaphylaxis is so much quicker in real life than the movies show.  Charlie probably would have been dead before leaving the house.  If not dead, at least unconscious.  Source: Multiple anaphylaxis level allergies myself.

Despite all of the above, I still enjoyed the movie, particularly Toni Collette’s acting.  I did more or less figure out the end about halfway through the film, but it was still a pretty decent trip out of the house on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  ",8pg2ma

e0glpel,"Love love love this movie. Can’t wait to see it again and catch all the things I missed on the first go-around. Weirdly enough, parts of the plot reminded me of the aspects of the demon in Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, though the movies are clearly different in quality. The idea of a male host needed, older women whose connections don’t become clear until later in the film, etc. 

Also, I had some pretty annoying people in the theater as well. A woman wouldn’t stop laughing at Charlie’s death (to be fair, I think she’d come in drunk), and it went on so long that she had to leave the theater. While I wasn’t too mad, it kind of took away from the intensity for me. However, hearing Toni Collette’s screams brought me right back. 

Anyway, this movie is definitely making my top 5 list of all-time.

The only good scene was the sister's death. That was genuinely surprising and shocking, but everything else that followed was just incredibly boring. I thoroughly enjoyed The Witch and It Follows, but this was just plain horrible for me. I think I would've enjoyed the movie more if it wasn't 2 hours long.

e0hkwqe,"After seeing the movie last night, I still don’t have a full-fledged opinion on it but here are my takeaways

what i liked:
- performances were great, especially collette, her spiral into insanity was great
- cinematography was incredible (aside from one thing ill touch on later), director really showed talent
- a few scenes that had me on the edge of my seat or with my jaw dropped (car ride, dinner, and bugs for anyone who saw the movie)

now for what may get me some flack
what i didnt like:
- day for night shots were painfully obvious, there was a scene where i genuinely thought it was morning time but was actually midnight
- the scene where annie sees something in the dark at the beginning was genuinely creepy, too bad that type of stuff never really happens again
- the second act dragged hard
- and then the third act comes out of nowhere, feels like a different movie, and just gets whacky and silly
- literally the last scene of the movie has exposition, maybe this shit shoulda gotten the spotlight during that drag of a second act or just say nothing and have fans theorize

e0k7lda,"Damn that was crazy. Really loved it. It definitely felt it's length though. The whole first hour, while gripping, felt like the movie was already almost over but then it went for another hour. Very drawn out but it worked really well to create a very intense final 30 or so minutes. Very well built as well with everything having a meaning at some point. The way it all ties together at the end is just really well done. 

I just wish the last shot of the film was that picture of the grandmother. I think it would've been a more hard hitting end if after Ann Dowd's final speech the camera panned over to the grandmother on the wall and then cut to black. Nonetheless amazing film that was an incredibly well thought out horror/thriller that I hope we continue to get more of",8pg2ma

Well, I was very interested in this movie because I like Toni Collette, that the trailers freaked me out and A24 released it (great company).  Was a bit long, took a bit to get to it but...holy hell!  I think of Rosemary's Baby (never cared for it but, it fits), The Exorcist/Exorcist 3, A Quiet Place, Valhalla Rising, Witch  and even Wait Until Dark (sure, not horror but the suspense).  It was a mind fuck of a movie that makes me want to watch it again but not in a theater with teenagers.  We went on $5 night at SMG, worth it.",8pg2ma
e0l3pq1,"Enjoyed the movie! Definitely the best horror movie I’ve seen since The Witch and Don’t Breathe. Question tho, how did the husband light on fire? Definitely was the cause of either Paimon or the dead grandmother but a little lost. Were the spirits basically omnipotent? Were they only playing with Annie when she tried to burn the sketchbook? Definitely played against audience expectations when the husband burned instead but felt that it was too easy of a scenario when it played out. 

Only issue I have with the movie is that the dark family drama and straight-on horror of the third act felt too mutually exclusive. Particularly, I was expecting the mom to have more of an arc facing her past family trauma at the end.",8pg2ma
e0l5h0j,"One thing I noticed is how weird their marriage was even before Charlie died. Steve, throughout most the of film, seems very indifferent about the horror that is happening. And when he does show emotions, it was in a weirdly calm manmers (except for the scene where he cries)that lasts for a few seconds. He doesn't seem to care about his wife or daughter. Only his son who seems to be only who is normal besides him at first. 

It doesn't feel like he was really involved in the family and only stays in the marriage because of his son. Another thing is how the mother never talks much about her struggles coping with the deaths. Whenever we see him, he's just around the house not really doing anything and maybe one scene in his office but nothing else comes out of it. His reaction to his daughter's death is also weirdly calm. I don't know why but it puzzles me the entire movie, it's not something creepy just weird. 

Then he suddenly dies from the notebook with no explanation. We know that the notebook is supposed to kill the mother but it ends up to be Steve is unclear. 

He is a part of family but he is insignificant, indifferent, and calm it's just weird. Technically, he is not in the bloodline. I thought the sacrifice could only be done by sacrificing the members in the cult leader's bloodline?

I'm willing to go along with most of the movie on suspension of disbelief alone. One open loop I keep coming back to is Annie's possession - what was that all about? Didn't seem to follow, even in the cryptic context of the narrative. Who/what was she possessed by? Why is it just possessing her now? If she had such a crucial role to play in the succession of Paimon's host bodies, why did her mother keep her from her Spiritualist practices her entire life?

Caveat: I don't need answers - not from the filmmaker, anyway. *The last thing I want is a ""Hereditary: Origins"" prequel or some other kind of franchise garbage.* I (and if you're here, I'm assuming you) appreciate not being spoonfed, but as far as discussing the movie I feel like those are important parts to get feedback from other viewers on.

[where Charlie lost her head. It suggests to me that the cult knew that she would lose her head there, which is nuts to me. It’s not like the cult fed Charlie the cake that gave her an allergic reaction. It’s not like they put an animal carcass there. Even if they did, they’d have no idea that Peter would be going fast enough to the point where he’d need to swerve to avoid it. They’d also be banking on the fact that he’d choose to swerve right at the same time Charlie would stick her head out the window. If it could be chalked up to supernatural shenanigans, I didn’t feel like it was presented that way.
The rest of the movie feels like the plan to summon the Paimon relies heavily on the help of his followers, so having that thrown in there was off for me.](#spoiler)",8pg2ma

2) When Annie first met up with Joan, she drinks tea (?) and she pulls something out of her mouth (tea leaf?) and the camera zooms in on it. What was the significance here?

3) Also Charlie was Paimon from the second we saw her, right? She lived with her grandma who I'm guessing conjured Paimon in her as a child. But when Annie casts the spell with Steve and Peter, was that the original Charlie we hear yelling ""mom"" using Annie's body?

By the time you reach the finale when the pace, at last, picks up, it's over in 5 minutes.

I will give the director credit, though.  His comedic timing for Charlie's thunk into the pole was perfect, as well as the thunk as the body hits the attic floor after Peter jumps out the window.

Speaking of jumping out the window, are we supposed to believe Petey died and was resurrected as that Paimon guy?  Because jumping out of a third story window into a garden almost certainly won't kill you, especially when you land on not-your-head.

I knew from the very beginning that Joan was ""the bad guy"". The father is a completely useless character, the movie would have been the same without his character. The way we ""jump"" from ""Annie is crazy"" to ""this is come kind of witchcraft"" is ridiculous! Of course there had to be some kind of Voice over to explain the plot, it gets so confusing to the point where you start to think that the filmmakers wanted some things to be in the film and they wrote around that stuff so those would work.

And last, but not least: So the grandma has an entire photo album of her pals and her summoning and worshipping a demon? That is SO CLICHE! The thing where ""I discover the twist by looking at some photos"". Damn it, that was the point when I thought ""wow, that's just lazy story telling"".

Anyway, on the bright side, I thought Toni Collette was great. Technically, the movie is good. Most US movies are.

I thought the movie was masterfully made. The direction, cinematography, acting, it was all absolutely fascinating to watch. But the story.....the best way I can describe how I felt is that I thought the movie should *mean* something else, something more. Like it felt like everything was an allegory or a metaphor for something else but it just...wasn't. The story was the story. No deeper meaning. Which, in a roundabout way, I sort of respect. But while watching it, I just felt like I was missing something, like I wasn't understanding the deeper meaning I should have been. But I wasn't. So in that regard, I felt a bit underwhelmed.

Note that nothing in Hereditary is explained... you have to piece the story and clues together yourself .. and it is all there, this is so intricately structured... no plot holes here. 

Ari Aster made the decision to put the audience squarely in the shoes of the sacrificial lambs, hence the unease ... we learn information the same time they do, we never see who’s pulling the strings or why. 

And the information doesn’t always have to be telegraphed... case in point the words scrawled on the walls.  Never explained but the fact that they are there to begin with, not in English... we see them as Annie discovers them... that is simply enough. No exposition needed to know this should make you slightly uneasy...Annie’s not going to get an answer so why should the audience?  We need to experience the manipulation or be the detective ... when we do, we have t just watched a movie... we become emotionally attached to it.

No more exposition (and lots more Ari Aster please!!!)",8pg2ma
e0k1a03,"I'm not very familiar with the horror genre and don't fully understand its conventions, but I thought I'd step out of my comfort zone and give this movie a shot. However, I left somewhat confused and disappointed.

Although I didn't love *A Quiet Place*, I thought it had a very strong opening. Within the first ten minutes, I got a sense of the world, the characters, the stakes, I was ready for the ride and the rest of the movie definitely delivered. *Hereditary*, on the other hand, felt unbearably slow. The inciting incident occurs, which was delightfully shocking, but when I expected the horror to start and be treated to the promise of the premise, we are instead presented with an hour of exposition and domestic drama. Nothing very scary happens until Annie's seance, and then the movie really picks up. 

In my opinion, I felt that Annie's seance should have been the lock-in, not (what felt like) the midpoint. All I knew about the movie was the poster and the logline posted above in this thread's description, so what I expected was a horror movie with some awesome lore about a curse/evil that has haunted this family for generations, and maybe how they were going to stop it. However, upon seeing the movie, I do not think that the logline is accurate. The domestic drama about grief is truly the main focus of the movie, and the horror ""ancestral secrets"" are actually secondary (and only get going after the midpoint). To better represent this tonal shift, I thought a better logline would be something like: ""A grieving mother struggles to cope with the tragic loss of her daughter, but when she tries to get in contact with her daughter's spirit, she unknowingly releases an ancient evil.""

Overall, I think the logline gave me misaligned expectations for the movie. If the logline better reflected what the movie was about, or if I didn't know anything at all, I think I would have appreciated the movie more.",8pg2ma

...OH. Wait, sorry no. This is something else entirely.

So, I just saw this an hour ago so I'm still processing everything. When I walked out of the theatre I had this sense of dread with me and then it started to downpour, and my sense of dread just increased even more. I still can't quite shake it.

I loved the cinematography in this movie, so many layers, so many great looking and unique shots. It really sets this movie apart from other horror movies with similar stories. Toni Collette is a fucking acting god and I hope the academy will at least nominate her for her performance. She makes this movie.

There are many newer horror movies out there that have have a similar plot to Hereditary, but not many that do it quite like this. It felt familiar yet completely different at the same time. Very unsettling.

I will say I have some issues with what they chose to show. This is more personal preference, but I wish they could just leave some stuff to the imagination instead of showing everything. Maybe leave the ending open ended so it's up to our interpretation to what happened instead of just giving us all the answers on a silver platter? I also want to mention there are a couple glaring plot holes ( why aren't the children being investigated by the school for abuse. Why did the boy not go to jail?, etc.)

I thought Toni Collette's son, while fine, didn't really live up to the level of acting as the rest of the cast. I mean, fucking Toni Collette in this movie is something else. Performance of the year, honestly. The son just felt flat most the time to me.

Also, the daughter. Isn't it obvious she has something mentally wrong with her? Why are they treating her like a normal girl? The way she looks is extremely off putting. I feel bad for the actress that played her, she almost feels like she was cast for her unsettling appearance?

I actually felt some similarities with The Witch from a couple years ago, just how the movie is paced, how things worked out story wise. I still think I like the Witch better, but this movie is great as well.

It's awesome to have some really unique horror movies finally starting to come out and hopefully it does well enough to get studios to green light some more artistic films in the genre. I look forward to watching this movie again soon. I think it's great and I look forward to what else this director will do in the future.",8pg2ma
e0f5iad,"I was so excited after seeing the trailer and reading reviews, to see this film.

I loved Charlie's death and everything leading up to it. I was still invested in the parts after.

But the ghost medium stuff felt really campy, and then the movie slowed to a crawl. I kept waiting for the second half to scare me, but nothing really did. The bird hitting the window, and Annie jumping at her son were the only things that scared me in any capacity, and they were just jump scares. Annie swimming through the air out of Peter's room looked ridiculous; multiple people in my theater laughed. I also thought the scene with Peter screaming in the classroom was bordering on comical.

The film after Peter enters the attic just became a big pile of ""...what?"" for me.

I really wanted to like this film, and the foreshadowing and stuff was cool. But overall I just feel deceived by the raving reviews and promises of genuine scares and suspense.",8pg2ma

e0uwpzi,"My only gripe with this movie is the casting... Gabriel Bryne is a good actor, but holy crap is he out of place in this film, IMO.

The guy is almost 70, and while I know there are families that have an older dad like this (he's 22 years older than Toni Collette), it's definitely not very common and if the idea is to make the parents relatable at the beginning I think they fell a bit flat on this front.  

The father character just felt a bit flat the whole movie to me, and I also don't think he looks very much like the son.  The daughter looked enough like the movie, but the boy looked like neither parent at all, to the point where I wondered if maybe it would turn out he was adopted or was from a previous marriage of the husband's.

This was not met by condemnation from his group, but rather by sympathetic chattering and sniggering.

The pained reaction of “ugh, I have to read” is always something I suspected was there in some people, but never made so explicit.

e0fm4yi,"They kinda fumbled the ending. It felt so grounded and subtle until they went full occult/supernatural in the last 30ish minutes. I honestly thought they were going the whole “it’s in their heads/ this all can be scientifically explained route”.  They gave so many hints that mental illness and sleepwalking ran in the family, hence the title, when in reality it was a double meaning because the beliefs and practices were also hereditary. Idk I would have liked a more ambiguous ending, or at least one that was much less typical of a horror movie. Still a great movie overall however. The tension, camera work, acting, atmosphere, and visuals were all excellent. Without that ending this would be the next exorcist, but I’d give it a solid 8/10.",8pg2ma
e7wp5xq,"This movie has great acting and directing. It has bad sound editing, doesn't have a big horror factor , and lacks originality. It's an amalgamation of Rosemary's Baby, The Babadook, and Paranormal Activity. Nothing that new here. 

The head scene was just exploitative, but maybe it's in horror movies' nature to be exploitative. The character's mouths didn't line up with the sound in some scenes. There was a possibility that this was just all in the mother's head as she may have had heriditary schizophrenia. However, that and the sleepwalking was just a red herring thrown in. It dared you to try and guess the ending with that ""arrogant guy who wasn't paying attention during the play"" line. However, it showed the guy smiling at the funeral, and that the creepy old dead lady's weird cult symbol was on the hydropole right in the beginning. From there, it was easy to tell that it was about an evil cult, and when the story of how her brother killed himself came about, it was clear that there was a host ritual going on. Either the schizophrenia was a red herring at that point, or the cult aspect was.

I dunno, maybe I'm just dense. I don't see the significance of her making these super creepy dioramas and writing words on the walls of her little dioramas. 

I haven't had a horror movie unsettle me in a long long time, I think I'm just getting jaded. I'm not mad, I just left feeling a little unfulfilled I guess.

Honestly was rooting for the mother to protect her son.  Just with the whole
My mother wasn’t great, my son hates me and I failed him & my daughter.  It would have been icing on the cake with the mother protecting her son.  And as scary as the last 10 minutes were it was predictable as soon as it started and easy to see where it went off.

It failed on a payoff level and killing off the protagonist off screen and having her be some demon was just ugh.  At least Rosemary had somewhat of a win, she’d be able to take care of the child as her own.  Theres some hope.

No jump scares, great acting, but unfortunately this movie just didn't scare me. And I'm a huge chicken. Can anyone explain why this movie is getting such praise and also why Charlie's actress getting ""great break out performance"" when she got her head knocked off after about 15 lines of dialogue

It started off good, the death of the girl was incredibly shocking and the aftermath was interesting. But then when it started going into possession and the occult it just lost me. The climax was a bunch of random crazy scenes one after the other with the film tripping over itself just to reach it's ending. All tension was gone because you had no idea if you were watching a nightmare, a delusion, a sleepwalking. The film went off the rails and not in a good way. I was laughing by the end of the film along with most of the audience. It's a shame because there was a lot of potential here that was squandered. Toni Collette is the only great thing in this film.",8pg2ma

And if King Paimon only possesses vulnerable males, why did he bother with females like Charlie and Annie for?",8pg2ma
e0dkrii,"Did not love this movie. I am sure other people have the same reaction but, here are my main complaints about the movie.

1) Does understanding the mythos of this movie make it scarier? Honestly, when things make sense, they are less scary to me personally. An example of this is the use of decapitation in the movie. Paimon (who is a ""spirit"" in other places of fiction) likes decapitation. This is super cleaverly used in the movie to let us know Charlie is Paimon. However, the movie never really tells us this.

2) How much foreshadowing is enough? does everything in this movie have to mean something? I genuinely like a movie that i have to think about NOT a movie I have to explain to people I went to see the movie with.

3) Metaphors are nice literary devices. They are great in bad 90's music. How many of them do you need to use? For all of you that missed it, the end of the film it  takes place in the tree house. It is the "" Family Tree "" ... grown

4) I hate that you need a diagram to understand the basic plot of the movie. Breakdown
Grandma runs a cult
Uncle hangs himself to prevent himself from being possessed by Paimon
Anne disassociates herself from Grandmother after having a son. 
Anne has a daughter and lets Grandma back in the picture.
Paimon takes over Chalie's body while grandma breast feeds her.
Paimon cant assend as a female. (Why not? No idea it is never explained)
Anne sleepwalks and attempts to kill her kids. Anne was possessed probably by her brother to prevent Paimon from returning?
Charlie gets her head cut off.
Annie  meets Joanie. 
Joan shows her ritual to talk to ""Charlie""
This opens the house up to the spirits.
Peter is possessed by his Uncle who tries to kill him. (This is a good thing?)
Annie finds Grandma's body in the attic. 
The Dad goes up in flames?
Peter (in a weakened state) is chased by Annie and ends up going out a window. 
Peter is possessed by Paimon.
Assends to ""Family Tree"" House (grown)
Assumes thrown in front of the doll with  Charlie's head, a headless Grandma, a headless Mother and naked cult members.

Conclusion

this is all too much. Amazing acting and cinematography mask the overly cluttered story hide the fact that this movie makes no sense at all. 

Just use a little bit of exposition for God sake and explain to everyone what is going on. ",8pg2ma
e0fno72,"#spoiler
Even though the ending does make sense after reading into it more and giving the movie more attention outside the cinema, i still firmly believe that it was executed poorly and could have been done in a much better fashion. 
Also when Peter jumps out of the attic, part of me was hoping that we would get a ""prologue"" type text appear on a black screen how the local police found a body of the father and a burnt down tree house, with Annie and Peter missing. And even though this wouldn't explain much in relation to the title of the movie (is there really any point since it is doubtful this can have a sequel),  it would ensure that the fear factor remains with the ending and that you are left completely shocked as to what just happened. Not gonna lie, I love horror movies but when he wakes up and sees his mother floating into the tree house i absolutely burst out in laughter. 
Furthermore, i expected when he gets up to walk into the treehouse some form of a ritual towards Paimon that would go with the flow of hereditary, Annie and Peter mating infront of all the occultists as was similarly done in Wrong turn and Children of the Corn would IMO make for a better understanding to viewers of the film rather than just proclaiming him as the king and putting a crown on his head.",8pg2ma

This movie knows how to compose a fucking horror shot. It knows how to make horror imagery scary. It's not jump scares or smash cuts. It's seeing something in the dark and thinking ""What the fuck is that?"" and not wanting the lights turned on, even after you've figured out what it is, just because you don't want to see it clearly.

There are scenes in this movie where I was simultaneously not breathing from fear, floored by the acting, and stunned that something this fucked up was even playing on a screen in front of me.

People in my theater were nervous giggling. A little like the nervous giggling after a lesser movie's jump scares, but it was even happening in the slower scenes, just because of how much the movie was getting to everyone.

The movie is very dragging for me to watch, some scenes are overly dramatize that it gets too boring for me to wait on what will happen next. The movie could be run shorter(about 1 1/2 hrs) and still be a decent movie to watch. Since some scenes are long, the thrill becomes bland and unexciting which turns me off.

I checked to see how far into it we were at one point because it had felt like a long time had passed and not much has happened and we were just under an hour in. Everything felt misguided to me. Reminded me of the Nic Cage film Knowing. In Knowing, everything felt like it was going smoothly but then it was as if the writer had written themselves into a corner and just said ""fuck it, blame aliens"". This felt much the same where it felt like a cop out ""blame a witchy demon cult"". Didn't find it scary or anything. The one thing that got me was the death of Charlie and Annie's reaction to it. I'm a parent myself and I'm likely to outlive one of my children due to a heart defect. So that actually got me and my wife welling up a bit. That was about it though. Overall I'd probably give this a 4/10. Higher than the Conjuring for me but much lower than others in this genre of ""possession thriller"". To me the best of the modern possession films has been ""The Last Exorcism"". ",8pg2ma

That seems to not have bothered anyone else and it didn't ruin the movie for me, but I would've preferred to go in expecting a really good movie and exceeding my expectations than to fall short of such a high reaching level. 

Again, fantastic, some pretty spooky stuff... It was a really phenomenal drama for the first half and then turned into a horror, which I was fine with... But...

When Annie told Peter that she never wanted him and tried to miscarry him was great but had absolutely no impact because it ended up being a dream. After that the movie was slow and then the paranormal shit starts happening. Personally I thought most of the possessions and leads up were pretty cliche. Like Annie on the walls and flying all over the place was funny. People were laughing the theater when she shot up into the tree house.

When Paimon went into Peter’s body it almost seemed like he was waking up or regaining memories of who he was. Did Paimon know who he was when he was inside Charlie?

It seems weird the grandmother would keep a scrapbook of her Satanic cult parties. 

I don’t really like that the director has said the cult caused Charlie’s death. Even if they put the deer in the road, getting Peter to swerve at the precise angle and speed for Charlie to hit her head speaks to a level of power/control that would make a lot of the rest of the movie unnecessary. 

The cult’s entire plan would have been nulllified if the mother had flipped through the photo album before she met Joanie. That seems like a huge risk if your goal is summoning a king of hell. We know they had access to the house since they put the grandmothers body there, why not take the photo album?

What was up with the dog? You see him like three times and then he's just randomly dead. Maybe there was more with the dog and it got cut out?

No idea why the father burst into flames when she threw the book into the fire.

Where was Paimon hanging out between when Charlie died and when he took Peter's body?

The casting of Peter, purely from a visual point of view, felt off to me. I don't know this actor or his ethnicity but he looks vaguely Turkish or something. I wasn't buying he was the offspring of lily white Toni Collete and Irishman Gabriel Byrne, I was wondering whether he was adopted or if Steve was his stepfather for the first half of the movie. He gave an outstanding performance, though.",8pg2ma

e0qou2t,"Ok, my take on this movie is different than most descrived here.  I feel like mental illness was the main theme.  But I feel like the directors made the film ambiguous enough that there’s two movies there depending on which storyline you believe, and that’s the brilliance of it.  

Here are some clues:

1). During some periods in the movie, Annie’s clothes are like the uniform patients wear in a psych ward, as is her hairstyle. 
2)  When she went to Joan’s apartment, the interior of the building looked like a hospital.  
3). Her husband was composing an email to someone and he wrote “I feel like Annie might be having another of her...”. I think that may have been either a family friend whom he can discuss her mental illness with.
4). The weird orb and blobby line that Peter, Charlie, and Annie saw was their brains failing them and the mental illness getting worse.  When Charlie saw it she wandered it to a field where she hallucinated and saw dark images.
5) Peter worsened his mental illness by smoking weed.  
6). Peter not only carries her genes, but he is repeatedly traumatized by her behavior.  In the end, he witnesses her commit suicide, and that sends him over the edge.  

There are many elements throughout which are hard to tell if they are real or not, but that is what mental illness is sometimes like for those with severe psychotic illnesses.  One must constantly analyze their reality in order to determine what is real.",8pg2ma

I kept telling myself that all the set up was leading to something and the third act would be worth it... But it wasn't, the third act is where the film. completely falls apart for me. 

The climax and the lead up to the climax of the film were the  most generic 30 minutes of the whole entire movie.
Even tho I was bored for the first two acts, they were still enjoyable to watch and felt originalish...The films ending was like countless other modern horror movies but films ending felt the like the same ending as The Witch..(it kinda look like it too)

Hereditary is a well crafted movie with everything but its story that just feels like ot really didn't go anywhere new or interesting... The movie feel so generic and has such a generic ending when it really builds itself up from the trailers and general buzz around the movie as being something bigger and more original.( it was supposed to be ""this generation's Exorcist"") I guess I was expecting more and by the time the end of the movie came around I was trying to hold back laughter from how stupid things had gotten...

Did the lady that showed Annie how to speak with the dead force her to intentionally come and The curse would then be transferred onto Annie like the book? Who’s body is that in the attic?

Her screams when she was calmly talking about going to the store and then she found Charlies body as the camera zoomed in on peters face his reaction and the entire sequence gave me chills it felt so real, and Peters reaction to the accident.

A lot of the horror elements very forced and hackneyed, without any real coherency with the rest of the movie, especially with how crazy it ramps up at the end. I was constantly thinking, ""But why is this happening?""

I was instilled with a sense of dread at the beginning, which was capped off by Charlie's sudden death, to where that dread slowly dissipated. After that amazingly disturbing scene of Annie finding out Charlie died, it never reaches those heights again. The pace is unforgivably slow and when the payoff is so cliche and anticlimactic, it felt like it wasn't worth it.

e0vts7w,"I think I was a victim of the hype.

Couple things to mention:

I don’t really find most demon and magic/witchcraft/christian mythos type horror scary or believabls, as it does far too much silly handwaving. A few do the proper due diligence to be unsettling. This film was not one of them, but it could have easily been.

I’m pretty picky about horror films in general.

“The unknown” in this film (which would be the scary thing) is all trope based, and expected of how these things work. The surprise or shock is maybe that you get two tropes hitting you early instead of just one early then expected. [(Grandmother and child both dying)](#spoiler) when usually it’s juts one of these elements a film will deal with.

Lots of things lifted from rosmeary’s baby, exorcist and other films in this genre. There’s nothing new to see here in tropes.  

The execution is good though, and if I had my expectations in check I would have enjoyed this film so much more.

There is nothing really new in this film, despite people calling it refreshing and new.

It’s basically just an updated/modern version of tropes we have seen many times in the last 40 years. I don’t feel it added any extra layers (for me) and left me with the same eye rolls at not thinking through some tropes that are just accepted in this genre, and are long over due to think more about.

It is a well made film, and with some tweaking I think something scary and better could have been made (for me, as I realize it scares plenty of people as is).

there is some good indirect subtle story telling in the details/dialogue, that I respected. Not just symbolic.  Many critics of the film call it overly artsy fartsy, and I thought it was not too weird or artsy, any more than a lot of modern mature horror films have been(i.e. they aren’t aimed only at 20 something/teens). 
This is not twin peaks by any stretch of the imagination.

If you want to see a truly weird ‘brave’ ‘horror’ movie, see something like “God Told me To”. - It’s pretty old and rough, but is far my genre defying and stranger, and expands the genre’s it touches on in interesting ways (I thought). 

 Although I can’t say God Told me To is a better film over all, it’s just a lot more interesting than rosemary’s baby remade with some remixing here and there.",8pg2ma
e0w65ke,"Just saw this film. Superb. It's a film about inherited schizophrenia yeah? Annie mentions her brother was a diagnosed schizophrenic and that's why he committed suicide and a person's chances of developing schizophrenia are much higher if a parent had it (I suppose this is why the film is called 'Hereditary').

So Annie's mother was a delusional schizophrenic that socialised with other people with mental health issues that thought they were Satanist mages or something, Annie was also a schizophrenic and so were Charlie and Peter.
The father was the only one that never had anything crazy happen to him in the film because he was not blood related and had no inherited mental health issues.

The film presents the characters delusions as supernatural events. It's possible that Annie's mother was not actually a Satanist at all, but that that was just in Annie and/or Peter's head.

In which case it's a film not about Satanist possession, but about the schizophrenic delusions of a mother and/or son leading to the death/murder of the parents and the complete mental breakdown of the son.

I would need to watch it again, but this is 'The Shining' level stuff, both in terms of quality and depth of metaphor (if we take The Shining as a representation of the breakdown of an alcoholic with some added mental health issue).

Borderline cutting corners to make everything work with a flat explanation at the end, ineffective build up for me... Not sure if it was the characters or setting but for the end result of 20ish minutes of somewhat scary moments it was just okay for a movie that ran over 2 hours long.

e0d9v9a,Did anyone else perceive the final scene as Peter having an extreme delusion of grandeur as a symptom of his schizophrenia?,8pg2ma
e0dq5l9,"I loved the film and have maybe a different view to it than most.

This movie seemed to me to be about mental illness and the affect it has on a family (as well as how it has been shown to pass down from generation to generation, hence the name Hereditary). Early in the film when Annie is at the grief meeting she talks about the personal tragedies in her life -how her father had a mental illness and starved himself to death, her mother having dissociative identity disorder, and I believe her brother had a mental illness as well.

In the beginning of the film most people would think Charlee is the one who inherits the mental issues that have plagued her family for years, but in actuality the one most at risk was Peter, the brother. I’m not a doctor and I’m not well versed in mental illnesses but he is a teenager, which would be about the time when symptoms of something like schizophrenia would start to appear. What I think triggered this was when he accidentally killed his sister. From there he dissociates and breaks because he can’t forgive himself or accept what happened.

What happens in the movie, in my mind, is him slowly breaking from reality and eventually having full blown hallucinations and delusions of grandeur (the whole king of Hell thing). Whether his parents are truly dead or not I kind of think is left up to interpretation. Maybe they’re still alive but he thinks they can’t forgive him and they are basically dead to him because they want him out of their lives?

Hopefully this makes sense to someone I’ve been thinking about it for a while and I just feel the specific call outs of mental health issues early on means a lot when interpreting this movie.",8pg2ma
e0rcifj,"Hereditary was a tense and thrilling watch, but I would totally understand if the viewer reactions are divisive. It was going the way I would have loved its plot and themes to go for awhile, and then changed course. In an ideal world, it could have been my perfect horror movie, but I don’t think the director had the cajones to go with the ending I would have loved, sadly. Still a great watch.

The weakest point of the movie is that it basically went with The Witch ending. By that I mean, you have a ton of suspense and thriller etc, but it’s still relatively grounded, and although we do see “supernatural” stuff happening in both movies, you could make a case during the first two acts that they are either delusions or mental illness etc. They led Toni Collett’s character on this arc of mental illness, with the background of her mom’s own instability, and various scenes where it could have been a demon or it could have been her being an unreliable narrator and just seeing things. Had they stayed that course and used the supernatural as bait and the twist was that she was schizophrenic and had DID, then this movie would have been perfect in my eyes. It was the first movie in awhile that seemed to have been going for that ending despite being billed as a cliche possession movie. They easily could have explained the son’s delusions as either him also having passed down mental instability, or him having sympathetic symptoms from his mom’s illness.

Instead, they pussed out and went with the supernatural/demonic possession/“the devil did it” cliche. The ending was still fun, in a surreal and abstract way, but it was still a sort of cop out.

e0dgwxh,"Just got out of the theater, and I've got some thoughts. Spoilers all below.

So I think this film draws two obvious comparison. The first on a tonal level is The VVitch. Both films set up this psychological family horror where you don't know whether these strange occurrences are supernatural or just in the heads of the participants. Likewise, both films take a turn in the third act where it's stated explicitly that the events taking place are in fact supernatural. While in the VVitch that reveal was refreshing in its lack of ambiguity, here it feels unearned and in my opinion detracts from the film, as it was the real life horrors that were the most effective part of Hereditary - not the stories of seances and ghostly possessions. 

On that note, the other film I could see this compared to is Drag Me to Hell. That film delights in its campiness, and in just being a literal story about a demon it works on that pure simple level. Hereditary though tries to walk this tight rope between being a metaphorical reflection of grief and anxiety and a literal story about a demonic possession, and ends up dong both worse than if it had just chosen a lane.

And I think why I find the third act so disappointing is that the film was so great up until then its allegory. You had this motif of decapitation that was maybe a bit on the nose, but even still a pretty good metaphor for mental health, grief, (postpartum) depression and survivor's guilt. You had these chilling set pieces of death that were so much more effective and terrifying than yet another demon lady crawling on walls. Compare it to a film like It Comes at Night that reflects on fear and paranoia, while being content to let the monsters remain the humans. I wish Hereditary would have had the strength in its convictions to do the same.

And this film is so well crafted that it upsets me that the supernatural elements are executed so poorly. I think a lot of it comes down to a plot that is just told poorly. I'm all for not holding an audiences hand, but so much of the conclusion of the film revolves around 1. The dream sequence where the mother says she tried to miscarry Peter 2. A 30 second shot of text in a book about this King Padeum demon lord and 3. This underwhelming revelation that the mother's friend who showed her the seance was a friend of her own mother's. I think most audiences' confusion rests squarely at the feet of the storyteller here. This is exemplified in the expository ADR during the final shot. It was painfully obvious that that was mandated by the studio after they realized that movie itself hadn't done a good enough job at doing the one thing a movie is supposed to do - tell a story.

**TL;DR:** Hereditary tries to be an allegorical psychological horror about death and grief but also a ritualistic ghost film about spirits and the afterlife, and ends up being both poorly through an excessively abstract plot.",8pg2ma
e0kncr2,"Maybe it was just me, but I felt a whole lot of nothing with this movie. Not only did I not really care about the plot, or the characters, but during the first half of the movie, where there wasn't much going on, I was so bored I almost fell asleep. And I am absolutely not anti-slow pacing, but there's a difference between slow paced and boring. There was nothing going on visually to keep me interested while the characters were killing time grieving over the grandma. 

I see people praising the cinematography, but honestly, it just felt like I was watching a vlog. There was no real tension for me, honestly.

However, I just feel that once the overt supernatural elements came in, it went a bit silly. I found myself trying not to laugh because it just seemed so fake that it took any scariness away, and the whole satanist cult part was poorly written I was kind of confused as to what was even happening.

The only thing at all I would change would be ending it about 30 seconds earlier. After we have the shot from behind him, and pan from the grandma to the mom, then back to his face, I would’ve cut to black.

It just took me out of the movie temporarily as I was trying to reconcile the dates in my head because I find it difficult to believe the events like the grandmother's funeral and Charlie's death and funeral occured within two weeks (Joan also mentions that she recognizes Annie from the support group from ""a few months back"" which was presumably was right after the grandmother's funeral.

Not the best timing for me to see a final rewatch as I've recently lost my contact lenses and won't get new ones before end of the week.  If anyone else is doing a rewatch or seeing it for the first time, I'd love to know the following:  1). Does the door to the funeral home have no actual latched door, no hinges, and is Annie's car the only one outside in the parking lot that we can see?  And related: is the door shaped like the top of a keyhole?  2). When we see Peter's room for the smoke he does before he gets the text that tells him to bring his dick to the party, WHAT is playing on his radio?  Very bizarre info session as I recall.  3). Still can't make out the Spanish words done by the translator when Annie goes to her first group session.  I've looked up every way to say ""i am a burden"" in Spanish and none are what I'm hearing.

e0xt5lh," To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hereditary. The horror is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the visual cues will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Annie's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the frights, to realise that they're not just scary- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Hereditary truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the apprehension in Charlies's existential catchphrase ""cluck,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ari Aster's genius wit unfolds itself on their movie theater screens.

e2qrort,I thought it was shit,8pg2ma
e0dc5ou,"Well directed with some great performances but I think this is pretty overhyped the more I sit on it. The ending is a bit too generic and, if I’m being honest, a little problematic. Recent horror hits like the Babadook and Conjuring films were much better IMO. 

But again, the direction and acting were so good. The techniques used in the last bit of the movie were brilliant. Everyone in the theatre were on the edge of their seats freaking out when he wakes up and the mom is up in the corner. ",8pg2ma
e0deh18,"I understand that this is an unpopular opinion, but I didn’t think that hereditary was that great of a flick. It started off really well for me. The scene where Charlie hit the pole got a lot of responses similar to “God DAMN” and it caught me off guard. And when Peter just left it and drove. I found that really disturbing and real. I also really connected with the mom/son argument. 

However after that the movie seemed to drag a little for me. Nothing very exciting or eventful happened. I found myself wanting for a horror scene to happen (which I think is the opposite of how you’re supposed to feel in the middle of a horror movie). At this point I was still slightly immersed in the film, but during a quite moment one of the people sitting behind me hit the decline button on his chair and it made a squeaking sound that pulled me into reality. I think another main point where I felt less immersed was when the mom said she was going to see a movie. It made me realize I was seeing a movie. 

It was hard to immerse myself again because it seemed uneventful . I was getting there when the mom was in the corner. I thought that was a nice touch and it was cool to see the audience as they spotted her. However, when peters back was turned she did this weird crawly thing out the door. I understand that it was supposed to be creepy, but to me it looked like someone doing a bear crawl on a green screen. At this point someone in front of me rhetorically asked: “Spider man?” And I’ll admit I couldn’t help but laugh. This took me fully from the movie and made the movie seem a little ridiculous and unrealistic up to the point where the Mom was banging her head on the door fast. I found it funny like one of my moms low budget films she would buy for Easter. I was stifling it as much as possible, and soon collected myself. I know that it was rude and I am still a little embarrassed. I don’t usually laugh at horror movies. I watched “IT” and left with sweaty palms, and I thought “A quiet place” was fantastic. I don’t know whether something was up with me tonight, the film or a little of both. I read that there was laughter in other theaters, so maybe there is a certain mindset you have to be in to watch this movie, maybe it is the movie itself, or maybe I need a little more maturity.

More highlights of Hereditary for me were: the Charlie character, the indie vibe, and the cult stuff. Also I liked that there were little no jump scares. That was new for me. The whole thing felt untraditional and I liked that it was more grisly than scary. Some of the shots were phenomenal. For example: the light switch night to day, and some of the Wes Anderson symmetry stuff was killer. Also if I was in a cult I would make all my cult friends door mats with their names on them. Oh and I really liked all the puzzle price details in the dialogue that added to the plot. The more you detail I noticed the more enriching the whole narrative was.

Also could anyone say why the dad caught on fire when the book was thrown in the fire? I thought it was supposed to be the Mom.

Total score 4/10 mostly for being a little boring for my taste and not keeping me involved. I may have also come in expecting it to be like the conjuring, which might have thrown me off, but I’m sticking to my score.

Sorry if there is bad grammar or spelling, it is late and I am about to sleep. However, I don’t think I’ll be having any nightmares.

e0glgqy,"Idk. The acting was definitely amazing. I think they had the right crew for this movie. I loved the foreshadowing throughout the entire movie, with Charlie cutting the birds head off and then her getting decapitated, and the symbol on the pole that took her life. But this movie was such a slug fest. I checked my phone after 12 hours and 45 minutes had gone by. I just wanted. Something. To. Happen.

AND SECOND -- was Joanie even *in* the Grief Counselling scenes? It was so fucking disorienting how she said she recognized her from group....but you never even see Joanie in the group to begin with.

But then it turned into this shlocky occult shit I thought we were gonna get. The ending is well executed and set up for sure, but I liked it better as an atmospheric family drama with some creepy shit. All the demon king stuff was cool but kind of clashes with the more family centered focus on trauma. I liked it when the movie was about how we figuratively pass our demons on to our kids, but when it became literal it was very uninteresting. Well executed, and very much worth seeing.

e0dgxvj,"I feel like an asshole for being ""that guy"" with movies like this, but it really is so puzzling for me to see so many people working out the occult explanation for details in this movie when I think it very much is just the product of delusions on the part of Peter and his mother. 

The idea of mental illness being the titular Hereditary seems to be at the forefront of this film. It's not like, a throwaway side-metaphor. The husband was the only one unaffected by delusions -- because he married into the family. There are details like the mother being unable to burn Charlie's book and end the ""haunting"" because it burns her, too. The clear metaphor here is almost ham-handed -- to move on from someone's death by destroying their memory is to destroy a part of yourself, too. 

There are obviously supernatural elements to the film, yes, but it's significant that they don't really ramp up until after Peter and his mother have suffered from enormous trauma and grief. Yes, the grandmother *was* involved in a cult. But the actual supernatural abilities of said cult is ambiguous. The line between reality and delusion is blurred. To attempt to engineer a magical explanation for every single weird thing that happens in this movie, in my opinion is counter-intuitive to what it's actually about. ",8pg2ma

 I absolutely only saw this because everyone said you'd shit your pants and it looked well made, but it was a bit of a bamboozle.

e1p3454,"Quick thoughts (didn't like it btw):

* I was with the movie up until immediately after Charlie's death. That was a wonderful scene but everything after was actually laughable (and laugh I did)

* What does the title mean? What runs in the family? The cult thing? That was just the grandma.

* Diorama motif didn't mean anything and didn't go anywhere, only seemed to exist to excuse interesting shot choices like the final shot and the instant day-night cut later in the film.

* Why did Joanie go to the school to yell at Peter to ""get out""? What was she doing? Wasn't she part of the cult? Why was she warning them?

* Sick exposition dumps at the end, couldn't just let me enjoy the weirdness for what it was and didn't have the competence to convey the exposition in a more seamless way

* Really? Spooky seance? Plot-revealing album? Skeptic being skeptical even in the weirdest of circumstances?

* There was an audible *thunk* whenever the movie shifted from exposition to horror, or should I say, an audible cluck. Terrible.

* Was Charlie possessed by Paiman the entire movie, up until her death? If so, why would a demon of knowledge knowingly eat nuts which would threaten his vessel? And it's not much of a demon when his vessels are weak to allergies and telephone poles.

* Why show us Annie smashing the attic door with her face floating on the ceiling? Peter doesn't know that she's smashing it with her face (and iirc that she can even float). It's only showed because the *audience* gets something out of it.

* Anyone notice there were way more cultists outside the house than there were in the treehouse at the end? Are they just chilling outside waiting to bow at the feet of a severed head idol?

* Why would Grandma write a note to her daughter (who might not even see it) explaining that the suffering would be greatly rewarded in the end if Annie's death was going to happen anyway?

* Why bother tormenting Peter in the house? What was the purpose? Is scaring him necessary for possession? Then what explains Annie? or Charlie?

* Annie smashes her face on the door then teleports through the ceiling anyway, which is again just something she does to spook the audience.

* The grandma's corpse was in the attic...why?

* Why would Steve hide the desecration of Grandma's grave from Annie when Annie herself admits she isn't broken up over Grandma's death? It's not like he's hiding it from his kids.

* The face-smashing that occurs late in the movie is bizarrely low-key for so far into the plot. Horror movies are typically supposed to gradually grow in intensity, but this movie just quickly dips its intensity with a smack-smack right before the finale.

* Sleepwalking subplot unnecessary and didn't go anywhere.

* Dream Annie telling Peter her regrets regarding him while alternating between telling secrets and covering her mouth gasping reminded me of The Bye Bye Man, which was very entertaining

* Seance scene was comedy gold, my theater and I couldn't keep it together

* Table argument scene was great but the fact that it's a horror movie kept me from getting into it. I wasn't focused on the personal drama going on in the scene, which was great, but I was just waiting for the movie to *cluck* back into horror mode.

* Film wanted its less in-your-face creepy stuff (guy smiling at Charlie at the funeral, grinning Peter reflection in the classroom, fire outside the house Charlie goes to, the aforementioned excellent 'Annie discovers the body' scene) but also pulled shit like spooky seances, magic flying housewives, the piano wire thing, nightmare sequences, and jumpscare birds. You can't have your cake and eat it too, movie. Well, you can, if you pull it off better, but you either couldn't or didn't.

* So, the seance was actually a ritual to summon or make a pact with Paimon? Then why was creepy stuff happening prior to the seance? What did the seance cause that wasn't already happening?",8pg2ma

e0sdkmr,"Hereditary was shot well throughout the movie however I felt that the ending was mediocre and embarrassing. You would think a serious movie about serious family problems would decide to stick with the same tone throughout and not just fucking over the majority of the plot at the end. I felt that it was lacklustre and lacked passion. The actors were mixed with Peter being very unpredictable in certain scenes however the mother was portrayed in a great light due to the slow deterioration of her mental state which also left the audience guessing if what was happening is real or if it is in her mind especially when you hear her family’s backstory of mental illness and disorders.
Overall I think this movie was too long for its own good.

e0ig5qd,"I enjoyed the movie, but I felt like it was trying too hard to be clever and had too many elements - my MAIN gripe being with the backstory/sleepwalking of Annie. If someone has an explanation I would genuinely like to hear it, because it felt cheap to me. 

I don’t understand why they included the sleepwalking at all. It added to the tension between Peter and Annie, and the illusion that she was crazy rather than this being reality, but other than that... it didn’t serve any real purpose?  When we realized Charlie was a literal devil (which I called from the first time I saw her, props to the actress), they missed a REALLY GREAT opportunity. I thought that the reason she doused then with lighter fluid would have been because she somehow knew Charlie was evil, and was trying to kill it. But then it went nowhere? She was just.. crazy? And if it WAS because Charlie was evil, they have no explanation of how she would have known. Additionally, why was she flying around - why did she try to kill her son? Why did she kill herself? Possession? Fine. But there’s NO explanation of who possessed her - we know it was Charlie the first time, but she was scared, and why would the king of hell possess Annie? WHY? and are we meant to just accept things at face value? She claims to be a medium, which I thought was real fuckin presumptuous of her. Joan never claimed to be the medium, just that the spell and candle allowed her to communicate. So if Annie really WAS a medium, we just... believe her? With no context? Because this crazy woman SAYS she’s a medium? 

It started as a movie about mental health, and then was ghosts and possession, and then was a demonic cult with a flying mother thrown in for effect... it was all over the place for me.

e0cnl9c,"Hereditary bugged the shit out of me, but my daughter liked it.   Combination of strained woodsy family drama (Ordinary People shit, though Utah plates were seen) and a cult thriller/horror movie (the Believers, Rosemary's Baby).  It looks great, great performances, some effective sequences.  But the absurdity of a lot of the cult stuff/Troma level actual events are not worked hard enough into the family part, so noone seems to be living in any recognizable world \- there's a credibility gap about what's going on that is too wide.  It made me very uncomfortable that the aftermath of what happened to Charlie had no believable components other than family strain and depression (no reaction by any other human beings at all).

It's full of Ari Aster's preoccupations from his short films like insomnia/sleep disturbance, use of needlepoint, stuff seen from windows, conceptual art made from twine, dangerous objects and animal parts, and preternaturally fucked up relations between parents and kids.  The ending's sheer ridiculousness coincided with C\-level efforts to do exploitation shock, some of which made me laugh out loud (it always takes longer to saw your own head off with a wire saw than you think it is going to).  The go\-pro\-like shot use was better in Upgrade for Christ's sake.

To be nicer, the movie is great to look at and has some great choices and unexpected avenues taken, and Toni Colette is terrific.  The way the kids look gives them some kind of atavistic charge and at times I really got off on the disassociation from the dioramas expressing almost dizzying psychological trauma.  But it was waaaay too long, especially to get to *that* ending and there were a lot of laughs of derision (""come on!"") at key moments in my theater.

I just don't think its anywhere near as effective or original or as smart as most people claim for it to be. Most of the characters I find to be unlikeable and most of the moments that are meant to convey dread come off as unintentionally humorous. I also found it to be 30 minutes too long with scenes being dragged out (most of which aren't scenes of dread.)

It just was really unsettling and honestly amazing for that same reason.",8pg2ma
e0q9mdl,"

I saw this last night with very high expectations and ended up kind of hating it. I think a lot of why I hated it was because of my theater experience, the entire row behind me was talking, making jokes about every scene and laughing at the movie the entire time. When I left the theater I was just bored and pissed off. However after having a day to think about the movie, I don't hate it, I just can't say I liked it.

There was some things I liked in the movie, the cinematography was great. The movie looked really good and there was some great shots in there. I liked the beginning and everything up to where Charlie lost her head, and then I liked the family drama stuff after that. But after a while nothing was happening and I was bored to tears. Then when stuff did start happening none of it was scary or creepy or anything, just looked kinda dumb. Like when his mom Spider-man crawls across the wall for example. I don't need jump scares in my horror, in fact I kinda hate them, but I do want some scares at least and this movie severely lacked them and the ones it did have were lame. To be fair I did like some of the visuals though like his headless mom flying up into the treehouse and her hanging herself and cutting her head off.

The end was awful, just more satanic cult stuff, like we don't have hundreds of movies about that stuff anyway. That whole speech about Paimon was just bad and stupid. I thought the movie was going to be smarter than that, that it was going to be about mental illness and how it's passed down, and in a way it was, but then nope, turns out it's just a satanic cult.

I've seen a lot of talk about the acting and honestly I don't think any of it was that good. Toni Collette was really good at times, but at other times she was just over acting way too much. I'm sure it can be hard to act so distraught convincingly and not seem like you're over acting, but I've seen it done before . The son was bad, at times he was okay, and at others he was just awful. Does that dream sequence with the worst cry acting ever ring a bell? I've seen little kids fake cry better than that before. The dad was a non-character, he didn't do anything and was barely in the movie.

Overall it's a movie with some good things, but the bad outweighs the good for me. Too boring, not enough scares, horrible ending and way too long. I will watch it again at home when it comes out on blu-ray and see if my opinion changes when I don't have people mocking the movie behind me the entire time, but we'll see.",8pg2ma

Just got done watching the film. I enjoyed it, but the hype wasn't what it was made out to be... for me at least. The plot was meh, but the characters were great. I have a strong interest in slow burn horror films because the characters drive the plot that have been rehashed time and time again. I've seen films involving witchcraft, psychological suspense, cult satanic rituals, family death and they all seem to lead down the same road so it was somewhat predictable overall. Here is the thing I didn't expect: early killing of the daughter. Her cutting off the bird's head was one thing to notice as a hint, but to see her hitting that pole was wow... I can't believe that actually happened. As a horror fan, I loved it. Once I figured the cult was to blame, I just lost interest, loved the imagery, but the ending.. could of been better. ",8pg2ma

I figured out fairly early on that one of the kids were going to die soon, but I figured it'd be Peter. They did a really good job of hiding Charlie's death in the trailers.

Also, the plot reminds me a *lot* of Paranormal Activity 3.

I do hope that Alex Wolff will keep getting really good roles, though. I've been a fan of him for awhile and I think he's really talented, so maybe this will be his big breakout.

e0e3yg7,"i have **a lot** to say about this movie. it loved it. my only complaint about the movie is that it wasnt very subtle, at one point they literally have what is happening written on a wall. other than that, no complaints.   
  
the biggest thing i liked about the film was that it can have a lot of discussions go along with it. for instance, in my opinion, Charlie wasnt real. Peter was Charlie, his symptoms of schizophrenia started happening after Charlie **literally** lost her head. the mother grieving over the loss of Charlie is the mother trying to cope with the fact that her son is showing symptoms of schizophrenia. it would also be a reason why the mother would suddenly wake up after sleep walking and why she had no idea what she was doing, because those moments before Peter had woken up and his mother was in the room were all part of Peter’s delusions.   
  
i think that if Ari Aster can top this or make an equivalent film, he will easily go down in history as a horror master the likes of Dario Argento or John Carpenter. also, really hoping this movie sets a standard for the horror genre. all the scares were authentic, there were no jump scares. it was things that were done with fear of the unknown and assaulting the audience with horrifying imagery that just stick in your head. right now im putting at an 8/10 (or a 4/5). going to see it again soon and it might get bumped up to a 9/10 (or a 4.5/5).",8pg2ma

e0w2q5b,"Regarding crying;

Crying is not unlike laughing and vommiting, not as in they're intertwined but more in the singular sense of each.

With laughing, the weakest of the three, we can say; guffaw, chuckle, snicker, belly laugh, screaming and so forth but in all truth laughter is signature to the laughee.

With vommitting it's the same,, one might project, spew, chug up, kvetch and so forth,, but intruth, vommiting is about as singularly intimate one can be of thereselves without choice.

With crying, one might snivel, wail, sob, drone or weep, gasp but it really is the truest signature of ourselves that we'd like to hide but might creep out in public like a funeral or while witnessing a joyful reunion at an airport or a new birth. However, for the most part and like vommitting, we have no control or can forsee how our bodies might release either. We can't say ""... at the party later, I'm going to vomit while posed like Grace Kelly sitting on the Chez Lounger in Rear Window or like Robert Duval taking in the air on a beach in Apocalypse Now."". Crying falls into the same area and you can't say how you would cry as your mother fine saws off her head while floating above you shortly following your staggered discovery of the charred remains of your father amongst other things like decapitating your sister because you grabbed your bong instead of an epipen.

4). Take another look at the house.  There is no flower bed into which Peter can jump.

5). The crown that's put on Peter's head at the end is in the treehouse from the very beginning.

6). The only person who thinks Joan is real is Annie.  

7). None of the kids at school, including the dude dealing dope at the party ever ask about or give condolences for Charlie even when they see Peter at school.

8). The grandmother died on April 3rd.  The mail invite for the seance was on April 18th.

The trigger was his sister's death and the guilt that came with it. He begins to experience psychosomatic symptoms (begins choking like Charlie), and then hallucinations (weird light, hearing noises, smiling reflection) and his behavior in the final classroom scenes also resembled other lesser known symptoms of psychosis/schizophrenic break. Annie is probably still responsible for Steve's death, but what if Peter was the one that decapitated his mother. He experienced it as a supernatural event because it was too traumatic, then posed their bodies in the treehouse to worship him.

e0q5lqp,"The movie was called Hereditary...and could’ve shed so much more light on the idea of mental illness being impacted by your family history. 
BETTER ENDING: 
Because of Annie’s hereditary (family history of psychosis, depression, suicide, guilt, blame, etc.) she started to lose her mind because of the trauma associated with losing her mother and her beloved daughter within weeks of each other. She had a horrible childhood and toxic relationship with her mother so this leads her into sleep walking again, and becoming mentally ill herself. 
Her son, along with the legacy of mental illness of the family and his own toxic relationship with his mother, on top of the trauma associated with Killing his own sister, becomes mentally ill as well. 
Either Annie or the son actually are hallucinating everything that’s happening, or it’s happening within Annie’s sleep walking, and they actually end up murdering the dad. 
This happens all the time when a seemingly normal person commits a crazy, horrible, violent act that leaves people guessing why it happened. 

Just think this would be a better ending and shed more light on the idea of mental illness running in families than the actually ending of the whole cult summoning a demon thing. I thought that was a bad payoff to a good movie. ",8pg2ma

It felt at times that bits were missing or things were changed in poet production. The whole bit where Annie explains how she is the only one that can stop the hauntings came out of nowhere and made it seem like there was a scene shot where she learns some sort of rule but they cut it out.

There were two occasions when Joanie speaks and it sounds dubbed. First, after the seance where she tells Annie everyone has to be in the house when she does the seance, it seemed like the word “house” was dubbed. Then again when she is explaining to Peter / Charlie that he is a demon. 

Peter’s acting seemed a little OTT at times.

So either during that time Annie died and the mother went to a couple 12-steps, or an entire year and a couple weeks passed rather than just two weeks alone.

Why did it take this approach to taking over Peter as opposed to taking over him from Charlie's death? How does Annie get possessed when it required that Peter die for him to be possessed?

e0oj606,"SPOILERS AHEAD!

SPOILERS AHEAD. I can't get the tags working correctly.

I've finally figured it out--or at least come up with an explanation that I can live with, that I've not seen elsewhere, and that resolves all inconsistencies.

In doing so, I've made some assumptions as alluded to in the link below. That is, that the director is someone who spends a lot of time meticulously putting together a shot list. It sounds like the director, production designer and the DP went through a shot list for five hours a day for three weeks prior to production.

[http://collider.com/hereditary-interview-ari-aster/](http://collider.com/hereditary-interview-ari-aster/)

There were also not one, but two editors, overseen by Ari on this film.

So I assume that every shot--at least visually--was meant to be in the film, and in fact was put there purposefully, with care.

If I make this assumption, then the explanation that I have of the film is as follows below.

The entire film takes place from the viewpoint of someone who we never see directly, who has dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia. Each of the family members, including the grandmother, and later, Joan, are the personalities trying to take control over each other and thus the host body (that we never see). The house parallels the mind.

In particular, note from this Psychology Today article: ""Possession-form identities often manifest as behaviors that appear as if a spirit or other supernatural being has taken control of the person."" [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder)

The pattern of the film is also correlated with the symptoms of schizophrenia:

[https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml)

With this explanation, all of the inconsistencies are explained. The shoes, in the house, and who wears them, indicate which personality is in charge.

The shoes in the house and who wears them are indicative of the personality trying to gain dominance. When more than one person in the house wears the shoes, as all three family members do at the dinner table scene, they are all vying for control.

If you listen carefully, the person in the treehouse blowing ""steam"" at night when Peter was inside on his bong is Annie.

When Charlie leaves the house and walks outside without her shoes, she's trying to get out, to die. When Annie comes down to grab her, she doesn't see the fire that was in the meadow ahead that Charlie saw, but just chastises Charlie for not wearing shoes outside. Charlie responds that she wants to ""be with grandma"", i.e., to stop existing as a personality. I posit that on the trip to the party, what occurred there and what happened after were all meant to be by Charlie, at least on her subconscious level, as she wanted to ""be with grandma"" and stop existing. Even Annie, after Charlie dies, wants to be with Charlie, and we see her earlier on the floor hysterical and saying that she wants to die. Indeed, by the end of the film she gets her wish and she does.

By breaking out of the house, and jumping out a window in the attic, landing face down in the flower garden, emerging unscathed with no new cuts or blood, and going up into the transition treehouse outside Peter takes some dominance of the host body, with Joan also working on the machinations with her strong voice over at the end.

Let me know if you have any questions on these or other details.

To the opposing statement that says that Ari said in an interview that he put Paimon in purposefully--I don't buy it. I see that Ari is following Darren Aronofsky on twitter, and if we learned anything from the marketing scheme for that film, it was not to give away too much information by explaining away the movie. I believe Ari learned from that experience and provided an explanation that was sure to throw everyone off and this explanation does not jive with his and his crew's purported work ethic.",8pg2ma

It was boring. The hints of creepy during the movie weren't enough to keep me engaged. The creepy music with the up close face shots were there... but then nothing would happen. Then it was the next day and la la la we're moving on. The apparition in the beginning was crazy... but then we didn't see it again.

The trailers making it seem like it was about the daughter is frustrating. 

I just found myself asking ""why"" about everything. Why is this king important? What is he supposed to do? Why wasn't the firstborn being a male good enough? Did it have to be the second born? Why? 

The son was a total fucking moron. Him crying during the first time they called Charlie and screaming ""Mommy"" completely took me out of it. His entire demeanor and the WAY overused slow camera pan annoyed the shit out of me. Every single one of his movements is slower than molasses on a cold day, except suddenly he knows to run away fast as shit? How in the hell did the mom suddenly be able to fly? And we're expected to believe the son ran so fast, that he could climb up the attic stairs and be that far ahead of a flying possessed demon, to close it behind him and lock it? 

I can deal with a slow burn. But this was so damn slow and uninteresting, by the time we got to the last 5 minutes of crazy, I just didn't care. It wasn't spooky or creepy anymore because I lost all interest. Oh well. At least I used MoviePass.

IOW, if Charlie on ocassion would float about the house, then the last need of pure fright to send you over the edge and into the peonies aint going to happen.

Scenario; Annie has friends over for a few hands of contract Bridge.

Steve: ""I'm going to make myself a drink, anyone need a bourbon?""

Friend 1: ""I'll have one neat, thanks. will you be tippling too Annie?""

Annie: ""No, I've been nursing a migraine and an awful run of anxiety attacks, depression, night terrors, sleepwalking, you know, regular unstable wife shit.""

Friend 2: ""How's Peter, haven't seen him much?""

Steve: ""up in his room blasting the chronic.""

You know how the quiet place was supposed to be about taking care of your kids and sacrifices for their well-being?  I thought this movie would be about dealing with loss and a message not to dwell in the past.  I think the movie could have been completely done by making it all in the characters heads as they're driven to madness by the guilt and despair.  But once Annie threw the book in the fire and her husband caught fire, I rolled my eyes.  It was just so ridiculous.  And the movie was so slow moving.  Not long after that I stepped out and read the rest of the movie on my phone to see how it ended, and came back for the piano wire scene.  It lacked consistency and was just all over the place.

Everything I didn't like about this movie

It's an hour and a half of nothing and then 30 minutes of kinda something

The mother is a complete cunt the entire movie and never redeems herself

The ending is unsatisfying as fuck. Cool so his family was murdered by ghost spirits so he could be transformed into king of hell or some shit? Yep sorry, but that ending was not worth the build up.

Is it bad of me to say when the sister died I was kinda relieved I wouldn't have to watch a special needs girl be awkward the entire movie?

Having kids when two of your siblings killed themselves due to mental illness and your own mother having mental illness that drove them apart. Hey I know we should have kids so that way we can make being insane a family tradition.

Why does this little girl have an affinity for fucking chocolate? Never explained, in fact I'm 90% sure no thought went into it and it was only chosen because chocolate sometimes has nuts in it and kids being allergic to nuts is super common. Hey here's what pisses me off too, this is literally the first time in my entire life I've seen something about putting any kind of nut into a chocolate cake.

The dad was the only likeable character. From shutting the mother down to protecting his son. Man I was really rooting for this dude to divorce her ass and take the son away. But then the ending had to happen so they killed him off. Cool there goes the only likeable character in this entire movie.

Good on whatsherface for an incredibly good performance. I could just feel the rage building in me when she doesn't understand why her husband won't believe her. 

When Peter is in the attic and it cuts to the mom hanging, I almost laughed out loud from how ridiculous it just looked. Same thing with her busting her head on the attic door. It just looked so bad it was laughable.

I'm going to keep adding to this and anyone here is free to disagree with any of my statements, just please for the love of god give good reason for why I'm wrong for believing what I wrote. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But the way the slow burn is executed is just so bad because absolutely nothing is happening during it that was keeping me invested in it.

e0dejz5,"I just didn’t find myself immersed or emotionally invested in this film at all, particularly as none of the characters were at all sympathetic or (with the possible exception of Annie) whatsoever engaging.

Contrast with Babadook, where at least you could find yourself sympathising with the main character - an overworked single mother who’d lost her beloved husband and became a shell of her former self - and her precocious, lonely young son trying to pick up the pieces.

Here, we have:

Annie, an enigmatic but bland woman who (right or wrong) basks in her victimhood from a traumatic upbringing, delivers a strange and awkward eulogy for her mother,  has a strained and dispassionate relationship with her husband (despite proclaiming him the “love of her life”), and is cold and distant toward her children, whom she barely tolerates.

Her husband, whose name I cant recall because he’s such a boring and forgettable character and seems oblivious to the psychosis festering in his house or just doesn’t care very much.

Charlie, a bizarre character whose very purpose seems to be making the audience uncomfortable. Cutting off a bird’s head wasn’t scary, just disgusting, and seemed to be solely for shock value.
Personally, I was more annoyed by the stupid clicking noises than unsettled or “scared” by the kid. 

Peter, a slack-jawed and one-dimensional stoner who stares into space for half the film. I couldn’t care less whether he got possessed or whatever, it could only make his personality more interesting at that point. I actually thought things were looking up when his reflection in the glass smiled back at him. Finally, a new expression!

With introductions of the supernatural and occult came unexpected goofiness.  Even the performances were hammy and bad as time ticked on.  I found myself looking forward to its conclusion which at times was amusingly horrific (Joan yelling at Peter during recess, a body randomly floating up to Charlie's tree house, Peter hitting his face on his school desk, etc...).

Was Annie ""in"" on raising the demon or not? Was it assumed she was controlled by her mother through her sleepwalking? There wasn't really any specific moment where she turns ""evil"" but then suddenly, after Steve's death, she's just a fucking demon-witch climbing walls and flying through the air. Uh... how?

The actors, the set designers, and the screenwriters are all clearly doing an A\+ job, and then they trip at the finish line with putting together a compelling story. There were many, many lines that the director could have chosen for the final act of this film, and they chose maybe not THE WORST one, but certainly one of the most pointless. The mother's struggles mean nothing, her character means nothing \- she just gets run over and then decides to go with her mother's crazy plan. The rest of the family has no agency at all. It becomes clear that a cult is trying to reincarnate a demon, and then they do. Compare with ""The VVitch"" where you get the payoff at the end that the witch in the forest is part of a coven and the infighting within the family has been orchestrated by them the whole time in order to bring the teenage daughter to satan. It's a bleak ending, but each of the characters gives it a college try, the reasons for their decisions are obvious, and the conclusion feels earned. It reminds me of the final act of Law Abiding Citizen, where the idea people got lazy two thirds of the way in.

e0dd0yd,"For anyone who has seen The Witch also may have noticed that Hereditary is the exact same copy movie. Both produced by the same company makes sense but its the EXACT same movie. Maybe not scene for scene but they both follow the same tropes. The Witch and Hereditary are horror movie twins the way Star Wars Episode 4, and The Force Awakens share the same structure. Spoilers ahead but bear with me I've not seen The Witch since it was in theaters. Hereditary starts with the death of grandma, The Witch is the (assumed) death of their new born. Which is quickly undercut by the sudden death of a child in the family, the daughter in Hereditary, and the son in The Witch. The family is slowly torn apart by unspecified yet demonic forces that only one increasingly hysterical character, Mom in Hereditary and the Daughter in The Witch, helplessly try to convince their families of exists. The same unknown antagonist manipulates the family over time in both movies, in an attempt to discredit the character trying to get to the bottom of things. Both have the same ending, of the obvious reveal that, in The Witch Black Philip is a vessel for the devil and grants the daughter the power of the devil. As does in Hereditary the Son becomes the vessel. And both end with a sudden and somewhat deflated ending of a satanic ritual in progress. I know I had a lot more examples the other night when I was watching Hereditary but they escape me at the moment. One last thought both movies never let the audience know anymore than the characters do which I think does help it in its overall cause, but anyone who has seen both would also notice the common tropes between the two movies, that they are more than just coincidental, they're basically the same movie shot twice.

e0jvch2,"I've looked through the comments and it seems like everyone on here loves Hereditary, but I have to say I wholeheartedly disagree. I didn't like this movie one bit, in fact I found it to be one of the worst movies that I've paid to see in the theaters in a long time (and I saw Solo: A Star Wars Story the weekend before). It seems that the response to anyone who says they don't like Hereditary is that we're too ""stupid"" to understand or like the movie, but I don't think it's bad because I'm dumb, I think it's just a bad movie. Plain and simple. 

I saw this movie Saturday night with my mom, sister, and my sister's fiancee. Of the four of us, all of us agreed the movie sucked. The theater was so packed that we ended up having to split up and I sat next to my mom. We both sat there checking our phones and watches throughout much of the movie wondering when we would finally be spared from seeing anymore of this snoozefest. Seriously, there was an older man sitting next to me, and after sleeping for much of the first half of the movie her finally got up and never came back, to be honest I wish I'd done the same. I knew the movie was a little over 2 hours, and I ended up spending about the last 30 minutes of the film counting down the minutes until it was over. 

I've also seen comments about how people in the theater were laughing and cracking jokes during the ""scary"" and ""intense"" parts of the movie. I don't think people were laughing as a reaction to cover up their fear, at least I wasn't. I, and I'm sure others as well, were laughing because the events happening on screen were just utterly ridiculous. Toni Collette banging her head on the ceiling, Alex Wolff slamming his head on a school desk and running out of the room crying, a headless body floating across the backyard, and old naked people standing around doing hot yoga. These events were not terrifying at all. They were purely comical. 

Yes the acting in the movie is good, not great, and is probably the films only saving grace. Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette both put on good performances, yet she is hardly ""Oscar worthy"". It makes me wonder how badly they each must have needed a pay check. 

The plot is so slow to develop and by the end just makes absolutely no sense. I think Ari Aster got too caught up in writing a semi\-decent family drama that he forgot he was supposed to be making a horror movie, then at the end just slapped together an ending full of scary movie cliches and then tried to tell us that if we don't get it, we don't have a high enough IQ. No sir, you're just a shitty screenwriter. 

At the end of the day, this film didn't make me want to leave the theater out of fear, but only out of boredom. I walked out not feeling terrified, just feeling annoyed and robbed of $10 and more importantly 2 hours of my life. There was a line waiting for the next showing, and my sister's fiancee and I were telling people to turn around and go home. That's how bad we thought this movie was. 

I'd like to hear other people's thoughts. If you agree and think it sucked, tell me what you thought, or maybe someone can explain to me what I missed that makes this pile of garbage a ""masterpiece.""",8pg2ma

Hardly the next The Exorcist. The daughter’s death was so random and served little to no purpose that couldn’t have been achieved by the mother’s death (apart from the shock factor of how she dies, which felt contrived and unnecessary). The buildup was extremely slow with little to no scares. I’ll give credit to the anxious atmosphere the film created in the 2nd and 3rd act, but I left the cinema feeling anxious for a scare that never came. So take that as you may. The 1st and even 2nd act could’ve been compacted, the daughter could’ve survived and the whole cult thing could’ve been explored more to make the make the film creepier.

Cons: Unfortunately, the film is not well paced. I feel like we get the reveal of the supernatural forces fairly early and it took away some of the mystery and tension. Also, and this is obviously going to vary from person to person but there the fear didn’t leave the theater with me. The best horror movies stick with you days or weeks later and this just sort of faded after I left.

e0dzk0n,"I want to like this movie because the acting, the music and all the references in the movie are just amazing. But the movie isn't so much of a slow burn as it is blue balls.

Charlie needed to die or be removed from the screen somehow. She was so weird that it was distracting. She cuts off the head of a pigeon. I appreciate that for fitting in with the theme of decapitation and for the foreshadowing, but on the other hand, why not just hang a sign around her neck that says ""cliche"", have her stare into TV static and mutter ""redrum""? I get that her behavior is needed to tie in with the overall plot, but it completely broke immersion for me.

The last 20 minutes of the movie is supposed to be intense, but the way it's done makes it feel ridiculous.  Steve burning was initially shocking, but now feels like the writers needed a quick way to get rid of him. Annie cutting her head off was so animatronic that I'm surprised that I didn't hear solenoids actuating. The floating, decapitated body leading to the tree house was incredibly cheesy. The ending's just unsatisfying. Everyone in the family is dead except for one person who's now possessed by a demon. Why should I care?",8pg2ma

I'm not crazy about 'it;s all a dream' resolutions but there is no but.  Also the demonic apparation (that light  sweeping over stuff) reminds me of a reflection of light from a swinging door or window.  I'm pretty confident that occurs in the classroom early in the film.",8pg2ma

i have a very important question 
first of all, im a horror movie critic and i specifically requested to review this months ago. haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time
leaving the theater last night i was horrified (in the bad way), disgusted, and pissed

i want to talk about what we all think peter did with charlies body, including why the head was left on the side of the fucking road
even if you think you can explain away his actions with grandma demon magic, STILL:

1 what do you think he did with her?
2 how do you explain that until her dinner outburst, we see peter's parents and classmates acting as if they had no idea what he did

such good writing in the beginning. fascinating family dynamic. then they had annie deliver LITERALLY ALL OF THE EXPOSITION exclusively in dramatic monologues and 10000000 plotholes opened that were never fucking addressed.

Not sure how much longer it will be shown at the theater I went to. Yes this the first time I've been at the movies where less than half of the people left after 45 mins. After the film was over we went to the ticket counter and got our vouchers. 

Sorry but I can't call this film artistic or a deep emotional story about loss that's also a true horror. It's really a low budget film that uses the mystique of not knowing what to expect for far too along and then never giving the audience the payoff for being patient for almost 120 mins. Definitely can't recommend more than a rental. ",8pg2ma
e0ecok6,"My biggest issue with this movie is I don't think real people would act the way these people have to this stuff. Especially the father, especially peter. Annie herself did a lot of stuff that I just can't accept any family would put up with, even after what they'd been through together.   


And then once super natural stuff was introduced to them like that? Nothing about that seemed like a sensible reaction. It's possible any of those interactions in a vaccuum might have been acceptable, but all of it together? Straight up not using information they received 2 minutes ago (or two years ago, this movie was long as shit) and choosing to remain in clear danger. 

My second biggest issue with this movie is the blatant foreshadowing combined with excruciating pacing. I don't give a fuck how ""tense"" or ""unsettled"" 15 minutes of loud dissonance in an empty dark hallway makes people. If you already gave away everything an hour and a half ago you're just wasting my time for nothing.   


So many scenes of character development for nothing. I get it's a pretty horror movie tropey thing to do that to your characters and all. But they took forever. 60&#37; of this movie was Peter slowly staring at things in bewilderment.

Was that meant to be included with the gallery along with the other disturbing creations?? 

""Annie, I love you work! Can you explain what inspired you for this piece?""

Two things on this: (A) Paimon is the demon prince of wisdom and foresight, who can gift all knowledge, secrets and mystery. So yes, they probably could have known. (B) The cultists aren't blueprinting this entire scenario. They're preparing it. The cult insignia on the telephone pole is all the evidence that they were involved.

That doesn't really make it any less ridiculous. To have orchestrated that they would have had to at least 1) predicted annie would force charlie to go to the party 2) planted a cake with nuts 3) planned on charlie not having her epipen 4) known peter would try to drive her instead of calling an amubulance 5) known that charlie would have had her head sticking out the window just as they were nearing the dear they presumably planted 6) known that the car would swerve exactly so the pole would collide with charlie's head.

Also, when Peter woke up and sat up in bed, and it was so dark, with a figure that you could almost make out, that was creepy. It's like when you wake up and you think you see something in the corner of your room. But they left the camera on him with her in the shot up on the ceiling so long that you figure out what it was and then it loses that element that makes it scary.

Then in our theater, people were laughing out loud when she scurried across the wall. Then it got creepy again as he walked through the house in darkness. And the dude in the corner with the big ass smile was creepy. And the shot of his mother on the ceiling bashing her head against it was creepy. But they really take you out of it when they show that shit at the end in the treehouse.

My wife is pretty easily scared by movies, and sometimes has trouble sleeping after a good creepy movie, but even for her, that ending took her right out of it and the element of horror was lost. I feel so many movie makers don't realize that once they show everything, it's just not scary anymore. They've lifted away the veil and revealed unrealistic silliness that ruins it for me. But I guess that's not the case for everyone.

People are talking about this movie and how terrifying it was, and I think it *almost* was, but like many movies of this genre, they take you out of it at the end. Mystery solved. It's just not scary any more.

I really liked it overall, and my wife and I talked about this movie more than any other I think we've ever watched. There were deep layers of messed up crap throughout the entirety of the film, and unpacking them all on the car ride home was fun, so I would definitely recommend it.

It's a perfect example of the filmmaker noticing our voyeuristic need to see it, and teasing us, only letting us see it on his terms.

When she gets hit, you see the impact, but it cuts away pretty quickly.  We know she's decapitated, but the car was in motion, so it isn't particularly graphic at first.  When Peter screeches to a halt, he stares out the front of the windshield aghast.  That shot lingers for a while.  Then we take his perspective.  The camera *begins* to look through the rear-view mirror, but not enough to make anything out.  Peter drives away, presumably in denial and shock, having avoided seeing the gruesome details.

He makes it home and crawls into bed, not sleeping, not telling anyone, and in the morning we only hear Annie's screams.  *Only then*, just when we think we're beyond it, do we see the insect-covered, disfigured face of a 13-year-old girl.

That got to me *deep*, man. Way more than any ahhh it's a spooky demon monster scene in any other horror movies. Like yeah they give you things to be spooked about when you're walking to the kitchen late at night after the movie, but they don't tear out your fucking heart.

I have a little sister. I think I'd kill myself if I was in Peter's position. I just can't imagine waking up, going to school, etc. knowing that I'm the reason my little sister is dead. 

Honestly he's a bit of a cockhead for bringing her to the party. When his mom called his bluff he should have either told her the truth or made some excuse not to go. I felt like I was the only one that didn't feel very great about the 13 year old girl (that looks younger tbh) at the party with some song about pussy-popping in the background.

e0kz6ln,I would say for you to give The VVitch a try.

It's also another A24 movie as well.,8pg2ma

The other movies people go off about not being horror like Get Out I vehemently disagree but still understand why the argument is coming up, but this movie has seances and possession and gore and demons and everything you could possibly ask for out of horror.

For a few nude older people, and a flying decapitated woman. Appalling. The laughter prompted the comedians there to call out things like ""Peter Pan"" which was even worse.

Edit: also did anyone notice how Peter physically looked like he wasn’t part of the family 

Edit 2: does anyone know how the grandmother originally died? I have a suspicion that the friend (who later played the shit out of annie) was trying to sabotage the grandmother so that she could be the conjurer and receive all the riches. I remember her also telling Annie that her son and grandson both drowned indicating that she tried to summon Paimon through them as well ",8pg2ma
e0bxmmj,"I feel like the cult orchestrating the killing of Charlie would make sense, but seems like a huge stretch considering the circumstances. How would they have made it so that she stuck her head out of the window at the exact right moment? How could they have made sure she ate the cake?

e0d4ouq,"This is more or less the explanation I've landed on, with one major addendum -- I think Paimon temporarily possesses Peter (when Ann Dowd 'casts him out,' he sees the lights, then he contorts himself) but the possession breaks when he bashes his head against the desk. I think they decide they need to weaken him more, and Paimon goes from the notebook to Annie in order to scare Peter into jumping out the window, leaving him much more vulnerable and susceptible.",8pg2ma
e0f7qu6,"Some extra things as well. 

•Grandmas husband starved himself probably so that his body wouldn’t be used. 

•Could it be that Annie subconsciously knew what was going on? That’s why she in the past tried to kill Peter with the lighter fluid so that Paimon wouldn’t take him. 

",8pg2ma
e0bqmu1,"oh so that's why she decapitated the bird, it was paimon",8pg2ma
e0f38zq,"I think Paimon only set Annie on fire the first time to keep itself from ""dying,"" and to manipulate Annie into believing the only way she could destroy the book was to kill herself. It probably never had any intention on killing Annie at that moment, since we see later that it needed her as a vessel. I assume the film's title alludes that Paimon can only possess people that are related to Ellen, so Steve didn't really have much of a role other than his death mentally breaking Annie long enough for her to become possessed.",8pg2ma
e0dclfe,Why on earth did Annie allow her mother to breastfeed her daughter???? Like....was that the cult influence clouding her judgment?,8pg2ma
e0n9fjy,"Was Paimon ever confirmed to be real though? All of the supernatural occurrences in the movie only happened to the cult or the grandmother’s blood relatives. I assumed the title “Hereditary” was referencing schizophrenia (which Annie’s brother was diagnosed with) and other personality disorders that are well-known to be genetically linked. The movie had me wondering whether the family was truly cursed or whether they were just suffering from psychotic delusions. The only character that wasn’t affected by Paimon was the father, and he was also the only main character that wasn’t a blood relative of grandma (or a member of her psycho cult). During the family seance, the cup only moves when everyone touches it, and no drawing occurs in the sketchbook despite Annie claiming it happened just 20 minutes before. His reaction by the end isn’t “Oh my god my daughter’s ghost is in this house,” it’s “My wife is having a psychotic episode and is scaring the fuck out of our very vulnerable son.”

The only thing that throws a wrench in my theory is when he is engulfed in flames, but remember that Annie was holding a can of lighter fluid and he had just refused to indulge in what he thought was one of her “delusions”. Given her history, it’s not totally out of the realm of possibility she doused him in fuel and burnt him to death in the middle of a psychotic episode. 

With this in mind, the final shot after Peter’s “crowning” ceremony could also be taken two ways. Is it a deity from hell, now in a vessel to his liking, marveling his subjects who finally brought him back to power? Or is it a traumatized and schizophrenic high school kid who is scared shitless in the midst of grandma’s scary demon cult?",8pg2ma

>Paimon was always within Charlie, but couldn’t take full control of a female host, that’s why grandma wanted Charlie to be a boy.

Charlie's death causes her long-awaited psychotic break, and the son's paranoid schizophrenia is set off by his guilt as well as being the same age as her brother.

When Annie gives the family history at the group therapy, she mentions dissasociative identity disorder, and I'm not positive but I think schizophrenia and depression. I think Peter and Annie have a mental break down and that one of them dug up ""Queen Leigh's"" body. I especially thought so after they explain the paint thinner episode. I struggled to figure out if it was a case of unreliable narrator for most of the movie. When Peter assaults himself in class is what sealed it for me. I don't know which one killed the father but I believe Peter actually killed his Mom by the end as well, and hallucinates the entire final treehouse scene.

Edit: Annie says she was sleepwalking for the paint thinner episode, but I think she was actually in a fugue state",8pg2ma

Probably because the actual plotline itself was something we’ve already seen a few times, and in general the satan/possession thing just doesn’t scare or interest me because it’s so far fetched in my mind. The parts of the film that were straight horror were also borrowed from other films and it really took me out of the experience.

The scene with the mom discovering charlie was truly horrifying, though. As was the son’s reaction to and realization of what he did. Those were the most effective and impactful parts of the film, but I never felt truly scared because it was pretty obvious how it was going to end.

But I ***do*** get scared by some video games (*Outlast*, *Alien: Isolation*, the Clickers in TLOU), so I know I'm not incapable of being scared. Maybe I just need a more immersive experience to actually get scared. It's something I've thought about, but I don't have a real answer.",8pg2ma

During the final scene, when they are reciting the prayer to Paimon, i thought to myself, ""you should not be hearing this.""  I know that's pretty irrational seeing as its ""just a movie"" but it was my unconscious reaction. 


With that said, I'm not really religious, more agnostic. And my knee jerk reaction was to seriously consider saying an improvised prayer after the movie to tell God ""i want nothing to do with this Paimon fella.""  ",8pg2ma

The angles were just fantastic. Seeing the crown get put on Peter's head with Colin Stetson's best song of the whole film was just so incredibly powerful. Stetson's scoring on this movie were absolutely astounding. The grandness of that song, saxophone blaring with that hypnotic refrain, matched with what they were revealing was just incredible.

e59a34z,I thought Peter's reaction was an extremely efficient way to display the family's realization of loss. Peter was in shock. His dealing with his sister's death gave the movie the catalyst to move on. I think it's implied he felt responsible and the explantation for her death was clear to her family and a huge explanation as to why the police were never involved on camera. He didn't try to hide his mistake but rather let the family share the experience he had. Had Peter woken up his parents all the legal and moral implications surrounding his responsibility would have clouded and obscured his family's greievance for their loss. Great decision. ,8pg2ma

e76g2nn,"Interesting interpretation! But, I assumed the point of Peter clicking his tongue upon standing up (shortly after the orb enters him) tells us he is now Paimon/Charlie. 

If your interpretation is correct, then why did he click his tongue? ",8pg2ma
e7115wg,Yes...and DID could certainly explain the dead bodies in the attic.,8pg2ma
e7kx61k,"In order for that to work, Charlie and Peter would have to be having the same exact hallucinations. Also Charlie and the mom both see Leigh, I guess that one is a little more believable.

When Peter gets up after jumping out the window, he clicks like Charlie. Also the Dad, who is the straight man of the movie and doesn't believe in any of the supernatural shit heard Charlie's voice coming from the mom and saw the glass move.

Also when we see the mom banging in the door, Peter can't see her, we are shown that she is on the ceiling banging her head against the door. 

It absolutely could be a metaphor for mental illness but I don't see how the ending could be interpreted as not supernatural from a narrative standpoint by the things we're shown in the film. ",8pg2ma
e6zx6jk,"Wow, I'm very impressed at your interpretation of it. Before the ending I also thought that maybe these were hallucinations because of the passed-down schizophrenia. Your take on it makes sense to me. I'm not sure what was intended! Either way I just watched it and am thoroughly disturbed.",8pg2ma
e7dtwrh,"In any case, supernatural or hallucination, the movie is very obviously a metaphor for congenital mental decease much like ""It follows"" was about STDs.

Which is pretty smart taking a real life problem that's scary on it's own and projecting it into the supernatural. Kind of like how some sci-fi will project a social concept of problem, turn it up a few notches in the guise of showing an alternate reality (""distant future"") and allow exploring the issue.

Except that for a horror movie, it's not just isolating/focusing an issue. It's also taking the real fear of it into a more extreme situation.",8pg2ma
e7lfhth,"That's also my take on ""what actually happened"" in the movie. Considering the family's history of mental illness and the hints given throughout the movie, chances are everything we see from one of the main characters' perspective is unreliable. During the first school scene (IIRC), there's actually a huge poster promoting critical thinking, I think that influenced my train of thought throughout the rest of the movie.

As a sceptic, I tried to find the rational explanation to everything that happened and virtually everything could be explained by non-supernatural explanations, but that would heavily rely on the unreliable narrators through which's perspective the story is told.",8pg2ma
e83zh4w,"My interpretation of the film is that what we see does *literally* happen within the context of the film's universe, but I do think that there's a possible subtext of the kind you're describing that was intended by the creators. I wouldn't say that what happens on-screen is metaphorical so much as the story is allegorical (for mental illness such as schizophrenia). I don't think the selective approach of ""well this actually happened, but this was imagined"" is an accurate way to view the film if the film itself doesn't clearly hint at that being the case, but those are just my thoughts.",8pg2ma

Took me a full minute to gain the awareness and the willpower to reach over and turn a light on. Only then did her image finally fade away from the spot on the wall.

e0h4sf5,Or at least have one in the fucking car. ,8pg2ma
e0d3bu0,"I basically just came to realize that if she did have an epipen then there would be no need for a frantic car ride scene and then no crazy beheading. So to me it's a bit of lazy writing to be honest. The director needed an excuse  and decided to throw logic out the window in order to achieve a great scene. Kind of lame, but whatever. Still a haunting scene. ",8pg2ma
e0fv983,I was so convinced for a while that she didn’t really die. I was like why would they market her so much just to do that. ,8pg2ma
e0fylah,"Eh, it was well done but I REALLY wish they hadn’t decided to show the bit with a certain person on fire in the trailer. It took all the suspense and surprise out of that scene because as soon as she told him to throw the book in the fire I knew exactly what was going to happen.",8pg2ma
e1nk1ey,I thought he did a great job.  Seemed real to me.  He broke out of the 'tough angsty teen' thing for a bit and cried like a little kid.  I thought that was good acting ,8pg2ma
e1jjni9,"I posted this blurb below a couple of weeks back on crying and give it another go. I agree with you;

Regarding crying;  Crying is not unlike laughing and vommiting, not as in they're intertwined but more in the singular sense of each.  With laughing, the weakest of the three, we can say; guffaw, chuckle, snicker, belly laugh, screaming and so forth but in all truth laughter is signature to the laughee.  With vommitting it's the same,, one might project, spew, chug up, kvetch and so forth,, but intruth, vommiting is about as singularly intimate one can be of thereselves without choice.  

With crying, one might snivel, wail, sob, drone or weep, gasp but it really is the truest signature of ourselves that we'd like to hide but might creep out in public like a funeral or while witnessing a joyful reunion at an airport or a new birth. However, for the most part and like vommitting, we have no control or can forsee how our bodies might release either. We can't say ""... at the party later, I'm going to vomit while posed like Grace Kelly sitting on the Chez Lounger in Rear Window or like Robert Duval taking in the air on a beach in Apocalypse Now."". 

Crying falls into the same area and you can't say how you would cry as your mother; fine saws off her head while floating above you shortly following your staggered discovery of the charred remains of your father amongst other things like decapitating your sister because you grabbed your bong instead of an epipen.  That's peters vomit crying moment.  

To quote H.P Lovesauce ""he cried in a way that could never be described in this story.""",8pg2ma
e1fb5dr,"He was too old for the role. I think if the actor had actually been a teenager it would’ve felt right but he was clearly college age and it took me out of the movie. I feel the end would’ve been much more impactful if he had just been a kid and didn’t look like an adult. Great movie, but the role was mis cast. ",8pg2ma
e0bo0sb,"As strongly as I’d suggest against watching the actual film, Colin Stetson’s soundtrack for Rust & Bone was another hit; much more his traditional compositional flare and go-to’s (inhumanly fast baritone sax sixlet arpeggio, with cyclic breathing so it’s literally never-ending, looping pedals & heavy ass reverb). Hereditary’s score was a surprisingly substantial departure, or update, from that. Hope he keeps getting these soundtrack gigs, because there’s only so many ways to use layered detuned violin tones & shrill woodwind stabs...

The soundtrack to most horror movies functions like a fucking laugh track on a sitcom lol",8pg2ma

The accident accelerated the illness for every member of the family except the father because he is not related by blood to the grandmother, and so it is not a hereditary trait for him.

Cult horror has fallen out of vogue in favor of the 'REAL horror' so I think it's great that they led us to believe we would be getting a mental illness horror, and then bait and switch us. But it wasn't a bait and switch because there were clues as to what was happening every step of the way

e0b1naz,"Okay so spoilers for anyone who hasn’t seen it ahead 

1) yes Charlie’s death was influenced by the cult. The book says the demon goes after the most vulnerable of the family members ( Toni’s “schizophrenic” brother accused the mother of putting someone inside him). The demon prefers a male body, so they had to stuff him in Charlie, then kill Charlie (via...black magic fuckery?) to free the demon to inhabit others. Then had to kill Toni to let it inhabit Peter 

2) book burning- I’m unsure why or how Steve caught fire this time, seems like the demon didn’t want him in the picture and by taking away everything precious to Toni she would be the most vulnerable and could be possessed as a temporary vessel 

3) Seance seemed to be fake in order to get Toni to say those words in that language she didn’t know (ancient Babylonian or some shit?). Those words are what opened the summoning 

4) shimmery light was the demon inhabiting them ",8pg2ma
e0b1pwb,"The ""seance"" was a summoning of Charlie/Paimon's spirit back into the house after it was liberated from Charlie because of the decapitation. Joanie set it up, gave the mom (Toni) words which she didn't understand or know but pronounced anyway.",8pg2ma
e0ba7yw,"Everyone is saying the cult set it up but I think the film is deliberately ambiguous about it. Early on in the beginning of the film Peter is in one of those classes where the lecture is talking about the THEMES in the movie. The teacher is talking about tragedies and how they are often the result of the character’s actions. Then there’s a mini debate about whether it’s more tragic if everything is just left to fate and you never really had a choice to begin with.

The rest of the movie plays with this a lot, oscillating between making you wonder if this is all just chance or if it’s the character’s own actions leading them there. The big one is of course Charlie’s death. Is it Annie and Peter’s fault through their series of very poor choices? Was it set up by the cult? Was it just pure chance? Which one is a more tragic and horrifying story? 

",8pg2ma
e0b5teb,"It does seem that her death was orchestrated. Even without the nuts, they would've passed that pole at a decently high speed. The deer would've caused them to swerve and Paimon could influence Charlie to stick her head out.

Joanie was insistent on the whole family being there. It seems all 3 were connected to the book during the seance so the demon could choose who to burn with the book. 

The seance was necessary to summon  Paimon and the light was Paimon.",8pg2ma
e0b0tw2,"Yeah i'm pretty sure her death was somehow caused by the cult. I'm assuming those smiling naked familiars(?) were what put everything in motion from the allergic reaction to the deer in the road. 

",8pg2ma
e0b6v5g,"I was thinking the occultists may have initially believed breastfeeding to be the only method of commencing the Paimon ritual. When Annie wouldn't let her mom feed Peter, they assumed they missed their chance and focused their efforts on Charlie. She was given a typically-male name and instructed by her grandmother to act like a boy. Paimon I'm guessing was within her from infancy, but unable to actualize in a female host. Years later, some cult member could have discovered a Plan-B—perhaps requiring female decapitations—so they attempted a switcheroo to transfer Paimon to his preferred male body.",8pg2ma
e0b21ls,"Does anyone know why they couldn’t just use Peter as a host from the beginning?? They say “we got you this healthy male host,” but why not “groom” him from birth?? Does it have something to do with Annie trying to miscarry? 
(I unfortunately did have to get out to use the bathroom, but it was fairly early on and my mom said I didn’t miss much) ",8pg2ma
e7gmip2,"I think something else was influencing Annie to attempt to kill her children while sleepwalking. Maybe something divine or in her subconscious knew that her children would bring something evil into the world. She never wanted a kid.

In that opening scene are incredible gardens with an out of place series of reddish roses. The whole film goes through all these investigative theories, but agatha knew from what we saw of the estate, that the weapon was buried and their oxidation caused the flowers at that point in the garden to change colour.

As far as the tea drinking scene, I couldnt make out what it was either. It didnt really seem to have relevance in the rest of the scene but still put me on edge haha.

By that I mean that, if you were to take it literally as a posession cult story. The story lines up. 

But if you look at it from the other direction, all the supernatural stuff being imaginary or signs of psychosis, then it does to. 
Mostly because the father is the only reliable character in the family and all the supernatural things are only viewed by the other characters. (The only exception being the seance with the mom and the dad, but again this scene is portrayed from the mothers perspective, the glass could have been pushed and her freaked out reactions, might be the real reason why the dad is freaking out).

If they are just suffering psychosis, I'd like to point out it's well portrayed. Their hallucinations start off minute, seeing,hearing people who aren't there. Refractions of the light, seemingly indicating supernatural significance. And the mother being the only one to see Joan the medium woman (other than the son seeing her in the distance during his breakdown) . She approaches her right after she decides she can't attend the grief counseling, when there's no one around and when she speaks to her in the parking lot, no one even glances at them. Both moments occur as the mother is staving off her breakdown in solitude. 
The son's breakdown increasing in intensity after he's smoked a bowl under the bleachers is also pretty realistic, seeing as thc is a known trigger to hereditary schizophrenia.",8pg2ma

Peter decapitates his sister but for whatever reason he doesn't get possessed yet. I believe it's because Paimon wanted more heads to carry around on his camel. The next morning Annie finds the body and soon goes into a state of psychosis. In her psychotic episode she invited Paimon's disembodied spirit (as evidenced by acting like Charlie during the séance). Since she didn't witness the decapitation she needed to perform this extra ritual to acquire the spirit. Then in the final act Annie chases Peter around just to decapitate herself in front of him, finally allowing Paimon to pass into Peter. Jumping out the window was just a formality.

The question is, where did the crow acquire Paimon from? I am totally filling this in with my own head cannon, but the crow could've been present when Ellen's body was exhumed and later beheaded. A bird would be the best choice for the demon to inhabit because of how mobile it can be.",8pg2ma

e1o3l74,I think you hit the nail on the head with that observation. I read that the director confirms as much. Charlie was paimon since being a baby. The film shows us paimon prefers a male body. The symbol is on the wooden pole. It was marked to be the target to kill Charlie and release Paimon to Peter. It was all work that was laid down by their grandmother long before she died.,8pg2ma

I’m not sure if anyone else noticed but the scene where Annie is in peters bedroom and there yelling at each other as she says she didn’t want him.
If you look at their bodies they don’t move, Peter is almost uncomfortably still as this scene unfolds and Annie stands completely still as well. It looked like they were the dolls and rigid as someone was playing this scene out with them.
Just my opinion though. ",8pg2ma

The mental breakdown of Annie, lashing out at Peter, the father trying to keep the peace in the family, Peter's guilt. It all felt so real and relatable.

e1hht8m,"#Spoiler
I think what people have a problem with is that tone of the movie fit perfectly well for what was happening until the last 20 minutes. Everything felt grounded and real and the suspense was palpable. Every action was was slowly building the tension and making sense.

The problems arise when last 20 minutes loses its realism: 

1) Peter's last posession is him hitting his head into a desk multiple times, but suddenly Annie is crawling across the ceiling like Spider-man.

2) There's a dozen naked cult members in the house and the **(FREEZING)** woods

3) Annie is floating while sawing her own head off. 

All the realism the film got its tension from is absent for the climax. The ending didn't come out of nowhere, it just didn't fit the rest of the movie as neatly.
Personally, I have no problem with the plot and it does get better the more i think about it (you've connected the dots very well, thank you). But the last 20 minutes made me furrow my brows rather than scare me.",8pg2ma
e1gcv1y,"The out of nowhere part was everything with Annie. Why did she randomly become a cultist? How was she flying around all that? How did Paimon enter Peter when there was no ritual? 

It was obvious that the mother was in the cult, and that was why she was obsessed with boys and Charlie, but the Annie stuff was very underdeveloped in my opinion",8pg2ma
e5lhwou,"That was the most powerful scene to me. I couldn't help projecting myself into that situation and wondering what my raw reaction would be. It's too difficult to even try conjuring those emotions.

e0ewlt9,"I like this theory but I think some details don't match with some of the others. It seems like Charlie was always ""carrying"" King Paimon, hence why she was such an odd child. Otherwise why does Paimon at the end have all the traits of Charlie? And Joan refers to the demon as Charlie before calling it Paimon at the end.

 That's the only reason Charlie was Grandma's favorite, and also the reason the grandma wished she was a boy. That's why they say his gender was ""corrected"" at the end of the movie. The mom says that the grandmother was the one who pressured her into having Peter, but she says she refused to let her mom have access to Peter which is why he wasn't the vessel for the demon. She says she did let grandma have access to Charlie as a baby because she felt guilty about cutting her off from Peter and even said the grandma wouldn't let anyone else feed Charlie which seems vaguely suspicious as well.

 It's also why Charlie feels at home in the tree house because it's actually her ""temple"". The mother is the temporary vessel for Charlie/Paimon starting with the seance, hence why she keeps hearing the clicking sound and talks with Charlie's voice. And then when Charlie feels the pains throughout the movie that's part of the cults vudu trying to cast him out of his own body. And in the end of course, the mom dies and the presence finally moves into Peter. 

It's also possible the grandma was possessed by Paimon before transferring to Charlie as a baby too, hence her supposedly having multiple personality disorder like the mom mentions during the therapy session.

 I'm probably missing details here or there though.",8pg2ma
e0etzy5,"My only problem with this is that it doesn't make the entire middle of the movie make sense. If Paimon can just possess Charlie without any sort of seance or whatever, then why didn't he just possess Peter right after Charlie is decapitated? You could make the guess that Ellen somehow hexed Charlie before dying since she was so close with her, but then you start getting into the sort of mental gymnastics where every mistake can have an explanation if you make up enough of your own story, and I think that's cheap. These sort of questions are what make leaning too hard into ambiguity dangerous when writing. Really liked the movie, and I had the same idea as you after viewing (didn't connect the bird, though), but I think there are a few missteps with the script that keep it from being perfect. Another example is how well the movie reads as a manic episode of schizophrenia across multiple generations, but they made the mistake of having the father, Steve, at the seance, and he sees the glass move and candle light itself. This element nullifies the dual reading of the movie, and they should have had the scene only have Annie and Peter to keep that great subtext in tact.",8pg2ma

e0es86m,Brilliant explanation. I think you're spot on.,8pg2ma

e0ugy3g,"Going off of your last two thoughts. Genealogy/inheritance comes up in a few different ways in the film. The obvious is the implication of inheritance of mental illness from Ellen to Annie. This ultimately proves to be a red herring, though I don’t think that actually invalidates it as a theme per se. Through the course of the movie, we see what appears to be Annie becoming increasingly as she described her mother to be: psychotic, manipulative, etc. And we can presume that, outside of supernatural elements, she is imparting this same kind of abuse onto Peter, continuing the cycle. 

One subtle thing I haven’t seen others mention yet is that, in many ways Peter seems to take much more after Steve than Annie. They both have similar features, compared to the three women of the family, and are generally much closer emotionally. (This is particularly highlighted when the mother screams about “that face on your face” while the camera is focused on Steve making /exactly/ that face.) But it almost felt like Peter truly had been saved in some way from the cycle. This, to me, made it that much more tragic when he too began to show signs of psychosis.

Of course everything is revealed to actually be caused by supernatural forces. Personally though, I feel that the movie is most effective when sort of viewed through both psychological and supernatural lenses simultaneously. (Edit: That is to say, trauma, abuse, and mental illness are all definite factors in the film. That the final culprit is a demon king does not remove the real-life horror derived from those psychological elements, nor does it make this movie /not/ a striking depiction of those elements.)

In regard to denial, I think this also has a few layers. Through much of the film, pretty much every member of the family commits some sort of “sin,” and yet refuses to admit culpability. Peter  is most directly responsible for Charlie’s death. Yet, Annie pretty much knowingly forced him to take Charlie to a party that she absolutely should not have been at. Steve kept the desecrated grave a secret from Annie, and failed to respond appropriately to his wife’s worsening mental condition. Basically all of the family tension hinges on this constant denial by all parties. 

Additionally Annie apparently allowed Ellen to do some pretty wild things to Charlie - not the least of which involved breastfeeding. It’s hinted that Annie likely knows much more about the ritual than she lets on, yet she repeatedly covers it up. This verges into speculation, but I think Annie probably witnessed a good bit of her mother’s occult doings, but has deeply repressed them as a result of trauma, and desperately wants to believe that her mother was simply mentally ill. I think she knew that Charlie was meant to die, based on the note from Ellen and all the wall etchings, but denied it up until the moment that she couldn’t. Which is why she reacts so viscerally to Charlie’s death: she’s truly overwhelmed both by loss and by the immense guilt of not preventing what she knew would happen. ",8pg2ma
e0t83nm,"For the last point, on denial, I noticed everyone in the family has addictions:  Steve is addicted to alcohol, Charlie is addicted to chocolate, Peter is addicted to pot, and Annie is addicted to work.  No one in the family ever addressed these addictions head on.",8pg2ma

e0wfez0,"lol he actually said ""what language is even that""",8pg2ma
e115dvv,"So this was actually my favorite part of the whole movie, for several number of reasons. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD

First off, when they're driving and Charlie loses her head, you know something happened, but you don't know exactly what. You know she died, but the fact that she had lost her head was an amazing reveal. 

In the car, after impact, Peter doesn't want to look back. Like he knows the fact his sister is no longer making noises that she's dead. BUT all we see is a small glimpse of the rear view, we don't actually know what Peter sees. However I think he saw her without her head right then, which is why he drove home and left her body in the car and went to bed without sleeping a wink. He didn't go to the hospital or tell anyone partly (IMO) because he saw her head missing. It was like he died inside in that moment.

 Now part of why I believe he did see her headless is due to the fact he has a flashback in his class room and you see a longer lingering moment of her headless body in the rear view mirror (but you still can't quite tell what it is, you can make out her orange hoodie and some red). The second part of why I believe he saw her headless then,  is that when Annie builds the diorama of the car with Charlies head on the ground, we see her body sitting up, against the window, with an arm hanging out, in the back behind the passenger side. The way she was leaning against the inside of the car and the position of the rear view makes me believe Peter saw her right off the bat missing her head which is why he didn't even attempt to go to the hospital. Annie can replicate the scene with the car because in the morning when she went out, she probably opened the drivers side door, ready to climb in, and saw straight away Charlie's headless body sitting up.   


Now why this is my favorite scene. The cut from Peter driving home, leaving the car and going to bed without sleeping, the focus on his cold, blank stare through night until that morning as you hear in the background the nonchalance of his mother talking to his dad about going out, so unaware of what's about what's about to be walked in on, the front door opening and closing, then the car door opening, and that moment of confusion before Annie *just* starts to scream, all in the distance. 

And then Annies scream comes into the foreground full force right as the cut to Charlies decapitated head comes on screen. THAT was just, breathtaking (for lack of a better term). And just Annies blood curdling, heart wrenching screams while she rocks back and forth on the floor of their bedroom, unable to bear the sight of her only daughter headless and dead now burned into her mind, begging for death because she can't bear it, was an amazing performance by Toni. Like, I felt as if she lost her child there. This movie made me feel so many things, and I loved it, hands down. A lot of people may disagree and that's completely fine, but for me, it was astounding.   


I also feel as if part of the reason people didn't like it/the ending was because the occult clues riddled through the beginning were probably missed (I.e. the small black words of latin on all of their bedroom walls, the 'spirituality' book in Annie's mothers' things, ect) or just fell on deaf ears as nothing of importance. To me, the whole movie was leading to that ending and it was still an incredible reveal. 

Anyways, sorry to kinda hijack your comment with this I just felt how you did about Toni and especially about this scene in particular. ",8pg2ma

And religion was a big part... And he wasn't religious at all before hand. Afterwards he became insanely paranoid, he said he spoke to and saw God, and felt his body being pulled in directions that he FELT was because of outside forces. So, while I certainly understand the gripes about that part of the film, I actually saw the ending as the only way it COULD end and bring some sort of closure to the characters, albeit traumatic.

Perhaps the tea was actually some kind of potion?

The words on the walls (SATONY, DEGONY, EPARIGON, etc.) were the same ones that Joan was yelling at Peter when he was eating lunch at school and are typically used in witchcraft when you wish for something to depart. Maybe this was Joan's way of telling Peter's soul to leave his body so Paimon could then move into it?

Peter was also being watched when he was invited to the party, we all saw that symbol on the telephone pole. Plus what high school house party serves cake?

I think that Peter thought he was having an allergic reaction though, because he really does have nut allergies and had never been high before. This interpretation of the movie relies on noticing that the first and last shots of the movie are both of dioramas made by Annie. In the first shot, we see the camera push into the model before the action begins. The movie happens within the model, and is told entirely from Annie’s perspective. We see it established multiple times that Annie deals with personal suffering through her art. This movie is the metaphorial death of Charlie through his transition into Peter, as told by Annie’s dollhouse art. I totally ripped of this interpretation from Nyx Fears on YouTube, btw.

The opening shot established that right out of the gate when it zooms into the model house, which becomes Peter's actual bedroom without cutting away.  

What it means is probably open to interpretation.  It could mean that the whole story was in the mother's head.  She did mention that mental illness runs in the family, so maybe she was delusional.

The demon of king paimon is transferred every time a head gets cut off. This is alluded to in the film with the book of spirits showing him on top of a mound of severed heads.  The movie shows, quite logically, four transfers. Similar to Denzel Washington movie “Fallen”... showing a demon that transfers himself by touch, if I recall.

First, we learn Grandma’s grave has been desecrated (and her head likely removed). This transfers the demon from grandma to the bird we see later in the photo/invoice emailed to husband showing the grave . 

Second, the bird flies into the window at Charlie’ school and she cuts off its head. This is the demon transferring himself from the bird to Charlie.

Third, Charlie is beheaded (after eating chocolate cake that the demon “arranged” to be cut with the same knife used with the nuts...to which Charlie is very allergic).  This and the subsequent seance transfers the demon from Charlie to mom. 

Last, mom cuts off her own head at the behest of the demon. This frees him to move into her son, Peter. The final vessel.

And:

""In humans, induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in some cultures, and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers.

e0xrexe,"1. I felt that the way that Annie told the story of the paint thinner and sleepwalking is where the justification for this hit me.  A mother who stood over her children with a match and paint thinner was complaining about the fact that her family  doesn't accept her sleep walking excuse and that they might still be afraid or untrusting of their mother.  She couldn't say that in group therapy.  A normal person would be forever frightened and mortified to the point that they would commit themselves and never feel safe around their children again.  I felt that was a clinically insane and homicidal elephant that lives in the room with her and the children everyday for the rest of their lives based on the way Annie shrugs off responsibility and empathy for her kids here.  In my head that family went from kind of off to criminally dysfunctional.  They would never discuss it, no one would ever apologize.  If Peter started torturing animals and suddenly there was a serial killer in town, they are the kind of family that simply wouldn't talk about it at the dinner table and continue as normal.

Not to mention also the reveal at therapy of her families mental health history (psychotic depression and schizophrenia is pretty serious).

And she lies to her husband about therapy.  And her husband lies about her mothers grave.  This is not a truthful family.  Peter is a product of that.

I couldn't think of anything to say to my mother in that situation lol or if I could ever look her in the eye again. I think the idea was that he was too in shock after the accident to form coherent words and tbf, it did seem like there was a point between then and the dinner scene that time had passed for a few weeks, maybe a few months, and an apology could have happened off screen in that time frame. Of course, in a movie like this, I doubt that something as important as an apology wouldn't be shown on screen.

It also happened again when Joan was talking to her the second time at the car and again when Joan was giving her seance directions. She said they have to be in the house but her mouth said 'room.' 

I immediately did not trust the grief counselling session as being something that was truly real once I noticed this and of course thought it was Annie's mind, but given the story it makes more sense that Joan/and possible other cult members in the grief counselling circle is the factor here. 

It happened in all the scenes with Joan and the sound design for this whole film was so incredibly amazing, I have no reason to believe it wasn't on purpose. EXCEPT that room/house change is definitely something that a producer would change in post for clarity/to tie up a loophole. 

My friend said it was likely ADR but I still find it strange that it was so obvious. Because this director does like 15 takes to get it right and they weren't on location, they were in a studio the whole time: a very controlled environment. 
It always happening around Joan I think is intentional and a reflection of that character's magical ability/an aspect of mind control.

There’s no way Annie dug up her mother’s dead body and brought it back to the house *and* up into the attic unassisted.

Schizophrenia is a VERY hereditary disorder and the first break psychosis symptoms show up around the age of the teenage son and can first manifest with cannabis use.

I thought the mental illness aspect was there for us to question character decisions throughout and to add tension by being reminded they may just be called “crazy” if they tell people details about what is happening. 

Either way, interpretation is one of the best parts of the experience and it’s awesome that this one leaves room for it after a viewing. If that interpretation works for you, then hell yeah! ",8pg2ma

e0hccik,No. What you see is what happened. ,8pg2ma
e0l1ygl,"I think it was a tactic to make you think your theory was a possibility, but towards the last 45 minutes that diminished and the final part made it a non-factor. It was used to make the occult stuff scarier when it was finally happening.",8pg2ma
e0b6wvl,"I actually was thinking this the entire time myself. Not sure if you noticed Steve's email (when he's in his office) to Annie's doctor. It says something like ""I think Annie is having another large..."" you can fill in the blank there, my first thought is ""psychotic episode"".

Ever since Annie mentioned several of her family members were schizophrenic, I watched the rest of the movie through the lens of Annie and her kids having a psychotic episode triggered by stress, and the death of the Grandmother and Charlie. Although I do have my uncertainties about this theory. For example, Joan showing up early in the movie as she watches Charlie cut off the bird's head. Or Maybe all of the mental health references are all red herrings. Interesting to think about regardless. ",8pg2ma
e0ivdw9,"I agree 100%!! How about the wardrobe choices towards the end of the movie when Annie has really lost it, she absolutely looks like a psychiatric patient in scrub type pants and a long coat. Not to mention that ""Joan's"" apartment hallways looked like a psychiatric inpatient unit. Absolutely amazing movie.",8pg2ma
e0pec18,">That's why Steve never sensed Charlie in the living room - only Annie and Peter did. 

Steve did notice though, thats why he threw a glass of water in her face and looked physically disturbed. He also witnessed the glass move. 

>The combination of stress with the art gallery and losing the daughter brought on the schizophrenia in the mother. She even admitted to having it and ""sleepwalking"" to the extent that she almost immolated her son.

While she and her son were definitely traumatised and broken down throughout the movie, the general consensus is that the sleepwalking was a subconscious effort to kill her children before they fell under the control of the demon. As she had covered both children in the paint thinner and tried to set them on fire LONG before any of the events of the movie and before her mother had died.

As another comment mentioned, we also see all the cultist stuff inside Joan's apartment, which only we, the audience, get to see. Therefore it is grounded in reality and the cult is real. Now had the mother seen it, you would have grounds for it being in her head. But as it stands, I'm not seeing anything to suggest the cult wasn't real despite mental deterioration definitely playing a strong role in the movie.",8pg2ma
e2drlo7,"Yeaa I kinda thought this was obvious when watching the film, but it seems like you are the only one here to identify this. This is why it is called hereditary. It’s about passing on mental illness and that is why she did NOT want to have kids of her own, she was super resistant because she knew her families history. 

And a lot of the symbolism deals with 100% psychosis, seeing lights, feeling of grandeur (thinking you are a god or king), hearing voices or seeing things, being forgetful and acting on impulse, coming up with elaborate internal theories or conspiracies. 

I’m honestly shocked it’s not more understood here... even the symbolism of the constant decapitations, losing your head... it’s in your mind and it’s the only escape.

The dad was the only sane one, if you look at the scene when he died from that perspective it’s not him trying to burn a book, it’s him trying to calm down the mom from setting him on fire. She’s mentally insane at that moment and he’s freaked the fuck out.

The end also clearly represents being in a psych ward with the walls closing in and the crazy people around him, fully achieved mental capacity with his “crown”. ",8pg2ma

e0dly8m,"Dude, it's all about the quiet buildups and lingering suspense. Horrors especially rely on you to be fully immersed to get the desired effect.

I've waited impatiently for this movie to come out since I saw the trailer and read the reviews months ago.

Excited to see it today is an understatement.

5 minutes into the movie four waxy, middle aged sluts in stilletoes waltzed into the theatre with red wine in hands, talking loudly and laughing whilst the rest of the cinema was in total fucking silence.


They then sat down, one of whom puts her whory red high-heel cladded feet on the back of the chair of the row in front. What middle-aged woman thinks that's fucking appropriate.

These cunts laughed when the film was tense and suspenseful, talked during important dialogue throughout the course of the movie and generally just fucked over the experience for everyone else. 

My wife could see I was getting visibly frustrated with them and quietly whispered ""calm down, don't worry about it"". 

I obliged until about 80 minutes into it until I could take no more. 

They started laughing again as Toni Collete is chasing ""Peter"" into the attic.

As the rest of the cinema gave a disgruntled but polite ""shhhh"" I finally had to lean my head round and shout ""SHUT THE FUCK UP, FOR FUCK SAKE!!"".

These cunts, who in all honesty looked as though they all would've been smoking hot in their day, clearly are not used to being spoken to like that by anyone, let alone a guy. 

Nobody just gets a pass on piss poor behaviour because they've attractive. Fuck you, and shut your fucking mouths you selfish, self-centered pieces of shit. 

P.S if you eat popcorn like a farm animal or rustle your candy wrappers during a movie you're a total fucking cunt.

e0i0uh8,"The circular nature of the cult members appearing as early as the funeral, and the Paimon\-centric details hiding in the house (and Grandma's cameo in the darkness seven minutes in) make it obvious that the mental illness angle is meant to be more of a cloak/misdirect. It's all real \- Ellen's DID was Paimon possessing her, her brother's schizophrenia was from failed possession attempts, Annie has latent mental illness from her childhood/upbringing around the cult and Peter inherits the curse from her. He also suffers from PTSD from his mother's possessions and/or lucid attempts to end the cycle, depending on how you view the ""sleepwalking"" episodes. It's only because the film makes the cult text instead of subtext from very early on that the mental illness angle falters.",8pg2ma
e0i25gy,"To me- I get both sides. There are some things that can easily be explained by science (psychology, in this case), but I think there's more. Ellen was, no doubt, a controlling and abusive mother, but she was also a powerful medium. I later realized that there's symbolism and hints to Steve's blindness - aka he doesn't have the ""sight"" because he is not blood related to Ellen. This is explained during the seance (during which Steve remains skeptical, but Peter asks how he cannot feel the ""air flexing around them""). Also, when Annie walks into Charlie's room to find drawings conjured on the pages, they are pictures of Steve (the friend I saw it with thought it was Peter) crying (as he did in the car taking Peter home from school after his possession/self harm episode) with his eyes crossed out, which indicates blindness (or a lack of sight required to participate in spiritualism).

e0d4kmu,Mine too. There was a group of 3edgy5me teens in the back row that kept laughing at the creepy parts...,8pg2ma
e0d96ac,I had a bunch of assholes making Charlie's click noise at the quiet parts and their dumbass friends laughing at that.,8pg2ma
e0d4vsz,I don't really watch trailers but I saw the quick one before another movie. What was misleading? I know It Comes At Night was marketed as a horror though it was more a psychological thriller.,8pg2ma
e0gutqg,"It’s a horror film not a scary movie, you know what I mean? It’s a different type of fandom, definitely caters to a certain taste.

e0gzrf6,"I had a similar experience. Emotionally immature kids who laugh at super inappropriate times. I think if I'm gonna see another movie at night it will be at the Alamo Drafthouse so if they make noise they get kicked out.

e0kukyh,"Ultimately, I like your explanation, but it's also meant to have multiple interpretations. It is very similar to The Shining in that way... we see supernatural things, but the entire film could be reimagined to be Jack Nicholson's slow decline into insanity. Like a lot of great movies, it can be interesting and fun to explain multiple ""realities"" in the same film.",8pg2ma

e0l1tmv,"All the supernatural stuff was real. You're initially led to believe this is about mental illness but no, it's truly about supernatural happenings.   


If this was all in Annie's mind, why did the camera focus on the sigil carved into the pole? Who is that for if not for the audience to notice and connect with the necklace Annie's mother wore and the drawings in the book? Why would we see the blue light into Peter's body in the end? ",8pg2ma
e0kxu50,"These were my thoughts leaving the theater. Lines up perfectly. I even think joanie may be a con artist trying to scam annie, which tricks her into believing all that seance stuff is real, which she in turn tries to convince her family is real.

I didnt even consider the idea that the end wasnt some fever dream until reading about the film after.

Some good points made here regarding the cult theory though... I do think both interpretations are valid.",8pg2ma

There were a bunch of funny parts, I laughed a couple times, but during times when it is completely silent this group kept doing these super ""laughing at the movies"" stereotypical laughs. About two minutes into the movie I heard a ""Oh hell no, walk away"" and knew it was going to be one of those movies",8pg2ma

e2gunym,"I agree, it went from intense and audacious to over the top and forced.  Still damn good.  The scene in the tree house is incredible, but the stuff leading up to it is to scattered and forced. 

Its a minor quibble.  So much great stuff here, the performances, the mood, the overwhelming sense of dread.  That shot of the car lights in the dark expanse of nothing gave me chills.",8pg2ma
e4rs6cv,"In retrospect, that scene where Annie forces Charlie to go to that party against her will is kind of hilarious - bearing in mind that Charlie is actually this mighty Paimon demon.

In fact, thinking about - Paimon, an ancient King of Hell, had to exist for 13 years as a 21st century American school girl...that's practically a sitcom.",8pg2ma
e4r21s8,"To this point, if Charlie (Earthly name) was Paimon from the beginning, then what now? Peter is Paimon, what happens next?

[Also, what was with the naked family members and people?](#spoiler)

I have so many questions!",8pg2ma
e4u669d,"No, I believe the grandma was hosting the demon until her death where she was then dug up to be decapitated to release the demon. The demon then went from pigeon to Charlie to mum to Peter. All but Peter were decapitated. Charlie is also seen with the lights (which represent the demon outside a host and having not possessed a new one yet).",8pg2ma
e5n9uud,"I think the thing going on with the miniatures was a reflection(metaphor?) of her futile struggle to have some control over her life when it was already completely orchestrated by the dead grandmother. Every event of the movie was predestined and there was nothing the surviving members could do to stop it (The mark on the telephone pole, Joanie's interventions, the cultists).",8pg2ma
e5mxdyy,"Also quite obsessed with this movie. I’ve rewatched it numerous times, and I’ll still get the image of Annie in the corner or banging her head on the attic door in my head, it’s really unsettling. ",8pg2ma
e5lpqp3,"Yeah, you may be on to something there. There is also the sound that Charlie makes that is oddly like mimicking a flicked switch. The movie starts and ends both with a kind of dollhouse shot.",8pg2ma
e5m8f4o,"Good point. It makes me think as if Annie, was orchestrating the whole thing as a game. Playing with her toys.. doing evil things to her toys",8pg2ma
e0bfd83,"The occult stuff was definitely happening. That's why the audience gets to see the inside of Joan's apartment but Annie doesn't.

Wait, what? When was this?",8pg2ma
e0bgr7x,"I don't remember Charlie ever eating nuts, I remember her eating a chocolate bar and her family being cautious asking if it did have any, but that's about it",8pg2ma
e0breo2,"Charlie had a picture in her room with birds on it also.  

And I saw her weird doll making as something a girl would do to be like her mom.  Did the grandmother teach Annie to make dolls?",8pg2ma
e0darv9,That next-to-last shot where the decapitated mom and grandma are kneeling in front of the effigy with Charlie's head is permanently seared into my psyche now.,8pg2ma
e0edwcr,I was also getting some Annihilation vibes! The soundtrack put me in that mindset as well. ,8pg2ma
e0dgeke,"I don’t disagree there is some underlying commentary about mental illness, mainly with Annie, but the counseling scene where she mentions her father and brother are plot seeds that show her mother tried summoning Paimon before and failed. Her brother wasn’t schizophrenic, he even says Ellen was, “trying to put people inside him.” He had been possessed and used and killed himself so Ellen couldn’t summon Paimon. I think the implication is similar with the father. ",8pg2ma
e0dfzh0,Absolutely this. It's definitely an allegory about mental illness (and possibly grief triggering it) wrapped in a witch cult plot.  ,8pg2ma
e0dtbhv,"I agree with you completely.  I think the title of the movie, Hereditary, sort of hints at that.  It's being passed down from generation to generation.",8pg2ma
e226w0j,To point 4. I think Joan said that they all needed to be in the house for it to work. Not necessarily involved with the ritual.,8pg2ma
e20dln1,"The 16yo som killed himself and blames his mom for trying to put people inside him, which of course in the horror narrative is literally what she was trying to do. Allegorically its blaming his mom for his inheritance of illness.",8pg2ma
e1xjuk6,"Adding on to your 3rd point, the scene where Annie is digging through her mother’s things, (cult photo album) she picks up a mat that says “Charles” and “Peter,” which the grandma had made for them.",8pg2ma
e1xp98c,"Listening to the soundtrack right now, horns actually show up pretty often in the soundtrack. ",8pg2ma
e2150sd,"Great points.

4. She said everyone needed to be in the house, not necessarily part of it. When Joan said “they need to be in the house” her mouth said “room” so they must have changed it in editing. I agree with the tied to the book thing, very interesting.",8pg2ma
e0b9ix0,"The general public doesn’t digest arthouse films. Modern horror is straight to the point with characters that explain everything and jump scares throughout the movie. Maybe only certain people are made to enjoy slowburn films like Hereditary or maybe modern movies have ruined general audiences from enjoying them, maybe both. ",8pg2ma
e0b9aai,"It’s going to be a very polarizing film, much like the witch. Critics will love it and the general public will loath it and claim it’s too slow and didn’t make any sense. People like me and you on the other hand are fortunate enough to see it for what it is, a masterclass in suspense and slow burning horror that leaves you with things to think and talk about for days after. ",8pg2ma
e0b9aan,"Our theater sounded like most if the people hated it, too. My wife and I really enjoyed it. The slow building, dramatic tension was great. Not a lot of cheap jump scares. I fear this is going to get the ""It Comes At Night"" treatment from the general audience, because it wasn't anything they were expecting.",8pg2ma
e0bpbrx,"I thought it was a vision at first, but it must have been her dead grandmother.  And then I guess they stuck her in the attic afterwards",8pg2ma

e0bmmx1,I also want to know this.,8pg2ma

e0bttze,Not a film for mass audiences. We need more movies like these. Keep it up A24. ,8pg2ma
e0bsldw,"Must be because this is more of an ""artsy"" type film. This was my first arthouse horror film and I loved it",8pg2ma

It was more of a ""oh, now I understand""

I literally thought she was just a nice lady ",8pg2ma
e0cv4su,"During the eulogy at her mother's funeral, Annie mentioned seeing a lot of strange faces.

e0ddzig,"1) Do we know for sure that paimon was inside Ellen? The photos with her in some kind of ritual that almost looked like a wedding (her white dress) and then the frame that said Queen Leigh gave me the sense that she had maybe ritualistically married the devil or maybe paimon and in doing so accepted the role of bringing paimon into existence/finding a human host for the demon. Also, paimon can inhabit a female, but prefers a male... Joan confirms this at the end during her voiceover when she apologizes for Charlie, the “imperfect host.”

2) I wondered about the security camera too... I take it as a sign that Joan is part of something much larger (IE the coven). That they are literally behind the scenes orchestrating events and watching them play out.",8pg2ma

e0dfjh6,"1. Like others said, Grandma only gave Paimon the vessel, not became the actual vessel.

She has a look of letting go/relief/all-around-evilness once the dad is revealed to be burning.

e0f376w,">  Maybe a deleted scene can answer?

Yes. In the script, Annie's mother feeds baby Charlie herbs in her bottle. The speck Annie drinks is probably the same kind of herb. ",8pg2ma

e0guq6g,"I can see where you’re coming from BUT I do think decapitation is important to the ritual, her death was orchestrated in such a way for a reason. Ellen’s decapitation, Annie’s decapitation, the bird etc, and depictions of Paimon show him wearing a belt adorned with 3 severed heads. 
The nut allergy thing is a bit strange, some people said the m&m’s she was eating came from a yellow bag. So maybe the allergy was manipulated by Paimon’s presence in her body, which could explain Peter’s similar reaction under the bleachers after Charlie’s death...
So many layers!!",8pg2ma
e0gv82o,"Paimon was trying to end the entire family aside from Peter. He didn't want to be a teen girl with a disability, a middle aged woman, or an aging male. He wanted to be young man. He did his time as a woman by living a full life as the grandmother.",8pg2ma

Re: Annie's artistry. I don't know if you got the chance to read actual occultists' accounts of Paimon. Whether one believes in it or not, it's interesting considering that occultists say Paimon is known for knowledge and art. Annie does miniature figures. Charlie does peculiar-looking toys, strange bricolages of the world around her, Annie's mother was into knitting. So is Joan. So, clearly, art and crafts is a thing in this world.

The beginning shot, apart from compelling us to think whether this is actually happening or just a thing in Annie's head, is also one way to see the film as an elaborate ritual set by the cult to destroy the family. It's something that Aster also touches upon in his interviews.",8pg2ma
e0jeejs,"From a Variety interview with the writer/director:

**There is nothing Annie can do to stop this from happening?**

No, I don’t think so. That’s where the dollhouses came in. Annie creates these miniature figures and dollhouses and they served as a perfect metaphor for the situation; they’re dolls in a dollhouse being manipulated by outside forces. Any control they try to seize is hopeless.",8pg2ma

At the end, her photo hanging up said ""queen ellen"" .When annie was talking at the meeting, she described her mothers family members dying, her father starved himself to death and uncle killed himself because, he said the grandma was ""trying to put people inside of him"". It was pretty clear the grandma was trying to summon this demon and was successful when charlie was born, (even though it was not the prefered vessel for the demon ),thus the photo of her being showered in gold and made queen. What I found interesting was the note annie found in the photo album from her mom that said something along the lines of ""the sacrifices made now will be worth the reward"" so...to me, that could mean 2 things. Either there is an afterlife and all this real world shit going down means they will live rich afterlives, or the reward is just the fact they summoned this demon and get to participate in that, and nothing else. Great movie, cant wait to watch it again",8pg2ma

This will sound weird maybe, but windows during daylight scenes and the way light shone through them--as if all goodness and knowledge and maybe even a happy ending were on the other side if you could only get there--was very reminiscent of the way windows were lit and shot in The Shining.  That seemed an intentional choice by the director.

But the most blatant example is the close up shot of Toni Collette as she discovers the horrible truth of her situation.   It's a very tight close up of her face, stretched in terror.  It looks like it is pulled directly from the scene in The Shining where Shelley Duvall is reacting to the blood pouring from the elevator.

e0qsici,"Absolutely.  I believe the entire film is a view from a person with schizophrenia/dissociative identity disorder, and thus ours is the neutral view.  The family members, Paimon and the dog are fractured personalities of the schizophrenic host.  The fact that time jumps around based on the clocks, dates and calendars is compatible with schizophrenia.  The ""chaos"" of the film as it progresses is also compatible with these mental disorders.

We have a birds-eye view, from the mind of a schizophrenic with dissociative identity disorder.",8pg2ma
e0r89g8,"So my reply will pale in comparison but your remarks on the neutrality of the film struck a cord with me. 

The phrase ""this is what it is, nothing more nothing less"" comes to mind - the juxtaposition of her unwilling participation in the machine aka ""it's what I do"" and the film/her models brutal representation of the facts (the jarring cut to the severed head, the almost blase look on her face as she saws her own head off).

There's something to be said for the audience's participation in the movie (we're along for the ride) and her role. Whether there's intention to have the audience sympathize with Annie, I'm not sure, but I feel like I empathize more with her character after the movie. Aside from the fact that we chose to see the movie, once we're in the seat, ""it's what moviegoers do"".

I agree with most 4th wall breakages - tacky for the most part. But this one felt subtle, and coupled with the uneasiness / tension experience by both the audience and by the characters (in very visible ways...we see Annie frequently look like she's almost crawling out her skin), I would think it's very intentional.

The answer to that one seems pretty clearly yes.

That said the director did an awesome job, I felt, of also establishing a history of mental illness in the family and making it ambiguous as to if events in the movie were actually happening because of the cult or if they were in Annie's/Peter's head. That's the reason for the title of the film I believe: the constant wondering if what happened is because of a messed up family or genetic mental illness. How did the body get in the attic? Did the cult put it there or did Annie do it herself unknowingly? How about why the dad gets set on fire? Was that a supernatural occurrence or, again, did Annie do it herself? There are so many questions that come down to one of two answers: the Grandma's cult did it or the family did it. In either case family plays an enormous deal, thus Hereditary.",8pg2ma

e14atoe,"From what I’ve gathered the family history of mental illness is due to the grandmother. Paimon needed a male host since he is a male spirt. The grandfather suffered from depression and starved himself and Annie’s brother killed himself blaming his mother because she was “trying to put voices in his head.” So what I think happened his the grandmother tried to cast paimon into her husband, then her son, then her granddaughter. Her husband and son killed themselves because of it. 

Another thing is that Annie said that her husband implemented a no contact rule that was in place when Peter was born, but not Charlie. So the grandmother was able to finally able to “curse” someone in her family, but since Charlie was a girl and not a boy it was a mismatch, hence why Charlie was the grandmother’s favorite and why she wanted Charlie to be a boy. ",8pg2ma
e14zadr,"I came to the realization about halfway through the movie that what we're witnessing is [mostly through the eyes of a schizophrenic Annie and Peter. They hint on this early on when Annie goes to group therapy, and things like when she lights the book on fire and sees herself catch on fire, a lot of Annie's experiences are very obviously not based in reality. They verified this near the end when she ""finds"" the body of her mother and the photo album and tries to show and explain to Steve what's going on and you just see the hopelessness on his face. That's why he said she was sick and he needed to call the police. If you pay attention he was acting this way since Charlie dies, while Annie and Peter are the only ones really experiencing anything that could be considered unusual.](#spoiler)",8pg2ma

I don't think so. The director has said in a few interviews that Paimon's possession of different host bodies is unavoidable and inevitable (hence ""hereditary""); the family has little to no free will of their own. Paimon eventually gets what he wants.

The dioramas are a central part of the movie: they are meticulously created and manipulated, and in the opening shot the camera zooms in to one of the model homes and it goes into Peter's room. I think that shows us from the beginning that they are all being controlled by greater forces.",8pg2ma

that scene is meant to play as Annie’s big redemptive moment, she’s going to sacrifice herself for her son. It’s a beautiful gesture but part of the cruel logic of the film is it’s an empty gesture.

Paimon's spirit was supposed to inhabit Annie's dead brother, but he committed suicide. 

Paimon then inhabited Charlie, but Paimon hates being inside a female body because he's a man. This caused him to forget / become confused about his own true nature until Charlie was killed. 

Paimon then temporarily possessed Annie, compelling her to terrify Peter and saw her own head off. 

After this, as well as the ritual (where the cult woman tries to expel Peter at school), Paimon finally inhabits Peter's body. ",8pg2ma
e4kv7jt,"What? It was all connected. You should watch it again, because understanding what is going on adds a lot to the experience. 


* The woman yelling at the son was Jane, a cultist, the same woman who befriended the mom.

* The daughter seeing her mom serves as foreshadowing, letting the viewer know that her presence is still here. This scene makes even more sense when you know that the grandmother is literally still there. 

* The drawings were foreshadowing too. Decapitation is a constant throughout the movie. I'm not up to date in my Paimon canon, but the crowned pigeon head has tied to the eventual idol, where Charlie's decapitated head similarly bore a crown.  This also pulls into question just how much of Charlie was actually her, and not just Paimon. Especially considering how different Charlie seemed when she spoke through her mother.

* The writing on the wall and the drawings are connected to the cult. The symbol *is* the symbol for Paimon. I can't imagine how awesome this movie is for those that study theology. But for us plebs, the symbol serves as a constant to let us know there is something else at work here, and it's a way to connect the members of the cult together. It's not so different from Christians walking around with crosses on their necks. The words serve the same purpose. Just like the incantation the mother read, it's not in a language we understand. 

There are a lot of great comments here explaining how everything is connected, and how just about every line has some significance. ",8pg2ma

He possessed Annie to use as a puppet to scare the hell out of Peter so he could possess him. Once he entered Peter the cult closed the ritual and locked his possession into Peter.

I think the question the teacher asked was something along the lines of ""Does it make it more tragic or less tragic that [the main character] has no control over the events that happen to him?""   


It made me think about the cult, and how it seemed they had everything ""planned"" (the symbol carved into the pole, Joan worming her way into Annie's life). It seemed to me that the idea of pre-determination and lack of true control came into play there, because the cult was doing so much behind the scenes to influence the lives of the Graham family, so it seemed like they had little to no control over the events that unfolded.    



One girl in the class even said something along the lines of ""they're just pawns in this horrible, hopeless machine."" I feel like that was a good analogy for the family - just pawns in the schemes of the cult.",8pg2ma

2. She wanted to have a miscarriage or burn them with paint thinner over giving her children to the devil.  Now her son resents her.

another great cause of intense flashbacks was the dinner scene when annie is screaming at peter. i have had almost the exact conversation/tone/scowl from my mother over the dinner table (minus the killing my sister part, but all of the blame/accountability part) multiple times. 

the movie as a whole was very personally triggering for me, and i think that it is absolutely valid and acceptable for you to feel so uneasy after seeing it, especially if youve had similar experiences (without Paimon, obviously). i'm glad you sought therapy and i hope this is at least somewhat of a comfort in knowing you aren't alone!

When they put him in Charlie's body it was newborn, so no one noticed.

So for me, the logical question to ask is ""what are Annie's character flaws?""

I think that the thing inherited from the grandmother to Annie, the reason for the title, is the unwillingness to fully engage with being a mother.

Annie's eulogy in the first act establishes that the grandmother is very distant from her daughter. Over the course of the story, it is revealed that she was caught up in supernatural intrigues and that she was using her daughter as an object in that agenda.

The consequence of this is that Annie expects to be betrayed by those she allows in and thus can't express her feelings honestly to her family (she won't tell her husband how she feels and resorts to group therapy); she never learned how to resolve conflicts with family and so she behaves childishly towards her children (sending Charlie with Peter to a high school party as a way of spiting him for a long-held grudge); and because it seems to her that she can never fix her problems, she retreats from them, first into her work (the miniatures) and then into the occult (the seance fixation can also be thought of as a kind of unwillingness to face her living family's immediate needs and attempt to fulfill them). Looking at it that way, Annie's inability to be a mother is ultimately the Aristotelian flaw that permits the cult to manipulate her.",8pg2ma

Fucking insane.",8pg2ma
e0g6yqz,"I can't stop thinking about it. People are talking more about Annie's decapitation scene but that was nothing compared to the car accident. I've tried to write up how I felt about it but I can never quite articulate the revulsion and despair I felt. I'm not squeamish when it comes to movies but I reflexively shut my eyes at the point of impact. I had to force myself to keep watching when they showed the head. 

That poor little girl. She didn't even want to go the party. She found a little happiness in a slice of cake and it ends up killing her. The whole sequence shook me to the core. It was very difficult pulling myself back into the film. ",8pg2ma

Alex Wolff did an amazing job at portraying the absolutely overwhelming feeling of despair and immense shock/lack of understanding that I imagine someone might feel in that truly terrible situation.  Like it would be too much for a human to process.  That scene definitely stuck with me and it's one of the reasons I can't see that movie for a second time.  I think the reason some people might not be mentioning it constantly in this thread is because of how graphic some of the later decapitation scenes were as well.  I felt like the piano wire scene was equally if not more graphic, but it didn't have the emotional gravity that Charlie's scene did.    ",8pg2ma

e0g7h7u,"The decapitation scene for me was something that was slightly foreshadowed, after all Charlie did cut the head of the bird that hit the window. A lot of the supernatural occurrences and tragedies throughout the first half of the film were almost all construed as moments of ""bad luck"". The fact that the party was in the middle of nowhere, Charlie having the breathing issue, then Peter having to speed in the dark trying his best to get his sister to the hospital, all for it to end short. 

I think that the decapitation scene has probably some of the best horror elements in it, simply because the movie told the story with the awareness that something supernatural was behind it, without it even be obvious to the characters that this is what was happening. ",8pg2ma

Straight scary demons and stuff is great I suppose, but I thought this movie was going to have ""more"" to it...ESPECIALLY after the dinner scene where Annie exclaims, ""No one takes responsibility for their actions"" and Peter retorts that Charlie didn't want to go to the party, so what about herself. I was expecting this line to be the theme of the movie, and instead I got ""actual"" demons. 

Didn't do it for me. ",8pg2ma
e11wkcg,Idk I thought it was more tragic that this nice well meaning family were just being toyed with and were pawns as part of a bigger plan. Like the scene where the teacher was breaking down themes of the play they were studying and discussing how it didn’t matter what moves the characters made their demise was inevitable.,8pg2ma
e15e2sj,"I believe the Ellen was a classic narcissist with delusions of grandeur. She came to believe in Paimon and was charasmtic enough to start a dedicated cult. I believe the Paimon doesn't really exist, but the the cult that are worshipping are operating under the assumption that he is.

I also believe that all the super nature events could have been just hallucinations. All the flying through the air and random fires were just misrepresentations of what really occurred, which is that Annie first attempted to burn herself, but stopped. Then she immolated her husband, but dissociated and believed a supernatural event burned him to cope with the trauma. In the final scene I believe Peter finally burst into full flung psychosis and murdered his mother himself and posed his mother's body in the tree house himself. Like his mother he invented a story that the body was possessed by a ghost to cope with the trauma of killing his mother, even though it could've been in self defense.

Peter actually goes through all of the classic symptoms of psychosis. He starts hallucinating sounds and images, he has symptoms of conversion which is when emotional pain becomes a physical symptom. In some cases people with perfectly functioning legs become unable to walk. In Peter's case he starts choking at random times, as if reliving trauma over his sister's death. He assumes a [catatonic state](https://goo.gl/images/C4aFch) during class and engages in severe self harm. I'm not saying Paimon was for sure just a hallucination, but if you could imagine someone telling you this story around a campfire instead presented as a movie iy becomes a lot more ambiguous as to what was real and what wasn't.

When I state people respond by citing scenes outside of the protagonist's perspective. But those scenes don't contain anything super natural. For instance the scene of inside Joan's apartment was just a shrine to Paimon. That doesn't really mean Paimom exists. It just means Joan believes he does and she's been conspiring against Annie the whole time. I have no ill will toward people with different interpretations of film, but this theory of mine makes a lot of people angry for some reason. I'm not at all claiming this is the only correct interpretation of the film, only that I like that interpretation myself.

We see that when the mom goes through the grandma’s boxes the second time and takes out a door mat that says “Annie” and “Charles” because she prepared for a grandson.

e0e6ud8,"1. Somewhat, there are some great theories in this thread I'll paraphrase: Paimon can't directly control everything, but coordinating with his followers with the symbol on the pole, he can influence what happens.  He might have nudged on the contaminated knife and Charlie's urge to lean out the window right then, as well as the deer in the road.

2. Feeds almost into 1, again paraphrasing a theory: Ellen had Paimon inside of her (the DID reference) which she tried to pass off on her son (the schizophrenic suicide reference), then onto her daughter's son after that failed.  When Annie refused to let her near Peter, she had to settle for Charlie (who she wanted to be a boy) and presumably passed the spirit of Paimon through breastfeeding (Annie references this to Charlie then we see the miniature).  I took the miniature with decapitated Peter, as well as the pictures with his eyes out, to mean that he was the ultimate target and would lose his mind/identity once Paimon finally got into him.

So it seems to me as if Paimon was waiting in/around Charlie, subtly influencing events in her life (with help from the cult) to lead her towards death at the hands of her brother.  This made him vulnerable to possess as the coveted male body.",8pg2ma

It's hard to know if Anne turned after her mother died or what. I assume her mother was grooming her from a young age as well after her brother committed suicide. All her sleepwalking happened before her mother's death as well. It's hard to tell what parts are the ""good"" Anne and what parts are being manipulated by spiritual forces. I have to assume maybe her almost burning her children and wanting to abort Peter were all her ""good"" side wanting to end the cycle of sacrifices, but her mother's conditioning probably kicked in to prevent that.",8pg2ma

Paimon was released from his mortal form of Charlie when she died. He caused all the chaos while he was a spirit, he knew everything and had his range of powers. He caused Peter to see a vision of himself smiling and he even tried to possess Peter at school but Peter wasn't at his most vulnerable point yet and was able to resist him. 

But when Paimon is ritually locked into a mortal body, like Charlie and Peter, he apparently forgets who he is until the cult gradually ""wakes"" him up.  So at the end he only remembers being Charlie because the cult closed the ritual, locking him into Peter's body. 

I personally believe Paimon's spirit possessed Annie at the seance and imitated Charlie to further break down Peter's defenses.

Just like any other supernatural even of the movie. A failed suicidal jump, right after watching his mother kill herself, would probably drive the sons psychosis into overdrive.

I think it mirrors mental health issues - and right up until the third act you're supposed to think that it might *be* a psychotic break, and when Steven finally snaps and accuses her of being behind it all (and she does sound like a lunatic by that point) you're supposed to suspect that he may be right, meaning the ""betrayal"" not only comes from Steven but also from the audience.  And then she throws the book into the fire, shit gets crae and you think ""oh, fuck, my mistake"".

Rather than a film about a real issue filmed through a fantastic lens, I think it's a film about a fantastic subject that casts a skewed mirror onto real issues; how trauma is passed from damaged subject to damaged subject, how people depend on us, how sometimes that burden is too great and the dreadful result of what happens when we break under the load.  And also on how ""blame"" falls in those circumstances, in our own eyes and in the eyes of others.  

Maybe we all have our minor faults that sometimes act together in catastrophic harmony and in those circumstances is it all of our faults?  Or nobody's?  Or both and ultimately the responsibility is arbitrary?  Apart from Steve.  Steve has no faults.  Steve is the slightly distant father we all deserve.

In my opinion nothing is scarier than something that could actually happen in real life, which is why the first half went under my skin so much.

The film is called Hereditary and it kinda has a double meaning. I personally think the “hereditary” aspect comes from the family being predisposed to having to house a demon from hell in their bodies and pass it on. Of course to anyone else in the world the host would have symptoms that could only be explained by mental health disorders which is where that meaning comes in. 

The whole film is a metaphor of mental illness and family dynamic... but in this case the family is also literally experiencing everything that happens. ",8pg2ma

e11dvyx,"I'd be agreeing with you if it weren't for that final scene! I tend to prefer supernatural stuff remaining slightly ambiguous too (hallucinations or whatnot), but the scale tipped for me when Annie starts levitating so I was expecting it to fudge the ending.

But... the occult/ritual element salvaged it for me - the ending was so delightfully unhinged that I wound up glad that's the direction it went in. Most of that is probably thanks to the score, I love that it switches from dread/horror to wonder/celebration so you're witnessing those moments through the eyes of a worshipper.",8pg2ma

Peter burdened with the guilt of his sisters death was easily led to suicide when seeing his father burnt.

First she recreates the the scene of her “seeing” the spirit of her mother in the room. Then as Annie becomes more and more upset she begins recreating the scenes of Charlie’s death. Her husband even inquires as to why it’s necessary and points out that it will upset Peter.

To me it appeared that by constantly focusing on these moments she was attracting certain intentions. 

",8pg2ma
e0ex6fl,"It probably represented the lack of control they have over their lives. Their whole entire life was puppetteered by the cult. The houses depict a time in their lives all the way back when the grandmother was still alive and would treat Charlie as her favorite child when she was just a baby (breastfeeding her etc).

She's even wearing the necklace at the funeral isn't she?  Maybe she was trying to prevent it? As if something good in her was trying to stop the evil from happening.

- Charlie, Annie, & Ellen are the ones who are decapitated so it’s as if they’re giving their knowledge (of the arts) to Paimon.

3. a) Annie says how when she gave birth to peter she kept him away from her mother, this didn’t give paimon the opportunity to host in his body. However Charlie was exposed to Ellen from the beginning and Annie even let her mother breastfeed Charlie. I presume something in that time happened and paimon took control of Charlie’s body.

 When the mom, Annie, finds the grandma Ellen's photo album, she sees a picture of Ellen feeding Charlie a bottle with liquid full of black specks.

She didn't want to go through with her pregnancy (as revealed in the dream) and kept Peter as far away from the grandmother as possible after he was born. I think it's because deep in her subconscious she always knew (also in the dream: Peter asking her why she's afraid of him).

e1o5fzg,Hell yes.  She was amazing.  Made the movie.,8pg2ma
e0tt6zw,"1. Yep, I agree. Remember the note towards the start of the movie that Annie finds in her mother's book? The rewards will pale in comparison to the sacrifice or whatever. So when she sleepwalks and tries to kill her kids, that's her trying to escape from the nightmarish machinery of her life. (When she tries to pull Peter's head off etc, is she acting at the will of the cult? Not sure)
2. Sounds right, goes with the ""hereditary"" theme 
4. She couldn't be at the funeral because if it was known that she's was associated with Annie's mom, there's no way she could get close to Annie and have her performe the ritual. 
5.-7. That's interesting because I sort of assumed that Paimon wasn't officially inhabiting anyone until the end of the movie. That's not super clear (does Paimon make clicky noises?)  - does he just randomly inhabit someone till he finds a proper host body? ahhh don't know. Nonetheless I love this movie and like reading other's thoughts. 
",8pg2ma
e0v0oad,">Although I'm not sure whether Joan ever really had kids or not, my guess would be that she wished Paimon would take over her son or grandson's bodies if they ever did exist. Although, maybe she doesn't have the right heritage that Paimon likes?

I feel like Joan probably made up the story about her kids in order to trick Annie into using the seance at her own home. This is why incantations are placed all around the house on the walls (pandemonium, etc). Could also be that they weren't good enough candidates, or caught onto what was going on and drowned themselves similar to Annie's Brother hanging himself because of their mother trying to ""put people inside him"".

>What's so special about Graham family that makes them the chosen ones?

Mental illness runs in their family and Paimon requires the vessel to be vulnerable before he can take over. Annie & her grandmother both had multiple personality disorder, her grandfather starved himself, her brother was schizophrenic; etc. That would make them prime targets. Plus the fact that the grandmother was the Queen of the cult probably gave them the honour of summoning Paimon. They could also be the only family in the cult that has 3 living generations needed for the sacrifice and the last generation also having a son as the vessel.

As for the Charlie & Paimon related questions, I think we're meant to assume that even though her personality was greatly affected by Paimon, she still has some form of control over herself and that Paimon hasn't fully possessed her for some reason that we're not told. We know he can possess women, like Annie, even though he prefers males. So it could be that he's never taken full control because she's never been emotionally vulnerable enough, as we're told she's never cried even when she was a baby. But the film maker did confirm that Paimon has been inside her since birth. ",8pg2ma

e17ildl,"My thoughts are, they could have made this be a psychological thriller, where the whole thing was in Annie’s head (right around the moment of the book scene you mentioned I was convinced she’d gone crazy and that burning the book would be a distraction for her to hurt him; something about the tone of the shot, she sounded more crazy and less convincing) or they could have made it another possession/haunting movie where they find out it was the ghost of the mother wrecking their lives, or maybe they were ghosts, but it felt like the one they gave us was a more horror movie kind of ending, like no it’s not anything logical, it was a cult of satanists or whatever. Kinda like the ultimate ending of the Witch and house of the devil of which this film reminded me. I think it’s a callback to older horror before the slasher film flooded the genre (but I don’t have any titles for example at the moment).

I think in a way, it made things okay for the viewer, because throughout the film I felt so invested in the family and was feeling really bad for them, but then the movie reminded me that it was a movie and I left the theater less disturbed than if it had provided a more realistic resolution.",8pg2ma

e0bdfvh,"I honestly wouldn't have even minded the occultism if they hadn't felt the need to literally explain it all again right at the end.

It left kind of a bad taste in my mouth right at the end, but I still really enjoyed it on the whole.",8pg2ma
e0ezfu7,"I agree. The best horror, for me, is something more realistic. Something that could really occur, or a character reacting a way that a normal, pragmatic person *would* react... I love it. Ghosts/cults/possession? Blah.

That being said, I really liked this film. It did what it did well, and unexpectedly. Very cool. ",8pg2ma
e0ezfck,"I'm completely convinced that the movie was not true possession.

The entire movie is a narrative of mental illness. The whole family has a history of it (minus the dad), Charlie was always seriously ill and her death was a traumatic catalyst for the rest of her family. Peter started experiencing it and Annie had a full schizophrenic meltdown.

We see the cult as real because we're experiencing the story from within a mentally ill mind, but there are clues that the supernatural stuff wasn't real throughout the whole movie.

Of course, the writing intentionally tries to leave it ambiguous, but I think it's pretty clear that the entire thing is an allegory for mental illness.",8pg2ma
e0h1429,"I think you have to look to the mythology of Paimon, he is an all-knowing, all-seeing god. He has the ability to see the future, boundless wisdom etc. So going off of that he would have the influence and ability to orchestrate/predict the necessary outcomes for his own “rebirth”.
ALSO there’s some debate within the thread in regard to Charlie’s nut allergy, some people say she eats peanut m&m’s earlier and has no reaction. That the allergic reaction is brought on at will by Paimon’s demonic influence...I’m not sure but it’s interesting to entertain.

It's a tough one to gauge.  It isn't all jump scares, but there are jump scares.  It isn't a psychological thriller, but it's got plenty of psychological thriller pieces.  It isn't a ghost movie, but it's got plenty of ghostly elements.  It isn't a slasher, but there's ample slashing.

And on the mental illness thing. I think the creators took and emphasized a lot of real psychological problems from families that have to bear the loss of a loved one and amplified them by a 100x.

e0f01qf,"Likely it was treated as an accident and forgiven since Peter was underage and went into shock. There were likely a lot of witnesses at the party who could attest that she was having an allergic reaction and he rushed her out of there.

Peter definitely should have gotten a psychiatric evaluation after he beat his head against the desk, but his father was a psychologist and probably arrogantly believed that he could handle it himself.

e0ez2ae,"I think Peter got *some* grooming. The main scene I could remember was Joanie shouting at Peter and expelling him from his body when he was at the school. His picture was also in her place on an alter, so maybe there were rituals she could perform after he was in the seance?",8pg2ma
e0f2ei2,"1) I think it's just the obedient nature of the curse that she had inherited taking the body to the ritual. 

2)I think it was just her way of beginning the ritual; like a welcoming

3) Because she's Ellen's next to kin, and then Charlie's body was there as well, all 3 of the bloodline. She may not been in on it, but things had been set in motion for her due to Ellen; this was the conclusion of their part of the ritual whether Annie liked it or not.

4) Others have stated that Peter was not yet weak enough mentally...but that doesn't make sense because....look what just happened. I like to think that Annie's beheading had to happen first as a ""motherly sacrifice"" to allow the demon entrance into the son because others have stated the picture in the book Annie finds shows the demon with 3 severed heads, and at that point, only 2 had been severed.

The bigger question that ties in to this is the breastfeeding diorama, either Ellen made some weird attempt to breastfeed her and Annie thwarted it then brushed it off as an unstable episode -OR- it actually happened and in the act of Ellen breastfeeding Charlie, some weird transference may have occurred.

When Annie talks to her about how she never cried as a baby etc. Seems like that was setting up Charlie as always having something within her, but if you go back and listen to Charlie’s voice coming through Annie during the seance...it sounded like a very different Charlie. She was super emotive and desperate, whereas her demeanor when she told her brother her throat was getting bigger was subdued.

She surmised that Annie, suffering from DID (like her mother) and possible schizophrenia triggered by the extreme events, killed Steve. Peter, then, kills Annie and imagines that this was all part of some ritual to make himself a king. Peter, then would also be suffering from extreme mental illness. I thought it was an interesting read on the story. I also don't necessarily agree. I think the film sets up the mental illness history of the family in the story very well, and it is definitely connected to the overall themes, but I don't think we're shown enough to imply that what is happening on screen isn't *really* happening in the reality of the film.

e0o9v83,">Did she bring her dead mother into the attic?

No. The cult/Paimon did. 

>Was she trying to save Peter by banging her heard on the attic?

No. She was essentially gone at this point. The moment that she is possessed after her husband burns, she's gone. The demon/cult possesses you at your most vulnerable, which is why they take the time to scare the people they intend to possess before doing so. 

>Would she have burnt had her husband thrown the sketchbook into the fire as requested?

I'm not totally clear on this part. I think it basically burns whoever Paimon feels like burning. It still needed Anne to complete the task at hand, so when the husband was threatening to call the police I think he sealed his own fate. 

>Was this really all about grandma's wish for Charlie to become Paimon? Did Peter die in the fall from the attic?

It appears that she was blessed with ""riches"" in exchange for the soul of a male family member. She tried with her husband, and her son unsuccessfully. Anne kept Peter away from her as a child, so they had to use Charlie as a carrier until the plan could be carried out later.The ultimate goal was to give the God of Hell a young male body to walk the earth. I don't know if Peter died, from the fall, but he was incapacitated to the point where possession was possible. 

>Looked like grannie and mom lost their heads, what about the smiling naked people, would the other treehouse worshipers lose their heads too, or was it only necessary for Peter's family -- and the smiling guy at grannie's funeral smiling at Charlie, was that Paimon?

If you look at the illustration of the demon, he is carrying 3 heads. 3 people were decapitated in the film: grandma, Charlie, Anne. I assume it is part of the ritual. It also has been theorized that the demon leaves a body after being decapitated. I don't think the smiling guy was Paimon, he just knew Charlie was selected as a vessel and was smiling at her. 

 
",8pg2ma
e0re8nk,"1.) The husband combusted because his role was through and I think Paimon needs the host to be lost into madness (Being the demon king of mischief) before he can possess them hence why the beam of light takes over Annie. The  husband played a role as a foil for us the audience but he was a hindrance to Paimon and was dealt with as such

2.) I agree with Mastery, it was all to wear him down. Akin to the Skeleton Key, it cannot affect you if you don't believe in it but by this time he was losing sleep and could not focus. He was in a sense slowly being spirited away

3.) The episode at school was just Paimon toying with Peter

4.) I read somewhere that the heads had to be cut off for Paimon to leave the body of that which he possessed. He possessed the  grandmother first in her ritual, then Charlie and coexisted with her, then the mother to subdue and push Peter over the edge. Once he killed himself his shadow(presence) leaves and Paimon possesses his new vessel that can no longer reject him. ",8pg2ma
e0r89r4,"I saw both Joan shouting “I expel you” at Peter and Peters episode at school to be like the beginning of the possession, like Paimon hasn’t taking control completely yet, these are just the early stages of him taking over Peters body.

As for the dad, I’ve really got no answers. I loved the movie, but yeah some of the witchcraft stuff at the end didn’t make a whole lot of sense or was unclear. ",8pg2ma
e0rcs7s,"1. I think Steve combusted because Annie thought she had the book & fire cause & effect all figured out--but she didn't. After all, mom was the witch...she was just gaining awareness. 

2. I thought Joan was expelling ""Peter"" from Peter so that Paimon could take over. Also to psyche him out and wear down his resistance (culminating in that Exorcist-like scene of his arm and face in rictus before he's slammed into the desk)

3. Paimon wasn't in possession of him but was still hanging around --evidenced by whenever we saw that blue/green lens effect.

4. I feel Annie went full-tilt-boogie just before Peter took refuge in the attic. She was like a puppet whose strings were being pulled by the mischievous Paimon and those naked witches... Annie had ""left the building"".",8pg2ma
e0ul0ou,"It ties back to a few points earlier in the film:

First, Annie says that she was so estranged from her mother at the time of Peter's birth, that her mother didn't interact with Peter at all.  However, that changed with Charlie, and Charlie and her Grandmother were described as close.

Second, one of the books she reads says that Paimon prefers to posses male bodies.  Possibly had to do with the deaths of Annie's father and brother.  Seems like Paimon attempting/possessing you isn't an experience that ends well for you.  Could be the possession manifests as mental illness, that there's elements of Paimon and the host body's personality there.

I believe the implication is that Charlie was/was possessed by Paimon as a contingency, as she was the only child that Grandma had access to, and her death/the events of the film were basically the cult's attempt to get Paimon to possess the ideal body, Peter's.

So Paimon being referred to as Charlie as referenced by the second point, as Charlie would be the name that this incarnation of Paimon recognized.",8pg2ma

And why was Charlie killed? Charlie was not male, so she had to be murdered. The Demon king had to live inside a male host. 

Remember, Annie's mom only had access to the kids when Charlie was born, so she never got Peter to be possessed by the demon king. Things had to be corrected (a.k.a. all of them should have died in order for the demon king to live inside Peter).",8pg2ma

These events started happening to Peter, the lights and sounds and then Joanie from across the street. He then is clearly possessed in the next scene.

e0bcr1d,"I just watched this and went over a lot of this with my husband so I'll give you my best answers/interpretation.

-I'm not really certain on this one. 
Maybe Ellen had to die as part of the ritual for things to get going since it was her bloodline invoking Paimon. At the end there was a framed picture of Ellen titled ""Queen Leigh"" so my guess is that Paimon is her King/she's the cult queen and her death was the 1st official start to the summoning, though I don't think that was ever addressed or inferred. 

-I think Steve burst into flames because he had to die, everyone did, even the poor dog, and Paimon conned Annie into thinking she'd die instead.
So because when initially Annie tried to burn the book she catches fire, understandably, she assumes she will again. She's willing to sacrifice herself and burn but is too scared to throw it in the fire again. So when she convinces Steve to do it she truly believes she'll die thanks to Paimon having already showed her she's connected to the book and what happens to it happens to her. But it was all just a ruse strung together by the demon so that Steve would die, leaving Annie and Peter all alone with no means of help. He was the last person who still had a grasp on reality and he would have absolutely protected his son at all costs, getting in the way of the possesion. 


-Ellen' s head was removed as part of the ritual. Three heads in total were removed in one way or another. Charlie gets decapitated, Ellen's head was removed, Annie cuts her own head off. In the book Annie finds in her mother's possessions that details the demon' s summoning, there is a drawing of Paimon holding 3 heads. So apparently that's his thing.


-Paimon entered Charlie through Ellen. I'm assuming when she breast fed her as a baby (eww) and probably also just by close contact. If he wasn't already ""in"" Charlie, Ellen was certainly doing things to open her up to him. She treated Charlie as her favorite because she never got a chance to be around Peter as a baby (Steve had instituted a no contact rule as Annie and Ellen had such a toxic relationship). Because of this she never got her hooks into Peter, but when Annie allowed her back into her life after having Charlie, Ellen knew that she could bring Paimon into Charlie's body and eventually orchestrate that physical bodie's death Thus passing Paimon into Peter's body(the demon' s preferred male form)once he had been mentally broken down enough. In the book on spiritualism it said Paimon would inhabit the body of the most vulnerable.
Charlie as a baby was vulnerable enough to be inhabited, but Paimon wanted a male body, so Peter was broken down in every way to become vulnerable enough to slip into. 


I think that's it! I could be way off, but that was my interpretation.",8pg2ma
e0bbwyg,"Ok so I just watched it and trying to process it so I'll try answering questions

- I don't think it had anything to do with it. I think that it helped with making Annie into a more suitable host until it can go into Peter because it continued breaking her down.

- My thought is that it was once again trying to break her down. She was trying to burn the book and put it off on someone else and free themselves of Charlie and the spirits so it used him as a catalyst for her full breakdown.

- I think it was for the ritual. I remember somewhere in the book where it required the women's heads in the family to be cut off

- Because Paimon required a human male host. I'm assuming that it happened after Annie's brother died with the ""mom tried to put people inside him"". So the timeline goes Ellen wants the brother as the host and it doesn't work -> Annie had Peter already but Ellen wasn't in her life -> Annie is pregnant but much to Ellen's disdain it ends up being a girl -> Ellen knows Paimon is in Charlie so she makes her a recluse and breastfeeds her. Basically he was stuck in Charlie because that's who was born hence why the Mom said to Charlie that she wanted her to be a boy. When they realized that Charlie isn't a healthy host they decided to let Charlie die and then use Annie as a path to get into Peter.",8pg2ma
e0bbpd1,"I think I have a partial answer to one of the questions. Annie tells everyone at the support group that her brother hung himself because his mom was trying to put people in his body. She had to wait for her daughter to have kids to pass Paimon on. The grandma wasn’t allowed to see Peter when he was younger, as Annie said. He must have been too old to possess by the time Ellen met him and that’s why she chose Charlie.",8pg2ma
e0bcxos,"Agree about the zig zagging. There is a complete tonal shift in the the last act and it doesn't really work well. Compare it to Rosemary's baby, the tension is constant and builds up to something concrete, here it's just stop and go and all over the place.  ",8pg2ma
e0bbptb,"My take:

1. Ellen knew charlie had the demon, but had to die to speak to her via her spirit to get this whole ball rolling. I think this is left out because over explanation tends to make plots worse. It is assumed, like with the Wvtch, there are unknowns that we just aren't allowed to have revealed to us. I think this is acceptable. Think how many ""sciency"" movies are ruined by going a little too deep.
2. Decapitation seems to be the main form of sacrifice for this demon. In the illustration it is sitting on a pile of heads. Assuming it was done post humously and ritualistically.
3. She mistook her burning as the ""rule"" to the book burning but it was a simple deception done by the evil presence.
4.Again, Ellen favored Charlie because she was suseptable(sic) and therefore a target. Ellen bridged the path into Charlie body.

I found it funny until I realized something relevant to my background as a counselor.

It may sound funny to someone unaware of their trauma but to the person listening to their stories, that kind of sobbing is almost chilling in the sense that this youth is still stuck somewhere in their childhood memories and is crying like a child as opposed to a teenager.

More proof of Peter being a little boy in his mind because of a stunted childhood replete with tension and psychological terror, is when he screams and cries, ""Mommy, I'm sorry"" as Annie repeatedly bangs her head on the attic door upside down.

We know from the dialogue that follows and from passages in the screenplay that Annie has multiple personality disorder and they come out while she sleeps, and that she was trying to kill him to save him from Paimon (one of her repressed personalities knew what was going on). So it could be that her anger at her Son where she trashed all her miniatures and ripped the head off his, triggered one of these multiple personalities to come forward while she was sleeping and try to kill him in that way.

e0d4muu,"My take on Annie is that she and her brother grew up in a household where their mother taught them about Paimon. That is why Annie says her brother killed himself because he believed their mom was trying to ""put people inside him.""

Annie admits that her mother was always extremely manipulative with her, and that it was her husband that was finally able to separate Annie from her mother.

My personal hunch is that Annie repressed a lot of what happened to her growing up as a coping mechanism and denial perhaps. Her sleepwalking moments were expressions of her suppressed memories/desires that would occur during vulnerable stages of her life.

I believe she was a deeply conflicted woman with mental illness because of what her mother did to her. Annie admits she never wanted to have a baby but was manipulated into doing so. I think she was trying to have a miscarriage and trying to murder Peter in his sleep because in her deepest state of mind she knows her child would be doomed to Paimon.

Her sleepwalks are her acting on the brainwashed part of her that she has suppressed, or they are her acting on her innermost fears (Peter is not safe from Paimon, I'll kill him to prevent the possession).",8pg2ma
e0d9kfx,"If you remember when Annie is looking thru her mom’s photo albums, you can see Joan in the pictures of the rituals. I’m guessing the cult dig up the body and put it up in the attic ( they never say who did it.) But there were those symbols drawn over the body so it could be the cult members.

I think the mental illness in the family was a red herring to make us think this was all gonna be a psychological horror film instead of being a paranormal horror film. The audience automatically assumes that Annie will be the crazy person and then when you find out that there are crazy people at play, then it’s totally out of left field.",8pg2ma

There's not going to be any answers to your questions, only conjecture. It's not bad conjecture by any means, it's the good sort of questioning since it's making you think about what you saw while also shocking you.

For instance when Annie was describing sleepwalking (was it really sleepwalking or was it the real Annie trying to reassert control over her body) to Joan about how she had poured paint thinner over herself and the sleeping kids, did you get the idea that Peter and Charlie were in the same or separate beds? Because what came to mind for me was that they were in the same bed. When my wife and I were talking about it, she thought the scene played out as them being in separate beds.

So while there could have been much simpler deaths, I think it had to be by decapitation in order for him to be released.",8pg2ma
e0fs7wv,"IMO, Charlie was Paimon, but didn't know it. Her seemingly autistic traits were really the result of seeing a god in a child's body, and not being fully comfortable inhabiting it (she never cried, even at birth, and seemed to find many activities boring or pointless). That said, I think that the death was orchestrated seemingly somewhat without Paimon's conscious planning (maybe unconscious) - clues being that she didn't want cake at first and didn't want to go to the party. Because Paimon was in a girl's body, it's entirely possible that there was a little girl's consciousness involved the whole time (the spirit from the seance scene) that didn't fully have control (like D.I.D.)

I believe the god part of Paimon and the cult at least partially orchestrated events without ""Charlie"" knowing. She seemed legitimately scared/confused throughout events.",8pg2ma
e0fsqg6,"The god doesn't know that he is a god until he is explicitly told so. The god wasn't jusy inhabiting Charlie's body, he _was_ Charlie.

How the cult did that is a real question, but not one that can be explained by anything in the movie.",8pg2ma
e0fpzvt,"I think the idea was that Paimon was trapped inside Charlie's body as she wasn't the ""perfect host"", so he wasn't really in control like he was once he took over Peter. The cult orchestrated her death so that the demon could be released and work on inhabiting Peter.",8pg2ma

e23fk9p,"1. Because Paimon had to be summoned using the grandmother's bloodline, the presence of her body was required at the final ritual. The cult members dug up her body, cut off her head, and brought her to the attic. 
2. The seance is basically a red herring - the viewer is led to believe that Charlie's spirit is being summoned. In actuality, Joan tells Annie to do the ""seance"" because the incantations she tells Annie to recite are actually intended to release Paimon upon the household. The incantations actually use summoning terms like ""liftoach pandemonium"" (basically translates to ""unleash hell"") and the other things that Joan wrote on the walls of Charlie's bedroom. ""Charlie"" possesses Annie because Charlie was really just Paimon all along - her body was female and thus an imperfect host, but her deformity, strange behavior, ability to see things (the cult members burning bodies in the field), and her creation of little figures that mirror the inverted Christ statue at the end of the film all lead us to believe that Charlie was possessed by the demon since birth (her grandmother's influence). Therefore it really isn't Charlie's spirit being channeled through Annie but Paimon's - Annie acts as a gateway for Paimon to enter the house, at which point the demon possesses the family members in turn and things really go to shit. This is the same reason that Peter is referred to as Charlie during the ceremony at the end of the film. Peter as he existed is dead from his fall out the window, but his body now belongs to Paimon (when the creepy blue light enters him) - so therefore in a sense he's also Charlie, since her spirit and the demon's were one. 
3. If you dig a little into the history of Paimon's mythology (found in a book called The Lesser Keys of Solomon), one of his supernatural abilities allows him to conjure visions of the deceased. So in addition to being a creepy misdirection, Ari Aster also made this scene a neat foreshadowing of the film's true nature. ",8pg2ma

e0dpqik,"There are several instances in the film where you will notice things coming together for the cult of Paimon. For example on of the son's teachers showed up naked at the end of the film. People in the support group (aside from joan) were also there worshiping. I haven't seen it said anywhere else but the Heracles story is foreshadowing the hero's journey and the ability (or inability) to make a choice.

In this story you are meant to see that at every turn the family is guided to the will of the cult and Paimon. Every interaction and every person are a manipulation. This is also why we have things such as the scene construction in a way the looks odd, stilted, different in relation to the models. The models are an analogue for the manipulation. A world which is created and crafted to the whim of the creator. In the case of mom, she makes them as a coping mechanism and also as a means to support her family. If you recall the moment she stops focusing on her models she goes off the rails and loses her grip on sanity/reality and succumbs to the demon. Paimon is also artistic and creative. It speaks to why mom is good at crafts and potentially why Charlie is too. 

Overall there are a lot of little things in the movie that you could miss. Repeated viewings will probably help identify and correlate alot of them. In short, to answer your question, the family has no choice. They are being watched and manipulated by the cult of Paimon/Paimon the entire film.

e0hz5bg,"i had similar thoughts, and the conclusion i drew was that Peter had to be in a vulnerable state and the responsibility he felt from Charlies death + his mom acting irrationally and then later on supernaturally + seeing his dad absolutely toasted brought him to that state. they needed to really fuck that kid up before Paimon could use his body as a vessel.   ",8pg2ma
e0hyfb2,"Annie mentions during the group therapy session that she had totally cut her mother out of her life when she was pregnant with and gave birth to Peter, but let her back in when Charlie was born (and it's mentioned at another time, and alluded to with a miniature, that the grandmother even ""fed"" Charlie). My guess is that a newborn is a better/more vulnerable vessel into which to pass the spirit of Paimon, so it wasn't possible at the time to inhabit Peter. 

So I don't think the death cult ""engineered"" Charlie's death. I think that truly was an accident. When she died, the spirit of Paimon needed a new vessel, and it was the perfect opportunity to finally get him into a male vessel. Thus the appearance of Joan. 

As for the Dad being set on fire, my husband's theory is that he was involved somehow (either from the get, or was currently being possessed in that scene). Why else hem and haw about throwing the book in the fire, unless he *knew* it would harm him?",8pg2ma
e0hyfsp,"Well Peter is the only one that has to stay alive so he can be possessed, but to inflict significant psychological damage on him in which to do so.  Also note that Paimon is the prince of chaos and disorder but is also omniscient... this mofo always has a master plan and will have fun with it

Peter - the prize - is obviously a tough nut to crack... he even partly blames his mother for Charlie’s death so not even that event completely destabilized him ( the possession in the class room was brief).  The goal here therefore is to continue to fuck Peter up...without him killing himself (like his uncle / grandfather did).  Seeing his crispy dad contributes...nightmare visions also...but it’s only his mum’s final antics that settle it.

e0fgew3,"I know how you feel, I saw this movie 3 days ago and keep coming back to this discussion to see what people are saying! 

1. Personally, I think that either Annie dug up the body in one of her sleepwalking episodes, or the cult members did it. It seems more likely that the cult members did since it would be a difficult task for a slim middle-aged woman. I think that the body in the attic helped along the demonic presence in some way? There were pictures in the album of the grandma getting riches and wearing a crown (I think?), she somehow already collected her prize and was queen... possibly intermittently while Paimon was trying to find a host.

2. I'm confused on all of that as well. Was Paimon in the grandmother's breastmilk? How did he get passed to her and did Charlie known the presence was inside her? It doesn't seem like she really knew, although she did really like cutting the heads off of things, so maybe she was just half kid, half devil king.

3. It's understandable that Annie would brush her mom's behaviors off as mental illness! I know a schizophrenic person and he's always saying the craziest things about how he saw a spaceship in his backyard or met a reptilian. If Annie really didn't believe in her mother's witchcraft/rituals, then she could have chalked it up to schizophrenia.

4. I took the diorama to be literal. The grandmother wanted to be so close to Charlie that she literally tried to breastfeed her. Somewhere in this post someone said that it probably caused Charlie mental and physical issues, which would make it easier for Paimon to possess her body!

5. The grandmother probably did believe that everything would be worth it if her end goal was to get Paimon a nice new host body. Either that or it was suppose to be just a sweet note from her and Annie's schizophrenia made it out to be an omen of what was to come.

6. I didn't even consider they could have been cult members... that may have just been chance/fate? I can't fathom how the cult members could have set it up so that Charlie would get decapitated from Peter swerving in the road either.

7. It's hard to sneer that without ever really meeting the grandmother. If Paimon was inside of her then she would be focused on finding him a new host body when she died, so maybe it was a means to an end.

8. #tru They couldn't even hook me up with some eye candy?

9. That's confusing as well. I almost want to say that Annie knew it would happen because she was telling him how much she loved him just before he burned to death, which seemed so strange of her character. Maybe she was sleepwalking at that time, or maybe we see what she saw happen in her head instead of seeing what actually happened (her burning him to death herself).

10. Charlie never seemed not evil?

11. Possibility that Paimon was dormant in his female hosts and awakened in a strange new place wondering how he came to be there. He definitely did seem confused. And how was he also Charlie? I guess I'll just accept that Charlie was Paimon.

12. Probably that Trump supporters also support the devil.

13. I REALLY want to know the meanings of all of those words, but after the movie I couldn't remember what they were. I think that either the grandma wrote them before she died or Annie did it while she was ""sleepwalking"". Also I wanted to point out that Annie left herself a bunch of sticky notes! That's also something people who have memory loss/are schizophrenic do to try to stay organized. She may have written those while lucid. Also very interesting that she finished tons of super creepy dioramas and not her actual project, I think that may have been fueling her psychosis in some way.",8pg2ma

She beheads herself downstairs, beside the husband's charred body, while Peter succeeds in hiding in the attic. At the joint funeral for the parents, Joan sits beside him where he sits in the front row, and takes his hand when he's at his most vulnerable. And I mean vulnerable: visibly sunken eyes, hasn't slept or eaten, etc. 

Cue one of Joan's little speeches, ""I knew your mother from grief counseling, I never thought it would get this far."" Cue a wider shot, panning out to reveal the funeralgoers are the cult members from earlier (maybe they were seen outside and around the house, but not seen by Peter), smiling in their suits and staring at him intently. Joan says something to the effect of, ""Come with us, Charlie, we'll take care of you."" Something like confusion flickers in Peter's eyes at being wrongly addressed, but he's just too haunted at this point to even react. He nods and follows her out of the church, with the cult members filing out and following behind them. One is holding the crown.

The next shot is grief counseling, only all the original participants are shown to have been cult members the whole time. The light is mainly focused on the center of the group, where Peter is telling his story about hiding in the attic as long as possible before he came down. He echoes his mothers line from earlier, ""Should I be sadder?""

And then the culmination is, like\-\- Joan and the cult successfully manipulating him into being a willing host for Paimon, mirroring the way cults often cut people off from their family members in order of dependence.

e0sysls,"I had the exact same experience! The audience I was watching it with became uncomfortably noisy after (spoiler) Charlie died. After that moment, everyone wouldn't stop snickering at the scariest and most tense moments. I think it was because we were all jittery from fear.

I wouldn't say it was the scariest movie of all time, but it was definitely an enjoyable movie-watching experience.",8pg2ma
e0sylw7,"My take on the ending is that it's essentially arguing that... wouldn't it be nice if unthinkably horrific things (that happen to people in real life) like the death of your child, the onset of a brutal mental illness like DID, horrible trauma from witnessing death... could be explained away by blaming them on a cult conspiracy? The ending in the treehouse uses that uplifting music, the weirdly wondrous tone, which made me feel a weird sense of catharsis... the relief that at last this horrible mental anguish is over for Peter and his family. The guilt of being responsible for his sister's death. All of it. That there was a larger purpose for all these atrocities gives them a kind of meaning, even if it is a fucked up one.

But in the actual reality that you and I live in, terrible and traumatic things happen for a much more terrifying and horrifying reason -- no reason at all.

edit: Forgot to mention, this idea is kind of set up in Peter's first classroom scene. I forget the exact question the teacher asks, but its essentially about predestination: which would make you feel better... to feel like you were control of your fate or if Fate controlled you. (maybe someone remembers the line more exactly?) Which is kind of the question the ending begs... which would make you feel better, if Annie (while suffering from multiple personality disorder) killed her family after suffering the unimaginably horrific loss of her daughter... or if it was a demon ritual planned by a spooky cult. In this catch-22, the writer/director chose the ""happier"" ending.",8pg2ma
e0sapw7,"Well there were only two ways it could've gone and I think this was the best they could do with the paranormal option. I like that it made us think it was mental illness and I like that they hinted at what was happening from the start.

Also the Charlie incident was surely put in motion by the curse, when they placed the body in the attic. We know the body was stolen when Charlie was still alive and she also saw the weird light Peter did. The curse stuff was nicely weaved with the story.

I'm flattered",8pg2ma
e0cwwh6,"Curious, what's your first favorite?
",8pg2ma
e0df8wb,"Signed up just to try to interpret these questions!

1. I would have to assume that yes, beheading women is part of the ritual. It's interesting to note the book shows 3 heads decapitated, and Ellen, Charlie, and Annie all wind up as such

2. This leads into the answer for 3, but I'd have to assume the ceremony is a reward for Ellen being able to get an (albeit imperfect) host for Paimon, and that is her reward. 

3. The imperfect host is Charlie because they thought Charlie was going to be a boy. In fact, when Annie is digging in the old boxes, one of the welcome mats is for Charles. So my assumption is Ellen promised Paimon the second born child, possibly in the womb. That's why she got so close to Charlie when she moved in with the family. Annie also says there was a period when she didn't talk to her mom, then talked to her, then didn't talk to her, then they took care of her at the end. I wouldn't be surprised if the newfound relationship was when Annie was pregnant, and when it was discovered she was having a girl, they stopped talking again.

4. Good question, don't have a true answer other than pure speculation, which is maybe because she was the vessel for Paimon the cult didn't need her body. But unsure.

5. Yes Charlie was possessed for, at least, the majority of her life (or possibly entire life if the womb theory is correct). If I'm not misremembering, the bird smacked into the window after she was told to put the toy away and finish the quiz. So the implication is she caused something bad to happen after being told to do something she didn't want to do. And the decapitating the bird is in line with the headless symbolism for the cult.

5.5. I would say yes to all of that. In addition to the cake incident, Charlie eats a candy bar at the funeral and the parents talk about not having an Epipen with them. So it seems apparent that Charlie was destined to die from the allergy simply because of the carelessness of the family (which, again, may have been pre-ordained). Also, I believe the light pole had the Paimon symbol on it (would need to rewatch to confirm)

6. This is an open interpretation question. Personally, I think she knew her mom was into weird rituals and had a side of her that was intensely private (her surprise by how large the funeral crowd is), plus all the family tragedy they had led Annie to blame her mom for all that stuff, and felt responsible for not doing more. So like you said, if she didn't out and out put all dots together, subconsciously she did. Also, in the spirituality book she opened, it said you had to be open to accept these things. We saw Annie have a breakdown when Joan first did her seance, but then immediately accepted it and woke the family up to participate. 

7. All movie demon cults are usually naked, particularly the ritualistic rape scene from ROSEMARY'S BABY, so I feel like it was a bit of a winking nod to that. But yes pretty sure they were ghosts. 

8. It is a bit strange and tbh, one of the most forced parts of the movie for me. He absolutely would have been in trouble legally, even if the cops knew the incident itself was an accident, Peter still left the scene of an accident and didn't report it. Also, while it led to a great scene with Annie at the dinner table screaming at him, the lack of responsibility he took for it was nearly sociopathic.   ",8pg2ma
e0de82p,"4) We never see Charlie’s head and body reunite before the burial. Maybe the cultist collected it shortly after the accident. 

6) I thought about this the second time watching. Her actions were sketchy at times. Maybe she subconsciously remembers things about the cult from her childhood and acts out while sleepwalking.

e0iudbc,"See, I think Paimon had possessed him or at least  had a hand in triggering Peter’s mental issues after Charlie was decapitated. Peter is suffering from PTSD when we see him lying in bed emotionless as his mother finds his sisters dead body. We see him creepily standing outside of his parents room while his mother wails and prays for death. I think Paimon was present in these moments, causing his mental state to fester and disallowing him from taking responsibility for his act, an issue Annie brings up with him later at the dinner table. I think Paimon is present in that scene too, which is what causes Annie to be so forthcoming with her feelings towards her son. I think Paimon is meant to be seen as a cause or mechanism for the mental illness that Annie and Peter suffer from. I keep thinking back to the scene with Peter under the bleachers where he is smoking pot with his friends. This is after Charlie’s death. He has what looks like a panic attack, saying that he can’t breath and that he is having a reaction; very similar to what happened to Charlie before Paimon was expelled from her body. I’m still trying to figure out the importance of that scene under the bleachers. I think it was meant to show us that Paimon was attempting to control Peter following Charlie’s death but he was not in quite as vulnerable a state as was needed, so he exited from his body to attempt to affect other family members more directly. The next scene we see following the bleachers is the one with Peter standing in front of the house with his fists balled up as Annie looks on with pure hatred. I think this is meant to show that she is now under Paimon’s control as the next thing she does is drive to the grief counseling session. When she arrives at the session, she abruptly changes her mind and when Joan flags her down, Annie says that she shouldn’t be there and that she “really did forget some things.” I think Paimon influenced Annie to go to that meeting against her own will without her even realizing it. 

I think Paimon was present and guiding the characters in more scenes than we realize. ",8pg2ma

e4uvvp9,"Many theories point to the fact that a host needs to be decapitated to release the demon. This explains how all the hosts apart from Peter at the end were decapitated.

My gripe with the theory that Charlie was born possessed is that it doesn't seem to make sense or fit in with the lore.

I believe that Charlie was groomed by the grandmother to the point where she fully relied on her. Hence why when the grandmother dies Charlie seems upset and asks ""Who will look after me now?"". This triggers her breakdown in mental well-being which is a prerequisite to being possessed by the demon. She is shown as not being possessed yet as the lights (which represent the demon outside a host) are shown to be around charlie at the point where the grandma's grave is dug up and, as we find out later, is decapitated.

This is then followed by the pigeon scene which Chalie then decapitates to release the demon to enter her as a host.

The mother is next to be possessed. This contradicts many theories which seem to believe Peter is possessed at school. I believe Peter was still mentally too strong at this point, However, the Mother on the other hand was starting to show cracks. The mother initially finding Charlies body in the car was enough to start the breakdown process. Then the mothers nightmares of nearly killing peter following the freak out at the dinner table show her mental robustness is still declining. When her husband burns alive, it is enough to push her over the edge and make her susceptible to possession.

This is then followed by Peter, who at the sight of his own possessed mother decapitating herself to release the demon fully breaks down mentally, opening himself up to be a host for the demon. Hence the light entering his body following the window jump. His cracks are initially shown when he has flashbacks in class to his sisters death. His fathers body would push him further but still not completely break him yet. At this point he still has his mum. As we all know this somewhat changes with the chase and attic scene.

​

All the hosts lost someone they relied on. For example: Charlie lost her grandmother; who was her guardian, The mother lost her husband; who kept her mental well-being in check, and peter lost his mother and father.

Furthermore all the previous hosts were decapitated, be it post-mortem or during death. This suggests the demon can only move on once a host is decapitated. Ie Grandmother to pigeon, pigeon to Charlie, Charlie to Mother, Mother to Peter. All but Peter were decapitated.

e0en9v4,"I could be wrong but I think the demon may not be able to leave a host body until the body is decapitated. For instance, if the grandmaw initially hosted the demon, then the demon was stuck in her body until she was dug up and decapitated. At that point the demon was able to enter the most vulnerable of the family (Charlie), and led to her decapitation so he could 1) be free from a host body, and 2) to lead to Peter (the desired host body) becoming more vulnerable and able to be possessed. Peter was not immediately the most vulnerable, the mom was, so it entered her body instead and used her to break Peter down even more. Once Peter is vulnerable enough (throws himself out a window), the demon cuts off the head of its own host body (the mom) so that it can be released to enter Peter’s body.

Semi-unrelated but I haven't seen people talking about it much, it seems to me that they sent Paimon in the form of the bird. They seem to establish that cutting off the host's head frees the spirit. We see it happen with Anne, it's implied with Charlie, and Grandma's corpse is headless. So it seems like Charlie cutting the bird's head off uncorks it and let's the spirit out.

It also has to do with the type of movie it is. Understand it was produced by A24, who pump out divisive movies like this in the horror genre ( The Witch, It Comes at Night). These are movies that build an overwhelming sense of dread and anticipation, sometimes only to lead to nothing. there are some audience members who don't like this. When they see a zombie in the trailer, they're pissed when that zombie is taken from a dream sequence. horror, for whatever reason, has a lot to do with expectations. hereditary is best viewed free of expectations.

As for your wife, it depends on what horror movies (and other genres too) she DOES like. If she likes the other a24 movies, she should love this. Other movies that can serve as a decent barometer are: Suspiria, The Blair Witch Project, A Dark Song, The Wailing, Rosemary's Baby, It Follows. If she's more inclined to watch an Annabelle movie, one of the later Insidious films, Sinister, the Strangers, Dead Silence, Lights Out, then she probably won't enjoy this at much.

It should also be said the Hereditary succeeds as a drama as well, and some people may find that annoying -- that the movie isn't one-dimensional in it's servicing of emotion.

The possessed Annie sequence is very J-Horror/equal parts the well used Western horror trope of the spiderlike, crawling demon-person, and the glowing window of the treehouse reminds me of Amityville Horror. The statue of Paimon is probably a reference to something that I can't quite pin down other than the obvious demonic twisting of Catholic imagery. Also there's a mutilated bird (both BEHEADED and impaled in the shape of a cross with scissors) in ""The White Ribbon"" which is another film about the slow, perverse decline of a close knit community due to inexplicable forces that are possibly demonic in nature or maybe due to insanity or moral failings.

e0ihpjn,"1) I think what Aster is trying to say is that mental illness was once considered a form of demonic possession. In a sense, to put someone under demonic possession you need to push them into a psychotic episode. It could also be like a Buddha type of thing, where an old soul is born into a new body ignorant to its past lives. The only reason they performed an exorcism at all wasn't to transfer demon souls, but to vacate the brothers soul and replace it with the sister's soul. 

2) The only happen three times. Once with Charlie and twice with Peter. The third time we see a shadow roll over Peter's body then a light lands on it.

3) This didn't make much sense to me either. I just chalked it up to demonic trickery. It's also possible that both scenes were hallucinations and in both cases Annie started the fire.

4) Three possible explanations. She entered the attic by supernatural means. One of the cult members that we see in the attic let her in. And finally, that scene was just a manifestation of Peter having a hallucination.

The nuts being chopped were walnuts and they were part of the cake being served. That’s why Charlie had the reaction, not because the knife was unwashed.

-

When I thought that was the case, I appreciated that it was different than lots of supernatural horror that I have seen. That it was a story about mental illness rather than a simple demon possession affair; but I was wrong. There were so many small ""details"" that ended up being much simpler. For the most part the only ones who witness anything supernatural are Charlie, Annie and Peter, who we could suspect suffer from some sort of mental illness judging by Annie's family history; you might even call it *hereditary*. In fact aside from the seance, which are famously staged, only those three witness anything you might call supernatural. The Husband is not used as a pseudo Point-of-View character as extensively. Their symptoms get worse after Charlie's death and Annie especially is consumed by grief until in the end Annie kills her husband and drives Peter into such a state of paranoia that he jumps to his death. Instead they're being toyed with by a satanic spirit who wants Peter as its host.

-

I found the director's justification for this to be weak. ""People hate 'it was all a dream' endings"". As if having the story be lead by unreliable narrators would have resulted in that. Dream endings are bogus because they tend to end up undoing the last two hours of movie we sat through. The ending doesn't matter because none of it happened. That sort of ending makes an audience feel cheated. That would not have been the case with hereditary. Charlie is truly dead, Annie's husband is truly dead and she really did dig up her mother's corpse and store it in the attic. Peter really harmed himself at school and freaked out smoking pot with his friends; suffering from severe anxiety attacks. What we would see is the result of untreated mental illness rather than demonic possession. A logical, modern explanation to contrast the medieval theme of demonic possession. The audience does not need to be tricked; like any good detective film they were fed hints and apart from some small details they see what is happening. Up until the end with possessed-Annie climbing the walls and floating through the air there was nothing too wild happening that could not be explained by their illness.

In short, I wasn't a fan of what I saw.",8pg2ma
e1d6l5d,"I thought that at first too, but having worked with people with mental illness, I don't think I would've liked it if they ended it with the mom driven to be murderous. We don't need to stigmatize mental illness (especially schizophrenia) any further. ",8pg2ma
e1kfkzd,"I actually took the movie to be that the son and mom both had some psychosis going on. It doesn't flat out say it, but I think it is implied. Here is my reasoning as a medical student:

1) The title of the movie is ""Hereditary"". Mental disease is genetic and passed down in families. It is my theory that The mother, the Peter, and Charlie are all suffering from schizophrenia or a related disorder. The mom mentioned earlier in the movie that her brother (i think) had a mental disease. We also see the husband sending an email to someone saying he thinks his wife is starting to suffer from a.... leaving to believe he expected this to happen at some point in their life. The movie starts with the death of the Grandmother. Often times its a stress in someones life that causes symptoms to emerge. This can apply to the mother/son/and charlie. Charlie begins to have symptoms after the grandma dies, Peter begins to have symptoms after Charlie dies, the mom has symptoms throughout but gets exacerbated after charlies death. 

2) Visual Hallucinations: The mom sees figures in the dark that disappear when she turns the lights on, which is a symptom is schizophrenic or other diseases with psychotic features.

Charlie sees her grandma in the field after she dies, when her mom comes the grandma is no longer there.

The mom hangs on the roof behind peter in the corner and when he looks she is gone. Often times I have patients tell me they feel like someone is in the corner behind them but when they look they aren't there. He is afraid of his mother from the sleep walk incident so it would make sense if he was having some weird hallucinations about her. I've also had patients tell me they see a floating orb of light, which is similar to the light that charlie and peter both saw in the movie. 


3) Peter has auditory hallucinations throughout the movie. He hears the pop/click sound charlie used to make. He hears this click before the mom tries to summon her. He also hears the sound of the mom slicing her throat at the end of the movie earlier in the movie. At the end of the movie when the cult is talking to him you don't actually see anyone talking but only hear their voices. This is a common auditory hallucination patients have where they will have a group of voices talking to them. 

4) Catatonia. Peter is stuck with his arm raised in an upright position in class. This is also something we see sometimes with Schizophrenic patients where they appear paralyzed. It's a little different in real life.


4) Patients delusions are often related to real things in their life. I think the Grandmother was actually into some cult crap and the family knew about it. Because of this there delusions were related to this. I live in a very Catholic area and I have heard patients say similar things that they feel like they are the embodiment of Satan coming to earth to start a spiritual war with God, I also had a patient say they were a new King coming to rule over the USA and Mexico. Really bizarre stuff. So with that in mind I feel like the end of the movie could really be Peter in the middle of a psychotic episode due to all the recent stress in his life, and his knowledge of his grandmothers cult behavior is causing him to believe he is King Paimon. However we are seeing it from Peters perspective at the end and the movie doesn't flat out say anything and leaves it up to the viewer. Thats my take on it.

When Charlie was born, the grandmother was allowed to have a relationship with her. That created the familial bond that the grandmother chose to follow for the ritual. Paimon needs a male body, but the grandmother needed Charlie’s spirit to be in Peter. After all, Charlie said the grandma wanted her to be a boy. We saw that when we saw the door mat that says Charles that the grandma made. Charlie’s spirit was the key factor to the ritual’s success. Peter’s body is more of a surrogate. That’s why at the end the worshippers address the physical form of Peter as Charlie",8pg2ma
e0cg4aw,The grandmother was communicating with her on some level. There was that scene where she was drawn out to the backyard and saw her for a moment before Annie found her. Also the fact that she cut off the pigeon's head and later drew the pigeon's head wearing the crown that's put on her at the end of the film.,8pg2ma

Hence, the miniatures (the characters are all merely playthings to a higher power).",8pg2ma
e0dzk8w,"Charlie wasn't manipulated, she was possessed by the demon from the start.  The whole peanut allergy was an act accomplish the beheading--she was eating candy with peanuts earlier in the film.

e0e274l,Think supernaturally. When Peter is in bed right before that all goes down you see her climb through thin air nearly and when he's standing over his dad she dropped in behind them and then ends up chasing him from the corner in front of him to the left of the father's body. ,8pg2ma
e0etcax,"The picture of Paimon in the book shows him with heads, so it seems to be the way offerings are made. It also alludes to this being the way Paimon is taken from one body and able to enter another. He's in Charlie, she gets decapitated, then he enters Annie at the end, who cuts her own head off with piano wire when they have Peter cornered. The shadow and light thing signifying Paimon's presence doesn't come over and possess Peter until after you hear Annie's body hit the floor in the attic.",8pg2ma
e0et7qv,"I’m guessing she willfully took her life to start the process... and covered up as natural causes.  She left a note and admits as much.. ‘the sacrifices will be worth it’.

e0hklob,"Presumably Charlie had been an imperfect host since infancy, since the grandmother was allowed to interact with her.

2. The light is Paimon. Per various grimoires and The Lesser Key of *Solomon,* Paimon supposedly has different body forms and can travel as a sliver of light. It's the same light that trickles down Annie's face after her husband burns to death, entering her. By way of her grandmother breastfeeding her, it is assumed that Charlie carried Paimon inside her at varying points of her life as well as the story. The moment it becomes very obvious to Charlie that the light is here was when she heads out, walking toward her grandmother's apparition in the field. Remember that scene where she's sitting by fire in a white dress? That one.

e4wz6ud,"There was no ""link"" to the diary. There was no seance to connect with the dead spirit of Charlie. That was all a ruse to get them to do the ritual to get Paimon into Peter. It seems that Paimon just took that moment to kill the husband.

It really is just what you want out of the film, it is hard to argue for just insanity or mental illness without disregarding the seance for Charlie.

e0dpzvt,I think the lack of confrontation added a lot to the suspense. ,8pg2ma
e0dqogz,I wouldn't assume that it wasn't investigated and dealt with in some way. It's just not really important to include and would pointlessly breakup the flow of the film. ,8pg2ma
e0dpz3o,"No, because it’s not an important part of the story and thus was cut.",8pg2ma
e0dzwd1,"So I think there are two reasons why that wasn’t part of the movie. 1) not acknowledging the accident directly causes Peter’s guilt to fester. It’s like he is just supposed to continue his life as normal and can’t express the incredible pain he is experiencing. 2) I think there was an intentional effort to not have characters outside of the family address Charlie’s death to make them seem totally isolated in their grief. Peter goes back to school and no one around him acts differently despite the fact his sister just died in a violent accident. Annie continues to be pressured by her gallery to finish her work, despite having just lost her daughter (the voicemail she receives from the gallery offers vague condolences and support but is clearly trying to push her to meet their deadline). Even if there was a police investigation, I think it would have come to the conclusion that the whole thing was an accident, and to include it in the movie would have disrupted the tension.",8pg2ma
e0ixe45,Definitely a tribute to Rosemary’s Baby and the wackiness of the Satanists at the end of that movie. The absurdity and familiarity makes it more horrifying IMO,8pg2ma
e0j09bk,Honestly I didn't have a problem with the speech so much as I had a problem with the book part. I felt like if that book didn't telegraph what was happening then that final scene would've been shocking and that speech would've been like the Black Phillip scene from The Witch,8pg2ma
e0ixbx2,"I thought it was pretty ominous and chilling and extremely psychedelic that they had that there at the end  honestly- like the Tibetan throat singing in the background and the whimsical music and all the people just bowing and the beheaded bowing Mom and Grandma and the statue and the bird??  All in the treehouse ? And those naked entities standing around everywhere. The whole thing was completely outlandish and I feel like the narration completely solidifies exactly who he is and what he means to his worshippers. It’s like their prayer to him. Like that was the ending of the storybook. I personally felt it was more along those lines than spelling it out to the audience.

Then they decided to splice three or four scenes together using her crying exactly the same way, and that was hilarious to me. Reminded me of scenes from American Dad.

And it was stuff like that that was really unfortunate. Comes from a very narrow viewpoint. ",8pg2ma

e0n2aul,I enjoyed the ending myself. I feel like if it ended any other way - ei Peter was developing psychosis - it would have been a bit of a cop out. With this ending it adds the layer of manipulation and conspiracy from his dead grandma which is immensely intriguing and disturbing. ,8pg2ma
e0n7xlf,Basically the ending of The VVITCH,8pg2ma
e0n8v6m,"It was definitely something to do with the grandmother being apart of a cult with its own religion. During the funeral, the mother speaks about being surprised to see new faces. I think those new faces were all cult members. The grandma and Joan planned everything. The grandma forced her daughter to have the son even though the daughter didn’t want it because she probably knew what was going on and that’s the reason she cut off contact with her. Joan was also the one who dug up the body and tricked the mother into preforming the ritual. I wouldn’t be surprised if Joan drowned her grandson and son either. Of course this is all just my speculation though. It’s fun to put pieces together 

edit: a word ",8pg2ma
e0nu64s,"I feel like that's the case with every movie. No matter what the ending was, once they explained it, it would have lost that whole mystery aspect. I think they had two choices, leave it as it is or make it cryptic as hell so nobody could understand it. The movie was so good that I didnt mind the whole possession ending, I thought it was decent. Plus the whole thing was being set up from the beginning, it made sense. But thats just my thought.",8pg2ma

e0fe9b5,"The thing about storytelling, especially with movies, is things can have a deeper meaning. The title Hereditary is implicating two things - the mental illness of the family and the special nature to the cult. 

Just because the writer used the medium of religious/cult horror, doesn't mean that's the only story they wanted to tell. Because this movie IS about psychosis and how it can effect a family, albeit to the extreme. If that was the only story they wanted to tell, they wouldn't have used the obvious parallels to mental disorder. 

It's similar to The Babadook and Rosemary's Baby. They're both movies that have a deeper meaning, but taken at their face value could seem like they're just supernatural horror movies. ",8pg2ma
e0fehtx,"I'm still on the mental illness train. I think the events of the film are most obviously taken literally, but I viewed it as a ""descent into madness"" a la *The Shining* and *Eraserhead*. Mental illness explains a ton of the events, especially since many of the supernatural happenings occured when characters were alone. Additionally, traumatic events can trigger more severe bouts with mental illness so Charlie's death could have triggered reactions from both the mom and son. The dad never really sees anything supernatural (the stuff during the conjuring does get weird, probably the weakest part of my argument), and any other characters really just see Peter freaking out. 

 I think Annie resents her mother for passing on severe mental illness. I think she blames her mother for her brother's death (maybe the mother refused to find treatment for him). Maybe the mother killed the father. I think the woman from the grief session could be imaginary (or maybe she is a real person but certain events are hallucinated), and the grandmother's notebook is probably another hallucination. Maybe the mother has an episode and tries to kill her son, which triggers an episode in him where he imagines his mother as more supernatural.

In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed the imagery in the film, and I think it's awesome how it is inspiring so much discussion.",8pg2ma

One was a kaleidoscope-type picture that would reveal clues (scenes) of the film.  In one of those there was a lil baby with the crowd..I thought uh-oh this is a bit foreboding.... also a couple weeks before the film came out I felt like I already knew too much of the plot themes because Darren was already starting to explain it after Venice--the mother/house is actually mother earth, the story follows Bereshit (Genesis)...so I was pretty prepared when I went to go see it.  But that ending was the absolute most gut-wrenching scene I have ever seen. I left feeling sick.  I went back to see it once or twice more and then decided I liked it, because I could really relate to the mother in the film, as a person in creative arts myself.  (People coming on to your project and trying to take advantage of you, destroy your project, screw you over etc.).  So in the end I loved it, but not sure I'll see it again soon.

So the really fucked up idea was that they put a 13 year old's consciousness into her older brother, and showed the headless bodies of her mother and grandmother. The cult had to explain to the demon who it was, so I presume the demon sees itself as the daughter of a family",8pg2ma

My favorite horror film of the last 10 years is *It Follows*. Plenty of people don't enjoy that film, and that's okay. It's okay that I enjoy a film that others don't enjoy, but I always see people like you getting trashed for having an opinion by childish moviegoers. I mean, come on people, even *The Shining* isn't universally acclaimed.

With that said, I do strongly disagree with you. *Hereditary* was full of interesting shots, clever misdirection, and a great sense of dread. I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the entire film.

> Also Charlie was Paimon from the second we saw her, right?

The Writer and Director has confirmed that Charlie has been possessed just about her entire life. Regarding who was speaking during the seance, Charlie or Paimon, we can not know.

> And did anybody else go back and see the writing on the chalkboard when the teacher is talking and Peter is looking down at his phone?

There's a lot of foreshadowing in this movie. At the party some teenagers were watching a video of a guillotine in action, Peter drives past a telephone pole with Paimon's seal etched into it, the classes discuss fate, Annie notes how many strange faces were present at the funeral (cultists), Annie tells a story of how her brother committed suicide and blamed the mother 'for putting people inside him', Annie would never harm her children - Peter hates her for the paint thinner incident - Annie ends up being totally innocent of everything that occurred to Peter etc etc",8pg2ma

I mean, Charlie's name is a predominantly male name for christ sake.

I understand people going ""this was such a strong family drama until the horror hit"" - but that's the idea. The director has stated that, in order for the horror work, the drama has to work to - that, if the horror elements were removed, the film could still function. 

As someone who loved The VVitch, this is exactly the film I wanted it to be. The score, the performances, the cinematography - it's like everything was designed with the sole purpose of making viewers uncomfortable.

Again not a new theme, but well done.

To me this was a masterfully made horror movie. And I’m not one to jump onboard the hype train for new horror, as I’m usually disappointed by all the latest darlings of the genre. I thought the Witch was boring and not scary. It Follows had good moments but ultimately was silly. I hated the Babadook. This hit all the right notes for me.",8pg2ma

Also I felt the VVitch was more coherent. We knew about the witch from the start after seeing her kidnapp and grind up the baby, that set the tone for the rest of the film.

Then a bunch of cloaked figures shuffle toward them from the backyard aaand The End...

e0dxl1i,"I think that the problem some people have is that they're separating the movie into two parts. The first 90 minutes and the last 30. 

The ending is shocking, but it doesn't just overwrite everything that happened before. You can look at things like the mother trying to kill her children or the way that she built ""honest"" miniatures of  a life where there were so many lies as clues to what is going to happen. 

I also think there is are several possible deeper meanings. The biggest being the subtext of the ""coronation speech"" at the end of the movie. In a film all about what we pass on to our children and loved ones, we see the fabled male heir watch as his loved ones die and sacrifice themselves so that he can become this mythical figure that will solve all problems and cure all pains. 

If you've ever had a parent that used you as their vehicle to make up for their own failures (yo) I think that message hits especially hard. 

On top of that, you have the modern idea of being able to look into our past to see what medical and mental maladies we may encounter based on our genetics. The idea being that our lives are more mapped out than we think. In the case of Hereditary, a lot of the occult stuff is an allegory for mental health issues (which are also literally referenced). They are destined to be on this path that will leave them broken, and the film's final minutes show how hard it is to watch everything slip away because you really don't have control over what is happening in your life (there is also a classroom scene in the movie where the teacher is talking about whether having a choice or the absence of choice is a greater tragedy which foreshadows this). 

I think there is a lot to this movie that isn't going to be fully unpacked by the crowd that initially bought into the ""scariest movie ever hype."" I know my crowd also laughed at awkward moments and were generally horrible. However, there is a lot to this film and I do think the scares it is going for are incredibly effective. ",8pg2ma

To her its a coping mechanism like people eating for comfort. She falls into her creative influence to overcome challenges in her life. The modeling also serves as a means to showcase the families being manipulated. the model creator makes it to their whim and in this case Paimon's influence of the cult is reflected in the manipulation of the family towards a suitable host for his return. The mom loses her shit completely when she destroys her models as they are grounding her sanity.

e8k67iv,"I'm upvoting because you shouldn't be downvoted for having an unpopular opinion, especially when you take the time to provide examples, but I strongly disagree as well. 

I didn't experience any of the technical sound issues you stated and found the whole soundscape to be very refreshing, as it felt largely led by the story. The sound enhanced the scare, it didn't make the scare, which is a criticism I have with a lot of modern horror films. 

I'm interested in hearing more about how you feel showing Charlie's decapitated head felt exploitative. For me, it feels like the very best moment to show such a gruesome image. We spent so much time focused on Peter processing what happened, the anticipation of the parents discovering Charlie's fate. Imagining the sheer horror of what Annie saw, then WHAM, the cut to her rotting head... To me that's great storytelling. We're given ""2+2"" and the result is something even greater instead of being shown ""4"", which is another criticism of many horror films and films in any genre. 

Lastly, predictability. To me, this has more to do with how the viewer chooses to experience the story. I would make guesses as to what might happen next in the plot, right or wrong it didn't sure my experience. I feel strongly that there were enough possibilities for where the plot *could go* that I never felt let down or that the climax and conclusion were plain to see. I really believed Joan to be a well meaning friend, someone who just wanted to help. Her true nature was a shock to me. While it may have been more obvious to others, I think the film did an excellent job of keeping you guessing. ",8pg2ma

I've seen a lot of movies, and a lot of horror movies, and *very* few have achieved this level of polish, plot building, and utter unsettling terror and excitement. This is quite possibly the best horror movie I've ever seen.

I don't think the movie was predictable at all, and I think you're giving it an unfair assessment there. There were plenty of surprises, in terms of plot, direction, and scares. I haven't seen Rosemary's Baby, maybe that's what I'm missing here, but even if it really is at derivative as you say (although it makes Babadook, which I really liked, look tame, and Paranormal Activity is downright trash by comparison), Hereditary was executed brilliantly, and everything tied together very nicely. There were out-of-context clues peppered throughout the film, and once you realize exactly what is happening, it's very satisfying to have all the pieces click together in your head.",8pg2ma

e0rytoe,"I gave it a solid 7 too

I loved the first hour of family drama/tragedy with glimpses of a psychological thriller and some little bits of horror/creepy stuff  


And then the film descends into a horror film while not exactly paying off in a satisfactory way except some moments that were genuinely disturbing for me (piano wire)   


Up until the whole seance thing, it was going okay and then I saw the film cling on lazy narrative techniques and convenient storytelling (how annie discovers the twist and how they throw info about paimon and his motivations in your face) and that broke the subtle and classy storytelling style of the film and then the fire scene and all that stuff felt a bit like it was dragging and things were happening for sake of shock value   


Then the end happened and I was kind of content because the end made sense and they wrapped it up well 

But now that I think about it, many things happened for a reason and that's good but there were still some parts where the film got lazy as to how to resolve its problems and how to convey information and fell back to lazy storytelling in last act   


as for the being scary, it is more creepy, hopeless and disturbing than the traditional kind of scares   


Even though the film made it's horror aspect work, it felt kind of unnecessary but they managed to make it work while sacrificing writing quality a little bit

- good to superb acting all around especially from lead actress Toni Collette who is an absolute powerhouse in it.

- very good score. It’s not overpowering but it’s ever present similar in a way to the voices that someone suffering from schizophrenia may hear. Distant but there. (I do know someone with schizophrenia) 

- excellent use of camera techniques and movement. It starts moving rather slow but as things start to happen in the movie the movement and camera effects become more rapid.

e0dj8xm,It was always planned for Charlie to be decapitated as the light pole had the cult's markings on it,8pg2ma
e0epqup,"I've brooded on this for a bit now and here are my thoughts.

Paimon needs chaos and vulnerability to attain more power, and effectively and absolutely take control of a host.

The cult was eager to facilitate this but due to Ellen's dementia and strained relationship with Annie it was difficult to take the simple route of directly going for Peter. Annie subconsciously suspected Ellen of wrongdoing due to her brother's eventual insanity, which is why she sheltered Peter from Ellen. Subconsciously she attempted to miscarry Peter because she didn't want him to suffer the same fate as her brother. She continued to subconsciously attempt to kill him out of love - she didn't want Ellen getting her hands on him.

For some reason, maybe partly because Charlie was a girl and not feeling any danger, Annie relented and allowed Ellen to become close with her daughter. 

Ellen, along with the cult, hatches a plan to create chaos and destruction in the family so that they all become vulnerable. This begins with Ellen's death, making Charlie depressed as she just lost someone she was very close with. Charlie being down and wanting to reunite with Ellen, becomes vulnerable to Paimon's powers. I suspect that Charlie is coerced in on the cult's plan to be decapitated, and is imagining her own fate when decapitating the bird.

Due to careful planning by the cult and a bit of Paimon's (continually growing stronger) supernatural powers, Charlie's decapitation occurs. 

Peter, Steve and Annie are weakened by this, and the cult and Paimon (feeding off their vulnerability), slowly starts manipulating them to create further disruption within the family.

Annie never wanted to admit that her mother was capable of what she was doing even though deep down inside her the signs were all there - books in the attic, secrecy, brother's insanity, cult's symbol on Joan's welcome mat etc. Once she does consciously connect the dots she still thinks she might be able to save Peter by burning Charlie's notepad.

Steve seeing all this destruction is pushed over the edge when he perceives that his wife has become insane. This vulnerability in Steve gives Paimon the power to burn him alive. 

Annie seeing Steve's death allows Paimon full control of her.

Annnnnd likewise, seeing his dad's death and mum's insanity make's Peter fully vulnerable for Paimon to take over his preferred male host and instill Charlie's mind that has been groomed to accommodate Paimon's ambitions. 

Someone noted that Paimon had three decapitated heads in his picture which I assume means that everything that happened went exactly according to the demon king's plan. Maybe he could have done things a bit more simpler but due to loving chaos he chose to have fun with the family first - Just like Annie's craft, the family was a set of objects that could be designed and manipulated as the demon king pleased.

The film is really relentless both in its horror and also in the interpersonal drama between the characters in it. The acting is so good and the characters are so well drawn that you can't help but feel for them. Conversely, in most other horror movies the main characters are either blank everyman-ish ciphers that we as the audience are supposed to fill in (Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby, for example) or they're reductive stereotypes played by young, new actors that we're kinda glad to see chopped to bits (any slasher movie ever).

But with this film, these characters are *people*, and they are going through some shit. Shit that we can all either identify as things that have happened to us or that we are afraid (in the real life horror sort of way) could happen to us. 

I needed to know that [there was some cooky, horror-movie trope explanation for what happened that I could sink my teeth into. I needed to know that this wasn't a family with some really shitty genetic baggage and some profound mental illness just destroying each other. I already have to deal with mentally ill family members, I've struggled with depression myself as well, and the fear of those diseases ravaging you or causing your family members to harm you is very real. The fear of being abandoned by a parent because you've brought harm to their favorite child is real.

e0l7g5p,"I think the movie still reads as a story of psychosis. The film is told from Annie and Peter's perspective, so as their psychosis escalates as does what is shown to the audience. 

My theory is that nothing supernatural actually occurred. I do think the cult members are all real, but the demon they worship is *literally* just in everyone's heads. In fact, I think grandmother founded the cult based on her own delusions of grandeur. Anyhow, Annie is the one that drew in Charlie's sketchbook, which is hinted to us because she is the only one there to witness it. When she tries to burn the sketchbook she sets on fire, but the fire doesn't leave a burn trail. She doesn't even seem to *feel* the fire until she looks at it. I think this was just another part of her delusions. In the finale she douses Steve in paint thinner and immolates him then waits for Peter to come down.

Peter, following the trauma of killing his sister, is clearly experiencing a psychotic break. He experiences psychosomatic symptoms similar to Charlie's allergic reaction. He has several audio-visual hallucinations such as seeing lights on the walls, Joan calling out to him in public but no one else hears or sees her, and his reflection smiling at him. In the final class room scene he flexes his arm and appears stuck in that position. Involuntary movements and loss of voluntary movement are both symptoms of schizophrenia. I believe the final scene Annie attacks Peter in a psychotic rage and in defense he beheads her with a piano string (or she beheads herself). He tries to hide from her in the attic, but the cult members hiding in there to spook him let her in. She isn't actually floating, but the events are so intense that Peter perceives them as supernatural.

The switching of perspectives between the mother and son I thought would tie more into the theme of hereditary mental illness (since it did sound like the grandmother had her share of it), but instead we get shots of things that the son never sees, like Annie glued to the ceiling and banging on the attic door, or Charlie crawling around on the walls.](#spoiler)

Also his reaction to his sisters accident was not nuero-typical ,it was strange he never got to speak about it or go for counselling and yet continues smokin weed. The dinner table where he tries to reach out to his mother is brilliant as that’s his only attempt ever which fails just like classmates around him feel nothing is wrong and mistake his mental breakdown as maybe a physical illness. 

However all this aside , there is enough proof of the cult existing and they had targeted Annie’s Brother years back who had killed himself out of schizophrenia, However Peter maybe accepts the reality and just strangely participates, he no longer tries to even slap himself out of his nightmare , just becomes a cold emotionless person much like the night of the accident unable to react any more. 

Since the movie is both able to manage it to keep it as a hallucination as well as have good enough proofs of the existence of the cult - it gets my 5 stars for such detailed character writing ",8pg2ma
e0dsscs,"The mother definitely shows signs of mania too, which can also manifest with grandiosity, inability to sleep, and pressured/rapid speech. The film also did a very interesting job of highlighting certain aspects of schizophrenia. I’ve had patients describe symptoms involving the appearance of light as a hallucination which was a recurring aethetic in the film. Especially the classroom scene where he’s watching the light move around the room and then is watching his reflection which really seemed brilliantly executed. Later, when the son shoots his hand in the air and is frozen and contorted, is also a real symptom of psychosis called catatonia, and patients can freeze in uncomfortable positions just like that and maintain it for long periods of time. 

From a healthcare perspective, I was just frustrated that nobody was seeking help for anybody else (why didn’t that son get sent to the hospital?!?!). But I was really impressed with a lot of the film’s details.",8pg2ma

As far as how scary it was, I can't relate with the ""It was the scariest movie I've ever seen!"" people. There were some very great, tense moments but they didn't stick with me.

e0m99u3,"I'm really glad you made this comment, because people in this thread are ready to pounce on people for not liking the movie, and claiming that they're not smart enough to understand it and want more generic horror movies.

But this is what I'm feeling too. I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, I didn't see the trailer that apparently is misleading. While I was watching it it felt like a very well-done, well-acted allegory of grief, guilt, and mental health (the latter of which I thought the title was referring to, not demonic possession). And that is why the final 15 minutes of the film were so disappointing to me. I was way more invested in the family dynamics, the different ways each member was grieving, and the ways schizophrenia was playing a part in the more supernatural aspects of the film (before it just literally became a movie about a demon cult).

I was feeling like it was a movie akin to The Babadook [which took a physical manifestation of a monster and made it about grief and learning to live with it instead of trying to ignore it.](#spoiler)

But instead it was really about Paimon all along, and that's just not satisfying to me, because it cheapens everything about the movie that I was enjoying. I really, really liked the first 95% of the movie, I thought it was excellent. But that ending was not a satisfying conclusion to the story I thought I was watching - and I admit, that is definitely partly on me for having those expectations, but I don't think that means people who didn't like the demonic cult ending were too simple-minded to understand the film. Overall I thought the film was very good, I just wish they shot a different ending.",8pg2ma
e0dki7a,"I couldn't disagree more. I thought the satanic mythos was executed perfectly and was a refreshing twist the recent trend of horror films attempting to be artsy and intentionally ambiguous. I also haven't seen anyone that was confused or thought the plot was abstract. The story was pretty clear throughout if you're paying attention, and is made obvious when Paimon was first introduced in the book. The relevant passage was literally highlighted. Then you have Joanie literally trying to cast Peter out of his body. The ADR wasn't necessary, but I thought it worked really well in this case along with the ""crowning of the king"" ceremony and soundtrack. 

Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I'm impressed with how masterfully they were able to craft an excellent psychological thriller that transformed in a traditional horror movie of the same caliber, or even better. ",8pg2ma

e0l2wot,"I'm really sorry you didn't get much from this film.  I loved every minute, haven't seen a horror movie so rich in symbolism since The Shining.  

The first act is intentionally drawing you in to this family tragedy, it does a TON of meticulous domino setting for the final act, is meant to endear you to the characters, foreshadows the inevitability of the conclusion, establishes the decapitation theme that is prominent through the film, and probably does a dozen other things i haven't consciously registered through 2 viewings. 

Admittedly the scares are few and far between in the first 2/3s of the film, and I can see why it would turn a lot of people off especially when the film is compared to The Exorcist by the hype machine.  But I have to respectfully disagree that nothing happened in the first half.  Almost nothing supernatural happened, but the horrific chain of events that kicks off after Charlie's death really wouldn't be as impactful if not for the time and care put into the first half of the film.

Alex Wolff was brilliant at moments but there were times I did not find him believable.  Collette was probably the highlight performance for me.

During that moment, the screen turns to the people looking at her and at the left side of one shot, Joan’s sitting and looking at Annie attentively. So, the understanding here is that Annie was guarding Peter from her mother and as we know, per occult text shown in the film, Paimon is more likely to live in a vulnerable person’s body. Annie guarding her son and him not being aware of his grandmother’s messed up priorities may have given him a shield he longer had as a teenager.

the feel of the film for me was polanskis, *the tenant* and oddly enough, the film with Rex Harrison *unfaithfully yours*,,, plans can be fantasized but snafus happen. in hereditary's case, paimon needed to run the plan for the mostly bumbling inept cult.
also, the whole town is the cult, that's why people are rather meh when joan is doing her expellant thing in public from afar. no cops, no doctors, insurance companies come a knocking. it's almost as if the whole town is like salt lake city but with Mormons,,,, waita minute... ",8pg2ma

Babadook is another good example:  it’s obviously a movie about a monster tormenting the mother and son, but it can also be watched as a story about depression and loss of a loved one.

e0euu08,"The way I interpreted the whole notion of decapitation in this film was that it represented the owner(head) of the vessel(body). It was shown throughout the film such as when charlie cut off the head of the bird and installed it onto another body. In some of Charlie's drawings there seems to be bird heads on bodies that's oddly not a bird body. Or when Charlie was at the party she was playing with a toy with a head that didn't match the body. It was analogy to the whole soul and body, in which the mind represents the soul. Towards the end of the film Peter was exposed to countless traumatic events that's meant to unhinge him and break him down. The hidden message in this film is brilliantly trying to say that the person's mind is essentially the soul. 

Notice also how the grandmother, Charlie and Annie were all decapitated. Charlie was possessed but that came after the news of the grandmother's grave being dug up, and presumably decapitated by the cult as well. Following this presumption, it's possible that the grandmother was also possessed before she died and had to be decapitated so the spirit can be released from the body. The spirit then wondered into Charlie's body and after she was decapitated the mother starts to show signs of supernatural traits such wall climbing etc. Right before Peter was about to lose his head (figuratively) and jump out the window, the mother(Paimon) forcibly cuts her own head off and releasing the body of the evil spirit(sickness in the mind).

I think the diaromas symbolize them not being in control of their fate, the cultists are controlling them which goes with Peters teacher talking about which is more tragic not having a choice or having one.

>Why show us Annie smashing the attic door with her face floating on the ceiling?

Cause its a good scene thats why

>Sick exposition dumps at the end

I did not think this was as bad as you do, I think it couldve done without it as paimon was shown in the book but its really not a big deal

>The grandma's corpse was in the attic...why 

The gravesite was desecrated by the cultists and they had to put it somewhere nearby where no one would find it before the ritual was complete. Its also the reason Steve says ""whats that smell"" an hour before its revealed to be the body.

>Why would Steve hide the desecration of Grandma's grave from Annie when Annie herself admits she isn't broken up over Grandma's death? It's not like he's hiding it from his kids

He doesnt want to upset her or freak her out??? Is this not obvious?

>Sleepwalking subplot unnecessary and didn't go anywhere.

Its a character trait not really a subplot. Plus I think it explains past behavior like her trying to kill her kids, not because she wants them dead she doesnt want paimon summoned (something she knows subconsciously).

>ilm wanted its less in-your-face creepy stuff (guy smiling at Charlie at the funeral, grinning Peter reflection in the classroom, fire outside the house Charlie goes to, the aforementioned excellent 'Annie discovers the body' scene) but also pulled shit like spooky seances, magic flying housewives, the piano wire thing, nightmare sequences, and jumpscare birds. You can't have your cake and eat it too, movie. Well, you can, if you pull it off better, but you either couldn't or didn't.

There was like 1 jumpscare and I dont see why they cant have both, why cant you have ""cutting your head off with a piano wire"" and ""creepy guys smiling"" in the same movie? What makes those things mutually exclusive?

>Why did Joanie go to the school to yell at Peter to ""get out""? What was she doing? Wasn't she part of the cult? Why was she warning them?

It was definitely part of the ritual, she wasnt warning him she was speaking in greek or something as well. Genuinely dont know how you dont get this

>Was Charlie possessed by Paiman the entire movie, up until her death? If so, why would a demon of knowledge knowingly eat nuts which would threaten his vessel? And it's not much of a demon when his vessels are weak to allergies and telephone poles.

Entire movie, she never cried even when born, she was possessed since she was born. And paimon doesnt know that he is a demon, its the same reason they tell Peter at the end of the film who he is.

>Plot-revealing album

All it revealed was that the grandma knew joanie, how is that plot revealing?

>What does the title mean? What runs in the family? The cult thing? That was just the grandma.

Clearly was not, Annie talks about how almost all her family members died horribly, her brother died from suicide when the grandma was trying to put ""people in him,"" her father died of starvation, plus (and this is an assumption) paimon was only passed on genetically, it went from grandma to charlie to annie and finally to Peter. All the bad shit, excluding Steve, only happens to the family members on her grandmas side.

>Why bother tormenting Peter in the house? What was the purpose? Is scaring him necessary for possession? Then what explains Annie? or Charlie?

Its explained that the host needs to be in a weak state, so yes it was necessary for posession. Annie was in a weak state what are you talking about, she just thought she was about to die then saw her husband go up in flames, after her daughters head got decapitated by a fucking pole, I would assume shes weak and charlie got posessed as a child.

>Why would Grandma write a note to her daughter (who might not even see it) explaining that the suffering would be greatly rewarded in the end if Annie's death was going to happen anyway?

This is fair tbh, but its all fated right? Paimon knows the future he would know that if grandma wrote a note if her daughter would see it.

>Skeptic being skeptical even in the weirdest of circumstances

All Steve sees is a glass break and another one move, he doesnt really see or experience all the terrible shit happening to his wife or son, I think its normal for people in such a high stress situation to try to pretend the world is rational and makes sense and there isnt a demon trying to kill them.

>Anyone notice there were way more cultists outside the house than there were in the treehouse at the end? Are they just chilling outside waiting to bow at the feet of a severed head idol?

Uh... yes? Plus they are there to make sure the entire summoning ritual works in addition to wanting to be there to see Paiman take a new body.

e1q2b94,I feel like for a lot of these you’re reaching so hard.,8pg2ma
e1pukmj,"> What does the title mean?  

My guess would be that it’s a reference to Annie thinking that mental illness ran in her family (in reality it was probably just the whole Paimon thing). But I wouldn’t get too hung up on the title anyway; it might not even be the director’s choice.



> Diorama motif didn't mean anything and didn't go anywhere, only seemed to exist to excuse interesting shot choices like the final shot and the instant day-night cut later in the film.  

I agree that it felt like a bit of a missed opportunity. But in addition to the interesting shots, I think it gave us a window into Annie's mind - for most of the film she's trying really hard not to let anyone know how upset she is, yet the dioramas clearly reflect her increasing obsession with the death of her mother and daughter. I also saw them as a sort of metaphor for control - the miniatures allow Annie to feel like she is in control of her life, down to the tiniest little detail, and yet her actual life is spiraling into chaos.

Also, along the theme of control, Annie and her family are being controlled by outside forces, much like the dolls in her dioramas. Thinking about this more, I kinda take back what I said about it being a missed opportunity. It was subtle and remained subtle throughout the film, but I don't really have a problem with that.


> Why did Joanie go to the school to yell at Peter to ""get out""?  

This definitely wasn’t a friendly warning. She was saying some kind of incantation to him. I'm not sure why it was partially in English though. Then again, the words written around the house were in the English alphabet, so maybe their incantations work regardless of the language.



> Really? Spooky seance? Plot-revealing album? Skeptic being skeptical even in the weirdest of circumstances?  

There were definitely some cliches, but what made them work for me was the way the characters reacted. Their fear seemed very real. They weren’t just suddenly convinced, nor were they *completely* skeptical. I read Steve’s ongoing reluctance more as fear and denial than skepticism. A skeptic would have been dismissive and way less freaked out than he was.



> Was Charlie possessed by Paiman the entire movie, up until her death? If so, why would a demon of knowledge knowingly eat nuts which would threaten his vessel? And it's not much of a demon when his vessels are weak to allergies and telephone poles.  

The question of when, if ever, Charlie was “just Charlie” or Paimon or some combination us definitely open for me, maybe intentionally so. But either way her death was most definitely not an accident. Either Paimon-as-Charlie or some external force relating to Paimon or the cult orchestrated her death. Remember the symbol on the telephone pole? Charlie either intentionally ate the cake or was somehow coerced into doing so. (Or another possibility, my pet suspicion: she wasn’t actually allergic to nuts at all, and could just fake the reactions at will.) And the reason for threatening the vessel is explained - Paimon wants a male body. Remember Charlie saying that her grandma wanted her to be a boy?



> Why show us Annie smashing the attic door with her face floating on the ceiling? Peter doesn't know that she's smashing it with her face (and iirc that she can even float). It's only showed because the audience gets something out of it.  

Not sure I understand the point here. Are we only allowed to see things in movies if the characters see them?



> The grandma's corpse was in the attic...why?  

As Joan said, the “whole family” has to be in the house for the seance/summoning to work.  



> Why would Steve hide the desecration of Grandma's grave from Annie when Annie herself admits she isn't broken up over Grandma's death? It's not like he's hiding it from his kids.  

I don’t know but I would guess that even if she wasn’t totally upset about the death, she may very well have been upset about the body getting desecrated and exhumed for god knows what reason. He probably also suspected she was struggling more than she let on. I don't remember when it was revealed that the kids knew, but maybe they found out by accident.



> Sleepwalking subplot unnecessary and didn't go anywhere.  

If nothing else, it served to explain why Peter didn't really trust his mom and dismissed some of the signs that something supernatural was going on as her messing with him or going crazy.

> So, the seance was actually a ritual to summon or make a pact with Paimon? Then why was creepy stuff happening prior to the seance? What did the seance cause that wasn't already happening?  

I'm not sure we're supposed to exactly understand the mechanics here, but it seems likely that the cult had powers other than simply moving Paimon around from vessel to vessel. I would guess the grandma's spirit was sort of haunting the house, maybe partially because her body was there, and the seance brought Charlie/Paimon's spirit back.",8pg2ma
e1rplw5,"Just got out of the theater here. I agree with this almost completely! I was really trying to understand the movie and get into it but just couldn't. Although some scenes did have me at the edge of my seat, like the buildup to Charlie's death and the dinner fight scene, some of the more ""horrifying"" scenes seemed too weird and forced (Peter's possession at school; I agree, where did that come from?), and things quickly fell apart from there. During one of the quiet scenes when Peter wakes up in the house our theater even started clucking. Possessed Annie floating up into the treehouse also got everyone laughing at how ludicrous the situation was.

e1u18nm,"Obviously you're entitled to your opinions, I mostly just thought this movie was tortuous to watch, in that it terrified and disturbed me, I'll try to shed light on some of your questions.

- the grandma had been trying to summon Paimon through her offspring; that's why 'mental illness' ran in her family, remember she said her brother had hung himself and blamed his mum for putting voices in his head. The title relates to this

- I don't totally get the dioramas either, but I think it kind of tied into Annie's weird way of dealing with morbidity, she made models of seemingly all the worst moments of her life. 

- I think Joan was more so yelling at peter to leave his own body so that Paimon could take over, it definitely wasn't a rescue attempt

- Charlie was Paimon, if you didn't notice, the first time they drove past the street pole that killed her it bore that cultists symbol on it, they needed the host to be a man but Paimon was born into Charlie, who said her grandma wanted her to be a boy 

- I think they showed Annie smashing her head because it mirrored what was happening to Peter in the classroom before, to show they were possessed by the same being, also it was creepy.

e1pchhg,"This comment sums up how I felt about the movie.

Sorry y’all, but there were WAY too many nonsensical things—things that broke the internal logic of the movie—for me to enjoy it or take it seriously.

My biggest gripe: if you are a King of Hell, why the frick would some white lady keeping her son away from her grandmother prevent you from possessing his body? Especially when your spirit appears to be an aura of light that can float about wherever it pleases?

Also, if Paimon was possessing Charlie the whole time, how come she saw the aura of light that, apparently, was the spirit of Paimon? But then also was conscious as Charlie inside Peter’s body at the end? But also didn’t realize somehow that she was a King of Hell the whole time?

I can’t handle movies that don’t stick to their internal rules. Cool visuals and some great acting, but what a disappointing script, plot, and concept. Totally half-baked and overhyped.

e0bsann,The entire movie is supernatural so i dont really need a logical explanation. The sigil is carved into the post. The efforts of the cults was always to get Charlie/Paimon into a male host,8pg2ma
e0buccw,"You have to get away from the ""plotting and planning"" idea, like they blue printed it. The major detail regarding Charlie's accident is that the telephone pole had the cult symbol on it. That's what solidifies their hand in the whole thing.

There's a reason that the movie is called Hereditary. From the beginning, the family is doomed. Whatever the cultists have done is very much passed down throughout the family, far before the film starts. Ellen's husband starved himself and was ""schizophrenic"" and her son hung himself after he claimed that his mother was trying to ""put people inside of him."" By the time we reach Annie and her family, the forces that the cultists have worked with are already at large. There doesn't need to be an explanation to every detail. The majority of it is very much non-human, and so we should expect that their involvement will evade some traditionally human ways.",8pg2ma
e0bs8hx,It would be absurd if they did. The best guess I would have is they marked the telephone pole after the accident as a tribute type thing,8pg2ma
e0bwv85,"I don't know how they did it but the movie made a point to show them passing the telephone pole on the way to the party, and a [sigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_\(magic\)) has been carved into it.",8pg2ma

e0cq9kk,"I feel like you're reading too much/expecting too much or maybe you don't understand how magic works? This movie is about the occult, and a cult of people using satanic black magic. Magic isn't necessarily detail\-oriented. Think of a love spell. When you cast a love spell on someone, you just cast a general sense of them falling in love with you, it's not like you cast a spell that says ""At this time on this day you'll see me and then we'll make eye contact and then 2 days later you'll bump into me again and then we'll exchange phone numbers and then 3 days later you'll call me and blah blah blah."" You don't plan it all out. Like when witches cast money spells, they just put out a general sense of wanting money, and trust the universe or god or satan or whatever to provide the rest. You put out what you want and the rest falls into place, because that's what magic does.  


So in this case, the cultists wanted Charlie to die. Decapitation was part of the equation and Paimon/Charlie knew it because of the bird. Maybe the bird was even part of the spell, and Paimon was prepping Charlie's body for that. Then the cult put the thing in the road and marked the pole, believing that the sigil would draw the car towards it when it swerved. It doesn't have to be any more planned out than that. That's just how magic works. Honestly I don't understand why this is an issue?",8pg2ma

e0c3f8v,"So I believe it's intentionally ambiguous as to _exactly_ what happens, but remember how Paimon needs a healthy male host? I don't think Grandma or Annie conjured him, rather his spirit existed (embodied by the blue lightwave throughout the movie) and was waiting for the male. When Peter threw himself out the window at the end he dies and Paimon takes him over. Everything up until then wasn't Paimon, it was only conjuring spirits of the dead.",8pg2ma

e0dg6bd,"Paimon wants a male host and will only grant wishes if given one. If you listen to Charlie at the beginning, she tells Annie that grandma wanted her to be a boy (the inference here also explains why Charlie has a traditionally male name like Charles). At the first group therapy, Annie mentions her brother killed himself because he was mentally ill and her mother “kept trying to put people inside him.” She mentions her father died under brutal circumstances, too. Annie talks at length about how much she resented her mother and didn’t let her near her first born, Peter. She let her be a part of Charlie’s life, and Ellen took over as the dominant force in Charlie’s life (hence the breastfeeding figures where Ellen is preparing to nurse baby Charlie instead of Annie). Ellen tried summoning the demon with her husband and son but failed because they killed themselves. Annie didn’t let Ellen near Peter, so she summoned the demon into Charlie, and then basically plotted getting it into Peter with her coven before dying. ",8pg2ma
e0dggxq,"Joanie actually said, ""Peter, you are Paimon"" Charlie was a vessel, but in the end, Joan said Oaimon needed to embody a male.

Edit: I hought I saw Joan again at the end bowing but I wasn't sure if it was her or not. ",8pg2ma
e0f4tir,"2. I think Steve had to die because he was in the way of burning the notebook, that is severing Paimon's connection to the real world. Annie had to die because of this too, I think.

Horror fans claiming a horror movie need to be scary are missing the point and not really horror fans at all if that's what they go to see horror movies for. The genre isn't ""scary movie"" is it?

This movie was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I'd like to try to explain.  Some of the ""scary"" does include some of the basics (mom in the upper corner of the room - that's just scary, to me at least).  The main thing for me though was this growing sense that they are being watched.  Some of that has to do with their own actions - for instance Peter, early in the movie, having a sudden feeling someone is watching him while he is in his bed and looking around the room anxiously.  **If you've never experienced that half asleep, half awake feeling where you are suddenly too scared to roll over in bed because you just know you will see someone standing in the doorway looking at you (?night terror?), then count your blessings.**  I've experienced that maybe 10-12 times in my adult life and it is terrifying.  Some of the scare factor also has to do with the setting - middle of nowhere in the woods, with uncovered windows throughout much of the house.  And the camera angles always seemed to have open spaces and darkened corners in the background that lend a feeling that someone was there, watching.  And for a lot of people those things mean little to nothing; and that's fine.  But for me those things all add up to having to watch a couple of hours of comedy afterwards before I can sleep.

Then Peter goes into the treehouse and the cult is there all bowing and showing worship to him as Paimon. (I think this is what happened, but to me it looked like he was confused as fuck.)

I mean Charlie was a vessel for Paimon, it's reasonable to assume he had some direct control over her actions. This is likely why she leaned out of the window. 

I don't believe they intended for Peter to die, as the ritual required the decapitated heads of three generations of the same bloodline. 

If Peter had died then and there, I don't believe Paimon would have been able to use his body as a host. They still needed the mother to be decapitated for the ritual to succeed.

I too went into this movie without seeing the trailer or having any idea what it was about. I went  and saw it with 6 other coworkers. As we were walking out, I was expecting everyone to start talking about how it wasn’t good. Turns out I was the only who didn’t like it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t think the movie was horrible and I wanted to like it, but I felt like there were too many parts that were trying way too hard to be different. So many things felt like they were left unanswered and I’m usually all for movies leaving things open for your interpretation, but this was just too much for me. So many little things were happening with no explanation and I couldn’t wrap my head around them. The beheading, the spontaneous fire, the cult. Like I get that they were possessed or whatever, but these little random things with really no background info made the plot feel like it was jumping around. I absolutely hate when people in the theater laugh at something you know is supposed to be serious, but Even I found myself chuckling at times. Maybe I just have a demented sense of humor, but I found it hilarious when she was sawing her head off towards the end lol. 

I did love the part with the girl in the car. That completely caught me off guard. There is actually an article somewhere explaining how the director wanted to make the first 30 mins of this movie feel like any old horror movie and then BAM, hit us with that scene... I really respected that approach. I’ll try and find a link to that article. Also, as someone said above, the acting and cinematography was very very good. I was mainly impressed with Toni Collette and Alex Wolff’s performance. But really I just wasn’t scared by this movie.

And the firstborn male wasn't ""not good enough."" Annie mentions during the group therapy session that she didn't let her mother near her when Peter was born, so there was no opportunity to inhabit him as baby. But it's alluded that the grandmother breastfed Charlie, which allowed the spirit to be put into her body.

As for the uncomfortably long shots, those are also an artistic choice, and it's fine if they weren't your thing. The intention (according to interviews I've read) was to make things linger to point that the audience gets slightly uncomfortable. ",8pg2ma

It did remind me of several films after it concluded and I was looking back on it, but while watching it, I was so focused on the family aspect that I wasn’t sure if they were haunted, she was crazy, or it was a conspiracy/cult. 

I don’t know, maybe you are jaded? Maybe you caught something in the film I missed because I was paying attention to something else in the story.

But I’ve honestly, never really knocked many horror films for being predictable or tropey, because that is how most horror films are.

It’s psychologically thrilling, terrifying in that it plays to our most basic fears: losing a loved one, being responsible for that loss, losing your mind, losing control. That fear hits home with a lot of people because it’s grounded in reality, they are very real possibilities. Whereas, monsters etc are scary and good for jump scares but ultimately they don’t play into day to day life. I think the supernatural elements and the mental illness stuff were used as distractions by the director, he kept the audience guessing which one was real and which one was the red herring. There was a lot of misdirection, things built slowly...it’s a movie that requires the focus and emotional engagement of a family drama. Well acted high concept, nuanced emotional cues. Not every horror fan’s cup of tea. I thought the ending tried to pander to mainstream audiences, instead of staying true to the mindfuck it started out as.

e0ddjau,"I don’t know, that feels pretty reductive. They’re pretty similar in plotting but they still *feel* like pretty different movies because they’re so different in theme (and also pacing and everything)

The Witch was more political, directly covering ideas of religion and gender. This focused more on the family dynamics and the idea of inheriting and passing on awfulness. Because of the setting/politics of The Witch, most of the family feel awful, like villains tormenting the daughter. In this, the family are all good people who you care about and root for, even though they’re often at odds with each other.

Yes two relatives die in both films, but Hereditary is much more interested in the void left behind by them. The daughter dies so quickly, but it still feels fitting that she has as much space on the marketing as the mom does. The son in The Witch also dies *much* later.

The thing with the baby in The Witch is also not something that casts too much of a shadow over that movie, while the grandmother in this is hugely important. Constantly talking about what it was like to live with her, looking at her photos. She is the reason the cult is involved and kicks off everything.

I don’t think it’s fair to call it an “exact same copy movie,” or say it’s like The Force Awakens.",8pg2ma
e0dknug,"I agree with /u/PeteOverdrive, but I also wanted to clarify that both ""The VVitch"" and ""Hereditary"" are *distributed* by A24, but A24 wasn't involved in the production of either movie. It simply acquired them after the fact.",8pg2ma
e0d6zws,how?,8pg2ma
e0jzf4w,"I'm not going to say your dumb (or downvote you for expressing your opinion) but I do think you missed things. You say the plot makes absolutely no sense, but that's just not true. I also don't feel like it's slow to develop, as it's developing the plot the entire time, building up to the end. There are so many little clues scattered throughout nearly every scene that lead to the ending.

For example, when Annie goes to the support group she talks about her mother, and she talks about how her brother killed himself and accused his mom of ""trying to put people inside of him."" There's also a shot of an underlined section in a book Annie's mother has that says Paimon is male and thus prefers a male host. Annie's mother had been trying to invoke Paimon for years and years by the time the movie begins. 

There's also a shot at the funeral of Annie's mother where a creepy looking blonde man smiles at Charlie. Pay attention to his expression, it's a very knowing smile, as if he's anticipating what's to come, like he knows something the audience doesn't. This is the same man who appears at the end of the film after Peter goes downstairs and discovers his father's burned corpse. He turns around and sees this same man, now standing in the doorway naked, with the same smile. 

Another thing, there's a quick shot of the pamphlet advertising the séance being slipped through a mail slot a couple of scenes before Annie and Joan do the séance to summon Joan's grandson, which itself sets up the séance that Annie performs to summon Charlie.

Everything that happens in this movie happens for a reason, and as far as I could tell, everything is hinted at before it happens. We see Annie look at books on spiritualism and the occult that her mother owned VERY early in the film. We have Charlie mentioning that grandma always wanted her to be a boy. We have the phone call after the funeral stating that the grandma's grave has been desecrated. There's that scene where Peter is sitting alone at a table at school and Joan is across the street, yelling incantations. She even says something like ""Peter, GET OUT!"" because she's clearing the way for Paimon to take over.

There is nothing random in this movie, everything happens for a reason and it's very meticulous with it's details. Also, you mention the comical things at the end. This is also intentional. We see earlier in the film, in one of the grandma's books, that Paimon is the ""god of mischief."" The entire third act is basically Paimon tormenting this family for his own amusement. This is why he hangs in the corners of the ceiling, why he does that goofy swim/crawl through the air after possessing Annie, why the book burns Steven instead of Annie, why he decapitates Annie while floating in the air and staring down at Peter, why he has the naked people standing around with the creepy grins, why Peter sees Charlie in his room and then her head falls off and turns into the ball. I even think the séance scene with Charlie is actually Paimon, imitating Charlie just to scare the shit out of the family. Paimon is just having fun, he's a mischievous spirit, it's what he does.

I can understand if you didn't find the film scary or even just didn't enjoy it. But I think it's unfair to say that Ari Aster is a shitty screenwriter when it's very clear just how much attention was paid to every single detail in this film. It's not a film for everyone, but I think it definitely is a masterpiece.

One last question, if you didn't find Hereditary scary, what movies do you consider scary? I legitimately think this is the scariest film I've ever seen.

e0e2dj9,"I cared because the film up until that crescendo was rich with character development; exploring grief, mourning, and family difficulties with nuanced and realistic dialogue and acting.

The end of the film, in the literal interpretation, squashes that ambiguity once and for all in a truly shocking way for the audience. The grisly slaughter of characters we have come to related to and sympathize with feel like verses from Dante’s inferno. It was horrifying and amazing. That’s why I cared at least.

Also even if you felt Charlie was a cliché (which I didn’t but I see your point), did you not think that what ultimately happened to her and at what point in the movie it did was truly unexpected and original?

Collette was the real standout of this film. Her acting was raw, emotional, and visceral. She really opened the story, giving the audiences a tether and point of view into the world of the broken family.  
The actor playing Peter also did very well. Playing sheer terror is much harder than it seems, and so is playing shock. I was almost moved to tears by his reaction to Charlie’s tragic death.  
Speaking of Charlie, she’s possibly one of the best child actresses I’ve ever seen. She gave an eerie and emotional performance as a strange, misunderstood little girl. Her panic during the car scene was palpable.  
Finally, even the father (who had a somewhat thankless role as the skeptic) did a good job. His reactions to his unspooling family felt authentic. I pitied him a lot.  
So guess what? Some of us DO know our shit, and a lot of ua don’t appreciate being insulted by a dick who probably thought that “The Bye-Bye Man” was better than “The Shining” because it had “fewer slow scenes!!!”

All of this is explained and implied throughout the film.

Peter’s loss on bodily control, such as the throat closing up and the face smashing the desk, is the demonic influence (Paimon) trying to weaken and/or ultimately control him. This is essential to the plot, because Paimon ultimately takes over Peter (the ending).

Peter’s throat closing up could be a manifestation of his own mental breakdown/guilt/anxiety/psychosis or you could also conclude it was the cult or Paimon haunting him.

e0gsw1k,"I guess this is where everyone who doesn't want to do a little leg work will ding this film. If you're not going to want to do that or REALLY pay attention to not just the screen but everything that's going on around the characters then you'll miss a lot. 

I looked up Paimon when I got home and read up on this demon. Just about everything that was going with these characters within the film you could say was it's fault (""knowledge of past and future events, clearing up doubts, making spirits appear, creating visions, acquiring and dismissing servant spirits, reanimating the dead for several years, flight, remaining underwater indefinitely, and general abilities to 'make all kinds of things' (and) 'all sorts of people and armor appear.'""). Besides the whole family getting setup for getting the shaft here, I think Paimon orchestrated everything once it was brought into the human plane by the grandma. The triangle in her bedroom was probably where it was summoned and why it was in their house. 

Since Paimon can make you see visions, that would explain all the crazy shit the mother saw in her dreams. Slowly driving her crazy and blurring the lines on what's real and whats not. That psycho bitch Joan having Annie do a ritual to communicate with ""Charlie"" was pretty demonic. Since Joan knew the fragile state Annie was in, this was pretty easy to do. 
And then later when the mother kills her husband, why is she floating/crawling around the house? Could that have been a vision (or sleep walking) as well? Her death was probably the most craziest thing I've seen in awhile as she was staring directly into the camera just burning a hole into you. The slow burn up to the last 15-20 mins is there to wear you down. 

Also little things within the film that I noticed was the floor mats. The one for Peter had an unfinished pentagram (iirc). While all the women had nice one's with flowers..etc. There's a lot to go through that this film should get many views to understand the whole thing. It's interesting with the comparison to Exorcist that I think a lot of people where thinking they were going to get a standard possession flick.

It wasn't meant to be a twist.  Neither was the pot.  It was hardly a plot device; the kid was doing it to hang out with a hot girl in the first place.  That was the main plot device, and the weed was just a facet of it.  In my talks with my friends, we all knew that her allergy would pop up and that as soon as he left her, some shit would go down.  It was no surprise that it did, and those previously established devices, like Peters crush and Charlie's allergy, weren't out of the blue.  Both of those parts had been established within the first five scenes.  It wasn't cheap by any means if it was part of the movie from the get go.  The director likely did it like that to put the viewer into a false sense of security of being able to predict the plot, before taking the fucking kids head off.  That was a fucked up moment that caught everyone in the theater off guard and at least for my group, it was because we had assumed Charlie was gonna die in some cliche way, like choking, or dying from shock.  It lulled us into that sense of security and then promptly slapped us on the ass and said ""here's a head, and here's how Peter will respond.  He'll drive home, and go to bed without looking at the body.  He'll live in this state of shock for half of the movie.""  I've never seen a death scene pulled off like that, where the person responsible straight up ignores that he did it for a good chunk of the film.  The ten minutes following the death were some of the heaviest I've ever watched in film.  It was anything but cliche after her death, and the shock factor of it was aided by the cliche of how it came to be. Sure, the set up was cliche.  That's how it works with a lot of films.

The horror of losing a child is absolutely gut wrenching and because of the incredible cast you could really see the pain that everybody was dealing with.

To add further, many many families do not communicate or even really know one another. It’s depressing to think about but it’s fairly common. 

I’m curious as to what information you were talking about that no one used. I can’t recall a scene in the film in which someone blatantly ignored information told to them. However, I’ve only seen the film once so far so I could have missed something as well (how ironic!) 

As for foreshadowing in a horror movie that is highly common. I believe the whole point of that tactic is that upon rewatching you realize how information was already present prior to any incident therefore creating an eerie concept of “nothing can be avoided because it is fate.” Also, when the subject matter is cult related/demonic it’s impossible to avoid. In fact it’s necessary because with zero context it has no baseline.

No, I take that back.  I was scared shitless.  A few times I had to do that little trick of fast forwarding until you see the scare, then rewind and watch at normal speed.  And I'm 51.  Didn't know a movie could still scare me that much.",8pg2ma

But in retrospect, that’s a bit obscure, and I don’t think they wanted her spirit to pass successfully anyway, given the later recovery of the body and its use in ritual.

How much did she know?

There was a point while I was watching the movie where I was pretty sure it was going to be revealed that Annie was basically in on everything. That she had some degree of reservations about killing her family, but she'd been raised in her mother's religion and believed that was what had to be done. The letter at the beginning from the mother made me think that. Also the way she approached her husband while trying to get him to throw the book in the fire - it seemed like she loved him but she was trying to trick him into doing something that she knew would kill him. At least, that was how it seemed to me in that moment. By the end of the film, I wasn't sold on that theory anymore.

As for the hand, Paimon - or some malevolent force associated with the cult - is repeatedly attempting to wrestle control of Peter from his own body. Breaking him mentally is clearly the key to that.

I actually don't think either party deserves blame for it though. My view is that because of the whole ritual thing set up by the grandmother/the cultists, it was almost like that tragic death was destined to happen (as evident by the cultish marking on the telephone pole).

The whole party scene I could convince myself it was my sister on screen.

e0ciimp,Decapitation was the only way for Paimon to move from host to host. But he could only actualize in a male as we saw when Annie was rifling thru her mothers old books. So when charlie said that grandmother wished she was a boy was actually because Paimon only actualizes his full form in a male host. So Gma felt that having charlie have a male name and tom\-boy\-ish was good enough for Paimon to actualize in her but it was not. That was why she had the crazy allergic reaction that made her look the way she did. The gma was having her drink that tea with the herbs in it that Annie ended up drinking when she went to Joans apartment. Annie also then read a lot the passage which was actually a pasage to allow Paimon to come into you. So the decapitation of Charlie was supernaturally orchestrated (as we saw the symbol on the electrical pole right after she was killed) so Paimon could leave Charlies body. Paimon then moved onto Annie. From here Paimon is working to break down Peter as he is the desired male host. So then the scene where Annie is floating and cutting her head off is Paimon releasing himself from Annie so he can take over Peter in his very weakened state and then fully actualize (the scene in the tree house where he is crowned). I do not exactly know why the father burst into flames I imagine this was because he didn't really believe Annie was telling the truth and was too strong of a host so Paimon chose to get rid of him. Also the scene where Joan was screaming at Peter from across the street was her banishing his soul from his body to make room for Paimon to enter. ,8pg2ma
e0er1fs,"The movie was showing the end-game of transferring king paimon into a suitable, male vessel.  Annie’s brother, who killed himself, was the first known attempted vessel.  Annie said in her grief group that he was complaining that their mother tried to “put people in him.“

The demon of king paimon is transferred every time a head gets cut off. This is alluded to in the film with the book of spirits showing him on top of a mound of severed heads.  The movie shows, quite logically, four transfers. Similar to Denzel Washington movie “Fallen”... showing a demon that transfers himself by touch, if I recall.

First, we learn Grandma’s grave has been desecrated (and her head likely removed). This transfers the demon from grandma to the bird we see later in the photo/invoice emailed to husband showing the grave . 

Second, the bird flies into the window at Charlie’ school and she cuts off its head. This is the demon transferring himself from the bird to Charlie.

Third, Charlie is beheaded (after eating chocolate cake that the demon “arranged” to be cut with the same knife used with the nuts...to which Charlie is very allergic).  This and the subsequent seance transfers the demon from Charlie to mom. 

Last, mom cuts off her own head at the behest of the demon. This frees him to move into her son, Peter. The final vessel.

e0b48kw,"part of the ritual involves decapitation, you can see a picture as the mother flips through the books",8pg2ma

e0dd8af,"Well, keep in mind, it's possible that Peter and the mother are schizophrenic, like the grandmother, and everything is happening in their heads. There's a *lot* of ways the movie dances around answering this.  
             
So, because Charlie's death triggers the schizophrenia in both of them, their visual hallucinations constantly evoke the thing that triggered them. ",8pg2ma
e0dbqfm,"I think that Paimon enters and exits the bodies through the head. Explains why the grandmas corpse was decapitated, why Charlie was decapitated, and why Annie cut her head off with the piano string. Kinda also explains why the husbands charred body was headless, since he was probably possessed by Paimon to an extent, which is why he burned when the book burned. ",8pg2ma
e0ia3m4,"**Are the decapitations part of Paimon-related lore?**

Not really. Aster added that element himself, and he’s not into explaining why. As he told Vulture, “I think it would be disingenuous for me to give any sort of intellectual answer. I feel like there are a lot of really good reasons and I like all of them, but uttering them kind of robs them of something. But I do like all the things that they might provoke in somebody.” As for Collette, she has formed her own theory about all the rolling heads. “We’re so attached to our bodies, we’re so attached to the brain and the mind. They’re like the control center, and that once you lose that metaphorically, you become nothing, and therefore you are able to give yourself over to this greater force?” Speculate away!

e0eh62p,"Here is a theory I was discussing with some friends after we saw it last night. When Paimon chooses a host, he cannot jump to another host until the head of the previous host has been cut off.

A lot of these points don't make sense until the end of the movie:

-After the grandmothers funeral the family receives a call saying that the grave had been desecrated, at this point the grandmothers body had been remove, her head had been cut off (WE DON'T SEE THIS) and her body placed in the Attic.

-Once the grandmothers head was cut off Charlie was the next host, but Paimon was not happy with being in a body who had such  vulnerabilities, so the Cult of Paimon had Charlie eat cake at the party with nuts in it (I believe one of the girls making the cake can be seen in the last scene as part of the cult). They had not planned on Charlie's head being decapitated by the pole, but the pole DID have a symbol of their cult on it so they probably planned some kind of accident so Peter would not be able to get home on time and give her the epi pen. The cult probably had planned to dig up Charlie after her funeral, same as the grandmother, and cut her head off then to release Paimon. However, the pole decapitating Charlie worked just as well.

-When the mother is possessed, you can hear the Piano crash or break and she cuts her head off with the piano wire.  Once her body falls Paimon leaves that host and enters Peter a young male host.

I'm sure there are a lot of theories floating around but this one seemed to really fit.

I just felt silly and frustrated when everyone laughed at the end.

e0fjxiy,"You're right about the mental illnesses she mentions at the group therapy \- it was DID, depressive psychosis, and schizophrenia. I liked how pretty much all of the symptoms of possession shown in the film could also very plausibly be symptoms of schizophrenia or other mental illness: seeing lights, hearing voices (Charlie's clucking, and when Joanie calls Peter's name at the end), sensations of being watched or followed, belief in taking part part of some grand plot. At the very end it seems like Peter believing, or being told, that he's a king of hell is a typical delusional belief. Substitute Jesus for Paimon and it's not that unbelievable.

All of the traumatic events leading up to the third act could very well trigger psychotic episodes in someone predisposed to having serious mental illness. My takeaway was the whole movie, ending and all, works if you read it as being primarily about mental illness.",8pg2ma

We saw it and he was giving me shit for being on edge. He was just like ""it's just a movie, blahblahblah"". I know it's just a movie. It's a damned good movie.

e0d811q,"Here's my thing.  


With a name like ""Hereditary"" and the trailers and all the mentions of schizophrenia in the family, I thought it was going to be another babadook where it was actually a family drama about the horrors of mental illness and how it tore them apart. Even with all the supernatural elements early on I was still expecting it to be a ""she was just mentally ill"" situation.   


Which made the ending completely blindside me with the insanity. Being an A24 film, I kept on trying to reason out how it was related to mental illness and a family drama as the plot went along that I never paid attention to the signs or expected the reveal that it was all planned cult madness (Joane's apartment interior and the seance scenes kind of tip you off though).  


So in that way, I liked that the movie was unpredictable and kept you guessing.

The film was incredible, cinematography wise, with but the slightest of dialogue issues (I personally wasn't a fan of some of the more heavy handed early foreshadowing), and rather spot on juxtaposing/eerie music, that I really did not need to see the mother attach herself to a ceiling whacking her head against it in an almost slapstick fashion, or a load of naked people doing freaky things, or the flying decapitation. Leave in the child's decapitated head, leave in the bugs and the flies, hell, the father could still burst into flames somehow.

I was more scared at the mother explaining to her son that he wasn't wanted that I was at he being attached to the ceiling like a Scooby Doo villain. ",8pg2ma

Lets just say hypothetically that this type of occult ritual has some level of power. And that the ritual on screen was identical to the real thing. (minus the bodies being fake, obviously) Well, we all just sat through it and witnessed it. What does that mean/do? Who knows.

After she dies, her spirit appears vengeful because it’s mentioned that Paimon is in a bad mood whenever he’s offered a female host. This is also why grandma wishes Charlie was a boy. The strongest evidence is the clicking noise, which possessed Peter also makes. It stands to reason as well that the photograph of the grandmother being showered with gold was her reward for integrating Paimon into Charlie’s body.

We know that Peter is only reliving a memory and that the mirror isn’t actually there, but we see it anyway. After that point I just couldn’t trust anything being shown as objective reality, because like the mirror, it could very well be a product of the his mind.

e83zjwi,"Nahhhh mate, It Follows was about the concept of death. I'll write a lengthy explanation of my interpretation if anybody wants. I just think that the STD explanation is selling the allegory of that movie a little short.

[EDIT]: Sorry I was very busy for a while there, but here we go (**spoilers if you haven't seen It Follows**):

Most people suppose that It Follows is strictly an allegory about the danger of STD's because the monster is passed on by having sex with somebody else. While I think that is part of it, I don't think it captures the full story of what the creators were trying to convey. I've watched the movie a few times and picked up on a few things that I think indicate that the allegory isn't just about sexual health, but about the fear that comes with growing out of childhood, becoming an adult, and realizing that death is a very real thing that will eventually reach everybody, including you.

Hell, it's been a while since I've seen the movie, I'd have to watch it again and take notes to get the finer points, but the gist of the matter is that the monster is, metaphorically, ""real life"" that you have to face when you grow up.  The reason sex is so prominent in this process is because it's a simple way of encapsulating this turning point for these teenagers who are just turning 16-17 or so - you've lost your virginity and are finally a ""grown up."" The final shot of the movie, which shows Jay and Paul happily walking down the street holding hands while a teenager figure slowly walks behind them, indicates that they've accepted their eventual fate, come to terms with it, and don't actively fear it anymore... but regardless it still slowly follows you to your grave, literally.

Her daughter was pretty much her mother’s child—she gave her to her mother once Charlie was born, since she denied her mother, Peter.

e76f878,">  I don't understand the full connection between them

I agree; this comes down to my central problem of the movie which was that the demon’s rules were not properly explained. I agree that Charlie = Paimon (we’re certainly given enough context in the last scene to justify this). However, despite needing a male host, he never actively pursued it unless we are to **assume** (we shouldn’t have to) that Charlie ate the cake knowing it would kill her. 

> assumingly by the cultists/coven

Yeah, that’s the problem. Then the husband asks the wife if she did it while she was sleep walking. All we are given is conjecture. 

> the decapitation is required for the ritual as shown in the final scene where they are seen bowing to Paimon's idol.

But...why? Because Paimon is traditionally drawn as carrying a bunch of heads with him? That’s pretty weak, but it’s the only *direct* explanation provided. I do very much like the idea that the decapitation ties into the theme of mental illness, literally “losing your mind.” And while I generally think the mental illness/hereditary possession parallel is made pretty elegantly, it’s a problem that the literal reason for decapitation is never explained. A metaphor is only strong to me if it makes sense literally...it’s why I really didn’t like “mother!”

> the grandmother essentially groomed the family to be the sacrifices necessary to reincarnate him.

But why? Literally everyone she is related to dies before she completes the ritual. Did she get rich before her death? We’re shown that one photo of her being showered with gold coins, but she never expresses her wealth or regret at possibly being cheated.

The bird was purely symbolic, that the decapitation of carrier/host was necessary for transfer of spirit, BUT only if host target is vunerable enough. That figurine Charlie was making was a replica of the mannequin at end movie, the positioning of the arms were identical. It signified that Charlie was aware of the end goal from the get go, that the decapitated head must be used for the crowning cemeony of Painmon to ultimate host, Peter. Peter was not posessed after the car accident, because he wasn't weak enough yet, but note that when smoking with friends under the rafters soon after the incident, he suffers pain, this was the first attempt at Paimon attempting to break in. Second attempt was in the class, when he escaped by hitting his head against the table, then finally in the attic/lawn. I have to disagree with your theory on Annie becoming posessed after the seance in their home. I believe what she channeled was actually the pure spirit of Charlie, unpossessed as Paimon was no longer using Charlie as a host. Note how Charlie sounds completely different and also like a normal scared girl. Annie only became host AFTER she witnessed the headless body of her mother in the attic, which her husband also saw. Due to this, only moments after, they are both reduced to a vunerbale enough state that she becomes host, and he is burned to death. I'll leave you with this. When Annie sees Charlies headless body in the car, we see Annie crying but in the same exact pose as the headless worshippers at the end.

I thought Charlie basically became Paimon right around the time of Ellen’s death. Like, that vessel was dying and Charlie was the replacement. But Ellen had spent Charlie's entire life grooming her to be the vessel that would allow her to get into Peter’s body eventually. 

There was that diorama of Ellen with her tit out (or was it the other way around?) trying to breastfeed Peter, and then the whole conversation about how Annie never let grandma have anything to do with Peter, but she let her take care of Charlie out of a sense of guilt. So it had to be Charlie, even though boys are much more desirable as vessels. ",8pg2ma

e1hjaee,"I mean, that all makes sense to me for a few reasons:

* Paimon gains power from beheadings. He had limited power when he possessed Peter. By the point that Annie is crawling across the ceiling the have the heads of Charlie, Ellen, and now Annie's Husband. 
* There was an ongoing theme of freezing and cold in the movie. At the start, Paimon/Charlie sleeps in the treehouse and despite being freezing doesn't seem bothered. Annie's husband keeps going after everyone to tell them to stay warm, he's concerned for them. I feel like the idea is Paimon and his cultists are kept warm by the flames of hell.
* Annie floating while sawing her own head off made sense to me in the context of Paimon's strength grown to that point. I also feel like it has a specific purpose, they needed peter to be vulnerable and they had to break him down mentally. They had him behead his sister, they killed his family, they had his mother chase him into the attic and had her saw her own head off. they needed him to lose what was left of his sanity so Paimon could take over. the more ridiculous, the better.",8pg2ma
e1geu4g,"I completely disagree. I think part of the confusion must come from reduced familiarity with cult lore. Have you seen many movies in this genre? It builds on a lot of ideas and lore from other movies. The brief explanation is that Annie didn't become a cultist, Paimon possessed her.

Charlie was never Charlie, she was always just Paimon. She did not have a developmental disorder, she was just a demon. Paimon's intended vessel was Peter all along but because Annie and Ellen weren't speaking, she missed the opportunity to insert him into his body via breastfeeding like she did with Charlie. She also tried that on her own son as a teenager but the son resisted and killed himself, they blamed it on schizophrenia. Ellen herself was said to have DID but she was really possessed by Paimon and he could sometimes control her. Paimon prefers male bodies, female bodies are more difficult to control. Ellen channeled Paimon into Charlie and the plan was to break Peter down to make it easier to channel Paimon into Peter. They had to have Peter kill Charlie to break him down. Then, they had to break Annie by having her perform the seance to channel Paimon's spirit back into the book. When Annie burned the book and her husband caught on fire she was completely broken and Paimon was able to enter her. Then he attacked Peter until he threw himself from the window, either killing or knocking him unconscious, Paimon killed Annie by cutting her head off and then entered Peter.

Hope that helps",8pg2ma

After all, it is called Hereditary, which implies it could be a mental disorder or a tainted bloodline. The only thing that really solidified it as supernatural for me was Charlie's seance. The husband saw the glass move across the table and he also reacted to the glass object shattering off screen. His would be the only perspective that the audience can trust. Also, the scene where the dog was barking in Peter's doorway when Charlie's head rolled off in the corner. That seemed supernatural, too.",8pg2ma

e4ud1zt,"Exactly. Very good points. There are a lot of holes in the theory.

I think it was an attempt but mabe Peter was too strong and only when his mum turned it fully broke him down to the point where he was vulnerable enough to be possessed, hence the window jump. It's kinda far fetched though so I do fully understand your point.

As for the Charlie decap, I think the mother breaking down at the sight of the body was enough to start the mental breakdown process. It really does seem to emphasise the pain and agony of the mother losing her child. I believe her nightmares of nearly killing Peter following the angry dinner scene show her dive in mental wellbeing making it easier for the demon to get to her. The father dying was all she needed to be pushed over the edge.

Funny thing I've just noticed ALL the characters that get possessed lose someone they rely on. For example Charlie relied on her grandmother, the mother relied on her husband (to keep her mentally in check), and Peter relied on them both.

I think that it would have been a stellar ending to leave out the three posessed annie scenes that clearly illustrate supernatural elements, and the third person perspective of the light - doing so would have allowed us to see the movie from the perspectives of Annie and Peter as unreliable narrators suffering from debilitating mental illness.

Even when I “see” something, I can move about the bed, reach my hand out, pull the covers up and hide, etc. I’m not frozen, as sleep paralysis always seems to point to.

Night Terror Symptoms
Sudden awakening from sleep, persistent fear or terror that occurs at night, screaming, sweating, confusion, rapid heart rate, inability to explain what happened, usually no recall of ""bad dreams"" or nightmares, may have a vague sense of frightening images. Many people see spiders, snakes, animals or people in the room, are unable to fully awake, difficult to comfort, with no memory of the event on awakening the next day.

Sleep Paralysis Symptoms
Sleep paralysis is when, during awakening or falling asleep, a person is aware but unable to move or speak.[1][2] During an episode, one may hear, feel, or see things that are not there.[1] It often results in fear.[1] Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes.[2] It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.[1]",8pg2ma

e4qdfid,"Unfortunately the other replies are wrong. I went through a bit of a phase where I was absolutely obsessed with the occult (not that I really believe any of it, I just found it fascinating) so I might be able to shed a light. I'm on mobile though so I'll have to do it off the top of my head. Sorry if I mess some stuff up.

First off, 'Satanists' isn't specific enough, that's more of a catch-all term used by outsiders. So first the important question is, what kind of cult are we dealing with?

The cult in this movie are trying to summon Paimon. Paimon is the 8th king of hell mentioned in a precursor to the book ""The lesser key of solomon"" called something like ""Pseudodemon Monarchy"" but in latin. His powers are described as summoning and dismissing spirits, knowledge of past and future, providing visions... You know, the works. Pretty much all the things that happen in this movie.

Anyway, the important thing is what this says about the cult. They aren't just a cult, they are a coven of witches that practice Solomonic Magick. So if you want to know what a triangle represents, you have to look in that direction. Off the top of my head, triangles are used for two things in magick; to focus energy and to summon (obviously you'd need to channel energy to a specific point for summoning too). Basically a triangle is like a big fat arrow pointing at whatever is at it's center as far as the spiritual realm is concerned (according to Solomonic Magick).

This makes sense as we get a glimpse of Joan's room when the mother (her name escapes me at the moment) can't get in. At the center of everything, at the center of the table... is a picture of Peter in a triangle. This is because they are trying to channel Paimon _into_ him.

Hope that helps.",8pg2ma

Paimon rejected Charlie and that was why the coven arranged for her death.",8pg2ma

e0i9vvh,"The biggest difference in the Sundance cut was that it wasn’t even the completed version of the film. It still had some visual effects that hadn’t been completed. 

Regarding the test screening, the main difference was the eye gouging ending. I can’t really recall if there was much else in it that wasn’t in the recently released theatrical version. 

I know that the movie was originally going to be over 3 hours long but I never saw that version and I’m not sure if it even screened for a test audience. If it did I wasn’t one of them. That being said I know from reading the script that a lot of the content that wasn’t in the theatrical cut was mainly family drama stuff and not supernatural stuff.",8pg2ma

e0lrmoe,Basically the last VM you want to hear at the funeral of your sister...and maybe another thing for Peter to hate on his mother for.  I understand why they cut this out...but it completely fits with the whole uncomfotable vibe going on in this movie.  Cant wait to see all the deleted scenes...apparently over an hour of cuts made (as well as an alternative ending),8pg2ma
e0m4klg,"Very interesting, thanks! Could you link me to wherever you found the screenplay? I'd love to read it, too.

That also makes sense with the ""Oh good, they're home"" that we hear from the parents' room as Peter is walking past it that night.",8pg2ma
e0loo01,...that ends up making the film far less interesting.,8pg2ma
e0v01qy,"I think they took scenes out, and changed scenes after test screenings, because the original ending had peter stab his own eyes out, which was foreshadowed in the drawings, but that ending tested horribly, so they changed it. I'd imagine that a graphic dog death might've upset audience members? The dad even makes a comment in the beginning on how ""good"" the dog was, so there was definitely something that was cut.",8pg2ma
e0ywgns,"I think we did get something though. We see Peter in shock and for the next segment of the film he’s afraid to enter the house and interact with his parents at all. He even stands in the hallway motionless while the mother sobs over it. THAT’s the immediate aftermath. He can’t face his parents because he’s so stricken with guilt. From the scene a little later on when Annie is making the miniature model of the accident, I can only assume she knows what happened because Peter told them. Obviously they would have had questions when Annie found the body, but I don’t think we really needed to see the confrontation scene. We got the impact from the scenes they did show, and I think it was really well done",8pg2ma
e0zl5lv,Such a good point. I do not find Annie to be a good mother in any aspect really. She lacks empathy and patience nor does she take any responsibility of the torture her family is going through until it is much too late. Why would she have her mother in her house in the first place? They were estranged for a reason. She thought it would be alright to have her mother with DID and dementia around her young children? After she didn't want the first one?  Oh and the miniature of Charlie's accident! Seems like having children you don't really want is hereditary too.,8pg2ma
e0xy74q,"If I'm reading your comment correctly, you may have missed that Annie explicitly says Peter never apologized during her shout-fest at dinner. You're definitely correct that it's an impossible thing to apologize for. I guess I just can't relate, seems like an all-out sobbing breakdown in front of the family would be inevitable. Others have pointed out Peter's fear of his mother following the sleepwalking incident, and I think that's a pretty fair explanation for Peter being incapable of communicating such a basic thing to his family. ",8pg2ma
e107r92,"For me I felt it was something different. Paimon possessed the vulnerable and seems to have moved about a fair bit. The scene in the school where Peter gives the desk a Glasgow kiss made me think he was already possessed. It feels like Paimon has been hopping about between the 3 as they become vulnerable. When the dad stops at the red light and breaks down I think Paimon moves to him then as the most vulnerable. In fact I start to believe that the dad may have been the target in the first place otherwise why move from Peter? So my thinking is the sketch book is linked to the summoning and when Annie tries to burn it she is possessed so catches fire. The dad resists because he is possessed. She grabs it from him and he goes up in flames. She's terrified. Distraught. Vulnerable. And that moment in there where she suddenly goes blank is Paimon taking her to survive. The attic stuff is all to force Peter into a vulnerable state.

For the record I would have preferred the film to end when they stuck the crown on his head and avoided using the cult to explain what had happened. ",8pg2ma

I just found weird that Ellen Leigh was called Queen Leigh. Was she supposed to be Paimon before he was reborn as her granddaughter? If so, why was Ellen still alive after Charlie`s birth? 
Maybe once Paimon reincarnated as Ellen Leigh`s granddaughter , the onset of dementia started? implying that her soul (paimon) left her body. 
Also, Anie`s  brother and father died too, maybe they were Paimonm hence the tittle hereditary.

e0bqb0r,She ate nuts at the party. One of the first scenes of the party was this girl (maniacally) and chopping walnuts. I'm guessing they put walnuts in the chocolate cake.

e0gvfi5,"Yes, you're right. I only considered that maybe Paimon was hoping that Charlie would be beheaded after death like Ellen was.   


But I don't think Charlie was having a reaction under the bleachers, though. He was getting high and had a bad trip. It seemed like he was recalling Charlie's last words and it drove him to a dark place. All he needed was some comfort which is why he asked for his friend to hold his hand. ",8pg2ma

e4xcv4a,"But he was never a key part of the ritual/sacrifice. I interpreted his death as collateral damage- he simply had to die in order for the events to unfold uninterrupted, and died differently than his wife and children. I'm sensing decapitation is a theme for Paimon and his manifestation, so in that vein the dad was not a part of the sacrifice. It was the unholy trinity of the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter- all of whom were beheaded, and their bodies placed in positions of worship (Charlie's head was on the altar, rather) in the treehouse.",8pg2ma

When the movie turns out to be a slow burn, many get bored and start to laugh at the movie so they can have fun mocking something they don’t like. Sure, a lot of people react to horror with nervous laughter, but you can tell the difference between a nervous laugh and a condescending one. Many are unfortunately experiencing the latter in theaters.",8pg2ma
e0dflvb,"I laugh at stuff like this because I'm having a blast. I thought it was FANTASTIC. My gf was next to me nearly in tears because she was terrified and I just wanted to applaud all of the spine tingling shit. It's more of a, ""wow... well done"" laugh than anything. I certainly wouldn't take the laughter as anything more than someone enjoying themselves... horror movies are supposed to be fun afterall.

 I'm planning on seeing it again on a weekday matinee with the hopes of fewer people. I feel guilty, too, because I'm afraid I'll seem like a jerk by getting upset, because I dont want it to seem like it's wrong if someone finds something funny and I don't.

e0hxjk3,"Yep this was a weird one too. I couldn't quite figure out if it was supposed to symbolize something.

What was supposed to be her sacrifice turns into the absolute worst case scenario she could ever imagine in that instance.

e0r7lut,"That's exactly the sort of theoretical reading I'm trying to get away from. For me, that nullifies everything interesting about the film - if it's true (and clearly there's nothing about the film that says it has to be true - it's basically an unfalsifiable theory), then nothing of substance actually occurred and we're just grappling with illusions. No actual relationships between characters (since there's just ONE character in ""reality"" on your view), no conspiracy, no deceit, no curses, etc. All the content of the film is wholly illusory and therefore expendable. It's far too literal (""all that's REALLY going on is a psychotic person muttering away in a cell"") and takes away all the magic. On my view, we DO get the neutral view, but all this means is that the events occur exactly as they are presented, not as illusions. There's clearly an ambiguity in whether or not ""hereditary"" refers to psychological or supernatural forces - so we can question what's really going on- but on your reading, that isn't important because everything is subsumed to the psychological life of a single individual. I'd be okay with saying certain PARTS of the film are illusory (maybe Annie hallucinated her husband burning and she's the one who set him ablaze, for instance), but the ""it was all a DID dream"" thing irks me.

Also the girl at the party and his class I think may be in the cult and possibly one of the cultists in the treehouse at the end. The younger cultist kneeling in the middle.

Late night weekend crowds tend to have your fair share of young tipsied twenty somethings guffawing at every inappropriate moment to show off how badass and funny they are. Had a guy like that in *Split* and when a couple people tried to shush him, he got agitated and said ""fuck you"" back, but then his friends reined him in I assume because they didn't want to get kicked out.

I also enjoy me some good popcorn horror like The Conjuring and stuff like that, but I think opening weekend audiences typically don't know what they're getting when they chase the latest horror movie. They just want to go to the latest horror movie to have a scream with their friends and will go to whatever movie might fulfill that. Then they get mad and impatient when they realize that's not exactly what they're getting.

I think why my audience generally stayed engaged was because they were getting pretty much exactly what the trailer was selling, a psychological thriller with a hint of the occult. As opposed to A24's last horror submission *It Comes At Night* which was sold almost as a monster flick.",8pg2ma

e2h6l4n,"Hey thank you for the comment.  I thought the car accident scene was the worst out of everything else in the movie, it was also the one I said I could relate to.  The whole vibe and how Peter reacted to what happened made it alot worse too.  I do have to say it was some of the best acting I've seen in quite a long time though.",8pg2ma
e4on09i,"Late to the party, but I had to stop here while reading through this entire thread.

This movie had three 'worst' scenes for me. 
 The first one is when Annie sees/imagines/hallucinates her late mother in the workshop. The way the scene is presented really felt like it was a ""corner of the eye""-sighting (she's in the corner rather than the ""center of attention"") that you usually just brush off as nothing. Also the fact that's it's dimly lit but we're still able to see her clearly. 
This one took me off-guard and it really set the uneasy-mood for me for the remainder of the film.

Second worst is Annie decapitating herself. At first it didn't get me, I thought she was hanging from something, like a noose, and that in itself was not enough to get to me. It's quickly revealed that she's levitating and cutting her head off with a piano wire. Again, for me, that concept isn't something that creeps my out usually... But the execution of it in this particular film... Starting out slowly, with almost mechanically straight movements and then going faster and faster along with the sounds and her constant glare scared the shit out of me. Holy shit, it was immensely unnerving.

But the real winner for me... Is then Annie chased Peter up in the attic. The music, the noises, Peter's frantic screaming was enough for suspense. Amidst all the noise I suddenly noticed that Annie was banging on the hatch and I almost let out a laugh. Like, ""how the fuck she banging on that hatch? She using the latch hook to bang on it?? ain't no way dat bitch can reach up there to bang on dat hatch"" and then the shot transitions into her banging her head against it... The brief moment of relief I had imagining just how she was banging on the door instantly turned into the most haunting visuals I've ever seen. Complete. Fucking. 180. 

For the first time since I was in my early teens I was terrified when I went to bed. I had plans to play online games a good 2-3 hours before heading off to bed but I legit went to bed with my fiance right after the movie because I was too afraid to be up by myself.

e4fpb5w,"Steve as a character was by no means innocent as he might have seemed on the surface.  He always had a glass of booze next to him (like in bed) and thus had his own problems throughout the film.  He mocked Annie when she was in her workshop working on the crash scene by walking away, and we can see him in the hallway tapping his head like Annie is nuts.  That's not nice nor respectful to do to your wife, even if true, and especially if he is a psychiatrist.  He may have portrayed himself superficially as a great guy.  The sad part is that he couldn't help his own family.  He easily could have.  I posit that perhaps he is the worst character for this very reason:  he could have helped, chose to mentally and physically check out, and did not.  ",8pg2ma

e0cqnhg,"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm so excited that someone else realized this, and it's the first time I'm seeing it said. There is no real Charlie. Charlie was possessed as an infant by Paimon, sometime during the period that she spent with Ellen. That's why ""Charlie"" is predicting all kinds of future through her drawings, and why she is obsessed with the macabre, and why she makes the exact same creepy, pointless toys that are on Joannie's kitchen table towards the film's climax.

It's also why ""Peter"" clicks at the end after Paimon has taken over his body. That's not Peter clicking. And it's not Charlie clicking. Its Paimon clicking.

KIND OF LIKE A PIGEON.

WHICH IS WHAT SLAMS INTO THE WINDOW, AND WHAT ""CHARLIE"" CUTS THE HEAD OFF OF. AND THEN WHAT ""CHARLIE"" DRAWS IN THE NOTEBOOK WITH A CROWN ON ITS HEAD.

JUST LIKE HOW ""CHARLIE"" STUCK HER HEAD OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DECAPITATED AND THEN HER HEAD WAS USED ON THE IDOL AT THE END OF THE FILM WITH A CROWN ON ITS HEAD.

IOW, if Charlie on ocassion would float about the house, then the last need of pure fright to send you over the edge and into the peonies aint going to happen.

Scenario; Annie has friends over for a few hands of contract Bridge.

Steve: ""I'm going to make myself a drink, anyone need a bourbon?""

Friend 1: ""I'll have one neat, thanks. will you be tippling too Annie?""

Annie: ""No, I've been nursing a migraine and an awful run of anxiety attacks, depression, night terrors, sleepwalking, you know, regular unstable wife shit.""

Friend 2: ""How's Peter, haven't seen him much?""

Steve: ""up in his room blasting the chronic.""

Friend 1: ""HOLY SHIT!!!! I JUST SAW YOUR YOUNGEST FLOAT DOWN THE HALLWAY LIKE AN ADRIFT BIRTHDAY BALLOON!!!!!!!""

There are numerous scenes in which Peter isn't even present or conscious and events are presented directly to the audience from a third-person perspective. There is no reason to believe that any of the events of the film are being presented expressly from one character's point of view.

With that being said, I feel that the schizophrenia angle helps to keep the audience guessing as to whether or not the events really are delusions or not, at least up until the last few scenes or so. You're correct that Peter is around the right age for schizophrenia symptoms to begin manifesting (especially given the stress/grief and marijuana use, which are known to increase the risk for schizophrenia in at-risk individuals). However, there is also the fact that the supposed family history of mental illness may be more due to the cult activity, explained away using mental illness constructs (e.g., the grandmother's DID, or dissociative identity disorder, may likely have been a way of explaining behaviors related to the channeling or conjuring of spirits).",8pg2ma

(1). In the original movie Annie is dressed in black in the blue car with the cream interior at the beginning of the film when she is sitting on the passenger side waiting for Steve to round up the kids for her mother's funeral.  It is daylight.  We get a side shot so we see Annie's profile, while Steve heads up into the treehouse to fetch Charlie.  We never see Annie in the driver's seat of the blue car when they are heading either to or from Ellen's funeral.  When the family returns from the funeral it is still daylight.

(2). Peter drives the blue car home after the accident.  After that point in the film, we never see the blue car again at the house (exception:  the model car in the workshop).   

(3). In the trailer, Annie is sitting alone, in black, in the dark, in a car that has a cream-colored interior.
It's nighttime outside.  There are streetlights behind her, so she appears to be sitting in a parking lot, not at home, which is wooded terrain.

Thus, either this is a scene that was deleted, or we got a really quick flash of this at another time in the film and missed it.",8pg2ma

The three naked people wouldn't have been there when Steve went up, because he would have seen them.  After Steve comes out of the attic he follows Annie downstairs to the fire where he is ""fired"".  The attic ladder was left down.  The outside flips from light to dark.  Peter wakes up, at night, leaves his room.  When he leaves his room the attic ladder is back up.  Peter goes downstairs, confronts Annie and sees blonde dude in closet.  Peter runs back upstairs for some reason and when he gets to the hall the attic ladder is down.  He goes up in the attic sees Annie saw her head off and the three naked ones in the closet. Etc.

So, between the time that Steve got crisped and Peter woke up, what happened?  Annie opens the door and lets in the three naked ones, directs them to the attic?  Where are their cars, clothes and car keys?  There's no bathroom in the house so they're going to have to hold it a long time for it to get from daylight to total dark in April in Salt Lake.  The three naked ones are instructed to pull up the ladder and wait until they hear Peter walk downstairs to drop it again, as they know Peter will illogically run upstairs instead of out the three doors downstairs to get away from Annie?

Paimon needs the host to be vulnerable to sneak into their mind, explained on the same book during the paimon book shot.

e0bxmzm,"The Charlie you saw already had Paimon in her, so any of the traits (like the tongue clicking) were him not her. At the end Paimon gets reborn into Peter. The grandmother was seen in pictures being ""rewarded"" with riches meaning she was successful in giving him a body, which means Charlie was never Charlie.

The movie implies that when Paimon is given a body, he doesn't have his memories or know who he is, rather he has to relearn life in the body he has taken. Sort of a nice break from most possession movies.",8pg2ma
e0c1577,"That scene fucked me up as well. But the scariest scene in this movie was probably when Annie flies through the room behind Peter, making absolutely no sound.

Like Grandma liked Charlie, sure -- but maybe her personal opinion on her favorite grandchild should have not outweighed the downsides of having a temporary host. 

Possession is either super easy (like in the end of the movie), in which case, why was it so hard to pop Paimon into Peter when he was 5 (at the oldest; assuming Peter was 18 in the movie, and Grandma showed up for Charlie's birth). 

Or Possession is super hard and requires grooming and ritual. The cult was obviously doing stuff to images of Peter, but if they can do it all long range... well, again, why was this ever a struggle for the cult? ",8pg2ma

The look in her eyes while she's sawing her own head off though... Pay close attention to that when you see it next. Those aren't the eyes of a demon or someone who is completely lost. She looked horrified and was staring at her son, as if she had no control of her body. The face did not match up with the body. She also looked very scared when she was hiding behind him in the corner of the ceiling as he looked at his fathers burnt corpse, as if she wanted to warn him but physically couldn't because she had no control of her bodily actions.

Overall I wouldn't expect anything less from someone who watched their sister get beheaded a month or so earlier. 

And on another note, I've read a lot of stories of murder victims purportedly crying out for their parents during their last moments. I don't have anything to back it up, but I think humans have a tendency to become childlike when we're overwhelmed with fear or pain, hence mom becomes 'mommy'.

And children react to abuse and the rejection of their parents and tragedy in different ways.  And sometimes the people who seem well adjusted ie the father, turn out to be a ticking time bomb. 

I just think it’s a theme that could have been explored and would have left me a lot more scared.  Just watching a family self destruct until there is nothing else, even as everyone acts out of love and with the best intentions.  Or how a family never recovers from a tragedy. ",8pg2ma

I mean, maybe. But it seems like Paimon is able to inhabit Peter's dead body within minutes of his death, so I don't think so. 

> So I don't think the death cult ""engineered"" Charlie's death. I think that truly was an accident. When she died, the spirit of Paimon needed a new vessel, and it was the perfect opportunity to finally get him into a male vessel. Thus the appearance of Joan.

Why do we see the death cult's logo on the pole that kills Charlie, then? If that's not meant to implicate the cult in her death, it makes absolutely no sense to put that in the movie, especially since the audience has no idea what it means the first time they see it. 

> As for the Dad being set on fire, my husband's theory is that he was involved somehow (either from the get, or was currently being possessed in that scene). 

At no point does the movie indicate that the dad is even remotely involved in the scheme. We even see him drafting an email expressing concern about his wife's mental decline. He's the only sane and good character in the movie, and as such is vital as an anchor for the audience. 

> Why else hem and haw about throwing the book in the fire, unless he knew it would harm him?

Because he doesn't want to reinforce her psychosis any more than he already has. That's a perfectly reasonable and plausible explanation. A close friend of mine developed paranoid delusions not long ago, and one of the most important things when dealing w/ folks in that place is not to reinforce their delusions.

e0i35zn,"That kind of hits at my central objection — if there are any internal rules governing Paimon/the death cult, we aren't ever told what they are (even the male/female body thing is apparently just a guideline — Paimon *prefers* a male body but doesn't require one, since he inhabits Charlie for 13 years without issue). Since no limits to Paimon's powers are ever stated, he appears to be all-powerful, and if he is, then there's no reason to concoct this plan. If the idea is that there are limiting factors and only certain paths Paimon can take to get to his destination, that's never stated or even hinted at in the movie; it's simply an explanation you have to create after the fact in order to patch up a plot hole, which isn't really good scriptwork if you ask me.

He definitely goes up in flames, but she could have hallucinated that there was no trail of fire from the fireplace to him, etc. She was carrying a jug of flammable liquid, some of which spilled on the floor, after all.

>we definitely see him react to hearing Charlie's voice coming from Annie.

I don't think thats true sadly, as the viewers (*and only the viewers*) see a specific shot of inside Joan's home and all the ritualistic objects involving peter and charlie. None of the characters see that scene, it is purely for the audience. That grounds it, and the whole cult storyline in reality for me. The father also see's the seance, the flame, the glass move and the possession of his wife. So it can't have just been Annie & Peter going insane.

Throughout the movie he kept on adding to the chaos of what was going on, building up and up and when it was time to take it home, he didn't knew how to properly resolve it. 

I've seen people compare this movie to Mother! regarding the way that it makes you feel with all that's going on but Aronofsky knew how to properly ""put the lid"" on his movie. While Hereditary might be an entertaining film, it is nowhere near Mother!

Well that's some nonsense.

I would agree with you there.

I'll disagree. And from what I've seen in this thread, your claim isn't particularly popular even among the fans--seems like the final act (where everything becomes blatantly supernatural) is often the weakest part for fans as well.

I'm happy that a lot of people like it, but I just had a different opinion.

e0chohi,"> but if you think The Witch and It Comes at Night are not good

At what point did I say they were *not good* movies?

You can read my review of [It Comes At Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6g6n4c/official_discussion_it_comes_at_night_spoilers/dio478g/) there if you want to see what I thought of it, and I would do the same with The VVitch but I can't seem to find my comment on the official discussion thread. I might have accidentally deleted it a couple years ago? 

But in short I do not find them bad movies, and The VVitch is much better than ICAN. They are both in their own way captivating, engrossing, and build tension well. They both however never pay off for me. You can keep ratcheting up the tension and building suspense but if there's no release then it's all just a big tease and a let down. 

The VVitch at least I still like as it is expertly crafted and phenomenal, so I've watched it a few more times since release and it holds up. But I can't bring myself to watch ICAN again as it feels more like a chore to watch.",8pg2ma

This movie is way, way different. The Conjuring is scary, but this movie is truly horrifying. It makes you feel real terror, the kind that you can't get away from and the kind that won't leave you.

Hereditary was extremely scary and....man, when she talked about her family history of mental illness, I was so, so sure that we were seeing grief being shown exhibiting itself through madness onscreen in a great, great way. Instead, the plot makes zero sense, and you have to explain away everything (who was choking peter? Why? How did the seance work? How did Paimons power work? Why did it get stronger at the end?

There are 72 demons detailed in the book. King Paimon is #9 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paimon). Paimon is a demon king who helps rule over hell, but he still answers to Lucifer. He is usually depicted as a man riding a camel, and sometimes is shown wearing the crown, but sometimes the camel wears the crown instead. He is said to be preceded by men playing loud trumpets, and he has a hoarse voice but can be commanded to speak normally. Paimon has knowledge of many things, including all science and art, Earth/water/wind, and the past and future. He can bestow this knowledge onto humans, and will answer questions truthfully. **He is also said to know where treasures are located, he can grant lordship to people, he can grant familiars, he can reanimate the dead, and he can conjur visions that people can see, all of which are touched on in the film.**

It was well integrated but nothing wasnt seen in a lot of other films of the general genre. 

For me it's a good film that is mildly evolving because of genre blending rather than moving either of those genres forward with anything new just polish in the execution and acting. 

I have seen many more interesting indie films that have evolved the genre but I can't say they were better made films. 

Edit:  I have to say I could easily see the ending they chose completely undermining and nullifying all the drama about loss and dealing with difficult family relations as the grandmother was the way she was due to being a cult member and the daughter not really being what the parents thought minimizing the validity of the grief.

e0maw64,"> I'm really glad you made this comment, because people in this thread are ready to pounce on people for not liking the movie, and claiming that they're not smart enough to understand it and want more generic horror movies.

Yep. I've gotten into it with some of them. The most frustrating thing is being told that you must not have understood the movie. It's like, no I understood it fine, I just thought certain elements were ineffective or conveyed poorly.

> I was way more invested in the family dynamics, the different ways each member was grieving, and the ways schizophrenia was playing a part in the more supernatural aspects of the film (before it just literally became a movie about a demon cult).

Exactly. Someone left me a comment that I felt perfectly described this film, calling it a very effective 90 minute family-based psychological thriller, with a disparate 30 minute occult horror short tacked on the the end. Both are good in their own right, but the latter kind of undercuts the former.

> I was feeling like it was a movie akin to The Babadook which took a physical manifestation of a monster and made it about grief and learning to live with it instead of trying to ignore it.

That's a great comparison too. I felt like that film more elegantly presented the transition from the real life frustration of having a terribly behaved child to the physical manifestation of that horror though, if only in that it built up over the course of the film - not just abruptly at the end.

> Overall I thought the film was very good, I just wish they shot a different ending.

Agreed. The one thing I'll say though is that the more I reflect on this film, the more it has grown on me. I think it's because it's just so goddamn well made and well acted that I *want* to love it, so part of me is willing to overlook some of these shortcomings that left my head spinning coming out of the theater - the most egregious being that voiceover at the end. Without that exposition it'd be ambiguous whether he was actually this Demon King, or if this was the beginning of his own delusional schizophrenic breakdown like his mother's. Normally that type of ""Maybe it was all a dream..."" vagueness frustrates the hell out of me, but this is a rare case where I think it would have been appropriate.",8pg2ma

e1pvmu9,"I don't claim to be able to explain away everything but:

- Paimon is a demon; he's not the Devil himself. He's powerful but not all-powerful.

But I don't think it's inherently inconsistent to say that a spirit which can float around freely can't just go around possessing people's bodies at will. Something else might need to happen for him to take over a human body.  
- I don't necessarily think the light aura was always Paimon. It could have been another spirit, like that of the grandmother.  
- Generally speaking, I think you (and some other critics) are assuming that *all* the supernatural stuff in the movie has to be directly related to Paimon and moving Paimon into the body he wants. I think the cult had other powers due to their service to Paimon, one of which may have been their spirits hanging around after death and generally messing with the boundaries between the world of the living and the dead. Hence the grandmother's image appearing in the house, hence various spooky things happening before the actual seance took place.

I'm with you, however, on the confusion over why Paimon is addressed as Charlie at the very end (while in Peter's body). I can sort of see some kind of explanation relating to that being the last body he possessed and therefore the name by which he knows himself, but yeah, it seems weird that he'd be at all attached to the Charlie identity after spending time in so many different bodies over the ages.",8pg2ma

But Annie still made Peter take Charlie. So then he asks her if she feels responsible for Charlie's death as well. Up until that point it seems like Annie was completely blaming Peter.

The grandmother wasn't allowed near Peter as a child, so she couldn't properly imprint on him and prep him for becoming host to Paimon.

So she worked with what she had. She was allowed to be around Charlie when Charline was born, so she prepped Charlie's spirit for what was to come, even though Charlie's body never would have been able to support Paimon (Paimon needed a male body). Everything that happened in the film was the grandmother's overarching plan to prep Peter's body for Charlie's spirit (which the grandmother had been corrupting for 13 years), which in turn would allow Paimon the access he needed to take his human vessel.

I wasn’t satisfied with how all these dots were connected though. There wasn’t that grand “aha” moment that I felt with other films, like “The Prestige.” 

Once the audience is given the opportunity to put the film together it just ends, and we are led to believe that the fate of Peter/Charlie will befall someone else.

Well, my favorite horror movies are The Thing, Evil Dead 2, The Neon Demon, American Psycho and It Follows. Here's my favorite movies in general: https://letterboxd.com/dexxbateman/list/favorite-movies/

> . Its a thought provoking thriller, not an outright gag or jumpscare horror film.

Some of it was thought provoking. Like the way it touched on mental illness. I figured the whole movie would be about that, but nope, it ends up being about stupid satanic cult bullshit, which is not thought provoking at all, just something boring that has been done in 100 other shitty movies already.

>  As far as the acting goes I thought it was superb! How else are you supposed to behave when descending into madness?

By not over acting? You can ""descend into madness"" in a way that is believable and doesn't look stupid. Toni Collette was really good at times, but at other times it was just over the top. The son was okay at times, and awful at others. The dream sequence where she goes into his room at night and he cries was laughable.

The only thing we can assume Steve actually saw was the dead body, and he even said to Annie ""you dug this up!"" Of course, Annie was also in that scene, as she was when Steve said ""what is that smell?"" so it's also possible that his behaviors were part of Annie's episodes. Him getting burned may also be Annie's actions, though the scene was designed such that we could be either seeing what happened, or what Annie was seeing.

e0gj45h,"Fair enough. I just don’t believe in the supernatural and find that a realistic lens can make this movie more scary. 

Here’s why I think it was all in her head. 

-She’s creates miniature worlds. Sees things and creates scenarios in her head. Sometimes it keeps her reality in perspective but when it’s smashed she becomes deranged. 

If her sleepwalking can make her almost kill her children. Then she can...

Imagine Joanne, which is always one on one on screen. 

Place Joanne’s stitched mat in an apartment and start conducting conjurings by herself. 

Kill her husband, because the paint thinner was placed beside her feet when her husband walked over to the fireplace. You could assume, she was imagining his negativity, when in fact he was over by the fireplace and she sprayed paint thinner on him. This is evident from her reaction going from erratic to calm. 

Then she hangs herself in the attic. 

The boy, however, fearing his mother wanting to kill him begins to imagine her after him. The cult is a metaphor of denial for killing his sister. We hear Joanne but we don’t see her. Because Joanne has always been metaphor for mental illness seeping in at breaking points. 

That’s my two cents, anyway. I’m trying to give the director more credit than I would because if we’re really gonna believe that it is all literal and people float, conjure demons, and pray to evil spirits I find that really hokey and frankly not scary. ",8pg2ma
e0fn0wq,"Yeah, this was what I was hoping for the whole time. There's something about the ability to pass it off as insanity that makes it even scarier in my opinion. 

When the son jumped out the window I thought that would have been a perfect place to end. I was thinking maybe he had ""inherited"" whatever illness his grandmother and mother had, and was pushed into it earlier by his mother's decline. But the very end kind of kills that interpretation, which is a shame.",8pg2ma
e0foy3r,"For starters, the only characters who are ever sold on it being supernatural are Annie and Peter, both of whom may have the hereditary DID. The dad is never sold and suggests up until his death that Annie is going crazy. The only thing supernatural that happens to the only character we can assume is sane is 1) he bursts into flames, and 2) he sees stuff move during the seance. But we know that Annie, in some sort of mental break, has attempted to catch her children on fire, and has nightmares of catching her son on fire. So if nothing supernatural was really happening, then Annie justifies her catching her husband on fire by viewing it as supernatural. If that’s the case, the only supernatural thing that the husband witnesses is a glass move, and his wife becoming “possessed” by Charlie (or a Charlie personality emerging within Annie).

For the finale of the movie, Peter, who for all we know could also be insane, sees Joan yelling spells at him at school (that nobody else acknowledges), witnesses his mom floating, and ends up becoming possessed by his sister. 

So, how the “events are actually just delusions from Annie and Peter” scenario would’ve played out:

After Charlie’s death, Annie and Peter’s dormant disorders are becoming more prevalent. Annie digs up her mother’s grave and beheads her, and stores her in the attic (the grave is vandalized before Charlie’s death, but we don’t know to what extent, and the complains about smell don’t happen until much later in the movie, which takes place over many months). Her husband believes she’s having a mental breakdown and says so in an email to somebody (says “another” iirc). When he suggests this, she catches him on fire. Her mind attempts to justify this as a supernatural event, but after she does this she hangs herself in the attic. Peter finds his mother hanging (floating) and his mind warps that to a similar supernatural event (his mom actually floating around the house). This sequence results in him allowing his new personality, one that mimic’s Charlie, to take over. 

So where this take on it starts to fall apart is 1) Joan, who Peter sees yelling at him in a supernatural scene, but we don’t have any evidence that they’ve ever met before, and 2) the cult ending, which Peter wouldn’t really have any reason to imagine since we don’t know that he has any knowledge of the cult. 

But, if we never saw Joan yelling at Peter, and if the movie ended with Peter making the Charlie clicking noise, then hereditary insanity would’ve definitely been my takeaway from the movie. ",8pg2ma

I feel like this film was lacking. The characters were unlikable (unlike the father and teen daughter from The Witch), a good 40% of the movie has scenes that aren't supposed to be scary, but also aren't particularly interesting either. I liked most of these scenes, especially in how covertly they drove the narrative, but on the surface they were pretty meh to look at. I would say another  35% of the film had scenes that were trying to be creepy and unnerving, but most did not startle me at all. It didn't help that I thought Peter's acting was severely lacking for over half the movie. The obviously fake crying really killed it for me when Charlie started talking from Annie's body.

&#x200B;

The final 25% of the film, however, was absolutely terrifying. The last 30 minutes had my palms sweating so much they stank and definitely kept me on my toes. I love how as time goes on I find I can appreciate the movie more. I was deeply disturbed by this final part. I can confidently say that I've never been scared like this before.

&#x200B;

I like to rate films by how much I enjoyed them overall, however. I have watched The Witch 4 times and love it every time. I would hate to watch this movie again only for the last 30 minutes. Most of the film I was pretty bored, unlike The Witch which kept me on edge. I also thought the plot about this prince of Hell was not very intriguing, unlike seeing Satan himself in The Witch.

You add to the occult imagery, the production company, etc. plus it only adds to the theme that is present in Hereditary about passing down of traditions (I mean it’s literally the title of the movie) and to think that the families in both movies are connected and it actually adds a level of disturbance.

I feel like a lot of the fans went in with a heads up about the direction of the plot, I didn't even read a summary. In fact, the summary at the start of this topic almost seems NECESSARY to be able to get on track with the plot. Otherwise, like in my case, you get misled with all these different scenes and events that don't appear to be related. A mystery is great, but not when it's something you can't follow until the ending exposition. 

I laughed, and so did several others, when the body (or cultist, not sure) in the white gown ascended up into the treehouse. It was so bizarre and fluid and it reached a breaking point.

So there's kind of two ways to approach horror as a genre.

One is to set up jump scares and creep outs that pay off right away.

The other is to build a sense of existential dread.

This film doesn't use jump scares much, a couple and a few redirects, but its huge on building that existential dread. It's a cerebral film. The slow pacing gives you loads of time to explore each character's mental state after Charlie's horrific death.

You are given tons of time to really ruminate on how Annie feels, how Peter feels, etc.

Then it's tied together with the external plot of this cult who has been manipulating this family for decades, and that this is all largely outside of their control.

You have to be willing to suspend some disbelief while also putting a lot of your own thoughts into the mindset and feelings of each character.

If that's not your thing, I can absolutely see how it could come up short for you. ",8pg2ma

Add that to the movie prepping you to be objective.  There are a lot of things, like the pamphlet that comes through the their mail calling all sceptics.  The teachers are all giving lessons on reality as well.  The movie is telling you to be watch with a sceptical eye.

You see her outside Joan's house the second time knocking and we see the camera, that gives a true view, just her knocking, when it cuts inside that is what Mom believes would be in there.  Shit I don't think she ever met Joan.  It is just a woman she saw in pictures and built her into this delusion.",8pg2ma

e17jmvg,"I think a big part of it was I did have a lot of anxiety from unrelated life things when I saw it and I think maybe the state of mind I was in actually contributed quite a lot to how I perceived the movie. Walking out of it I felt like the first chunk of it was just sad and depressing (with everything that happened to Charlie and the mom's reaction), and then from that point on I felt either bored or ambivalent. I guess I'm struggling to appreciate it because I've seen other movies like Requiem for a Dream that I would consider quite disturbing and made me feel much more uncomfortable than this one yet I Absolutely loved it because it felt like had real heartbreak, tragedy, and emotion behind it where as in this movie it felt like I was watching some family I don't care about being torn apart and so yeah it was uncomfortable but I never really cared about anybody in the movie. I don't know if this also contributes but this was also the first modern horror film I've seen, every other horror film that I've seen and enjoyed have been ones from the 70s and 80s, things like the Poltergeist or The Shining or something like that.

e0jsjky,"Yeah I've asked here before going to the movie and that's what most people have said. That's why I'm pretty surprised.

>The movie felt more like an intense drama than a horror movie

I felt the same way about The VVitch and A Quiet Place honestly. All three of these movies have very intense quiet moments where nothing happens and when something eventually does happen it's just a small noise meant for a jumpscare.

Her brother wasn't given one when they were leaving the house

The 13 year old isn't in charge of her own epi pen for some reason

e0dus3f,">A lot of people here are talking about the film's incredible attention to detail. Many of the shots are enthralling as Annie's miniatures, which share the metaphysical quality of a family powerless to stop an outside power from manipulating their fates.

Attention to detail? Yeah no, gonna disagree with you there. They couldn't even have a reason for why the 13 year old isn't in charge of her own epi pen. The miniatures were annoying because I was fully aware of the deeper meaning behind it but that was before being forced to sit through literally ten minutes of nothing happening and just static shots of a close up of the miniatures. 

>I'd say you didn't connect with them. Despite the phenomenal acting.

Yeah sorry find it really hard to connect with an insane woman. I feel like you people are playing way into the whole mentally ill aspect of the movie and pretending it's something others are supposed to relate to. If I'm watching a horror movie, why am I supposed to relate to the characters? I connected with the father because I felt sorry for him and then the movie killed him with shitty CGI.

>You ask why people like the movie but it doesn't seem like you bothered to read why people liked it.

Because everyone thinks it was actually scary? The comments here are people saying they liked it because it was good use of a slow burn when in sure as hell wasn't. People seem to genuinely think this is a scary movie when there is not a single moment in the movie where you're afraid something bad is going to happen. The slow burn just leads you into everything nice and slowly to the point when something does happen you've had enough time to anticipate it and it becomes not scary whatsoever. I've said it a million times, the reviews are mislabelling it as ""perfect horror"" when it is in no way even close to being that, the movie is barely horror.

>our post reads like someone who went into the movie looking for things to dislike

Excuse me? So just because I had serious issues with the movie **after** seeing it, I'm not allowed to just think it's a shit movie and I only disliked it because I wanted to dislike it. See that plays into why I'm starting to hate it more and more I think about it. Because I'm being told that I'm wrong for simply bringing up reasons where the movie fell flat and disliking it with great passion. I didn't watch the trailer, I went in blind. According to the comments here I should have watched the trailer first.

>Are you afraid of the vulnerability that is generally required of a viewer to be moved by art?

Jesus christ what an egotistical thing to say because someone disliked a movie. No I'm not afraid that I need to be ""vulnerable"" to watch a scary movie, in fact I'd argue that no one should need to feel vulnerable to enjoy a movie. If your movie can't convey it's message across without pretending it's deep and edgy, then it's not a good movie. This movie was an hour and a half of absolutely nothing happening. Fucking nothing. Usually with a slow burn, you have filler in the middle, you know to keep the viewer occupied. But does this movie have any? Fuck no. If your movie is going to be two god damn hours long that jesus christ have something going on **before** the climax.

I don't know what your problem is. I seriously disliked the movie and I'm trying to find an actual reason for why it deserves praise but all I'm finding is the same repeated garbage about it being a perfect ""horror"" movie. Just because I hated it doesn't mean I didn't understand it, didn't connect with the characters, can't understand art, etc. It was just a bad movie, plain and simple. Shit on me for saying it, but at least the teen horror movies have some kind of substance to keep you entertained during the movie.

You know adoptions an option for people like that who dont want to pass on those genes.

Maybe you forget the part where she pressured the daughter into going with Peter. Yeah I agree with Peter, she didnt want to go and the mother forced her into going. If you're placing blame on Peter than you need to place blame on the mother too.

Or you know, the fact that she thinks she should be forgiven for almost killing both of them. She fucking covered them in wood varnish and had a match lit and ready to burn them alive. But oh no. Peters the shitty son for not forgiving his mother for nearly murdering him and his sister. Seriously the scene with her and Joan with her crying about how her son doesnt forgive her is fucking shit because what kind of shitty person would think **anyone** would forgive someone for doing that.

Oh and not only to mention that Peter is clearly fucking terrified of his mother because her mental illness has been ravaging that family. Oh she was broken? I feel so bad for her.

I find the supernatural aspect really annoyed me as well. Monsters/gore/killers/ghosts etc are good for cheap thrills but I really felt the moment this movie starting going on about psychics/seance's/demons it really diverged.

[The whole point is that Paimon prefers to have a male host, but in order to inhabit the body, the body must be vulnerable. It couldn't do that with Peter as a baby because Annie was estranged at the time. That's why Granny tells Charlie she wished she were a boy. That's why Grandpa went crazy and starved himself to death. That's why Annie's brother Charles was ""schizophrenic"" and and accused the grandmother of ""putting people inside him"" - because she WAS. It's *possibly* how Joan's son and grandson died - a failed attempt to host the demon. But it's easier for demons to inhabit vulnerable bodies, so basically the whole point after grandma's death is to break Peter to turn him into a vulnerable host body for the demon](#spoiler)",8pg2ma

we see no police investigation or counselors talking to peter or anyone from the party or anyone at school talking about it at all or treating him any differently. even when he has his panic attack smoking weed his friends are behind him laughing about some girl who posts too many facebook statuses (eyes roll out of head). no one is acting like this insane thing took place and like....even if people didn't blame peter for it and felt bad, the ENTIRE town would have been talking about that shit just because of how gross and sad it was. i cannot buy that they would not i just can't.

(also, re: charlie going to the party in the first place--i believe a mother calling her son's bluff when he plans on drinking underage while borrowing her car. i do NOT believe that she would actually make him go through with it when neither of them were into the idea. also, we see charlie's parents talk to her explicitly about her nut allergy twice, even referencing her epi pen. annie is under the impression that peter and charlie are going to a bbq. we are supposed to believe that she would not make them bring it?! i understand that she didn't bring it to the funeral but how many nuts does one usually encounter there? on top of that, who bakes cakes for/at high school parties? also they were chopping an enormous amount of nuts on an enormous cutting board in the open room peter and charlie were in the whole time. i don't believe that neither of them would have seen that or that she would not have tasted it. also, charlie looks waaay younger but is said to be thirteen. that is old enough to understand a nut allergy especially if your parents--sometimes--care so much about it. so i also do not buy her walking into the room where peter is and saying ""my throat feels like it's getting bigger"" instead of omfg bro i must have eaten a nut. hospital NOW. i refuse to believe she could not have anticipated or articulated that better.)

e1cyjo3,">Is that why Annie kept Peter away from her mom but let Charlie be close with her mom? Because she knew, at least on some level, about her mother's beliefs?

I hadn't thought about it that way, but that makes sense to me. My initial thoughts on that came from the whole ""I feel blamed"" speech at the grief counseling group. I figured she felt guilty for keeping Ellen away from Peter, so she let her be around Charlie. But I think there may well be some truth to your interpretation, given the particular words Annie uses during that monologue, like how she said she let Ellen ""hook her claws into"" Charlie, or something like that.

I figured the necklace was either just a memento of her mom or some kind of talisman her mom used to connect her to Paimon. I don't remember the letter you mentioned. What did it say?

I thought the exact same as you about the notebook. I was sure Annie was trying to make Steve sacrifice himself to Paimon, and I was (and still am) confused about that scene when that turned out not to be the case. Did she know that would happen? And why did it burn him instead of her?

I think Annie knew Ellen was into some sketchy activities, to a certain extent. At the funeral she acknowledged all the unfamiliar faces in attendance and that that was due to the fact that Ellen had ""private rituals, private friends."" In Ari Aster's AMA (which is really good, you should check it out if you haven't already) he said that Annie had at least some subconscious knowledge of Paimon's plan, and that's why she tried to burn her children alive while she was sleepwalking: she knew deep down that killing them was the only way to save them from him, so her subconscious took over while she slept and attempted to do so.",8pg2ma

So they start crying at one another because Peter thinks Annie hates him and Annie's trying to convince him otherwise even though she seemingly is about to kill him. Then when it reaches its peak they are suddenly both drenched in lighter fluid and she wakes up. It was was a crazy scene, very emotional and creepy. I think typing it out doesn't do it justice. 

Unfortunately I don't remember the explanation of Annie's brother and father, maybe it happened during this tangent that she went on in regards to how the grandma was never around. I do believe they both killed themselves, that's one of the reasons why at first it's tough to tell if Annie is possessed or just suffering from depression and grief. 

At the end the scene becomes very Rosemary's Baby where we learn that this is all very real and very satanic. These nude figures, some alive, some decapitated are kneeling and praying to this figure composed of the sisters decapitated head and Peter is praised for being the new king (I forgot what they called him). It was weird, really screwed up (due to this movies use of decapitation), and goes into a realm of fantasy almost. A dark fantasy, but a fantasy nonetheless.

e1fe683,"Damn. Sorry you had to go through that... it does sound really similar to the movie. I don't think anyone should be put in a situation like that before they're even a teenager. A kid's formative years shouldn't include actual parties.

I guess there are some lessons for a future parent that I can take from the movie.

Like hopefully I can maintain a relationship with my son where he wouldn't *have* to lie, because he knows that if he's honest I'll absolutely let him go out, learn, and make mistakes (and then call for a ride at any time). If he's honest about it, then I know not to send his sibling along this time. Seems like a parental dynamic that results in good things.

e18hy6g,"No, that's not true. The movie did not terrify me at all, and it was hilariously bad at times. 

It also had a variety of good scenes, but let me point one out. Like the beheading. 

He's ""speeding"" along this pretty flat road, and he's only going 70? Bad. Swerve into the beheading? Also bad. Very unlikely she gets decapitated instead of thrown from the car. The human body is quite resilient. 100% dead, but decapitation is unlikely. 

Then onto the shock. Doesn't know what to do. Stammering. Drives home and goes into bed. Pretty good. Mom eventually finds her daughter and cries. Good.

And then they cut that scene together to her bedroom, then the funeral, and she has the same crying sound for all it. Bad. Because it's hilarious to think she's crying the same exact way for entire days. 

Not that she wouldn't be crying, but the same way? The same tones? Not even close to real. It reminded me of a scene from American Dad where Roger is crying about something, and every scene is linked by this crying. Like he's driving to school, still crying. Eating cereal, still crying. It's objectively funny.

Because I remember my mom when her mother and sister died within a month of each other. I woke up to the sound of her wailing. And she still cries to this day sometimes, but with nowhere near that fervor. It died down within an hour. The human body can't sustain that for very long.

Still confused how he is actually able to do what he does though. ",8pg2ma

Remember when she was sleepwalking, and she was telling peter that she didn’t want to have him, and she tried to stop it, but her mother made her?

I don't believe that Paimon has *that* much influence on the world around but was just doing a bunch of things to put Charlie in jeopardy and it worked that time.  Peter was stoned, Paimon has Charlie eat the cake and have an allergic reaction.    I think that's why Steve and Annie are always scolding Charlie like she's constantly putting herself in jeopardy.   She gets yelled at for sleeping in the treehouse, walking around barefoot outside, if she's eating candy with nuts.  To me that aligns more with a god of mischief, just constantly putting Charlie in dangerous situations and letting it play out.  ",8pg2ma

e0dxwyq,I'm pretty sure there was a shot of Steve at an office later in the film when he's called by Peter's school after Peter bashes his face in. They show the school trying to call the home but Annie is out of it and doing her crazy stuff/research and then they cut to Steve in what looks like a nice office with him sipping on a drink and checking emails.

It's completely possible that most everything that happened after Charlie's death wasn't real or we didn't see it in the way it actually happened, but instead from the psychosis viewpoint of the wife or her son.

e0dc25z,"I don't know if the question is ever really answered, actually. It could maybe be either real or psychosis. If you notice, nothing supernatural ever happens in front the husband (except for the first seance). Whenever something crazy is happening it seems like it is from the perspective of annie or her kids and they seem to be having separate psychoses. 

Like for instance remember when joanie was yelling at peter through the fence but no one noticed except for him? Or when charlie saw their grandma in the field but the mom didn't? 

I don't know. In the end I think the viewer is left to decide.",8pg2ma
e0g0qfk,"There was one scene where Annie positioned the figurine of the grandmother in the doorway of her bedroom (in the miniature house) while the husband and Annie slept. I can't figure what that was all about. I could never decide if the mother was in on everything on a subconscious level (hence the title, Hereditary), or not. For instance, she forced Charlie to go to the party, and the inscription on the pole which Charlie was decapitated seemed to suggest that everything was planned. Did the mother somehow know this plan subconsciously? ",8pg2ma

e0bzb07,"The entire movie is about the the passing of mental illness from one family member to the next.  They set it up early when Annie is talking about how sick her mom got at the end with dementia and DID which is dissociative identity disorder.

What we are seeing is how this condition is hereditary, hence the name of the movie.  

The first time she goes to Joan's house you see her take a pill for the last time.  She also admits in that once ""sleepwalking"" covered her and her kids in paint thinner and was going to light them on fire but it hasn't happened in years.  That is what the pills were for as she had been disassociating.   That is the very last time you see her take a pill and also the reason shit starts get get crazier and crazier as she is off her meds so what you are seeing are her paranoid delusions.

Since she is our point of view character for a lot of the movie we are seeing things through her eyes so we can't trust a lot of it which reframes the movie a lot.  

She is doing the ""sleepwalking"" and is the one that dug up her mother and brought her back there when going through an episode.    

There is like, a ton to unpack here but let me bring up one for you to think about.  The death of the father.  Why did she have lighter fluid to burn a book?  It is a book you can just toss that in the fire and it will go up no problem, she already got it on fire pretty easy the last time.  

She doused her husband and lit him on fire, she talked before about almost doing it to her and her kids in the past, as they set up before and she also has that dream where her and her son also burn again. ",8pg2ma

And yes his crush seemed off. Sitting by herself at the party, deadpan and kind of detached. The same party that was weirdly serving chocolate cake (which was Charlie’s favorite) and chopping nuts in a very uncanny way. My initial thought was that she was in on the cult and the peanut allergy reaction was orchestrated by the cult. But that’s pure speculation. From what I could see, almost everyone in the cult was older and you never see his crush with them at the end. But it’s still an interesting thought.",8pg2ma

Apparently according to Wikipedia one of Paimon's powers is staying underwater indefinitely. The theory is that both Joanie's son and grandson were potential vessels, but it was hard to tell whether Paimon had entered them. They were forced underwater to tell if Paimon had entered them, thus the drowning.

e5alhsq,"I think there are two ways to interpret the meaning of the film: 

One, that this film is a metaphor for mental illness, and the cult of Paimon was there to illustrate the fact that those who experience hereditary mental illness can never truly escape it, no matter how hard they fight against it. (see: The father never experiencing any unnatural phenomena because the illness does not run in his bloodline.)

And two, that the film is being literal in its portrayal of cult-worshipping psychos, and that Paimon has been passed through the mother's bloodline for generations. The curse is the same: Anyone of that bloodline will be terrorized until they either die, or are possessed by Paimon.

Personally, I'm a big supporter of the mental illness metaphor version, but the symbol of the buried houses sculpture applies to either interpretation of it. A curse spanning generations, whether it be real or in their heads.
(I should probably see it a second time so I can see any other subtext within the film, but I've been too fucking scared to, lol)",8pg2ma
e0fks9q,"Yeah that pretty much sums up the way I felt about it all the way to the end. There are a few areas that don't make complete sense to me, like how well Peter would have known about Paimon in the first place. Also Peters appearance is different from the rest of the family, but maybe that just added a layer of alienation. I really enjoy how the events of the movie leave both explanations possible",8pg2ma

e0chzri,"I totally get that, and I’m actually the same as you when it comes to wanting to immerse myself. I love getting lost in a world that a film builds which is why I go to the theater in the first place rather than wait for netflix.

That being said, the movie itself just didn’t make that possible for me. I thought where it succeeded beautifully in creating very immersive human drama, it failed at making a sufficiently immersive supernatural storyline because it was too in love with the lore of what it was talking about. We didn’t need all the Paimon backstory for it to be scary or interesting, and it made it a little long winded and hokey by the end of the third act. I prefer a movie that lets the audience infer things but due to the amount of subplots, heavy handed symbolism and backstory it had to juggle there was sooo much exposition the characters had to give. I honestly felt myself tuning out during the explanations of the supernatural parts because they detracted from the core of the story, which was the family dynamic.",8pg2ma

e7h8az0,One thing I'm still confused about is...were they just banking on Charlie randomly dying at some point in her childhood or did the supernatural somehow play a roll in ensuring Charlie died in that car ride home from the party?  I know Annie was adamant that Charlie go with her brother even though she clearly didn't want to.  I don't think Paimon was able to take control of the son as that seems to have been the end game goal.,8pg2ma
e7l9985,Charlie is definitely possessed by Paimon.  The little effigies that she creates were also in Joans home at the end when Annie went there to confront her but couldn't get an answer.  The pentagram was on the table with Peters picture and many of those effigies were laid about.,8pg2ma

e0myolc,"Shock, denial, disbelief, and fear make a human act very very very weird. He’s young, and to go from 100-0 so quickly is very hard to comprehend for any human being. He was just going so fast, hearing his sister gasping in the backseat, and then, nothing. He killed his own sister. Decapitated her. It’s so surreal that your body would literally not understand how to handle the situation. 

Him driving home was a very clear sign of him denying that any of it was real.  He didn’t want to believe what he had just done, and I think in a way, he mentally couldn’t.  It didn’t feel like a dream/daze to him anymore whenever his mom found the body.

e1g4438,I think the idea is that they had Alex Wolff willing to star and knew he would bring a younger crowd so they decided to overlook the fact that he looked way too old for the role and looked adopted.

Charlie is a creepy kid, odd fascination with making dolls, we mostly see her fixating on the dolls’ heads, and cutting the head off the pigeon. She also has that vision of Ellen sitting in the field surrounded by fire the afternoon before the car accident. I assumed that Paimon was somehow merged with Charlie through Ellen’s efforts, but couldn’t be fully realized because she was a girl.

There's a drawing in Charlie's book that shows the bird with a crown on its head. Then, during the final scene, we see a photograph of Annie's mother with a label that says ""Queen."" There was a sense of royal tradition, in the normal sense, which even plays into the title - historically, monarchies were continued through blood, the son taking the crown of the father. And of course, Peter is literally crowned right before the final speech.

I took the headlessness to be symbolic of giving up the right (and ability) to wear the crown, and to ensure that no female wore it.",8pg2ma

However, I just admire that psychosis is definitely possible.

The POV being omniscient doesn't really discredit it, in my head that is :p. Because that's what Annie's hobby is, creating omnicient models of her life. Even more so, because the film explicitly starts off ""inside"" the models. 

The director has stated that this was more to emphasise the lack of agency of any of the main characters and how they are just pawns in the game the cult is playing. I just think it lines up perfectly with the lack of agency a person would feel as a victim of hereditary mental disease. 

Thanks for posting, I'm loving the shit out of picking this film apart :D the POV was a good catch, I didn't even notice it! EDIT: In fact you could argue it's a symptom of her psychosis kicking into a higher gear, now that I think of it. ",8pg2ma

e0j0goj,That's what I like most about the film is that it really does operate under multiple readings. And what I found cool about all the occult easter eggs is that on a visceral level it kind of makes the viewer paranoid in much the same way a paranoid schizophrenic might be.,8pg2ma
e0jncuo,"The thing I keep pointing out to folks that think it was all schizo, is that apart from only the father knowing about the exhumation and the audience's knowledge that the mother wasn't digging it up when she was ""at the movies"" because she was at a support group, there are several scenes that have items in them which only the audience is shown.

e0w25b0,"I laughed at a two major ""terrifying"" points in the movie, so lemme give you my reasoning at least ? -

1. when Annie's first on the ceiling then scurries away still on the wall
2. head banging on the attic door

I thought she would float away, but the way she moved was just so unnatural that it broke my suspension of disbelief. Plus, the scene was so dark and her nightgown was lit (so we could see, obv) but there was no source of light to illuminate her. I'm a photographer and considering movie PA is essentially the same as photography PA, it made me not focus on the movie and instead I was trying to figure out how they shot the scene/added CGI.

Then the head banging came pretty much immediately after, right? Once you know the secrets behind the magic tricks the tricks aren't as thrilling, I guess. :/",8pg2ma

e4vnvn7,"Maybe the demon was like a telemarketer and was attempting access to both Peter and the Mom simultaneously following Charlie's death? Whichever one ""accepted the call"" first got fully possessed.  Demon knows he can use Mom's possession to get to Peter eventually anyway.  

Peter's scene in the classroom happens before Dad's death.  Dad's death sends Mom over the edge to a weakened state where she can be fully possessed, but it takes Mom's death to finally put Peter over the edge.  I think your decapitation to possess theory is sound.",8pg2ma
e4yqqgk,"I like this. But im having trouble placing when the possesion of the mom actually took place..

Say Charlie is possesed when she decapitates the bird. When does it pass to mom? Right after dad is burned to a crisp, when Peter comes home to find his body? And then mom is freaking out, acting all weird, and ends up decapitating herself, thereby transfering the demon to the now very vulnerable Peter.",8pg2ma

A few people said one of Peter’s teachers made an appearance. And just going off of the basic physical breakdown of the cult members: white, middle aged, somewhat dumpy physiques, etc. That matches with teachers, funeral attendants, and support group members. Too much of this film is intentional to have there be no connection between those groups and the cult members.",8pg2ma
e0hjo5y,"The tip off here for me was that was where Joan and Annie first connected at the grief group. 

To be honest I wasn’t paying attention enough to the group members at the beginning because I hadn’t suspected anything. I thought Joan was a nice little old lady until that weird moment at Joan’s house where Annie found that green little thing in her mouth after she drank her tea. Then I remembered the same weird little fingers to lips scene at the funeral. (I think it was Joan putting something into Annie’s mother’s mouth) It gives me reason to suspect that there are too many connections to every character and nuance, especially to the “extras” of the movie.

e7rwhx8,"I think that’s a fair assessment, and after reading interviews with the director, it seems that he lacked the depth as a storyteller to even consider that possibility.  He intended for it all to be taken quite literally, which i found disappointing.  

I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt by saying to myself that even though she was out of his line of sight, she was still potentially in the periphery of his vision or simply a hallucination he was only vaguely experiencing.  Her flying across the room behind him could be his addled brain’s translation of a breeze across the back of his neck, and her crouched on the ceiling was a representation of the eerie feeling he had for the hairs on the back of his neck standing at attention.  A bit of a stretch, I’ll admit, but I watched Mandy the night before, so I was giving the director credit for a bit more intentional surrealism than he intended.

Babadook, on the other hand, I think, leans more toward “its all in the head of a couple of codependent people with mental illness.”",8pg2ma

The movie, though didn't explicitly say how long the grandmother had dementia for, but it did say that she had it for a long time. This dementia was abnormal though. She was able to make ""new"" friends, but wasn't able to connect with Annie anymore. Remember at the end of the movie, how Peter has an almost innocent face, like he's a total new person?

BUT another really interesting theory some on the thread have posed is how different Charlie sounded when she was being channeled through Annie in the seance scene.

e5isyvi,"I'm... not sure. Peter was supposed to be the original host, but Annie makes it clear that she kept Peter away from the grandmother. Then we see the grandmother be way too close to Charlie as a child and that allowed Paimon to grow into that body, even though it wasn't the appropriate body (Paimon needs a male). 

As we see with his mom, breaking a person mentally was required for the blue light (Paimon) to assume direct control. And I think that Peter dying allowed Paimon full control, without having to share the body like he did with real Charlie.

Although, that moment of real Charlie might have been a brilliant piece of mind games that Paimon was playing and Charlie just never actually existed because Paimon absorbed her being when he used her as a host body.

I do believe though that she was always there, preventing Paimon from having complete control over the body. I think.

Edit: From Mashable

#[CHARLIE HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN CHARLIE](https://mashable.com/2018/06/14/hereditary-ending-explained-everything-you-missed/#HT1ZbjM1Uaq7)

>From the moment we meet her, it's obvious there's something off about Charlie. What exactly that is takes a while to reveal itself.

>Early in the film, Annie (Toni Collette) explains that when her son Peter was born, she kept him away from her mother, Ellen. When her daughter Charlie was born, though, Annie relented and ""gave"" her to Ellen. Ellen doted on Charlie, insisting on breastfeeding the baby girl herself, even as she made it clear she wished Charlie had been a boy – because, we later discover, Paimon prefers a male host. 

>Nevertheless, Charlie's body proved good enough until the cult could transfer Paimon to Peter's body. Speaking to Variety, Aster confirmed that not only is Charlie ""the first successful host for Paimon,"" but that Paimon was inside Charlie ""from the moment she's born.""

>""I mean, there’s a girl that was displaced, but she was displaced from the very beginning,"" he added. All along, the girl everyone (including us) knew as Charlie was just a vessel for Paimon.",8pg2ma
e4vpqp7,"I think that Ellen Leigh (Grandma) was like a wife and caretaker to Paimon until her death, but as a supplicant she was never meant to be fully possessed by him.  We saw pictures of her in what looked like a wedding veil surrounded by happy fellow cultist celebrants and she was tossing gold coins into the air.  I think it was a ceremony to bond Grandma and Paimon in preparation for Charlie and Peter being ""of age"".  

If we keep in line with the decapitation to posses theory that seems to fit, then it would make sense that Grandma couldn't pass Paimon along to either grandchild until her own death.  Also as someone else pointed out earlier, Paimon couldn't be expected to live in a child's form for years to await their maturity. 

I don't think Paimon was meant to wait that long either.  Remember when Mom is at the grief counseling meeting and she talks about her family history?  Her brother literally killed himself because he thought his mom (sweet old Grandma Ellen) was trying to ""put people inside him"".  Everyone chalked it up to schizophrenia, but he knew what was really up years ago!  With her only son dead, Ellen (Grandma) had to wait for that grandson to be born.  But Toni Collette wouldn't let her anywhere near Peter.  Charlie became the next intended temporary host, albeit fully possessed, at that point. ",8pg2ma

e1xp9cz,"Annie’s father? Hmmm, I don’t recall his name ever being mentioned? But that could be a possibility. I think the fact that it was specifically placed next to Peter’s mat was to show the extent to which Ellen treated Charlie like a boy, hence “Charles.”",8pg2ma
e0bpym7,"My thoughts are that Charlie knew about decapitation as part of the ritual. She was offering this bird for the grandma or like someone else said a cult member.

Towards the end I think in one of the books you find out that Paimon is supposed to inhabit a male body... If you remember during the grief session, Annie drops that she kept Peter and herself separated from her mother, but chose to let her mother close to Charlie... So I think Charlie was the Grandmas last ditch effort to get the Paimon plan going. Even Charlie was aware that the Grandma wanted her to be a boy.

The grandmother lived with the family, so she might have written them. Maybe more likely is that Paimon wrote them through Charlie.

The play referenced at the beginning of the movie was a Greek drama (if I recollect correctly). In Greek tragedy, the gods can play the characters like puppets because they know what buttons to push to get certain reactions. The characters are powerless to change because they are slaves to their nature—that’s what a nature is, it cannot be changed.  It’s like they’re pawns in a machine of destiny, thrust headlong onto a path they can’t get off.  If only they could get a “bird’s eye view” of the whole situation, develop some self awareness about their nature, maybe there would be a different outcome.

Annie was being played from the moment she was born. Her mother tried possessing Annie’s brother with Paimon. Her brother killed himself, because his mom was “putting people in him.”  Then she tried getting Peter possessed, but Annie protected him. But she gave her daughter to her mom. Annie went to the therapy group because she had been before with her mom.  But she is the only one who stands up and tries to do something about the situation.

If you notice, she tells her husband she’s going to the movies when she’s really going to therapy.  She tells him she can’t sleep when she really is going to sleep in the treehouse.  Her husband lies to her about the phone call from the cemetery. Her son lies to her about drinking.  They are all responsible in some ways, but she’s the sole character who takes agency and seeks out the truth of what’s going on before it’s too late.  That’s also why she’s obsessed with those figurines because she wants some agency over her life, and the art is her way of controlling the random, fucked up shit that happens to her.

The scenes were she’s begging her husband and Peter to cooperate made my heart sink.  When she said during therapy she didn’t think she could get the support she needed from them, I got a lump in my throat.  The poor woman seemed so desperate to make her family work, but she couldn’t get anyone to cooperate with or listen to her.  It’s like she’s damned either way.

And the image of her cutting off her own head with a piano wire seemed more tragic than scary.  The whole film felt like a metaphor for the destructive power of grief in a family that doesn’t talk to each other, and because of that, can’t support each other.",8pg2ma

It was so tense that anything he said would have been disagreed with and yes, by the end he had checked out because everyone had lost it. I really don’t see how he’s even close to being a “bad guy”.

e0f90tu,"I would say the beheading was 100% orchestrated.  I think Ellen's death was the inciting incident of the movie, as it led to Joan becoming the new leader of the cult and her approach to summon Paimon was more aggressive.  I think the nut allergy is Paimon exercising control over Charlie, which is somewhat limited due to Charlie being a non-ideal host.  I think the party was organized to lure Peter by cultists.  My main piece of evidence for this is when Peter walks upstairs to smoke the girls in that room are watching a video with a guillotine on the laptop.  From there, the cult would know the route to the hospital and give Paimon the perfect opportunity to take control of Charlie, behead her, and set into motion a series of events to summon him again and put him in Peter's body.",8pg2ma

Maybe you could see it in a position where you can take breaks, go on your phone, ect when it gets too intense to bear.

e0eibg4,"I believe Paimon didn't have a host after Charlie died, that's why Joan gets Annie to perform the ""seance"" to ""contact Charlie"" when she is in fact not contacting Charlie at all but inviting Paimon into her body.  She then releases Paimon from her body when she cuts her own head off in the attic and Paimon enters Peter after he jumps from the window.  ",8pg2ma
e0ef1ub,"Same here, they certainly left a lot of great details and hints!

They didn't go into any details of an opposing force to Paimon, some Christian angel/spirit (I'm glad!) so I'd chalk it up to some motherly or natural instinct to burn evil.

And I would agree that he starved himself from the ""depression"" which might have been brought on by possession of a weak host.  I want to listen again to her grief counseling and see if she lists them chronologically as the order of men she tried to pass Paimon to before waiting for her daughter to produce more.",8pg2ma

e4prpan,"well considering we're dealing w/ such supernatural other-worldly elements as demonic possession by Hell kings as well as flying/levitating bodies, among other things, I doubt it matters much to the story whether or not the cultists had somewhere to piss. 

edit: just to clarify tho, from whose perspective is the story being told? if this is about mental illness / trauma, that should mean that everything we're seeing is actually hallucination/distortion -- if this is the case, it should stand to reason that the distortions are not shared among family members but only happening to one of them. Person A thru C should be seeing Version 1 of reality, whereas Person D is seeing Version 2. 

Who is Person D in this case?

edit 2: because the supernatural elements seem to be occurring *for sure* to both the son and the mom, in their own individual worlds, whether they're alone or together, that would make me think that these events are occurring in reality as opposed to hallucination.",8pg2ma
e694b6p,"I agree. Once we know Joan is the big bad we have to look at everything she's done before that is revealed with fresh eyes.

They also make a point of saying that the grandmother was estranged from the family for a while before the dementia hit her; maybe she just didn't have access to Peter for a while and then favoured Charlie when she was able to be around the kids at all.

It's true, we don't really know that, but it  seems functionally really difficult. All in 1 night while sleepwalking Annie would have to dig up the grave, get the body out of its casket, get the body into the house and into the attic, then clean herself and her trail up, all without waking anyone up. Like I guess it could be done, but it seems messy and dumb when the cult could just get minions to do it. 

>Finally, aren't we led to believe that Charlie was always Paimon? This is the part that confuses me most. Does Charlie know she is Paimon? What is the significance of her sweet tooth?

I also think Charlie was always Paimon, but I don't think she knew it. Even though she was creepy and sullen, she still pretty much behaved like a child. I'd imagine Paimon would have that smug face Peter has when he looks at himself before banging his head into the  
desk. There are instances I think we see the true Charlie, such as when the teacher catches her doing something (can't remember if drawing) instead of her quiz. Also when she briefly possesses Annie and is confused about everything, we see she probably wasn't actually evil as /just/ Charlie. Not sure about the sweet tooth. ",8pg2ma
e0ohl8x,">I thought that throughout the movie you don't know what Annie is up to with all the sleep walking and such. I agree that the cult probably exhumed Annie's mom, but do we really know that?

This movie doesn't spell anything out for you purposely, but the husband only suspected her because he had no idea she was going to grief counseling. I think the most likely scenario is the cult. 

>Also, I thought that Peter did die from the fall. It seemed to me that while he's laying there, motionless, you see a shadow move away from his body (I assumed this was his soul), and that light move into his body (I assumed this was Paimon).

He could have been. I don't think it matters at that point was what I was saying. He's gone regardless.

>Finally, aren't we led to believe that Charlie was always Paimon? This is the part that confuses me most. Does Charlie know she is Paimon? What is the significance of her sweet tooth?

Yes. and the director said in an interview she was basically Paimon from the second the grandmother got her claws in her. That Charlie is technically in there, but they've essentially been raising Paimon. I'm pretty sure the sweet tooth thing was foreshadowing the fact that Pete knew she loved chocolate so he had her go eat cake so he could smoke with the girl he had a crush on.

e0vf3sw,Also remember the scene where Joan is across the street from Peter’s school and screams out to him “Peter!

e0uz3fe,"This raised an interesting thought. What if the magic and ritual is real but there is no Paimon, so it's all for nothing?",8pg2ma
e0uvh8o,"I think that the whole point was to rebirth Paimon into the world, and Charlie WAS Paimon. Much in the same way that Damian in the Omen is the Devil's son, and not just some possessed child. I am guessing that the Grandmother had to perform some ritual during pregnancy that ensured the fetus would be born simply as the soul of Paimon, and she probably hoped it would be a male shell that his soul inhabited. She may have even tried doing it during the pregnancy with Peter, and the attempts to end the pregnancy may have killed/forced Paimon's soul out of the fetus. 

I kind of thought of it as almost being like reincarnation, and that Paimon was, in essence,  just a thirteen year old child who had only known his life as none other than Charlie. Charlie never fit in because, from birth, she was never of this world.

At one point it's mentioned that Paimon could only enter a weakened host, so I imagine terrifying an already traumatized teenager would be a prime target. He has a small amount of strength and resolve left when he whispers ""it's just a dream, wake up"" to himself over and over, but that's destroyed when he sees his mother begin to decapitate herself with piano wire.

She sent Charlie to the party because she couldn't handle 'mothering' her when she was being rejecting and difficult. She's wrestling with these in the back of her mind all the time. It also makes parents in the audience uncomfortable, because it doesn't get talked about, but most of us have had fleeting thoughts of 'why the hell did I decide to become a parent' when things are at their hardest, and so we can share a bit of that guilt.

So the beheading is very consistent with the way Paimon is realized in the real world. 

I think that Paimon enters the household during the seance, through the weakest member - which happens to be Annie due to her tragic emotional state.

The family history states that the grandmother's son took his own life, I am guessing before they could finish whatever spell was needed to grant possession.  Ah, that's why it's called Hereditary.  It was crucial because the bloodline was significant.  Paimon had to have a vessel from the grandmother's bloodline.  I recall the mother of the children saying she was more protective of the boy, but when the daughter was born she gave her to the grandmother who then got her hooks into the the little girl.  Notice how Paimon got his three sacrificial heads from the three generations of women.  Makes sense why their headless bodies are bowing to the alter.

e5hcn0r,"I think when Paimon is locked ritually into a mortal form he forgets who he is until the cult does an awakening ritual.  Similar to the idea that if we are reincarnated we don't remember our past lives until after we die and become spirits. 

Charlie was strange and different, she didn't fit in and clung to her grandmother. She knew she was different and perhaps had psychic feelings of dread. Her grandmother made that comment,""you were supposed to be a boy"", but never told her who she really was. I think the grandmother told her that because she knew that someday Paimon would remember everything.  In the book that Annie found it said Paimon could become livid and vengeful if offered a female host and that it was imperative to remember that he is covetous of a male body because he is a male.

The cult needed to get him out of Charlie and into Peter.  They began the ritual to release him from Charlie and she was killed.  Then he was freed as a spirit and he knew everything and used his supernatural powers to terrorize Peter and Annie to make them vulnerable to his possession.  He set Steve on fire, knowing Annie thought she would be the one to go up in flames. Shocked into a vulnerable state, he possessed her to use as a puppet and terrify Peter. He also terrorized Peter at school.  At the seance he possessed Annie and imitated Charlie sounding frightened and helpless to further devastate Peter.

Once Peter jumped from the window, Paimon could finally permanently possess him. The ritual was complete and the cult locked him into Peter's mortal body.  He then forgot and only remembers his last mortal form of Charlie.  The movie ended there, but we know the cult will restore his memories. They want his gifts of riches, knowledge, etc.

I had all the same questions you did, the unfolding of events and Paimon's action/inaction didn't make sense to me.
Over time it became more clear.  I've watched it over 5 times, I've lost count.  Great movie!  And I apologize for such a long post.

One last thought, I believe Ellen, the grandmother, used her blood in the summoning and binding ritual. Just my theory. That's why Paimon could only successfully possess someone in her direct bloodline.

Well yeah, he was dead (or all but). That's a pretty vulnerable state. The spirit was supposedly only passed into Charlie through the grandmother breastfeeding her. So it seems Paimon can inhabit a dead body, or can be passed from live person to live person through an intimate connection (but I theorize that the person on the receiving end would still need to be in a truly vulnerable mental state...like a newborn baby). 

>Why do we see the death cult's logo on the pole that kills Charlie, then? If that's not meant to implicate the cult in her death, it makes absolutely no sense to put that in the movie, especially since the audience has no idea what it means the first time they see it.

Another commenter theorized that the sigil on the pole may have been a ""draw"" to Paimon's spirit, thus what drew Charlie to lean out the car window. But to your point, if the cult has so much influence they can literally make a stranger put nuts in a cake, and can control all of Peter's choices and movements, there's no point in engineering such a complex death. They could have just had Peter run over Charlie in the driveway if they have all that power. So I guess the short answer is they were trying to influence it to happen, but don't have the power to engineer it down to the smallest detail like that.

>At no point does the movie indicate that the dad is even remotely involved in the scheme. We even see him drafting an email expressing concern about his wife's mental decline. He's the only sane and good character in the movie, and as such is vital as an anchor for the audience.

Okay, I can agree with you there. I thought it was strange that the burning effect ""transferred"" so to speak, and didn't think it totally implausible that Steve was briefly possessed. But I guess his burning was just Paimon using a final move to push Annie over the brink.

Also, Peter is unaware of the cult at the end of the film when he wakes up. There is a lot of evidence that the film unfolds literally. I think the hereditary nature of mental illness serves as both an effective red herring for the audience and a metaphor that the film pushes. Not only for mental illness, but about how our behavior effects our children and the generations that follow. In the film's actual events, though, it's heavily implied that there was never any mental illness in the family at all. Annie's brother didn't kill himself at 16 due to early onset schizophrenia - his mother was really trying to ""put people inside him"" and his dad starving himself seems suspect as well.

> It's not clear that we're actually hearing Charlie. Could just be the son and mom hallucinating her voice, while the dad could simply be hearing his wife speak words in her own normal voice.

I'm like 90% sure I heard Charlie's voice mixed in with Annie's voice during that scene. If it was just Peter and Annie in the seance, I would more readily believe it was just a joint hallucination. But how I saw it was that Steve did hear Charlie's voice in that scene and that we the audience weren't seeing it from either Steve or Peter's perspective but from a third person omniscient POV. It would have been clearer if Steve had a line or two questioning what he just witnessed.

Yeah, the cup thing can be explained with the ouija board trick but those other details seemed less explainable and more supernatural.

I'm still of the belief that it was both mental and supernatural causes that led to what happened in the movie. 

However, I think there's a detail that could help your claim. IIRC, I don't think Joan ever interacted with any characters in the movie besides Annie and Peter.

I do think you can make the beheadings fit into the mental illness theme if you like, though Paimon’s connection to wealth doesn’t really connect to the themes of the movie either.

She built statues of Paimon and cut heads off of birds because Paimon controlled her.

The issues you mention having with the movie I just didn’t feel. And Hereditary is referring the the demon, not mental illness. How you feel about that is a different more understandable discussion, but it’s unfair to say it doesn’t stick to the hereditary theme.

It's not clear if Paimon is an ultimate master manipulator and everything that happens is carefully orchestrated, and created just like Annie's intricate craftsmanship? If so why did Paimon not easily posses Annie's brother as the demon's host. 

Why did burning the book automatically torch Steve? That made zero sense to me.

Why did Charlie need to assume Peter for Paimon to take over. Why not just cut out Charlie and just go straight for Peter.

The movie might have some interesting takes on the theme of loss, but anything themes this movie tries to expand upon are promptly shat upon towards the end, and you're left feeling cold, confused, and just a little less bored when the cultists finally make an attempt to explain to the audience what the fuck was going on the last 30 minutes and start shouting *""HAIL PAIMON""*",8pg2ma

Mental illness plays a role in it, but to suggest that it's all imaginary is stupid when he's told you it isn't imaginary.

The Babadook is about way more than that too. It's a story of grief and depression over the loss of her husband, that is why the Babadook takes the form of her husband. It's about not dealing with her loss and also blaming her son for it. The single mother to a misbehaving child aspect of it is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle. 

But while the Babadook does leave some room for interpretation at the end, with the creator never really confirming or denying a whole lot of stuff in interviews, Hereditary really doesn't have that same room. The creator has been straightforward and talked openly about design choices and plot points. He's confirmed the existence of  Joan, the other Cult members and Paimon in interviews, which completely shoots down the theory of them being imaginary.

I'll even go as far to say that the shooting style was purposely done to make it feel as though you were watching dolls in a house. A lot of the horror in that film for me came from not necessarily knowing what's going on and having to simply observe what I could like a fly on the wall.

2). Annie is standing below the treehouse clutching the photo album waiting for her husband to get home.  We can see behind her that there is a dirt bed at the end of the drive.  Less than 12 hours later Peter jumps from the attic into a now fully bloomed flower bed where the dirt bed was.",8pg2ma

This guy’s just seeing red string where there is none. The movie is inherently mysterious, but reading TOO much into it not only doesn’t make sense but goes against the spirit the filmmakers wanted to capture:  an unsolvable question of predetermination vs free will, magic vs disease, real vs imaginary.

I was watching it through different eyes.

I’m not sure that Hereditary is quite the weight class as Requiem is. Hereditary is like a niche horror film that has very powerful elements, but Requiem was kind of a groundbreaking drama film unique in both visual style and narrative style.

It is an interesting movie to compare it to, though, however you’d probably be better off comparing it to something contemporary like The Conjuring, The Witch (VVitch), It Follows, and House of the Devil. I thought it was also in line with some of the older films like The Wicker Man, Rosemary’s Baby, Shapiro’s, or even The Omen. I think that’s closer to what they were going for. In fact, on IMDb under trivia it’s noted that “Ari Aster [the writer/director] was heavily influenced by the film The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover (1989).” Though if you noticed some similarities to Requiem for a Dream, you might not be wrong, as he probably has seen the movie and was impressed by it as anyone who saw it was.",8pg2ma

Then, as the occult undertones start to become more and more apparent, I was blown away. Some of those scenes have easily some the best horror cinematography I’ve ever seen. The naked cult members standing outside in blink-or-you’ll-miss that quick shot of the house, the mom sawing her head off, the grandma being showered in gold coins by the cultists, the headless mom floating. 

Imagery aside, just the idea of the whole first half of the movie being a completely different thing entirely when you put the occult stuff and early hints together is so goddamn unsettling.

This is one of the most self-evident characteristics of effective storytelling. I'm not sure if you meant to say ""why should I care about the characters in *this* story. Either way, my original suggestion still holds. This film relies on the viewer to become emotionally involved with the family.

This is why it spends the first half creating a relatable dynamic (relatable to most, anyway). It doesn't simply use mental illness as a crutch. Instead the emotional force is driven by the characters own coping with loss and then tragedy. Those scenes are carried by both the incredible acting but also by the subtle design of the emotional exchanges (a reluctant mother explaining her history with her mother - all in one slowly zoomed shot, a quiet dinner table scene, n compassionate stranger who waves down Annie and relate her own loss). If the editing or lighting or camera angle or set design are off, that can deflate any great actress's performance. The Room is a perfect example of those technical failures. But those elements were on point in Hereditary.

If I'm egotistical for wondering how those features didn't resonate with someone who went into the movie with a good faith effort to relate to what the movie had to offer, then I'm guilty. But apparently you were annoyed from the get go by the mere presence of a ""special needs girl"" that made you feel uncomfortable because she was so ""awkward."" The way you talk about people with unconventional personalities and the flippant way you refer to mental illness is rather revealing. But it says more about you than about the film. Sue me.",8pg2ma

So people that have had a parent with a mental illness can't have kids or else they are cunt people? You are a very judgmental person.

There was some laughter in the theater when we went during a couple of scenes where laughter didn't seem appropriate, but I chalked it up to the half-drunk after dinner young adult crowd that we normally avoid by going earlier. It might just be an age thing. For example, the Exorcist traumatized me when I was little (yes, my parents let me watch it when I was 9 for some reason) but my own kids tell me it isn't scary at all.

Part of what makes her so enthralling, and lets be honest kind of creepy, is her appearance. She could have cleidocranial dysplasia, and while I think visibility in media for all different types of people is VERY important, it felt a tad exploitative...Clearly the director leaned on her having unusual features to make things feel unsettling. I mean forgetting that for a moment, having a child’s decomposing severed head is exploitative enough, it takes gore porn to another level that I could see as problematic. BUT when you say the movie title of course that’s the part you think of. It reminded me of Georgie getting his arm ripped off in IT, or children being murdered in Kill List and A Serbian Film.

e1nqc13,"Awesome--I totally understand.  Thank you for responding!

I'm sympathetic, as I felt in a sense like that the first time too in a way. I can only relay from my point of view.

I was super excited about this film and really obsessively watched the trailers for weeks.  
I saw it the first time, liked it but was frankly underwhelmed.   Then I went home and thought about it for a few days.  I realized that there are a lot of things in the story didn't add up.  I went back, started watching again and realized that there is a potentially deeper story here than what meets the eye.  Yes I know that there is an ""official"" explained ending by the director but even that doesn't add up--my guess is that this was given so as not to get an angry rebuttal from someone who has one of the illnesses alluded to in the film because if you look at it from the facts of the film it's a very deep film with many details.  I am close to someone who has symptoms of one of the illnesses alluded to/mentioned in the film, and of course I don't think this person is going to saw their head off or try to kill me.  But I saw even after the AMA that someone was complaining about the purported negative portrayal of mental illness--but I don't see this film that way at all.  If anything, it's positive.  The warped time, for example, as portrayed by the massively messed up clocks and calendars in the film seems to be how this person close to me perceives time.  You can say, hey, I'm traveling to Idaho tomorrow, walk out of the room and walk back in and they say did you go to Idaho yet and it is a sincere question.  It's wild.  I'm so grateful for this film and excited for how deep it is.  I hope others can see it, too, maybe when it goes to blu-ray etc.  As a type of artist myself I believe that that an artist's work needs to stand on it's own, no explanation needed for the audience, but I also understand the business aspect as well.  I love it and have seen it maybe even in the double digits for the number of times.  I see something new each time.

e0knlgt,"I feel like you might be getting caught up in the concept of predeterminism as an act of divinity, when I think u/hinkil was referring to the grandmother and cult members manipulating circumstances in order to achieve specific goals, in this case the goal of finding a host for Paimon. In the context of this movie predetermination doesn't mean, ""there are no narrative rules because God predetermined everything,"" it just means that certain characters previously manipulated people and circumstances, thus predetermining future events.

Specifically regarding the car accident, there are several clues that lead me to believe Charlie's death was ""predetermined"":

1. The biggest clue is the sign of Paimon on the lamppost that decapitated Charlie. The cult could have put the sign there after her death, but it's more likely that they put it there prior to her death to compel her to stick her head out of the window in the first place.
2. The dead animal on the road is another clue. Large roadkill is not abnormal for a country road, but that, paired with the sign of Paimon on the nearest lamppost to the dead animal strengthens my hypothesis that the cult concocted that whole sequence of events.
3. It's also very clear due to the amount of other decapitations that take place in the film, that decapitation was significant to the cult. This further supports the idea that they created the circumstances leading to Charlie's death by decapitation.
4. Someone else pointed out how weird it is that, despite the mom *clearly* knowing that there will be alcohol at what she also *clearly* knows is not an innocent barbecue, and despite the fact that Charlie doesn't even want to go, she insists that Peter take Charlie to the party. We find out later that the cult was putting spells on Peter, so it's not a stretch to think they would have been doing that to Annie as well in different ways.

e0bvf3i,"First, Peter’s reaction after the accident is masterful acting. He is in absolute shock and disbelief. He is also high as fuck. He catches his breath and drives home (calling forward to later scene in the attic when he tries to wake himself up). He gets home and goes to bed clothed. He never looks back. He doesn’t want to even believe what could have happened, but he knows it did. In regards to Charlie’s body, the decapitated body is in the car and the head was at the side of the road. My assumption is that the cult members picked up the head after the accident as it’s later in the tree house shrine. They orchestrated the accident (symbol on the pole, perhaps conjuring or placing something in the road) and so were ready. 

Regarding the body in the car, Charlie’s head was decapitated. That would mean copious blood loss from the severed carotid arteries. The body and back of car would be covered in blood. When blood dries it turns black - like tar. That’s what she meant (not actual tar).

In regards to the aftermath, it was an accident. The writers didn’t feel the need to show a police investigation as there wasn’t an inquiry. They also just brought Peter home from the school, not to the hospital. I think this is just reinforcing the isolated, insular nature of the family and they are cut off. Isolated house in woods. Isolated party in back country.

In regards to kids when Peter has panic attack. These are stoner teenagers. Boys that age don’t have healing circles. They joke about girls and sex all the time. I saw this as a very authentic situation in even the face of his recent grief. Also, again, the family is very cut off and secretive and isolated. I don’t think much of the community knows about them or their family.

The mom makes Charlie go to the party. Bad decision, but it sets up the blame game between the son and the mother. Who is to blame for the death? Peter for not watching out, for getting high, for not calling 9-1-1 or the mother for making a 13 year old go to a teenage party she absolutely didn’t want to go to. It’s a critical plot point given the Mother’s ongoing anxiety about blame and persecution from her mother and Peter when she almost set him on fire while sleep walking. 

As for a cake. Kids have cakes at parties. And you can put crushed nuts on top of a cake. I really don’t see anything wrong with this at all. No cake at a party? Maybe it was someone’s birthday. That’s a silly thing to be worried about. Peter was interested in the girl, that’s why he wanted to be there. He was neglectful and mad Charlie was there. He’s not looking for nuts everywhere. Also, Charlie is clearly portrayed to have some sort of mental illness or developmental disability (I’m assuming autism given that the mother references that she never cried as a baby). I don’t think she appreciates the nut concern and her brother just insisted she get cake. 

So altogether, I don’t really think you have highlighted any plot holes that need explanation from “grandma magic”, but rather have just highlighted your elementary ability to understand plot devices or social norms. I’m not trying to be mean, but if you’re having a hard time following the plot of this very well crafted movie, then I’m not sure you have any business being a self-proclaimed “horror movie critic”, especially considering that you can’t even articulate your critiques well.

She alluded to her mom's ""secret rituals and secret friends"", and knew something was up, but consciously didn't know what it was.

I also wonder that if when her mother died that the presence of whatever was in her took a bit of hold over her and that it might've not been even really ""her"" that wanted Charlie to go to that party, but this entity her mother and her coven were trying to summon into human form.  Charlie was the temporary vessel that the grandmother was able to summon this demon into, but Charlie wasn't the ideal male host for it.

I wish we’d got a foam one or something that wasn’t that thick.” There was a hardness under it so I was just slamming my face against that thing. But, you know, you’ve gotta do it.

That’s how I saw hereditary I hadn’t even seen a trailer. My buddy just said it’s about “some ugly little girl” lol.

e0j5oqn,"For what its worth my partner and I loved “It comes at night” as we have loved all the A24 films. We spent hours pouring over it in slow frame by frame afterwards, it really gets its hooks into you if you are a person who is drawn in by the intrigue of what is left unsaid then i think you will enjoy it. Otherwise perhaps not. 


I’ll use spoiler tags so that you can choose to read this next part or not at your pleasure, I don’t consider it any real spoiler personally but I will defend your right to go in blind to the death.

There are a couple of shots in the film that have an extremely quick and subtle hidden element in them.

[1. I think most people have noticed this according to the discussion thread but you could definitely miss it if not watching closely. Near the start of the film when Paul is driving through the forest there is a moment where the angle of the shot changes a bit changing from being more 45 degrees to become more 90 degrees, side on with Paul in drivers set, the effect is that the driver’s side window in now neatly framed in a way that it was not previously and at the same time the depth of field increases to bring the forest visible through that window more into focus. This shot does not last long, just long enough to show you(if you are watching closely and quite far into the forest, a clearing... and what looks like some giant figure sitting there. It passes so fast and the first time I wrote it off as just being a huge tree stump but on the second viewing I became convinced it was a figure. Sometimes I swear it looks like it moves, but it is so far off and so quick it’s impossible to tell. It may very well be that it is just a giant creepy stump that is intended to look like a monster but either way the director wanted you to see it, the camera moves and the depth of focus changes just so that you can see it.We went through it frame by frame so many times just trying to figure out the mystery lmao. ] (/s)

[2.	Later, probably around the middle of the film if i recall correctly there is a scene where the dog gets agitated and runs off into the woods as if chasing something , and if you are like me then your eyes will naturally follow the dog off into the woods and search far into the depths for some sign of any person or any thing, but what you want to look out for here isn’t out there far off in the woods... my partner and I didn’t see this until maybe the second or third watch but if you watch I think the very closest tree right in center frame there is a persons shoulder just visible for a second behind the right side of the tree and then in vanishes back behind the tree.] (/s)

e1fgdib,"Yeah I think about it a lot. It's gonna be hard. I think for me, the lessons I learned from my failure of a childhood is that while being a helicopter parent is bad, being a neglectful parent is bad too. So I can't be too overbearing or too distant. I think it's important that kids make mistakes but know that their parents are nearby to help. 

I think it's also important to let kids experience their emotions so they know how to communicate and express. Like you can't praise a kid for being quiet and 'wellbehaved' or peaceful, or they'll stunt themselves thinking it's the ideal and avoid acting out for fear. I feel like i spent the first 21 years as a toddler, the three after as a child, and I just hit teenager last year. You praise a kid for being smart, they'll think they have to be smart and avoid failure, take the low hanging fruit.

And I think if your kid is having a tantrum, instead of smacking them and telling them to be quiet and behave, you should let them let it all out and then ask them why they were upset, tell them it's okay now, it's over and the next time they know it's gonna be okay because they're okay now. Tbh I think tantrums are the culmination of frustration of a failure to communicate so it erupts at once

e0re4nt,"The grandmother was the original possessor of Paimon; she wanted to pass him into Peter, but Annie states her relationship with her mother was very rocky. The two of them were not speaking when Annie had Peter, and Annie refused to allow Peter into her life.

When Annie had Charlie, the grandmother was more present in her life. She was overpowering with Charlie and molded her development heavily, including breastfeeding Charlie instead of letting Annie. Annie explains all of this to her grief counseling group.

Since before the film's start, Charlie has been possessed by Paimon. However, because Charlie is female, Paimon apparently isn't as strong as he should be. There's some text in the Grandma's possessions stating that Paimon is ""supposed"" to be a young, healthy male. Peter was always the ""intended"" host, but Annie kept Peter away from her mother.

Thus, the cult uses its' ""witchcraft,"" I guess, to orchestrate the death of Charlie, and then break Peter down until he's weak enough to be possessed by Paimon.

I don't have all the answers, but the demonic possession is linked to this particular family. Hence the title, *Hereditary.*",8pg2ma
e2m2blt,"This is a month late but I'm reading through the thread now that I've watched the movie and I can answer this based on Paimon's historical significance. 

So back in the day, a good chunk of the demons (remember Paimon is the 9th), were female. This was changed later when the role of women in society shifted and the patriarchy took form. Essentially all the demons were rewritten as being male, I'm not 100% sure why, but that's why I'm basing it on the societal shift back then. In order to maintain the lore, Paimon's history was changed to that of a female that needs to transform into a male. 

That's briefly acknowledged on the page Annie stops on in that spirituality book. 

So the movie adapts that to Paimon requiring a female host, before being transferred to a male host, signifying the transformation from female to male. ",8pg2ma

He literally burst Steve into flames.  Possessed Annie, levitating her body to saw her own head off.  I think you may be underestimating the extent of a demon god's powers.

There's a well known, but not fully understood, correlation between using marijuana and schizophrenia. I don't know if that's too much of a stretch, and I don't think the movie suggests that's what caused him to have a breakdown, but it fits in the larger pattern within the story of behaviors/experiences that can lead toward developing mental health issues. Like, it would be a relevant behavior for someone who is genetically predisposed to having a disorder like schizophrenia.

There’s no reason a 13 year old can’t look out for her own allergy so he must have made her(?) eat the cake. In an earlier scene she was eating peanut M&Ms as well. Also, the pole that decapitated her had the cult’s symbol inscribed on it.

She desperately wanted Annie to have a baby, thats why she forced her to keep it and it's why we see the Doll of her mother watching over her and her husband having sex at the start. I think that Paimon was put inside Charlie after birth as a last resort due to Annie distancing peter from her mother for so long, and that is why she grew up very strange.

He let Annie believe she was the only one who was bound to the book, but she brought the whole family into it during Charlie's ""sceance"" (as per Joane's instructions), so Paimon could have burned any one of them.

It can work, but for the movie that *Hereditary* was, it would've just felt like a cheap, unsubtle wink like, ""Eh? Eh? See? It's not real!""

Again, this is just my own perspective. While I find mental illness to be a real, and very scary subject, I think that as a plot device, it works best when we don't expect it. Like in *Shutter Island* or *Fight Club*. I feel that in order for that kind of turn to happen, it does have to be a significant enough turn to get that sort of whiplash, ""WTF"" moment.

She wanted her daughter to be normal and that was paramount. She lost sight of any risk. Your previous comment was more focused on Charlie's reaction but for me, this was the result of the parents unraveling. Parents have left their kids in hot cars to die, completely unintentional. How could that happen? Wouldn't you be more careful? Also, in terms of the movie's theme, the symbol on the pole, it was gonna happen. If they had the epipen it would have been stolen or misplaced... Which I almost think would have worked better but oh well. ",8pg2ma
e0kz54b,"Actually, since they went to the funeral without the epipen, it's totally consistent that they didn't think about sending one with her to the party.

You aren't applying information we know to the scenes in the movie.

You can also say this about any movie ever, why didnt someone fill the car up with gas? Why didn't they just leave a house when weird stuff happened?

The writer, Ari, said that there was a real Charlie but she was displaced by Paimon when he entered her, probably as a fetus.

I don't think Peter had to die to become permanently possessed by Paimon.  I'm not sure even if that fall killed him. He did have to be very vulnerable and he wasn't weak enough for possession until the end.  

Based on what Ari said about Paimon displacing Charlie, I would think he also displaced Peter (if he was still alive) and pushed his soul/essence out when he possessed him.  But Ari has left some things vague so I think all theories are viable.

I suppose that the possibility is there and these beings could have co-opted Judeo-Christian lore to build a following, but there is no reason to believe that he is not in fact Paimon.

(1). The obituary says Ellen died at Annie's house but Annie tells the group therapy session that her mom died in hospice.
(2). Annie goes to her first group therapy session when it is completely dark outside, which for April 2018 in Salt Lake would have her arrive ~8:30-9:00 pm.  
(3). The location of Annie's group therapy is the same campus as Peter's school.
(4). When Charlie cuts the birds head, there are no cars rushing behind her but when she turns there is a busy road right by the school.
(5). It is unknown how Charlie's head was preserved from the time it was on the side of the road to the top of the statue in the treehouse.
(6). No one at school seems aware that Peter has suffered the loss of his sister.
(7). The diorama of the accident has a head in the road of a woman with gray hair, not a young girl.
(8). The ad on the seance shows up in the Graham's mail about two weeks after Ellen's death, but Joan tells Annie she hasn't seen her for a few months ( which would put the start time of the therapy session ~9:30 at night--it's dark outside then, too--for Salt Lake ).
(9). The treehouse has only three tree stumps for support, as the fourth is a tree still growing (we see this as Charlie walks down the hill towards the vision of Ellen).  Would not provide the structural support to hold several grown adults as in the final scene.

Well, the guy above you said that he interpreted the events as having only occurred in Annie and Peter's mind. Then you said you agreed with him. You guys are wrong.

- The main characters have all died by the end and we are left with an objective view of the events. 

- The shot inside Joan's apartment with the dolls and triangle is an objective shot as Annie can not see inside. 

- Annie is the only character that meets Joan and learns about Paimon, yet at the end when Annie has already died, Peter sees Joan who recites a prayer in praise of Paimon.

- The quick transition from day to night shows the exterior of the house surrounded by cult members in an objective shot. 

The final 30 minutes specifically lay out that this is all really happening. And the director confirmed that. So.....again, I don't see the confusion.

e2b13mg,"I finally saw it! Just got back from a screening, mostly empty theater. HOLY HELL, it was like sitting through a 2 hour long anxiety-attack... in the best way possible. 

I thought it was ominous, dreadful, horrific, original, nuanced... my mind is still racing hours later replaying certain scenes. I've been reading through this thread since I got home to look up people's interpretations of individual moments I didn't fully understand and am becoming more and more impressed by the fine detail and layers of symbolism.

My partner found it flat, boring, hated the protagonists... couldn't possibly have two more diametrically opposed reactions to a film. We usually have similar taste. He thought the acting, set design, cinematography were good but didn't find the story or their predicament to be compelling or intriguing. Basically, like with a bad slasher, he was just waiting for the 'unlikable characters' to get offed.

When hashing it out afterwards trying to pinpoint why our opinions differed so much, and why it was so terrifying to me, I wonder how much people's life experiences impact their perception and interpretation of a film like this. My perspective is colored by having experienced family members unraveling and becoming alienated from one another after a tragedy, family legacies of mental illness, growing up extremely Catholic and being indoctrinated from childhood with fears of the occult/Satan as an existential threat (even though I'm not a believer now). I think made it easier for me to identify with the family and the type of danger they were facing. My partner is from overseas, no judeochristian background and the most pleasant, well-adjusted family you can imagine - I think he really had trouble identifying with or finding anything familiar to grab onto or sympathize with this bunch of 'nuts'. That being said, I've also seen (multiple times) Rosemary's Baby, The Shining, House of the Devil, Don't Look Now, A Dark Song and a bunch of other satanic/family turmoil films that I saw direct parallels to and none of those are up his alley, so...

She says her brother killed himself because he thought their mom was trying to ""put people inside him"" (she was trying to implant Paimon in her son).

The only mental illnesses she says her mom had were DID and dementia, and I'm assuming the dementia came when she was elderly. DID is Dissociative Identity Disorder (aka Multiple Personality Disorder). I believe this was a misdiagnosis and that the grandmother had Paimon with her, hence multiple ""identities."" She may not have even been officially diagnosed too. Maybe she exhibited crazy behavior at home acting as mom and Paimon, so adult Annie just assumed her mom had DID growing up.

The movie really threw me through a loop for a few hours because I was totally sold on everything because a representation for mental illness, but now I think the mental illness angle was the big red herring/twist of the movie, because the surprise is they *aren't* crazy and that is IS all real.",8pg2ma

Anyway, I love ""lose their heads"" as a way to describe the process of unraveling in this movie. Putting it that way calls attention to the fact that the supernatural content and the theme of mental illness are NOT mutually exclusive but inextricably linked, don't you think? Others on this thread have posed those two elements as mutually exclusive, or in competition, such that only one or the other explains x or y scene or event or character. [This piece](https://www.refinery29.com/2018/06/201132/hereditary-movie-ending-explained-paimon-cult) praises the movie but says that the final sequence takes something away from its exploration of mental illness and grief, which can't be ""explained away"" by cultism. a.) Not so! and b.) it doesn't ""explain away"" anything, on the contrary it adds a profoundly disturbing aesthetic layer TO the theme of mental illness. In case it's not clear, I think this movie is fucking perfect.

So I knew there had to be some way to read all the decapitation as thematically relevant rather than ""only"" a flourish or an arbitrary aspect of Paimon's internal logic... just COULDN'T QUITE WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT (sry) (thx for your reading)

It’s literally the same thing as The Shining, the movie not the book. It’s a story about how an abuser affects the whole family, but uses the supernatural as a crutch. You can CHOOSE to see it differently. It’s a post-modernism approach to movies: it’s not the intent, but the affect it has on the audience that matters.

e0hzq0a,There’s a bit of debate on this...the dog or the deer...we need eyes on this...my first impression was it was the dog but then I’m sure the dog was killed (barking stops) inside the house ..killed by crazy Annie.  The carcass looks exactly like the one in the road...and it kind of makes a sick kind of sense the cult would drag it to outside the house as part of their ritual maybe...certainly Peter recognizes it and I’m thinking a realization that the car accident was planed all along is the knowing look we see (rather than him being gutted the pupper has died),8pg2ma
e0ianxf,"Maybe this level of chaos theory manipulation going down to the smallest detail is intended to show us how powerful the demon is and how doomed this whole family was from the start.

I’m not discounting it’s all a bit ridiculous ( we’re debating the theoretical power of an imaginary demon in a movie)... but we’ve seen all these tropes before (The Omen had elaborately engineered deaths made to look like accidents also, and they were similarly foreshadowed)",8pg2ma
e0i4xs7,"> The spirit was supposedly only passed into Charlie through the grandmother breastfeeding her. So it seems Paimon can inhabit a dead body, or can be passed from live person to live person through an intimate connection (but I theorize that the person on the receiving end would still need to be in a truly vulnerable mental state...like a newborn baby).

Maybe you hit on something re: a newborn baby also being in a vulnerable state, bc newborn babies definitely are. But again, Peter was in a vulnerable state pretty much throughout the movie, and it just feels really arbitrary to me that only at the very end is he vulnerable ""enough."" And also, if he wasn't inhabited by Paimon until the end, what was going on when he raised his hand in class and bashed his head against the desk?

> Another commenter theorized that the sigil on the pole may have been a ""draw"" to Paimon's spirit, thus what drew Charlie to lean out the car window.

That's *almost* a great explanation. But it ultimately doesn't work: We see the symbol on the pole *before* they get to the party and any of that stuff happens with the nuts. If it's meant to be a ""draw"" for Charlie, that implies that the cult, or Paimon, knew ahead of time that Charlie would eat the cake and go into anaphylactic shock, forcing Peter to speed home so quickly that he doesn't have time to stop for the dead animal in the road. And again, if they know all of that (or made all of that happen), why bother with the intricate long game?

Re: Steve's death, if Paimon can just cause anyone to catch fire at will, he wouldn't have had to go through all of the complex machinations that we see in the movie. ",8pg2ma

e0i2ui0,"Then why didn't Paimon inhabit his body 10 minutes earlier, before he fell onto the flower bed? Or a few weeks earlier, when he was already incredibly weak and unstable? If the idea is that he must be both physically and mentally unstable, why not just engineer the car crash so that he's physically injured as well? It just seems so incredibly specific that Paimon can only inhabit Peter's body at that particular moment, and that specificity seems to be there solely to justify the previous ~90 minutes of the movie. It feels contrived. ",8pg2ma

The horror of mental illness is that you really don't know what is real and the audience gets the experience that.

Regardless, I don't think seeing a tree house model in her room would make her more culpable. If anything it would just add to the ambiguity of whether the events were supernatural or hallucinated. But I do see your point.",8pg2ma

I interpret that as the director telling us that this story is going to be told completely through Annie's perspective.  I further think that her perspective is warped.  Spoilery continuation:  [Thus her interactions with Joan (who doesn't exist) and her revelations about her grandmother are all part of that delusion.  Notice during the seance that the husband never reacts to the crazy shit going on in the room, but instead to the affect the seance is having on their son.  In fact, the husband never experiences anything paranormal, right up to the point that he is immolated.  He finds the corpse but that is simple: Annie dug it up and brought it home.  Also note that Annie is holding the can of paint thinner at the time he goes up in flames.  Are we sure that he was set on fire diabolically, or is that just how Annie sees it?  Now, the trauma of killing his sister in a tragedy and of seeing his father burned to death in their home, at that point I theorize that Peter SNAPS.  He kills/decapitates his mother, brings the female family members of his family to the treehouse in a ritualistic fashion.  The hereditary problem in the family is mental disorder that is passed on, explaining why the Dad doesn't see the supernatural stuff.](#spoiler)  Of course the director rides the line so perfectly it could really be either way.

To me though, the golden statue at the end appeared to be made from found pieces of refuse, and one of those pieces of garbage had the symbol on. That made me think that the sigil was some sort of logo for a company, possible a company that had something to do with the utility pole. Some mental illnesses cause people to develop obsessions with certain symbols, so that would explain her painting the symbol in the attic.

e0grcds,"Exactly. I feel like the movie makes more sense as a headfuck kind of movie than as a cult possession movie, but it can be looked at either way. Are the hallucinations and craziness being caused by the demon, or is the ""demon"" being caused by the characters' mental instability?",8pg2ma

One, when she talks about how Peter ""always held it against her"" that she tried to light him and Charlie on fire, and two, when she made the diorama of the accident, and Steve very reasonably freaks out, and she says ""its from a neutral point of view, whats the problem?""

Holy shit, Annie is a *deeply* troubled person. I'm not sure that the movie really gets how interesting/flawed/fascinating she is. I would have greatly preferred a movie about how the family resolves its paranoid schizophrenia rather than the fate-adjusting black magic cult. 

I was totally prepared for Annie to be someone who would dig up her mom, cut of her head, not have any maternal feelings towards her son, be able to kill her husband, etc. I was 100% bought into that in a way I typically wasn't, and Hereditary just took the easier path, which explains nothing/everything.

If they were going for ""she is possessed and we don't know what is going on"", i would be fine. The visuals and sounds in this were carefully used to the plot not the experience in my opinion.

I get that they wanted to make her seem unstable, my gripe is that it was unnecessary and didn’t drive the plot at all. It set things up that were never followed through with. 

I know that she was possessed, the flying was just weird and a deviance from an otherwise grounded film. Also when that woman (who I thought was Annie but couldn’t have been cause Annie was beheaded) floated into the treehouse, the cgi was laughably bad.

We'll have to agree to disagree. Two 1960's TV shows, Thriller, with Boris Karloff, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents, were prime examples of the thriller genre. And some episodes of both included elements of the supernatural, with demons and possession. No gore though.",8pg2ma

e0musau,"It's not possible that she moves her workshop.  Look at the very first opening scene.  The POV is from her workshop, looking out onto the treehouse, and then panning around back to her miniature house, zooming in on Peter's room in the mini house, and then zooming in to the dad and dog waking up Peter.  The location of the workshop is located in the same space as Charlie's room, in a later shot.

This same room was established a few scenes earlier as the workshop for Annie.",8pg2ma

Some more random thoughts:    The fact that Annie's brother was named Charles...who had a likely horrible death and was a schizophrenic--is it really likely that a loving mother would name her daughter Charlie in this case?  No way-- it's not.  Charlie also looks like a doll to me, not real--but if she really is mentally disabled, and not well enough to function to remember to bring her epipen to the party then for sure her brother should be a king of hell for all eternity with mostly a bunch of older out of shape people rather than the gorgeous love of his life from school.  Maybe Peter was punishing himself.  I think both of the parents were lacking, with Steve a functional alcoholic and Annie obsessed with her craft.  Oh, one last one:  where exactly is Charlie's craft desk with all her dolls (and peanut mnm's) anyways?  It wasn't in her room in the house, and definitely was not in the treehouse.  The house ( and mini houses ) are characters themselves and hold the real clues to the story.

e19sewo,"Yeah I wouldn't say the individual scenes were poorly done, they were quite good... But they didn't connect well. The tension wasn't right. It wasn't psychological or suspense tension, it was horror tension. I felt like there was this set up to be a paranormal ghost story, but instead it was about half scenes revolving around Annie's mental health and the rest her family being traumatised. She was very obviously in need of help very early on, but nothing was done. 

Honestly after spending two hours with her I wanted to see what kind of place she ended up, if she could find a way to shake it off and protect her family. But instead she's just wiped out. I do understand why, and the flow of the plot, it just wasn't at all satisfying to me.

It's the talking and the mocking. Making the same *click* noise right after we hear it in the movie, every single time, effectively ruins the impact that has for everyone else in the theatre.

e0va5cr,Makes sense. ,8pg2ma
e0upecw,"Each to their own, I found the jump scares in AQP didn’t feel cheap at all. In Hereditary the tension felt cheap because it never led to a scare. 
The pregnancy was due to wanting to carry on as normal as possible I guess? And she wouldn’t get to the waterfall on time, and building close to a waterfall doesn’t seem feasible. I guess the main difference is the tension and scares felt natural, whereas in Hereditary, for me at least, there were far too few scares to market it as this terrifying horror film that rivals the Exorcist. It was more psychological and the plot felt super slow then a little rushed toward the end. I also kinda hate downer endings so that was another minus for me. ",8pg2ma
e0ui4vu,"Yeah I think the one thing I had a problem with in this movie is that they crammed too much information at the end.
No wait that's a lie, I also feel like the beginning could have been trimmed a bit and that some of the reaction scenes (like when Annie cries after Charlie's death) ohh that scene was too long  and her acting and wailing felt almost forced . I can only compare it to when a girl is doing porn and not into it so she just moans the same thing over and over again.
Like Annie's reaching and going back and then reaching and then going back and then finally she screams Charlie's name but at that point the scene feels too long and overdrawn.

I think the film gets cheesy if 'potions' are introduced but there could have been something with the tea. And that's what i liked about the movie, subtle clues. People seem to want ham fisted explanations and planned out scenarios. Like Wille E Coyote dropping and anvil on a lever that catapults the roadkill in just the right spot... ",8pg2ma
e0kf83l,"That's not foreshadowing, those are metaphors that amplify the beheading (ie: even if the impact of the pigeon propelled its head into the room, that's a little more direct, but it still isn't foreshadowing).

For foreshadowing to operate, we need to directly relate the terror of what MIGHT happen to Charlie as Peter drives home with what happened prior. The side-bar gimmickry of the missing epipen is what glues the metaphors together, however its still not foreshadowing. Your experience with all those details are retroactive AND none of the characters have any knowledge of the material basis for their 'foreshadowing' qualities. That's what separates great movies from middling films like this one.

Yes, I am calling that poorly planned theme of the film irrelevant, since it doesn't have correlational value: in predetermination, the horror must transcend the foreshadowing (see Don't Look Now, or Vertigo). Here it's just set decoration that implies more than it reveals (ie: if Paimun can control everything, then he's a pretty poor planner, al la his possessions and their actions/reactions. If predetermination from someone above Paimun is the rule, then the film is largely a comedy about how the family fares.)",8pg2ma
e0khge0,"There are types of terror and fear. Here, there's the manipulation of grief into terror etc. This was a kind of use of the family and misogyny as vectors for fear that I think uses women as little more than voodoo dolls for the men in the audience. It's not that they're wrong to find the film scary, it's that the film is raiding deep primal fears of manipulating mothers and then amplifying them. These are cheap shots.

The worse part is the mother, whose grief is monumental, then she becomes the demon herself, so we move from fearing for her, to fearing her. I was not scared AT ALL during the movie because I took her POV as a survivor of the unseen grandmother and I was shocked at how little the filmmaker cared about offering the Mother first as a sacrificial victim, then as a victim of herself.",8pg2ma

But within a good few minutes between both parts an entire section and two older couples walked out of theater.

For me, I understood everything. However it was an overly convoluted way to tell a possession story.

Also it would make more sense that it was fake. Because what Joanie had her do wasn’t a seance at all, but was something to call Paimon forth. She was performing that to have Annie think it was real. 
When Annie performs the second seance, it doesn’t go as expected or follow how Joanie said it would. Instead of going into the notebook (which has been possessed by Paimon), Charlie briefly goes into Annie (which I guess is how seances are “actually” supposed to go). ",8pg2ma

On a slightly related note, guessing a part of her knew Peter was going to be targeted as a host for Paimon and subconsciously wanted to kill him before he had to experience it (trying to abort him by any way she could also supports that).

But i really liked how it didn't rely on any of the cheap jumpscare or heavy makeup ghost but more of a psychological tension throughout the movie, even without all the ghost and horror scenes the drama and tension between between the family members was enough to keep me hooked, and the cinematography ofc was top notch, made every scene feel like an horror art project, i absolutely loved that. The acting by all the actors were amazing too, Alex and Toni were brilliant in their characters almost too good. Some of the scenes from the movie will stick with me forever cause they were just that good, Charlie's death scene and headbanging scene on the attic door being the main ones. Over and all i loved the movie, it's sitting rn as my number 1 scary movie, it just did for me what a lot of cheap jump scare scary movies don't and i hope to see more people making psychological thrillers in the future.

Although my sisters death was an accident, you would not believe how terrible the feeling is when you're around the long long periods of crying my mother went through when it happened. The inability to be able to sit down and the fact she was leaning over was something my mother did a lot when she was trying to cope over the loss of her baby. In the film you also see where the brother is down the hallway around the corner hearing the crying reminded me of the same situation where you feel truly helpless because of a pain that will probably never go away and to be reminded of the fact really shakes you to the core of your being.

Her accident happened over 20 years ago. In this movie it really brought forward the feeling I had when my sister died, if you really want to know the feeling of losing a child or a sibling you should watch this movie. However if you had already been through the pain I might not recommend it as it will bring the pain back.",8pg2ma

That alone lingers in the mind, but to then cut to her mangled head on the side of the road covered in ants. It's deliberately challenging and I loved it...as much as one can love a scene like that.

First of all the actual family drama was waay more intense and believable than I’ve seen in other horror movies. If the movie was just about a mother’s descent into insanity the movie would already have been successful there. The demon possession part was less about actual possession and more about the cult believing it was true and how they manipulated them. Many of the things we see in the movie could be explained by a hereditary mental illness in Annie and her children and that we just see what they see. ,8pg2ma

This can be seen by their tactic of trying to get the family to lower their guard by going to see a hokey pyschic. The book was similar in that Paimon basically used her pop culture logic against her. Its logical to us to think that the book was magically linked to her because we've seen and read similar things in stories and movies. But we're not aware of the actual capabilities and characteristics of literal supernatural beings that the film presents. Paimon is apparently very powerful, he just rarely flexes his might.

e0m07y8,"> Like wasn't Peter possessed in his classroom?

Paimon needs a very vulnerable host to possess. I think that weird constipated face was basically Peter fighting off the possession, and finally banging his head on the desk fought off Paimon for the time being. He didn't need to be dead, he just needed to be more vulnerable/weaker.

>So when did Charlie die and get possessed by Paimun originally?

Charlie never died, she was possessed as an infant by her grandmother.

>If Paimun can control houses by adding windows, why not do this earlier and behead Charlie in a simpler way?

He added windows? I missed that. But either way, I don't know what you mean by a simpler way. For one, he might have wanted Peter to blame himself for the death of his sister (making him vulnerable for possession). Also, it just seems 'complex' to us. But Paimon is a seemingly very powerful being, so what might seem simple and easy for him to do ends up looking complex to us ignorant mortals.",8pg2ma

Of note:

“...in essence, the film is an enormous ritual performed in order to move Paimon’s spirit from Charlie, Peter’s bedeviled little sister, into Peter’s body. Only in retrospect does it become clear from the very beginning, everything was part of a process that was years, or potentially even decades, in the making. Peter and Charlie’s grandmother always intended to use her descendants as a vehicle to bring her coven of witches’ preferred demon into human flesh.”

“...writer-director Aster earlier this month, the filmmaker confirmed that he views the film as an elaborate ceremony in which the main characters, and thus the audience, are cattle being led to slaughter.”

“The film is really dramatizing the last part of this long lived possession ritual, but it’s just told from the perspective of the sacrificial lambs. So we are with the family in their ignorance of what’s happening—although I do hope that there is a more sadistic knowing perspective at play as well. It should all feel inevitable, but the audience is with the family in their confusion.”

“...As Aster also said, “The last scene where Peter is made to be a vessel or the host to this demonic entity, that is literally what’s happening, and at the same time there is a metaphor there, because the film is very much about trauma and how trauma can just totally transform a person.”",8pg2ma

e0knvad,"no but like....everything that happens after that is contingent on it. and it IS objectively unexplained. saying that wasn't your biggest priority is different from saying it didn't happen.

you're allowed to like things that make mistakes. that's fine! you can defend something without saying it doesn't do what it literally does.

and that was just one example id mentioned here so far. there are many other problems with the second half of hereditary, most of which i noticed in the first place because i liked the beginning of this movie, and looked forward to seeing it, so much.

but it IS a mess by the end, even if you liked it, and everyone who has defended it to me on here and off has used a different justification, which is further proof that there are things wrong with the movie AND that, because they liked it, people are choosing to ignore or attempting to explain them away. (if these plot holes/inconsistencies did not exist, i wouldn't get 10 different explanations for why each person is willing to overlook them)

and that is fine! i dont get why everyone is so mad and doesnt think thats fine lol. like the movie, go ahead. but the writing and acting and everything implies at first that annie and charlie know more about what's going on than they do (which i think had the potential to be a much better movie, especially with the introduction of joan and the potential for an intense dramatic irony thing, especially during that first seance) and then proves in the end that they do not in a way that unravels a lot of the other things that have also been set up

ive seen this film described as a psychological thriller, family chronicle, haunted house movie, occult flick, and so many more. these elements DO NOT work cohesively together in the end and i genuinely hope, in the director's cut, that they do

but ganging up on an internet stranger does not make these issues go away

A student even remarks about how one of the play characters was blind to all of the signs around him, while we see the mother in the movie literally cataloguing all of the signs in these little miniature houses(down to the creepy writing on the wall), and still not seeing it.

Note the classroom scene: they are talking about the tragedy of Heracles and what his flaw is as a tragic hero, which is his arrogance and inability to see and interpret signs.

The cult/Paimon didn't 'make' it happen, it was just her destiny.

e17q2zt,"I still think that can align with the interpretation. The disorder is changing the world around her whether she sees it or not.

Charlie’s accident, for example, is such a random thing to happen and hard to control. Either the cult somehow manipulated the party allowing Charlie to get nuts causing the reaction in her throat thus making her roll the window down at the exact moment so she could stick her head out at that exact moment to get hit in the head by that pole with the symbol, OR, the demon influences everything, OR there are cult symbols on every pole on that road OR Annie’s subconscious as a result of her disorder creates meaning through the symbols as a way to justify the brutal meaningless death of her daughter.

My personal opinion, if I take this film as a straight forward possession cult horror thriller similar to that of Rosemary’s baby, it seems sub-par with certain scenes and meaningless complexity. But if I look at it as a tale of a woman and her family rapidly succumbing to her family’s illness, all through her perspective, I find it brilliant. ",8pg2ma

e0da4bv,"The blue light seems to be the Paimon lurking around the family. I think it can manipulate the person into doing something (like Peter’s head slamming into the desk against his will). 

I think Charlie was Paimon from the beginning. Annie had said in the support group that she didn’t allow her mother to see Peter but when she was about to have Charlie, she relented and let her mom back in. Many people think that the Grandma did a spell to put Paimon in Charlie temporarily because the demon really wanted a male body. Charlie dies, Joan comes into the picture and manipulates Annie into believing in these seances, and it allows Paimon to come in and eventually get into Peter’s body.",8pg2ma

Maybe the cult didn't know about the special circumstances surrounding the sudden trip to the hospital, but don't we see Peter driving on that road to the party with her in the back seat?

e0f76du,"The actual sacrifice/necessity is up in the air and open to interpretation. There definitely could be a theme of needing a generational sacrifice (since the decapitated bodies were of the grandmother, mother, and daughter). The grandmother did have a huge part in the cult though, and apparently it was written in the screenplay that she fed Charlie herbs that allowed Paimon into her body as a baby. 

As for Annie, it's important to note that it wasn't ""Annie"" that was chasing Peter, but another entity that had possessed Annie. The goal was to weaken him - which is why the creepy smiley man didn't just tackle him to the ground - and forcing him to watch another beheading of a close loved one made him give up. ",8pg2ma
e0ggss6,There isn’t really much more info to tell. It was played to test audiences and after the movie was over a poll regarding the ending was conducted. The results of that poll saw the majority of voters saying they thought the eye gouging ending was too disturbing so it ultimately wasn’t used.,8pg2ma
e0n3yt4,"If you can't see a plausible interpretation where the explanation is really mental illness then that's a failure of your own imagination. Even if you had a direct quote from Aster saying ""There is no conceivable interpretation where the events can all be explained by mental illness"" then you would still be wrong. 

Because *literally* everything that happens to Peter and Annie (and to a lesser degree Charlie) are clear signs of schizophrenia. Peter *literally* goes into a [catatonic state](https://sites.google.com/site/limbicsystembytaylorgallman/schizophrenia/catatonic-schizophrenia) and hears and sees things others can't. Every time something supernatural happens the only person there to witness it is either Charlie, Peter, or Annie. The only exception is when Steve sees the glass move, but Annie could've just push it with her hand.

The only way anything in this movie *makes sense* is if Annie had a psychotic break while mourning her mother's death that is exacerbated 10 fold after Charlie dies. In a manic fit she hides her grandma's body in the attic, immolates her husband, and attacks her son whom, also having had a psychotic break, perceives the attack as super natural. Do you think it makes sense that Annie magically appeared in the attic to spook Peter or that one of the naked cult members just let her in? If you want to argue about what makes *sense* I guarantee you literal flying white women decapitating themselves with piano wire doesn't help your case very much. It makes much more *sense* for that event to be a hallucination.

e0i5wvz,">Maybe you hit on something re: a newborn baby also being in a vulnerable state, bc newborn babies definitely are. But again, Peter was in a vulnerable state pretty much throughout the movie, and it just feels really arbitrary to me that only at the very end is he vulnerable ""enough."" And also, if he wasn't inhabited by Paimon until the end, what was going on when he raised his hand in class and bashed his head against the desk?

That's a good question, and one I don't have a definite answer for. My only guess would be that he was temporarily inhabited, but he hadn't been ""broken down"" enough yet to make a good permanent host. 

>And again, if they know all of that (or made all of that happen), why bother with the intricate long game?

That's why I ultimately lean more toward the sigil just being a symbol of foreboding rather than a sign that the cult has engineered this death down to the smallest detail. But even if they did/can influence all these details, perhaps that's even more disturbing? Remember the classroom scene where they talk about whether it's more terrifying to know your fate is sealed and you can't do anything to change it? The death cult needs Peter to be so mentally broken down that he can't function anymore. Drawing out his sister's demise via the allergic reaction only to ultimately have her head knocked off, making it as brutal as possible, could be on purpose. 

I might be changing my own mind on these plot points the more I talk about it. ",8pg2ma

The film itself, on a deeper level, is definitely about how our behavior impacts future generations (not just mental illness). The film's title has meanings on both levels, seeing as Grammy's bloodline seems to have an apparent significance as she tried to put Paimon in her son (pawned off as schizophrenia, but by the end we know that his mom really was trying to put people inside him), then in Charlie, with plans to move him to Peter later.

I think both the cult perspective and the mental illness perspective are both valid ways to view this movie—but I wish more people would give credit to at least the possibility of this all being Annie’s “fault”—from the very beginning we’re given over to unreliable narration. Was this entire movie taking place in a dollhouse, because the camera never panned out, never re-established the boundaries of the world as we know it. 

I do think the dollhouse/miniatures can be seen as a metaphor for the cults control OR it can be seen as Annie’s coping mechanism, with not only her hereditary mental illness but also her mother’s apparent narcissism. It’s the only thing she can control. 

Yeah, maybe the cult/demon possessed Peter OR  that was Annie moving one of her dolls, and reality manipulated because that’s Annie’s perspective. I think both her mother’s and daughter’s death caused Annie to “snap”. She began sleepwalking again and I think it was the catalyst to everything falling apart in that family. She could never connect to her daughter, and she resented her son—not only for liking his sister, but I think for never trusting Annie and wanting her to own up to her mistakes. Annie blamed her mother for everything, but really she was a spineless, cowering, fragile person who was incapable of finding and admiring fault within herself. Even if she didn’t have some sort of severe mental illness, I think the guilt of everything destroyed and ultimately undid her.",8pg2ma

People react differently than others to that kind of stuff. Was it fucked up? Yeah, but I don't think it makes him a degenerate. Also could have been seen as the very early stages of Paimon making his way into the body and clouding judgement.

""Additional dialogue recording"" is arguably less accurate because sometimes there is nothing additional about it - sometimes it's the only method of using dialogue (see basically every Italian film in the 70's - nothing but ADR) or it might've been recorded beforehand. Semantics though.

I mean. It doesnt really require foresight. I thought the filmmakers were trying to communicate with obvious foreshadowing that the family's fate is sealed from square one. The opening shot of the movie shows they are all literally pawns in a dollhouse, being controlled by an unseen force in the attic.

The first classroom scene the teacher is discussing literature and asks ""is it sadder if the characters in a story think they have a chance at self determination, or if they know their fate is predetermined?"" and a girl in the class answers back that it is better if the characters don't know, otherwise the story is hopeless and pointless.

The movie was flashing ""this family is doomed!!"" in neon lights at every opportunity. The annoying part is that you're correct that no one could have predicted the 8th king of hell thing. And that's because it was completely out of place.

They had to include shots of the mom reading a book with highlighted sections explaining what Paimon was so that the audience wasn't completely clueless. And then all they do with it is the ""ancient gods/demons stealing bodies of their followers to maintain immortality"" trope.",8pg2ma

For example, as something near the end, when the husband lit on fire spontaneously. When the son finds his body just after, it's laying length-wise in line with the fireplace and way closer to it. There's no way him falling from the position he was in would make that possible. Meaning the wife moved his body, I guess? After the demonic mind break? 

Or maybe the way events happened were different than what we saw. 

Also, why was all the furniture in the room with his body strewn about the place as if there had been a physical confrontation and a struggle?",8pg2ma

e0htc68,"There are assumptions that have to be made but not as many as you think. 

1. The main issue with the seance scene is the glass moving and the fire, that’s it. The noises can really just be explained by its a big house in the middle of the woods, noises happen randomly. The scene hinged on someone drawing on the journal like she said she saw. The glass good have been slid by either the mother or the son. 

2. The digging could have been her and she have used some mechanical help for caring the body. No one really questioned when she left the house at night, and the town felt pretty dead at night. Grave robbing doesn’t loik that difficult in that town.

3. All he cult members are probably real since I’m pretty sure they were the ones at the funeral and in photos in the grandmothers old books. They don’t have to be actual cult members, they just have to be seen once to be aide in the imagination their brains are creating. And it’s mostly not visual hallucinations for them, it’s a lot of audio that they hear. Whenever they have full on visual hallucination is when they are at their most tired and their mind needs to rest. 

4. Again, every item and drawing in the table are not foreign to Annie. She sees the drawing when she looks into her grandmother’s room and sees it on the floor. And the items are in the table are like the ones the daughter would make. 

To be fair this is just one way of viewing the movie. It is entirely possible for it to be the result of a cult. The main reason it doesn’t feel like a cult is because of the father. He handles everything like he handled this type of stuff beforehand, just not to this extreme of an episode. He’s been with the mother long enough to have dealt with a few schizo episodes. So he takes a lot in stride. ",8pg2ma

Instead of the father spontaneously bursting into flame, which is impossible, I assumed that Toni Collette burned him alive and told herself it was magic in order to not deal with the guilt of it.

Instead of Toni Collette killing herself with piano wire, I assumed that Peter killed her with it.

For me, the ending with Paimon and the cult worshippers was just Peter justifying his own insane actions to himself, almost trying to convince himself that the only way it would make the horrible things he’d been a part of okay would be if he were serving some greater, mystical purpose.

It's my understanding that Paimon is the god of many many things, including but not limited to:  knowledge of past and future events, clearing up doubts, making spirits appear, acquiring and dismissing servant spirits, reanimating the dead for several years, flight, remaining underwater indefinitely, and general abilities to ""make all kinds of things"" (and) ""all sorts of people and armor appear,"" but MOST IMPORTANTLY TO THIS CONVERSATION,  creating visions.... this would be the light.   


So why would Paimon cast an apparition of blue light to lead HIMSELF to the field to show HIMSELF the old woman burning?  


Now, granted, this could have been the occult performing a ritual as they had been doing the entire film, just out of view of the family (the carving on the telephone pole, the black triangles, the candles, the head in the treehouse), however due to the angle of Annie's approach when she chastises Charlie for wordlessly leaving the house, shoeless, I don't buy that she just WOULDN'T see this person burning in a field in broad daylight.   


Leading me to believe that Paimon is housed within Charlie, but not able to take over full control, so he leaves the body and BECOMES the blue light (we can see this whenever Paimon embodies someone, the bluee light washes over them and IN to them)  


What bothers me is Paimon could not take full control of a female host. But He inhabited Annie MULTIPLE times to do his bidding. Some of instances you could claim were sleepwalking or schizophrenia, but when the blue light washes over Annie and her face suddenly sinks from torture at witnessing her husbands death to calm, that is Paimon inhabiting her body while she is at her most weakened state. But one could argue he has FULL. COMPLETE. CONTROL. Up until this point, there was a motif of Annie/Peter WAKING UP from being controlled/sleep walking when some real shit went down (when Peter got his face smashed, when Annie struck the match, or choked out Peter, not saying th match was Paimon, that's just another hit on the pattern).   


But then It's flip\-turned upside down when she starts fly\-crawling everywhere, beatin some ass, slamming her head in to the ceiling and PIANO WIRING HER HEAD OFF. Not once does she wake up or does Paimon lose contrl after that point.  


If he had full control of Annie, it seems like you DIDN'T need a male host. Unless this would have only lasted so long, until the shock of witnessing her husbands death had warn off, then Paimon would be expelled or stifled?",8pg2ma

Wouldn't he have been on board?  We are seeing what she sees and she reacts too, the other are more playing off her her.  The moving of the glass is a Oijia board thing, she easily just pushes it.  She is clearly totally manic at that point and that would be more than enough to freak out her son and husband.

Imagine you are in a room and your mom is losing her mind but you cannot figure out why she is doing it. She jumps at the flame then they react to her jumping for some reason explains it just as well as them seeing a flame.  We see the flame so we assume they can see it as well but just like A Beautiful Mind we are seeing things on screen that maybe not all the characters are seeing so we make assumptions about what they are actually reacting too.

Look at all the naked people at the end.  Mom and dad never see them, it is only Peter because that is his delusion which is not the same as the Mothers where he has fully disassociated due to the Dissociative identity disorder that they said she passed on.

add to that:and I'll be more specific, there's no deep logic to the film. she clucks, he hears clucks out of the ether. he's possessed by paimun in his class, and then he's REALLY possessed by paimun after he tosses himself out of the window... which is it? that's what the cliches are, they're everywhere here recycled only for effect, there's no organized logic here. when you ask anyone 'when was Peter possessed?' anyone can answer a or b and so the ending makes only a small amount of sense. the film could have ended with his possession at any point after the desk slam. it's pile on the extras at the salad bar and then organize it with a low-grade speech playing the dressing.

Like I believed the cult was real, and that they were truly into the mythology, but I perceived the actual demonic entities to be psychologically conjured, not physically conjured. 

Like I mentioned before, I thought the supernatural phenomena like astral projection, heads rolling, etc were manifestations of the psychological feels of dissociation and severing of memories & loss of the inner character who holds those memories.

I looove demons, cults, and mythology, but I really thought the film was more interesting perceiving that instead of supernatural phenomena it was ACTUAL transgressive human experience.

e4iotg5,"Another thing I thought of re:  Steven's behavior.  Charlie.  Remember how he went up to the treehouse to go fetch her and his conversation there?  He was chastising her, with ""what are you doing, you're going to get pneumonia"".  Well, I don't have a child, but if I did, and she was sleeping in a treehouse, and her grandmother whom she was very close to just died, I wouldn't launch into a mini scolding session just minutes before the grandmother's funeral.  Presumably as a psychiatrist he's doing more than just prescribing meds (although he was heavy on the meds himself in this film) and also should have some degree of interpersonal skills and compassion.  I don't think he treated Charlie appropriately given the tragic loss of her grandmother, as a psychiatrist or even as a plain human being.  

As I mentioned in an earlier post, one of the most tragic scenes to me (and outstanding acting) is just post the dinner fight, where Steven says nothing, takes his hand and touches Peter for a second, tries to eat, and then his knife and fork down and gives up.  I have compassion for Steve at that moment as you can see the heartbreak in his body language.  While I have compassion for him and his suffering, his behaviors (or lack thereof) played a strong role in the demise of the family, and it makes me angry too!  :)  ",8pg2ma
e4nprig,"In thinking about this, I don't think anyone is perfect.  I don't mean to be blaming anyone.  Perhaps my reaction is a backlash to the (very unfounded and superficial that I shan't repeat) vitriol I saw over many weeks about Annie and Charlie.  Ok. Let's be objective.  From viewing the family, I think Steve lost a lot of respect within his family, not just to us as the viewers.  As just one example (I have several more), when Peter comes home from school and runs up the stairs, and Steven says, ""hey sign up for that SAT course"" (or something similar)  Peter runs up with his dirty shoes on and doesn't even (ok, barely) acknowledges his father.  At that point, to Peter, Steve isn't someone to be respected.  At the beginning of the film, after the grandmother's funeral when everyone comes home, Steve says ""shoes off, shoes off everyone"" and everyone does this except for Annie (you'll see she's in her shoes on the carpet chit-chatting with Steve).  Steve lost his hold as a credible role model as I believe as he checked out of being one himself early on.  The family caught on.  Yes, he was suffering.  So was the rest of the family.  Steve was apparently the counseling expert.  His wife, and son, were clearly unraveling in front of him.  You don't have to spend four years in Med School to see this.  Steve chastised Annie after an apparent episode where Peter thought he was being punished by a vengeful spirit.  There is no reason at that point to not involve an external objective counselor to help the family.  But Steve chose to not involve anyone else.  Why?  My guess:  pride.  He never successfully did find help for himself nor his family.  To his own, and his family's demise.  ",8pg2ma

What we see in Charlie was always Paimon, with the drawings, toy making, and fear that was shown. The only reason why the grandma came back into Annie's life was because of Paimons birth.

She was construed as a cruel and selfish woman and I liked that bit, I expected to find out why she was cruel and selfish, but I felt like at the end it was 'because she was just bad'.

e17r2jj,"first, please interpret it the way you like best, maximum enjoyment i say! i'm just up for discussion of the movie because i liked it and found it interesting. that said...

mental disorders do not change the real world. those glimpses the director gave the audience was purposeful, so that we knew there was something else going on. annie went to joan for help, why would the director show us a secret (joan's ritual) and not show that annie saw the secret too? if it was the way you said, annie would have said or at least alluded to something about the ritual behind the door.

same thing with the pole. the accident is mysterious yes. but the director let the audience in on a little secret with the symbol on the pole. there is no indication that annie was in on that...wouldn't she have said something? ""my mother wore a symbol just like that"". if it was important why did she never say anything about it?

how the cult made the beheading happen? if we take my interpretation, Paimon is there the whole time which makes it pretty easy with a little ritual magic as a guide. the goal was not only to behead charlie but to make peter suffer in the process so the death had to be believable and his fault.

The themes are clear, the things that happen do happen. But it’s vague in the sense that no meaning is shoved down our throats, we take what we choose or happen to find. 

My take:
The way she was treated was horrifying to watch, and not in a gore porn way. Just difficult to watch and prompting thoughts about how the world treats women, and the struggle our society pushes them into. What I saw was also a denunciation of the relationship she had with her husband, someone who was clearly villainous but (if I remember correctly) presented in an almost positive light, as though he were well-meaning throughout. If not that, he was at least never outright called out for how he acted. And yet, he was clearly in the wrong. To me, this was an examination of the opposite sort to the first, a look at how our society trusts men implicitly, in addition to showing the damage a man can do either in a relationship or to women in general, shown in an ugly and brutal way. And there’s a lot more to say about the film’s critique of the male ego, which was probably where it shone most. 

You could see this as a film about an abusive relationship, you could see this as a film that sharply criticizes the male ego, you could see this as a general examination of men and women and society, but you chose to see it as exactly what was presented on the screen and didn’t bother to look any deeper. 

And don’t get me wrong, it’s extremely questionable to represent things like this on screen. But, at least for me, the shock strengthened the critique tenfold. The way you felt walking out of that film was the way a majority of people felt, disgusted and angry, which was exactly the point. Not to glamorize, to enrage and to critique. ",8pg2ma

There are clearly references made in the text to mental illness, and there’s meant to be some ambiguity whether the film is about a family following each other into madness or whether it’s, you know— ""  

He does say the end is explicit in that same interview and that some might be disappointed it is not more ambiguous, but then in another interview he gives a conflicting answer, as if he is trying to purposefully muddy those waters.  So while the ending is explicitly telling us something, in my mind I lean a bit more towards unreliable narrator than supernatural possession.

I understand why the Hollywood elite liked this movie. They automatically like any film with a message. I feel like it's more of a political statement than ab film critique.

The reason many people loved the show  LOST was all the mystery but, the same people hated the ending because many mysteries werent explained. I love an ending where the audience gets to decide for themselves or mysteries are left unanswered. This just is a mess of half formed metaphors and lore of demonology that has a definite meaning that EVERYONE is supposed to gleen. I didnt have  any issue figuring it out but, many people left my theatre having no idea what just happened. I spent upward of 20 minutes explaining the movie to a large group of really nice people that were very lost. (See what i did there) That isnt ""smart"" horror, it is bad storytelling.

Foreshadowing operates as a sensational dread of inescapable fate that builds. Few directors can pull this off. Donnie Darko is another intensely foreshadowed film.

Here it's just pastiche markers that requires an enormously impossible needle thread for it to work (ie: the mystically impossible controller) not any sense of inescapable fate.

Laughing does not remotely imply the viewer is not taking it seriously. Nor does it kill the mood unless you really have the stick up your ass about what is an appropriate way to respond. It is a natural visceral reaction like gasping or shrieking. Horror much like comedy is fundamentally about about a buildup of expectations turned into a subversion of said expectations, and there are people for which their natural reaction to something intense and surprising is laughing even if they are freaked the fuck out because they occupy such a similar mental space. Let alone the fact people laugh simply to release the tension the movie gives them because they can't take it. There is absolutely nothing about it that goes against appreciating the intensity of them.

Implying people should suppress their gut feelings and and prevent themselves from getting into a movie because you think they're doing it the wrong way is the selfish behavior here and completely opposite to what a fan of a genre should be doing. People love this genre for the captivating experience and trying to keep people from that because their reaction doesn't match what you think is correct is the shittiest form of gatekeeping. I'd be inclined to say the exact opposite of what you do, if you can't handle that people react to a genre designed to provoke primordial fight-or-flight instincts and paranoia in a wide variety of ways, you're the one that shouldn't be seeing a horror movie in a public space.",8pg2ma

You see her banging on the door and behind her is a camera.  That camera I see as providing an objective view of the scene, much like they mention before when she is making the crash diorama.

If I was right you have a woman who is off her meds, as the last time you see her take them is back the first time she is in that apartment, and she gets paranoid.

When she runs away looking like she has figured something  out only then do we get a view from inside the apartment.  that is not something she or any of our point of view characters can see.

I am personally the big fan of horrors, my partner and I needed to kill time so literally just walked into the next film that was showing (though she is a massive horror fan, it will be noted, so she persuaded me - though refused to even barter with the new Johnny English, I love Atkinson but she hates him, though I digress). As a performer, and someone who has needed to direct stuff on stage in the past, dreams of movie directing, yadda yadda, if I personally am presented with something this freaking beautiful (even down to the match before the first séance, for instance), with such deal emotion, that if I am just presented with what amounted to effectively shock visual horror, especially juxtaposing with the actual horror of the lad calling for his ""mommy"" it brings me nearly completely out of it.

I do not know what I would have done. I'll admit that. Honestly, I've seen arguments both ways through the comments about whether it should have been solely about mental illness or not, but I do kinda wish it were. It is how I would have done it, and I feel would have more inpact in me and my situation. I can hold my partner's hand through a mother yelling at her son that he wasn't wanted because my partner is the young mother of an accidental three year old. A child who brought with him a shit tonne of mental strain. I can't empathise with someone six foot in the air moving at super human speed.

That is my reasoning behind being in the chuckle category, at least for those specific images. They weren't poorly done (looking at you, weird Skype movie trailer). They were pretty freaky.

You really cant imagine a scenario where someone goes with their friends to see a scary movie, perhaps being convinced into it even though they're afraid, and then once they're seated in the theater deciding they actually cant go through with it?  To you, this situation is ""definitely"" a depiction of a mentally insane person?



**Edit:** I think our conflict is coming from the manner in which the person said ""I'm leaving"".  Did they just say ""I'm leaving"" to their friends in a normal voice that people could overhear, or as your put it, did they ""get up in front of the entire crowd"" to announce ""'Hey everyone I'm leaving!"".

Even if it happened how you are picturing it, I  think that person is probably a bit weird, or maybe they're just friendly and the people nearby have been chatting casually with each other, even though they're strangers.

You're saying it's not Annie, Peter, or Joan. It's certainly not the dad. It's also certainly not Charlie, since she dies pretty early on. 

It's pretty obvious that it takes place in objective reality. The only other possible explanation is that each character is hallucinating independent of the others, and somehow their hallucinations have combined to create the story we are seeing. Which makes no real sense.

About the foreshadow stuff, I think you can catch a lot of things the first time you watch, like Charlie cuting the bird's head off, so I can't even imagined what a second view might do to this movie.  

I was waiting for a twist like Annie knew what she was doing and was possessed, but a second view probably will put her in a different spotlight, because she is the victim of everything, the things that happened to her family and even things outside of her control that happened before she was born. She tried to burn herself and the children because she knew something was wrong, even unconciusly, but everyone puts the blame on her and her family (the brother and father deaths for instance). There is so much to unpack in this movie, It's on my top 5 of the year so far.

e0l3j1r,"I'm with you, it's absolutely ridiculous and is meant to be. They took it too far and stretched past the point of credibility, but I think they did that on purpose to show how hopeless Peter's situation actually was.  It gets worse and worse the more you think about it:  why didn't Peter just call 911? Who the hell even makes a cake DURING a high school house party? 

I would propose the sequence of events was purposefully made so absurd it couldn't have been interpreted as the working of men, probably the cult knew nothing about what would happen and instead just carved their symbol into a pole, probably not even knowing why.  It reminds me of Greek tragedy where characters would see a soothsayer that would foretell their death, then go to ridiculous lengths to ensure that death couldn't happen.  Then through a similarly ridiculous chain of events the exact tragedy would happen anyway.  

I think that's what the director was going for, even if they weren't completely successful in the execution.  Really sorry for the book sized response, thanks for reading and for sharing your opinion.

Something to consider is the fact that the actual treehouse isn't possibly big enough to fit all the people in that final scene, so it's possible that this is also a supernatural space that is outside our understanding of space and time.",8pg2ma

e0wcd18,"I watched a few explanation videos and read up on Paimon to clearly understand this issue. The sign on Annie’s necklace/the Cult’s sign represents 4 figures and in the bottom 3 circles. Paimon needs 3 decapitations in order to fully complete his “possession” of the healthy male body. You’re completely right about the rules being kind of bent, and clearly Paimon doesn’t give a crap about the gender of its host. I think, as previously mentioned somewhere on this thread, Ellen was able to permanently mark Paimon onto Charlie (“You were her favorite” “She would’t even let me feed you” “She wanted me to be a boy”) so part of Paimon was always deep inside Charlie as his soul might be the vessel. The ritual itself to bring riches and whatever the cult wanted out of him needed 3 decapitations, and the Cult orchestrated the other two (the grandma, Charlie) and when Annie was tricked into thinking the notebook would kill her, but it killed her husband instead, you can see her horrified face im front of his husband’s burning body suddenly turning into a straight face, as if something entirely entered her, and then it cuts to Peter’s scene waking up. I suppose Paimon possesed Annie into sacrificing (decapitating) herself with the piano wires in order to successfully complete the ritual by decapitation. Which I think would have been less confusing and so much better to the plot line if the cult members themselves would have sacrificed Annie on their own instead of her killing herself under the control of an unknown force.

That was actually one of the shots that solidified my belief in the disorder interpretation. If the director was trying to fool us with a psychosis red herring, why show us so many shots only to the audience that contradicts that. So to me, either the director is trying to show these absurdly convenient images outside of the character’s perspective to fool us into believing that it’s real when it isn’t or the director is really that cliche and he filmed a mediocre film masterfully.

I know I could be reading to much into it because I will like it better one way and not the other. 

This reminds me of a similar conversation that I had with a friend who believed that Bateman in the American Psycho film made up the murders in his mind as a way of coping with society around him, I thought that he actually committed the murders. Although the director had their own view, art can transcend the director’s vision and take on new meanings.

Is the club scene in *Mulholland Drive* Diane's actual fantasy, or is it Lynch's artistic license that is not actually happening in any character's mind but is rather just an experience for the audience? I would argue the latter, and I would do the same for the ending of *Hereditary*. As for the stuff where the mother is on the walls and ceiling (and sawing her own head off - yikes), I think that's all Peter. Both Peter and Annie have hallucinations, but I don't think the film ever shows them having the same visions. They're both freaked out in the conjuring scene, but nothing explicitly paranormal happens there. I see it as Annie freaking out and Peter having an episode as his mother goes wild.

This movie was about the futility of tradition and namely the continuation of the commercialization of Star Wars. It was a statement that boldly said, ""Star Wars hasn't been good for decades, and the only reason you like these is because they're Star Wars."" This is perfectly exemplified by the scene where Rose and Finn first meet. Rose is the fanbase and Finn is the franchise. She tells him that she's been incapacitating deserters while also praising him for his heroics, right as he's about to desert. Their whole arc is about the wonder of fantastic cinema and how to peel enjoyment out of commercialized art.

In that spirit, they actually gave Kylo and Rey *character* while giving Snoke a proper purpose as a villain. He became the trial that the two of them had to complete together, and despite the fact that they went through the same thing they're coming out on the other side diametrically opposed.

Just like the audience is supposed to. As from that moment onwards, the story is very straight forward. 

What you're saying is the pretty much the equivalent of people believing the Earth is flat even though we have proof of it being round.

That's exactly what the father was, he was the only voice of ""reason"", and the last hope that these things really WERE just in Annie's head.

As another user wrote, the schizophrenia was a red herring. You were MEANT to view Annie as crazy and this all being bullshit, just as her husband did.

But then like classic mystery tales, the red herring is dismissed and the real perpetrator (Paimon) comes through. There are MANY clues and literal statements confirming this. Sticking your head in the sand is not going to change that.

e1byhay,"Hey - no need to apologise. It's just a civil conversation, and everyone's entitled to how they feel/interpret film. 

Yes, laughter is an involuntary reflex - to a point. The context of a situation can inform how likely you are to laugh or not. If someone trips in falls in the street, you might laugh about it. If someone trips and falls at a funeral, I dare say you wouldn't. Same thing - different context. While the screening of a horror movie is certainly not as serious as a funeral, I hope you see the point I'm trying to make about your ability to hold laughter when inappropriate. 

I guess the point I struggle to wrap my head around is how the sequence of a young girl being decapitated, or her mother's wails, would even invite a burst of laughter? Granted, you said it was partly due to how the sequence had been edited together, and I can imagine in your mind that you thought ""hey, this is kind of like on American Dad. That's funny."" But to have an uncontrollable burst of laughter at a moment that is so purposefully crafted to have the opposite effect is just strange to me (and I hope you'll forgive me for saying, I still think quite inconsiderate to others around you). 

We're never going to change each other's minds, nor I suppose should we try. Each take is as valid as the other's. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the movie bud, hopefully the next one will do the trick.",8pg2ma
e0igjlx,"I think it was, or else they might not have had cause to dig up her grave and replace her body in the attic. Two theories here, both of which implicate Granny's death:  

First, and less likely: it was actually the grandma posing as Charlie's a spirit in the house (although I guess this wouldn't explain Annie being possessed by Charlie briefly during the seance) to entice Annie to unwittingly follow the plan. This to me *would* however more strongly explain Charlie's spirit's notably malevolent disposition toward her parents considering that she didn't seem like an angry, or even emotional child (e.g., never cried).

Second would be that her body simply needed to be there to complete the ritual. As the person who put Paimon in Charlie's body, she likely had already set things in motion to transport the demon to Peter's body while still alive. She may have even died as part of the ritual - perhaps as a blood sacrifice, which would tie in a bit more strongly to her decapitated head. Could be that all of the relatives on Annie's side of the family who were alive during the time of Peter or Charlie's birth needed to be decapitated as part of the ritual - consider that they made a point out of also underlining the early and untimely deaths of Annie's other relatives, likely before the birth of her children.  

Finally, less of a theory and more of just a fact: when Annie read that letter in the beginning (when her Grandma's apparition appeared before her), the note explicitly stated that this would all be worth the reward at the end. There was definitely a goal grandma had in mind at some point, and it seemed to imply that her death was going to be worth that reward.

The only times we're looking through the husband's perspective is when he's in his office or driving his son home and nothing happens  in either of those scenes. 

And the only incident where the husband saw anything potentially supernatural was the seance and we were firmly in the wife's perspective in that scene, so we can't be sure if things there happened as we saw or not.

Like imagine making this really fantastic and artistic horror film, only to have audiences laugh at it. Wouldn't that suck? And you're totally fooling yourself if you think people are laughing out of a natural response to fear. When the was the last time you were in a fight or flight situation in real life and you start laughing? They're laughing because they find what they see cheesy or ""cringe"". It got so bad in my audience that ushers had to come and tell people to shut up. That means they're being disruptive.

Paimon is less a figure and more of a force.. if that makes sense. Mom didn't allow Grandma access to Peter when he was born so she wasn't able to insert Paimon into him. She wished Charlie had been a boy (multiple references throughout the movie) and inserted him into her despite it being less than ideal. He controls Charlie but due to her being a female he isn't able to fully express his powers. He needed to break down Peter completely in order to full take control and be at maximum strength. He could only briefly control him in the school because he was mentally still too strong. After seeing his dead Dad, being attacked by Mom, seeing the naked cult members, seeing Mom killing herself.. he finally snapped and was weak enough to be possessed. The cult facilitated everything by manipulating the Mom and Peter with the seance, incantations, etc.

predictable isn't a problem with hereditary, i liked that it made sense. what made it not a masterpiece is going just a little too far with the supernatural. for example, i would have had Annie cut her own head off in the treehouse after climbing in, instead of floating. just a little more subtlety.

Joan calls Peter ‘Charlie’ at the end ... that’s nothing to do with his sister... that’s Paimon.

Many folks have been getting confused with this whole Charlie naming business because none of this is telegraphed... yet all the clues are there to piece it together and why I love this movie",8pg2ma

I think I was expecting it to be scarier throughout, which could be why I was disappointed with it. I hate jup scares too, but there were just long swaths of emotional crying throughout this movie, there were pretty long gaps inbetween anything actually *scary*, it was more scary in a 6th Sense way, like an emotional horror movie (some of which I like, I thought Babadook was pretty good).  My family hyped this movie as ""a truly scary movie"" and it seemed more like a drama with some scary parts (although that neck grinding scene...*shudders*) I actually loved the cinematography and acting in everyone in this movie, it just immediately started to remind me of Rosemarrys baby and I couldn't get it out of my head.

e0jcses,">red herring of family trauma and mental illness being the real culprit of everything. 

I viewed it as the real culprit because the supernatural elements are never confirmed by a neutral third party. Anything ""unexplainable"" is seen from the perspective of someone with some sort of hereditary mental illness.",8pg2ma
e1u7h1k,"OK maybe I'm totally full of shit on this but I thought mental illness was still definitely the ""real culprit"" and even though this is a thousand days too late and unnecessary I'm gonna monologue about why;

 When Annie picks up the book with the passage on paimon it said he looks for vulnerable male hosts. Annie's mom, I thought, might have been carrying paimon in search of a vulnerable male host, which explains being diagnosed with DID, but the real hereditary gift was that the women, to some extent, carry and channel paimon. 

The note she left for her daughter in the expositional book read, to me, like she was in it for the long game though, that she knew Annie was going to have to pick up this ongoing ritual, and in the euology Annie said her father had psychotic depression, her brother had schizophrenia, and they both met these intensely terrible ends. I interpreted that as a suggestion that Leigh had been deliberately plotting a legacy of hereditary mental illness for her progeny, as well as passing on the intense trauma of horrific familial deaths, to produce a vulnerable male host for paimon. When Charlie was born vaginated, the subsequent horrors of the movie were, in part, to traumatize Peter who already had a genetic predisposition to being mentally ill/vulnerable, to get him to a place where paimon could take over without too much of a fight. 

In hindsight a lot of the mysteries of the movie were the cultists keeping a really close eye on the family while they engineered these situations too, like when Charlie sees a woman and a fire in the woods, or a woman waving at her from school, or there is one scene that shows the house at night and a warm steamy breath floats across the scene. And if you already have a predisposition towards a mental illness like, say, psychotic depression, the feeling of being watched would contribute to the total breakdown they needed.

But who knows I saw it last night and could be full of nonsense. Scared the absolute shit out of me though. ",8pg2ma

Once you know it, the trepidation stops and it becomes a movie about a character reacting to creepy things to find a solution rather than you, the audience,  doing so.

The fact that about 10% of my theatre had a laugh / ""oh so that's whats going on"" type reaction didn't help",8pg2ma

The point I'm trying to make, though, is that even at that funeral, is there nothing that could make you laugh? You wouldn't expect to be laughing at a funeral, but it could certainly happen.

And I didn't go to this movie thinking I would be laughing. And for the record, I didn't really. I did a pretty good job of contsining it. Though, some snickers might have escaped. I did my best.

But it's like the scene at the end where she's Spider-manned up on the wall, and he's sitting on the bed. You could see her faint outline up in the corner. You even heard gasps through the theater like something bad was gonna happen. 

I mean, I was fully expecting something scary to happen right then. Camera pans to him, and changes angle, and I'm thinking she's gonna be behind him or something. Just suddenly pounce and grab him. My mind is racing with the expectation. 

And instead she ninja swims through the air out the door.

There was laughter from people at this point. Because we were all expecting the worst, and instead, it was something silly.

I went into the movie completely blind and had no idea what to expect and I’m glad I did.  The most unsettling bit of all, though, was Collette’s reactions to finding her daughter and her scenes up through the funeral.  So incredibly visceral.  

And now that I’m typing that, I think I figured out why I wanted there to be at least some possibility that the whole thing was psychosis - through that point of the movie, everything was so grounded in the true terrors that befall people everyday that I wanted that to continue throughout the movie.  I think halfway through, I was expecting and hoping that *Hereditary* would actually accomplish what *Babadook* was aiming for, and, in my opinion, failed to accomplish.  It sidestepped and went a different direction, which is fine - I’m with you, I love occult-based stuff - but it didn’t go where I was expecting it to go.",8pg2ma

I liked how the movie was realistic for a  horror movie  not   too many jump scares or happy  end  I liked that the cult  actually won because in real life  if this happened  98% would  lose against  some demonic cult  magic   sure Annie was spiritual but   they knew what was up how to do it hell  even Joanne was manipulating her  she only got the clue last min.

I'll need clarification. You begin speaking of The Exorcist, and I agree, having more from the book would have made the film richer. 

But in the Omen, I don't believe Damian was ever wrestling with anything. He was evil incarnate. ",8pg2ma
e1b6zlr,"I totally understand your point. Again, the comparison to Rosemary´s Baby arises (Maybe it didn´t need the glowy red eyes in the end?)
The headless body floating might have been a tad too much (many teenagers giggled at that moment in the movie theatre), I think the director really wants to make a point out of Paimon being a very real thing. It didn´t diminish my experience with the movie, because I still could enjoy it as a family drama, surrounded by a ""context"" of a horror story. Btw, I googled a bit on Paimon just for info regarding the movie, and apparently there are a lot of wackos out there who REALLY are ""followers"", make pacts and worship him.

",8pg2ma
e5qhsd0,"Charlie never really was ""Charlie"", she has been Paimon since birth, but whenever Paimon takes a vessel he forgets who he is, and someone has to make him remember. Grandma Leigh never let ""Charlie"" know who she really was until she could secure a male vessel. If Paimon ""wakes up"" and finds out he's in a female vessel, he could pitch a murder-fit. So, Granny and her cult arranged for Charlie's beheading, to free Paimon and make Peter vulnerable enough to be possessed, through mental/emotional trauma.

So, Paimon/Charlie didn't know he/she was about to die.",8pg2ma

e0lxdo4,"Not everything needs to be spelled out perfectly in the movie. Sometimes it’s a matter of figuring things out for yourself. There was visual cues to hint at cult and ritual influence. Annie was trying to interfere with their plan so she needed to die. She was aware of the supernatural shit going on so Paimon took control and killed her by decapitation, which was a recurring theme for every female member in the family. The husband was a by-product of the Ritual, he wasn’t blood related but Annie accidentally killed him anyway.
