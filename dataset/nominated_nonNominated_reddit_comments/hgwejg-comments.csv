fw71b3e,"If the guy wasn’t good looking, this would be the most disgusting piece of trash ever. Imagine if a fat slob mafia dude was cast as Massimo.",hgwejg
fw6fzop,"Genuinely the worst erotic film I have ever seen in my life. The dialogue is laughable and the soundtrack is unbelievably annoying. The director also fucks around with the camera way too much with endless pans.

This film makes 50 Shades of Grey look like The Handmaiden and I am glad Roger Ebert never lived to see this film.",hgwejg
fw6lcy8,"I never thought I would see a day where a movie made 50 Shades of Grey look good, but 365 happened.

This is hands down the worst movie I have seen this year and will probably stay that way.

The fact that this movie is making abuse, asssult, and Stockholm Syndrome look hot is fucking disgusting.",hgwejg
fw704nb,"That yacht scene was 😰
Terrible film and I cringe for my friend who ended up watching it with her MOTHER!",hgwejg
fw8o6zt,"the thing that annoys me the most about all the thinkpieces being written about this is how they describe the film as completely devoid of value except as masturbatory material.

i would actually go further and argue the film isn't even worth watching in that regard. people are probably gonna check out this movie thinking it's shitty but super sexy, and end up wasting their time when they realize it's about as arousing as watching grass grow.

aside from the sex scene on the yacht filmed with the drones, which is only notable due to the camera angles and how overlong the scene itself is, the sex scenes are nothing you haven't seen before in a Cinemax (Skinemax) show that airs after 11:30 PM. i actually found most of the passionate scenes extremely offputting given the film's propensity to frame the male and female lead as sexy bantering rivals rather than, you know, a kidnapper and his fucking kidnapping victim.",hgwejg
fw6v6kp,"I actually didn't expect anything to beat ""The Grudge"" as the worst film of 2020 but wow... this movie in a word... despicable.

99 out of 100 times, I don't have trouble with the subject matter of a film but with ""365 Days"" there were multiple times here I audibly questioned what I was seeing on screen. It's horrible! This girl gets kidnapped and sexually assaulted for an hour and then the rest of the film she pretty much has Stockholm Syndrome. 

The only saving graces from this film are the very few clever lines, the bad english, and honest to god, THE SOUNDTRACK! The soundtrack is ""The Room"" level bad and it makes every scene hilarious!",hgwejg
fwg3vjg,I’m pleasantly surprised to see how few comments this thread has. It means most people’s time hasn’t been wasted in this utter steaming pile of shit.,hgwejg
fwqy1ti,"If it wasn't for Netflix, then this movie would have faded into obscurity as a *Fifty Shades* wannabe from Poland.

Netflix is to entertainment what Facebook is to information.",hgwejg
fw7giiy,"On a scale from 50 Shades to After, it’s straight-up softcore porn.",hgwejg
fy8ui7z,"Unpopular opinion: It was STILL a way better movie than any of the 50shades. I think the chemistry between the two is what makes it work. The dialogue needs work for sure and if they continue, they need to stray away from the book ending. It's Anna-Maria and Michele that make the chemistry so fire that people enjoy it. I won't deny they didn't do a good job of setting up the plot in the script. It was all over the place, hopefully now that netlflix is involved it gets cleaned up. (Cleaned up meaning a more organized script....lets keep the steam LOL)",hgwejg
fwi264x,"I highly doubt anything is going to top this film for worst movie of 2020, and that includes Artemis Fowl and The Grudge!",hgwejg
fxjuqhl,Of cours I’m old enough to know that not all movies should be about healthy relationships and two cutie pies falling in love. And I actually love a good erotic movie (Fatal attraction? Basic Instinct? Wide closed eyes?) and would like to watch a soft porn with a good storyline. But god this movie is awful just awful story is ridiculous the acting sucks (lucky for them and the audience that the leading actors are very hot) sex scene are very hard to watch and yes it’s rape and sexual assaults and the girl is making sexy faces when she suppose to be horrified. The leading man is telling the girl in a sexy romance voice that he will not force himself into her while he is actually kidnapped her and caging her for a year!!!! this movie was described for me by a friend saying “it’s literally 50 shades of grey without the cringe” but I would say this movie is even cringer,hgwejg
hleh0gf,"It's to appeal the people who like 50 Shades. It's trashy, but there's audience for that, specially frustrated women who are too prude to watch porn or explore their sexualities and dream to marry an abusive bad boy billionaire. It's ficiton after all, some of the elements are closer modern fairy tale, but then we remember that real life billionaires aren't the nice guys and the prince charming in the movie is an assassin from mafia. 

**The good**: the actors were good looking and had chemistry. Also the luxury setting and sexy scenes are good to look at, the movie make itself from the visuals only. 

**The bad**: everything else. It glorified rape, sexism, the female protagonist was vapid, the male protagonist was a criminal, the narrative structure is messy and confusing.  

It did the soft porn better than 50 shades, since Dakota and Jamie had zero chemistry. But the plot managed to be even a bit worse. I gave 3/10 only because of the scenarios and the sex scenes looked realistic.",hgwejg
fwmnz8p,"I just came here hoping someone would shed some light on whether these sex scenes are real.  I tend to agree with all the criticisms but was intrigued by the occasional cock shaft.  Ftr, I’ve seen news articles from the actors saying they weren’t real but I don’t buy it necessarily.",hgwejg
i07dao2,this was trending in so many countries. like there's just seriously no fate left in humanity.,hgwejg
fw7jwpa,Very disappointed with this film.  The lead actors have more chemistry than the 50 shades actors but the dialogue makes me cringe.  How can Massimo judge a man for child trafficking but he himself is guilty of kidnapping?  My favourite erotic film will still remain 9 1/2 weeks.  Mickey Rourke was the bomb!,hgwejg
iindyc6,"To be honest, Michele is the only reason I 've watched 365 days.",hgwejg
ieopaky,365 dayıs,hgwejg

fw8swly,"Lol someone wrote on Letterboxd that if the guy was ugly then this would be a horror film. Then someone else (obv jokingly said), “I tried to follow his footsteps and now I got court next week”. Lmao.",hgwejg
fw9xr4s,"Well yeah, that *is* why it’s so popular. Gratuitous male nudity is something that isn’t seen very often in mainstream movies, and this movie has a LOT of gratuitous male nudity. This movie finds every excuse to get this man shirtless/nude as often as possible while the main actress is relatively clothed. 

It’s the only thing that this movie gets right, because *nothing else makes sense*.",hgwejg
fw7hmev,[deleted],hgwejg
fw7x4py,"> the soundtrack is unbelievably annoying.

I found that the soundtrack made it better. It reminded me of how bad ""The Room"" soundtrack was",hgwejg
fwoldgi,So it's basically most Hermione/Draco fanfiction but put in movie form?,hgwejg
fw8e02u,I can’t imagine a worse movie to watch with your mother,hgwejg
hlid5vz,Omg this made me howl,hgwejg
fwbm06d,This. I’ve seen PG-13 films that got me more hot and bothered than 365 Days. That teleporting yacht sex made me howl with laughter.,hgwejg
fxq7v7q,"I'll never understand why people consider sex scenes in movies to be so alluring. Specially things like this one and 50 Shades, where consent is dubious AT BEST.

If you want to watch two hotties going at it, go to Pornhub, for fuck's sake. At least they will both agree to it.",hgwejg
gegbo5z,">about as arousing as watching grass grow

I need to use this phrase more lmao",hgwejg
fw7wd9t,"is this film worth watching in a 'laughably bad' kind of way, like The Room?",hgwejg
fwg59sz,"My girlfriend loves this movie and I had to watch it with her one of the four or so times she's seen it.

It's pretty bad but I did enjoy the idiosyncrasies in the dialogue due to the language barrier between the lead roles. I liked teasing my girlfriend over how dumb the movie was, as well.",hgwejg
i3xa2tm,Omg you are RIGHT! just realized this.,hgwejg
gegbl9o,"Couldn't feel the chemistry, personally",hgwejg
iinf0rg,"I think Jamie and Dakota had chemistry.  I don't think Michele and Anna did.  She's pretty, but I picture him with someone more exotic.  Sorry, but that's my opinion.",hgwejg
insll4p,"Dakota and Jamie had intense chemistry on and off camera.  Both of them absolutely gorgeous. I'm sorry but I cannot compare 365 days with Fifty Shades of Grey.  After the first FSOG it led to a love story.  Yes, Christian needed help and Anna did just that. She did not run away and cheat on Christian. Laura on the other hand is a cheater.  
This is my opinion.  The only reason I watched 365 days was for Michele.  I watched the third and couldn't get past 1/2 hour, maybe!! Michele is very handsome and talented.   Needs to move on to bigger and better things.",hgwejg

igbl6mq,None of these movies compare to Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke in 9-1/2 weeks.,hgwejg
ilikm4b,9 1/2 weeks was unbelievably hot.,hgwejg

fwjbpak,Totally agree with this. It’s the same perspective I have for the movie Passengers with Chris Pratt.,hgwejg
fykbfc0,">It’s the only thing that this movie gets right, because nothing else makes sense.

So gratuitous male nudity is ok but female nudity isn't?",hgwejg
fwb0dm4,"Yes it's so ridiculously stupid, nonsensical, and over the top it's very fun to watch with friends and make of fun while doing so.",hgwejg
fw8sxtj,"It elevated the cringefest experience for sure, having the male lead sing those songs...",hgwejg
fwrlk5h,There isn’t anything bad about The Room.,hgwejg
gegbyba,More like Wattpad-level badly written teenage fantasy Hermione/Voldemort,hgwejg
fw8vq52,"I can. Shame. Although I don’t have to imagine it because I did. 0/10, do not recommend.",hgwejg
hleiihc,"I was going to say the same thing. I think it's mostly that sex scenes in movies tend to be ""cleaner"", and the male actors tend to be better looking than the average porn actor. Yo don't see much male nudity in movies so when it happens it gets more attention. Most of those movies are made to appeal women with a story that tend to lead to sex, even though, in an age of feminism, obviously most women roll eyes to stories with such sexist takes, and prefer real sex or porn.

While it's not cup of tea, there's room for erotic movies. I would only wish that they stopped with such offensive stories, but well..  it's fantasy and there's people who fantasize with it.",hgwejg
fw7x1ge,Yeah it's kind of enjoyable... It's far more enjoyable than Artemis Fowl,hgwejg
igbko2x,"Me too! I pictured him with someone else, not to say she's not good looking, but something is off.",hgwejg
fwqk1il,Italians/ Poles speaking English. It’s all very cringe,hgwejg
fykbukp,"Gratuitous female nudity has been relatively commonplace over the years, gratuitous male nudity has not. Gratuitous female nudity is almost always meant to be sexual, gratuitous male nudity is almost always meant to be comical. So to have a mainstream movie where the audience is meant to ogle a man’s body throughout the whole running time... that’s unusual.",hgwejg
fzdyq1z,Do you get paid to be obnoxious?,hgwejg
fw8x0sb,That was fantastic,hgwejg
fwrq745,Touché,hgwejg
fykcp7r,"The implication is that its ok to objectify men. Like, the man here doesn't have any reason to be constantly naked.  Why would objectifying him be the only thing good about this movie?",hgwejg
fykd7o4,"So after decades of women being objectified in cinema, you’re bothered that it’s happening to a man in one terrible movie?",hgwejg
fykdjbv,"Why does women being objectified justify men being objectified? This whole ""eye for an eye"" thing isn't helpful.",hgwejg
fykdcsi,Happy Cake Day!,hgwejg
