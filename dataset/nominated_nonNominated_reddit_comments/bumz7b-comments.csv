epkku8m,"I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!

Taron Egerton is amazing as Elton John.  His singing is incredible.  The film isn't afraid to show the darker parts of Elton's life.  The song performances are fantastical and dreamlike. 

It's everything I wanted Bohemian Rhapsody to be.",bumz7b
epktfff,"I think what separates Rocketman from Bohemian Rhapsody is that Elton is still here to tell his story. 

I loved how authentic it felt, how Elton was not the hero the whole story and he was incredibly honest about his life. He said before the movie premiered that he wouldn’t tone down the sex and drugs and I think the film would have suffered greatly if it had. The drugs were not glorified and they were not shown in a positive life. 

Overall, I rated this my top movie of the year and I hope it wins all the awards next year. 9.5/10",bumz7b

eppkmn1,"I get the feeling the approach this film takes is something you're either on board with, or you're not.  
  
I absolutely loved it. Not really an Elton John fan (don't get me wrong, like the songs I've heard just never listened to that much) but I was absolutely on board for the ride. It gave a jolt in the arm to the tired music-biopic format. The fantasy elements were used to great effect. Take the scene where everyone levitates during his first performance. It shows the effect he had much more than just a straight song performance could. It really helped to show us who Elton is, more than just re-enactments of things he did.  
  
To repeat everyone else, Taron is fantastic. Really helps to let the actor actually sing rather than mime, it frees him up so much. Jamie Bell is as great as ever. Richard Madden, Bryce Dallas Howard, Steven Graham. Loved the cast.  
  
It does however further denigrate Bohemian Rhapsody in my eyes. Can you even imagine how amazing a Queen film would've been if they'd had the balls (figurative and literal) that this film had? If they just went for it, rather than having band members accidentally come up with classic songs that Rami Malek then mimes. The extremes this film goes to only serves to further show how safe Bo Rhap played it. It's such a wasted opportunity.  
  
But blessed are we, for Rocketman was not such a waste. Do yourself a favour. And try not to get out of your seat and start dancing during the Saturday Night's Alright scene.",bumz7b

epnszq5,"The fact that his big showdown with the people who caused him pain in life was him facing them down as figments of his imagination was surprisingly moving, and I think it better reflects the real man than if he went and talked to all of the people in person. The moment where he hugged his younger self was quick but incredibly effective. The big resolution wasn’t him showing his demons who was boss, but learning to love himself. It was incredibly moving. Just about every person near me in the theatre was crying, including myself.",bumz7b

eq838gg,"The scene where his boyhood version asks Elton ""when are you going to hug me?"" was honestly one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. Liked the movie but loved this. 

So many people in life could benefit from embracing the hardships of their childhood and showing themselves love. It spoke to me.",bumz7b
epkj3gv,"One of my favorite parts of this movie was how ""gay-positive"" it was. Bohemian Rhapsody really didn't portray Freddie's sexuality in a great light: his first encounter with a man is in a seedy truck stop, his hetero love interest was his final saving grace, etc. It really made it seem like everything bad in Freddie_s life was due to his being gay. 

Rocketman really shows it differently. The sex scenes aren't shown as morally corrupt, but rather the same as any sexual relationship anyone has. His issues come from his decadent and self-destructive lifestyle, and his sexuality isn't the root cause of that.",bumz7b
epkaavv,"Strange how Taron Egerton has covered ""I'm Still Standing"" 2 times for 2 different movies",bumz7b
epkrl4c,"This movie. THIS FUCKING MOVIE. 

It was perfect. I know is not a perfect movie, but with my bias I’m gonna give it a perfect 10/10. This is how you do a jukebox musical. Some highlights:

1. Rocketman, man this number was awesome. I love the transition from the pool to the hospital to the baseball outfit. Easily one of the best performance of the movie.

2. When Elton is practicing his smile and then goes out and starts playing the piano, and the scene is just spinning. I love how the mark his downward spiral. Perfectly done. 

3. When young Elton started signing Saturday Night’s Alright (for fighting). At first I thought, “man, they must be crazy to waste this song like this” but soon enough Taron Elton appeared and it was so well done. 

4. When Sorry seems to be the hardest word stars palming in the background in that breakfast with his wife, and then continues through the dinner with his mom and Bernie. 

5. Like how he started rehab with the devil’s outfit, and little by little Elton gets undressed to, show us the passage of time, and that he’s becoming more vulnerable. 

6. Speaking of rehab. I like how the final confrontation with all of his demons were done in front of the other people in rehab, and they didn’t fade to the background just leaving Elton and the people he needed to confront. It probably wasn’t the intention of the scene, but I took it as his life not being really private, he is a public figure, after all.",bumz7b
epk611t,I said this in the advanced screening thread and I need to say it again. I feel the biggest reason I liked this movie was that they never showed drugs and alcohol wasn’t cool about it. You saw him struggling and the part that hit me the most was when he was having breakfast and he fills half his cup with vodka and the rest with oj and you see the look on his wife’s face and it really feels like he know his life is a mess. It really showed with what he has has been fighting for and his causes. I feel he was really trying to let people know not to end up like him and get help. I also loved the end where they ended with I’m still standing it was perfect.,bumz7b
epms409,"It's frustrating that the mediocre *Bohemian Rhapsody* came out last year to such a high level of both praise and criticism. I makes me worried that there'll be a backlash against this film (or simply a lack of interest) for arriving in *BR*'s shadow, even though this is the far superior film.",bumz7b
epvzm5r,"This movie is basically a mix of what Bohemian Rhapsody should have been and what The Greatest Showman should have been.

Like Bohemian Rhapsody, it's a musical biopic about the rise and fall and rise again of a famous musician. But unlike Borap, it doesn't downplay Freddie's raunchier moments by implying they happened or showing them about to happen like Borap did, it actually shows Elton sniffing cocaine or participating in orgies. And, like The Greatest Showman, it's a musical fantasy about a real person that tries to be ""progressive"" but it didn't work there because The Greatest Showman kept saying ""don't judge people for their looks"" while refusing to give the circus troupe any screen time other than to establish how they were mistreated and focused exclusively on P.T. Barnum while this movie focuses entirely on Elton John, a homosexual man, and, unlike the ""freaks"" in TGS, he has more of a character than just being gay.",bumz7b
er8oe10,"So, I’ve seen this twice already, and I may be seeing it a third time tonight. The writing is fairly predictable and sometimes cheesy, but the acting and the way it’s filmed elevate it. I started out thinking, “yeah, pretty good,” and as days passed, the movie just sunk under my skin more and more.

I’m a little obsessed. 

As a queer person, I have to say that this film satisfied me in a way Bohemian Rhapsody very much did not. It felt far more authentic, not just because of the sex scenes (though I’m glad they were included), but because of some of the emotional aspects.

When you grow up in a homophobic society, intimacy issues and feelings of deep isolation are super common. I certainly dealt with this, and I grew up in a kinder world than Elton. The story of a “late bloomer” taking decades to finally understand and accept himself felt like the other piece of the puzzle when telling a gay man’s story. The story of someone learning to be loved when you’ve known all your life that was off limits to you.

I really needed to see this story told! I didn’t expect it to hit me so hard, to feel so seen.

And yes, Taron Egerton is incredible. He deserves the accolades.",bumz7b
eq147k8,Damn they didn't have to dunk on Bohemian Rhapsody that hard.,bumz7b
epy3avj,"I absolutely loved the shots of Elton flying into rehab in the devil costume. Those little detail shots of the feathers and such falling away, just excellent cinematography.

I also thought that the young Eltons were surprisingly excellent. The ""middle"" (10-12 maybe) actor was especially great.

Taron was phenomenal and unless this was some kind of fluke he has some VERY good years ahead of him.",bumz7b
eplkiy3,"Saw this a few weeks back here in the UK and absolutely fucking loved it. I honestly didnt expect it to be as musical as it is, I expected more biopic like BR, but it really worked well. For me this was Taron Egertons breakout performance. Dont get me wrong he was good in Kingsman but this was the movie that made me think he was really fucking good and an awards contender. The editing was great, I loved the supporting cast and as expected the songs were incredible. Its pretty easy to compare to BR but this film did the musical biopic so so much better. Finally, the scene I liked the most was when he went to see his dad again and his dad had the two kids and he seemed like a good father. That hurt like shit and Taron Egerton and Steven Mackintosh were fantastic. 9/10, maybe even 10/10 on rewatch",bumz7b
epprqv4,"Really quite a special film. Some incredible cinematography, not to mention the costumes, choreography and the singing itself. The whole film is really a testament to Taron's talents. If Rami deserves an Oscar for Bohemian Rhapsody, Taron deserves 1000.

Also, to be able to re-contextualize an man's entire discography to fit his life story is quite an achievement - the uses of Rocket Man, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and I'm Still Standing in particular were awesome in that regard, but also the scenes with Bennie and the Jets And Saturday Night's Alright were incredibly done.

Solid 8/10, best biopic since Love and Mercy.",bumz7b

et7muv9,"I was never all that into Elton John, but my Dad really wanted to see this movie so I decided what the hell, I’ll go with him. I was blown away by how much I liked it! I’ve been humming/whistling/singing all the songs the last few days since seeing it, and it made me start listening to some of his other stuff too. Taron Egerton was phenomenal in this role! It really made me angry seeing how much Elton had to go through just because he was gay, and how afraid he was that people wouldn’t accept him. The scene when he’s an adult and visits his Dad and sees how loving and playful he is with his new kids, was fucking heartbreaking. You spend your life thinking someone is incapable of love, only to realize that no, he *can* love but he just didn’t love *me.*",bumz7b
es1yxot,I’m an alcoholic. I totaled my brand new car & got a DWI Friday. As soon as I was released from jail I went to see this movie. It hit me very very hard. It depicted addiction incredibly well. I’m checking myself into rehab tomorrow partly because of this movie. So thank you to Elton John & everyone involved in this beautiful film. It may factor into saving my life.,bumz7b
eple659,"I didn't expect to like it as much as I did because apart from La La Land, I don't really like musicals. Plus, I'd seen Aladdin last week which reminded me why I avoid musicals. But then I saw Rocketman and realized, I do like musicals, just the ones that are done well.",bumz7b
epk5hvj,"Well, I fucking loved this movie. It's just incredible. I am, admittedly, a huge Elton John stan. There's all sorts of bands and singer/songwriters to love and they're all great, but Elton was the dude who lived in my CD player during my 45 minute commutes in high school. I wore his greatest hits album out, I saw him live a few years ago and it was one of the best nights of my life, I have fond memories of singing Levon with my dad and Daniel with my mom. So that's where I'm coming from, but this movie is so good I think anyone with a passing familiarity would probably enjoy it. I have a lot to say so let's get into it.

First off, let's get the obvious out of the way. This movie shits all over Bohemian Rhapsody. They are different movies, but the comparison is obvious and it's going to pop up a lot. The director of Rocketman is also the guy who was brought in to finish Bohemian when Bryan Singer had to flee the country due to being a huge creep and most likely a pedophile. Bohemian was also the highest grossing biopic of all time and went on to win Oscars for some reason. And sure, who doesn't love Queen, but in comparison that movie is bland as fuck. All of the songs are used to either fade into a scene or just show them on stage playing it. Compare that to Rocketman which is basically an Across the Universe type musical where the songs are helping tell the story and we are getting beautiful sequences and choreography. I don't think there was a single aspect of Rocketman that didn't blow Bohemian out of the water. Anyways, I don't want to spend the whole time comparing the two, I just wanted to mention the obvious.

This movie is beautiful and moving and just a joy to watch. I was completely in from the first scene. Where he busts into rehab in the devil outfit and starts talking about himself. He gives that lip bite/tooth gap smile and I was like holy shit that's Elton. And then it cuts to him as a kid singing The Bitch is Back and I just thought this is so perfect. I loved how his family dynamic was portrayed, and I fell in love with the movie when they started singing I Want Love. And that's kind of the theme here, and it's so coherent. Usually biopics tend to go all over the place because over 30 years there's a lot to deal with and humans are very complex. The theme here was simple and well presented. Elton didn't get the love he wanted so badly as a child and it caused a huge hole in him he filled with drugs and sex and giving himself to the people. The scene where he goes to his dad as an adult and sees that his dad is a more loving and lenient father with his new kids was honestly heartbreaking. To see him do something so effortlessly that he could never do with you and still wouldn't. You can really understand why he was turning to the drugs and alcohol.

And yet, even though this is a classic excessive rock star story, it's not as cliche as it could have been. I loved how him and Bernie were always the most wholesome friends. You'd expect backstabbing or that classic THEY LOVE ME fight, and there's hints of it, but at the end of every scene they are still brothers. I loved how they depicted Your Song as being a gift from Bernie to Elton to make him the star, and in turn the music was Elton's gift to Bernie to bring them their success. It was such an amazing scene watching him write it and watching everyone in the studio just jaw drop listening to it. I think my favorite scene between them was when Bernie suggested being more himself and Elton screamed at him, goes to go on stage, then stops and says I'm sorry. And Bernie says I know. And you just understand that they'll never hate each other. And then he goes on and sings Pinball Wizard which was this great metaphor for someone being so talented yet so unable to function normally. 

The movie wasn't perfect, as most movies are not. It was kind of weird that Bryce Dallas Howard played his mom, right? Like she did great, but you really never see Americans play Brits, or at least not as commonly as you see Brits play Americans. I also thought it was really weird that they spent all of four minutes on an entire marriage and divorce. Plus that seemed like a perfect place for my favorite Elton song, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, so I was kind of bummed we didn't get that. In the last half an hour things started to move a little weird in general and I was wondering how it could end, but I have to admit the ending of him going to rehab and where he confronts all the people of his life in that room was so fucking powerful it almost made up for it. 

I absolutely loved that this entire movie took place as he told his story in rehab. It's such an important part of the rock star experience, what you learn about yourself when you start to sober up and I feel like rehab is always treated like something temporary or just something they have to do for PR. But in this movie it caused the happy ending, and it's so much happier because it's real. To imagine it could have all spiraled out of control before I was even old enough to be a fan is heartbreaking. But he's out there living his best life and thinking about that just makes me so happy.

Now, if you'll indulge me, here's some bullet points of things I loved:

 • I loved how Tiny Dancer was a solo because that's well known as a song you belt in a crowd thanks to Cameron Crowe. 

 • I loved the Rocketman scene starting in a pool. That was just so cool. And really any scene where he interacted with Young Elton. Especially the end where Young Elton said, ""When are you gonna hug me?"" 

 • I loved that they went there with the gay sex. Like, short of gratuitous thrusting from behind this is probably the most real gay sex I've seen in a movie this big and that's awesome. Because if it was a guy and a girl you know they'd want all those money shots, so giving it the same treatment was very cool to me.

 • I really liked the first manager. Like he could have easily been some huge prick but he kind of was actually just a very savvy and smart music business man. The second he saw that real magic Elton and Bernie had he gave them whatever they needed. No cliche, no arguments about the clothes or whatever. Managers in these movies always come off as bumbling idiots, and even though the second manager was a huge douche, both the managers were both still very smart.

 • Taron Eggerton fucking killed it. And not just him, every actor who played Elton knocked it out of the park. But this movie sits on Taron's shoulders and he held it up looking effortless. When it cut from young Elton to older Elton in Saturday Night's Alright I knew this was going to be a special performance. And putting him in the Still Standing video at the end was really, really cool.

 • I loved how they played the Crocodile Rock scene. I almost knew that song was coming because having seen him before that song brings down the fucking house. So when he started it I was like dope, and then they had this great moment where when the ""la la la la las"" come in it was like this transcendental moment and it was honestly perfect. 

 • So many other great musical scenes. Bennie and the Jets, Honky Cat, Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and every other song scene I've mentioned were just great. Hard to not watch this with a huge smile on your face.

Easy 9/10. Right up there with my favorites this year and I can't wait to see it again. Not only that, I can't wait to see it years down the road at sing alongs and belt this shit out. Been listening to the soundtrack non stop.",bumz7b
epp17c6,"Was a bit disappointed Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury didn't show up at the end to tell Elton ""I'm putting together a team, darling"". 

/s Overall 10/10 though.",bumz7b
epn8k79,"A shout out to the girl with the hula hoop. Not the girl who was spinning one, but the girl who was bashing a hula hoop against a tree. It was the perfect 70’s detail. The details in this movie are simply incredible.",bumz7b
epxg6ij,"If I had time travel powers, I'd grab all the people who were convinced Bohemian Raphsody was actually good last year and bring them to now to see this instead. I never understood how Bohemian Raphsody became an Oscar contender, and after seeing Rocketman, it's become even more nonsensical to me.

Seriously, this movie doesn't just trade on nostalgia to get people to think they like it. It's actually interested in the performer's life and work beyond the superficial, and finds ways to use their music to tell the story. Yeah, it's not 100% accurate or anything like that, but it let's you know right away that it isn't going to be by quickly displaying it's stylized version of events right at the beginning, as opposed to Bohemian Raphsody trying to pass itself off as a genuine retelling despite whitewashing things or outright fabricating them.

Also, Egerton is actually singing himself, rather than lipsynching like Bohemian Raphsody did.

Also, Crocodile Rock is the *best* Elton John song, and those who suggest otherwise are inviting violent rebuttals.",bumz7b
epkfiaj,"I'm going to be so triggered if Taron Egerton doesn't get nominated for Best Actor. He was phenomenal. He actually sang (great voice), the drug use was documented well and raw, the love scenes were passionate and bold, and he had that bussy right up front and center on the screen. None of which could be said for Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddie Mercury.

I hate to compare the 2, but Bohemian Rhapsody is the most recent comparable film, and Rocketman just absolute dominates it and accentuates just how fucking bland BR was.",bumz7b

epk7ej2,"Wow. Overall, this was amazing. Every song landed perfectly, without feeling like it was forced in to show you how the characters feel. It really pushed the story along very fluidly. 

Taron Egerton is an absolute star. I can't imagine anyone else doing a better job.

The relationships he had felt very genuine. He and Bernie were adorable. The scenes with Elton and John Reid really brought you along on their journey, from Elton falling in love with him, to eventually realizing he just wanted to be loved and it wasn't going to happen. You really felt that connection. The pain that he had from his father not loving him (and then so clearly loving his two new sons). His teetering relationship with his mother... all of it was amazing.

I will say, while the Honky-Cat scene was a phenomenal way of showing his transition into excess, the decent into addiction kind of lost me, because I've seen it a thousand times before in any other rock star biopic, but it's not like they could have just glazed over it so I can't really fault them.

The only part I really think I didn't like was him hugging his inner child. You can't get much more heavy handed than that.

eq2f7b3,"I loved this movie, Taron was phenomenal and believable as Elton. I think Taron is like Hugh Jackman, a great action movie star (although lacking the rawness of Jackman) and he can handle sensitive drama and he can sing well. They both seem like genuinely good people and I see a great future in store for Taron.

During Pinball Wizard he really looked like him at some points. In my opinion, Rocketman was much better than Bohemian Rhapsody in acting, the flow of the movie and I liked that this was a musical were the incorporated the songs into the plot. I hope Rocketman gets a lot of attention at the Oscars.",bumz7b
eq2njjv,"Everyone is comparing this to Bohemian Rhapsody, but since I haven't seen it I can't make that connection.  Instead, I'd rather compare this to The Dirt (Netflix film about Motley Crue).  Both subjects are still alive to oversee the production of their biopics, and I think that says a lot.

The Dirt completely romanticized drugs, alcohol, sex, and partying while glossing over the many negative things that came with Motley Crue.  Rocketman completely did the opposite, showing how these things destroyed Elton John's life.  

The endings were starkly different as well.  The Dirt had Motley Crue voice over and say ""we regret some things we did"" and show they were still all friends.  Rocketman showed how Elton John actually turned his life around.

This seemed a more real story and not just glorification of his rock star life style.",bumz7b

I like that Elton's flaws were not glossed over with all of his problems and the fact he treated some of his friends like Bernie later in the movie badly. It does edify a good message with how you have to learn to love yourself before you can love others as symbolized with him hugging his child version.

epsf867,"I saw it last night by myself. Going through a bit of a tough time and thought I'd treat myself to seeing a movie about the man whose music I listened to for pretty much 80% of my childhood (my parents are HUGE fans). I literally would play FFVII muted, in the living room while my parents played a bunch of his records. 

The movie was so beautiful. Elton seems like such an amazing person and I'm glad he/the filmmakers didn't hold back on showing his egotistical side and his scars. I didn't read too much about the film before going in, and I usually don't enjoy musicals, but this was so creatively done. I think my favorite scene in the entire film was when Bernie handed Elton the lyrics to Your Song, and as Elton starts writing the song he sings it directly to Bernie. I just loved everything about their friendship.",bumz7b
epsl0yb,"This movie is a trip and a half. It really shined as a musical and I think that's where it beats Bohemian Rhapsody. 

Also, as a hardcore Beatles fan and coming from /r/beatles, I was ecstatic when 

- Elton turns and sees John Lennon and The Beatles and says ""John"" as his last name.

- Giles Martin, George Martin's son makes a cameo (He helps produce the music in the movie).

- The ""Lennon-McCartney are inseparable"" line.

I also loved that they included Mowtown bands. They were instrumental for many artists like Elton and the Beatles.",bumz7b

ergi4cz,"So I’ve now seen this film three times. It just gets better and better on each watch. I watched lots of interviews with the cast and crew before I saw it the third time, and it made me appreciate the effort and skill that was put into this film. 

The underwater Rocketman scene? It was filmed completely under water. Taron had a diver on standby to give him oxygen between shots. He had to lie at a particular angle so the water wouldn’t go up his nose.

The last scene in the rehab where he starts singing I’m Still Standing? Taron did the choreography and vocal arrangement as nothing had been decided on yet. 

Taron’s voice? A lot of the singing was done live on set (Your Song, parts of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, I’m Still Standing). 

I also just by chance watched Kingsman 2 and Eddie the Eagle between watching Rocketman again, and boy that actor is talented. The fact he got rejected by all drama schools on first application, and then only one gave him a place on his second application a year later. I bet they all feel very silly now.

Edit: oh and it inspired me to start playing piano again. So on Saturday I spent £500 on a new piano. This film has proven costly to my bank account!!",bumz7b

They both laughed out loud for the first two songs and then they got up 10 minutes later and walked out leaving their reclining chairs fully extended and their food wrappers, popcorn and cups in the seats.

Only positive is that they left right when it turned to 20+ yr old Elton",bumz7b

eq40w41,"I think something this movie did very well was that it had a clear purpose. If it tried to go through every single big moment in Elton John's life (like the Lion King soundtrack, winning an oscar, getting knighted, Candle in the Wind at Dianna's funeral, etc.) it would have been too messy and rushed. Instead it focused on his struggle to accept who he is inside. It's a clear thread that has some big emotional moments like his conversations with his parents later in the film. Him signing the record for his dad's friend really got to me. It was focused and didn't try to do the entire birth to present day or death thing that biopics can sometimes do.

epkvw0y,"I really loved it.

I loved how they subverted the biopic cliché of starting with the “big concert”, with him dramatically opening the door in costume and then we find out it’s actually the real most important moment in the story - going to rehab.

I loved all of the musical sequences.
They were all fitting and creative, and Taron’s singing is so good.
 The whole rocketman sequence was especially breathtaking.

I loved the framing device that let them get away with some of the cheesier moments (picking the “John” part)

I loved how it was gay positive and didn’t show being gay as a sin that deserved punishment (ahem Bohemian AHEM).
Even though the “gay sex scene” that I heard so much about in the media lasted for 10 seconds.


When the movie is good, it’s really really good. I really wish Bohemian Raphsody was half as good and as eigth as creative.


The movie does sometimes falls on genre clichés, and some of the dialogue is bad, you can see that the movie has real heart and everyone gave their a game, especially Taron.


My mom was a bit sad though that they didn’t put her favorite song, Sacrifice, in.

Edit: 
some more things I forgot to mention:

- The edit of the ""I'm still standing"" music video in the end ... was not great. Taron did everything perfectly of course, but you could very very clearly see he was green screened in. They didn't degrade him to match to quality of the video. I'm honestly surprised they didn't just reshot it.

- I really wish John Reid got a bit more depth in the end. I didn't like that they ended it with ""You're incapable of love"". I don't know the story IRL, but even in the movie it seems that it was at least partially Elton's fault for the mess of the relationship. I think they could have fleshed him out a bit more instead of turning him into a generic villain.

- The ending text felt very much out of place. After the emotional ending the ""still shopaholic"" thing fell completely flat at least for me. 
And the AIDS charity he has I'm sure is amazing, but really just isn't relevant to the movie, like Elton required it to be there.

- The coming out to his mom scene was really well done. 
That moment of relief when you think he is getting acceptance, and then replaced by the crushing disappointment. Like I know that this is a standard scene in this type of movie, but the way it was written and acted was just perfect to me and I think it deserves a mention.",bumz7b

eppflcn,"I don’t even know where to begin with my review! I saw it for the first time on its release day in the UK (22nd), and I wasn’t too fussed about going to see it. I like Elton’s music, but I wasn’t as hyped going into it as I was for Bohemian Rhapsody. But boy did I end up enjoying it a hell of a lot more than BR!!! 

The next day I just sat with Elton on shuffle, and then the official soundtrack on shuffle when it was released a couple of days afterwards. Taron’s voice is incredible! 

Over the days following, I decided to get my old keyboard out and started to learn some of the songs. I used to play as a child, and the film and the music inspired me to start playing again! It’s got the point now where I’m about to splash out £450 on a nice digital piano as my keyboard isn’t enough! 

I went to go see it again less than a week later,  and it was even better second time around. I saw detail I had missed on the first viewing, and had a greater appreciation of the music. I also didn’t realise on first viewing that Taron was doing all the vocal work, so it was nice to watch it again with that knowledge.

My favourite scenes are the transition from young to teenage Elton during Saturday Nights Alright. I’ve recently read that Taron doesn’t think he can dance well at all, but I thought it was perfect! I also loved the creation of Your Song. The fact is was a live vocal as well made it that extra special. I also enjoyed the loop from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road at the start and then again at the end when he is walking into Rehab 

The scenes are beautifully shot, the music numbers are fantastic and the on screen character relationships feel so real. I loved the way they approached the taboo topics, with the drug usage being obvious but not over the top, and the sex scene being so tender yet raw. As Elton said, he didn’t live a PG-13 life! 

The acting is phenomenal, and if Taron doesn’t get a nod at the Oscars I will be astounded. What an incredible performance. 

I’m hoping to go a third time, but if I can’t, I’ve already preordered it in 4K!

The writing is really good, effortlessly blending Elton's songs into his life as if they were written specifically for the purpose of the movie. The score and soundtrack become indistinguishable.

epwl6om,"Rocketman fires on all cylinders. As a biopic it is a harsh look at the beginnings of Elton John and as a musical it's a rocking spectacle. The movie is phenomenally directed, especially during the musical numbers. The writing is sharp and very relatable, it truly feels like John's soul is being laid out for us (for better or worse). The songs are greatly chosen to fit the story and are sung phenomenally by the cast. And the acting is award worthy across the board, from Egerton's star making performance as Elton John to Bryce Dallas Howard's unrecognizable performance as Elton John's mother and everyone else in between is on their A-game here, giving the best performances of their career. Despite having a fantasy musical element to it, Rocketman is brutally honest about John's addiction and downward spiral, making it feel real even at it's most fantastical. Outside of nit-picks, I honestly feel that there's nothing wrong with this movie, it's that brilliantly done. If this isn't a big awards contender, then the Oscars are a bigger joke than I thought.

Rocketman cements itself as a unique musician biopic and movie musical. Both are done flawlessly and is the best of its respective genres. There's no comparison to Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman kicks its ass in all aspects. One of the best movie musicals in years (and I say that as someone who has loved several modern musicals) and one the best biopics in years. Highly recommend this masterpiece.

Moments I teared up: Your Song and at the end when young Elton said, ""When are you going to hug me?"" There were others but those stood out the most to me.

Performances by Taron Egerton and Jamie Bell are great. I adored their friendship. The cinematography was beautiful. The musical numbers were a ton of fun. I love how the director blends fantasy into the story, and it isn’t just a simple retelling of the events. 

I’m probably alone in this, but I was really surprised with how dark this story got. I'm not super familiar with Elton John, so I didn't know just how depressing aspects of his story were. It hit me harder than I was was expecting. I started crying halfway through the movie, and I didn’t stop until it finished. I hid my head in my partner's shoulder at one point because I was so embarrassed by my reaction.

eqtjv5u,"I remember seeing one of those ""behind the music"" type documentaries on the making of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", but apart from that I didn't really know a lot about Elton John.

I knew his name was Reggie... something, when he came out as gay everyone was like ""no durr"", he was in giant shoes in Tommy, and that was one of his least flamboyant outfits, he at least used to hate his mum, and re-wrote Marilyn Munro's song for Princess Di.

I did really enjoy the movie, and Taron Egerton knocked it out of Dodger's Stadium with his performance and singing.  Apparently Elton John wanted Justin Timberlake to take the role.  I think that could have worked really well, but anyway.

The film really felt like it was set in it's time period, and inclusions of fairly faithful renditions of characters like Dick James really built the world.

With Elton John being so closely involved in the story, he didn't stray too much into the making himself look great.  I wouldn't call it ""warts and all"", maybe ""tarnish and all"".  This is most obvious in the complete glossing over of his marriage to... that woman... Renate Blauel

A full on gay sex scene in a major Hollywood film is a refreshing break.  Good on them for showing it.

Where the movie kind of fell flat was that it was ""too real"".  There were complaints about ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" for not being accurate to real life.  Here's the thing.  Real life doesn't often make for real good story telling.  

Rocketman had an interesting climax then... went no where.

eqp26jk,"For context, I enjoy Elton John's music quite a bit, but I'm not super knowledgeable about his career or his music beyond the biggest of the hits.  With that in mind I enjoyed this movie a lot.

What I liked: Taron Egerton is great as Elton, and Jamie Bell kills it as Bernie as well.  I hope that the Academy keeps Egerton in mind when Oscar season rolls around, but I don't have a ton of faith that it will. The music was obviously great. I liked the way this movie was stylized in comparison to other music biopics. Slightly petty, but I like that it ended with I'm Still Standing, which has always been my favorite Elton John song.

What I didn't like: I could have used like 10 minutes less of child Elton. And I thought that Elton's mother wasn't written particularly well.  Because of those two things, the emotional beats of the ""forgive yourself"" part at the end didn't really hit for me. 

This was my introduction to quite a few Elton John songs, and one of my big takeaways coming out of the movie was that I wish I had been more familiar with his catalog. Overall it's a 4/5 for me. I think we're going to get a classic rock biopic basically every six months for the foreseeable future, and I thought this was a much better example of the genre than *Bohemian Rhapsody*.",bumz7b

Costume design is very top notch, it's amazing how same they are with real Elton's! But yea, roller coaster of feels, was cheering/feeling sad during certain scenes.

I admit I'm not a huge Elton John fan, but the way this biopic was handled kept me engaged and interested from start to finish compared to other biopics (Straight Outta Compton, Bohemian Rhapsody, etc.) that pretty much went through the motions that every music biopic seems to do.

epkgucr,"I’ve been trying to figure out how to articulate why I liked this movie more than Bohemian Rhapsody and I think it comes down how each movies deals with their central character. 

I feel like one of the more problematic elements of Rhapsody’s storytelling is they way that Queen’s music is used throughout the film. The film sort of suggests that the audience should look past Mercury’s selfish behavior because the rock music he produces (however good it might be) ultimately redeems his negative traits. 

Rocketman seems to want to do the opposite. Sure it features Elton’s music and has no problem showing its popularity and appeal. Ultimately though, this movie is about a broken man coming to terms with the concepts of self-care and love. When Elton does something negative Rocketman doesn’t use his hits and career milestones as a shield. Instead, it chooses to reflect on Elton’s struggles and his songs almost become a sort of Rorschach Test for his emotional state of mind.  

But those are just my initial thoughts. I really want to see this movie again just to digest everything that is there. And maybe I can approach this topic a little bit more critically.",bumz7b

His Nan gave him hope the way my nans did in the absence of a true relationship with my parents. Hit right home. I'm having a hard time even writing this without becoming overcome by emotion. His near-death struck my heart as I can relate with his reasoning down to nearly every last detail, and how they incorporated the titular song during these scenes gave me much pause.

Edit (accidently hit post prematurely):

I was one of six people in the room for this movie (rural town) and there was an elderly couple who had gotten in for free and fucking yapped LOUDLY for the ENTIRE MOVIE. The man went to the bathroom (the only peace I got during that movie) and came back only to forget where he was sitting. He came up to where my girlfriend and I were sitting, asked if we knew where his wife was, and unnecessarily squeezed passed us only to trip on my long legs, which I was trying to keep out of the way but REALLY. 

It's now one of my favorite movies ever produced, although I had an awful time watching it. I want my own private theater now.",bumz7b
erw0wjw,"Loved this movie. Such a great time in the theater, and they made the introverted person trying to party and be something they’re not relatable for myself and I imagine many others, even taking away the sexuality, fame, family issues.

My one disagreement with all of the reviews I’ve seen is that it showed Elton “warts and all.” I feel that he was pretty clearly the victim in this movie and never really acted that unreasonably aside from a couple times with Bernie. It was basically a movie about a talented kid who got fucked over by everyone he loved and became an addict for it. Maybe that was the real story, but I didn’t feel it put Elton in a bad light at any point. Was always rooting for him.",bumz7b
erdjizt,"Really well made biopic with some cool surreal elements and a great performance from Taron Egerton.

I think it definitely gets a little cheesy at moments, it's maybe a little too long and it pretty much follows every musical biopic trope in the book. But it's really competently made. The choreography, sets and costumes, and the filmmaking are all top notch.

Taron Egerton sang every song in this and it's just super impressive. Dude killed it. Also made me remember Elton has some straight up bangers, dude can write a song. The supporting cast I think was largely forgettable (I think Bryce Dallas Howard was just straight up bad) but Taron's performance just makes up for all this.

The surreal parts reminded me so much of the film Tommy (a movie the REAL Elton John is actually in, so maybe this isn't a coincidence).

Also, Elton John was gay?! 

;)",bumz7b
eqsfa60,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. My mom loved Elton John so I grew up listening to him, so I loved watching essentially a musical biopic with songs I already know I like. It's nice seeing a look on a musician that needed support in more ways than just generic motivation. Portraying how important his lyrics writer was was refreshing to me. I think it had a good balance of a showcase of the good and bad moments of his life without whitewashing or being too bleak.

Taron's performance was great. I feel like the two actors they got to play younger Elton got picked on looks first and acting second, but it really picked up for me once Taron came in. He was able to sell 10-20 years of a man's career in one movie, and was on par with Rami Malek's performance. He really sold Elton's stage presence, and the costume design was excellent. The Pinball Wizard montage and the I'm Still Standing video were very well done.

I haven't felt like this leaving a theater since...*Birdman*?  *Fury Road*, maybe?  

A lot of that hinges on Taron Edgerton and the wild, frenetic energy he brings to the performance.  This is the kind of film that rises and falls on the strength of its lead, and Edgerton sends it into orbit.  His star has been rising as of late, but this is the kind of titanic, career-defining, tour de force performance that we only get every few years, and he absolutely deserves to be at the fore of the discussion come awards season.",bumz7b

The film totally had me with it's opening musical numbers, particularly the Saturday scene all the way up to when he first performed at Troubadour, but then the film just went on a really tonal downward spiral. Obviously, this was Elton's life and I don't want to disrespect what he went through, but the film really oddly is joyful and then inverts into something really somber. And for all the build-up, the climax was really abrupt and unfulfilling. Frankly, it didn't even feel like a climax at all. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not complaining that the film was darker, but the pacing went from energetic, brisk, and fun to something pretty slow and dramatic, and I felt that. But then again, it's hard for a film like this to find room to breathe. I don't think you can fit many fun moments within all the drugs and drinking, so I realize the irony in my criticism, but it was definitely tonal whiplash and I don't think I would view this again past music videos on YouTube or something. Something about the pacing felt off during his downward spiral as well, so I don't even really know if that portion was all that compelling. Can't put my finger on what felt off, though.",bumz7b

The film immediately allows the audience to relax and not get caught up in the biographical details, unlike 'Rhapsody"" which wants it's audience to believe its a direct historical document despite its horrendous falsehoods. I like that they took a more fantastical approach. 
However there were a lot of things not to like about the film, lots of corny musical biopic moments (for a second i actually thought Elton was gonna rip out the sink...just like in 'Walk Hard'). I always hate scenes were something dramatic happens and then the main character is suddenly on the first attempt able to write a ground breaking song (Don't let the sun go down on me)..and overrall despite Elton himself talking about how he wanted an accurate portrayal and they didn't want to sugarcoat anything..it still had the feeling like this was a story for Elton and not necessarily about him. I could almost feel his influence coming through the screen. Not as heavy handed as Queen's influence on their movie but yeah..still there.

epmm01z,"Will be going to see the movie this weekend. My partner, is not a big fan of movie theatres, and he considers this movie a ‘wait and watch at home’ movie and not a ‘go out and spend money’ movie. 

He doesn’t know, how big, of an Elton fan, I am. I guess I hid it from him a little. 

It was the early 2000’s,  I was 17 years old, I was forced to listen to every single Elton John record multiple times. Because ...there was a radio competition at the time, they played a 10 second part of an Elton song, and if you guessed it - you won money, and each week they would increase the pot until it got to $5,000. A close family friend had every Elton John record. On vinyl record, I had a record player and spent many, many, many, many hours listening to Elton John songs over and over. To try and win the $5000.

I didn’t win it. BUT, I can however sing along to like...all the Elton. I can’t wait to watch the movie.",bumz7b

There's been so many cliche, empty 'it gets better'-kind of campaigns and movies, but this movie wasn't that at all.

And to add to that, the film itself had such a great balance of vibrant, glittering colour and solemn, emotional moments. It wasn't perfect, falling into some of the typical music biopic tropes, but holy hell, I really did love this movie and appreciate it for being unique in a way that feels very true to Elton - his career and his spirit.

Elton “blasting off”, some of the spinning CGI was not that great. But god damn did taron kill it and i still had a great time watching it. I gave it a 6.5/10. Had a friend who worked on the marketing and my love of the cast made me really want to see this movie succeed. I spent the time in between viewings immersing myself in Elton and the soundtrack and the labor of love that this movie is. Went back today to watch it again and i was blown away. I could watch this movie time and time again. Knowing more of the songs and the struggle Elton went through took me to different places. I cried in scenes, appreciated the scenes i didn’t like and when my favorite scenes were about to start (Saturday night and crocodile rock), i got downright giddy. I changed my rating to 9.5/10.

JOHN REID (Richard Madden) was just a complete non stop monster the whole time.  Was that what he was really like?  Was Elton ever the monster to him?

My nod has to go to INXS it could probably be one of the better biopics to come out if done correctly, young aussie band with a super charismatic frontman rise to the very top of the music industry and it all comes crumbling down due to Hutchence's self destruction and head injury. 

Could just imagine how epic the Wembley scene could be and just seeing a rise of a band get to the very top with Kick and X and self destruct within would be incredible to see on film. 

The whole recording of Full Moon Dirty Hearts would be incredible to see this is where INXS really started to fade in song writing and chart success and the recording sessions were apparently hostile as fuck between Michael and the rest of the band. 

Then the release of Elegantly Wasted when it looks like the band could be approaching a second wind with a huge tour in Australia their home country ready to kick off Michael sadly dies

eplilnz,"Rocketman is a fun biopic Musical/Fantasy movie that follows Elton John throughout his early years learning the ropes and gaining fame to become one of the biggest pop stars of all-time. It's not quite your average ""Biopic"" movie though. Rocketman features many of Elton's songs that are played relevant to the movie scenes and filled with stylish visuals and sounds that brings the legend to life. It feels like you are watching a theatre show live in places and gives the film an extra oomph to the whole picture. Played brilliantly by Taron Egerton, the movie delivers an emotional ride through the ups and downs of Elton's life and how you see him connect and develop with other people, as well as his own personal problems.

Unlike last year's Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman thankfully does not sanitize Elton's issues and you see him get into drugs, alcohol, and homosexuality factors that give the character a real sense of depth and dimension to him. The movie is nicely shot and acted, as well as having very high production values in pretty much every category. All the singing feels natural and nothing feels too out of place. There is clearly alot of effort put into this film and if your a fan of Elton John's music, then you'll definitely get a bigger kick out of this than someone who wouldn't. However, I think on the story side of things this movie still works and doesn't need nostalgia or fan-service to coast on its success. Rocketman is worth the stars of admission! 7/10",bumz7b

eqqws88,"Slightly mixed review from me. It follows the now becoming tired musical biopic formula. Start with the star at the end of their journey contemplating their entire life, flashback to them as a child experiencing some sort of deep disappointment or tragedy, show the eureka moment where they realize they have talent, show the star create an iconic hit song in seconds, show the moment of discovery, show the rise to fame, show the excess, show the complications with booze/drugs/women/men, show the star pushing loved ones away, show rock bottom, show the moment where they decide to right the ship, show the happily ever after. It's all there and it's been done and done and done. But, as far as formulas go, at least they had fun with it. Egerton is fantastic as Elton although I don't think his singing is quite at a high enough level. I can't see myself being excited to listen to this soundtrack whereas I have with others. But other than that, I found it immensely enjoyable. Couple slower moments, but lots of fun moments. And again, Egerton is fantastic. 8/10. If you are a fan of Elton you will enjoy it.",bumz7b

eqdm0qr,"Overall I was very disappointed with this movie, it felt like Elton had wrote the story and used his position to praise those he wanted to praise, and villainize others, it almost felt like a personal attack which was very one sided. The story pacing felt way off and some of the moments meant to be meaningful or touching just made me roll my eyes...for example the hug at the end and the levitation bit...overdone and I felt, with the latter mentioned part there, the effect was already achieved by the crowd/performance at the venue. 

Some positive parts certainly, I thought it’s openness about key parts of Elton’s character and personality...homosexuality and drug abuse for example, strength of the rehab and it’s changing qualities for Elton were great. Also some superb moments like when he is playing your song for the first time, however those scenes were interspersed with long periods where the story got lost along with any real development of the people in it beyond ‘this person was nasty to me’. 

For me it sadly just didn’t feel right and aside from a few lovely moments, it was only his relationship with Bernie that felt genuine.",bumz7b
epp70bv,"I feel bad because honestly I didn't really like the movie, but I fucking loved Taron Egerton's performance, he killed the role and at various points throughout the film I felt like he lost himself inside Elton John.

I really wanted to like this, but everything else just felt flat for me, his sexuality, drug abuse, parent issues, natural talent, rise to worldwide fame all felt like they were covered so fast, sometimes in a musical piece, so they couldn't be properly portrayed in the film.

The biggest example I can think of this is his marriage, he meets a girl in a studio, they exchange like 4 sentences, sing a musical piece, next thing is their wedding and right after that they're already divorced, I didn't even get her name until AFTER their divorce, how am I supposed to care about that? I don't know much about his life, maybe it was purposefully made so that you don't care about it that much, but most of the film felt this way for me.",bumz7b
eprz2ad,"Good movie, I really enjoyed it. There's always criticism that biopics or whatever this is are watered down a bit, but I'm not going to complain much about that. Songs were used well, the emphasis on the relationship with Bernie was great.

Overall worth the ticket price.",bumz7b
eq8hvba,"I wanted so badly to like it.  But I found it unbearably cheesy; the pacing was all over the place, and the trippy, allegorical visuals tried a bit too hard to ""wow"" me; I didn't really care about any of the ""characters,"" even Elton.  I know the scene where >!Elton hugs his younger self!< is supposed to be touching, but I found myself rolling my eyes.  I feel bad for that.

My theater was filled with really, really old women.  I didn't expect that, even taking into consideration the people who buy Elton John albums.  I found myself wondering how they took to the sex and drug scenes.  There was one woman in particular who had her *grandchildren* with her.  At least I assume they were grandchildren; the oldest was about 7, and the youngest couldn't have been older than 4.  Does nobody check the MPAA ratings anymore?  I can only imagine the conversations those three are having tonight!

epsjezn,"Ahhh I really was enjoying this for about the first third. The music was great and there were so many solid stylistic choices (the flashlight conducting, buying all the shit, rapid spinning piano to show Elton is going a little stir crazy from all the touring). But the pacing just became so awful, it's like they just started to rush through his life. Two choice examples:

One minute Elton meets Renate. A few seconds later they're getting married. A few seconds later they're estranged. A few seconds later they're divorced.

Elton suddenly changes his entire mentality and fixes all the problems the film has shown (which is maybe 90% of the movie) in the course of one song.

I just wish they gave these scenes and changes some time to breath and actually feel natural and not just occurring because the plot demands it. Made the movie such a bore to watch because things are just happening and I just kinda had to roll my eyes at it. Wish they had cut back on all the problems Elton faced and shown more of the recovery he went through to balance it out.",bumz7b
epsko08,"Has pacing issues and smashes you with its message but it mostly...works. A lot of it is the music (even if Taron Egerton struggles with some of the songs) and how dedicated and out there it is. Thank god Dexter Fletcher had the good sense to not do another Walk Hardesque movie biopic.

We are in the luxury recliners. This fat guy, one seat over, was humming and singing to the tunes before I had to shush him up. Later in the movie, he was actually snoring a couple times. Loudly. At one point, I got this incredibly disgusting waft of stinky feet or some shit, like wet socks and vinegar that was absolutely repulsive and made me gag.

Of course, at the end of the movie, he left all his shit and garbage in the chair.""

epp6to7,"As much as I like Taron Egerton and Jamie Bell, this movie is a 3/10 for me. The story is told through a lens of flamboyant embellishments designed to give importance to every moment of his life, with no subtleties. All supporting characters are one dimensional. It’s as if the movie could only have been written by Elton John because the ego this movie has could only be matched by the man himself.

There were so many disingenuous moments too. “Never had an argument”, like, did we not just watch you have an argument? And then the movie made it seem like the songs were just coming to Elton during various scenes when they’re also saying he didn’t even write the lyrics. The songs are being tied to moments in his life, but the man actually writing them is leading a relatively normal life. 

Maybe it is in the negatives of how the movie was written that we are supposed to see the faults of the real younger Elton John, since the movie was too shy to do it itself. This movie has not helped me connect to Elton at all - it feels like a facade, and I reacted similarly to how Bernie did when he comments on Elton’s stage outfits.

All this being said...it was better than Bohemian Rhapsody.

eqhh0uv,"Overall I enjoyed the movie, I thought that Taron was fantastic as Elton, both acting and singing wise. the rest of the cast had good acting too, although the kid who played the slightly older younger Elton kinda killed some scenes for me. I really enjoyed the editing in the movie, especially for the musical numbers, which I think sets it apart from other music biopics. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the story and pacing, which I thought did a disservice to Elton. My problem with the story/pacing in this (and music biopics in general) is that they crammed decades of his life into a two hour film, making it feel rushed, and the story hits the same beats most music biopics  have. I know that a lot of artist, including Elton, deal with substances abuse, depression and other problems, but because the movie follows the same basic formula as other music biopics (singer is well into their career and flashes back to their younger days, singer has disapproving parental figure and a approving one, singer blows everyone away at their first show and becomes a hit, a montage showing their rise to fame happens, singer starts doing drugs, drinking excessively and fucking everything that moves, singer passes out/almost dies, singer everyone they love away, singer decides to get better, and then before the credits roll there's a few images of the actually person saying hat happened to them after the events of the movie) it brings quality of a fantastic film down. But like I say in the being of this comment, overall I still really enjoyed the film.",bumz7b
epp44qf,"I was disappointed in the movie. I think the acting, directing, production was great, but I felt Elton's  story was very surface level. Maybe it was the musical format, but it left me wanting more. Even some of the events weren't biographically accurate. That is understandabke in these type of movies, but some of the creative liberties were ineffective and I think took away from the Elton John story. 

The movie starts with him in a therapy session, but all of the impactful life events/tramas seems to skim the surface. They skim his sexuality, they skim his relationships (love and family) and they really downplay who he is as a musician, no mention of him producing etc. The story felt like any normal Rockstar ballad. Could literally been replaced with any Rockstar character and been the same movie. Elton John is a legend, but I don't think the movie did his story  justice.

eppfefv,"""Rocketman"" is for Elton John fans first then for musical fans second. It's a delightful character piece that explores the emotion behind John's music and delivers a personal message about acceptance. Like Elton John's metaphorical flamboyant costumes throughout his career, the glitz and glam of the film hides the underlying pains. At times the film moves too fast through Elton's life. There is even a joke on how Elton has no idea where and when he is. A lot of important content feels either missing or intentionally left out of the film. Seeing that Elton John himself produced the movie, it can be assumed that the story shown was the one he felt comfortable with. Also, due to John's involvement, personal confrontations don't feel entirely honest. Maybe there would be a proper Elton John biopic in the future but right now audiences are left with a story from the personal perspective of the executive producer. 

What makes the movie work is the acting. Egerton, who's presence explains John's in Kingsman, exemplify John's persona(s) and single-handedly enraptures the audience into John's world. Jamie Bell is another standout actor in the movie. His on-screen chemistry with Egerton literally drives the plot because the movie will not work without the portrayal of John and Taupin's friendship. 

The directing, cinematography, and costume design are really well done. However, the editing was not entirely smooth. At times the film feels choppy, especially through those chronologically transitioning segments.

Overall, ""Rocketman"" is a good film with amazing acting by Egerton and an emotional message about acceptance. Should you see this in theaters? If you are an Elton John fan or like musicals, yes go and buy a ticket. Everyone else should simply wait for the movie's release on the cable music channel.",bumz7b
eruh91i,"This movie was pretty disappointing, I'm surprised at the acclaim for what feels like a pretty stereotypical Hollywood biopic. There's a very good movie in there, but instead it just descends into a predictable movie with characters that are as subtle as Elton's clothes. Best part is easily Taron who killed it, but everyone else fit cliche archetypes to be honest. It just feels so surface level in its depth 

It starts out a bit iffy, but It's got a great hook in the Saturday night scene and I was in, But it quickly fizzled away. It's so predictable, it hits every beat you'd expect it to hit in order and ends where you'd expect it to, at a breakneck pace that doesn't let the events sink in. He meets his wife, gets married and then divorced in legitimately 5 Fucking minutes. There's a brilliant scene of Elton writing 'your song' at home, but the director doesn't let it sink in and have that emotional pay off because it just cuts to him recording it. I wanted to see his family And Bernie's reactions FFS, and the film does stuff like this all the time.

And yes before you reply to me angrily I know that this was his actual life, but you can still create supporting characters with a bit more depth to them and scenes that feel more organically written, not just cliche caricatures telling us why x sucks.

There is so much cheesiness and Hollywood melodrama in this. Like the scenes with him looking back at his younger self or his family standing there talking to him was so cheesy to me, it's just such a lazy way to do character building. There's a lot of characters talking about who they are or what they are, it doesn't feel organic. It tries to be creative at parts, with some that work and some that don't work (the rocketman kid at the bottom of the pool made me laugh it was so silly) but undercutting all of this is an inability to create any supporting characters that feel rounded or have any depth. 

A lot of the musical sequences didn't work for me either, the songs just didn't work in the context of the scene and it took me out of scenes when characters randomly start auto tuned singing. Saturday night and Crocodile Rock were the best ones.

In the end, it did a good job trying to condense his eventful early life into 2 hours. If we want a full story of drama, love, loss, friendship, betrayal, etc from Elton's life, all the significant people that impacted him who did not make the cut for the movie, it would probably need a 10-episodes-mini-series on HBO to get through it all. 

Slightly sad that the movie went the opposite way to Bo Rhap and made him more unsympathetic than he is/was. Even at his worst, Elton was still a smart, funny, witty, loyal and passionate man who cared a lot about his fans and his craft. I know it is told from his perspective and he tends to vilify himself (he does that even now) but showing a little bit more of his good side would have been cool, so people know why he still has such loyal fans.

epvs62w,"Just got out of the cinema. Immediate thoughts: “Man, *Bohemian Rhapsody* was a good movie.”

Seriously, I can’t quite pin down my overall impression of *Rocketman*. It’s a mix of moments of genuine brilliance and utter trash.

EDIT: Since I'm being downvoted to shit for this I might as well elaborate on what I think:

Strip away the musical numbers and the weird imagery, and despite what everyone's saying about how amazingly original it is the core of *Rocketman* is just as conventional a biopic as *Bohemian Rhapsody* if not more so. It takes just as many liberties with history, and doesn't even try for nuance. Real people like Elton's parents and John Reid are depicted as moustache-twirling villains. There's no indication that Elton's understanding of his own sexuality might have evolved over time (did you know he came out publicly as bisexual in the mid-70s? because the movie certainly wouldn't let you know). Potentially interesting parts of his life, such as the backstory behind ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"", get ignored. Elton's husband David rates only two still photographs in the final montage, along with a caption that tries wrap up a major theme of the movie in a case of telling-not-showing. 

But the musical bits are good, right? Well, some of them, but there are a lot of questionable decisions about that too. I want to know who had the idea for that opening bit with ""The Bitch Is Back"". And to have Taron Egerton belt out ""I'm a juvenile product of the working class, whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass!"" while in the middle of a carefully-choreographed dance number. And the weird use of ""Tiny Dancer"". And ""I miss the Earth so much, I miss my *life*?"" Give me a break. And of course another thing this movie's sure to get praised for including when *Bohemian Rhapsody* didn't is that it shows Elton and John Reid fucking on-screen – well, I'm glad you were able to be titillated, but including that doesn't make the movie inherently better or worse. And maybe it's just me, but I didn't think anything in particular was lost from *Bohemian Rhapsody* by not showing Freddie Mercury fucking strangers in motel bathrooms.

I've been harsh here, but there *were* parts of the movie that I liked completely, I really can't fault any of the actors for what they did with what they were given, and the whole thing *looks* great. But I really don't think it deserves all the praise it's getting. The whole movie gets 2.5 out of 5 from me, as an average of all different moments from everywhere up and down that scale.",bumz7b

I wonder if BR would have been any better if Freddie were still around.

Would we have a more well-rounded look at him or would he still have tried to hide those parts? The rest of Queen painted themselves in a wonderful light, I wonder if Freddie would have been honest about who he was or hid it like the rest of them.

Elton John is decades past all this now and he can look back with agency and say “yeah here’s how I fucked up, here’s how people treated me, here’s how it really happened” and I think that’s what made this story great. You hate John Reid when watching this because he’s cold and controlling and abusive. There’s no excusing that.

For me the talks with him and his best friend were very close to home and oh my god did I cry when he talked to his family at the end and when he hugged his child self. I was so fortunate I had a friend with me who I could hug after that scene. Just thinking about it while in the train back to the clinic makes me a bit choked up again. I really hope people who watch this who don't have mental health issues are able to understand the movie as well as I did and get a better understanding of addicts and their behavior.

And yes, going into rehab was the best choice I have made in my life. I'm ten weeks in now, probably have a few months to go. Feeling is scary, but I couldn't keep running.",bumz7b
epqbyg7,"Exactly this. I thought that the whole movie was a beautifully honest portrayal of the journey of recovery. And how addiction is a seductive “fix” for so many who haven’t addressed their relationship with themselves. 

“When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?”",bumz7b
eptywx1,"I agree. I was wondering if anyone else saw the symbolism in him slowing removing pieces of the red devil(?) costume as the therapy progressed, like he was shedding the excess and becoming his authentic self.",bumz7b

Oh that's why I recognized her. Lol",bumz7b
erkh1f7,I was wondering how it’d compare to BR. This was wayyy better. So much more gritty and compelling. I really felt for Elton and understood where his destructive tendencies came from. Taron killed the performance and sang beautifully as well.,bumz7b
epwunud,It's easier to have balls when the subject is still alive to encourage and co-write the balls. BR was played safe because Freddie is dead.,bumz7b

eq8htki,"During the “I’m Still Standing” sequence at the end, I thought how cool it was to end the movie with the music video with the actual Elton John. But then halfway through, I realized it was still Taron! He really embodied the role.",bumz7b

epugpar,Why would that make a difference? Who's to say Taron won't get nominated for this role?,bumz7b
epnmku4,"He actually gets *less* dressed than everyone else, right down to a bathrobe, which really sold how vulnerable he was and how awkward he was at self-reflecting. Very nice and well-thought-out detail!",bumz7b

epnro0d,"I saw both Godzilla and Rocketman last night, with Godzilla in full IMAX. It was 100% Godzilla. That movie was loud as all get out, and while I loved it, I could hear it across the theatre while I was seeing Rocketman.",bumz7b

epsa9ez,Not quite the same but you should check out Billy Elliot the musical!,bumz7b
eqircz3,"I'm in recovery, 31 years. That moment wrecked me. It was really well done. That moment where you can accept and love yourself and emotionally ""embrace"" the person/child who turned to substances is a turning point in recovery.",bumz7b
eqx4c6d,Cried at this.,bumz7b
etphnxt,"In the end, it didn’t matter getting a hug from Dad like Elton and the audience expected to happen. It was about Elton hugging himself and letting it go. My favorite moment from the film.",bumz7b
eqfp9ew,"People seem to be really torn on that scene. I agree with you, I found it very touching.",bumz7b
epmq1z8,"That said, he has trouble accepting his homosexuality and that leads to a lot of issues - which is probably true to life. But you’re right that the sexuality itself isn’t portrayed as an inherent problem.",bumz7b
erb76vz,"Yes! 
 
I especially love how much him being gay was featured in the movie.
 
I keep hearing “being gay isn’t a personality” and “ugh why does this character have to be gay? Why does it matter?” 
 
I love that the movie shows that being gay **does matter**. That sexuality and our experiences around it shape who we are.  
 
Even now when being gay is more accepted, most gay people still face discrimination because of it. 


I hope this opens some eyes as to why gay characters are important, and why purposely stating a character is gay (instead of coding) is also important if not necessary.",bumz7b

eplglv5,"I really liked how they showed his marriage to be brought out of kindness and affection but even that couldn’t help him at that point. Only he could help himself. Same with when he went back to see his father. No matter how amiable they tried to make their interactions it was too little, too late.",bumz7b
erkhl1a,"Yeah that scene with the vodka was powerful. I think so many people who get to that point know how destructive they’re being to themselves and others and know they should stop, but can’t. And they feel more self-loathing, enforcing that need for alcohol.",bumz7b

eq12iod,"I don't think it was a fluke.  I've never seen Edgerton turn in a bad performance, though I, admittedly, haven't seen *Robin Hood*.

eq5ials,Were the lyrics the exact same as the original songs or was there any changes?,bumz7b

eq8iv9k,"Same happened to me. When whoever asks him ""are you homosexual?"" and he replies ""I don't know."" The older man behind us let out an involuntary snicker. All I could think of was like what the fuck, since at this point he has a girlfriend, and he later gets married so he clearly struggled with his sexuality, but this guy obviously doesn't know any of that. And later when the sex scene happens dude straight up walks out. Then again, I live in the bible belt.",bumz7b

You just sold me on the movie.",bumz7b
epkfgci,"Your enthusiasm is exactly what I feel, but I'm not great at articulating it. But you're so right. Especially about his relationship with Bernie, which was so sweet and well done. The importance that relationship (being loved properly) holds is never lost on you, and it's so beautiful to see how it anchored him and to see that it's importance isn't lost on Elton either.",bumz7b
epk93r6,"I know it probably won’t happen (at least not for a while, but they tried with Cher so why not?!), but Id love to see this be turned into a Broadway musical if they can figure out how too.",bumz7b
epkltqw,"Fantastic write-up! I went to the advance screening a couple weeks ago, and as a fellow fan of Elton it was everything I could’ve asked for. I mean, he’s just one of those almost mythic figures in pop culture, and doing a straightforward biopic would’ve been an injustice. Turning his story into a surreal musical was a brilliant move. The friendship between Bernie and Elton was my personal highlight, and I’ve had the song from the credits playing practically on repeat.",bumz7b
epkfcjv,"> ...my favorite Elton song, Someone Save My Life Tonight, so I was kind of bummed we didn't get that...

That would have fit in perfectly there, and it was definitely a big enough hit to make it in as a setpiece.  My favorite Elton song is ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"", so I knew it wasn't going to make it in.",bumz7b
epkrzgg,Fucking thank you. This movie isn’t perfect but it’s not the cluster fuck of painful edits with flashes of brilliance like bohemian. This movie set the tone from the beginning and followed its formula through to the end some people may think it’s a weird but I think weird is okay (or whatever Elton said to his father in that scene near the end),bumz7b
epwlv9b,The one aspect BoRhap delivered on that Rocketman doesn't is the concerts. No concert scene in any movie ever compares to Live Aid IMO,bumz7b
epukl4l,I remember reading somewhere that Elton didn't want Someone Saved My Life tonight released as a single because it would have needed to be shortened (as it's over 6 mins long) and it's a deeply personal track. Perhaps the same logic would apply to this film too?,bumz7b
eq3j72n,"so you're saying this isn't like Bohemian Rhapsody?  Because while I enjoyed it enough to sit through, I could not get behind it, and felt pretty generic with overall bad pacing/editing.

Pennycooke & Khadimie's soul [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK4B1KxJpFc) totally should have been on the main soundtrack, but it's a Target exclusive.

Even in the middle of Mercury's downward spiral it felt like that. The music was really awkwardly presented.

Rocketman doesn't go super out of its way to sell Elton John, making the movie feel less commercial and irritating, but also tries to do something narratively with the songs! I'm not saying it works 100% of the time, as some of the transitions and song choices are laboured, but by god they actually make an attempt to tell a coherent emotional story about Elton John as a person using his songs as a backdrop for that story. They sell his strengths as a musician and performer in the context of the story, rather than awkwardly building a story around how great he is.

Later, they had a fall out again for 8 years (I think she never got over the fact that being gay is not a phase? but that's just rumour over why they fell out) but he made up with her, paid for her surgery. She passed away recently.

Elton always had a weird relationship with his father. Some people said it wasn't THAT bad but he always insisted that Stanley was an ass to him (probably because of Sheila's influence as well). Yet, he became soooo attached to Watford FC, buying it, became its chairman and one of its most successful leaders/personalities because he said his most happy memories with his father came from going to the WFC matches together. He has really really strong ties with the club still to this day. One of the stands at Watford FC's Vicarage Road Stadium is named the Sir Elton John Stand.

He also cried watching Billy Elliot because it told the story of a talented working-class boy like him, looking for his place in the world. But unlike him, Billy had a loving father who in the end came to London to watch Billy's performance, while Stanley never came to any of Elton's concert. That's why he insisted upon doing Billy Elliot the musical. The loving grandma was added into the musical as a tribute to Elton's grandma Ivy as well.

epkcwyy,"I agree. He went from singing in his bathrobe and underpants in his mom's living room to the next big rock star at the Troubadour in the span of 5 minutes, and then went full ELTON JOHN over a montage. I wanted to see more of the journey upwards before the inevitable slip down.",bumz7b

eppt4u6,"To respond to your wedding point, I think you're right. The pacing is supposed to be fast and you're not supposed to care too much. It kind of represented how much of his life was a whirlwind. Throughout the movie we seem to be skipping large chunks of time, as he is constantly waking up and not knowing where or who he is with. They were only married for 3 years btw and the movie seemed to be more focused on his relationship with his past and childhood.

At least that's what I took away from the film",bumz7b
eppc6sg,"That's a fair point. They didn't even explain what caused them to divorce.

It was an afternoon matinee, though, and only about a dozen of us. Also the folks watching it with me didn’t seem to be the open-minded hippies I thought they would be. In the intense (homosexual) sex scene, there were audible reactions and one guy decided it was time to quickly leave the theater for awhile.",bumz7b
eptqjrx,"To some extent, I agree with you. I wish that the movie had shaved off maybe ten minutes of his downward spiral and added on to his recovery, to fix the pacing issue a bit. That said, let me play devil's advocate for a second:  

In terms of his 1984 marriage, I think it was used as just another indicator of Elton's self-destructive and compulsive behavior, highlighting how he was willing to reach out to anyone who showed him kindness and affection in the midst of a period of intense self-pity and loathing. And to be true, that marriage was but a small blip in his life's journey. Also, I was an addict myself once. It may seem crazy, but sometimes recovery really does happen in a moment of clarity. I was a hopeless alcoholic for over a decade, nearly died and was hospitalized several times. When I finally, *finally* decided enough was enough, I was sober in a matter of days, and have stayed sober ever since. So while it seems jarring in the pacing of a film, sometimes sobriety and healing from addiction really do happen in a flash, and in that sense, again, the film is actually pretty true to life.",bumz7b
epsmp7e,"I took the whole movie to be his big change, given that the whole story was his as he was telling it to the group. I felt that that was the most original thing about the movie. The telling itself was undergoing change.",bumz7b
epuwwsm,"I think with the pacing, as in time jumps, it fits really well with him being an addict since it might have made him forget periods of his life like Matthew Perry from friends. I might see it again because my girlfriend wants to see it and I also wasn’t expecting a musical, or at least for it to be as much of a musical.",bumz7b

epnmx7i,"As an addict and someone who has struggled with the perversely perfect tango of substance abuse and a mis-founded sense of self, I thought that Rocketman got right what most stories within that arena get wrong. The device of the rehab group was brilliant from my point of view. “Why the fuck shouldn’t I be happy?” The addict yells. Anyone who has watched someone new walk through one of those doors would recognize in Elton’s extreme a never changing truth. I didn’t see that circle as the framing device so much as the actual story we were being told. Hence all the flourishes and non-chronological music. We were seeing what he was telling. And the detail of that telling. The growing awareness within that telling... that was his road to self knowledge. ”Tell us your story and we’ll help you question your truth.” Structurally, it’s so fucking smart. But then that’s what you get from a writer like Lee Hall and the trust that Hall has gained from Elton over many years. Personally, the film showed me a little of myself that I’d forgotten how to see. I can’t think of much higher praise than that.",bumz7b
eptsodt,The whole story is literally told from the perspective of the addict. Don't you think that would influence the majority of things you are complaining about?

Feel like they could have showed us more of where he was at certain points in his career, he kind of blew up in America really quickly and then he seemed to have several albums out but I felt we could have had a better understanding of what songs came from what albums. The musical moments were definitely used to gloss over a story that would have been very interesting if they weren’t minimised to just songs.

epwwc05,"I didn't downvote you as I respect your perspective and even agree with some parts.  The movie is framed as EJ telling his story from rehab and has elements of fantasy. It has no intention of being realistic or accurate, it only intends to be accurate to how Elton John was feeling at the time, so the depiction of ""moustache twirling villains"" works in the context of the movie. While I agree that the movie might have been more interesting and had more depth if these characters were painted more grey, rather than black and white, but Elton is the primary focus of the movie and I think he was given enough depth. 
I do think it was a missed opportunity to not include songs from Captain Fantastic and The Dirt Brown Cowboy, given that that album is semi autobiographical. 
I don't think the movie can be faulted for only choosing to cover the first half of his life. Additionally the ommission of some parts of his life was nessecary to tell a cohesive story in 2 hours. 
Don't have much to say about your thoughts on the musical stuff. Seems to be just a matter of taste to me. I did think the use of Tiny Dancer was a bit weird at first as well. 
As for the gay sex scene. While I agree that it's absence may not have made the movie better or worse, I do think that it made it more realistic and natural feeling then if it were simply implied.  It would have been disrespectful to Elton John if they just glossed over his sexuality, given that it was such a  important part of his life. They didn't play it safe and gloss over his substance abuse, so why should they do the same with his sex life. It's also a pretty important milestone for a mainstream movie.

epl0dud,Why,bumz7b
epotoj3,"His performance embodies Elton so well, that when you watch it the songs feel perfectly sung. The advantage of this over other biopics (like Bohemian Rhapsody for example) is that some of the songs were sung live on set.

It was... Okay. The actor was good. The costumes were good. The musical numbers were good. And I was happy that they included the sex and drugs (though I get tired of the Evil Gay Manager trope). I also really liked that they used some pretty obscure stuff and not just hits.

But as an Elton John fan from way back it threw me every time they had a song out of order or changed something factual, especially for no reason, like skipping over Bernie's wife Maxine. And I felt the band got short shrift.

Also, something about the production values made it feel cheesy, like a television movie. Bohemian Rhapsody felt much more cinematically produced",bumz7b

The songs aren't really used to provide historical structure; they're more about how Elton is feeling. That particular moment at the party right after the Troubadour performance, the story needed to set up Bernie pursuing his own love interests, leaving Elton feeling lonely and vulnerable, and (in his pre-rehab mind) steering him to a relationship with John Reid that later became toxic.

Perusing social media, teen music and/or GoT fans seem very aware of the film.

Hell, even the sex content here , while not super graphic, honestly does go beyond PG-13 limits (and not because it's gay sex, if the 'Take Me to the Pilot' sex scene was the same but with a straight couple, it would still be too much for a PG-13), the orgy scene alone I think cements it (and that's too elaborate of a scene to be added in last minute).

Everyone who gets somewhere has some kind of motivation to be the best, and that rarely comes from being a well-grounded, well adjusted person.

A lot of creatives are very open to experiences (it's part of what makes you creative) but when you combine that with the debilitating nature of drugs and the incredible pressure of fame then it's likely to spiral you out.

* The entire framing device for the story

* The tumultuous relationship with his parents.

* Drug and alcohol use culminating in a ""dark"" time

* The scene where he comes up with his name

* Elton John's early career period

* Scenes where he almost instantly composes his very famous songs and instantly gets everyone who listens to it affected by it.

Again, it's not as bad at falling for those traps like, say, *Bohemian Rhapsody* which is just lazily written to begin with. But it definitely still runs into some of the same areas.",bumz7b

On weekends after the initial detox phase we're supposed to spend time outside of the clinic. We're actually not even allowed to stay in, unless you're feeling very unstable and can argue that you fear a relapse. (Like if a close friend or family member died on that day x years ago or something along those lines) They're pretty strict when it comes to this, since it's not just about not using drugs anymore but also about building up a new life and finding out what our 'risk situations' are. 


On Saturdays we're supposed to leave between 7 and 9.15 AM and on Sundays we're supposed to leave between 7 and 10.15 AM. So I usually use those days to catch up on movies at the cinema and hang out with friends and family. And when I feel strong enough to face my shit at home I'll go home and do some cleaning. (I really made a mess of my house when I was using) We're expected back between 6 PM and 10 PM depending on what plans we've made. In the last stages of the rehab program we're even expected to spend some nights at home as well, but I'm not quite there yet.

That’s why these narratives can be so powerful - in the same way that a superhero is an extreme of our own experience (often as a manifestation of the struggle to do what is *right* at an epic scale), so are these superstar stories. They are an exploded version of an everyday experience. We all transform from childhood and through adulthood, it’s just that some transformations are much larger than others. Despite the best intentions, all parents make mistakes. They teach us the world as they know it and we often lose sight of how we start as part of their story not as part of our own.

He had just caught John cheating on him red handed, his mom is ignorant to his troubles, and his best friend Bernie left him to drink with those two girls.

So when he says ""For my next trick, I'm going to kill myself"" it really hits hard because you understand how miserable he is pretending he's the happy, energetic, showman Elton John all the time. 

The scene when he's underwater is probably the first moment of peace he's had in a long time, when all the noise fades out around him and it's just him and the small lonely boy he used to be.

His attitudes towards his sexuality weren’t something to be overcome ~ his parents attitudes towards him were what he needed to overcome.

Oh, that absolutely happens and there's very often talk of it being a certain actor or director's ""time"" to win - Other examples would be John Wayne winning for True Grit and Martin Scorcese for The Departed, neither of which are either guy's best work (and arguably not the best of their respective years), but they happened because people felt that it was ridiculous that neither of them had ever won an Oscar.

I think it really depends on who else gets nominated. If he's up against someone like Edward Norton or Joaquin Phoenix, both much more established actors than Egerton who have never won, then maybe he won't.

That means the scene was so powerfully written and executed that it was meaningful to you. The entire party scene kind of reminded me of Jackson's final moments in A Star Is Born(2018).
