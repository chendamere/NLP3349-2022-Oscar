fn470k8,Does anyone else think the movie was implying that the dad/Ted was the one who got Autumn pregnant? I felt like they were setting that up but then it didn't go anywhere.,fyk6mu
fn4dp4z,"Very powerful and haunting at points.

The scene from where the title came from just fucking floored me.",fyk6mu
fn7ucns,"Liked the movie a lot, but my biggest (stupid) question was why they brought that big ass suitcase if they didn’t expect to stay more than the day?",fyk6mu
fo5qiid,"Everyone is rightfully talking about the scene that gave the film its title, but another scene that really stuck out to me was >!when Autumn tried to induce a miscarriage. God, it was so brutal to watch her choke down those vitamins and punch herself in the stomach over and over!<. Sidney Flanigan was an incredible find here, and I really enjoyed Talia Ryder's performance, too. She has *very* expressive eyes.",fyk6mu
fn0m1dc,"The title scene is one of the most harrowing performances I’ve seen in a while. Can’t believe Sidney Flanigan’s never acted before.

This entire film is a great example of “show, don’t tell”.",fyk6mu
fnbtrsd,Talia Ryder has star potential. Those eyes will make a ton of money.,fyk6mu
fnovs9u,An example of how one great scene can make a movie. As people are saying the title moment was just...incredible.,fyk6mu
ftjjmfo,"Just watched this. I thought the questionnaire scene was absolutely incredible. Besides that, I thought it was a solid little film. Direction was a little boring.

Also -- maybe I'm way off, but...she was raped by her stepdad, right? In the beginning he couldn't even look at her to tell her she did a good job. And once he does, Autumn storms out. Then the scene later where he's with the dog being creepy and saying ""she likes it, shes a little slut, etc"" and it being a major trigger for Autumn.",fyk6mu

fnuj2xl,"Really strong debut performances from Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder. I honestly think these two girls are going to be movie stars. Talia Ryder is in Spielberg's West Side Story at the end of the year too and I really think she's going to take off. Flanigan gives a really natural performance that doesn't even feel like its acting. She gives the movie this fly on the wall documentary feel that's also aided by the gorilla filmmaking in this that you know they didn't have permits for, especially all those subway scenes.

I think the movie tells an important story, but it all felt very procedural for me a times. Like they take you through the entire abortion process from how I would imagine it exactly goes down. It's emotional, and impactful, but there's an obvious message behind it. The movie is looking to ignite change. A change I believe in, because America, your abortion laws are fucked up, but it also makes the film feel like a Planned Parenthood commercial with high production values. Just saying.

It's a simple story led by some really strong performances tied together with an important message. Great chemistry between the two leads. I just think the plot meanders a little bit and I was taken out of the film by how overtly political it's trying to be, even if I agree with its saying.

Made me feel bad for being a dude. Which is fair, we are shitty.",fyk6mu
fnz16e2,Amazing and impactful film with beautiful lead performances. One question I had: why did the crisis pregnancy centre lie about how far along Autumn was? And also what was the dad saying to the dog?,fyk6mu
fzbiboc,"I'm sorry. The movie is good, but it is also really misandrist. All the men are predators and all the women except one are kind characters. And even that one (you know which) thinks that she's acting in a good way.

Reality is not like this. Imagine if the men in the movie were characterised as ""Jews"". We would be talking about a sub-Riefensthal piece.

And it is sad, because the movie is actually good.",fyk6mu
fn511zy,Sharon Van Etten is in this? Gonna try and queue it up later.,fyk6mu
fn2eky2,"Beneath the abortion story, there's a harrowing depiction of how young women are experiencing sex.  Every male character in this movie is kind of a zombified pervert.  Jasper is the only one who shows any brain activity, but even he is just going to great lengths to try to hook up with this girl who will barely talk to him.

It certainly can be true to life, but it's also like an impressionistic depiction of men from the perspective of someone with the history that Autumn describes to her counselor.  Eventually, you think that every man she meets is going to harass her or harm her in someway.  And then you realize you're feeling what she's feeling, and that makes you appreciate even more what she's been through.",fyk6mu
fn5qr14,I really liked this movie. It was sadly relatable at times and it’s a good story. Great acting from everyone involved. That clinic scene was very hard to watch but eye opening.,fyk6mu
fydgidw,"This was a 7/10 for me until the questionnaire scene and from then on it was a really great, engaging film.",fyk6mu
fooh6lo,Every minute was exhilarating and Autumn cousin was an angel,fyk6mu
fn4ok55,"I don’t know how to put into terms what this movie made me feel. It was unsettling, but not in any negative way. That’s the best way I can explain it. The way that music & dialogue is used is amazing.",fyk6mu
fybbcf4,"I wanted to like this movie, but I was seriously put off by the fact they made every male character with more 1 line a serious creep/pervert/asshole.  I counted 7 -- only 2-3 were necessary to the story.  The acting and story besides the overbearing message ""all men are pigs"" were good.

**Four Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days** (2007) is extremely similar to this movie and far superior.",fyk6mu
fyhygne,"Just finished it and I really loved it. I can't believe that was Sidney Flanigan's first movie ever. Damn. She was absolutely perfect.

I don't understand the low scores on Metacritic though.",fyk6mu
fn11na8,"This movie fucked my shit up. I can't remember the last time a movie left me wanting more like this one did.

 Definitely worth the 20 dollars I spent on the rental. Honestly, I don't think I would have heard of this movie if it didn't go up for rental early on Amazon, and that's a shame.",fyk6mu
fnirgo9,"Calling it now, Talia Ryder & Sidney Flanagan are going to be mega stars.",fyk6mu
fomvqwr,"I was hoping it would have been better than it was. Outside of one or two scenes, the film is content with just putting a camera on someone and following them with almost no soundtrack, letting the camera speak for the characters.",fyk6mu

I made a video on this movie if you guys want to check it out!! I’m a rising youtube film critic so it’d be appreciated:) but only if you want to!!",fyk6mu
fnpbc4d,I thought it was pretty impacting. Especially the title scene. All with a first time actor in Sidney. Here her talk about her experience and being cast in the movie here  [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rec/id1455939192?i=1000471562732](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rec/id1455939192?i=1000471562732),fyk6mu
fn0srma,"Even in a full year, I couldn't see myself not considering Sidney Flanagan's performance to be one of the best in the year (including last year, I'd really only put her behind Adele Hanael, Noemie Merlant, and Lupita Nyongo in terms of leading performances). That single take of her's is masterful.",fyk6mu
fn6txla,"She let her cousin go alone with that creep? After all the things that cousin did for her? That is your ride or die, stupid. Don't let her go anywhere alone.",fyk6mu
fn8p63j,"How does this compare to Beach Rats? I really liked that one, especially the cinematography.",fyk6mu
fn274ag,Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder were amazing and I wish them both success with their acting careers going forward.,fyk6mu
fn0gy7a,"
Never Rarely Sometimes Always is easily the best film of the year and it could stay that way if pretty much nothing releases in the 2nd half of the year. Best looking film of the year too (more filmmakers really need to use 16mm). And for a film with such a simple story, I really didn't expect the film to be as tense as it was either but Hittman does a brilliant job at making you feel Autumn's uncomfortableness and lingering pain. So much information is revealed just from her saying absolutely nothing.",fyk6mu
fn0iwk6,"I liked it overall, there were some scenes that were very effective and there were other scenes I thought were in such bad faith and so manipulative they made me angry.",fyk6mu
fn0j4d3,Really want to watch this but it's not available in my country yet :-(,fyk6mu
fn0w3y3,"Currently my favorite of the year. Such a beautifully sensitive, hard-hitting film. Sidney Flanigan is nothing short of spectacular.",fyk6mu
iez3lk8,"!! Did anyone else google the pregnancy test they used in the clinic at the beginning of the movie?  It was called ""Right Time"".  Look it up, it's a gag pregnancy test kit - they sell them at Walmart (currently sold out, though) and amazon.  Guaranteed to give positive results no matter what.  Why did they choose to use this pregnancy test?  Ok if they wanted positive results from anyone on set's pee, but they could have switched out the boxes for a legit brand.... Was someone on set just having a laugh? I can't find anything about this anywhere, I need answers",fyk6mu
fn6utk7,"Yes, that scene with the dog was very unsettling. I think he sexually abused her.",fyk6mu
ftjkjoa,100% was the feeling I got too. The beginning scene where he couldn't even compliment her. The scene with the dog. Her desperation for her mom to not know. Her being SO ANGRY and determined to kill the pregnancy that she starts punching herself. The questionnaire portion.,fyk6mu
fnuj8iq,"I thought it was pretty much a given that he was raping her, but maybe I'm wrong? The way she looked at him with that dog and what he was saying. Also how she really didn't want her mother to find out.",fyk6mu
fn4nv9y,"I personally didn’t see any of that. I felt like it was purposefully ambiguous about who the father was, because it didn’t really matter to the plot.",fyk6mu
hku1p3n,"Damn, it wasn’t THAT deep",fyk6mu
fnp077a,"My personal reading was it showed how young and inexperienced with the world the girls are. Like the only trips they were probably on were big week long family trips were you pack a massive bag so going anywhere means lots of luggage. Also maybe not understanding how awkward hauling luggage around NYC is,",fyk6mu
fn7w525,Lmao I literally just finished the movie and was wondering that the whole time. We see her cousin pack some clothes in the beginning but I don't think they ever changed their wardrobe. I mean it doesn't really matter but it was just kind of funny,fyk6mu
ftjjo80,Her punching herself was too much for me to even watch.,fyk6mu
fnd1s7v,that scene sold the idea to me that this was the best movie of 2020 so far,fyk6mu
fxg06vi,"In [this interview](https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/1/21181698/never-rarely-sometimes-always-eliza-hittman-abortion-stories-films-interview), the director mentions that she left the culprit purposefully ambiguous.",fyk6mu
hku1tiy,"Not really, in my opinion. She just came off as an extremely shy and awkward girl, which she probably is in real life, especially considering this is her first role. So no I don’t believe it was acting, I think she’s just genuinely awkward and weirdly shy",fyk6mu
hn4k216,"I didn't find it political. It's the reality of abortion-seeking women. And women more broadly, in relation to creepy men.",fyk6mu

fxfto3y,">And also what was the dad saying to the dog?

I just watched the film (and had to replay this wtf scene to put the subtitles on).

He's rubbing the dog's belly with his right hand, then reaches with his left hand down towards the dog's hind legs (not in a petting way, but in a creepy 'reaching for something' way). The camera quickly cuts to Autumn making a clearly disturbed look. Not sure if it was inferred that he rubbed more than just the dog's belly, but either way that guy was creepy AF...  

Here's the complete scene dialog from the subtitles, and I noted where the above occurred:

Ted
>Hey. Hi.

>[sets bottle down]

>At least someone in this house loves me.

> That's a girl.
> 
> Who's a good girl, hmm?
> 
>[reaches towards the dog's hind legs]
> 
Yeah, you like that.
> 
> You little slut.
> 
> Who's a little slut?

Mother:
>Stop.

Ted:

> What? She likes it.

> [dog whimpers]

> That's a girl.

>[Ted chuckles]

>Look how easy she is.

At the end, even the poor dog has a worried & creeped-out-AF look on its face...",fyk6mu
fzbj3oq,">why did the crisis pregnancy centre lie about how far along Autumn was? 

Why do you think? Is the country of Trump. And I'm saying this as somebody that is not really 100% in favor of non-rape non-medical danger abortions, and I think that the movie is misandrist. But in some places some medical professionals do things that are clearly unethical (like lie, or even call the police) to women that want to have an abortion. In my country they have called judges and put young women in jail for abortions that were absolutely inside the local law.",fyk6mu
fo5qnp1,"The dad was ""joking"" around about the dog being a slut because she liked having her belly rubbed. It was so stupid and unfunny.",fyk6mu
g0x1k0h,"I just watched the film today and walked away thinking it was really good, I completely missed the aspects you pointed out and you're absolutely right.

Maybe it was a reflection of the perception that Autumn and Skylar had of the people around them?

Their life is filled with abusive relationships both at home and at work,  I've never been good at analyzing movies but maybe we see all the other characters in a dangerous or predatory way because that's the way the girls have grown to view the people and adults around them.

Even the female doctors both in the start of the film and the end are perceived in a way that's kinda of reserved, unsure, standoffish and not trusting. Heck, even the female doctor performing the procedure is shown in a reserved almost callous type of way. You know they are there to good but the film never lets you get comfortable with that feeling, you never feel safe or comfortable with any of the character interactions male or female.

The first doctor seems incredibly caring and kind and for the most part she was, but you still get a sense of betrayal when she makes Autumn watch the religious propaganda abortion film.

They don't trust the adults or the relationships they have in their life, Autumn can't even bring her self to communicate with her mom, it absolutely comes off as male hating at first glance but I think it's more just an untrusting, fearful, cautious and predatory outlook the girls have towards ALL adults, relationships or authority figures in their life.

I could be completely wrong and I'm not super smart at analyzing movies but that's what I took from it at least.

The only person you're ever sure of that's on Autumn's side with no ill intent is Skylar and even that notion falters for a few minutes in the film.",fyk6mu
iezsnca,"not all the men are predators.  the bus driver is a nice man who helps them with their luggage; the security guard supporting the clinic is male; the subway worker is male who offers them directions.  the 3 drummers on the subway are peaceful, talented males who the girls stop and listen to without looking frightened.  the problem u have is that the hero of the film is female, the men take either a background role or that of an antagonist.  get over it, just bc the man doesn't swoop in to save the day doesn't make this film misandrist.",fyk6mu
hn94lai,Haven't movies earned that depiction at least once?,fyk6mu
fzsn8uw,Are you female? Because this movie entirely spoke to my experience as a woman growing up in the United States. The overwhelming majority of my experiences with male strangers is creepy.,fyk6mu
