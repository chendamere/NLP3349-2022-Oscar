For most of the movie I was wondering why we were sitting through so many scenes with this ridiculous tarot card reader, then she ends up becoming a pivotal part of the plot. Kinda wish Scott cut a few of her scenes, though, this really didn't need to be 157 mins long.",r0uxbw

hly6olk,"I enjoyed it, but there were a few parts I didn‚Äôt understand and I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me. 
 1. What was the significance of the man watching Adam Driver‚Äôs character in the very beginning of the movie? We see a man watching him from a car, and also from the riverbank when he‚Äôs on the boat. Who was that guy? 
2. I was confused about the unsigned will. Did Jeremy Irons‚Äô character leave it unsigned on purpose, or was there some manipulation at play? And then later on, was this the same document that turned up with the forged signature? If so, the movie never explained who forged the signature right? Are we supposed to think Lady Gaga‚Äôs character did it? 
3. Why did the police raid Adam Driver‚Äôs house? I thought there were no more tax crimes to account for after Al Pacino got arrested? It seemed like Adam escaped to Switzerland to evade arrest, but later he returned and everything was fine, it seemed like nothing came of the police raid.",r0uxbw
hlwfsa3,"The acting is what kept me watching for sure. I thought the story was kinda meh, and honestly a little boring, and they could have done the first hour in twenty minutes. However, the actors were all so on point that I couldn‚Äôt stop watching it. I think Leto the man is a piece of shit, but Leto the actor was tragically hilarious and very well performed. And Pacino, man was it nice to see subtle nuanced Pacino again, like The Godfather days. Driver was good, Gaga made me sick (in a good way). But ya, forgettable Oscar bait somewhat saved by fantastic performances.",r0uxbw

hlvovr1,"Best part was when Patrizia shows up at Maurizio's house, begging for him to come home. It was a heartbreaking scene but I felt both actors sold it very well.",r0uxbw
hlv84hx,"I wish they would have made it more obvious the passage of time, and what years/dates were happening when. For example, we see Aldo celebrating his 70th birthday, then two scenes later he‚Äôs celebrating it again, is that the following year? Hard to tell.

Honestly there was a missed opportunity with the use of music - I wish they would have used songs that were reflective of the actual year a scene is taking place in, instead of whatever random pop songs they chose.

I also ultimately don‚Äôt think Maurizio was anything more than a hen-pecked husband. Patrizia never had any real power or even fame or public devotion, she was just kind of - there. It seems like in the real life Gucci story, the family would have screwed up their business with or without her involvement. The real point of interest is the murder, which they spent very little time on.

Overall though the movie was entertaining, and everyone put out a great performance. I don‚Äôt think it will sweep Oscar gold, but there will probably be some nominations.",r0uxbw

hmcv7p3,"Watched this tonight and loved it. But I'm gonna need some external opinions to help clear up a discussion with my girlfriend.

We can't fully agree on the relationship between Maurizio and Patrizia. We do agree that Patrizia began as a gold digger (Points to her reaction to his name and then stalking him) but we then have varying opinions. 

Did she really fall in love with him? (Points to marrying him despite him having nothing at the time and them being happy without wealth) 

Or did she always see the potential for power and money and she trusted it would come back? (Points to the scenes with Pina and her kickstarting him going back to the Gucci family)

At the end, when she's at his house because of the divorce, was she crying and so on because she loved him or was it because she lost the power and wealth?

PS: Either way, despite her being the ""villain"", I did feel bad for her. What an amazing performance.",r0uxbw

hly6eyv,"I don‚Äôt understand the praise Leto is getting in this thread. I thought he was ridiculous! Every other character was a perfectly dialed in level of camp and then he comes in and it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs from an entirely different movie. Camera greedy in a bad way, a total distraction and departure from the tone and feel of the rest of the movie and I still can‚Äôt get over putting him in all that makeup instead of just hiring a schlubby actor. It just didn‚Äôt work. Cartoonish. It was like a joke that insisted in itself, but never earned its place. People were laughing at him during my showing, but not like, a good laugh, a mocking laugh, like how did this make the final product? 
  
And it‚Äôs not like pitiful failson without talent can‚Äôt be done well and within the tone of the work. . . Just look at Succession, there‚Äôs like five different flavors of that in that show.",r0uxbw

hm7jpl5,"Wow, whoever made that trailer needs a RAISE! The way they really shaped a narrative into that trailer that suggests a story that's quite different from the movie...

Like, with Patrizia saying at the end of the trailer ""I subscribe to unconventional punishment"" and then hitting the cup twice, one would think she was some sort of mob boss. But that scene isn't even in the movie. 

Aldo telling her in the trailer ""this isn't a woman's game"" and then she looking at Marizio as if he wasn't backing her up and she was left to fend for herself. The way this scene plays out in the movie is so different. 

In fact, the number of scenes in the trailer that don't make it into the movie while not a lot definitely reshaped my expectations going into the movie. Maybe that's why I was a bit let-down by the movie itself because it was just not as ""boss bitch Patrizia"" as the trailer suggested it would be. 

Still generally liked the movie though, 7/10.",r0uxbw
hluw9uw,"A hardcore Adam Driver sex scene is precisely what ""Rise of Skywalker"" was lacking.  Nice to finally see the missing piece of the puzzle on the big screen. 

Alright, now that the obvious is out of the way:

- This movie is really fuckin' long but I wasn't bored the entire time. It has an odd sense of charm. I *do* have to ask myself though if I would've been as invested if I had watched at home while streaming and not ""trapped"" in a theater without other potential distractions. Regardless, I'm glad I watched it the way I did. 

- Fuck Jared Leto... but unfortunately the guy is an amazing actor and this movie would've suffered without him.  I lost my shit at the car horn swear scene and smiled many other times he was on screen.  

- Goddamn, Lady Gaga is taking cinema by storm. She's great! 

- There's a scene where our characters are having drinks on a patio and a dog walks over to the pool. When the camera switches angles,  the dog is in the exact same spot. Either they multi-cammed that and it was the same take or it was *awesome* continuity and a very well trained canine actor. 

- The movie has a few pacing issues. It seems that this happens.  Then this happens. Then this happens.  Which I've learned recently is a bit of a cinema no-no.  It's best explained in [this short video](https://youtu.be/vGUNqq3jVLg) This is based on true events though so I understand that you can't perfectly pace something without filling in the gaps with ridiculous liberties. The movie kinda just quickly wraps up after Driver's character has been murdered and I feel like other scenes should've been cut to explore that part more. It's murder and murder is interesting. 

- I feel like this movie isn't going to sweep at the Oscars but most of the actors will certainly get nominations. 

- Maurizio playing with the boys while washing cars was one of the most adorable things I've ever seen. I smiled a lot.

- Jeremy Irons couldn't be anymore British but he plays an Italian in this movie and that's nice.  

- My girlfriend told me that Adam could Drive her.... cool.

- The cinematography is simple but still carries a lot of depth and is well executed.  However,  the color grade consistency felt a bit jarring in-between scenes.  That might just be me though. It's hard for me to explain because I'm not a colorist.

- I'm probably never going to watch this movie again but I definitely didn't waste my time either and wouldn't mind talking about it if it's brought up.

#**6.5/10. I think the majority of the reviews are treating it fairly.**

*Edit: I thought a bit more and I'm knocking my score down from 7 to 6.5. The pacing was really really messy and there are certain plot points that I'm not even sure were ever wrapped up. Maybe they weren't in real life but then just don't introduce them at all. I don't watch biographical films as biographies.  I watch them as films. I really want them to be well paced and tightly executed.*",r0uxbw
hlvhc0b,"The reviews are so mixed for this film and I‚Äôm about to mix ‚Äòem up even more!

- Not too long. Not too boring. Just very poorly edited. It lingered on boring scenes and cut off exciting scenes. Give Gaga more reaction shots and this movie could have been a Best Picture contender.

- Jared Leto was so cartoonish. Is he secretly trying to steal the Super Mario role from Chris Pratt. If this is a good portrayal of an Italian, then I owe a lot of improv 101 students an apology.

- Driver and Pacino shined and really remind you why they‚Äôre leading men. But Hayek was severely miscast and underutilized.

- Ridley Scott needs to give his Production Designer a promotion of some sort because the world looked so regal and heavenly. They really made it feel like the 70s and 80s which is perfect for keeping boomers from nodding off, but didn‚Äôt do anything for a cell phone-touting, selfie-taking millennial like me /s",r0uxbw

hlzticb,One thing I always remember when a new Leto film is out is that people totally disregard directing and editing when it comes to an actors performence.,r0uxbw
hmditsq,I liked parts of this movie but I wish it had gone all in on being a black comedy. The tone bounced around way too much,r0uxbw
hlushqf,"This is a tough movie. There were no really boring scenes, the performances were solid, the story is both true and fairly interesting, but for some reason I just didn't care about any of it. It felt very cold.

Driver and Gaga are great, as is the rest of the cast. Driver's character, the shy and humble rich by association son, I think by nature just doesn't give him much of a chance to shine. Meanwhile, absolute smokeshow Lady Gaga and someone I'm told is Jared Leto were chewing the hell out of the scenery. There's some classic Pacino to be had in here as well, and that's all great.

The story was pretty interesting, although I'm not sure it needed the full two and a half hours to tell it. It's interesting that Maurizio was originally uninterested in the family business and even describes it as something you can never have enough of once you start, which is how each family member seems to see it. It's like all of the worst things about Patrizia rubbed off on him throughout their relationship. She was definitely the catalyst of all negative events in the movie, and I thought it was honestly really funny she was being guided by some crazy cat lady who reads tarot cards over the phone. I loved how when she initially called in she was hearing her own voice on screen, bascially signifying Hayek was only there to reflect what she wanted back to her rather than give her new or true information.

I guess my main criticism is that it's messy storytelling. It focuses on their relationship one moment, then on the business, then on the tax troubles, but as soon as that's introduced it's sidelined with no explanation. Time moves in a way that's difficult to keep up with and mostly shown by the age of their daughter. Plots that are seemingly very serious seem to end up not being very important, all the while as a layman I'm not really following the technical tax/business/fashion babble. It wasn't impossible to understand, but it definitely felt like the movie would tell me how to feel about something rather than explain that thing fully.

That said, the movie is very stylish. It looks great, it's funny at times, and I've got worse things to do than watch Lady Gaga create a bunch of new fetishes for me. Not knowing anything about this story I often wondered where it was all going during the movie, and when we get to the focal point it does feel a bit anti-climactic. That said, it's a pretty nuts true story and has some interesting character performances holding it up.

Overall, I feel a strong 6/10. I'm not dying to see it again but I enjoyed watching it even if there were some apparent flaws.

hlv0cfc,"I can‚Äôt say I wasn‚Äôt entertained the whole way through but what the fuck was even this movie? both the storytelling and the tone are all over the place. there‚Äôs nothing to latch onto with any of the characters or even the story going on because of how it jumps both through time and around from relationship to business stuff. it all felt so stringed together and like stuff was just happening and it‚Äôs a guessing game of if you‚Äôll get any resolution to those things (for example the whole forged signature thing? what caused Driver to just flee and leave his kid there? Nothing happens to Driver for that whole thing happening like why did the FBI even search the house? Did I miss something?) everything is so one note and campy, Driver & Gaga‚Äôs relationship has nothing to it and even the fact she was pushed to have him killed is given no real justification whatsoever? The murder  happens and it just rushes to credits, no time to breathe no nothing. my mind is all over the place with this movie, what a weird fucking movie",r0uxbw

Lady Gaga is goddamn incredible in this and I would have never thought this is just her second main role in a major motion picture. It will be a very fun movie to rewatch and there are so many memorable moments.

I enjoyed Gaga, Drivers, and Pacino‚Äôs acting. 

However I didn‚Äôt enjoy the long runtime. Along with the poor editing made the passage of time and narrative so confusing. One scene they‚Äôre living it up in their NYC penthouse, very next scene their in Italy and it‚Äôs the 90‚Äôs? Why did Driver‚Äôs characters house get raided? And he escaped to Switzerland, then came back like nothing happened.

It was ok.  Seemed like a documentary recreation that lasted 2.5 hours.  You knew what was going to happen.  It took forever to get there.  The murder was matter-of-fact.

It never rose above a strict recreation.  The business intrigue was more interesting than the marriage falling apart.

Nothing bad, but it also has no emotional impact.

Acting oscillated between compelling and totally over the top. 4/10",r0uxbw

Either one of those two would have been fine, but it keeps randomly switching between these two styles and it is really jarring. But above all, this movie is simply boring.

hobgj5d,"I thought it was a stinker, dreadfully written and terrible pacing. 

Its been said before but the flow of time is bewildering in this film. It‚Äôs impossible to know how much time has passed from the previous scene. While not inherently a problem, for a true story film that spans multiple decades the film maker making absolutely no effort to give the viewer a sense of time is a main contributor to the main issue of this film. The film is just a collection of scenes with little to string it all together. By the end of the 2h 40m I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters which is a remarkable achievement for such a strong cast. The love story was dull, the family dynamic was unconvincing and the murder plot was so horridly woven in to the film I watched it feeling as though they decided to add the murder in only after they had done a first edit of the film and rushed to film those scenes. 

While the film was terrible I was actually left impressed at how such an iconic brand with an intriguing sinister storyline managed to produce such a tedious and uninteresting film. 

The motivations and power dynamics of the main characters are developed poorly. Each scene felt like we were adapting to new versions of the characters rather than seeing any gradual growth. This film abandons any sense of cause and effect, other than the painfully obvious foreshadowing. 

It was like watching a film that should have had a narrator at regular intervals, except there is no narrator. As such the viewer has to fill in most of the plot themselves.

The music was awkwardly forced in at times and other times, for pivotal scenes, even a basic music score would have contributed some semblance of emotion. 

Jared Leto needed to tone it down as his character was borderline offensive at times. Having said that he nailed it in some scenes and held his weight with Al Pacino. 

Adam Driver and Lady Gaga did well with what little the script gave them. And their performances were drowned out by poor directing and amateur editing.

Ironically, the house of Gucci was a film with no style and even less substance. Ridley Scott clearly has too many yes-men around him. This film lacked the creativity and conviction that you would expect from an esteemed director. 

Save your money and don‚Äôt see this film.",r0uxbw

*One feels that some roles were expanded to simply attract and then to placate the stars. As the running time ticks by, viewers are subject to pointless and sometimes confusing scenes that seem to exist solely for the purpose of allowing the leading actors to ‚Äúact.‚Äù*  
  
*Under different circumstances, there is no doubt that some of those scenes would have ended up on the cutting-room floor. But because they stayed in, there is no time for the character development of the key players and thus we have little attachment to‚Äîor empathy for‚Äîany of them. The result, sadly, is a story in which we identify with no one.*

I think the movie will get noms with Best Picture, Actress, Supp Actor (Pacino) Costume and Makeup. For me Al Pacino was the standout along with Gaga. I enjoyed the Leto performance, but it didn‚Äôt work for me in every scene. Driver is deserving of a nom and I think this is his best performance to date; but playing the straight man to Gaga, Leto, Pacino and Irons, will have many overlook him come award season. 

The soundtrack was a 10/10 for me, the song choices were a great way to keep the movie‚Äôs energy flowing; otherwise, I can see why critics dinged the editing and script. I don‚Äôt think Ridley was the right director for this, but the man is a legend and this film can stand next to some of his best work, simply for the fact, there‚Äôs nothing else like it in his catalogue.

It was fine; very melodramatic, all the accents are a bit off-putting until you get used to them, the characters are all larger than life. I didn't really get a good sense of the timeline, nor what the actual duties and responsibility of each family member was supposed to be. Pacino and Irons were great in their roles, as expected, but I thought Adam Driver's characterization was a bit flat and one-dimensional. And I'll be honest, I didn't even realize it was Jared Leto in the make-up until I saw the end credits. I knew the character of Paolo looked off somehow and the eyes were so familiar. I actually thought he was one of the most authentic performances in the film. As for Lady Gaga herself, I don't think I've ever found her sexier. In both this and A Star is Born, I definitely prefer her as a brunette.",r0uxbw

hmac9wp,"I loved this movie. Lady Gaga absolutely crushed it, so did Al Pacino. What I loved about this movie is that no one was particularly bad or good.

&#x200B;

\- Patrizia was of course after the money , but she was also a loyal wife, sticking to him when they were excluded from the family and enjoying a simple family life. She made Maurizio a monster, but also made him become a real man out of what was before pretty much simply an awkward nerd. She of course tried to push Aldo and Paolo out of the business, partially because she felt she was never considered a real Gucci, as they kept reminding her she was not a Gucci. Of course she ended up completely crazy, but you could also feel that she did love her husband in a crazy way.

\- Maurizio started out as innocent and sweet, even giving up all his wealth for his love and family.  Of course, after some time, he became cold, brutal and cruel. In the end, he ditched his wife and family for a high school sweetheart. Hearing him say 'you did not marry a monster, only a Gucci' was chilling. He became everything he hated about Gucci. He ended up selling his entire family out.

\- Aldo is complicated. You get the feeling that he wants Maurizio to reconcile with his family, partially because he believed it would help him develop Gucci further and make more money. But in the end, he still was an old-school family businessman and you did get the feeling he valued family. He knew his son was strange but stuck with him in the end, even though he was betrayed by him. 

\- Paolo was an idiot. He did not want anything particularly evil, but he was willing to sell out his family and even damage the firm only to be able to live his dream as a fashion designer. But you could also see that he never really wanted to harm anyone particularly.

&#x200B;

Maurizio mentioned that Gucci was like a cake. Once you get a piece, you want more and more. So everyone got corrupted by the luxury, or 'high off their own supply'. Ironically, it made me really sad for Maurizio and Patrizia not working out. The chemistry they had in the first half of the movie was amazing.",r0uxbw

hlvcikm,"This is one of the worst movies I‚Äôve seen all year. The performances are all over the top and their accents were horrible. Scott does a terrible job of showing the passage of time. Knowing nothing about the Gucci family or their history, Hayek‚Äôs character felt completely unnecessary. At least unnecessary for such a big name actress to play the part. They could have done more to build a relationship between Patrizia and Pina. 

Also, Maurizio‚Äôs change of attitude toward Patrizia came completely out of left field. There was no sign that was coming. Surely there was more to it than just the return of an old girlfriend.

After it was over I wondered how much was cut from the final edit. It seemed that there were a lot of missing scenes while simultaneously feeling like it went on forever. Maybe this will get a director‚Äôs cut like ‚ÄúKingdom of Heaven.‚Äù Disappointing follow up to ‚ÄúThe Last Duel.‚Äù",r0uxbw

I get why some people wouldn‚Äôt like it especially with people who wanted a more serious take on the Gucci story, but it‚Äôs just more fun this way then.

And if you as a director, are going to grant yourself three hours to tell your story, I expect you to at least answer the most important psychological questions of the character- and plot development, and not hastily skip over them to return to your uninteresting narrative of overacting puppets.

The vibe was all over the place.

Stylistically, it was even more inconsistent. There was some scenes with subtitles, most with none. When there were subtitles, it added about as much as those that didn't. The music didn't fit in a lot of the scenes (wtf was the song choice for the wedding??). And Jesus how tf did they not catch the moment where Adam Driver said something but his mouth didn't even move during the Versace show?

Ridley Scott but off more than he can chew with this one. It's funny and charming at times with a somewhat gravitating plot, but it was way too long and all over the place.

It‚Äôs that line ‚ÄúI never asked for your help‚Äù that broke her. He watched and pretended he didn‚Äôt see what his wife was becoming. And before he told her to slow down, he stood by her side.

I read somewhere that the police didn't know who did it for a while-- how'd they finally figure it out?",r0uxbw
hpjzxro,"I enjoyed the movie overall and the acting was all around fantastic. But I do feel like it could have been much better too. The pacing and structure really undermined an otherwise intriguing story. 

Upon reflection there really were some interesting character developments. I think the movie is meant to show how Mauricio is a reluctant and sheltered heir who becomes a confident and successful businessman thanks to Patricia. She for her part tragically makes the man and the business but loses both due to her greed and/or love.

There is a lot of interesting dynamics there but I felt like these weren‚Äôt communicated very well during the film. It was too disjointed and big moments weren‚Äôt allowed to be explored. Things just kind of happened. Probably the best example of what I mean is that when Mauricio moves to Switzerland his entire character seems to change in an instant with really no explanation. There isn‚Äôt any real set up for why he would want to abandon his wife and daughter. I can come up with some theories based on what I think the character arc is (as mentioned above) but the movie doesn‚Äôt show this to the audience. Rather, the audience is apparently expected to do that work for the director. 

This is contrasted by the Pacino buyout scene. This is one of the few times in the movie where a character arc is properly set up and has payoff. It‚Äôs was just made much more clear to the audience how much care Pacinos character put into helping Mauricio, only to be betrayed. This scene hit hard and was one of the only properly developed character arcs. 

I think part of the problem is the movie couldn‚Äôt quite decide on a single protagonist. Is the movie about Mauricio or is it about Patricia? Gaga for her part did an excellent job, I felt like I was connecting with her character the most while also being unable to decide on her motivations. Was it love or money or both? I think that dynamic can work and she pulled it off. I was disappointed though with her role in the final third of the film. It felt like her character was suddenly forgotten about and wasn‚Äôt given anything to do with the story except to decide to murder out of the blue. Again, nothing in the movie explains her motivations here and it felt rushed and an afterthought. One scene she is talking with her fortune teller about spells and the next scene they are hiring hit men. I would have liked a scene where Patricia emphasizes how badly Mauricio screwed up the company without her guidance, but we only got one line. No real payoff for all the setup regarding her role in the company.

Driver‚Äôs acting was very convincing, but I felt like his character wasn‚Äôt given enough. He almost felt like the passive observer protagonist even though the movie is ostensibly supposed to be about him. Everyone does everything for him and he just moves along. This works in the first half but even when he becomes confident and successful we never really get a chance to see him to lead, he‚Äôs only ever reacting to other characters. Referring once more to the character arcs I mentioned in the first paragraph, his character development is implied but ultimately doesn‚Äôt really land. I feel like Driver had a lot of potential but wasn‚Äôt given the chance to really shine. 

I also found some of the business aspects of the movie hard to follow. I didn‚Äôt really understand how the scheme to take over the company worked. I barely understand why Mauricio was being chased by the tax authorities. Like I know it had something to do with the document signature but like a lot of things in the movie these details are momentarily introduced and then forgotten about until much later. Most importantly, we are told by Driver and Gaga that Pacino/Paulo are bad for the business but we are never shown or explained why. Were they losing money? Were they losing status? Again, another example of unclear character motivations. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I actually did enjoy the movie, and it was far too long I was never bored. But I can‚Äôt help but think the actor performances saved an otherwise messy and uninspiring plot. I think this movie just has a lot of learning opportunities for how to have better flow, development, and payoff in a character and better pacing in a plot. The first half and second half almost felt like two different and unrelated movies.",r0uxbw

hvrcopg,"Is everyone in this thread commenting on the same movie because I swear i must've seen a different version of house of Gucci than most other commenters???

First of all, how in the world are people so enamored with gaga and Leto's performance. I agree with those saying gaga is more Russian than Italian with the accent, and at no point would i consider that level of overacting worthy of all the academy award talk. Though you can't say overacting without bringing up the ham planet that was Jared Leto in this who at some points I had to be sympathetic towards because the movie portrays him as the son that must've experienced significant head trauma to be bumbling around in that hilarious excuse for a super Mario accent and fat suit.

 Irons and Driver really seemed to phone it in with the accents; Irons practically gives up 10 minutes into the movie, and Pacino at best is passable, but all of them have the issue where the beginning of their sentences they're trying to go full Italian, then by the end of a sentence at some points are back to their native American/English accents.


The editing and exposition was straight up atrocious. There are multiple time jumps with no explanation of where we are and why, and the sets and characters all look the exact same where it's hard to discern how much their character was supposed to age between scenes. Certain scenes go far too long while others you have no idea what happened and boom now we're in another office for a betrayal. And at the end of the day idk if it was just me but the coloring was just too drab too often that it really dulled the outfits/clothing in general.

hm3chzp,"I won't sugarcoat it--I did not care for this movie in the slightest. Even so, I am genuinely glad that the consensus here is different, as it is a terrible fate to sit in a nearly 3-hour movie when you're starting to feel restless at 90 minutes.

For me, I think the biggest issue I had was with the script. It was just so dry and meandering. There was nothing that resonated with me or gave me pause for a second thought.  Which, in fairness, not every movie NEEDS to have something profound to say.  But for a movie that's got every reason to be emotionally agonizing, none of it landed for me. Most of the actors did a decent enough job, but you can only breathe so much life into something glib.

I also found the tone to be all over the place. It's like they couldn't decide what direction to go, so they just infused everything all at once. There were too many scenes where I felt like I was watching two actors in two different movies. There was nothing immersive about these interactions, and I never felt the tension.

Arguably, I can look past pitfalls like those of the aforementioned if there's incredible cinematography, sound design, etc, but I felt like everything was mediocre. There was not one highpoint where I felt like you could point to as being ""objectively superior""

Pool all of this together with an egregious run time, and it just fell categorically flat in every way I could imaginne.",r0uxbw

Wanted to like this film but there wasn't a single enjoyable relationship between the cast. Nobody played off each other. They all looked like they were having fun but I really don't see any as nomination worthy.

Leto was awful.

Everything felt so transactional and flat.

Was it meant to be funny? Because it was a packed out cinema and there was barely a peep save for a cringey laugh at the chocolate/poop line from Leto, and he'd already lost me with his farce of a performance.

I am so incredibly disappointed with this one. 5/10.",r0uxbw
hmzvw6g,"Very odd film. Fundamentally suffered from an inability to tell who the main character was imo. Clearly Adam Driver is the main character of the story they were telling for large parts of the movie imo, but the focus felt mostly on Gaga (understandable as she is the best thing about it) but this film needed to be more from his perspective than hers. 

Now personally I think Gaga was a better choice for main character but if they were going to do that they needed to actually tell her story rather than fucking about with the Gucci business stuff. Show us the fall of her relationship with Maurizio, her relationship with Pima, her actually coming to the decision to kill him. Instead everything on that side was stuffed into five minute scenes that just straight up told us how characters were feeling/why in favour of Leto completely ruining parts of the film.

His performance in this is genuinely terrible. If I was the family of Paolo I would be massively offended by what this film turned him into. He oscillates between a caricature of an Italian, to someone who almost appears to have a mental impairment. It‚Äôs just bizarre. It‚Äôs not even a campy, fun performance like Lady Gaga or Al Pacino is giving. It‚Äôs just really off putting. The worst part is Paolo is clearly the most obvious heart of this film. He‚Äôs the only one who seems to be a clear victim of the others. He almost reminds me of a Eduardo Saverin type from the Social Network. In that Andrew Garfield nails the massive betrayal and justifiable outrage that is also the core of Paolo‚Äôs story in this. Instead it‚Äôs played for laughs or that he deserved it for being dumb and a joke. 

The movie also has terrible issues with tonality and just general plot progression. Aldo for the majority of the film appears as this nice guy who helps Patrizia and Marizio, then suddenly he turns on them over fake bags for some reason? Or Marizio falls out of love with Patrizia in about 20 minutes after seeing a character we‚Äôve literally never heard of or seen before? Same with her deciding to have him killed. Just poorly paced imo. The movie can‚Äôt decide if it‚Äôs a social network style business downfall movie or a almost lifetime-esque story of Marizio and Patrizia. 

It‚Äôs a shame because the movie itself is competently made as expected from Ridley Scott, everyone is good in it apart from Leto and looks gorgeous. I do also think it‚Äôs lacking a little bit of flair that a story set in this world did require imo. If you compare it to something like American Crime Story about Versace which, while flawed in its own way, had a style and flair to it that this lacks imo.

Also just remembered the bizarre use of music in this film as well lmao",r0uxbw
hm07u0u,"I‚Äôm a little torn here. 

After having just seen The Last Duel a month ago, it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed by the variety of storytelling. 

That said I think there was some frustrating similarities - the visual desaturation, random plot point lurches, etc. I think the narrative device of Last Duel was more interesting - this movie switches from character to character so often it‚Äôs hard to feel like there‚Äôs a consistent point of view.

Lady Gaga gets top billing but we don‚Äôt see the movie from her / the outsider perspective. We see it each from each member of the family, which is fine I guess but it also feels a little unsatisfying. 

I think the movie was sort of torn between being a two hander relationship drama and also feeling the need to cover blow by blow of the Gucci empire. Was it really necessary to coyly introduce Tom Ford and have the runway scene? Speaking of which, there was a random moment when he says ‚Äúwomen on the runway and men of course‚Äù then it cuts to Jack Huston as if they‚Äôre flirting. All of the business dealing felt similarly perfunctory. Not dramatically interesting but somehow the filmmakers felt like it *had* to be part of the story. 

The disintegration in their relationship felt like it was out of nowhere. He‚Äôs suddenly super cold to her, but I‚Äôm not sure it really feels like an organic direction for the story to go in. It‚Äôs more ‚Äúwell this happened so let‚Äôs let it happen.‚Äù

Considering how long it was, the movie felt pretty consistently entertaining. 

I like Driver normally but he felt sort of flat here and in Last Duel. His character is supposed to be affable on the surface but is in reality sheltered/spoiled with some delusions of grandeur. I just felt it was kind of a thankless part. He just smiles most of the movie and tries for an accent.

Speaking of which, the use of Italian was all over the place. I would‚Äôve preferred them to just speak normally (like Last Duel) but I guess they thought that‚Äôd bother people.",r0uxbw
hm4194y,"I was completely on this movie's wave length because I was grinning the whole time. Its long but I was always engaged, interested, and compelled to keep watching. 

I think it really did come together even with its performances, that range from deranged (Lady Gaga) to hilarious (Jared Leto, Salma Hayek) to sane (Driver) to admittedly lazy (Jeremy Irons). Tone wise I found it to have the right  pitch of melodrama and comedy.",r0uxbw
hmv7c6w,"hot damn it was bad. Patrizia Reggiani was and still is an entitled piece of human garbage and they of course went the quasi feminist victim route because god forbid a woman who's a piece of shit in real life can be portrayed as a piece of shit in a movie these days. All she ever did in her life was cutting corners in order to get rich fast. That's all she was. Oh, and also a criminal. They didnt research shit and as a result, movie is the usual Americanized trash. Adam Driver and Irons are good in it, though",r0uxbw
hlvcdr7,Surprised how entertaining this film is with almost a three hour runtime.,r0uxbw
hly5xyl,"This movie was really good, I was never bored, I laughed a lot, and the characters were fun to watch. It‚Äôs hard for me to properly explain what is missing from this movie but I have a few things that jump out. Everyone was overacting a little too much for me, I think this worked for a lot of people but for me it made the emotional scenes carry no weight. 

The soundtrack was really bad. I kept noticing what song was playing over a scene instead of just being immersed and criticizing the choices and sound mixing too. The party scene at the beginning didnt feel like a party, the scene in the rowboat had weird Sims music playing over it. My favorite song ‚ÄúHeart of Glass‚Äù that was used in the trailer was played over the most boring scene imaginable and just wasted (Paolo and Aldo hug in the airport). 

The costumes and sets were luxurious and impressive but the cinematography felt bland. I wish it felt more like Crazy Rich Asians, it‚Äôs a movie about Gucci after all, and thats the best way I can explain it. 

Lastly I think they hit all the beats on the Patrizia and Maurizio love story but whenever they covered the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù drama about tax evasion and who holds what shares I was so confused. There was that signature debacle with the inheritance tax, it was never resolved, there were both Italian and American feds showing up, and although you can imagine it was related to taxes/debts it was again rushed. What gave Adam Driver the right to use the copyright thing against his brother? The little sentences at the end of the movie explaining how with no Guccis involved anymore and Tom Ford at the helm the company made an incredible rebound actually did more to help me understand than all of the dialogue about how they were backstabbing each other. Still a fun movie and I love Adam Driver, 7/10.",r0uxbw
hlzj87p,"I saw this movie earlier today. My overall review is 6/10. It's not bad, but it's also not great.

In my opinion, both *The Last Duel* and *House of Gucci* would've worked better as miniseries, or even two full TV series. The Guccis were compared to the Medicis once during the promotional tour, and yet the Medicis got their own TV show, titled *Medici*. The same goes for the Tudors.

My opinion on *House of Gucci* is that it was overly long - it's only 20 minutes shorter than the juggernaut that was *Avengers: Endgame* \- and its pacing was breakneck to the point of whiplash in some areas, and slower in others (i.e. pacing issues). It was also obvious that a lot of the footage used in the promotional tour was ultimately cut from the film, and Matt Damon similarly said that over an hour's worth of footage ended up being cut from *The Last Duel*.

For further runtime comparison, *Titanic* (1997) is 3 hours and 14 minutes long, but you don't feel time passing as much, because the story is so engaging. Not so with *Gucci*, sadly.

*House of* *Gucci* isn't a bad film, per se. It just could've been so much better as a longer series.

If *House of Gucci* were more like an Italian *Downton Abbey*, I feel it would be much better, as well as cover a lot more material from the book that ended up on the cutting room floor. We could've also seen more focus and development on each character, which I feel that *House of Gucci* sacrificed in order to be able to squeeze as much book content in as little time as possible.

That being said, I did appreciate the *Amadeus* [reference and foreshadowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBeBjqKSGQ), particularly in the scene where Paolo Gucci (Jared Leto)'s wife, Jenny, sings the ""Queen of the Night"" aria (?).",r0uxbw

hna5fwh,"Maybe reading the book fucked me up because I hated this. Everything was rushed. A lot of telling rather than showing. The performances were mostly fine but all in broad strokes as they really had nothing to work with.

For someone who hates superhero movies, Scott made a superficial, bland movie himself. The Last Duel was a vastly superior film and I would wholeheartedly recommend that one",r0uxbw
hqwi8un,"It felt like a scary movie-ish parody of spoilt rich asians , the Italian sequel.

I was riveted by the set dressing which alternated between incredible period pieces and knock offs, and then at the same time complete lack of attention to the period, sometimes in the same scene.

Also the make up was all over the show. Irons in particular swapped between looking like a zombie and being his normal dapper self in between camera angle changes.

Gaga was horrifically bad. She really is a poor actress, and the script did her no favours.

It was way too long for what the story was, heaps of the plot points made little sense and there wasn't a believable accent by a single actor which begged the question... why do them?


Leto's character was amazing. He felt like when Austin Powers assumes a fake identity.
I was riveted by the so bad it's good moments with him.

The editing was absolutely hilarious.

Also really enjoyed the way the movie tried to be pretentious and raunchy but absolutely failed because they cast too famous a star and couldn't get her to get her bits out which resulted in these hilarious PG sex scenes.

Also the lady gaga orgasming scene was the stuff of legends, I suspect that's probably how she does it IRL it was just so genuine and not sexy.

Driver was great but he didn't really do anything other than smile for the first half and frown for the second half. Also cutting to your editing at the start of the film is just so played out, it really showed Ridley Scott's age.

They chose such strange plot points to care about or meander on.

Kinda boring in the middle but an enjoyable movie, but an utter failure as a biopic, completely immersion breaking constantly.

Highly recommend this movie with a bunch of drinks and somewhere  you can laugh loudly about the bizzarro nature of the direction and acting.",r0uxbw

i also feel like there was a sense of campiness to this movie? i don‚Äôt know if that was intentional or not but i liked that. i also liked how the story showed the various flaws of all of the characters, not just Patrizia‚Äôs flaws. i like how the movie showcased the glamor of Gucci (the fashion shows, Patrizia trying on the clothes) without glamorizing what happened to Maurizio. 

i wish some parts were emphasized less than others, like we didn‚Äôt need two birthday party scenes, but i would have loved to watch Patrizia try and convince others on trial that she was innocent. i‚Äôm also confused about the pacing of the movie, some scenes seemed to drag and some seemed to feel too quick. this was the fastest moving 2 hour and 30 minutes+ movie i‚Äôve ever seen",r0uxbw

hmdft2z,"Just saw it tonight. I wasn‚Äôt interested at first because Ridley Scott hasn‚Äôt made a film I‚Äôve liked in about 20 years but the polarizing reviews and talent attached had me interested. After seeing it, I‚Äôm genuinely confused by the people who feel that this is intentionally campy since the film presents itself for the most part as a pretty straightforward biopic. 

That being said, it felt like any attempt to have a distinct style came in the post production phase but all of them really ended up affecting my experience with the film. The most noticeable issue is the film‚Äôs color grading. This has to be one of the ugliest films I‚Äôve seen from an A-list Director in some time. A lot of the shots looked so awful and I kept thinking there was an intention behind this but as the film went on, there was no consistency to which scenes would be gray vs which ones would be a bright yellow. 

The soundtrack in this film was reminiscent of Cruella with songs coming in to remind you that this takes place in the 80‚Äôs but serving no other purpose to the scenes. I also found the score to be mostly intrusive and added noting to the overall film.

My biggest issue however was definitely the editing/structure of this film. Scenes would abruptly end with a lot of them not really serving the overall story and you just watch events happen back to back. Seriously, this film is structured like a Lifetime Original biopic.

Within the film, the camera was constantly shaking and each shot was usually just a close up of the actors delivering their lines which lead a lot to be desired. You would expect the costume design to shine in this film but it felt mainly bland and kind of cheap.

Despite all this, I actually found the performances to be the one redeeming factor of this film even though the accents were all questionable. Lady Gaga is serviceable throughout the film but I don‚Äôt really understand the Oscar hype. She‚Äôs good but the performance doesn‚Äôt really stick out in a way that I feel she deserves to be in that competition. I liked Adam Driver and thought he did a really great job of differentiating this character from other roles he‚Äôs played (though I might be biased since he‚Äôs my second favorite actor working rn). While I hesitate to call it a good performance, Jared Leto is very watchable throughout the film. He‚Äôs the one aspect that I can understand people finding purposely campy and despite how over the top he plays the role, he still hits the emotional beats and manages to feel like a completely different character. I had a fun time with Salma Hayek since I would completely forget that she was in the film and then she would pop up which always gave me an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment. That being said, it felt like most of her other performances and I just saw Salma instead of the character.

While I understand this film is a fun watch for most, I found the third act to just drag on which is surprising due to how quickly the film wraps up after the eventual murder takes place. The story doesn‚Äôt do a great job of differentiating itself from other biopics and all the technical elements really dragged this film down. I can‚Äôt help but feel if there wasn‚Äôt so much talent involved then people would probably not only be bored by this film but would flat out call it bad. For me it‚Äôs a 3/10",r0uxbw

One thing I would say: I'm going out on a limb and say that I actually liked the tonal conflict between comedic - almost self-aware - camp and grandiose epic. For me, those two registers worked surprisingly well for a film about the self-destruction of arrogant, rich idiots.

 I can't help but feel I got a perspective of how these characters (especially Gaga's character who is implied to have authorship of the narrative from the beginning and final scenes) viewed their own life stories, as a high stakes drama of unrecognised creative geniuses. But ultimately, they just looked greedy, arrogant and psychotic conduits of the personally embarrassing farce that is their family politics. That about sums up the real life story, for me",r0uxbw

Then, once the family fell out of ownership, Dominico takes over without having to do the scummy work and risk being found out.",r0uxbw

Would Maurizio not have sheperded the same kind of rejuvenation of the brand had he lived and continued to run it?

One of the first scenes in the movie is her forging her dad‚Äôs signature, as she discusses with said father about the way he‚Äôs buying things he can‚Äôt really afford. It‚Äôs kinda on-the-nose.

I know absolutely nothing about the real story, but in the narrative of this movie, what was implied to happen is that Patrizia (or whomever) signs the document, but maybe it was intentionally left unsigned by Domenica (maybe even with the active consent of Rodolfo) so he‚Äôd have dirt on Mauritzio if he ever needed leverage.",r0uxbw
hlzr9cz,">What was the significance of the man watching Adam Driver‚Äôs character in the very beginning of the movie? We see a man watching him from a car, and also from the riverbank when he‚Äôs on the boat. Who was that guy?

It's not explained in the film, for whatever reason - i.e. sloppy editing, or someone forgot - but in the *House of Gucci* book, Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons), the father of Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), Rodolfo is heavily implied to pay spies, security, and bodyguards to keep an eye on his son.

Rodolfo let Maurizio go to parties, but only to make connections that would ""benefit the Gucci family and company"". Guccio Gucci, Maurizio's grandfather, and Rodolfo, for example, idolized royalty; Rodolfo mentions [dressing Princess Grace of Monaco and Jackie Onassis in Gucci](https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/11026/how-grace-kelly-was-behind-one-of-guccis-most-memorable-prints).

Maurizio was also heavily constrained and sheltered in his upbringing, which Maurizio later refers to when he tells Rodolfo that he wants to marry Patrizia. However, again, for whatever reason, the context of this is missing entirely from the final *House of Gucci* film. Maurizio's every move and action was watched and monitored; hence, why Patrizia was basically stalking him in the beginning. The purpose was to sneak past Maurizio's security detail to speak with him.

In the book, Rodolfo Gucci is described as a highly controlling father, one who was already planning Maurizio's arranged marriage to the daughter of a wealthy shipping magnate, Marina Palma. However, Maurizio met Patrizia Reggiani at a party, and decided to later elope. Marina and Maurizio had grown up as childhood friends, and Rodolfo had his heart set on the idea of Maurizio marrying Marina, who was the daughter of a rich neighbor, Mr. Palma. Rodolfo also wanted Maurizio to marry Marina to add to the Gucci family's prestige and social standing.

When Maurizio refused to marry Marina to marry Patrizia instead, Rodolfo was furious. Like he did in the film, he basically exiled Maurizio from the Gucci family, and cut him off. Rodolfo hoped that Maurizio would eventually break things off with Patrizia and marry Marina, but he didn't.

Instead, Maurizio was ""adopted"" by the Reggianis, and married Patrizia. He also didn't tell his father, resulting in the scenes we see of the Guccis learning about the marriage from the paper.

Maurizio (Adam Driver) even later references this indirectly later in the film, after driving himself and Patrizia home from one of Aldo Gucci's parties: ""It's all bullshit. My family think they're royalty, but they're not. My grandfather, Guccio Gucci, was literally a busboy for the rich, royal, and famous in London."" This is referencing Rodolfo treating Maurizio like a ""royal prince"".

In today's terms, it would be like Prince Harry deciding to marry Meghan Markle, and then leaving the British royal family to live with his wife and children in the United States. A lot of British royalists/monarchists hate the fact that Prince Harry married Meghan Markle at all.

For Rodolfo Gucci, Patrizia Reggiani was his Meghan Markle.",r0uxbw
hmljquw,"> I was confused about the unsigned will. Did Jeremy Irons‚Äô character leave it unsigned on purpose, or was there some manipulation at play?

Its likely Domenico manipulated this part

>If so, the movie never explained who forged the signature right?

That being said, this is an adaptation. I have zero clue what their real relationship was like, and I‚Äôm pretty sure Maurizio was painted in a much better light than Patrizia.

And yeah, I felt terrible for her. Especially near the end as she cried for him to come home. Maybe they were both horrible at times, but I really am a strong supporter of fixing things.

hmpl6ey,"In the case of the Guccis, it was because they literally tried to become ""the new Italian royalty"" after the fall of the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy) in 1946. Their family got rich; and, thus, power-hungry.

Guccio Gucci, the Gucci patriarch - Maurizio's and Paolo's grandfather, and Rodolfo's and Aldo's father - was born in the era of the Kingdom of Italy (b. 1881, 20 years after Italian unification). He idolized the rich, famous, and especially royals, and sought the endorsement of the ruling [House of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy) for the Gucci company; possibly even an Italian knighthood for businessmen.

Guccio Gucci himself also originally worked for [Franzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franzi), the fashion house endorsed by the Savoy family, as well as the [Savoy Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Hotel) in London, and [Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compagnie_Internationale_des_Wagons-Lits). Franzi made its money by selling luxury goods to high-ranking European royals and nobles, which was a tactic that Gucci [later copied with selling luxury goods to Princess Grace of Monaco](https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/11026/how-grace-kelly-was-behind-one-of-guccis-most-memorable-prints).

However, when Italy became a Republic, and the Savoy royal family fled Italy, this left a power vacuum that greatly appealed to Guccio Gucci and his sons as an opportunity to elevate their family's wealth, influence, and social status. This is also indirectly referenced by Maurizio Gucci in the *House of Gucci* film, where he says, ""My family thinks they're royalty, but they're not.""

In the *House of Gucci* book, it's also mentioned that Rodolfo Gucci had originally planned an arranged marriage for Maurizio to the daughter of a wealthy Italian shipping magnate. Rodolfo basically saw his son as an ""Italian prince"", and himself as ""Italian royalty"", or high nobility.

To this end, in the 1950s, the Guccis also [adopted a ""family coat-of-arms"" as their logo](https://www.fixturescloseup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gucci-leather-goods-coat-of-arms-2.jpg), and proceeded to trademark the coat-of-arms so that it was synonymous with the family business.",r0uxbw

The short answer from the book is tax evasion/fraud. Maurizio Gucci was basically cooking the books and embezzling money from the Gucci company to fund his family's extravagant lifestyle. We also see InvestCorp confront him directly about this later when they offer to buy him out.

Italy's IRS were also after Maurizio due to his wife, Patrizia, forging his father's signature so that Maurizio could gain access to his shares in the Gucci company, and Gucci's money. This is also covered in the movie, with the scene where they tell Maurizio he has to pay an inheritance tax.

Also see: [""Gucci Heir Gets Suspended Sentence for Attempted Fraud""](https://apnews.com/article/e9ed4093b2324c6793835d1858787ed5) (c. 1988)

>Vittorio Ajello, the lawyer for Gucci, said the decision means Gucci will regain control of shares that will give him half of the company.  
>  
>**Gucci was accused of having arranged the falsification of the signature on the documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by making it appear that his father, Rodolfo, transferred ownership of the shares before his death in 1983.**

>Gucci‚Äôs ownership of the shares was not in question, only when the transfer was made. The court froze the shares to assure he could pay any fine levied in the tax fraud case.  
>  
>He had faced a possible penalty of three years in jail and a fine of about $23 million.  
>  
>However, the court fined Gucci only $750. It also gave him a one-year suspended sentence and said his criminal record will be expunged at the end of the year. **Gucci also must pay the inheritance tax on the shares.**  
>  
>The court also convicted Gucci employees Gian Vittorio Pilone and Ciro De Vincenzo, the notary that authenticated the signatures, of the same charges. The two were given the same suspended sentence and fine. The court also prohibited De Vincenzo from acting as a notary for one year.

I mean, she didn't even seem to care about her daughter. There's a scene of her arriving at home, clearly more interested in shopping than caring for her child. Her kid was only useful to blackmailing Maurizio into staying married to her.",r0uxbw

> I‚Äôm pretty sure Maurizio was painted in a much better light than Patrizia.

This is is the reverse of the truth. Patrizia is painted much better than she really was and Maurizio was turned pathetic despite every evidence saying in the contrary.   


This current obsession with making vile people likeable is not sitting with me right. Ted Bundy obsession, films making psychopaths and murders to be charismatic. This one does the same, throw in some fiction to make the audience playing field level instead of making Maurizio the victim that he was.   


So much doesn't make sense due to no time markers in the film. The film is shown and edited in a way that made us think that Maurizio and Patrizia were separated AFTER Maurizio slept and started seeing Paola.   


The truth is apparently Maurizio and Pat separated in 1985 and Maurizio met and started dating Paola in 1990. This entire line was blurred in the film and shifted some of the blame of Maurizio's murder on Maurizio himself, to make the emotional response to the incident neutral.",r0uxbw

It felt very bitter when he was with that other girl and wouldn't even see or talk to Patrizia. Like, the least you can do is answer the phone and talk to her.

htzop7y,I liked Maurizio so much more when he said those things in the car after the uncles bday. It aligned with my own views of also somewhat coming from a high upper middle class family surrounded by so many disgustingly blatant shows of wealth. (Not like the Guccis but ye) watching him become justjke the rest of his family which he said he was not like was well. A betrayal to his character I liked quite a lot from the start.

I'm so fucking sick of movies saying ""we made it bad on purpose"" and that meaning it's good.

There are multiple scenes where she handles the intersection of business and family to the detriment of his relationships with his family, and you can see on his face or hear through the dialogue that he is not on board and is slowly becoming more disgusted.

An obvious example is the ""It's time to take out the trash"" scene during which he says, ""But they're my family.""

Another obvious example is when Leto/Paolo comes to confront the two of them and it's very clear that Patrizia pulled something (I can't remember the details since it's been a few days) about which he had absolutely zero clue that caused a complete breakdown in the relationship with his cousin. He goes along with it in the moment because she's his wife, but that's clearly where he loses any remnants of faith in her.

I thought he came off like a psychopath switching off his feelings like that, even though they showed them fight. One fight didn't justify how he seemed to not love or care for her at all, just because she was trying to get him control of his family's company. 

He went on to do all the stuff she wanted him to do, so it didn't make much sense storywise why they couldn't have become a power couple at the head of this huge company. 

I know it was a real story, but they didn't do much to explain the real story or make it feel legit.

They once successfully got the US Attorney General to successfully block the publication of a memoir by an ex-mobster who was the first one to publicly admit that the Mafia existed. It was the first time an attorney general tried to ban a book and this was only due to pressure from President LBJ. The memoir wasn't published but The Valachi Papers, interviews with the mobster by a journalist who was editing the memoirs was allowed.

He hired a teenage girl fresh out of the American equivalent of high school, Penny Armstrong, to take care of his horses.

Guess who Paolo practically forced into being his mistress? Penny Armstrong. After Paolo's death, Penny recounted how Paolo had spent himself into poverty, showering her with lavish gifts, to coerce her into having sex with him.

Penny caved to Paolo's demands. By the time Paolo died, he had fathered 2-3 children with her, but left Penny and his illegitimate children homeless and destitute. It reads like something King Henry VIII would do with his royal mistresses.",r0uxbw

I understood that Patrizia enjoyed the finer things in life and would have loved to marry into a rich family, but they portray their romance as legitimate. That they married for love, not money. 

Later, she's seeing the company mismanaged and thinks she can do better. It didn't appear to be a specifically laid out scheme for her to marry into the Gucci family and take control of it. Whether that was her plan in real life, I couldn't say, but the movie did not clearly portray her as a gold-digger. It was ambiguous. 

Later, after she does start enacting these plans to get her husband control of the company, they don't do a good job of explaining it all. Her motives seemed to be that she could run the place better. That the actual Guccis were squandering the prestige associated with their name and soon the company would be worthless. 

I feel the editing was not great. It skipped over key scenes that would have made everyone's motivations clearer. Honestly, even the murder for hire thing felt like it came out of nowhere. Maurizio came off semi-psychopathic, but she's the one who was a deranged murderer!

* sardonic master (denigrating Sebastian)

""Sugar daddy/sugar baby"" relationships are consensual. This was decidedly not.

I say this as a young woman who has worked as a stable hand before myself...there are men, rich men, who wield their money as a weapon to force young stable hands and riders into unwanted sexual relationships. The issue is also rampant in the horse world as a whole, as seen with my old trainer, George Morris. They're sexual predators.

These are usually old men much older, and wealthier, than their younger victim(s), who are poor employees or trainees. Morris's victim of choice - as he is gay - were young men that he raped repeatedly, but Paolo preyed on young women, like Penny.

Paolo's father, Aldo, also had a history of 'seducing' his employees (i.e. Bruna Palombo).

From Wikipedia:

>In 1990, \[59-year-old Paolo\] separated from his second wife Jenny Garwood after having an affair with 19-year-old Penny Armstrong. He had two children with her out of wedlock, Alyssa and Gabrielle.

From the article ""From stable girl to a Gucci mistress.. and back serving drinks in the pub; EXCLUSIVE: PENNY ENJOYED pounds 26 MILLION LUXURY LIFESTYLE.. NOW SHE LIVES IN POVERTY."" (c. 1998):

>Penny Armstrong was 19 when she got a job at Gucci's stables. She loved horses, and had trained with them after leaving school. **It was poorly-paid work, but it was all she had ever wanted to do.**  
>  
>Before she met Paolo, her life had been quite normal. Her father was a computer engineer, and she had gone to the local comprehensive school. **Nothing had prepared her for romance with a multi-millionaire designer more than twice her age (59 vs. 19).**  
>  
>FROM their first meeting in the stable yard, Gucci seemed determined to pursue the flame-haired teenager.  
>  
>""He insisted on shaking my hand, which was very dirty, because I'd been working,"" says Penny. ""I felt awkward, but he was charming to me. He was an attractive, older man and I was surprised he bothered talking to me.  
>  
>""A few months later, he asked me if I would like to go to the States, to learn American horse-training techniques. I jumped at the chance. **It never occurred to me that he wanted me there for any other reason.**  
>  
>""Paolo invited me to dinner to discuss the trip. He seemed determined to put me at my ease, and make me enjoy myself. He was very charismatic. It went well, and we talked about everything. He asked me if I would like to see his house. Of course, I did.""

>**Penny went back to living on the farm, but it was very difficult. The other staff knew what was going on, and made snide comments about the affair. Then Paolo asked Penny to move in with him. She still wasn't in love \[with him\], but he was persistent.**

Based on Penny's description, she obviously wasn't interested in Paolo, but because she worked for him and could lose a job she loved if she refused his advances. Penny gave into Paolo's sexual and romantic advances because she had no choice.

Even when Penny tried to say ""no"", Paolo wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer. That's rape, or at the very least, sexual coercion, as he pressured her into having sex with him.

It's [like Catherine Parr marrying King Henry VIII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZO8KtR4m2o)...Catherine didn't want to marry Henry, a much-older and wealthier King with health issues, but Henry wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer. It was either sleep with the old man, or be punished by losing everything.

What you're doing isn't beneficial. It's doing everything you can to survive.

The rest of the article also reads like Penny developed Stockholm Syndrome from being trapped in an unwanted sexual relationship with Paolo, and bearing his children.

At the very least, she clearly developed some mental health issues, as by the time Paolo died, she had been so heavily manipulated into being dependent on him that she went into a  months-long state of catatonia and depression. She stopped taking care of the horses, and several of them died from neglect, which Penny [was later prosecuted for](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gucci-mistress-banned-for-cruelty-to-horses-1234384.html).

At the very least, Penny became attached to, but didn't love, her boss/abuser, as she stated. [Trauma bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_bonding) is unfortunately very common in situations like these.",r0uxbw

One of the reason why Morris got away with what he did for a long time was because systemic homophobia prevented many of his male victims from speaking out. When Morris's victims finally came forward, he then tried to use [the Kevin Spacey defense](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/choose-now-live-gay-man-kevin-spacey-emotional/story?id=50804057).

In some degrees, the defense worked, because many sided with Morris.",r0uxbw
hmacdhj,"You clearly don't know anything about what it is like to work in the horse world, nor about the equestrian/horse world and industry. I was wholly in this world from age 7 well into my 20s. It is a well-known fact that people like Paolo Gucci are treated as sexual predators. They're also more recently banned for doing stuff like this.

Penny Armstrong was also banned for neglect of horses related to Mr. Gucci, and as Penny herself stated, she was ostracized and shunned by her coworkers. Everyone knew what was going on, but did nothing about it, because Mr. Gucci could literally destroy them with his wealth and power. He could end your career, your job.

Again, this is something that is an ""open secret"" within the horse world, especially with the rich and powerful within that world (i.e. George Morris). It's only very recently that organizations like the FEI have taken open action against these men.

Please don't continue to argue and debate just because you were told you were wrong about something by someone who has lived experience in the field. I am telling you, as someone who was in this world for years, you are wrong.

It's easy to deny, argue, debate, dismiss, and brush it off as an outsider, but I've seen this happen over the years, and do does everyone else in horse world. We're not stupid.

Yeah, certainly seems like you don't care about him and it's only through headlines, suure.",r0uxbw

hlxmt1a,I mean In the video he linked he is  saying it on camera. You could argue he is just piling up the ridiculous rumors he had heard at that point since the interviewer brought it up. But he definitely did say it on camera.,r0uxbw
hlx5vqb,"No, you **literally** just linked an article about how he changed his story after saying he did it. 

Did you even read the headline of the article you just linked (which is the same one I linked because it mentions **multiple people‚Äôs corroborating statements**)? Or watch the video of him saying it with pride to a reporter on a red carpet?

Denying it *weeks* weeks later doesn‚Äôt change that he smiled for the cameras while saying he specifically did those things.",r0uxbw

Last time - he said he did it, changing the story weeks later doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he SAID HE DID IT TO A REPORTER WHILE ON CAMERA AND SMILED ABOUT IT. THE ‚ÄúFAKE STORY‚Äù CAME FROM JARED LETO.
