evsxebo,"Lots of reasons to love this movie. In addition to all that's been mentioned I personally loved it because of how accurate their portrayal of these less travelled parts of China are. Travelled through China for about a month last year and it was incredible.

&#x200B;

Even the hotel employee's fascination with Billie's American background was spot on. My fiance is of Chinese descent and people in general were incredibly curious about our way of life back here in the states as Asian Americans.

The fucking swarm of taxi drivers gave me mild PTSD lol",ckwhml
evxiun1,"This was a fantastic movie. One element in particular that I appreciated was that it didn't default to a Western vs. Eastern philosophy thing where the Western way of doing things inevitably comes out on top.* 

I come from a non-Chinese Asian culture and it's all too often that a story will get to the point where the hardass Asian parents have no choice but to admit that their child embracing Western individualism is what made them succeed or whatever. That might be true in isolated cases (Bohemian Rhapsody smacks of this, for instance, and is obviously based on a true story; alternatively, Crazy Rich Asians I think suffers from this and is entirely fictional), but it's so hard to articulate (mainly to non-Eastern friends, or even my non-Eastern wife) why some of us from Eastern cultures tend to adhere to seemingly strange or authoritarian/rigid social norms between ourselves and our parents or broader family. And when the only kind of film you see is the exceptional story where the immigrant succeeds in spite of their rigid cultural upbringing, that shines a really, really negative light on Eastern culture as a whole, which is very unfair.

This film did an excellent job of speaking to the opposite of that, that Asian cultures that give individualism (or American exceptionalism, as it may be) a smaller role to play in the lives of people and their families is not a lesser path, but an alternate path that is meritorious in its own way. It's nice to know that there is an uptick in those kinds of projects.

*I realize that this is also based on a true story, but I think even 5-10 years ago, it would be difficult for me to imagine a movie like this being made.",ckwhml
evtu51i,"Saw this a couple months ago at Atlanta Film Festival, had a Q&A with Awkwafina and Lulu Wang afterwards which was great. 

According to Wang, the real Nai Nai, who's still around of course, still has no idea. She was even on set for portions of filming, including the goodbye scene, and giving instruction to the actress playing her, but the details of the movie and character were still kept from her.",ckwhml

evtgeyf,Is it weird the part that hit me the hardest was near the end when Nai Nai was imparting her wisdom to Billi about not worrying too much with not getting the fellowship and that things will work out?,ckwhml
evs00or,English speaking Billi and Mandarin speaking Billi are two entirely different characters and Awkwafina nailed that perfectly.,ckwhml
ex87vdi,Anyone else lose it with the end scene and the shot of Nai Nai waving back to them? I can't think about it or else I start crying.,ckwhml
evsorfr,"Billi's mom (Jian, played by Diana Lin) was an awesome character to me. I thought she brought a lot to the story with her dinner table argument with Nai Nai's niece about the U.S. and China and their children, and then with her scenes with Billi. I thought it was pretty useful for characterization to have her talk about her tougher relationship with Nai Nai, and just her various back-and-forths with Billi. 

Awkwafina definitely deserves awards buzz for her lead role, but Lin is awesome too in the supporting role.",ckwhml
evvuxzj,"I loved this movie so much. There's so much this movie does so well, from its incredible cast to the tight direction to details like billi's broken mandarin (which I wish was played up even more tbh), the seamless switching between languages, and the uncomfortable discussions of ""do you like America or here more?"". It's so warm and you can genuinely feel the love and history between this family while also being presented with a compelling argument behind why they decided to keep this from nai nai. 

A specific scene I wanted to point out was the uncle's discussion with billi about eastern culture's emphasis on being part of the whole versus the west's more individualistic mindset. It's an amazing encapsulation of the difference between these two cultures and the uncle's restraint and delivery of his monologue was phenomenal.

Another scene which I really loved was Nai Nai showing off her stretching routine to Billi, especially the decision to set the camera in a single, narrow pov and allow them exit and enter the frame as they run around the scene. It's such a smart way to show off their chemistry and is one of many examples of Wang's excellent directing.

Finally, until I read more about the real story, I also loved how Nai Nai's actress was able to sell you on the ambiguity of whether or not she actually knows what the family is doing.",ckwhml
evrl8xl,"There's a lot to say about this movie, but all I want to say right now is that Awkwafina was outstanding. She will definitely get an Oscar nomination, and I'm all here for it.

evup4ay,My audience started cheering at the end when it was revealed that Nai Nai was still alive.,ckwhml
evx5wrb,"I was worried this would be too saccharine or preachy, but it really wasn't. As someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture, it did a great job of showing the contrasting ideologies without picking sides. I was fascinated. 

Really visually beautiful too, with great color choices. That scene with Billi talking to her dad and uncle in the hotel lobby at night was gorgeous. And at the spa. 

One of those rare films that makes me feel sad that it's over and I can't be immersed in its world anymore. Totally exceeded expectations",ckwhml

I was like...yup...that’s sort of really how it is.


 It all looked so amazing.",ckwhml
evrlo8f,"Profoundly beautiful, intimate and melancholy. Balances humor and drama perfectly. Lulu does an amazing job using the device of dramatic irony (something the audience knows that a character doesn't - in this case the diagnosis) to put us in the shoes of a family. It makes us connect to Awkwafina's character even further and the intimate blocking makes us feel like we are right there next to her, which engages us in the narrative a way too few films even try to make us do. I loved this movie, and it hit close to home in a few ways having recently lost a grandmother and having not seen one in 5+ years. 

This is one of A24's finest acquisitions, and I cannot wait to see Lulu's next work. I loved the cast and I hope Awkwafina gets the dramatic break she deserves. A much earned Oscar nom and even win (depending on how this year shapes up) can certainly help.

10/10",ckwhml
evrtl0k,"ffs, make it a wide release already! I've been waiting patiently for it to show in a theater near my home (in the DFW metroplex), so that I can watch with my family, but this slow release is such a buzzkill. I want to watch with them (and support A24 with more money), but at the same time, I don't know if this is the widest release it'll get, so I might have to watch it by myself, or else it may be pulled from theaters before I know it. 

A24's *Midsommar* has run its course in theaters, and *The Farewell* has had a pretty respectable Per Theater Gross for the past three weeks. Just replace *Midsommar* with *The Farewell* already!",ckwhml

ewaknyp,"This film hits hard for me being a Chinese American. Facing the mortality of a grandmother that looks, acts and speaks like your own was so heartbreaking to watch. I came out of the movie theater devastated wanting to call my parents and grandparents to let them know I love them. That culture of not telling people bad news because it's ""too much trouble"" and to shoulder all the emotional trauma is so real for Chinese people. The cinematography was beautiful. The compositions of people, places and objects were so pleasing to watch. The soundtrack felt wide and encompassed the film to feeling bigger than just the story of this particular family. The dialogue was real and the way the actors and actresses portrayed them was almost identical because I see the same mannerisms in my own family. The way Nai Nai slaps Billi when she feels happy and calls her ""stupid girl"" but means it in the most loving way possible. This film broke my heart. Lulu Wang deserves all the praise she will get.",ckwhml
evru5r3,"Really loved this moved, I thought Awkwafina did amazing. I legit found myself growing more and more concerned for the grandmother’s well-being towards the end.

fe01hq7,"Just saw this movie today and as an Asian american, it really hit home for me.

I didn't see this mentioned yet but one of the most beautiful scenes in the movie occurs after the earring-searching scene and right before the wedding- it is when Billi dreams about her grandfather standing at the window of her hotel room smoking and looking out and when she wakes up, all that's left of his presence/her dream is the smoke drifting softly away.  The cinematography captures exactly how it feels to dream about someone you love who is gone from your life - the red glow from the lights, the framing, it was just perfect.  The music, too, is exquisite.

Glad I rented this.",ckwhml
evrm6kq,"My Number 2 movie this year, only behind The Last Black Man in San Francisco. It was such a beautiful story.  And so well acted.   Awkwafina is at the top of my Best Actress list (it’s still early since almost no awards contenders have released). 

I cried quite a bit during the final 3rd.",ckwhml
evrwewz,The older brother’s speech during the wedding was one of the saddest moments I’ve ever seen in a movie,ckwhml
evrl7ws,"Really enjoyed The Farewell. From the trailer I thought it might hit me much harder, but it was weirdly a kind of joyous movie which was interesting. Like the grandma was too busy being happy to be with her family that any sad feelings were just undertones and she was pushing them away with her innocent joy. 

I loved how the first scene sets up the themes, when she's on the phone with Nai Nai from New York. She's already lying to her in small ways, saying she's wearing a hat. Not explaining the stranger she talked to was a stranger or that no one was gonna rip her earrings out. Easier to agree with her than explain the entirety of New York culture. There's actually a lot of white lying in the movie which I thought was interesting. 

Awkwafina is so good here. I've always liked her whole vibe despite her roles generally being either too loud or too quiet (Crazy Rich and Oceans 8 respectively) but this was a chance to shine and she nailed it. Really liked the scene where they were looking for the earring and she started confessing all her feelings about moving. And of course she has a ton of great non verbal acting as well. 

I enjoyed the style and the look of the movie. I felt like I wasn't seeing any typical depiction of China I'd ever seen, but rather an eclectic and real one with so many different aesthetics. For example I loved the gaudy diamond studded hat Auntie would wear. 

Really enjoy any movie that can get me to understand those totally different from me, so all of the talk about the difference between how the west sees their lives as their own and the personal choice to hold the burden of looming death for your relatives was really interesting. Loved the scene where they were at Grandpa's grave and had to open all the food so he could eat it and they argued about whether or not he should smoke. Like, obviously they don't think he's going to eat the food, but it's the myth that makes them feel better and if you ignore the smallest part of it you might as well just not take part in it. 

Overall, quite good but it didnt emotionally devastate me like I thought it would. Some really interesting musings on culture and lying and some funny highs and sad lows. Would recommend, 7/10.",ckwhml
evzmdqh,"Anyone else think this was a rough opening weekend for the line: “we have problems in America. Guns, healthcare”",ckwhml

evrlkdk,You wanna put the dog in the cast pls?,ckwhml
eyw3rth,What should be understood is that the grandmother knew she had cancer and knew that her family was hiding it from her. We know this because she had done the same thing when her husband was dying. She isn't stupid. But she played along because she is honoring her family and Chinese tradition by not discussing such things.,ckwhml
ex2ze59,"The acting performances were all spectacularly nailed. I especially enjoyed the conversation Awkwafina's uncle and dad are having **(smoking scene)**. I resonated a lot with what the uncle says (the divide between the East & West; and how the entire concept of freedom and your life belonging to just you, is much more prevalent in the West... so much so, that even hearing about someone's life not just belonging to themselves, but also their family & friends is shocking and **”repulsive”**). 

Another scene that was brilliantly executed was the uncle's speech at the wedding. It was so powerful, and done with so much raw emotion, that our entite theatre went quiet and you could hear the audience sobbing.

I have a newfound respect for chinese culture, and have been learning more about it since I watched the film last week. I am excited to see what project Lulu Wang will direct next. 

**9/10**",ckwhml
fcbcniu,"Been binging a lot of films over the holiday period but have to say this is probably my favourite film I've seen this year.

It means more culturally to me as I'm Chinese but  was born in the UK, so the humour hits home a lot more. 

The acting was fantastic, not just from the main 2, but from everyone, I couldn't really say anyone could've done a better job with what they were given.

Awkwafina was fine and I was expecting a bit more considering the buzz but Zhao Shuzen was fantastic and incredibly natural. From the moments she was just being herself to the little heart wrenching cutaways where she's struggling, all her scenes were amazing.

I did expect Nai Nai to hint or outright reveal she knew but was pretty happy with the ending and the film overall.",ckwhml
exxfz2q,"I just saw this and went into it not knowing what the film was about at all, as my friend dragged me along randomly. It hit deep with me. My grandmother passed 4 months ago and it was my first experience losing someone who I actually felt emotionally connected to. All of those slow moments where everything just paused... I could feel every feeling. Like right before the sister told Nai Nai the benign shadows or Billi’s dad on the bed from behind. I am actually spreading my grandma’s ashes at the beach tomorrow, so I lost it at the Grandpa’s memorial. 

I kept having flashbacks to moments in my life over these past 4 months—don’t think a movie has made me cry so much. Growing up Vietnamese, I also have family who don’t show deeper emotions. Because of my family’s outlook, they’ve been very okay about my grandma and I feel like I’m taking it the hardest, so it was cathartic seeing all these relatives in the film going through their emotions both out in the open and in private. The blips of humor were so well placed and the contrast of bright colors (balloon walls during an intense monologue) against the sullen moods was great. I want to take my folks to see this and maybe I can be more vulnerable with them about me missing my Bà Nội.",ckwhml
eypfof7,"Saw this last night.

Movie of the year so far IMo. Absolutely deserves *at least* a Screenplay nomination at the Oscars, and I wouldn't be against Director, Score, and Actress. 

The ending turned me into a slobbering, crying mess. It's been a while since a movie did that to me (maybe Moonlight or La La Land?)

Beautiful stuff. This and The Souvenir prove that semi-autobiographical biopics are great because they truly come from the heart. 

In related news, I've been listening to [Come Healing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAHS5xjgC-s) non-stop since last night. There is no better power couple in Hollywood currently than Wang & Barry Jenkins.",ckwhml
ew80tfw,"A scene no one really mentions that I think set the tone for the movie was one of the scenes in the beginning when Billie was at the birthday party with her friends. For me, it kinda set the tone for the kind of world that Billie lives in because I have been at birthday parties that look similar to that and compared to the rest of the film, it felt so American. And now, she has to deal with a whole other culture that she is a part of but doesn't relate to, especially with the part on withholding information from Nai Nai. This movie was so brilliant, I love it.",ckwhml
evs042h,"This one of the best movies of the year. I saw this at a festival in may and couldnt get it out of my head so i had to see it again. 

It is so self assured and soooo funny. It reminds me a lot of Lady Bird. A lot of verve and flavor in a tightly wrapped story. 

and dat post script. 

And Awkwafina is a lock for an oscar nod.",ckwhml
fc1m2gp,"Best scene for me was when the Japanese dad explains the differences in the East vs the West in regards to telling her the truth. The idea that they are carrying the burden for her I guess was maybe obvious if you reflect on it? But to hear it laid out made for a great scene.

Also I feel like if you're Chinese there's just so many parallels. They really nailed the ""Asian family"" thing. To outsiders it might feel like stereotypes but they are spot on.",ckwhml
evzt9zy,[deleted],ckwhml
ex0b0ad,"Incredible movie for me. I don't know why, but there was never a good moment to cry until the end in the car on the way back, but the movie retained a lasting tension in that all characters almost seem full to bursting with the weight of guilt.

Of course Billi and Nai Nai were excellent characters, but I think one that also deserves mention is the uncle from Japan. I think he really tried to express the sentiment of Eastern collectivist philosophy well, and the movie backs him up in his measures. I'm glad that they don't paint him as in the wrong, but like the difference between China and America, just different.

A mild complaint of sorts for the movie was that ""stupid child"" perhaps seems like it doesn't capture the subtext of that phrase properly. I keep mentally correcting it to ""silly child"" as it is meant to be said playfully and affectionately.",ckwhml
exa9b5x,"I thought the film’s pace and tenor couldn’t have been better. I can’t help but think those who critique it for being “plodding” or too artsy and pretentious should have spent their time and money on a Hollywood blockbuster. I also found it very laugh-out-loud humorous in parts. The best funny isn’t made of jokes with punchlines. In my opinion, the finest laughter stems from the profound (and sometimes subtle) ironies of life that we all (or some of us) can relate to.",ckwhml
exkgumu,"Last year, I watched Crazy Rich Asians and dragged my mother with me to support the film and this year, I ended up bringing both my parents to see it. I’m a child of Chinese immigrants, born and raised in the US so I went into it thinking that it was nuts to hide the diagnosis from a patient (also aggravated by the fact that I had my own stage 4 cancer diagnosis) but came out of the film with a deeper appreciation for the Chinese way of doing things. For people in the culture, it seems expected and is kinder to withhold the truth even if it seems cruel in my own Western one. 

This sort of film probably suited my parents better than CRA because while their English is good-ish, being mostly in Chinese made it easy for them to understand the story. And later, I found out that my own family had done a similar thing with my grandfather when he was dying from throat cancer. They didn’t tell him about it until he was near death and my parents agree that for him and for Nai Nai, it was the right decision.

For me, I speak Cantonese and don’t know any Mandarin so while I could tell Awkwafina’s accent was off, it didn’t bother me that much. And I was struck by the story of the two brothers, both expats but one who feels like he is and always will be Chinese and the other who feels Americanized. It’s like both of them are my parents who feel a deep love for their motherland and their Chinese identity but can’t deny they have been changed living in the US for so long.

And then the mother! It was creepy because it felt like she was my mother. I’ve had that conversation with my own mother about how she can’t express emotion and it was deeply hurtful. But she cracks towards the end and I’ve since seen the cracks in my own mother and hits you so much harder when it happens. 

And that speech by the older son — that’s where I started to cry because I felt like a lot of his sentiments would be echoed by my own father towards his mother and it made me sad thinking about it while I was sitting next to him in the theater.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I certainly related to it, but it kinda felt strange because it felt like it was building up to something but in the end, it just kinda was. And then it ended just like that. I don’t tend to watch movies like this all that often or ever so maybe this is the feel of an indie/Sundance movie. Certainly, there were some parts (the bird, the callgirl) that I don’t quite get but I’m okay with that. I definitely want to see it again and see if there’s anything I missed.",ckwhml

Wang’s film adds a deeper story about deception to family separation and it’s a fantastic script and has a great pace. 

In many conversation scenes, you can see other faces fighting different emotions—the cousin getting married is frequently quivering and on the verge of tears—and that only adds to already strong acting across the board.

They still treat me like a little kid even though I have my own life. The wonton scene was especially reflective of my own interactions with my mom where she would ask me for input on shit that she already made her mind up about.

Also loved how it depicted mainland China and those family interactions, felt very organic and real.

the conversation they had about america vs china, and why one would leave or go to the other, is a real conversation my family has had and will always have. 

Nai Nai was amazing, she really did the ""strong, fun, stern grandma"" role wonders. Tzi Mai was awesome here too - im glad the parents were given time here for their own mini-arcs.

Awkwafina absolutely killed this role. i already thought she'd be a star, but this proved that she can do more than just be the goofy sidekick.",ckwhml
ex08y2q,"I just got back from seeing it and wanted to give my opinion on it here. Overall, it was very good and definitely accomplished its goal. I'm consistently surprised by first time writer/directors' abilities to make these exceedingly difficult movies and do it with such assuredness that you'd think it was a well-established talent. In this particular case, Lulu Wang does a good job with the emotion of the film. It would have been easy to make this a standard weepy drama. Instead, though, Wang has made a film that is extremely emotionally intense. I didn't cry or tear up very much, but I found myself moved and floored in a way I haven't felt in quite some time.

One thing I need to ensure that I highlight is the acting. The performances here are all quite good. There are two in particular I want to highlight. First, Awkwafina is great in her first dramatic role. She sells the emotion and you feel the connection between her and her grandmother. The second is Diana Lin as Billi's mother Jian. Without giving anything away, she has one of the more important arcs in the film and she really delivers. There are two scenes in particular between these two characters that are maybe my favorites in the whole film. They both bring their A-game and work great together.

My main problem with the film is actually a mixed element for me. Wang uses a lot of long takes and slow-mo that ends up not entirely working. I suspect her goal of using them was to really allow the emotion to simmer and linger for as long as possible. In some scenes, you really feel this and it works well to make you feel what the characters are feeling. She uses it so much, however, that the effects started to wear off and it became more tiresome than anything else. There are two reasons I can think of for why this was used so much. The first is draw out the runtime. At only 100 minutes, the film is already fairly short and the credits take up a fair bit of time as well. My suspicion is that Wang wanted to ensure that she adhered to the generally agreed upon 90 minute cutoff point for feature length films. The second reason, perhaps, is, being a first time director, she saw that she had a good device available to her and decided to use it as much as possible out of excitement. While this is understandable and in some respects admirable, I think she failed to see the potential drawbacks of this.

Overall, though, the film is a nice package that succeeds in its goal. I'm glad I saw it as I learned quite a bit about Chinese culture that I didn't know before. I think it may be a film that needs to be seen multiple times to really take it all in and experience the film's full potential. I do recommend seeing it in theaters if you have the chance. We need to support smaller films and films from new talent as much as possible so we may see many more in the future.",ckwhml

hlvp04d,"Late to the chat! It was a great film and having both lived extensively in China and the West made it hit even harder. One thing me and my wife discussed though: the uncle’s pivotal speech about “taking on the emotional burden”. It worked well in the film, but in real life I think it’s a bit simplistic. I don’t think either route is “easier”; rather, the choice is more reflective of the wider Western/Eastern cultural divide expressed in the film with the West more focused on the rights and agency of the individual (ie telling a person gives them that agency), whereas the East is more focused on collectivism: sharing fortune and hardship and decisions/responsibilities as a group. The idea that it’s “easier” to give a loved one the worst news possible doesn’t strike true to me. Although I guess this idea perhaps does inform the Chinese decision, even though it’s basis in reality is questionable. And of course the opposite is true for the Western perspective. For me the message is: Sometimes it’s much easier to just act according to the dictums of our culture guidebook (East or West or inbetween) rather than have to soul search and grapple with the best choice for ourselves. Though in making this observation I’m probably already showing my own cultural bias!",ckwhml

evs0ql6,"*all spoilers!*



I think Nai Nai knew all along.  She couldn’t hold it in anymore when she waved goodbye to Billi.

(So, if she knew, why did she let them continue the lie?)  She knew the custom like everyone else, and she did the same for her own husband.  She wanted to let her family see her as happy and not sick, giving them memories of a wedding weekend instead of gathering in a hospital room.  She organized the banquet as a party for everyone, because that’s what parties are.  Remember how her sons said that they’d carry the burden of her sadness?  She carried her own, and she knew that she could help her family — all of them — if she happily cared for them like they’ve known her to do all of their lives.  It’s as if she was saying, don’t worry, I’m satisfied, I know what’s happening — just as she didn’t tell Billi on the phone that she was at the hospital.

There are so many other pieces, too, that I thought were interesting.  How Lulu Wang shot all the family meals from outside the circle, all except the drinking game when we’re finally brought inside.  The picture on Nai Nai’s bedroom wall of her and her husband in the PLA.  The nanny who can’t read because she never went to school (a servant class?).  Lil’ Nai Nai setting aside her own life for years (years!) to take care of her big sister.  The prostitute looking out the hotel room’s door, as some things haven’t changed in the big city.  Billi not feeling at home in either America or China since everything has changed so much.  The musicians at the wedding, adding traditional flavor like we expect in a movie — then packing up and leaving like the hired guns they are, now fully modernized.  Billi’s dad saying that he’s American because he carries an American passport, then his brother saying, “No matter what passport I have, I am Chinese.”  And how so much of the film was around food, being prepared in the kitchen or being eaten at the big family-sized table; yet Lulu hardly dwelled on any single dish, not until Nai Nai fed Billi like she was a little girl again.

God I loved this movie.",ckwhml
ewof0jd,"I like the movie, but not sure I agree with its 8.75/10 rating on Rotten Tomatoes. My biggest issue is that the movie is rather plodding at times with how it lingers a bit too long on some shots (I had a similar issue with Moonlight). It gives the movie a sense of artsy pretentiousness (especially with the soundtrack). Though that's not to say the cinematography is amazing. 

I am impressed by Awkwafina's acting in particular, the monologue scene that follows Aiko's earing search was a highlight for her. The actress who played Nai Nai deserve kudos too. Everyone else was also good. 

The movie definitely seem to tackle ethnocentrism and American arrogance(Billi and her parents) given how it ends with Nai Nai beating the odds. I'm not Chinese American so I couldn't relate to the overall plot though.

ew9fwis,"First of all, I echo a lot of the positive sentiments people have had of this movie. It’s super genuine, thought-provoking, and personally relevant even though I’m a non-Chinese Asian-American. I especially enjoyed Awkwafina’s performance compared to her part as Peik Lin in Crazy Rich Asians. Her portrayal didn’t particularly impress me since it felt like more of an extension of her own boisterous personality rather than actual acting. Meanwhile, I agree with others’ praise of Awkwafina as Billi where I think she did a great job in pulling us into that world and conveying all the things Billi felt/experienced in the movie. If CRA had me doubtful of Awkwafina’s career, The Farewell has made me do a 180 turn back onto the Awkwafina train (though I’m not 100% sure about whether I think she deserves the Oscar nom as some are suggesting haha)

Funnily enough, when talking to a Chinese national friend of mine (who hadn’t seen the film) about the Farewell, she noted that the movie was more suited to me than her. CRA had a less-than stellar reception in China since it offered nothing new for Chinese movie-goers in comparison to majority white America, so I wonder what kind of reception will have with the larger population of Chinese nationals or other non-American Asians.",ckwhml

This was just an alright movie. But It's the perfect movie-movie. It is exactly what you are expecting and is competently made.

The grandma stole the show. The dad was great. The Uncle/brother was great. Even the mom had a soft spot with me. But Awkwafina could have been played by anyone. And her 'standout' drama scene was lackluster. Ultimately disappointed with her based on the praise going in. And that also being said, I don't think I've seen any movie of hers before that.

Yes, it's still good to have a huge blockbuster full of Asians (even if the male lead is unfortunately half white) but it's mostly a show about the Crazy Rich than it is about Asians.  So even though some of the family dynamics with daughters and mothers were explored, it didn't really communicate much about the Asian experience, or for that matter the Asian-American experience through the eyes of Constance Wu's character.

Awkwafina is getting a lot of praise but personally her horrendous mandarin really took me out of the movie. Her character lived in China until she was six and she regularly converses with her grandma. There’s no way her mandarin would be that bad. She sounded like someone who never spoke in mandarin before. 

I also thought some of the scenes were a little try hard in the artistic department. The opera singing during the wedding and awkwafina playing the piano just felt out of place and amateur. 

I will say though that I related to this movie a whole lot and the family characters were all very well casted. I swear some conversations that they have seem to be lifted from my life.

But there was food in so many scenes because that’s where so many family discussions take place.  Lulu said that a producer also asked if she could write some scenes that weren’t around the dinner table, like having everyone take a walk in the park.

Therefore, to me, that scene spoke to me in a way that reminded me of the finality of those last moments.

evuxfjw,">  you don't get the sense that the film is criticizing this progress. Its tone is one more akin to acceptance, as if the film's citizens are tacitly saying ""our home is changing, but it's still ours.""

I did. It's not criticizing it to the level of ""it shouldn't have happened"", but it is criticizing it in at least asking the question of what is the deep cost of material improvement in terms of emotional and spiritual well-being? Just as Billi's emigration is a part of this modernization.

This is the same sense that I got from 2017's ""Youth"", a film about a troupe of Chinese dancers from the Cultural Revolution. The film looks back nostalgically at that era as one where everyone was poor so there was no greed, but people lived close together in a common troupe. It portrays post-reform China as one where people are greedy and war heroes are treated like dirt.

In late years it seems a similar question is being asked on both sides of the ""Lake"". (I call the Pacific a ""Lake"" as it is slightly bigger than the Atlantic which is called the ""Pond"".) While Western populations decry the excesses of neoliberalism and manifests itself in populist politics, people in China do the same and manifests itself in everything from a neo-Maoism that is ecstatic about Trump's trade war (as it weakens pro-market, pro-Western factions in China) to a generalized nostalgia for the past, which ripples into immigrant communities is felt in *The Farewell*.",ckwhml

Third was billi making noise to her flock her in China and it being heard. Connected. Free. Release.

The scene before was her family discussing if America or China is better and though they tried to make it simplistic, the realities of both kept coming up. 

And then right after, it shows her family walking past the room and nearly all of them look in then quickly turn their heads away and keep walking. But Awkwafina looks and really processes a room of gamblers and prostitutes. She sees the prostitute looking like she wished she could be anywhere else. 

So I think she was just looking at another aspect of China that others would turn away from. 

But I’m always of the opinion that people might read into movies a little too much. Sometimes it’s more about the feeling you got from the imagery more than a real reason.",ckwhml

Most indie movies don't really have a production budget, they tend to use tight shots and editing to make up for a lack of compelling sets.

I would argue that she was perfectly casted. The establishing scenes of Billi show that she's flawed, and very much mixed herself in another culture, unlike the rest of her family. Some of this is established in dialog before she goes to China, and others established when she's there. 

As for casting, I looked up her mother, father, nai nai. It's almost too good. These actors are seasoned. Been doing it for a while in their country. Everyone could carry the weight when it needs to be. It seems this script requires this. If every actor was signed on to match the other, you might as well have a QT film on your hands.

This exam is notoriously tough and causes a lot of mental health issues due to the sheer amount of time spent preparing for it and its high level of difficulty. So, if parents can afford to send their kids overseas for college, they'd rather do that then have them go through the examination process. This is especially true if the parents know that their kids aren't suited for test-taking. 

No joke, I once met a Chinese mother who was already saving the money to send her kids to America even though they were both still in Elementary School (1 was 9 the other was 4 I believe).

I think she's likely going to end up in my top 15 of the year, which is very very good (I expect to see about 115 films from the year). But when we say ""I don't think she deserves a nomination for this"" a lot of well meaning people read that as ""she was bad in the movie"" and they get upset and downvote. Even on an awards-oriented podcast I hear this line of thinking. In discussing the Emmy's, one guy said that he doesn't think Kit Harrington deserved a nomination for this season as Jon Snow and the host said ""oh interesting, you thought he was bad this year?"" and the guy had to awkwardly say that Kit was good, but not one of the X best actors of the year.

fciqctm,"Yes and no.

Billi is effectively our eyes and she cant comprehend certain things. There is exposition but I was happy with the uncle being the main culprit as it fitted his character. His speech regarding them taking on the burdens of her illness was great IMO. 

I did feel her mom was more obvious with it and the sole point of her character though.

So overall it is a bit heavy handed but some people don't see the subtleties as easily and the film needs to be accessible for neutrals. 

It's not just being shown in West but also in the East, as much as we're learning about Chinese culture, Chinese film goers will also want to see another point of view.

The scene where they're talking about little Baos future is a good example of that. Chinese families are very money orientated, for their children to be more successful, its alien in that regard to consider any other path as a lot of families, come from very little.",ckwhml

So her only outlet is the piano, upon which she hammered out a dramatic, sad-sounding piece.

And the only one who turned to watch was Nai Nai.  Everyone else appeared to not notice, which they surely had to consciously make an effort to do — Billi is playing LOUD.

I’ve also read a review that said this was, in a way, a classic heist movie — but instead of stealing money or jewels, the family steals the truth, and the reward is Nai Nai’s happiness.  So, then, when Billi runs from the family portrait to grab the test results from the nanny, it’s like she finally says, “I’m in”, and it’s the key moment of cracking the bank vault or grabbing the necklace.  Then when they all walk back home, it’s the gang on the way to the exit (Nai Nai), and we hope they can get away with the jewels (the falsified test results).

This is just not always true.  Just because she continued to speak Mandarin with her grandparents does not been she would stay fluent. I know a bunch of kids who are ABC or moved to America from China/HK/Taiwan at a young age who suck at speaking Chinese now.  Many of those kids had parents who when they moved, only spoke English to their kids and very little Chinese so that their kids could learn English quicker/better, thus they lose their fluency.

In other cases with those kids, if you're only speaking Chinese to your grandparent/parents and no one else, you're not really going to stay fluent, especially with a language like Chinese.  They're in a country where they hear/speak English most of the time and very little Chinese.  Yeah, maybe Billi calls her grandparents once or twice week, but that is still not enough to retain fluency because she doesn't hear it or speak it enough.  Hell, I know some kids who only spoke Chinese with they grandparents who lived with them since their grandparents didn't know any English and apparently they still suck at speaking Chinese. 

When I went to this movie with my friends, they said the most accurate part of the movie is that Billi sucks at speaking Chinese and my friends were laughing at themselves since now they know what they sound like when they speak Chinese because it's all broken and with an American accent like Billi.",ckwhml

And then I wondered if the music was just for us in the audience.  But as the camera came around, we saw that Nai Nai was listening intently.  As far as we know, she might not have seen Billi play at all, especially not at the skill level she’s playing here — Billi (Lulu) left China before first grade.

I’d suggested in another comment that Nai Nai might know that she’s sick.  She may not know the exact diagnosis; but she hid her husband’s illness from him, too, so she knows the routine.  So I think she’s watching as if she knows she’ll never get to see Billi play again.",ckwhml

In the U.K. we get Chinese students obviously but disproportionately to the top universities so I had assumed it wasn’t about Western education  generally but specific institutions such as Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford that carried the cultural cache just as they do in other countries. 

The other aspect I had considered, as seen with the Doctor in the film, that an education in America or Britain is also a good education in English which would help.

Thanks for the reply!",ckwhml

evx1fyd,"Nai nai is a regional term for father's mother, not all regions use that term.

In certain regions the father's mother is referred to as nai nai ""奶奶"", in other places ""姥姥"", ""阿媽"", ""祖母"".  The term that is used is dependent on the regional dialect.",ckwhml
ewniz66,"No. If it was purely fictional but based on Wang's experience, or the grandmother had already died or was told of her illness, that's different. But at the end of the day Nai Nai is not my grandmother and I trust her family knows what's best.",ckwhml

She’s done it before, everyone around her either looks like they want to cry or is actually crying, etc. it seems like she knows something is going on and is putting on a brave face for everyone else, perpetuating the whole “I’m fine” lie.",ckwhml

I just thought those were touches by Lulu to hint that way.",ckwhml

evt96ur,"Yeah, it still helps, but would have been better had he been all Asian.  It's still lightyears beyond having a white guy play it as an Asian, which is how they'd have done it 60 years ago.  So we're halfway there!  Maybe in another 60 years....

The character wasn't mixed race, though.  Mixed race representation is a separate issue, and I'd love to see films take that on.",ckwhml
evt4eok,"First of all, that's not what I said.  I'm talking about systemic racism which has been prevalent since films first began.  All three of those actors have dealt with it and are largely typecast into martial arts roles, not ""sexy get the girl"" roles.  I know Bruce Lee had also talked about how he was denied roles to play Asian characters in films that ended up giving those roles to white guys.

Asian men should be allowed to be masculine without having to be a kung fu stereotype.  And don't get me started on what Tarantino's latest film did to Bruce Lee.",ckwhml

It's a reality that's often overlooked, but to be fair, I'd say the plight of half-white people is far lower on the list of priorities than many underrepresented groups such as non-white Latinos, Native Americans, Arabs and Asians.   And it's particularly problematic when Hollywood relies on the half-white part of an actor to sanitize the ethnic side for mass consumption.",ckwhml

ewqenz3,"Yeah but we see Billi regularly having phone conversations with her grandmother in Mandarin so clearly she’s been keeping up with the language throughout her life. The real “Billi,” Lulu Wang, speaks perfect Mandarin and has even said they adjusted Billi’s dialogue to match Awkwafina’s lower proficiency. So I mean, what you said isn’t incorrect, but in this case Awkwafina’s Mandarin just kind of sucks lol and I don’t think it was a character choice (beyond not knowing the translation for certain words, which is very understandable). Even without regular practice, a character who supposedly lived in China until they were 6 should not be mispronouncing the word “hat” lol 

And like I mentioned, pronunciation and intonation is huge in Chinese. Since you’re not familiar with the language, I don’t expect you to get it, but I’m also not the only Chinese speaker in this thread who found Awkwafina’s accent distracting from her character.",ckwhml

evx1khc,"Yeah I guess Nainai is just the standard mandarin.  It seems kind of pointless though to point out that different regional dialects have different words, since probably 90% of all Chinese words have different pronunciations or usages in different local dialects.

As you were posting that, I found this Q&A session where an audience member asked about the film’s music.  She said that she wanted a classical score, maybe with some public domain music, but Alex Weston told her that he’d rather compose something new.  It starts at 27:00 -ish.

evxbosq,"A lot of regions actually do not use 奶奶.  The regional dialects of Chinese are diverse enough that a person growing up with one might not know the vocabulary of another.  I did not use the term 奶奶 growing up, and thought it sounded weird the first time I heard it (had always used 阿媽).

Plus she just said she would visit Haiyan and Jian in America with her husband. What's more, she brought up her husband in the conversation, which is not the behavior of someone trying to hide something. 



In any case it's just a very abnormal thing to happen in China, you don't hide the passing of the older generation from the younger one, since it's expected, and the younger generation is expected to be able to deal with it (and so they can honor the dead with a funeral and visits, in accordance with tradition) - other situations in the movie, however ridiculous, are not atypical of Chinese society, indeed that's the whole point of the movie. To introduce something atypical like that is abrupt and doesn't really fit.",ckwhml

I remember thinking it was odd that she was all “yeah everything will be fine and I’m going to be doing great “ and being all smiley but then turn away with a more dark and sad face almost immediately.

I’ll concede that maybe the husband isn’t dead but maybe the reality isn’t as rosy as she painted it in that conversation to allay any fears and worry the other character had.,ckwhml
