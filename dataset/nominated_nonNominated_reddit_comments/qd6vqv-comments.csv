hhkwekh,The bagpipes. THE BAGPIPES,qd6vqv
hhmwtz0,"Anyone else feel like the importance of water was a miss? I was especially disappointed that they cut Paul crying after killing Janis. I always felt that his giving of his bodies water at the death of Janis and honoring him in that way, in the eyes of the Fremen, was a significant contributor to their initial acceptance of him. 

I had a giant ass grin on my face when Kyne brought out the hooks. I wish I had a recording of my face going from ecstatic to horrified when she died; what a great tease. 

I was really disappointed the dinner scene didn't make it in but also understand how hard a scene like that would be to convert to film. 

Ultimately I thought it was an incredible adaptation of a book that I always thought would be impossible to convert to visual media correctly. The visuals were stunning. Especially the space-faring vessels. Fucking awesome.",qd6vqv

hhl7u6q,"I just watched it on IMAX. I was bummed out not because the film was bad, but because I didn’t want the film to end and it did. I became deeply invested and I left the theater wanting the story to continue. Let’s hope Part II gets made.",qd6vqv

hhlytqh,"I was surprised and impressed how much they committed to different houses/cultures speaking in entirely different languages that needed subtitles, when they easily *could* have just had them speak to each other openly (Sardaukar, Harkonnens, etc).  Way more subtitles than they really “had to” use.  But it really emphasized how entirely distinct some of these groups are from each other.",qd6vqv
hhnhae1,I really enjoyed Leto and Paul's interactions. It was refreshing to see a loving father and son relationship under the pressure of royalty. Leto was understanding of Paul's trepidation.,qd6vqv

hhoa8ig,The jump cuts from dark room to blinding light seared my retinas more than a handful of times.,qd6vqv
hhmgnvn,"It's a relatively small moment in the overall film, but the scene that really sold the whole thing for me was the pre-departure ritual of the Sardaukar. The entire thing was just so damn alien. The long necked figure leading the ceremony from atop the tower, the rows of grizzled warriors being smeared with blood, the sacrificed men upside down on their altars and the haunting throat-singing that ties the whole scene together.

It just felt like I was there looking at another world that was completely alien to anything I've ever seen. I don't think I've felt anything like that since the 'march to the altar' scene in Apocalypto. I loved the rest of the movie, but I can't stop thinking about that one scene...",qd6vqv

Well, I now have a new thing to tell my son when I drop him off at school.",qd6vqv
hhkpdd4,"The Baron floating was fucking horrifying, it is not at all how I pictured it in the book. I loved the little moment where he bumped his foot across the table as he was lowering down towards the duke, it was such a nice little touch.

I am just so thrilled at having finally seen that, I read it for the first time with a dune book fanclub with the original trailer release and then the delay happened and it just feels magical to finally see it especially with so many actors that I love as well as my favorite director, such a great adaptation for me. Also that soundtrack with the chanting and just the bagpipes was amazing.",qd6vqv

hhs7w7m,Anyone else think Javier Bardem in this looked like a super serum Aaron Rodgers?,qd6vqv
hhmvv5n,The entire scene on the planet of the emperor’s army was one of the most off-putting scenes I’ve ever watched. Not in a bad way at all. I love movies that can evoke weird feelings. And that planet is just one big weird feeling.,qd6vqv

hhkybcc,"I don't think I heard a single ""Muad'dib"" the entire movie. Thought for sure they'd at least say it in the end.

hhqngj6,The most visually impressive movie I’ve seen since Mad Max Fury Road. The scale of everything was just mammoth. The detail of everything was so acute. The wardrobe and costume design was killer. 2.5 hours was not long enough for me. Praying for an extended cut.,qd6vqv

hhkxk01,"I’ve always thought Mamoa was a decent but not great actor (though that could also be affected by the roles and scripts he chooses) but I thought he was fantastic in this.  He was very similar to his usual role but something about him in this just really clicked for me.  I honestly would watch a whole movie or mini-series about his backstory, guy was just effortlessly badass.",qd6vqv

hhkjnrw,"In an age when CGI can show us anything this movie caught my eye not with spectacle but its complete commitment to creating an alien human culture. Set design, costuming, and ship design felt more important than they ever have before.

hhwibbh,"One subtle thing I picked up:  Paul had a vision in the beginning, where Duncan Idaho was dead. In that vision, there was a black bug that appeared for three seconds. I knew that was intentional. Later on, right before Duncan was preparing for battle, he held the black bug on the ground, confirming the vision and confirming that it would be his ""final"" battle. Cool little detail.",qd6vqv

hhkowdj,"Some thoughts and questions as a non-reader:

* The hunter-seeker / little mosquito assassin robot after Paul: Does it not have sight? It went all the way up to Paul's eyeball and darted after the housemaid when she opened the door. Also who sent that assassin in? Was he left there by House Harkonnen?
*  The use of swords: My theory as a non-reader is that, since the development of the shields, ordinary bullets have become useless. Therefore, soldiers had to revert back to swords and melee weapons that can penetrate the shields. And then there are the expensive shield-drilling bullets that we saw. Is this correct?
* Regarding the shields and fighting style: I noticed that the fighting style was quite slow and dance-like. Was it purposefully done this way as to show that slow, powerful and fluid movements can penetrate the shield that blocks anything that is high velocity?
* My favorite ""prophecy"" by far was the one Paul had about his eventual duelist. I loved how in his dream they were portrayed as close friends, the duelist almost like an endearing father figure wanting to teach him the ways of the desert. But in reality he introduced Paul to the ways of the desert in a brutal fight to the death.",qd6vqv

hhko0qp,My favorite part is the closed captioning on HBO Max telling me the *DRAMATIC (ANCIENT) LAMENTATION MUSIC* is back!,qd6vqv
hhu0d03,did it annoy anyone that the computer that was telling Paul about  Arrakis first says the sand worms can grow up to 400 METERS and very shortly after says something about how deep something is in FEET (I think maybe the roots of a tree the Fremen plant in the desert)?....no? ok,qd6vqv
hhmunm5,"Welp. I need more, right now. Book ordered.",qd6vqv
hhrq9cu,"I liked how when Leto asked Jessica ""will you protect Paul"" she replied ""with my life""; but when he said ""no, I mean the Bene Gesserit,"" she was all ""why are you thinking these thoughts?""

hhkp6fa,"As a big fan of the books I absolutely loved this. Followed the book pretty extraordinarily well, obviously needing to cut out a lot of the exposition about mentats and all that and the histories, etc. But the meat was still there and amazing.

 Honestly, it did feel a bit rushed in spots but that's coming from someone who's read the book multiple times and knows what had to be cut. I completely understand the decisions and why they stuff had to be cut and it doesn't take away from the film even if you know the books. The only way it would be better is if it was a 10 episode HBO series with the same production value. 

The visuals were absolutely stunning as well as the scale of everything. I think my favorite visual element was actually the 'thopters. They looked so much better than I could've ever imagined.

Episode 2 comes out next week, right?

Right?",qd6vqv
hhnmjvq,"While I liked the movie, one thing I found interesting compared to previous adaptations is that this movie refused to really explain completely what was going on. The amount of exposition in comparison to other adaptations felt shockingly low.",qd6vqv
hho941q,Duncan closing the door and yelling at the sarkaudars gave me chills,qd6vqv
hhydy5c,Don't have much to say other than holy fuck was Oscar Isaac a fucking snack in this movie. Legitimately may be the most attractive character I've ever seen in a Hollywood film apart from Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.,qd6vqv
hhsu85l,Had a revelation during the scene where Paul and Jessica are doing the sand walk. One of the main lines in the song 'Weapon of Choice' by Fatboy Slim is 'Walk without rhythm and it won't attract the worm'. That has to be a fucking Dune reference and I'm beating myself up for not recognizing it sooner. XD,qd6vqv
hhms6ef,Skarsgard channeled Brando from Apocalypse Now so point on.  It was uncanny.  Wish he had more screen time.,qd6vqv
hhljkxx,"I came into this move completely blind, only knowing that the book, Dune, had something called spice in it that was a drug or something. And I gotta say, pretty fantastic movie. I wasn't bored at all, I didn't get lost or get questions that weren't answered (I do have ones that I'm sure will be answered in later films though). And after putting off the books for so long because I heard they were quite daunting, I've started listening to the audio book (which so far is an absolute treat, with a full cast of characters) simply because the world seems really interesting and I want to get sucked in to it.

The cast did a fantastic job, the music was incredible, the visuals were stunning, and I sincerely hope there's a sequel. I'm actually contemplating going to see it again on iMax. And the last movie I saw in theatres was 'Into the Spiderverse'. So it's been a while since a movie has made me want to experience it on the big screen, but Dune definitely makes me want to. (And anything to help sway them to do a sequel, including a $15 movie ticket)",qd6vqv

hhnwpxv,"Pump more Dune straight into my veins. I need another movie, please.",qd6vqv
hhmpleq,Who played Baron Harkonnen? Someone give that man a medal. I've never experiened such discomfort in a cinema before watching that monstrosity floating around the screen. Creepy as fuck. My wife felt very unsettled by it hours after the movie.,qd6vqv
hhtacz4,"Okay, I just came back from this and am so conflicted. On one hand, I'm 100% in. It's beautiful, cinematic and wonderful. On the second hand, I feel like I was handed  half a story. Which is so bizarre because I could have sworn that some of the trailers showed something very different.

I actually went back and looked. The first trailer and the expanded sequence with the pain box was much more compelling than what was actually shown.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xhJrPXop4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xhJrPXop4)

As someone who isn't familiar with the source material I don't understand why they didn't focus more on the aspects of betrayal and Paul's ascension. The tone by the end doesn't feel transcendent as Paul steps into the headship of house of atreides. Instead it feels like he is still in survival mode. I don't think he speaks directly about his perspective regarding the throne after that scene with Oscar Isaac's where he asks 'what if I'm not ready'.

I think giving us a little more about why the pain box is necessary, having Paul be more confident in carrying on his family's legacy and honestly just expressing more willingness to do so would've gone a long way imo.

Idk why this stuff was cut - I feel like the film moved pretty okay. I don't think I would've minded another 15 min to fill in some of the character arc for Paul.",qd6vqv

hhkm0k1,"Read the (original Frank Herbert) books a few years back and this was as perfect as you can make it without drowning in the details of the Great Houses, Landsraad, CHOAM, Butlerian Jihad.  

I loved how Thufir ""calculated"" (Mentats are human computers) and the opening attack of the Fremen was just as it was described in the book. You saw how dangerous lasers were (""lasguns"" in the books) and they kept sub-communication (the hand gestures as language). They made the 'thopters sound like helicopters and the anguish on Jessica's face when Paul faced ""The Box"" was incredible.  

Hans Zimmer's score in certain scenes (eg. Reverend Mother's ship arriving) was superb. They got the heart and soul of the story correct. Making the Sardaukar into zealots was an interesting move (in the books they are prisoners who have survived very cruel conditions). Some of the ship designs came straight from the book covers.

hhkkydq,So I don't know if anyone else had this issue at their theater but I saw this in IMAX with my girlfriend and holy shit this was the loudest movie I've ever seen. It got to the point where it was slightly ruining the experience because I could barely hear the dialogue with the music/sfx turned all the way up to the max and I was just waiting for scenes to end so my ears could have a break. Other than that this is was really enjoyable.,qd6vqv
hhrndcu,"I would have been happy if the movie was 2:35:00 and it took that amount of time to get to the coup. I feel like we didn’t have enough time with Isaac and Brolin to make their death/possible death meaningful.

hhuo6l9,"I wanted to spend more time with this movie. Not just watch it again, but watch more of it. It was so complete in its world design and sound design and cinematography that it should be a masterpiece, but I found myself wanting more character moments. More connective tissue. There were times where everyone except really Paul, Jessica, and Duncan felt more like cameo appearances than a supporting cast.

It needed more. More of the Atreides establishing themselves on Arrakis (the hidden garden in the palace, the dinner scene with Stilgar). Seriously another half hour with the baron and his ilk. Giving David Dastmalchian anything more to do would’ve been helpful. Some beats for Yueh so he’s not just dropping his reveal out of the blue and then explaining it.

The cast was good enough to carry this movie, but they’re good enough to deserve more moments to really solidify their characters",qd6vqv

“The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience – a process that cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move with the flow of the process.”

When Jamis said this it felt like it was directed specifically at me and i got really emotional. Also the line

hhkineq,"Denis delivers again. 

Such a gorgeous movie. Saw this in IMAX and it was **stunning**. The set design and lighting were phenomenal, and this succeeded in giving the scale needed that many sci-fi movies falter at.

This Dune seems to have focused mostly on the heart/story while all the 'lore' is on the backburner. Not much at all shown or discussed about the guilds, about the Bennies, about the Harkonnen, why Spice is even so important seems to be glossed over. And I can see why this would irritate many Dune fans. But it's an adaptation, not a direct translation. And this absolutely felt like a well made Dune movie that is broadly palatable for the general populace rather than all the nitty gritty for purists.

As far as the 'abrupt' ending many are talking about. That's about as good a spot they could possibly end at for part one. It ends with the ""death"" of Paul and ""birth"" of him as the Kwisatz Haderach.

*Overall* though, personally, I'm pleased with this adaptation. Would give this an 8.5/10. My IMAX theater was at least 3/4 full, so hopefully that bodes well for the box office. It will be a crime to not get a sequel to this.",qd6vqv

Dune was (in a wonderfully ironic manner) a tall glass of water in this dry cinematic climate. So refreshing to have slow intrigue so well done. 

This film has my support (wish I could see in theaters, but will definitely grab the 4k!)",qd6vqv
hhn1vz8,"I haven't read the books and I'm in two minds. Everything up until the Harkonnens invaded Arrakis was great. It had some of the best worldbuilding of any movie I've seen. It took its time and focused on a lot of little things, like a spice refinery being lifted away and Paul's conversation with the gardener about the palm trees. I liked the introduction to each of the planets. I enjoyed the slow pace and I was into all the characters. I think Gurney was my favourite.

Everything after the battle, with Paul having visions and a whole lot of him and Jessica wandering around in the desert, I was zoning out. I found the politics between the Houses the most interesting part of the movie. The idea of uprooting your whole life and having to make a new one on a complete hellhole, with Harkonnen sabotage to deal with, was interesting. Once all that was gone, I was less interested. That was also the moment where I wish they'd picked up the pace a bit more (or given some of that time to the more interesting first half. People say important stuff is missing). The Harkonnen scenes were the only ones I was invested in for the second half of the film. Especially the scene with the Baron eating dinner, while the Duke was naked opposite him. That was disturbing.",qd6vqv

hhun98r,"Sci-fi fans, fans of cinematography and people with a wide imagination will love this film unconditionally. People who value deep dialogue and characterisation might not love it so much. 

I belong to the former camp but I do understand some of the criticism from the latter. I don't agree with many dialoguees about the characters all being completely dull and unrelatable though. Many of them are quite one-dimensional (e.g. the Baron, although he is still fascinating in my opinion despite his character being quite straightforward) but personally I felt the intense conflict within Jessica and the feeling of betrayal and frustration within Paul. 

The visuals and sound carry this film for me. 11/10 for those categories. The story and the characters are good, nothing spectacular. 7.5/10 for each. Overall a healthy 9/10 movie.",qd6vqv

hhmu33f,"Saw it last night in IMAX, long-time book lover, I even appreciate the bizarre kitsch of the Lynch version and the campy Syfy miniseries. My quick thoughts:

* As expected, the visuals and sound are absolutely stunning. Denis captured scale in an even more profound way than he did on BR2049. And the Zimmer soundtrack is alien yet familiar, it thumps you thoracic cavity like a drum during tense moments. Go see this on the biggest screen with the best sound system you are comfortable with.
* I had some initial doubts on Chalamet but he did really well portraying the brooding and skilled yet also whiny and angsty teenager that Paul Atreides is. It will be interesting to see how he adjusts his portrayal post-time skip and post-water of life in Part 2.
* Though she wasn't featured much in the trailers, Rebecca Ferguson was the highlight for me. She was a really good Jessica, and the dynamic between her and Chalamet especially in the stil-tent was fantastic. The other highlight was Javier Bardem. His Stilgar was fantastic. I wish we had gotten more of him but I understand why.
* The rest of the cast is good, it will be interesting to see how much chemistry Chalamet and Zendaya have in part 2. A lot will depend on it.
* The way Denis is portraying Paul's emerging prescience is interesting. I'm not sure I fully buy into it yet, but man that is a tough concept to try and convey in film.
* The Harkonnens were suitably gross and the Sardaukar were suitably terrifying. I do wish the Sardaukar had been depicted a little more impressive though. Duncan has his badass moment but it sort of cheapens they effectiveness of the Sardaukar.
* Every scene with the worms is just jaw-dropping. It really helps to subtly convey how and why they are so revered by the Fremen even before you learn about the spice cycle.
* Denis did a really good job of avoiding boring exposition and letting it come organically as much as possible, but it definitely makes for a higher barrier of entry for casual watchers. I do wish there had been something about Suk conditioning to explain why Yueh's betrayal was so unexpected. And at least a brief explanation of Hawat and Piter's abilities and roles. Bonus points for sapho stains though.

In the end, 9/10 for me. Extremely accurate to the book. The sense of scale and visuals are top-notch. Casting was great all around. If we don't get a part 2 I will fight you Warner Bros.",qd6vqv
hhmtyt8,"This movie was really fuckin good and one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. 

Usually I get bored of 2.5 hour movies but this kept my interest pretty much the whole time and from the attack on arrakis to the end felt like 30 minutes. 

The ending was definitely left on a disappointing cliffhanger but there's no way with that ending they aren't making a second one.",qd6vqv

Things I liked:

\-The voice is awesome  
\-I loved all the references to Old Duke and the bull  
\-I liked the hand signals and secret languages  
\-cone of silence!  
\-the mentat's eyes rolling back for calculations  
\-Gurney reading the OC bible as they land on Arrakis  
\-Paul grappling with the spice  
\-The score had me so hyped  
\-all the little Muad'dibs running around! 

\-The fremen don't automatically worship Paul (Lynch mistake)

​

Things I disliked:

\-Once they get to Arrakis everything moves a bit too fast  
\-On that note, it takes away from the Arrakeen people  
\-Like others have said, I wish there was more emphasis on water as wealth    
\-They barely had any Yueh, Thufir or Piter  (and obviously no Feyd at all)  
\-They don't explain or even say mentat at all  
\-On that note, they don't explain why there are no computing machines  
\-They don't emphasize the mechanics of the shield clearly enough for casual moviegoers  
\-On that note, they don't emphasize why lasers can't be used against shields which explains why everyone uses swords/knives

Overall I really enjoyed my moviegoing experience (shelled out for AMC Dolby screen) and am seeing it at a true IMAX screen on Wednesday.  Excited for part II whenever that arrives.  I hope it opens with Feyd in the arena.",qd6vqv

The cinematography and production design and score perfectly captured the sterile, alien vibe

The scene with the gathering of the Sardaukar, where the guy is giving directions (or whatever the hell he was doing?) in this weird tinny, robotic voice was chilling because I couldn't compare it to anything else I've ever seen in a movie",qd6vqv

I'm not a big sci-fi fan, no exposure to the source material, nothing against any of the lead actors but a good number of them have been in other stuff I've seen that I didn't think they were particularly good in, etc.

But holy shit was I wrong. I really loved this movie. I like Villeneuve a lot, so it had that at least going for it going into it but everything else was fantastic too. The film is visually stunning, I thought the acting was great, the dialogue felt like in less capable hands it could come off as melodramatic and corny in places but the actors all made it work really well to avoid that. Can't wait for the next one. I watched on HBO Max but afterwards I bought a ticket for it in theaters, I won't go see it but I wanted the movie to have my money so the powers that be know it's a franchise worth really investing in.",qd6vqv
hhn4skk,Man. Never read Dune. That movie was Rad as hell.,qd6vqv
hhy1nlh,"I've read the books so I know what's up, but I think the movie didn't explain a few important key concepts well enough for non-book fans. 

1. Why spice is a big deal. There's an exposition in the beginning and that's it. Although tbf book didn't quite explain it that much in the first half either. 
2. How dry Arrakis really is. In the book you can see very early how everything on Arrakis revolves around water because it's such a rare and valuable thing on the planet. In the movie it just feel like some regular desert town. 
3. How ferocious Fremens are. In the book they kill Sadaukas with ease but in the movie the only time we see them fight, a supposedly ""very good fight"" got toyed by Paul, a teenage boy. Hard to imagine why casual fans will supposed to take Fremens seriously after that. 

For me these are three key components in Dune's world building that were not really properly explained in the movie. Still a great movie, but I can imagine many people are not getting how unique the world building really is.",qd6vqv

>!Kynes' death being a badass ""I'm taking you with me"" thing wasn't as impactful as their tragic and lonely death in the book!<

\-About half the book is told through Jessica's perspective so she felt a little off in the movie.

1. This movie was mostly made for fans who have read the books or are at the very least folks familiar with the source material.
2. Too much of the movie felt like it was just there to set up a much larger movie. It should not take until well past the halfway mark of the story to get to the inciting incident to get the plot moving.

It was kinda horrifying how they found the Baron just clutched in that corner. Did not like his pet either I think I actually cringed from disgust. I love the scene with Paul and the Truthsayer. And holy shit the Saudaukar are being blessed with the blood of their slain enemies as it pools into a huge trough. Had some issues with the pacing in the middle and dialogue.

That being said, I felt the pacing was off. I'm worried about how this will perform overall. If we get a Part 2 I'm confident it will be great (judging from what we just saw) and Part 1 will appear much better in retrospect. But as a standalone I think it struggles.

I'm worried about how the average viewer is going to take this movie, having never read the book or seen the original. I fear that they will leave the theatres feeling it had a really weak Act 3 and just write it off. Go home and comment ""Looked beautiful but could use more story"" online.

hhm8ls3,"So I watched the movie last night and went in knowing nothing. I'd say it was just good. I really like the visuals, and it definitely had that Denis Villeneuve vibe (the ships reminded me of Arrival in some ways). It also had an interesting genre feel, like Star Wars plus Game of Thrones (I guess Oscar Isaacs didn't help with the Star Wars comparison), but I guess that goes to show that the book was likely very influential.

Some problems I had was that it was clearly a lot of setup being a part 1, and because of that it almost felt like not that much of consequence happened (even if it did). I also hate to say it but during the last hour the movie I found myself a little bit bored. It a combination of the lack of dialogue and then action scenes where it was kind of hard to see what was going on at points.

I'm definitely interested in the world that's set up. The spice is a cool notion. The sandworm is cool as fuck. I wanna know more about the voice. So there are definitely some stuff there, but I guess it's hard to give a complete review when only half the story is there.",qd6vqv

--- 
 
I'm going to echo what a lot of people are agreeing upon, which is that for all of its splendour, it *is* unfortunate that the momentum the film generated began tapering off towards the end of the 2hr 45m runtime. But, on the other hand, it's arguably commendable that they went in this direction, because to do otherwise, you would have had to seriously fuck with the plot. There is absolutely no other appropriate place in the book that you could have split the two movies and not have the second one be 5 hours long. Treating the source material with that kind of reverence, all for the sake of what was then an unconfirmed sequel, is only ever a good thing.

Other than that, from a visual standpoint, what a fucking adaption. Casting? Perfect. The Fremen? Phenomenal. The Reverend Mother/Gom Jabbar? Stunning. Ornithopters? Incredible. The sand worms? Staggering. The set design, the scale of the Guild Heighliners, Stellan Skarsgård's Baron Harkonnen, the factional clothing styles, the Sardaukar's gutteral language, the technology, EVERYTHING - perfect, perfect, ***perfect.***

Story wise, it's incredible that it was adapted as well as it was, given the fact that a *huge* amount of very important exposition in the book is given as either quotes from the Orange Catholic Bible or >!*Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib*!< at the start of chapters, or through >!Jessica's internal monologue as she fights through the is-she-or-isn't-she-a-traitor arc around the time of her banquet!<. And that's to make no mention of how half the book is its own fucking appendix. You don't quite get the same understanding as to the sheer magnitude of the Bene Gesserit's power and involvement, but they did extremely well in conveying their agenda and modus operandi. Oh, and The Voice is *sick.* Overall, it stays shockingly true to the book and that is a fantastic thing. 
  
Something I personally think is being overlooked in the frenzy of it all is how well Caladan was depicted. For all its insignificance to the story, it's as if Denis Villeneuve scanned my brainwaves and pulled out an utterly perfect, 1:1 visual representation as to how its described in the book and pictured by readers. 

I cannot express how much I enjoyed this film. I am not a massive film buff. I barely ever go to the cinema, and whenever I have in the recent past, it's *usually* been something MCU or MCU-adjacent. Now, I don't know if I can ever stomach watching stuff like that frequently. For this movie to go so slowly, to stay so true to a legendary piece of fiction, and to not pollute the tone with undue Hollywood spectacle or constant stupid quips, took real balls. It felt like it was made without even the slightest concern for how well it would line corporate pockets. It felt like it treated the audience with respect, understanding that people with more than two braincells don't need rapid-fire jump-cuts, and can be trusted to look at a static or uncluttered frame for more than a few seconds and not magically lose all interest.  
 
Dennis Villeneuve has made this movie more than a match for Blade Runner 2049 in his own filmography, and I don't know if there's any higher praise I can give a film.

In the book, from what I remember, the Baron just kinda goes off into some corridor and hides there, but the shot of the Baron floating on the ceiling was so so good.

They mention 3 brigades or whatever in the movie but it would have been cool to really make it clear that the 50,000 Harkonnen troops or whatever were being supplemented by maybe 1,000 Sardaukar and the Sardaukar were the decisive factor and probably could have beaten the Harkonnens themselves if they decided to kill both sides.

That makes it so much more shocking later when it turns out the Fremen are just as good if not better",qd6vqv

My only complaint is they didn't go enough certain characters quite enough. The Bene Gesserit got a lot of screentime, as they should, but Mentats and and Suk School literally weren't even mentioned. Reading the book ahead of time felt almost necessary to really understand what was happening, which is a shame because I really wanted my friends to get more enjoyment out of this movie (they haven't read it).

Still, pretty amazing adaptation that did (mostly) all it could. 9/10 can't wait for part 2 (and hopefully an eventual extended edition).",qd6vqv
hhzostg,"I haven’t read the books but I found this on Wikipedia which I don’t think spoils anything narrative-wise beyond what happens in the movie but it explains why the spice is so sought after (apologies if missed this in the movie): 

> The Dune saga is set thousands of years in humanity's future. Faster-than-light travel has been developed, and humans have colonized a vast number of worlds, but a great reaction against technology has resulted in a ban on any kind of “thinking machine”, with the creation or possession of such punishable by immediate death. Despite this prohibition, humanity continues to develop and advance other branches of technology, including ESP and instruments of war. At the time of the first book's setting, humanity has formed a feudal interstellar empire known as the Imperium, run by several Great Houses that oversee various planets. Of key interest is the planet Arrakis, known as ""Dune"". Entirely a desert planet with nearly no precipitation, it is the only planet where a special life-extending drug, melange or ""the spice"", can be found. In addition to life-extension, melange enhances the mental capacity of humans: it enables humans known as Mentats to perform complex calculations without the aid of computers, allows for the mutated Spacing Guild pilots to navigate folded space and travel the distances between planets, and creates the visions and powers of the Bene Gesserit, a religious group that secretly seeks to control the direction humanity takes. Melange is difficult to acquire not only due to the harsh environment of Arrakis, but also the presence of giant sandworms that are drawn towards any movement on the sands of the planet. Control of Arrakis, its spice production, and the impact on humanity's development become the centerpoints of a thousand-years long conflict that develops through the series.

I’m 99% sure the movie didn’t talk about computers being outlawed in the Dune universe and that the “spice” allows some humans to basically access computer-like mathematical capabilities (e.g. like the the guy whose eyeballs flip up, so you just see the whites of his eyes before his irises flip back to normal and he provides a calculation of something I can’t remember). It did say spice was important to interstellar travel but not why (that I remember). A cool detail which I think further emphasizes HOW the spice is so important.

It’s also pretty cool to realize other franchises that have borrowed ideas like this (e.g. AI is outlawed in the Mass Effect universe due to an AI nearly annihilating its creators)",qd6vqv

hihdcvd,"(Me, a white guy, about to step gingerly into the minefield of “representation”…)  
  
I listen to a lot of podcasts. Today, I listened to the Filmcast about “Dune,” where the panel discussed the Arrakis-native Fremen, whose fictional culture and background have Islamic overtones, as originally created by Frank Herbert. The Fremen are radicalized fierce warriors oppressed by outsiders. Although the Fremen are cast for max diversity, they talked about how it is potentially problematic for this culture to have few or no obviously Middle-Eastern actors portraying this Islamic-coded society.   
  
BUT… I also listened to NPR ‘s Pop Culture Happy Hour discussing “Foundation.” In this series, the panel discussed the Anacreon culture, radicalized fierce warriors oppressed by outsiders (as their planet gets bombed by the Empire). Here, they debated how potentially problematic it is that the culture is coded as Islamic, portrayed overwhelmingly by Middle-Eastern-appearing actors.  
  
Not that attitudes towards representation should be represented as monolithic, and I recognize there are nuanced differences between these two shows. But it appears that creators will face a damned-if-we-do-damned-if-we-don’t situation in terms of casting. Interesting these two properties released at nearly the same time can have different attitudes towards a similar issue. Someone is ALWAYS going to be unhappy.",qd6vqv

hinznn0,"I thought it was great but one small nitpick I have is it was weird that Paul learned about the sand walking from some video. In the books nobody has a clue how Fremen manage to travel around in the desert avoiding worms.


I like that Paul just instinctively figured it out in the books because it contributes to the “he shall know our ways” storyline and also shows how the balance of power shifts from Jessica to Paul once they get into the desert. 


It’s a minor thing but I also just didn’t understand why they included it because it doesn’t seem like it contributes anything.",qd6vqv
hiytxpl,"Read the book over the summer and was really excited to see this. Big fan of my Canadian, Quebecois boy Denis Villeneuve and I knew he wouldn't let me down. 

He definitely didn't. 

Fucking loved it. From the visuals, to the score, to the pacing, to how he adapted the story, all great. You can tell he's a big fan of dune and I think he knocked it out of the park. There's lots of things you can fuck up in this, as the original material is famously hard to adapt, but the dude killed did it. I think he did an amazing job of explaining the world without it feeling like it was lecturing you and keeping the flow of the movie. Not everything was in there obviously, but the choices he made creatively I understood why. Movies are different than books, and this is pretty faithful to the book while still being a good movie.

Loved the art direction and just the bleakness of it all, though the small amounts of humour in it aren't the best. But at least they're few and far between. 

I think the cast is almost perfect. Dr Kynes being the biggest change, but handled well. Wish more time was given to Yueh and Gurney but I'm sure Gurney will get his time in the second part. LOVED Bardem as Stilgar and Rebecca Ferguson was so good as Lady Jessica. Think I love her. Chalamet is serviceable as Paul, for being the main character though I don't think he had to really 'act' a ton. 

Score's beautiful too. I feel like Hans Zimmer is a meme at this point, but he did a great job. 

As a book fan, it's a great adaptation and I really enjoyed myself throughout. Excited for the next one and bummed we're going to have to wait like TWO YEARS for it. 

So glad I waited to see this an IMAX. If you didn't see it that way, you missed out. Go see it!",qd6vqv
hizl06a,"So I saw the movie yesterday and dont get me wrong, its not a bad movie, it started spectacular and was engrossing and then it just wasnt anymore. Slow paced events, dreams and storytelling rendered it boring at the end IMO.

The worldbuilding felt artificial and void, layered with spectacular set pieces & Zimmer music to confuse viewers into thinking this is great worldbuilding. Some things I really felt they could have expanded on to bring the world to life were the anti-computer concepts and the Holtzman Shield's ability to let slow moving objects through so the user could interact with their surroundings.

The film felt empty, a lot of the nuanced complexities of character interactions & relationships were lost. The pathos of specific scenes from an emotional stand point were missing. The unrelenting mercilessness of the planet Arrakis, the tenuous relationship between Jessica and Paul as he awakens in his prescience, the careful cultivation of his status as a superhuman; (Male benegesserit reverend mother, mentat and guild navigator) all of this was absent. The film exposed the hidden & unexpected power of the Fremen through dialogue and exposition, this feature was slowly revealed in the book as well as their ability to tame & ride the great worms. Nothing in this movie was unexpected, nothing was slowly unravelled it was all presented matter of fact on the table.

I was also disappointed by Dr Yueh's treatment. In the book we get clear introspections into his mind, moreso than a lot of the other characters. Out of all the Atreides Supporting characters he was by far the most fleshed out, even beyond Thufir Hawat (who also didn't get great film treatment). His goals were clearly laid out and even him screwing over Leto and the whole house wasn't enough to make him a villain in my eyes. Even his DEATH was cool in the book. A real battle of the mind between him and the Baron. His disdain toward the Baron was PALPABLE in the book but in the movie he was just killed narrowly off screen and tossed aside.

I even found the fight scenes lacking in tension. The production design & production values were top notch but the film lacks heart, it doesn't rise above banality to become something extra ordinary. I definitely would have preferred to see Jorodowskys Dune because that film would have taken risks, it would have the mad, idiosyncrasies of its director. Villeneuves rendition played it safe, and safe translates to boring unfortunately.

Personally I think one of the biggest problems with the way that people review movies these days is they either say it's a masterpiece, or it's trash. It's all extremes in the positive or negative direction. There is no inbetween anymore, sometimes it is fine for a movie to be just OK. That's what I thought of this movie. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't garbage. Just ok, and that is just fine. It's only half of the book, and I'm sure the sequel will be better, and that is why I think a lot of Dune fans loved the movie. Dune fans / space opera fans who know the major narrative twist will be kept on their seats waiting for that glorious twist (to come in part 2). But as a blind viewer, the movie was long, boring, and anticlimactic.

Personally I am not the biggest fan of Villeneuve movies either. He has a way of dragging scenes out that I find irritating and that makes them feel 5x longer than they need to be. I wanted to give Dune a chance but now I'll probably never watch another one of his movies again.

TLDR: It was an okayish 2 hour plus movie that really felt like nothing happened, more like an extended trailer IMO.",qd6vqv
hjrys2x,"Finally had a chance to head down to the theater with the kids and watch this.  I'm a pretty big fan of the first novel (reread it a number of times), a mild fan of the second Dune novel, and to varying degrees I dislike/loathe the other Dune books I've read/attempted to read. 

Collection of random thoughts:

--A shockingly large amount of the Dune novel is devoted to world-building ... some would say it goes too far.  This world-building isn't just there to dress up the human drama, to a large extent it drives the human drama.  Without an understanding of the tension between Paul's desires and the Bene Gesserit's millennia-old plans for the Kwisatz Haderach, or how the infighting between the houses (especially in regards to the control of Spice) serves as a counter-balance to the Emperor's rule, you kind of miss out on the broader meaning of the events affecting the main characters.

And Denis Villenueve just nailed it.  NAILED IT.  In my mind, he's kind of done the impossible, which is render comprehensible in a fair running time the scope and breadth of the Dune narrative.  Now, I suppose there's a caveat here ... I am pretty familiar with the novel, so I might not be the best person to judge how coherent the story came across, but my son and daughter did seem to pick up on most of the important bits when I quizzed them.  My son actually said ""if those priest women were waiting for someone like Paul for hundreds of years, why were they so mean to him?  Won't that make him hate them?""  Very good questions!!!!

If there's any world-building missing, it's probably an explanation for the lack of computers/AI (which I kept waiting for but never saw).  Without that key bit of info the Mentats perhaps seem a bit confusing as to why they're needed.  I'm also pretty sure they never discussed why it was so startling that the doctor was able to betray them (in the novels they're subjected to a kind of hypnotic conditioning that is supposed to make betrayal impossible).  My son also asked why nobody was using guns, so ... yeah ... maybe a throwaway line regarding how shields work would have helped (literally one line; ""these shields make guns and laser blasters useless).  Still, they did an amazing job of weaving in the exposition without bringing the story to a grinding halt.

--It's an odd juxtaposition to finally see Dune brought to life in a competent fashion and then realize how it so clearly inspired later works.  I mean, you can't help but watch this and see shades of Star Wars EVERYWHERE, yet Dune came first. 

--The film looks glorious.  Just glorious.  Easily the best merger of FX and practical since Blade Runner 2049, and far and away the most inspired futuristic landscapes (of jaw-dropping detail and scope) since ... Blade Runner 2049.  Hmmmm ....

--This is an impeccably cast film.  Skaarsgaard is maybe more physically ominous than I imagined Baron Harkonnen, but the portrayal is perfect.  The doomed Duke Leto has Oscar Isaac adding a desperately needed human touch to the proceedings, and Rebecca Ferguson (who oddly enough is a Bene Gesserit yet has most of the ""heavy-lifting"" emotional scenes) is fantastic. Lady Jessica is a super tough role, she has to be a caring mother and loving partner to Duke Leto yet also be an imperious Space Witch; great job Ferguson.  Brolin is great, Bautista seems like he was bred for the role, and Zendaya captures the ""distant and mysterious"" tone the role calls for.  I'm not sold on Momoa, but we'll see if he can bring his portrayal of his clone to life (tee hee).  Chalamet is great, but more on that below ...

--Send every single clip of Chalamet in this to the folks making the Amazon Wheel of Time show.  Timothéé really impressed me with his ability to convey in not-very-much-dialogue the various facets of Paul Atreides, but almost moreso than Paul, he reminds me of Rand Al'Thor (this makes perfect sense if you believe, like I do, that that Al'Thor and the Aes Sedai represent a blatant, fantasy-setting rewrite of the Paul Atreides and Bene Gesserit dynamic).  It is almost uncanny how pitch-perfectly Chalamet combines arrogance, fresh-faced naivete, a sense of overwhelming duty, and a growing-rage at a prophesized destiny that he doesn't embrace.  It's a tough role, acting-wise, but he knocks it out of the park.

--There is a moment of Nolan-style sound editing when Paul and Jessica are in a sealed tent that is really, really unfortunate because what Paul says is absolutely essential to understanding his character arc.  He's talking about the Fremen gathering beneath his banner and spreading a bloody jihad across the galaxy.  While, of course, such a vision of the future is one that almost any sane man would embrace, Paul in that scene is very obviously conflicted about this putative destiny (and, as shown later, he can change the future once he becomes aware of it), but because of the sound design I would wager most of the audience completely missed a lot of what he was saying.  That's a pity.  

--Holy crap did they capture the ""book-essence"" of Arrakis.  The worms were incredible, and every single shot of a ship landing through the mist, or a cityscape through the mist, or anything involving smoke/mist, was simply beautiful.

--If there is a chink in D.V.'s armor as a filmmaker, for me thus far it has to be the fact that at times he seems to struggle in directing visceral, emotional moments that operate on a personal level.  He's the best in the business at world-building and scope, his eye for setting is beyond impeccable, he does tension amazingly well, he handles dramatic moments and emotional beats that call for gravitas superbly, but every once in a while a scene that should crackle with vital, in-the-moment human energy feels ""stagey.""  This issue crops up most often when he's depicting small-scale combat.  For example, when Idaho faces his death, I felt oddly disconnected ... maybe the camera wasn't lively enough or maybe the movements of the combatants were too dance-like?  Similarly, I felt that odd lack of vitality when Paul fights the Fremen-Who-Doesn't-Like-Outsiders.  It should feel desperate and draw us in, but instead it comes across like a tableau.    Considering that I know D.V. can rise to the occasion, as shown by the incredible mano a mano fight at the end of BR 2049 or the scene of Lady Jessica slumping over in concern for Paul when he was being tested, maybe what I'm detecting is intentional on his part.  Maybe he just wants everything to come across as epic ...",qd6vqv

hu0hg65,"Watched it over the weekend was fully immersed in the film however thinking about it, Dune would fit much better as a TV series, there's too much going on in the universe to fit into 1-3 films if they ever get there. After GOT ending this would be the perfect series.",qd6vqv
hhkyekh,"I’m having a tough time explaining what it feels like to someone who knows nothing about Dune, but what I’ve come up with:

It’s like Lord of the Rings, but with a third of the action, the elves are religious zealots obsessed with bloodlines, and the dwarves are drug addicts, and Frodo isn’t quite sure where Mt Doom is but he knows if he gets there he’s going to unleash a genocide upon the world.

It doesn’t really work as a good comparison.",qd6vqv
hhl675i,"This was obviously way better production value and a better adaptation than Lynch's version, but I feel like the weird / creepy David Lynch version of the Dune world is actually more aesthetically fitting than the toned down, more accessible Villeneueve interpretation.

hhwu0nd,"I’m in the minority here, but I didn’t really enjoy the movie that much. Maybe that will change after watching the sequel(haven’t read the books), but this movie doesn’t appear to have as much merit as a standalone movie given the runtime. The movie quite frankly felt way too long. I felt like I watched a short movie reach it’s climax with the battle and numerous deaths half way in. The movie felt like it should have ended there. It felt like after that, the second half was much slower from that point on. The second half felt more akin to a sequel than an extension of the movie. Not to say there weren’t parts I like about the movie, it had some of my favorite cinematography I have seen in a movie. Just can’t ignore that I was really wanting to movie to end in the last quarter of it.",qd6vqv

hhl90az,"Just saw the film and I really enjoyed it. I watched it on HBO Max, but I will *definitely* be going to see it in a theater soon. And while there were some minor details changed, it was also very faithful to the novel. 

A little minor nitpick though...I kind of wish the movie had included a nod to lasers+shields and to somehow address the policy on nuclear weapons. 

If I recall, the novel had a specific example where during the assault on Arrakeen someone deliberately placed a shield. In a visual medium such as this, it would have looked really cool to see a fucking nuclear explosion going off. 

Also, I could imagine some viewers thinking, ""okay...these guys actually have lasers, so why are they knife fighting instead of just shooting through their shields with lasers?""

But like I said, that's a tiny personal gripe. It's a great movie and I absolutely loved it.",qd6vqv
hhlguci,"Solid 8 out of 10 for me. Beautiful visuals, love Villeneuve style but sometimes everything felt kind of flat. And a bit rushed. I think Villeneuve did a good job with the pacing but there's a lot to tell. I wouldn't call the story confusing, necessarily, but perhaps ""muddled.""

This would have made an amazing miniseries IMO.

I read the book years back but don't remember much except enjoying it.

As a book reader it was a pretty fantastic adaption, with the standouts being:

- the incredible body horror of Baron Harkonnen

- the overall scope and scale which made it feel ever bit the epic it should

- the sound design and and terrifying use of the Voice by the ""good guys""

- The acting across the board which was excellent

- The score. What a score!

Some disappointing bits:

- Most side characters were barely sketched due to the heavy focus on Paul. Yueh, Thufir Hawat, and especially Piter de Vries were barely formed compared to their depth in the book.

- The big invasion battle was very hard to follow due to costuming and the way it was shot.",qd6vqv

hhvi5mj,"So much to say. I sure I will will just post bits and pieces in the next coming weeks.

To me Dune felt as good as the memory you have of your favorite movies, that aren't as good as you remember them. But Dune felt that good to me.

To me the craft of the film spoke loudly. The artistic choices, tonal choices, piecing it all together. I was in awe not only by the film, but the meta aspect of it just being an amazingly well crafted film.

The chemistry between Paul and Leto, and generally Paul's first scenes on Caladan didn't feel that impressive to me. Just sort of got the job done, I wasn't overly impressed with the acting. But by the end it made me feel like they purposely sort of threw away some beginning scenes just to have something to rise to.

I never felt like I knew what was coming, and I love sci fi and movies in general, so many feel predictable, just in a filmmaking sense. Also I read the book! I knew in terms of what story was going to unfold, but how it was done, How scenes and moments were edited together. Each scene was like a new visual feast, and I felt suspended in the present moment of the frames. It really did feel like a ride.

Its funny the book, although I enjoyed it...didn't capture me like it has so many people. I don't know maybe just being so exposed to its influences, a sci fi story about a Duke's son going to a new planet and being some sort of messiah, ok....nothing I haven't heard before. Albeit it is indeed really interesting and deep.

The movie even. I wasn't so blown away by the story this time around either. I mean I kind of know where its going etc, so my experience wasn't really hinging on that element. But the poetry of Paul's dreams, the horror of the Baron, the absolute spectacle of the designs and battles. It was like one epic scene after the next, and I think that's what achieved that sense of being on a ride. 

The Baron was truly scary, especially that scene at the diner table. His gown is so gross, and you really feel this intimating and predatory air about him. That foot dragging across the table when he was approaching Dr. Yueh. Terrifying and I don't easily get that reaction.

Another little detail I was surprised how it really carried impact was before Paul's fight with Jamis at the end. I really felt the fear, especially when it showed all of the Freman guy's staring down Paul. That felt like a real fight, the real fear of it. Another thing I dont really get from movies.

Can't wait to watch it again. I just felt so happy to see artists and cinema really doing what it can do. In this day and age with so much lack luster things flooded the big screen and small. It just feels good to celebrate something like Dune, something people can be proud of creating, something that really gives you hope and inspired you. Movies like Dune level up the culture, and the world. When you make something to put into the world, it should be like that. Great movie!",qd6vqv

hhvnaax,"Due to not really feeling that excited by the trailers, I went in expecting not to like this film all that much. But, I’m glad to say that it was one of the most sensorial and sweeping moviegoing experiences I’ve had in a while. I could have gone for a bit more emotional connection with the characters, and I wasn’t too hot on the screenplay, but the sheer scale, imagery, and evocative sound design were so great that I was able to overlook those flaws and just get swept up into the world. It truly felt like a tone poem, which we get so few of on this scale. I’m excited now to finally dig into the book, and I’m crossing my fingers that we get a Part Two.",qd6vqv

hi6bwj8,"Two things they left out that bothered me:

(1)

When Jessica meets the Shadout Mapes, they omitted parts of the explanation of the significance of a crysknife. You cannot sheathe it before drawing blood. Any outsider who sees one must die.

At first, the audience is supposed to just think that's part of the Fremen culture, but then you realize, crysknives have to be kept secret because it would reveal that the Fremen can control the worms.

(2) It's crucial that Paul cries over Jamis. Maybe this will still happen in Part 2.",qd6vqv
hi7yowt,"Good sound mixing.


I like how they made Leto a good father and capable duke who understands the political games that are going on. Wished they talk or show more of the political maneuvering.

I didn’t like how with all these futuristic tech and spaceships, we still get analog buttons and switches . Star Wars have the same problem..I guess this is what happens when the book is written back in the 60s.

Jamis fight scene felt really rushed. They just met and dude straight up hating on Paul. If they expanded a bit more I feel like the fight scene would’ve carried more weight.",qd6vqv
hihhlpa,"the editing was... off. the cuts came too frequently and if you look at the setups they have in each scene, it makes no sense why they would cut when they do. it seems like no shot lasts more than 4 or 5 seconds where i think the director's style--which is on display in spades here--needs longer wide takes to absorb the atmosphere. you'd begin to get into an image and it would cut immediately to a close-up or medium-shot that didn't seem to do anything other than interrupt the atmosphere's weight. i also think hans zimmer's score did a number on the film, and someone with a bit more punch and melodic sensibility should have been picked, like clint mansell. 

overall a solid flick, but bogged down in the cutting room with poor editing choices and a regrettable score.",qd6vqv
hioyl1j,"The Jordan desert is exactly how I pictured Arrakis

Every actor's performance was great but Piter was too placid - he should have had a more sinister demeanor. Was going to suggest he be more like Gríma Wormtongue from the LOTR movie and realized the same actor, Brad Dourif, played Piter in Lynch's Dune - haha

Also had trouble hearing the dialogue by Yueh and little to no mention of his imperial conditioning. The book goes to great lengths to tell the reader why there's no way Yueh could be the mole, only to later reveal the shocking twist that Yueh is the mole.

Disappointed in the portrayal of the *weirding way*. Was hoping for a fast teleportation-looking effect, (similar to way the vampire Frost moves in [Blade](https://youtu.be/XrrxBLkEeTo?t=81), or the Necromonger in [Chronicles of Riddick](https://youtu.be/1qeS6c4ezpU?t=51))  instead we got run-of-the-mill martial arts choreography.

Ornithopters and body shields were well done. Audio for '*the voice*' was superb and shook the theater

A great scifi movie, but reenforces how hard it is to make a Dune movie and gives me more appreciation for Lynch's attempt. Jorwodowski might have been onto something with his proposed 9 hour runtime",qd6vqv
hiz4i5z,"Wish they made more of an effort to actually show that ""the slow blade gets the kill"" during fight scenes.

hlgyr8r,"I had the chance to see Dune today, and boy does it deliver. As usual with Denis, the cinematography is out of this world (pun intended) and the cast on point.

But I think what may be the best part of the movie is the pacing itself: slow for sure, and some may find it boring, but I truly believe it magnifies the overwhelming scale of the universe and the stakes of the story. 

Sure, some parts of the plot could have been strengthened, but overall this is no generic sci-fi movie, an incredible feat, and I am eagerly waiting for part 2.",qd6vqv
hhl9p3z,"I'm rather surprised just how much wasn't in this. Just finished watching it, but here's the list of things I noted were absent or not very well developed:

* The Bene Gesserit are somewhat explained, although only briefly in a handful of scenes
* The Kwisatz Haderach is mentioned only once at the very end of the movie, and we never really understand the legend of him, who he is, or what he's intended to do
* Virtually no mention of the Spacing Guild
* No mention of Guild Navigators
* No depictions of folding space
* The Emperor is mentioned, but not by name and is never seen
* We see nothing of Kaitan or Ix any of the other planets of the Landsraad 
* Mentats are shown, but never explained or expanded on
* No Feyd-Rautha

I guess they could be planning to put some of this in the next movie, but it seems like a bunch of pretty important stuff just got pushed aside. Even the Harkonnens were rather 2-dimensional. Baron Vladimir is one of the most memorable characters in the whole book, but he's barely seen and scantly utilized in this movie. 

Say what you want about Lynch's version, but at least he managed to cover a lot more bases than this movie did.",qd6vqv
hhlni9g,"Anyone else notice how weird it is that Paul Atreides's mom is only like a decade older than him, going by Chalamet and Fergusson's ages? Fergusson looks even younger than her actual age. She's great in the film but couldn't they have gotten someone a little bit older? Was she like 12 when she had him? This is the wildest age disparity since the mom and daughter on What About Bob were only 10 years apart in real life age.",qd6vqv
hhl1rw7,"Watching this I knew nothing about Dune except it was old. I was kind of comparing it to Star Wars.  I was surprised to learn it was published in 1965.

Guess I know what books I'm reading next.",qd6vqv
hhm896h,Am I the only one that wished they had gone a little different in the casting? Some characters were just so recognizable it took me a bit to get into it. Like jason mamoa and Dave baustia specifically. Regardless I fucking loved this movie,qd6vqv
hhmg9ke,"I liked the movie well enough. I don't really love the first Dune book either, despite how much of it I find interesting.

It was actually surprising how straightforward an adaptation this was largely though I feel some different choices could have been made to give more focus to what ally els like r of trpltft portion of the book it's adapting.  The movie just really breezed right past everything Dr. Yueh, the scramble to find who betrayed them etc. What in the book is very tense and feels like tightening noose just kinds of glides on past here.

It's also just kind of the structure of the story being told and the split of the book but along with the Harkonen attack and the betrayal never feeling that tense, there's just a whole lot of movie afterwards. The split happens more or less where I expected it to, and is sensible, but for the film as it stands feels a little odd. I wasn't bored exactly  but the last third of the films feels a little slack.

I love thee look of all he ships. The effects all feel entirely tangible and in IMAx you can really feel the scale. It's like they they took the temple aircraft hanger from Yavin 4 in Star Wars and we're like ""the temple IS the aircraft.""
The film suffers a bit from a fairly uniform application of Villeneuve's costuming sensibilities. Everything's feel's lived in but a little overly samey between the various factions. I dig the space guild a lot.",qd6vqv
hhmp2md,"The movie was fantastic. Cinematography and soundtrack/sound design were far and away the best aspects. Unbelievably gorgeous movie.

I honestly wish Chalamet wasn't as... Chalamet? I thought he did very well, just didn't melt into the role quite as well as others. 

Jason Momoa was fucking great, and I really wish more of him was in the movie. Same with Brolin. Both of their dialogue delivery was amazing. The ""Brutal"" scene with Brolin was great. He really sold the desperation of what was about to happen in the move to Arrakis. 

In terms of the Villeneuve movies I've seen (BR, Arrival, Sicario) this is probably my least favorite, but only because those other three are so god damn incredible. Dune is also my favorite book, so I was going to be pretty critical of it going in. He did such a great job of making the world feel alive and desperate, which are far and away the best aspects of the book.",qd6vqv

hhuli8d,"I've seen it twice now, and am in love. I'm a lifelong Dune fan, and I've been waiting for an adaptation like this for decades. It isn't perfect, because ""perfect"" for me would mean it would need to be 4 hours for part one and millions of people would hate that. I thought they struck the perfect balance between explaining things thoroughly, and making it enjoyable for the masses. People who are actually upset that the mentants and Yueh didn't get enough airtime would find something else to complain about if those scenes were included. I'd love to see these scenes too, but the things that were cut for time were the right things to cut in my opinion.

I'm HOPING it's a trilogy, with extended edition home releases, just like LOTR. Not holding my breath, but that's my hope. Keep the theatrical cut on HBO Max for the masses, and then sell the extended edition to those of us who want that sort of thing.",qd6vqv

Like explaining what mentats are and why they don't have computers, or why Dr. Yueh's betrayal is ironic since his class forbids him from causing harm. They also didn't explain why their society uses body shields and swords instead of guns. It wouldn't have taken long, maybe a few minutes of dialogue at most. 

I'm also salty they didn't put in the scene where the Baron and Piter are plotting together. That had amazing dialogue in the book.

Anyways, while the movie was good, I think something with as much content as Dune really deserves a mini series.",qd6vqv
hibq9b8,"I'll be honest. Going into Dune I didn't know what to expect. I never read the book(s?) and if anything I was predisposed to disliking it because of all the hype it was getting. Likewise, I'm normally not a sci-fi guy because I just find a lot of it to be a bit too much for me. But holy crap was I impressive by Dune. The pacing felt really good, parts very well acted, and script was sci-fi but not *too sci-fi*. For a film with a lot going on it was suprisingly easy to follow. Mamoa was the best I've seen him yet and Skarsgard was fantastic. If you would have told me 2 days ago that I'd be hyped for a Dune sequel I wouldn't have believed it but here we are. The only sin I'd say is I would have liked to see more city before it was destroyed and some more time with the fremon would have been nice.

I watched this movie and I was interested for about half the movie and then it just draggeeedddd.

hk36hkb,"As someone who hasn’t read the books, the abrupt cliffhanger ending was disappointing. I don’t know if it was intentional and just going by the book(s?) but I’ve always disliked cliffhangers in movies. They belong in series in my opinion. 

That being said, going in entirely blind even without a trailer, I loved every bit. The atmosphere and lore was fascinating and interesting. The pacing and narrative was fantastic. Only thing I disliked was that (at home with a sound bar) the dialogue was a little difficult to hear at times with there being quite a lot of whispering. Other than that, a great movie and I’m certainly interested in reading the book or books.",qd6vqv
hkk7vgi,"I'm halfway through the film right now and can I just say the cinematography, the music, the acting, the story - this movie is amazing.",qd6vqv
hl2wan0,"Honestly the most interesting aspect of the new movie was the very brief depiction of the mentat.  I always thought the books did a really poor job showing exactly what the mentat did or was, we are simply told that computers are outlawed and that mentats are trained to be very strong thinkers, analyzers, and are ""human computers""... but the way it is shown in the books doesn't really show it to be anything special (in my opinion).  However, the movie took this and made it something real, the way Hawat's eyes turned white as if he was inwardly thinking, and quickly did a crazy complicated calculation and spoke quickly as if he was literally a computer for a moment, it felt so strange and inhuman and sci-fi, I loved it so much and it really gave me a new concept that I could actually grasp onto when thinking of ""the mentat"" even though I've already read the first 4 books.  


I also though the way Paul showed pain with the box was awesome.. he looked actually in intense pain... and then that sudden control and defiance, and looking up at the Reverend Mother... that was really good.  


As for things I really didn't like: The Baron was utterly boring and cliche evil.  In the book he was way more maniacal, scary, and sometimes bumbling, constantly talking and indulging himself.  The interplay between him and his mentat Piter was so good that I was really looking forward to seeing how Piter was depicted, since those were some of the most interesting scenes for me.  In the book I absolutely loved when the Baron signaled Piter to kill Doctor Yueh, and then moments later he freaks and scolds Piter for killing the doctor too quickly because they realize the ring is missing, even though he literally just told Piter to do it.  Instead in the movie we get a typical deep voice brooding evil man evil-y staring at everyone but not showing much else, and Piter is almost entirely overlooked as a character and then killed, we barely get to see him do any mentat things which is disappointing because the mentat aspect was subtly illustrated to be something very intriguing in the movie.    


I also didn't like that the spice seemed to be fairly minor in Part 1, Paul's realization in the tent when Leto dies, the fact that he can suddenly see into the future and past and suddenly knows like everything about everything, that whole thing is probably the most intense and exciting moment in the whole book, Paul realizing he is the Kwizatz Haderach, but it was mainly lack-luster in the movie and didn't really explain what was going on.  In fact all of Paul's experiences of prescience are underplayed.",qd6vqv
hlquo8g,"Man I really wanted to like this movie but it felt like style over substance and I can’t help but feel like we’re missing a lot from the books that makes this story work more. I hear about the lack of water being a bigger deal and stuff like that.

I spent like half of the main battle wondering why the Emperor bothered to tell the Harkonnen to leave so that the Atreides could go there just for the Harkonnen to come back and kill them all with the Emperor’s secret approval…?

The characters and dialogue were overall a little dull, but the visuals and scale were really great. It was just barely interesting enough that I want to see the sequel to see how it plays out. I just think the pacing was off and it was missing some compelling details.",qd6vqv

hhlajfj,"It's insane that this is a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE movie in scale, budget and so on and yet tonight there is a new episode of a FREAKING TELEVISION SHOW (Foundation) which rivals it in just about every way (visually, set design, CGI, etc). Mind blowing. 

I really enjoyed the movie and I beg to the movie gods it gets a sequel (and more). I suspect this movie will be even better when Part II and even Part III come out and you watch them all at once. Unlike Star Wars and LOTR I feel like this first movie in the Dune saga doesn't stand on its own as well individually but when put together with the future installments it will be the perfect puzzle piece required to start this saga. 

I'd say my only complaint which isn't really a complaint but more so an observation, that I'm not sure if it was a creative decision or not, is that everything felt SO huge, epic and massive in scale that by comparison the world being shown felt scarce of people and life. I get that's just a fact with a desert planet but with huge ships, huge buildings, huge planets, huge landscapes and so on it was odd seeing just 1-100 people in the shots. I'm used to say Star Wars (6-8) where things felt more inhabited, lived in, and full. As massive in scale as Coruscant was it was buzzing with activity, people and such. As empty as Tatooine was once you got to a city it was bustling with activity and people. So by comparison Dune felt like HUGE sets and landscapes that had just a few people in them.",qd6vqv

BUT I just didn't find myself caring about any of the characters. The movie tho.. was uninteresting. Jason Momoa also felt so out of place. Every time he talked or gave his lines it just seemed so forced/amateur.

The rest of the cast was solid in character portrayal, line delivery and acting. Altho at times I really struggled to make out what some characters were saying. I feel like the movie accomplished what it was going for and is one of the best portrayals of Science Fiction on film in years. I can see why people would like it, and I do appreciate what it accomplished as an art form. But I also don't care to ever watch it again.

Overall they nailed almost everything except keeping me entertained and immersed enough to really like it. The movie is highly forgettable. But I still appreciate what it accomplished in scope and vision. 6/10",qd6vqv
hhl5xgw,"Did the dialogue seem...tonally inconsistent to anyone else? At times it was quite stiff and almost Shakespearian, and then characters would sound very modern or informal (especially Mamoa, Paul saying ""dad"" and ""father,"" ""THAT WAS INSANE!"", etc.)",qd6vqv
hhovxzn,"I’ve never read the books so I had no idea what I was in for in when I watched today, but it just seemed lacking in dialogue. It was so hard to pay attention to just scene after scene of just pure sound and visual-no matter how great they may have been. It was easily the prettiest movie I’ve seen, with Blade Runner 2049 and La La Land as runner ups. I was lucky that I was so entranced by the cinematography because otherwise I don’t think I would’ve lasted the two and a half hours. I also honestly expected a little more from Hans Zimmer (I hate saying that) but after Interstellar and Inception having some notorious and specific “songs” if you will, Dune just seemed to have the same droning going on the whole time. Overall a 6/10, I definitely understand how it has a full and great plot, it was visually stunning, but for me lacking in dialogue and music!",qd6vqv
hhkl5mh,"This is the most conflicted I've felt about a film in a while but on the balance of things it shakes out at a solid 7/10

A visually stunning, terrifically acted sci-fi epic filled with magnificent world-building, but also a bit of an unfeeling slog?

Was really into the first half but once the story had to fully kick in my interest definitely began to wane. The narrative is a lot less interesting than everything else around it - Herbert fans don't hurt me! - and just didn't really reach my heart much at all.

I'd still recommend it as a good film for sure, but absolutely recommend tempering your expectations if you're hoping for the Next Great Epic. Masterfully crafted from an aesthetic standpoint but I also felt kinda exhausted (not in a good way) by the end. I say this as someone who thought BLADE RUNNER 2049 wasn't a minute too long.

The comparisons to LOTR and Star Wars feel wildly out of step to me. I really don't think this is going to register on the same level with the general public.

hhkldzk,"So this is from the perspective of someone who’s halfway through the book (about 50 pages before where the movie ends). 

Firstly, I was really impressed with how faithful the film was to the book. The only omissions or alterations I noticed were inconsequential and just a byproduct of changing mediums from text to film.   Ie: Paul’s abilities are more fleshed out in the book simply because you’re constantly hearing his own stream of consciousness. 

A few things I absolutely loved were how The Voice was portrayed. Holy shit was that heavy and forceful and really did an incredible job of conveying the power that it is. It was very matter-of-fact in the book but the movie added sooo much gravitas to it.  

I *loved* the Baron’s look and presence. It was so menacing, and grotesque, and impossible to look away from. It could have so easily been campy or over the top but I think they absolutely NAILED the Baron as a character. 

I saw it in IMAX and will just say the very obvious in that the film was gorgeous, the explosions were so incredibly stunning, and the audio was just piercing and rumbling and encompassing. 

The casting was so spot on, especially Duncan, Gurney and the Baron. 

My only gripes, which are minor, are that the film does feel like it has this amazing crescendo in the attack on the Atreides and Paul and Jessica’s escape - and then it gradually winds down a bit with it curling back up with the duel with the Fremen - and then the end with the on the nose line “this is only the beginning”.  And also that the film was a little too dark (brightness wise) as Paul and Jessica ran from the sandworm. Like it made sense given that there was no sun or moon at the moment but I would have preferred to see the sandworm in all its toothy glory. 

Cannot wait for the second part. The film definitely feels like a part one of two in that it didn’t really complete it’s arc, but that’s expected and understandable. I think this movie will be looked on in an even better light once part two is out.",qd6vqv
hhkwvb1,"I don't know how I feel about this one yet. I love Denis Villeneuve's films. Blade Runner 2049 is a sci fi classic, and Dune definitely evoked the same feelings of awe I had watching that film. This movie looks incredible. The sweeping desert landscapes and the models are gorgeous. However, pacing and dialogue is where Dune really doesn't measure up. Denis can do meditative sci-fi, but if he's trying to compete with Marvel and Star Wars, then mission failed. Dune is inaccessible to audiences who aren't already in love with this story and this world. There's only so much sci-fi jargon you can throw at people before their brains short circuit. Moreover, the movie has a very awkward abrupt ending. The performances were mostly good, standouts being Stellan Skarsgaard, Oscar Isaac, and Rebecca Ferguson. It's not that anyone did bad per se, more just that they didn't have as much to work with.",qd6vqv
hhl8dtc,"Just finished it. I'm mixed on it.

Its an absolutely gorgeous movie. Beautiful to look at. The sound design is great. A lot of the actors do a great job in their roles.

That said, huge pacing issues I found. Very weirdly paced from act to act. The ending was also very abrupt I felt. I know it's supposed to be leading to part 2, obvious, but still, super abrupt.",qd6vqv
hhkjhwy,Movie got a little slow at times but it was all worth the build up. The ending gave me chills. There better be a part 2.,qd6vqv
hhkss78,"Up until the last 2 lines is was a solid A+

“Desert power” and “this is only the beginning” completely took me out of it.

hhmbmaq,"I was mildly troubled about some of the rumors around the film, but they turned out to be just that. As a huge fan of the books, that 2.5 hours flew by. I was blown away. The only criticism I can manage is that I wanted more of everything, especially some of the main characters (sans Paul and Jessica as we got to see plenty of them). 

The sound was amazing and even though I watched from home (I do have a decent, 1000 watt home theater and 60' tv), I could appreciate it. 

I look forward to multiple viewings, but more importantly part 2. My God, make this happen!",qd6vqv
hhmxkul,"I didn’t want it to end, I loved the look the feel the acting the dialogue. I can’t wait for part two.",qd6vqv
hhnfeq5,"I already saw it in theaters in Europe, but did a second watch on HBO Max today. On first watch I wasn't sure what I thought about the movie, because I was comparing everything to how I imagined it in the book so the differences really jumped out. No mention of Mentats, CHOAM, the Spacing Guild? But then I remembered that an adaptation is always that, an adaptation. Translating the book to the screen page by page wouldn't automatically make it a good movie. It has to work on its own.

Now after a second watch I feel more able to judge the film on its own merits. A lot of characterisation and backstory is indeed left out, but I feel the most of the movie works fine despite that. I'd compare it to Tom Bombadil being left out of the LOTR movies; many book readers were outraged, but the films work fine without that bit of lore and are big enough already.

Ultimately I feel that the first 2/3rds of this movie are great. Maybe not a masterpiece, but very very good. But the 3rd act is definitely too slow and anticlimactic. I think it might have been a better idea making the attack on Arrakeen the climax of the movie, with Leto dying and Paul and Jessica being stranded in the desert as a cliffhanger. That would have allowed room for every character to be developed a bit more. It's a pretty early point in the book to cut it off, but I think that all of the Fremen story could be effectively condensed in a second movie and work fine. Anyhow, I liked the movie a lot, but it has some flaws. That's okay.",qd6vqv
hho3yqh,"Great movie, makes me want to read the book",qd6vqv
hho5u1y,"Honestly, my only complain was I think at times the film was missing a few transitionary scenes to make things feel a bit less coincidental or jarring (specifically: Duncan finding Kynes and Duncan finding Jessica/Paul both needed something in there, and maybe a beat before Kynes gets killed that makes it come off as a bit .. stupid on her end).   


Other than that, and the fact that it's 'Part 1' to the fullest degree, it lived up to the my expectations.   


Oh .. and, goddamnit, I wanted the dinner scene from the book. That was some primo Thronesian-political conversation and was riveting in the novel. It was really the only thing I \*missed\*.",qd6vqv
hhoh3fn,"Worst cuts for me

-Failed to fully illustrate the unbeleivably high value of water. Stilgar spitting is the equivolent of someone giving you their pinkie finger. It is an insane act of respect and the film handwaved it in a gag 

-Cut paul crying. That was an integral part of the fremen's burgeoning respect for him. It seemed like he was about to, but he didnt. curious 

-Not explaining there are no computers in the world. Its pretty big for fully understanding dune. The existence of mentats and spice is p. much because of this, but it is not even hinted at once 

-Cutting too many character moments. TBH its part of the reason this felt like a TV pilot to so many people. Its too swift",qd6vqv

hhpvs0w,"My biggest issue with the movie was that I felt little to no emotional impact during any of the deaths of the characters. I don't feel like we got nearly enough time to feel a real sense of loss.

Like, Duncan was cool, but he was around for **maybe** 20 minutes total. Papa Atreides was around for a little while longer, but I didn't much care that he died as well.",qd6vqv
hhq9g1g,"The visuals they showed of the guild heighliner were just amazing. The sheer colossal scale came across stunningly! Though I must say, they really glossed over them. We saw three shots of them total, and never even alluded to space folding (that I recall, at least). It seems an odd choice to gloss over such an integral part of the narrative and conflict in that. Perhaps they'll have that in the next film (here's hoping we get it!)",qd6vqv
hhqblop,"Watched it for the second time last night with my dad and sister via HBOMAX.

While I dare say that the experience in the theater was more immersive, the colors and sound were better via streaming. 

Dad and sister had no prior knowledge of anything Dune besides both being aware there is a book and earlier attempt to make a film; both really enjoyed it and can’t wait for Part Two. 

Afterwards both asked questions but “I’m interested in the world” and not “I need clarification “, so that was cool.",qd6vqv
hhqgfyj,It’s so satisfying to have your expectations met. I got fully absorbed by the movie and could see the care put in to making the source material something marvelous but real and down to earth (or Arrakis I guess). I hope other people enjoyed it as much as I did.,qd6vqv
hhr352w,It was so nice to see this film on the big screen. Denis is at the absolute top of his game. The film oozes with atmosphere.

I cannot wait for part 2.,qd6vqv
hhrcir1,"One major thing different from the book is the constant reminder of water being scarce in Arrakis. Every conversation in book ends with emphasis on water's importance in Arrakis.

hhrz39t,"Thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this movie. But as time past by and I realized that I'm watching the 3rd act I really started to think ""is this it"" and it kinda took me out also. 

I'm a bit disappointed, but overall I have to applaud Villeneuve for the courage and vision of making such a film (and I know it sounds circle-jerky). The first 90 minutes of this were a total experience and we need more films like this being made. 

Great little dramas like let's say ""Marriage Story"" are great films, but they can be made by european film industry, or the korean, whichever you like. I'm not worried about films like those disappearing due to streaming, there will always be people who make them. Films like Dune can be made only in Hollywood and even as a casual movie watcher I'm very much afraid of studios turning all films into TV movies over streaming. 

I hope Dune succeeds, but I'm not optimistic.",qd6vqv
hhsxkc0,"I loved the books and read them ages ago, but there were a great many things left out of the movie or shown with absolutely no explanation that are really important.

hht1eq2,Thanos and Drax in a Dune movie. Epic!,qd6vqv
hht1hc5,"One thing that's not mentioned in the film in detail, but does add understanding the Fremen decision to follow Jessica / Paul is that the Bene Gesserit (The black sisters and also Pauls Mother Jessica) have already been to Ariakis and implanted the roots of a religion that they themselves created. My recollection is that they do this on every world, to make it easier for them if they have to visit for whatever reason. This is why Jessica is able to pick out the Shadout Mapes and also able to answer her questions regarding their culture and the Crisknife.",qd6vqv

One liberty I would love to see in part 2 is a confrontation between Gurney and Rabban. I don’t think Denis will let Rabban disappear from the story as in the book. Does anyone else have any ‘love to see’ variants,qd6vqv
hhuumcs,"Having read the novel and seen both the 1984 film and the 2000 Sci-fi Channel miniseries, I was definitely deeply impressed. The visuals were stunning, the imagining of the technologies was unexpected, and it follows the novel very closely. It definitely feels like a political intrigue fantasy story in a sci-fi time. The characters follow their novel counterparts closely.

If I had to pick at it, I'd say I wish the movie padded out another thirty minutes with more character development. I feel like many of the characters and some features were simply glossed over. Thufir doesn't get enough time showing his abilities, save for one scene which looked very cool and is what I would expect from a human computer. I wish I had gotten to seen Gurney make some music, though the rest of his character fits the novel well. Doctor Wellington was glossed over a lot. The Baron didn't quite feel...weird or threatening or evil enough like in the novel and I think they shied away from showing his more threatening sexual appetites that even the 1984 film hinted at. But I suppose there's always something to criticize and it's easy to make points from this side of the movie, I understand making it is a monumental task and I don't want to make it seem like this isn't an incredible film.",qd6vqv

hhyck27,"I'm a huge fan of the book and a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve and was super excited for this movie.  There's a lot I love about the movie, but I think it's important to provide honest criticism where warranted.  
  
The Good  

* Art Design  
 * The cinematography is beautiful and the art design is flawless.  Denis has always been very very good with this in his movies.  I don't know if he works with the same team for every movie but he consistently nails this.  
* Acting
 * Once again, Denis has always been fantastic in this category and this movie doesn't disappoint here.  
* Faithfulness to the source material
 * A lot of movies and shows that are based on source material tend to divert heavily away from the source material in favor of a Studio or Director's personal vision (example:  The Witcher show is very different from the books).  Denis really captures the source material perfectly.  
  
The Criticism  

* The movie feels too slow and too rushed at the same time (I know... that doesn't seem to make sense... I'll explain.  
 * To slow:  The movie lingers on multiple scenes that are beautiful but don't contribute a huge amount to the plot by lingering.  Dialogue tends to be soft spoken and feel drawn out.  Just to be clear, this is faithful to the books but when transitioning to a movie, I worry that many viewers will feel the movie bores them at times.  
 * Too Rushed:  The movie jumps right into the thick of the plot and large events happen very quickly.  Caladan has a few things happen then they're on Dune (which is totally faithful), Then they see a harvester, then they are betrayed, then they flee.  These are a lot of major events in 1 movie and I wonder if a mini-series would have served the narrative better.  In the book, there's a lot of internal thoughts and exposition that fleshes out the politics and how everyone feels about it so it's easy for a reader to follow along and understand what's happening and why.  I fear the movie will leave people, who didn't read the book, confused.  
  
As a book reader, I loved this adaption, but I'm concerned by its fate and would have preferred if some scenes and characters got fleshed out more.",qd6vqv
hhyh763,"My only real complaint is they made the Baron more evil stupid than he needed to be. The line “kill the freman” is opposite his approach in the book which is to bleed them. He preaches to Feyd often about how throwing away your resources is extremely dumb. Other than that, SO many well done things and great nods to the book. My favorite and lowkey one probably being how most of the Atreides are olive skinned whereas Paul is light skinned, and Lady Jessica even moreso like the Harkonens given that lineage. Such a faithful yet distinctly different adaptation.",qd6vqv
hi0bt72,"Definitely happy that I went with IMAX. The sound and visual combination in that theater was electrifying, and extremely immersive. It had the same positive quality that I enjoyed so much watching Arrival and BR2049 in a similar setting.",qd6vqv
hi0ikx9,"So I never read the book, but as a child of the 80s, I really liked Lynch’s movie. I know a lot of Dune purists say that it’s wrong- but as I’m watching this new film(I’m not done yet), I feel like it’s a toned down version of the 80s film. 

I actually liked to hear everyone’s inner monologue in the 80s movie. At first it’s weird, but you get used to it quickly. I also liked how weird it was. It felt very other worldly- the Harkonens were scary and there was gas coming out from everywhere and it felt like the air was toxic. 

Maybe the Baron didn’t have the skin problems that Lynch gave him but that was hideous and freaky. And he was murderous and psychotic. Maybe it was off- but for a movie- it scared the shit out of me. 

Again- most of the scenes are the same as the 80s ones- with the exception of all the white people in the original. The worms look cooler in this one, and they do a better job with the blue stained eyes. 

I dunno- it’s not bad but it’s like a toned down version of the 80s movie.",qd6vqv
hi1v2jo,"Also, the entire House of Atrides and allies are all annoyingly attractive to the extent it's distracting.",qd6vqv
hi34ca4,"I enjoyed the movie, but I should mention that:

\- I saw it on IMAX, that truly amplifies its visual and aural qualities

\- I was familiar with the source material and I know that, behind all the fireworks, Dune has a fairly simplistic narrative and obvious allegories (Villeneuve’s virtuosity suggests there’s something grander going on between the lines, but the story lacks substance to back his ambitions)

\- I understand the world-building is so complex (no wonder Dune was considered an unadaptable book for so long) that it was inevitable that a movie produced in this scale, with so many financial resources involved, would rely heavily on exposition

For me, the decision to split the first book into two movies (and following its first half so closely) comes with a cost. Part 1 doesn’t have a payoff, conventional script beats, nothing resembling of a climax, or a narrative that, even though its open-ended, feels whole and satisfactory on its own (like Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings did so well).

But the main problem is that the film isn’t able to present its mythology as it should – we’re still learning about the planet’s ecology, the do’s and don’ts of the supernatural powers and so on, up until the end. It’s hard to get invested on a story that’s so open, and I wonder if it wouldn’t work better as a 6-hour miniseries (we've seen many TV shows produced with movie budgets in the last few years) instead of leaving so much to interpretation.",qd6vqv

And the invasion scene was one of the coolest things ever. Was also surprised to see the big actors dropping like flies throughout lol- Oscar Isaac was so good. Jason momoa too.

hig1onx,"I really liked it, but a few parts felt... just a tiny bit off.  The city was impressive, but it seemed oddly... Abandoned?  You could see mounds of sand pilling up in corners but never any people.  No little markets, no hanging tapestries or decoration.  It looks like an old abandoned shipyard.

Also just a few of those vistas had a bit of CGI gloss to them.  Maybe I'm getting overly sensitive to that stuff, but I feel like it could have been given more attention.

In terms of visual effects, the lasers were one of my favorite parts.  Barely visible, as laser should be.  Only visible when they slam into something and throw out debris that intersects the beam.",qd6vqv
higdxvo,"I did not like what they did to my girl Jessica. I felt her characterization was so off.

Asthetically, she looked fine, but I felt she was way to distraught and emotional, while in the book there is a huge emphasis on her controlling her emotions, paying attention to detail, and being a master manipulator. 

They also didn't develop her relationship with the Duke at all, expect for a throw away line about how she wasn't a wife.

Why didn’t the Fremen guy directly challenge Lady Jessica to fight instead of asking for her to put forth some sort of representative like in Game of Thrones?  Is it just basic sexism in their culture? Given the knife Zendaya had, I didn’t think that would be the case.

hho15gh,"I feel bad for anyone not familiar with the book. They barely explain spice and completely avoid the Butlerian Jihad. The reason they need spice for the space navigators is that they've abolished computers in the universe. The psychoactive and prophetic properties of the spice allow them to predictively navigate, rather than using programs in the ship. That's also why they need mentats, which were really not explained at all in the movie. They have mentats constantly ingesting a special drink to do complex mental calculations, as they aren't allowed to use computers. In Lynch's Dune (and in the book) they have the red liquid stained around their lips from that drink, in this dune they just have a single line on their bottom lip.",qd6vqv
hhqdpie,"I'm really conflicted on this movie. On one hand, it's a really good spectacle, and beautiful to watch. Performances were top notch, and despite the PG-13 goal, they still managed to make the movie look and feel threatening. You really felt Paul and Jessica's true feelings as they were being chased by the Harkonnan's. 

On the other, even with the 2 and a half hour runtime, the story still feels undercooked, and at times, could have been supplemented with more dialogue. And it's pretty unsatisfying, feels like the start to a big TV show, rather then a feature length film. 

Gonna wait till Part 2 to come out until I make my last judgement, because it feels a 5-6 hour movie split into 2, but right now, I don't think I'll rewatch it anytime soon.

A little bit of political tension, but you don’t even get a clear antagonist until over half way through. Certainly no resolution to anything. 

I think it’ll be great once the whole series is out, but right now it barely even feels like a whole movie in its own right that can be watched and enjoyed in isolation.",qd6vqv
hhwtfnc,Dull. I felt no passion behind this movie. It felt like it was only trying to get to part 2. While Lynch's Dune is a mess at least you could feel the passion behind it. This version is just lifeless and empty.,qd6vqv
hhko85g,The soundtrack sounded good but it didn’t really feel like any particular track was edited in to coincide with a scene,qd6vqv
hhoze37,"Just finished watching it.  I thought it was fine.  Visually stunning, a spectacle in every sense of the word.  And it was faithful to the book in that they managed to capture the plot and present it intelligibly, which is no small feat.  

But it was a little frustrating, too.  The pacing was somehow both breathlessly fast and oddly stilted.  I felt like all of the characters either spoke in hushed riddles, or just took turns making melodramatic pronouncements to each other.  At least in the books, people had actual conversations.  I'm not saying they should have Sorkin-ed it, but I think there's a happy middle that could have been found.  

And they left out so much texture in the characters and their interactions.  So many little things that wouldn't have taken any extra time.  Gurney had his inkvine scar, but he never explained that a Harkonnen gave it to him.  Shadout Mapes didn't do anything except gasp, and then gasp and die.  The Duke spotted the sandworm, but they left out the part where he distributed the spotter bonus to the other spotters.  Kynes was there when the Duke rescued the crawler crew, but they didn't show how it informed her later decision to help Paul and Jessica.  And they referred to Kynes as Liet right away!  There was no buildup of Liet as this mysterious Fremen leader, which meant there was no big reveal of Kynes as Liet, for the viewers or for Paul and Jessica. 

I think the biggest misstep was leaving out the subplot about Thufir suspecting Jessica as a traitor.  I understand the time constraints, but it stripped out so much tension, and gutted the motivations of several characters.  Thufir basically had nothing to do.  In the books, the hunter-seeker attack ratcheted up the paranoia for the traitor hunt, but in the movie its just a thing that happened.  And because there was no traitor hunt, Dr. Yueh's betrayal came completely out of nowhere.  Also, the movie had no real reason for conflict between the Duke and Jessica, so they just sort of spun their wheels in their scenes together.  

I actually would have preferred to spend less time on the Sardaukar invasion, because that was honestly pretty lifeless.  I think it would have been more effective to show most of that night from the perspective of Paul and Jessica, with the only wide shot being the one after the 'thopter crash, when they look out on Arrakeen burning.  Lean into the confusion, like the book did.  

Looking back on what I wrote, this seems like a negative review but it's not.  I just feel like they focused on a bunch of stuff that was just fine, at the expense of other things that could have made the story great.",qd6vqv
hhkjcfv,"This was a visual spectacle, everything from the sound and visual effects to the costumes and shots were just breathtaking. Literally one of my best Dolby experiences ever. On the story side though, I thought it was a little lackluster, or I guess it just didn’t live up to the standard set by just how amazing it looks, feels, and sounds. There was quite a bit of exposition, which I understand is needed, but it got in the way of some character development and emotional depth. Also, a lot of slow-motion, which sometimes looked cool as fuck but other times was a bit much. Overall a solid 8/10 for me",qd6vqv
hhm7ln8,"this movie just really didn't do it for me. for as much world building and as many characters as there were, i really feel like this should've been a TV series instead. i totally understand the reasoning behind wanting to make it a movie, but i feel like it wouldve been able to really shine and develop better as a series. 


most of the actions felt rushed or unexplained and so much information is thrown at you incredibly fast it becomes almost difficult to follow at times. also not having subtitles (watched in imax) really kicked my ass, i could barely understand most of the dialogue.

however i will say that the score, visuals, and sound FX were PHENOMENAL.",qd6vqv
hhtuc6n,"Anyone want to talk about how uneven the dialogue was? First half was beautifully written, like they were trying to write a masterpiece.  Second half had the actors saying some bad lines straight out of a superhero movie. You had two writers clearly breaking the movie into two, writing one half and the latter half. You can see the unevenness especially expressed through Chalamet and Ferguson’s characters. “How big are they? That was insane!”",qd6vqv
hhkj9zo,My take: never before have I seen a movie have that kind of atmosphere in the lobby after the movie. It has the both the visual and audio atmosphere to be an all time epic that could rival Star Wars and lord of the rings. I didn’t love it as an all time great but really enjoy a good slow burn. Solid 8/10,qd6vqv
hhksx17,"I don't know man, but even ignoring how it ended, the movie feels incomplete somehow, as if I had to take several bathroom breaks during the movie and missed important chunks. Can't really explain it differently.

That being said, it's a visual masterpiece.",qd6vqv
hhl1p26,"As a non book reader I absolutley loved it. It just makes me wish Warner Bros had taken a leap of faith and filmed all the required parts back to back then released them yearly, Lord of the Rings style. I can't fathom having to wait an absolute minimum of 3-4 years for the next part.",qd6vqv
hhpm774,"This movie’s greatest strength is its cinematography. Absolutely breathtaking.

It does a better job at adapting the source material than I was expecting, but it still struggles a bit. I don’t blame it, Dune is a really hard story to adapt.

Hans Zimmer’s score was beautifully atmospheric. Not memorable per say, but perfect for the film.

The pacing is where this film struggles a bit. I think the marketing tagline and “part 1” subtitle was put in considering that the film is a bit anticlimactic. It doesn’t really rise to a conclusion nor does the conclusion feel impactful enough.

Also sidenote that isn’t a negative, but I feel like the film should have been R. You can tell Villaneue wanted it to be bloodier with some of the scenes, but the fights felt like bloodless stagefighting.",qd6vqv

hhx7n9p,"So crazy to read so many comments on here saying the film felt too long and dragged. 

The film was so propulsive for me. Villenueve did, I thought, a great job setting the scenes, stakes, and backstory for the first hour or whatever it was until the Harkkonen attack and from there it was a tense, emotional (I'm in the minority, I know) action filled escape from the chasing Harkonnen and Imperium army. 

Kind of blown away to read that it was boring. Would love to know what your guys thoughts are on Blade Runner 2049, if you saw it. Also boring? Maybe his style of story telling just doesn't appeal enough to wide audiences.",qd6vqv
hhlci7w,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhkojei,"Visually it was absolutely stunning and awesome. The score was great too. 

Story wise I found it to be absolutely dull. The characters are shallow at best and uninteresting at worst. And I really don’t find the politics interesting or intriguing at all. I know stuff gets weirder down the line, but I didn’t feel like the movie gave me anything to feel invested it or enticed by other than the hope of more cool visuals (but even then, no new visuals to look forward to were hinted at either other than maybe more of the worms… which were pretty damn cool). One thing that the Lynch film did right was up the weirdness so I really wanted to see what was around the corner. Here not so much, other than feeling like like signs of any actual city existed outside of the noble house (on both planets). I’ll definitely see the second one if it gets made (and I hope it does for all the fans) but once the credits hit I felt like there was absolutely nothing about the story I was looking forward to.",qd6vqv
hhknhyd,"Beautifully shot and directed, but I left feeling that it would have been better served as a mini series/episodic.

Loved the score and weird sounds. The voice sounded so fucking unsettling and cool. 

Pacing seemed just slightly off. Ton to cover and see but still felt rich enough. Overall enjoyed the hell out of seeing something which such scale in theaters after so long. Ready for part 2!",qd6vqv
hhll1vd,"I thought it was a very good movie. 8/10, maybe higher on rewatch. I do agree that it doesn't have the emotional impact of an Arrival or Blade Runner, but I think that's partly the nature of the story. I know how the rest plays out and it's just not that kind of narrative.

I found it really impressive as a work of adaptation. They really put a lot of thought into how to properly convey information in a dynamic and clear way, and how to prevent the audience from feeling overwhelmed. More importantly, I think they gave a lot of thought to the *function* of all kinds of world-building elements, and converted it into a different form. 

I know some people are saying ""I wish this would have been an HBO series."" I don't see it. The structure of the story doesn't lend itself to that. >!It would be incredibly anticlimactic and annoying to wipe out half the cast after 4-5 episodes, for starters.!< Television requires that episodes follow some kind of arc, with beginning, middle, and end. Dune doesn't really allow for that very well, I don't think. Without that you get ""more character development"" but also a mishapen mess.",qd6vqv

hhlt3ww,"I mostly liked this, but I couldn’t help thinking that it would be better as a limited series. More time with these characters would allow the audience to form more of an emotional attachment to them, lending some of the later scenes more weight. If the events of this film took place over five or six hours rather than 2.5, we’d probably have a little more depth and weight and I think the material is there to support that runtime.

That being said, it’s still a good film, just as I would expect from Villeneuve.",qd6vqv

Same with the small group defending the palace. Had the Sardaukar not landed behind them, they might have held off the even larger Harkonnen army.",qd6vqv

Inner dialogs were removed so things were more confusing to the viewer than they should have been almost as if the film was afraid to explain anything the characters were thinking. Some characters got nearly no fleshing out or meaningful interactions so that their deaths had little impact (Yueh). Kynes didn't get to express anything about the Duke saving the spice harvest workers. The Harkonnens didn't seem to be embodied enough on who or what they were so they're not as impactful as they could've been. This is especially apparent when the Harkonnens don't get certain scenes that were meant to give them depth from the book. Gurney, who had been a slave for the Harkonnens, but you'd never guess because they just showed a bull on the wall as a nod instead of mentioning a single atrocity against the Atreides he had witnessed. Too many elements of what makes house harkonnen what it is were forced into subtlety when these are the gladiator lovers that throw Atreides captives into a ring against poisoned weapons. Emperor and the guild of navigators seemed to be absent except for some guild lackeys.

I’m also not much of a film buff either, this was my first Denis film but I feel like I can safely say that this movie is very much carried by its visuals/audio and how grand they feel.

This was the first movie I ever watched in IMAX and it truly was an experience unlike no other, visual and auditory bliss really. But, as many other commenters have mentioned I really do think there are some glaring pacing issues and a major lack of characterization. Perhaps the latter is an issue with the novel itself but as far as pacing goes it really does seem that Dune would be much better as a seasonal television show rather than a two part series of movies. Regardless, I’d give it a solid 8 purely on how fucking gorgeous and grand it felt/looked. Film related technology has come so ridiculously far in the past decade. The atmosphere created in this movie genuinely does feel “other worldly,” the design of damn near everything feels so well done and lends a lot to the film’s great sense of world building.

I also hope this doesn’t come across as if I’m diminishing the plot though. I am very much interested in the lore of this unique world now, it’s just that the characters genuinely could use some more humanizing.

The universe-building is pretty solid and I like the conflict being set up, but the sheer number of flash-forward(?) scenes of him seeing the future take up a significant chunk of the pacing throughout the runtime. Not getting to that point where the future-sight pays off yet kinda leaves me slightly blue-balled until Part 2 hopefully gets released. Acting was solid. Skarsgard and Brolin were the two performances I remember best and that I think stood out the most, but the rest of the cast did their jobs well.

Sound design was great.

Bagpipe guy coming off the ship when they landed was unintentionally hilarious to me.

I would’ve made the movie entirely about the Atreides Harkonnen conflict, and made the film a little shorter, also would’ve made the Harkonnen invasión bigger, more intense and with a lot of spectacle

Still its the film I’ve enjoyed the most this year, there are moments of brilliance in the film, a lot of imagination behind it, seeing the world of Dune being so alive in a big screen really was something to experience",qd6vqv

hiwdspq,"I haven't read the books, but in Villeneuve I trust, so I was on board from the get-go. Ehhhh it was good, I don't regret seeing it or anything, but, overall, it left me pretty cold. For starters, I feel it should have been.. weirder? Everything I've heard about the books painted a more exotic picture in my head, whereas this movie felt relatively """"""grounded"""""" or """"""conventional"""""". Maybe that's just my uninformed expectations, but I thought there was room for more weirdness.


Tone aside, something was missing, story-wise. For instance, the >!doctor betraying Leto!< came out of nowhere. He had like 2 scenes before that, where he acted all cryptic and solemn.. but so did everyone else in the movie, so it didn't come across as any sort of foreshadowing. Then all of a sudden he's >!stabbing Leto in the back, and ""they have my wife!!""!<, and it's all very... meh. We're just finding out she exists as you speak, are we supposed to feel devastated? We don't know her, we barely ""know"" you, until this point you were kind of a background character.. I don't know. Something was definitely missing there.
I also think we didn't get to see much of this ruthless brutality the Harkonnens are apparently known for, and Paul was pretty much a cipher for the majority of the movie, so not a whole lot going on in the way of emotional connections to anything that was happening on screen.

The whole ""Chosen One has visions from the future"" thing is pretty played out by now, so putting that much emphasis on it, with the slo-mo and the repetition.. it could have been handled a bit better, even if only on a visual level to make it not so tedious.


The ending did feel kind of abrupt, but that's par of the course given it's Part 1, and I'm guessing there aren't many points in the book where it would make more sense to split the story in two.


But yeah, it was good enough as a whole, I enjoyed it. Good performances, and it's impeccable on a technical level, as expected. I never felt BORED, never felt lost, and the details that are left unexplained (bizarre spider pet?? Some kind of ""computer"" people who roll back their eyes while they.. compute?) are frankly more interesting left like that. But still, the overall feeling is of light disappointed, even if I wasn't invested in the universe prior to the movie.

However, if I hadn't read the book I'd be completely lost. There is so much to Dune the audience needs to understand and yet the movie explained almost nothing. I am very surprised to see the movie got such high ratings.

Dune should be made into a series, not movies. It has so much information and needs time to explain the significance of things.",qd6vqv
hnedgcr,"Good first half, meandering second half - if I were them I'd have restored their deleted content in the first half to help flesh out the characters better and instead reduced the scenes in the second half to help with pacing.

IMO the film should have ended just after the last sandworm scene and zendaya/Chani's first appearance, it really drags when it decides to keep going and it's an odd place to decide to end this first part

A couple of other notes,

\- the tent scene where he has a meltdown is ruined by whispering and poor sound mix, not only can you not hear clearly what they’re saying but the visions don’t line up with his massive panic about what’s going to happen (needed some actually bad visions in order to make sense)

\- the earlier whispered discussion between Paul and his mum about his birth is also poorly sound mixed and too much of an info dump

Solid first part though, hope they work on better pacing in the second part as that's always been the weak point in Denis Villeneuve's filmography",qd6vqv

But as of now- not a bad movie, not particularly great one either.",qd6vqv
hhkrhqf,"I give this movie a 7.

For a movie with a runtime of 2 hr and 35, I felt like it was too long, and at the same time wasn't enough. That it gives you a ton of information and the at the same time doesnt.

Particularly the eradication of House Atreides. I never felt attached to the House outside of Leto, Paul, and Jessica. That house never felt any character. Compare that to House Stark when they were brutally murdered during the Red Wedding. 

Leto and Jessica could've been more as well, I wanted to see more of their relationship, Leto as a leader and Jessica as a member of the Bene Gesserit. Things that were left out was Leto's dinner scene that shows his governing style, Jessica's interrogation of Thurfir due to the traitor being warned by the Mapes, and Leto thinking of Jessica and Paul right before his death.

I felt like the screen time was hogged by Paul and his dreams of Chani. Charismatic characters like Beast Rabban, Duncan Idaho, and Gurney Halleck felt really shallow despite having the most interesting personalities. 

Piter actually has more depth as the Baron's mentat and not just a lowly servant. He's cunning as well and had a depth in personality that we don't get to see. He has his ambitions, the Baron knows this, Piter knows this and this is how you move upward in the Harkonnen culture. 

Beast Rabban barely does anything in the destruction of House Atridies, he just beheads nameless soldiers in the dark. I think his screen time was less than 5 minutes. 

House Harkonnen was barely shown as well. Giedi Prime was supposed to be a planet of Industry. It's kinda like showing Isengard but only the Tower of Orthanc and Saruman's throne room. Baron Harkonnen was frightfully terrifying and wanted to see him more. 

Also shit was fucking dark, Arakkis had two moons but couldn't reflect enough light to know what I'm seeing. I was just seeing shadows. When the Baron said that 'House Atreides will die in the dark' I didn't think he meant it literally.

While the structures and buildings of Arakeen was great. It felt empty. Arakeen were supposed to have Fremen, smugglers, and other noble houses. Theres a reason why the Sardakaur was supposed to be disguised as Harkonnen soldiers in the book. Like the implication of destroying a House has no consequences. It just felt like no one was there.

They spend a lot of the movie talking about the Fremen but they're shown in the last 15 mins of the film. 

The ending felt like an obstacle that's going into plot 2. It wasn't necessarily the climax of Dune which is why the ending felt abrupt. 

I initially wanted to give this movie like a 9 but then I saw the original 1984 film and went on a deep dive of the lore and saw that all the good shit happens, the better characters appear and the real climax happens in the 2nd part of this movie. 

I think fans of Dune will like this movie a lot but I'm not so sure about your casual moviegoers. I'm assuming they expected a full story but didn't get one leaving the theatres confused and unfulfilled.",qd6vqv

Pretty much the whole film was just dull and uninteresting. Visually it's fine although not amazing, and Hans Zimmer's score is technically not bad, although it gets a bit bombastic and repetitive for me.

The characters are very bland and nothing special. Unless you have to read the book to get it, I simply have no idea what I was supposed to be rooting for or care about. Shooting scenes in a desert for a good amount of the runtime just didn't impress me much here. The film has no satisfying ending and yeah there's just nothing memorable.

Paul realizes that Jamis is watching his eyes and allows his hair to obscure his vision, knowing that Jamis now can't look at his eyes. The look on Jamis's face is incredible when he sees Paul use this tactic. Like he knows then and there that Paul is ultra aware of his surroundings and he likely will die to Paul.

It was clear that the actors were really doing their best but still struggling with some of the lines. The story felt so disjointed and like it had no cohesion. That battle with Jamis at the end fell completely flat. No buildup, no emotional resolution, nothing. It just happened and then the movie ended. It felt like a filler episode ending fight. When the credits rolled, I felt absolutely nothing. Maybe excitement for some sandworm-riding, but that's about it. 

I'm so conflicted because I loved the world, the sets, the costumes, and pretty much anything visual, but just about everything else felt rushed and broken.

I think a lot of fans of the book are going into this ready to love it no matter what hence all these people calling it a Sci-Fi masterpiece.

After the movie let out, we were all just kind of calm. We all agree that it looked great, had a great cast, was able to give representation to things we could only imagine for decades.

But it didn't hit hard for us. I looked over at my buddy during the Thopter in the sandstorm scene and we kind of just exchanged a look. There just wasn't any build up or tension in the movie. I think the soundtrack was to blame. I didn't believe my buddy after the film when he said that it was Hans Zimmer. None of us could hum or recall the ""Dune theme"".

In each of these scenes the actors also don't seem to make eye contact with each other, and seem as they're speaking to the air rather than to another person. 

Were these scenes in fact filmed with each actor separately, perhaps because of Covid concerns? The only other explanation I can come up with for how dumb those scenes looked and felt is much less complimentary to the director.

It felt like everybody in the film knew about the prophecy and we were just walking through the story. At the start of the film I kept thinking about how much more interesting it would have been if certain scenes had been the first scene to create some tension, instead of this overwhelming feeling of being on a Dune dark ride.

The larger focus on the treatment of the Fremen was interesting but even then I just kept thinking too much of this film is people talking slowly while standing in rooms that feel slightly too large while the OST just goes a bit ham without really going anywhere.

The Lynch version was crazy and deviated in some weird ways from the book, but I felt its emotional core was far stronger by having more weird characters. I felt this film just played it safe for almost every single scene, except the weird spider thing which was the rare moment where the film did anything vaguely unexpected.

Its a stylistic choice and one I get. Its just not a style that I find very interesting to watch.",qd6vqv
hhqrpnw,"
This was the fastest 2.5 hour movie I’ve ever seen. As someone who’s read the book multiple times I feel like it was a very good depiction, especially visually, but does fall short of being great. 

I wish they would have gone full LOTR. Do a 3+ hour version of this film and I think it’s probably perfect. That may sound like a lot but there’s only a few pivotal points missing from the book that could add a lot depth and intrigue to the film. 

I think just adding the betrayal sub plot may have been all this movie needed. That really highlights the political schemes within schemes that are prevalent in this world. The Duke faking that he suspects his wife as the unknown betrayer so that the Harkonnens believe they’ve divided the house from within also leads directly into the dinner party which gives Kynes much more room to flex and show just how important a character he/she is. While maybe most importantly, planting seeds to why Kynes would actually risk their life to help them. 

But it also would give Thufir Hawat is time to shine when Jessica confronts him as the betrayer  and showcase what mentats actually are.

I truly wish they would have made a series out of it rather than movies. Something similar to GoT and even the first season could have ended exactly where the movie did but it would have allowed for a lot more of the world and lore to actually be fleshed out and better understood.

I’m not familiar with the source material, are Timothee and Zendaya’s characters meant to be the main protagonists of the series ?

hhkimoi,"Really excited for the sequel 2 U N E. 

Okay, real talk, I don't know shit about Dune. So that's where this is coming from. This was my introduction to anything Dune because once it was announced I figured it might as well be. 

I thought this was a solid movie. Obviously the cast is out of this world ;) and all putting in solid performances. Rebecca Ferguson was probably the standout to me as the character who generally had the most range of emotion. I still think Mamoa is a little stiff when asked to do anything other than fight or smile devilishly but that's most of what his role called for so applause all around. 

As someone who knows basically nothing about Dune, I feel like I was able to follow along just fine. Visually it was pretty stunning as I'm sure no one doubted it would be. The music was incredible and very unique, really adding to the overall tone and huge set pieces. 

I think my main issue would boil down to the pace of it. This is definitely the first half of any full story. Almost nothing is resolved in this and without a sequel to do it justice, this wouldn't stand up on its own. I believe a sequel is coming, and I believe they've set up something really good. But as it stands right now, it is certainly only half finished. 

This movie *almost* felt rushed. As in it didn't, but compared to BR2049 a lot of the massive set pieces feel like they aren't given the time they were in that. The obvious difference is that a lot of BR2049 is in the subtext while this movie is more plot driven and surface level, so you have more to chew on while the shots take their time in BR2049. But still, I felt like an extra 20min or so just dedicated to the huge moments, the action sequences, and the establishing shots would have made this feel that much more epic. 

Overall, if this gets the sequel it deserves, I could see it going down as an incredible double feature. So far the sets are amazing, the performances and casting are great, and the action is cool. I'd give this a 7/10 right now but if they bring this thing home right I could see it going up.",qd6vqv

hhlgjoj,"I think apart from Arrival, Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi movies just don't really do it for me, especially compared to his more grounded stuff, like Prisoners and Sicario. The visuals in this were nice, as I'd come to expect from him, but they don't quite reach the highs of the visuals in Blade Runner 2049 (to be fair, it's very difficult/damn near impossible to compete against Roger Deakins). But even in BR2049, I found myself just not able to get into the story and characters. So Denis basically makes beautiful looking sci-fi movies that I just don't really care about. 

This story seems like something that would work better as a tv series ala Game of Thrones, where you actually have time to get to know the characters and invest in them. I really didn't find myself invested in anyone in this story, and it felt like most of the movie was just exposition against some really nice visuals. 

I really don't understand what Hollywood sees in Timothee Chalamet. Sure, maybe it's just me, but I feel like the dude is just so boring to watch in everything I see him in, is constantly out shined by the other actors around him (even Jason fucking Mamoa was more interesting to watch), and he always has this expression like he's either on the verge of falling asleep or just waking up from a long nap. So this movie already had a giant hurdle to get me to care about his character, and unfortunately it just doesn't rise to the occasion.

EDIT: Also, I'm coming into this movie as a non-reader, and I've never seen the David Lynch Dune, so I'm pretty much going into this blind except for little crumbs of plot points that I've picked up here and there. I think the movie does an ok job at setting up the world, even if some of the exposition is clunky (the main character literally watches little documentaries that explain aspects of the world). The overall plot doesn't seem too complicated, although I found a lot of the prophecy stuff and the visions/dreams/whatever to be somewhat confusing in terms of what exactly they want me to take away from that stuff. It also definitely feels like this movie doesn't stand on its own at all and basically necessitates a part 2 to wrap up the story. Obviously, that's how they decided to set it up, but it doesn't really feel like this movie has a complete narrative on its own, which I think every movie (even those that are part of a series) should have at the very least. This didn't really feel like a movie so much as one very long 1st episode (or first couple of episodes) of a high budget tv show.",qd6vqv
hhu0hbt,Oscar Isaac was phenomenal.  The death of the Duke must have been inspired by Caravaggio or paintings of the baroque in general.  The scenography was far and beyond what I hoped for.,qd6vqv
hhw2pcr,Really enjoyed the pace of this movie. The storyline felt more like rolling waves rather than the build-up to one big fight scene that we've become accustomed to in sci-fi lately under Disney's reign. Consistent hits of wow factor throughout.,qd6vqv
hhlv78i,"For me the end was really disappointing and the movie ended before it even started properly. Nice as intro, pretty bad as standalone movie.",qd6vqv
hhkqng0,I bow at the alter of Hans Zimmer,qd6vqv
hhkrhoo,I really really like Dune universe. The book is amazing and I love the David Lynch movie as cheesy as it is. I really felt like movie was missing something. It felt weird no narration by Princess irulan no guild navigators felt like they kinda rushed into the fighting no real development of them on Arrakis maybe. Something was off.,qd6vqv
hhkvkzh,"I think this movie is possibly a win for the  book fans, judging by your reactions.

However, for the non-book fans, it maybe really, how should I say this... difficult to follow?

Did anyone else also find it difficult to follow, besides me?

Don't get me wrong. This ISN'T an anti-Dune post, and you need to defend it at all. I do think this is a quality movie, just wished I understood everything lol.",qd6vqv
hhkwyhf,"Too bad about the Sardaukar. They were built up to be these elite badasses, but then Duncan Idaho went full Boromir on them.",qd6vqv
hhldgau,This movie maybe a love letter to Dune fans but pretty much inaccessible to a regular viewer. Some of the plot points didn’t make any sense. The ending was so underwhelming. I was disappointed to see director's style overshadowed the substance.,qd6vqv
hhodiwe,"This movie looked and sounded amazing. The characters were spot on except Jason Mamoa was horribly miscast. I think this was the best a modern Dune movie could realistically be.

Having said that...

This movie could have been 4 hours long and it still would have felt rushed and somewhat shallow.  I like it and I'll recommend it, but it doesn't give depth to what's really going on underneath the surface.  Nothing has a chance to breath.  For example: they introduce Dr. Yueh, he has like one or two short additional scenes, and then he's a traitor.  It's so quick there's no impact to it.

I may not be a good person to criticize this movie since I love the books.  I know there's a world beneath the surface of each of these characters.  This movie really changed my mind and made me think that Dune can't really be a great movie unless it were like a 6 parter.

I think this would have been a fantastic series, but it's just too short as a movie.",qd6vqv
hhoxssd,"I went into this movie absolutely cold. I’ve never seen the old movie or show or read the book. The first and second trailers didn’t hook me, Didnt think it looked good at all and was planning on not watching it. But it wasn’t till they released the third trailer thats def made me excited made it look cool and gave me a general idea of what the movie was gonna be. And i just finished watching the movie and… HOLY SHIT! That was so freaking cool! Loved everything about the movie and it wasn’t boring at all only negative thing i’d say about the film is that it does kinda drag a bit after they change into the suits and paul and jessica start walking the dessert and find the ferman and stuff. Fav scene is the one in the plane where paul used the voice and jessica  used her voice to kill everyone on it so cool love this movie hope we get a part two. Also i did watch this in IMAX so awesome",qd6vqv
hhp82dn,"By the time the movie was over I appreciated George Lucas and Star Wars a lot less. Never read the books and wanted to wait til after seeing the film to start, but I did know that Lucas took a lot from Dune. To that extent I definitely wasn't expecting. There will for sure be idiots out there claiming this is the biggest SW knockoff ever.",qd6vqv
hhph08z,"First thing I hear upon exiting the theater was ""I knew it was going to be a Star Wars rip off""",qd6vqv
hhppi1o,"I think I’m kind of over movies and this really hammered that home. 

Series just have so much more power and are more dynamic than dumping so many resources into a film.

Really excited to see the sequel, really bummed I don’t get a few more episodes over the next month to learn more about the lore and flesh out some storylines. 

There’s just so much meat left on this bone right now for a newcomer, I want to learn so much more!",qd6vqv
hhrh4b2,Fuck the movie is about to begin and im surrounded with a bunch of cickling teenagers,qd6vqv
hhs1smn,"I thought it was a very well made movie but wasn't my cup of tea.   
  
Visions during a lot scenes just take you out of what's going on. No real set up for the characters...why should I care about them? No mention of the prophecy so again, why do I care?   
  
It seems like the sort of saga that's best suited for a book where you can absorb the world and build to the climax.",qd6vqv
hhs9m74,"Personally, I just couldn't get myself to care about any of the characters. 

Maybe I'd feel differently if I read the books? I dunno. The dialogue oftentimes seemed melodramatic and stilted; there were few actual human interactions; fundamentally, I just couldn't relate to any of the characters on the screen.

Towards the end, I honestly got bored -- not because of the slow pacing -- but because I just couldn't connect with anybody.

It's not a bad film in the slightest. As everybody says, it *is* gorgeous. But the hype left me wanting more",qd6vqv
hhsf7j4,"Sigh, well it was beautiful and had amazing production, but the story was not that engaging. It felt really rushed so I had no investment in what was happening, all that just to tell me the story is just beginning.",qd6vqv
hhsv3zv,"It's a beautiful film, the soundtrack is fantastic, the worldbuilding is meticulous and based on what my friends who loved the book have said it does justice to the source material. I didn't really enjoy it though - the characters left me cold, the bombastic sound effects got tiring after a while, and it felt like the incredible cinematography was papering over some of the cracks to the point I got tired of the vistas and slow-mo. It was dull: not in the sense that nothing happened because obviously a lot happens, especially once the base is destroyed, but more because the plot and characters never drew me in and without that it's just a succession of sweeping shots and loud noises

Ultimately I'm delighted that fans of the book are getting the film they've been waiting for and that general audiences seem to be responding positively but it did nothing for me and I probably won't see the sequels, which are almost undoubtedly going to happen",qd6vqv
hht1m8s,"Plenty of mixed reviews on here from what I’ve seen. I honestly loved this movie, as someone who has never read the books or seen the 1984 adaptation. Visually stunning in the theater, the score was utterly amazing too. One nitpick I agree with is that there were a couple times where the dialogue is hard to hear.

I could see how some people found it slow and boring but to me the 2.5 hours felt short and I really wanted it to keep going lol. Overall not perfect but pretty easily my favorite movie of the year so far. 9/10 for me, really hope the sequel gets made.",qd6vqv
hht7zt3,"Wildly split opinions. I personally loved it. It’s quite other worldly, with only 1 character (Duncan Idaho) being the relatable one. I think given the theme of this being on an alien planet (and Paul being a messianic figure), it works. But that won’t resonate with some audience members.

I thought it moved at a clipping speed. From the Harkonnen attack onwards, the movie never stays in one place more than 15 minutes. I don’t quite understand the people who are saying they were bored the entire time. I knew going in this was Part 1 of (hopefully) 2, so with that, there’s a lot of world building and stakes to be established.",qd6vqv
hhvxrmj,"The crysknife scene with Shadout Mapes sheathing the knife without bloodying it first, was a mistake, right?",qd6vqv
hhw6dnw,"Anyone else feel underwhelmed by the soundtrack? Seems like most folks loved it.

For the most part, it felt very bland to me, almost like the background music you'd hear in a trailer. Mostly just an incohesive collection of broad, roaring chords and various eerie instruments. Very little that was memorable at all imo.

The few bits that did stand out did so for the wrong reasons (e.g., the \~20 second queue of bagpipes that came out of nowhere as Gurney charged into battle -- completely out of character with the music of the rest of the battle sequence)

If people found joy in it, I suppose I'm happy for them, but I just don't hear it",qd6vqv
hhx0shh,"This movie is brilliant and gorgeous, but part 2 will be the true test of whether the filmakers get the point of the book, the way SO many people dont.

The final section of the book is when you realize you've been reading >!a villain origin story the whole time.!<",qd6vqv
hi4sbky,"Kind of feels like most of this movie is ""hey look at all these cool shots we have""",qd6vqv
hi56ytv,Dune got green lit the sequel,qd6vqv
hiccf5d,"Did anybody else think the epic middle eastern singing/cry that kicked in when something important happened was overused and became a gimmick by the 4th or 5th time? I'm seeing a lot of comments praising the sound design but to me Dune felt a lot like Tenet in the way dialogue was overpowered by other sounds.
Desert power was cringy and so was the acting at times. Didn't feel any connection to the characters at all. Jessica in particular came across as pretentious, but maybe that's just a Bene Gesserit thing, who knows.",qd6vqv
hioryta,"How is it that after an attack on his son, House Atreides was so unprepared that a doctor was able to bring down the entire defence system? Imagine any modern defence network, now ask yourself if the Monarch’s doctor could take the system down, not possible. Why not simply have House Harkonnen overwhelm them along with the Emperor’s army? Very odd writing.",qd6vqv
hj636b9,"As a long-time reader, and quite a fan of Denis' movies--this still exceeded expectations.

I find it hard to believe you could do a better adaptation of the first half of book one.  Especially without resorting to voiceovers to get all the exposition and inner thought in.      Yes there were things left out but the only way to put everything in would be a miniseries (or series even) and then you'd have people complaining that it's ""boring"" (heck to some people this condensed movie is too slow.)

There's so much internal thought stuff happening in the book series (plans within plans) that add complexity and depth to the plot that it's a tough order to film the story.  But this did such a great job of it, IMO of course.

Unlike with Lord of the Rings, there wasn't any extra crap thrown in.  I enjoyed LOTR and PJ got a LOT right--but please with such a long story we don't need your additional things to ""make it better"".  And of course don't get me started on the Hobbit movies...",qd6vqv
hjrqnj2,Why is this movie so well regarded. It was boring and went no where with its slow pacing.,qd6vqv
hszv9ox,"Watched it for a second time. A big fan of the books and of Denis, so I knew this couldn't fail. My thoughts:

-Villeneuve can do no wrong. I knew this wouldn't be as cerebral as his other films, but it's it's good to see such a masterful director at the height of his powers, with a budget and cast to match in a mainstream film. His attention to detail and little flourishes really are special

-all of those establishing shots and generous special effects to build the world are just sumptuous. I loved it even more the 2nd time around

-Zimmer's score was great of course. He's so influential by this point that it must be hard for him not to imitate himself,  but it was perfect. Really set the tone 

-i think the biggest credit I can give the movie is that it really FELT like these characters were leaders of the universe, and not just actors speaking with gravitas on a set. There was enough pomp and ceremony to really sell how important these characters (and their actions) are, and I'm really excited to see this go further in Pt 2 with Paul's ascension

-That Sarduakar introduction was fucking epic, and gave a faceless enemy some actual character and backstory in a simple way. We never actually saw them win a fight though

-The Gom Jabbar scene was perfect. Jessica's trepidation really showed how much danger Paul was in, and the Mother's subtle change when Paul's visions began was very well done.

-The Baron was so great, and I love that they pulled off his appearance. Everything about that dinner scene was awesome, and it was a great way of showing us how clever and resourceful he is instead of telling us.

-the fight choreography was surprisingly good. Even seeing little Paul kicking ass was believable

-I actually thought that the movie split at a good time. Having Paul start his journey with the Fremen at the end is a good resolution",qd6vqv
hhko125,"I though it was awesome. As a big fan of the first book, I thought they did it justice. Great visuals, performances, and music. But we need part 2 man. We need it. So much wild stuff happens in part 2. I hope to god this film is successful and WB goes through with making part 2.",qd6vqv
hhkqtkw,"Why did Jessica look at Paul's back like that in the desert when they were getting dressed?

They land after the storm, decide to change. He of course turns around to give her and himself privacy and she turns around to look at him. He has his shirt of at this point and it is a very pointed long look.",qd6vqv
hhkxhve,I thought it was about to end like six different times,qd6vqv
hhl0afp,"The set design in the movie was truly stunning. I loved the designs of all the ships in the movie, they looked so cool. The major battle was breathtaking, only Denis Villeneuve could capture it so perfectly. This movie deserves to be seen in Imax.",qd6vqv
hhl0wqu,"I loved it and never read the book but know most of the details. Amazing score, cinematography, acting, and story. I didn’t want it to end. I pray we get a Part 2. Easily a 9.5/10 for me.",qd6vqv

*Dune: Part One title card appears*

> Wait what

*Chani appears in person*

> Finally! There she is

*Chani says, this is only just the beginning*

> Wait is it over?

*Directed by Denis Villeneuve*

> Wait it's over?

A good experience, but it's still very much half a story. I like that it's taking its time though. Inshallah Part 2 in 2023.",qd6vqv
hhl8nkw,"this must be the fastest 2.5 hour movie I've ever watched.  feels like a lot has happened but at the same time, not a lot.  Looking forward to the eventual part 2 already.  loved every bit of the ambiance of the movie and going to shoot on-set instead of green screening it was a good decision.",qd6vqv
hhl8vx6,"I'm of the opinion that Dune is an extraordinarily difficult-to-adapt property, but I think Villeneuve nailed it tonally. It's still going to be kind of confusing for general audiences, there's just no way around that, but I liked this approach a lot better than the Lynch Dune approach of every character just internal monologuing to explicitly state their motivations every time lmao. 

And visually, this was of course fantastic. I loved the sense of real weight behind the worms, the shifting sand/sinkhole effect is so ominous and menacing. 

Casting was perfect imo. Solid 4/5 stars!",qd6vqv
hhlb6a2,Dune was simply amazing. I think my favorite part was how every aspect of this film felt like it was a lived in world. Loved it,qd6vqv
hhlbfv7,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhlbn0o,"just finished it. enjoyed the heck out of it. the vocal mix sucked. reminded me of tenet. cinematography was fucking amazing. jason momoa just keeps hitting home runs. dude can do no wrong. rest of the cast was solid. i haven't read the book since i was a kid but i do remember the previous dune movies tv shows. 

hopefully they will do part 2 but who knows. the way they ended it certainly leads up to the idea that there are going to be multiple parts after this 1st one but i feel like for that to happen maybe wb needs to take a leap of faith line like new line cinema did with the lord of the rings movies. 

i can't lie i was bummed them killing off a certain lead. i wish the movie was even longer lol. but i figure if they made a 3 hour movie a lot of us at the end would have said man wish it was another hour lol. 

i really hope wb gives denis the go ahead to do part 2 & 3 and gives him enough money to film them back to back and just enough money in general to where he doesn't have to feel guilty about holding off on other projects he is looking to do because of the time commitment. 

i mean timothy c is young so he can probably give up 8 months of his time to film. i think with the left over actors now playing the major roles you can possibly sign them on for a long commitment. 

but it all depends i guess. i feel like they will ok part 2 and by the time it is released things hopefully will be back to pre covid times and that would be a true test of box office numbers for them to say ok you can make part 3 or they may just say hey man you can make part 2 but wrap it all up in part 2. 

either ways we probably wont see part 2 till probably 23-24 maybe 25?? will people besides us care??",qd6vqv
hhlbvvc,"Saw this tonight in theaters on an upgraded screen (not imax but really nice). Have never read the books and knew virtually nothing going in.

What an absolutely amazing film. As others have said, the world building was just top notch. From the ships to costumes to sets, everything felt in place.

Visually it was fantastic, the cgi was some of the best I’ve seen. Acting from most everybody was very good as well with some excellent performances from Skarsgard, the mom and Timothy especially.

The sound was truly impressive and felt super powerful in theaters. I could have used subtitles a little more as the bass really drowned out some of the vocals at points.

Can’t wait to rewatch again.",qd6vqv
hhlc74t,"As a person who has never read the books, do you folks who have read think it's possible to fit the rest of the story in a second movie? I feel like there so much story left and I don't even know what happens!",qd6vqv
hhlcfcg,it was sick. that is all.,qd6vqv
hhljk45,"Honestly I think Villeneuve should have pitched a 5 hour movie with an intermission. This movie had such an amazing look, sound, feel, and pace. The only thing that was missing is the rest of it. The sequel isn't even in production yet, and the story of this movie cannot stand on its own without the resolution the next one must bring. It would have benefitted greatly from being filmed concurrently, like Peter Jackson did with LotR. Instead we have to wait another two years for a sequel, that is completely necessary, because studio execs were too scared to green light two movies at once. It bugs me that they would even think of the possibility of not endorsing a sequel, because if there isn't one then why make the first movie to begin with?",qd6vqv
hhlkh15,"Watched it in september and loved it. But rewatching at home I noticed some flaws.
1. No explanation in why they use blades with all their technology. I know using lasers can cause nuclear explosion, but they still have those guns with slow bullets. Why not use them? And it's not like they are afraid to use lasers anyway, trying to laser Duncan' shielded ship.
2. There was  a moment when soldiers tell Leto that the Sun is up so they should come inside. And later we see Paul just walking outside, talking with the guy who looked after the trees. I did not feel the whole danger of Arrakis' conditions.
3. Paul was the only one who decided to push trousers in boots? Isn't that common sense? To hide your skin from the sun?
I loved the movie anyway, but felt bad for details inconsistency. BR2049 still Dennis' best work.",qd6vqv

Otherwise, I loved every second of it, it really does help to have read the book first otherwise you'll be left scratching your head about certain characters who were only in the movie for like 45 minutes.

hhohz0v,"Okay. Thoughts on the movie, since it's had a chance to percolate some more over 12 hours. Random observations, thoughts, etc. incoming. 

1) Chalamet is TALL AF. Even though he's supposed to be a teenager/young man in this film, he towers over everyone else in all of his scenes. Nothing really pertinent to the story. But I did think it lent some gravitas to his role

2) Javier Bardem was unrecognizable. I didn't look at the actor list or watch any spoilers beyond the very first, so I didn't know who the actors would be. And until I opened the list in this thread, I couldn't tell for sure who Stilgar or the Baron were. 

3) Once again, I LOVED the aesthetic of this movie. That first shot as they flew over and into Arrakeen was beautiful. The architecture was just so *alien*, and unrecognizable. A vast difference from the more recognizable features on Caladan

4) Hope the Baron has a larger role in the second part. It was a 2.5 movie, and outside of the scene with Leto I didn't feel as if he had much of a presence in the film. Despite the fact that he's one of the driving characters in the series. 

5) I love the fact that they didn't dilute the movie to make it more appealing to a broader audience. Probably helps that the novel has been out since the 60s, and that this is the third or fourth movie adaptation. But there were still people who have never read the book or seen a prior film, and they dove into it as coldly as someone reading the book for the first time would",qd6vqv

I'm reading through the comments here I recognize what they are and then I was just like oh s*** those are f****** Las guns!!

I think when I read the books I never really understood what they could do, how terrible they actually were.

Movie was amazing at showing the scale and power of everything. The terrible destructive power of a lot of the weapons and the people.
Loved it!",qd6vqv
hhoxkio,"I am a little surprised how little they explained things like the bene gesserit, mentats, and the spacing guild.

All of these things are important to why Paul is unique and what it means to be the kwisatz haderach.

Also, I feel like the motivation for the emperor to betray the Atreides was not clear enough.

The first half was a slow burner introducing us to the world and then it got bullet paced in the second half. The worldbuilding is very intricate and finale left me wanting for more.

Story wise, I was a little let down.  I know there is a lot of narrative pipe and exposition (and I appreciated the show/don't tell aspects of a lot of it), but I was never really invested in Paul or his family.  Since this is part 1 of supposedly 2 than I guess Paul's journey will seem more complete if we get that second film.  If we had gotten a little more time with Isaac and Mamoa I think their sacrifices would have had a bit more weight.  I am curious if book readers wanted more time with those two.

I read the book a long time ago and don't remember a lot of it but I thought they did an excellent job with a very hard to adapt source material. My wife loved it as well and she's never read the book, and nor is she really a big fantasy/sf fan. She said it reminded her of old-school Hollywood epics like Lawrence of Arabia.

It was quite an experience on IMAX. Everything just looked so...*massive*. The sense of scale is really well done, and the production design really gives the whole thing a truly alien feeling. It's just a really transportive, immersive movie that whisks you away to another world.

My biggest complaint about the movie is that it does feel like a prologue. It ends just as it feels like things are *really* starting to heat up. I understand why though as the book didn't really half a true halfway point where the story turns. 

Another thing would be that some of the dialogue can be a little hard to hear. The movie falls into the annoying tendency of major blockbusters these days where everyone speaks in low whispery tones. It doesn't help that Hans Zimmer's score is actively trying to destroy your eardrums lol

But these are minor nitpicks as I loved it for the most part.",qd6vqv

I am only a book 1 reader, and the first watch in IMAX I was so focused on what they added or took away from the books. I was going through a mental checklist while the movie was playing, so I wasn't immersing myself as much with the movie. 

But last night, on my 4K TV with a modest sound setup, it was fantastic. I knew what to expect, and it allowed me to enjoy the scenes more. I rated Dune 7.5/10 last weekend, but now it is an 8.5/10. If the story concludes in the sequel, I could see it moving up to 9/10.

Denis knows the trick to world-building that seems to elude basically every other super/galactic/monster director in the game: give us the giant, grandiose, DUNE-your-friccin-brain-out mega-scope we crave, and show us the pulsing, breathing, intimate patchwork detail we need, and our minds can shade in the rest.

A bit of history would be good about the Butlerian Jihad would've been useful to explain about why there aren't any computers in this age and therefore the importance of mentats etc.

Personally....I'm in the later group. I wanted to love this film, but I just couldn't connect to it in the second half (the first half -- which was much more devoted to world building -- was much more interesting imo).

**The good:** Yes, it is gorgeous. The scene where they evacuate the mining crew -- where the film just perfectly captures the scale of the sandworms -- left me in awe. Beyond that, the world building is impressively done.

**The, erm, less good:** Fundamentally, I just could not connect to the characters. It felt like so little time was spent developing them -- the deaths of characters like Liet-Kynes and Jamis simply did not emotionally register, because we barely got to know them. More generally, dialogue felt stilted, melodramatic, and there were exceedingly few true human connections. Ultimately, Duncan Idaho was really the only character who felt like a real person.

Similarly, the plot in the second half started to drag. Stuff just kind of *happened*, with very little development or natural flow. In my view, the dream sequences were also too frequent and interrupted the flow of the story.

I don't mean to be too negative; there's lots that's great about this film. I also have not read the books, so perhaps the colors my perceptions. But I just fundamentally could not connect.",qd6vqv

I have no personal connection with its devotion to the source material. but based on how cool, unique and beautiful it was, I get the hype. I just think as a story, it felt very choppy, and I wished I could have had some more dialogue to help me understand Paul better. His connections with these people were very understood, but so much time was spent on his visions, I never really got a grasp on the person having them. I wish he and his mother spoke more traveling so I could understand where their heads were at. 


I’m reserving true judgement until I see the whole picture. But so so so much of this almost 3 hour movie seemed like set up for something that seems like it has so much to cover it should be even longer, so while I didn’t love it, I won’t say it was bad. I need to see that first.",qd6vqv

hhopdzf,"I was hyped to see the next ""star wars"", then I ended up leaving the movie early. It looked good, sounded good, but the plot wasn't there, the scenes don't flow or connect, there's no progression or emotional payoff. Way too many slow mo shots of big ships. The first half is slow and the character development is missing. I'm sure it's likely a just book-to-movie lost in translation issue but as someone who never read the book, I came out of that movie thirsty for a better story.

The whole female secret order and messiah thing was crammed in. Paul's frequent visions/dreams were just confusing road bumps that are pretty much all setup for part 2 at the cost of part 1. The voice thing feels like a huge asspull. Atreides security is garbage. Can't protect the son or the duke. The whole Doctor betrayal thing felt out of place. Doctor is a side character and basically fucks over the entire house just to get his throat cut. The Duke's death and the poison plot was straightforward, pointless and void of emotion. They took out 2 of the biggest characters for no reason.

The big battle was just a bunch of Atreides ships exploding. No real combat, no sci fi ships shooting, no counter attack, no defense or preparations. There was so much potential there, wasted. Duncan's last stand was largely wasted as well. The set up for that fight was terrible. The imperial soliders land, get ambushed (by who?), we don't even see what happens. Then Duncan gets taken out by nobodies while Paul wastes time pounding the door. Duncan should've fought the main Harkonnen enforcer and his death should've been more impactful. Why is Marvel the only studio that can make movies now?

The biggest problem is that the main character and protagonists don't drive the story. They are passive. They show up to Arrakis, and they try to harvest spice, they do as they're told. We spend so much time just observing them. They frequently don't have an objective, hence the lack of progression. The villains are the ones driving any kind of plot. All the good guys do is try to survive, or just die. They don't take the initiative, we see no creativity or planning from them.",qd6vqv

Small details like the Old Duke’s portrait and the mounted bull head of the beast that bested him in combat were nice nods. This just shows that Dune is in the right hands. Also thought his portrayal of the voice and Mentats were really cool. 

The scene when the Bene Gesserit are coming to visit Paul early on, shrouded in dark save for the light from the ship behind their procession, the soundtrack interspersed with rain drops hitting the ground, was fucking gorgeous. 

I pray we get part 2 or more. 

“A beginning is a very delicate time.”",qd6vqv
hhlgvlq,"Thought it was pretty messy honestly, so much character development miasing from the book which is understandable but really hurts the film. I honestly cant say i would like this and i hadnt read the book and filled in the blanks myself.",qd6vqv
hhkyawa,"It genuinely felt like I watched a beautiful film of a wikipedia synopsis. All the plot beats are there but it took none of the time to add all the details and small character beats for me to get that invested or emotionally connected to anything that was happening. It felt like so much was crammed in here even though it was only half of one book (that’s not even that long of a book). Really weird.

I love Denis’ other work but this was a huge miss for me. I felt almost nothing during the whole experience other than being impressed at the craft/scale.",qd6vqv
hhl39rq,"God, I know everyone here is praising this movie and basically treating it like the second coming, but as a casual moviegoer totally unfamiliar with the books this movie lost me about an hour and a half into it, around the time the attacks take place. The scale of this movie is cyclopean, but part of the problem with that is that after a certain point I just stopped caring. It felt like watching a (very beautiful) Wikipedia summary. I kind of felt like everybody who wasn't Rebecca Ferguson or Jason Momoa was phoning it in. Don't get me wrong-- this movie is gorgeous, but it was so exhausting that during the last half-hour I kept praying for it to end. I don't know if I would care enough to see a sequel, tbh.",qd6vqv
hhtdy82,"Easily the most overhyped, overrated film of this year.

It was like a 4/10 syfy channel movie, with 10/10 art. Also, whose genius idea was it to cast Edward Scissorhand's angsty, bastard son as the main character?",qd6vqv
hhkkfih,"It goes to show how hard Dune is to adapt to cinema when one of my gripes about a 2 and a half hour movie is not enough time to breathe. 

The format of film limited the characterization of important side characters a bit too much. Namely: Yueh, Hawat, The Baron, and Gurney. 

Yueh's lack of screentime and set-up is probably felt the most because he's the one who betrays them. So having him betray them in literally his 3rd scene on camera felt super rushed. 

That being said, there was so much to like that I'm sure others have mentioned here. 

All in all, a great movie and about as good of an adaptation as you can get.",qd6vqv
hhkwshv,"Fucking satisfied. 

Had seen the trailer but didn't know much about Dune. 

It was a great experience in IMAX with the visual and sound. 

Everyone was clapping at the end. 

Can't wait for part two",qd6vqv
hhlgo8a,"I never read the book and I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed 90% of the time. I thought the movie was going to pick up during the first sand-worm encounter. (that had me at the edge of my seat) I just felt there was way too many future flashbacks. Like I get it, Zendaya is gonna stab Paul sometime in the future. Do I really need to see that five times?",qd6vqv
hhmgagl,"Anyone else feel Hans Zimmer missed the mark with the score? It swelled at the wrong places, unimaginative and probably a little too “cliche desert” for me lol",qd6vqv
hhni8t3,This should have been a series on hbomax,qd6vqv
hhpdwdj,"I know Reddit has a boner for this film, but after paying to see this in Imax I’m going to give myself the right to be candid (and then properly downvoted lol)

Even when Keeping in mind that this is part 1 of an unfinished story, I can’t help but scream how mediocre this movie was.

The movie had its positives. It visually looked great (and hella expensive) the design of just about everything is top level stuff. I’d honestly love to see a concept art book for this movie even though I didn’t like the film. But besides that…. - everything else in this was bland as suburban baked chicken. 

Maybe the second half of the story is a lot more interesting, but I don’t even want to watch the next one. 

I am simply just not hooked, like at all. The movie had two and a half hours to hook me and it just never happened.

I’ve never read the book so I don’t know how strict of an adaptation it is, and maybe fans of the book will love this, I have no idea. 

But from someone who didn’t read a 400 page book before the movie, the dialogue and characters were so fucking stale. There was no energy and it completely lacked focus. Again, I’ve never read the book but the story and love of Dune seemingly runs on its intricate world and lore. 

And if that’s true, what an awful medium for them to choose for this adaptation. Movies as a medium provide possibly the absolute least room for intricate world building as films rely much more on large, emotional narrative beats.

This really should’ve been a high budget TV series. I have no idea why they ever tried to make this a movie. Warner Bros should’ve known better. Especially after pioneering the idea that not every grand scale story needs to be a film like they did with Game Of Thrones. If Denis V didn’t want to get off his high horse and make a tv show then find someone who will.

Call me crazy, but my theater was absolutely PACKED this Friday night and when the movie just unceremoniously ended like it did, the energy in room was akin to my local DMV on a Saturday morning.

Overall, 11/10.",qd6vqv

hhpotbg,"Having not read the book, I kind of thought it was a bit boring. Absolutely beautiful to look at with excellent production design, costume design, effects, and sound design but I had to fight to stay awake at a 4pm showing, especially in the first half of the movie. Disappointed as I love Villeneuve’s other work. I feel like I will enjoy it much more on a second viewing but my first take was not as enjoyable as I thought it’d be especially since I was looking so forward to this movie.",qd6vqv
hhrcmxe,"A bit frustrating to watch.  Loved the visual spectacle, the  long shots, the score, but those came at the expense of more detail and depth for characters like Dr Yueh, Thufir Hawat, the Baron, and even Lady Jessica.  Yueh's betrayal in this film is diminished to little beyond your classic ""They have my wife"" trope.  I want ""Plans in Plans"", more scheming, more political and societal intrigue...



Hell, keep the long beautiful shots, have even MORE of them...but make this a 12+ hour television series, because I believe that's the only way to do this story true justice.

Still, I'm excited by the idea of Part 2.  Loved the teasing shot of a Fremen riding a worm at the end...

Hopefully just the beginning, indeed.",qd6vqv
hhtczws,"Man, this is one of the very, very, very few really long movies that I wished would have been longer. Im going to actually read the books now, but I told my gf that this was literally like reading a good ass book. The whole balance and flow were excellent, and part 2 needs to be made ASAP

hlca5ii,"Wow. Just finished it and it was honestly a **massive disappointment** for me. I never read the books so was just going off of what I saw in commercials. Everyone who enjoyed this movie seems to have read the books. I'm curious what other non-book-readers think. 

To me it was like so much stuff was happening that didn't make sense to me and in the end all that really happened is Paul met the Fremen. This should have been a multiple season series in the same capacity as GOT. There was way too much backstory missing for it to be a coherent movie on its own. Maybe it will look better once the full series is out, but wow... my initial feelings are not good.

I can't wait to watch the CinemaSins video for this.",qd6vqv
hhnh2am,"Wow this was bad. Visually its okay, the topters were cool and most of the actors aswell. But the story...jeez.

I went in knowing nothing. I was able to understood like 2/3rd of the plot, the details were filled by my book reader friend. But holy hell it was sooo boring. 

Half the time the characters were just staring. The visions were annoying af so were the sudden shifts in contrast which hurt my eyes. But these are minor issues, I cant stress it enough, it was really boring.

Im a scifi lover so I expected to like it because ""its one the best scifis of all time"".But I cant. Timothée sucked, Zendaya had like 3 minutes of screen time. 

I known this is only the first half of the story, but even if a 2nd one gets made, I dunno if I can be arsed to watch that.

Also the trailers were a big fucking lie.

Also, It was interesting how so much was inspired by Arab culture.",qd6vqv
hhl8prq,"Zendaya was in like 4 scenes but the trailers made it seem like she was a center piece. Visuals were amazing. The characters were boring and them dying didn't feel impactful at all.

The visuals were absolutely amazing even if they completely went against many of the descriptions in the book they were still visually stunning.

I have to say the rushed nature of the movie and the massive amount of backstories and information left out just has me wanting a series for Dune so badly.

I had to explain way to much to my girlfriend because major plot points were 1 sentence and then moved on from like they didn't matter. Was also weird to have some of the names and words changed.

Overall it was a rushed movie that tried to cram a lot more in than they probably should have. Visually stunning though.",qd6vqv

hhwt8ji,I will echo the sentiment of so many people.  DUNE SHOULD BE A LIMITED SERIES.  This was beautiful but in order to keep pace and a decent run time they had to cut out so much of the political intrigue and neuter so many character motivations.  Dr Yeuh is paper thin in this movie.  He has a wife who the Harkonnens are holding hostage so he betrays the Atreides.  In the book it dives into how conflicted he is as a loyal member of Atreides.  It diminishes The Barron's cleverness in figuring out how to turn this man who has extreme training that shouldn't be able to be turned.  But that is thrown out in the name of pace.  Don't get me going on the travesty of Liet Kynes or even Lady Jessica.  It is a super pretty surface with no depth.,qd6vqv
hhy5v1l,"That first worm scene was so incredibly done. It was tense and epic.

Also, Hans Zimmer is a god.",qd6vqv
hhy6q5a,"This film solidified for me that Timothée Chalamet is a world class actor and he's only 25 years old! Among the cast of heavyweights, I thought Chalamet's performance was the most impressive and everyone was on their A-game: In no moment did it occur to me that anyone was acting. But Chalamet by far had the most difficult scenes, which isn't surprising given that he's the lead/protagonist.

[If he isn't already on your radar, mark my words: This kid has incredible potential, and based on interviews I've watched, he's intelligent and has a good head on his shoulders. So he's unlikely to make rash mistakes that would blacklist himself in the industry, and as long as he continue acting, I expect Oscars for him as he matures.]

What about Dave Bautista? I have no personal issues with him, but I don't consider him to be an acting heavyweight. He's got the look and has some comedic chops (these two tend to be expected for WWF wrestlers), but as a dramatic actor, he's mediocre (but not as bad as Keanu Reeves). I'd bet that he was cast to diversify the audience.",qd6vqv
hhz8iog,"Joy, a pure and utter joy. I grinned from ear to ear throughout it all. This is why I love films. Total escapism. From the opening shot and to the last and I was there, I was on that journey with them and I didn't want it to end. 

I have never managed to read the books. I have tried but felt it a bit intimidating but I guess that will now change after seeing the movie. Despite not reading it, I didn't feel lost. It was made in a way that allowed me to enjoy it without getting too lost. But I need to talk about a few things. 

* Greig Fraser's cinematography was incredible. As a big fan of cinematography, there were shots in this that constantly impressed me. I was a bit worried it may get a bit mundane once with getting to Arrakis but it kept finding a way to be beautiful. The scenes on Giedi Prime brought me back to Alien. The ritual with the blood sacrifice reminded of Giger. That whole scene, with the throat singing, may be one of my favourite things I've seen on screen. The cinematography needs to be seen on IMAX too. 
* Speaking of IMAX, the sound in this is stunnnig. The use of sound added to the otherworldly quality and felt hard sci fi at times. When the voice was being used it felt like my screen was 4D. The team behind the sound deserve all the plundits. Zimmer seemed to be having more fun than he has had in a while. That thumping bass at the beginning made me anxious and from that point on it was piece after piece that added more and more. I dont think it was WW bad as some people have said, I thought there was much more variety. The Benen Gesserit theme when they landed being a favorite of mine. 
* Design, again, needs to get all the recognition it deserves. The costume design and set design felt foreign but tangible. I loved the dash on the Ornithopter, a craft I would have loved as a toy as a kid. The other ships really got across the scale of everything. No matter what there was always something else on the screen to let you know how large everything is. Speaking of large, The Baron was so menacing. His first scene reminded me of Brando in Apocolypse Now and his last shot on the ceiling reminded me of Hereditary. The way the ""baddies"" are portrayed as pure brutes and ruthless helped establish the enormity of the whole story. The quickness in while the whole city and army were torn to shreds was shocking. 
* Acting-wise everyone brought their A-game. Special shoutout to Rebecca Fergusson. Also, Charlotte Rampling who despite being covered the whole time conveyed such terrifying authority. I didnt really expect Red Wedding levels of death which again added to the magnitude of what is happening.

&#x200B;

It's very clear this movie is not for everyone. It's a slow burn at times. But it ticked all the right boxes for me. It was refreshing to see design and visuals that felt truly alien. The world-building was brilliant. I can get why some people may have found it slow but for a nonreader of the book, that helped grasp wtf was going on. The point at which it ended seemed fine. I wasn't too annoyed about that, I just wanted more. The biggest compliment I can give it is I haven't felt like this in the cinema since the Fellowship of the Ring. I didn't want it to end. But, there's a book I now need to go and read and get lost in. 

Score: Spice up your life.",qd6vqv
hi0rgys,"Holy shit, it's a different movie in IMAX. The bass from The Voice *shook the theater*, no joke. It was nuts.",qd6vqv

hi8u56x,"Small question that took my brother and I out for a moment was when Duncan reached the helicopter dragonfly thing and it appeared the soldiers let him? Seems odd that was he able to get away in that battle, no? Other than that, super cool experience. Maybe a little too much “wait until part 2” but the sound and visuals were enough for me. Kinda wish this crew worked on Star Wars. It would be so dark and mysterious. But happy to finally see what all the hype around Dune has been!",qd6vqv
hi9jil6,"Just got back from seeing it.

As a movie? Absolutely wonderful. The atmosphere, the cinematography, acting, music, sound and all that stuff is just great. Very high quality and just a great watch overall.

As Dune though? That's where I'm not so sure about it. I have no issue with what was there, all of it was again just great, but it's what it *doesn't* have that lets it down. I read (most of) the book for the first time over the past week before going to see this, and there's just so, so much stuff that makes it a very intriguing, deep story and world, and all of that nuance seemed to be have been removed from the movie.

It has the big moments, the main parts to tell the overall story, but all the things that make it much more in-depth such as House Atreides knowingly going into a trap but underestimating it, knowing of there being a traitor and suspecting Jessica outwardly but they know its not really her, Sardaukaar disguised as Harkonnen to hide their involvement, the Barons plan with trying to affect the price of Spice and having stored it for decades, the Atreides trying to counter the Harkonnens moves with things like the attack on their Spice storage at Geidi Prime, the dinner party scene, the smugglers, the Fremen working with the Guild to stop satellites being put up to hide things in the desert, the importance of water being constantly mentioned etc weren't there at all. That in turn means characters like Gurney, Thuffir and Dr. Yueh have very little involvement in the movie and don't feel overly important. 

It's a shame to have almost none of that feature in the movie, I understand they couldn't have everything, but it makes it feel a bit like its too watered down in some ways. It's still an absolutely great movie though and I'd definitely recommend it.",qd6vqv
hie8j2v,"They managed to build such an elaborate world and universe in only a few hours. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. The costume design, the acting, the sets, the sound, the music!! It was absolutely beautiful, all of it. Fastest 2.5 hours of my life.",qd6vqv

himrzqr,"Just finished Dune. Im not sure what to say or think. It felt like Denis V loves the book so much and he understands it so much that his vision is layed out from that perspective - it feels like he was telling the story as if the audience already pre-read the source material. 

I had a hard time following the plot points. It didnt really set up the lore well or the characters and was rushing through to get as much info out as possible to the second act. It was also hard to follow because of the bad sound mixing and i could barely understand key dialogue at times. 

I also felt the combat was poorly choreographed and looked really staged. Lots of flat wide shots where people are just dully throwing each other around. 

The future visions devoided all tension out of the story as we kept seeing what was going to happen and at times felt heavy handed.  We knew he was gonna live from the first scene. Hence my point of Denis V knowing the material so much that he kind of took away the tension of the viewer. Maybe the visions are written better in the book as a way of foreshadowing? 

Didnt hate the film despite all this. There's a lot to love in the sheer scale of the cinematography. The music was also fantastic. Despite the loud chants of that lady who was screaming - kept thinking it was diagetic sound in film. 

I am keen to see where the sequel goes and hopefully tie it together to the first film. Or ill just read the book.",qd6vqv
hinrd0n,"Loved the movie, but I do have 3 minor critiques:

Not enough emphasis on the culture of water, or spice. I think this was supposed to be emphasized with the scene with the gardener watering the palms. I don't think this scene was in the book? But I think the scene from the book, and the sci-fi miniseries, in which people collected the castoff from the royalty washing their hands was a far more engaging way of showing the value of water, and then Leto abolishing the custom. We aren't shown any of the applications of spice, other than its prime uses, but in reality it's used in pretty much everything.

General oddities with the technology. What good are shields if you can just shoot an artillery shell at it, then wait a few seconds for it to slide through? If I recall again from the books, the use of stuff like a projectile weapon and artillery was analogous to using a slingshot or catapult (or a superior trebuchet) in our current times. No one used lasguns (much) because of the deadly and random reaction with shields. So basically that left you with knives/swords and poison. It seemed somewhat silly to see Gurney and the other warriors charging through an open field with swords as artillery raining down on them. We just needed a little more exposition about the technological state of things to smooth that out.

The emphasis on Chani. I think in the books she appears in Paul's visions, signaling his prescience starting to trickle. I think in the film we see three significant visions with her? And it's implied that she's this central, key figure surrounding Paul. She's definitely an important character, don't get me wrong, but I just feel like the movie is treating her like the fulcrum for Paul's future, and I never really interpreted that from the books.",qd6vqv
hjmiyib,"I understand a lot had to be cut but good god man if only they had included the banquet scene. It’s a **CRUCIAL** scene especially since a lot of the (rightly so) criticism is about how the audience didn’t feel a connection to the characters and had trouble following the political plot. That scene would have hammered home how incredibly valuable even small amounts of water are in this planet. A better insight on why the Harkonnens and Atreides were feuding and how valuable control of Arrakis is and how the imperium and guild come into play. The suspicions of spies and traitors. And showing another side of Paul and how naturally charismatic he can be and how much more mature he is for his age and earning respect of his elders. And above all else allows the plot to breathe. Man I’m so bummed they didn’t include that. 

All in all though I enjoyed it and glad to experience this in a theater. The visuals were jaw dropping. I think it’s a shoo in for a costume design and original score Oscar nod at the very least. My non book reading gf liked it and we watched it again today on HBO Max. Can’t wait for part 2",qd6vqv

im going to watch part 2 for the lore and hoping it gets 10x better than this. but i will never rewatch this fuck this shit",qd6vqv

hhkx4u2,"I am a child of the 80’s. So, the work that Denis Villeneuve has done with Blade Runner and now with Dune really resonates. I remember reading the book on a road trip to Mexico City, which is a 36-hour drive. I took the book from a library and never returned it, I was enthralled by the world Frank Herbert had created, the fact that a glossary and appendix was included just to make head or tails of the large cast of characters and languages and technology. Nothing like what Tolkien did but still impressive.

Brazil, Blade Runner, Dune are the top of my favorite movies. These are the ones I can see multiple times and never tire. I was worried about the sequel to Blade Runner, but Denis proved to be able to make a sequel to a movie that had at one time bombed in the theaters and then be recut into multiple versions and the Final Cut become a cult classic.

I knew DUNE was in good hands. I was not disappointed. The movie is almost a shot for shot remake of the 1984’s David Lynch’s Dune. I find it incredible that Denis was able to talk characters we already know and dialogue we have read and heard before and still breathe in new life. This is a testament to the cast, being able to bring an ensemble group of actors with so much talent. The dialogue resonates and still sent chills up my spine. The film has a cadence

The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, we get to see more of Caladan and also get to understand a bit more of house Atreides. The worlds though few are varied.

I love the small details they add such as the bull fighting motif both from the statues and the trophies of the fallen bulls the house Atreides is decorated with.

As the focus on the bullfighting statute, a juxtaposition between man and animal locked in eternal struggle. Which harkens back to the struggle between House Harkonnen (the beasts) and House Atreides (the humans) as has been proven by the Mother Mohiam of the Bene Gesserit through her gom Jabbar.

The music and wardrobe are spectacular, Has Zimmer has made a unique soundtrack. There has been a lack of unique sounding soundtracks of late, there is a great youtube video that breaks down the lack of unique music that evokes the visuals of a movie, I think to the celesta melody in Hedwig’s theme of Harry Potter, as soon as you hear the opening tune you are transported to Hogwarts. Hans Zimmer has delivered with the score, and I love the version of Pink Floyd’s Eclipse, for the soundtrack. The music goes from choir, to middle eastern sounding to at times an industrial motif.

They have finally made ornithopters that look real and function like the intended fireflies they are based on. CGI is always hard because you think that it looks good in the moment, but you wonder how it will hold up in the future. Denis believes in practical effects, and it shows.  The Atreides ships and spice navigator’s guild ships look great. The personal shields look far superior to the boxy, hilarious version in the 1984 movie.  
I prefer this Timothy’s Paul Atreides to Kyle Maclachlan’s portrayal, this Paul in naïve, does not understand the political danger that his family is in, he know he must train and be prepared to fill his father’s shoes. But does not see the “plans with in plans” that his family has been trapped in. While Kyles’s version was an older and at times a almost ready Duke to take the reigns of House Atreides. Timothy’s version will benefit from being young, foolish and his story arc will show true growth in his character.   
There is so much more I can write but, all I can say is yes, you can stream it on HBOMAX, but please show the movie the respect it deserves and see it in the cinema. The music, sound effects and cinematography deserve to be experienced on the big screen. Plus it will show Warner that the next movie need to be made.

hhl59t9,"I think you have to be a fanboy to enjoy this movie. If I hadn't read the books, I would've been bored/lost.",qd6vqv
hhlk7rp,"Some people can never get over the fact that a book based movie will *never* be able to tell as much story as it does in the novel. A lot of book readers complaining on here about the film missing out on certain details. While this is inevitably true, it’s why I say that the movies aren’t meant to be a replacement for the book but a *complement* to it. 

I use the example of Lord of the Rings (my favourite movie + books of all time). I recently re-watched the movies for the umpteenth time with my sister who has never watched them or read the books.  Despite loving it, she had lots of questions after every film that I realised were only answerable by people with background knowledge of the world from the books. And sometimes I noticed things that didn’t raise questions for her but could only be appreciated by someone with that knowledge e.g. the significance of Gimli receiving 3 hairs from Galadriel.

It’s great to be able to go into these films with broader knowledge of the world and simply enjoy the ride. Dune was absolutely magnificent and I’m glad it didn’t go into every single detail of the book because otherwise it would need to be a tv show with far less production value and scope. Dune was an incredible cinematic experience that still told a coherent story and created mystery for non book readers as opposed to irritating questions. For book readers like myself, that experience was simply complemented by the fact I knew the lore and significance of what was being shown. 10/10 for me.",qd6vqv

hhrjv5y,"I know most people here are loving on the movie but it didn't work for me. It somehow felt both very slow and also like the plot was rushed. Characters barely had screen time and then were dead so it was hard for me to care about them at all.

Really makes me think that Dune should not have been a movie at all and should have been a limited series",qd6vqv
hhswthw,"Felt like I was flipping through a graphic novel with amazing artwork. 

The plot was plodding though. It took too long to get to thr point. I don’t mind a slow burn, but at least make the burn interesting.

hi3ct50,"None book reader here. My thoughts:

* I'm a huge Villenueve fan so it will come as no surprise that I loved Dune. 
* I saw it in IMAX and the scale, visuals, audio etc are all spectacular. I loved the use of the Voice in particular, especially the scene in the Thopter - that was so brutal and dark and I loved the green lighting in that scene. 
* Speaking of dark, I'm a sucker for dark, sinister, grotesque villains and the Baron certainly fit that bill. I loved the atmosphere of the Harkonnen scenes and I only wish we got more of them. That shot in particular of the Baron rising in the background and moving across the table towards Leto was so well done. 
* I was thoroughly entertained throughout and it did not feel like a 2.5 hour film - I didn't want it to end and my main disappointment is that the second part wasn't filmed back-to-back with the first so we'll have to wait at least 2-3 years for more.
* The first sandworm encounter was thrillingly tense - Villenueve has a real knack for generating tension and atmosphere. 
* I enjoyed the attack on Arrakeen - those were some of the most spectacular and bombastic explosions I've ever seen on screen! However I would have liked a bit more build up to the battle. It lacked the build-up of tension from the earlier sandworm scene and it all felt a bit easy for the Harkonnens and Sardaukar (maybe that was the point). The betrayal from the doctor and the way he immediately spelled out the reason for the betrayal felt a bit lacking from a storytelling perspective but I get that they didn't have a lot of time to flesh this out more.
* Villenueve did a great job of slowly building up and introducing the characters and world in the first half and then generating a wave of intense action beats in the second half that really gave it a thrilling sense of momentum (from the hunter-seeker, to the sandworm encounter, to the attack on Arrakeen, to the Thopter escape and tooth poison scenes, to the Sardaukar attack with Duncan's death, to the sandstorm, and then the final sandworm encounter and duel).
* It goes without saying that the climax didn't at all feel climactic, though I fully understand that this is only half of the story and by all accounts this was the right place to end the first part. However I did feel the final duel between Paul and Jamis lacked any real impact or tension at all. The rest of the film did a good job of making you feel that no character was safe from death, but I never felt that of Paul and we didn't know Jamis at all so the stakes just weren't there. Also it was all a bit easy for Paul and you never got the sense that Jamis was such a great warrior as Chani had suggested.
* I didn't find it confusing at all, though having seen some comments on here that give extra context to things like how the shields work, why guns and other long range weaponry aren't used, and the lack of computer technology etc, I would have appreciated some explanation of this in the film though I understand it would have been difficult to fit such exposition in without it feeling forced and unnatural.
* Overall a great cinema experience and I can't wait for Part 2! Though I now have a big dilemma in that I can't decide whether to read the book now or to wait and go into Part 2 blind... though that is a long time to hold on!",qd6vqv
hiago63,"That was ... an experience. Gotta say, I feel very conflicted about this movie. I certainly didn't enjoy it very much, but I have very little negative to say about it. It very much felt like I was not the intended audience (I haven't read the book).

Probably my biggest complaint is that the movie didn't present enough questions to keep me engaged. Like, everything seemed to make sufficient sense. I went into it pretty much blind and nothing stood out as confusing or unexplained. But to such degree, I just felt bored. I almost want to call it offensively inoffensive, but that seems too harsh.

Basically, as someone else here mentioned. The lore wasn't the focus, the story was. But the story was rather simplistic and easy to follow. I mean, I don't want to blame the movie, since it's literally only adapting half of a book, but it kinda makes the movie boring.

One thing I didn't like was the score. Well, it was mostly fine, it's just that they should really take away the horn from Zimmer. It was just annoying and almost never added anything to the scenes.",qd6vqv
hhkoekv,"Movie looked good but holy shit was it boring. Should have been rated R and it would have been much better. Idk what the all the hype was about tbh, 2 1/2 hrs of CW type bs lol",qd6vqv
hhkwu12,"Think this would have worked much better as a tv series. 

Didn't care about any of the characters. I think if it was a series you could at least flesh out all the characters, and the politics of this universe. Instead you have the most stacked cast of A-listers and they each get 5 minutes of screen time before getting killed off. 

The movie hammers you with a bunch of terminology from the book that just gets confusing. I'm sure fans of the book will like it. But I don't think it'll be embraced by most audiences. It's also great that one of the major moments in the trailer was nothing but a vision of the next movie. The pacing was awful and I don't think there was a single standout scene. I was excited to see what would happen with the sandworms, but nothing really does. 

I will say the movie looks great. Great visual effects and production design. I found the score a little underwhelming.

4/10 Just didn't do it for me. Hopefully Part 2 is great but this pales in comparison to Denis's other films",qd6vqv
hhl9jq7,"Weakest Villeneuve movie I've seen. All the vision scenes and slow mo really drag it down. There's like this epic music when there's literally nothing important going on. Baron' bald face? Uriaaa uriaaa. And Paul just comes off as straight unlikeable in this movie.

This fell really short of the standard set by Fellowship of the Ring, the last knife fight is just comical for a movie ending lol",qd6vqv
hhkzr8m,"I would like to preface this with a few points about myself, as a viewer: I have not read the book/s. I have not seen any other version of dune on film. I enjoy deep sci-fi and fantasy, especially politically charged and war based (e.g. gundam, GoT).

I hated this movie. So fucking boring. So pretentious to assume we already know what’s going on - I am ALL for Hollywood not thinking we are idiots who need half the movie to be exposition, but goddam do we need SOME. This is a film for people who already know the story and that is a travesty of a place to start any form of storytelling from, especially when trying to tell something so grand as to need more than three hours to tell. This is downright HARD to follow for any newcomer, and as such it feels like a waste of time and money to see.

I am not looking forward to the response of people who have read the books, or of people who have seen the other versions of this, or of the pseudo-intellects who read the synopsis before, during, or after their view and now want to act like they get it. However, I am genuinely interested to hear if anyone else seeing this story for the first time, without any prior knowledge, enjoyed this.

Ambition should not get points when it comes to story telling. I don’t care what you WANTED to do, I care about what you did, and the journey I took. On that level this film is a failure.",qd6vqv

* Space-faring civilizations who seemingly haven't invented ceiling lights yet

Why does he have to do anything at all?  What did he have against the Atreides?  What about the planet the Atreides are from; how is it doing?  Maybe they are from more than one planet.

it’s like this movie is good only if you’re familiar with what they were mumbling about, only if you’re familiar with the dark places they were fighting in, and only if you already knew where the story was headed.

10/10. I have no words that would do it justice. This is easily one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made. Just the visuals and the sound design alone were breathtaking, and left me stunned. 

I can't say enough about the cast. Everybody was giving some of their best performances, but I thought that Josh Brolin especially was a standout in his smaller role. His scene with Timothée where they are training at the beginning of the film was one of my favorites.

It was very fun to watch. I know that I had a stupid grin on my face almost the entire time, but I didn't even care. If anything has ever been worth the wait, this movie was it.

I'm so glad that I was able to see it in theaters, because it was truly made for the biggest screen and best sound system. That said, I can't wait to rewatch it on HBO Max tomorrow.

In the 1984 movie, I felt like a lot of people died and I was supposed to be sad about it but I didn't quite 'get' it. But here, hell yeah. The Atreides were totally decimated. And the convoluted plot of the book was actually clear. The Emperor was getting the Harkonnens and Atreides to fight to stop either of them from going for the throne. That's tough to get across.  I was nervous about the casting switch on Dr Kynes but DAMN she was great. Probably one of my favorite characters.    

The only criticisms were that at some points, a few of the characters had poor diction and I wasn't sure what was being said. The soundtrack was OTT all the time, and the 'visions' just kept on coming so much. I felt like I needed some dialogue scenes where people weren't laying down heavy stuff. I needed some just 'shooting the shit' scenes. Which I sort of got with Paul talking to his dad before they left and the sparring session with Gurney and some of the Duncan dialogue.

hhnbz9r,"An absolutely 9.5/10 movie for me. It was almost perfect, and so similar to what I imagined as a kid when reading the book. My only real gripes is that there are certain scenes and a subplot that were cut, and some pretty important information that never made it in (or wasn't at all clear).

The scenes I'm referring to are the dinner scene with the important people of Arrakeen (the city on Arrakis), during which we are shown that Paul and Jessica are both exceptionally skilled at reading people and dissecting the minutiae details of social interaction in a room full of people all trying to further their own goals. The second scene is when Jessica discovers a message hidden by the Bene Gesserit warning of the Harkonnen threat.

The subplot that was missing is also pretty important IMO, and it's a shame they didn't include it. It's essentially that Thufir Hawat discovers there is a traitor in the Atreides household and comes to believe it is Jessica, and there's this whole scene where they almost kill each other.

As for the information that should have been made more clear: they never really specified what a Mentat was, men trained and psychoactively 'improved' in order to become human 'computers', who also often act as Master of Assassins and intelligence for the Houses they come to serve. They also never mentioned the whole lasgun thing, where if a las weapon (which are actually scene a couple of times in the film) hits a personal shield, it causes a reaction that cause both to explode with the power of an atomic bomb. That's why there aren't really any ranged weapons in the movie, because the lasguns are an incredible risk to both attacker and defender, and also the personal shields stop conventional firearms.",qd6vqv

I still enjoyed it and it’s better than the average action flick but I still couldn’t help but feel like I was missing something story and character wise, which is the most important part of storytelling.",qd6vqv
hhqp3kx,"I saw it last night. Honestly I wasn't engaged by it at all.     

Yes it looks good but looks alone is not enough.      

I think ultimately this movie won't be the success people want it to be because it won't engage with casual audiences. I am only familiar with the book. As in I know what it is, what the general story is and how influential it was. So I had some idea of what to expect, but I think many people won't know that much and see this as unoriginal. Sort of the ""seinfeld isn't funny"" trope.      

They will be familiar with everything inspired by Dune and not know what came first. Because this honestly felt like something I've seen before, but not as good.       

I think the fact that this is ""part 1"" was also a mistake. The marketing does not relay that message at all and a sequel is not guaranteed at this time. People will watch expecting a complete story only to have the movie just end. There isn't a satisfying conclusion. Even if a sequel was guaranteed this part 1 should have enough to stand on its own with a satisfying conclusion. I had serious Matrix reloaded vibes from that ending, and Matrix Revolutions was already shot and due to be released that fall. It will be years before Dune 2, if ever.       

I feel the movie could have used some exposition dumps. I know no one really likes them, but sometimes they are necessary. Especially in a world as dense as this. Something other than a single line of dialogue thrown in for those that don't know the backstory or mythology. I know you should show, not tell but sometimes you need to get this information across and the best way sometimes is an exposition dump.        

Overall I guess you could say I was bored by it. Sadly ""Seinfeld isn't funny"" applies here as I feel I have seen this all before. As I understand the book is considered difficult to adapt. But there is nothing that says it should be adapted. I understand fans want a faithful adaptation, sadly you can't please everyone and money matters most in Hollywood. I think a game of thrones style show would have been better. Long form would serve this property better than trying to cram it all into 2 movies. Because you will either end up adapting the book and pleasing fans, while alienating the casual audience like I think this movie will do, or you adapt in very loose ways, lose hardcore fans and hope it is enough for casual audiences.      

One last thing, I don't know what was with my audio mix, but I could barely understand some of the dialogue. I would have loved some subtitles.",qd6vqv

hhs3ttb,"Incredible movie. Only issue is they did Leto dirty. Yes, being played by Oscar was dope but:

They left out his lines about how he knew it was a trap, but better to walk in to the trap you see than the one you dont. 

Anyone who didnt read the book would be screaming, ""DUDE WHAT ARE YA DOIN!?"" as he took his family and house to Arrakis.

hhsh2ur,"I thought this film was wonderfully shot, well acted by the cast and had some great CGI, but I found the plot very difficult to follow along.

So there is an emperor and two families, the bald people family and the space Scotland family. The bald people family did originally have the spice world but the emperor has given the spice world to the space Scotland people now.

So they go to Spice world and the bald people come to take them out because they feel betrayed I think. Also Paul (Amazing name for a main character in a sci fi epic) has the power of genesis and sees visions. I have no clue the rest of his B plot.

I've got some questions that would be really helpful if people could clear up for me:

1. What happened to Josh Brolins character? Did he die because I didn't see him die?
2. How did Stellan's character survive? He literally took poison straight to the face?
3. Paul watched that hologram documentary on Sand walking, yet spends the majority of the film full on sprinting through the sand and about 2 minutes sand walking. What's up with that?
4. So they've got these extremely high tech suits to help them survive in the sand yet no character in the movie wears anything to protect their eyes? Could someone explain that?
5. Why was Zendaya top billed in this film? Myself and my GF specifically went to this film because she wanted to see a Zendaya movie and she left really disappointed. She had maybe 6 minutes of screen time and that's being generous and we have no idea who her character was?
6. This is the part that confused me the most. Near the beginning of the film, Paul has to take this test where he puts his hand in a box. The woman says 'Animals when trapped will chew off their leg, what would you do?' and Paul does... Nothing. He is clearly in pain and does nothing. He has a hand free, he could've slapped the posion dart away. Kept his hand in the box and smacked the box at her head. What was going on there?

sucks that at minimum we probably won't get the next one until fall/winter 2023....

it sucks duke leto and duncan idaho die so early on, i really liked them. wonder what happened to gurney 

as someone who never read the book, i don't quite understand some of the major plot points such as 

1. if duke leto knew this was some fool's errand and a trap, why accept Arakis? why not just decline the emperor and not take control of arakis ? 

2. shouldn't they (Atredies) have sent an advanced team of engineers to inspect the harvesting equipment to make sure they wouldn't be screwed? 

3. if the emperor simply feared the Atredies , why not just directly attack them on Caladan? why go through the charade of giving them Aarakis for a short time? 

4.did the Atredies give up Caladan when they took over Arakis? and if they didn't , why did the main family have to be on Arakis? couldn't they have sent workers instead? 

Tangent : 

I wonder if the Zelda writers stole from Dune as Gannon is the chosen one leader because he's the only male heir born to a sect of women

hhytqbq,"I went in with guarded expectations, being a fan of the 1984 version and worrying this one would either fail to live up to its predecessor, or fail for trying too hard to live up to its predecessor.

I was pleasantly dissuaded of that concern after a short while.  I liked the beginning...it departed from the text and the Lynch version fairly substantially, but I think it did a good job of setting up the universe and introducing the characters, without getting bogged down in tiresome expo.

The cinematography (if you can call it that, being almost entirely digital) was excellent, it really captured the epic feel of the 80s sci fi matte-painting era, which was an art largely lost through the 90s and 2000s.  I thought they struck an excellent balance between letting the beauty shots breathe, but not so much that it bogs down the pacing of the story.  And I love how they were able to maintain the Gigeresque darkness of Giedi Prime and the Harkonnen visual aesthetic.

Same for the score - it perfectly complements the visuals, which very much lives up to what Toto did for the classic version, but not in a way that's too imitative.  The only thing possibly lacking is an actual theme-song track with a distinctive musical hook, the way Toto had their electric-guitar-and-orchestra title track.

I thought the casting was generally great - Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin, especially, I think, really did well fleshing out characters that were somewhat vaguely defined in the older movie.  Even if they were, kinda, just Ronon Dex and Cable again...it fit with the source material.  Oscar Isaac brought a lot of charisma to Leto too.

Now, though, the bad parts...and of course some of these are well-discussed already:

- The cutoff seemed arbitrary.  I get what they were thinking thematically, I think - Paul killing for the first time is a major turning point in his emotional development, its a coming-of-age...its the end of his innocence, so they made it the end of the first film.  But narratively its jolting.  The runtime was already so long; they could've left it, I think, at the fall of Arrakeen as a nice ESB-style dark-note cliffhanger.

- While the beginning was nicely paced and balanced, the second half started to really drag out.  Too many visions that lasted too long, too much wandering around to finally get to the Stilgar part.  They clipped out plenty from the first half that was superfluous to the story, in a way that helped the film, but left a lot in the back half.  The whole scene in the old ecological station, for instance, seemed entirely redundant.  Why do we need to have a second Sardaukar attack that they get away from?  Just have Duncan and Kynes die in the first attack and save that whole sequence.

- I thought the Mentats were entirely underutilized.  They only have one token ""calculation"" on screen each; its unclear what exactly they even are.  And I think Piter was the most wasted character in the whole film...Brad Dourif's original was a masterpiece of creepiness that really captured the essence of the Harkonnen zeitgeist.  This Piter was just entirely forgettable, with barely any dialogue and no real distinguishing characteristics at all.  Except...he had a pet spider, I guess?

- I get why they made Yueh Chinese...the name sounds Chinese, and they were looking for places to diversify the casting.  But...why does he speak Mandarin to Paul?  Like both in terms of why does the character do it, and why does Mandarin still exist at all when no other Earth language is still shown to be living?

- ""For the father...nothing.""  Wish they had kept that line, it's an important one and one that could've fit the scene still

- The Baron didnt seem quite as menacing in this version as in other adaptations...they seem to be leaning much more heavily into the ""floating fat man"" aspect and less into the cruelty and cunning of the character.  He's really got no agency in this plotline at all, he just sits back and lets the Emperor carry out his scheme to bring down House Atreides.  At times he seemed almost senile with his quiet mumbling and 1000-yard stare.  I dont think he needed to chew the scenery quite as much as in '84, but it would've been nice to see *some* kind of evil glee when he was gloating over Leto.

- Dave Bautista really killed it as a Beast Rabban that showed off the barbaric nature of the character without making him just a dumb animal like he's usually shown; its much more plausible why the Baron left him in charge of Arrakis.  However...FEYD RAUTHA!?  He definitely doesnt fill those missing shoes entirely.  Feyd is the Anti-Paul, the story needs him there to be Paul's final battle and avenge his House.  If they're just trying to use Rabban to merge the entire character of Feyd into, I think its really going to weaken the overall narrative.

- Padishah is pronounced ""PAW-di-shaw"", not ""pa-DEESH-uh"" :)

- Why were they firing a lasgun at Duncan's thopter, when they had clearly just shown it was shielded?  I'm pretty sure the Emperor would be upset if you nuked 3 legions of his Sardaukar just to get one dude, even if it is Duncan Idaho :D

- I get they didnt want to just remake anything straight out of Lynch's...but it reeeeeally bugs me the sandworms dont close their mouths.  Like, do they just constantly swallow sand as they swim around through it?",qd6vqv

hi6agtg,"First, I’ll start with the good. The visuals were stunning and the music was fantastic. Oscar Isaac is a phenomenal actor.

Now, what I didn’t like about the film. I felt where it left off, the movie could have been a lot shorter. There were a lot of visual scenes just to show off the landscape of the planets, architecture, etc. without any dialogue to further the story. The beginning of the movie has a narrator but you couldn’t narrate any scenes beyond that?

I think it's unfair to the audience, particularly those unfamiliar with the source material, to give them an incomplete and fragmented story. Spectacle is great and all but it needs to be in the actual service of something. 

The plot machinations felt opaque and lacked drama or stakes. Actors/characters came quickly in and out of the movie, or had precious little to do.

The movie, as movies go, is good. Cinematography is great, production value very high, sold A-list cast, but it falls flat for me. The pacing felt off, time jumps galore with little indication. The lore was not explained well enough to understand everyone's motivations and the character quirks. Why does the Baron float? Why didn't he die due to the poison? Why was he in the pool of oil? What was that pet he had? Why is Paul allergic to Spice? Who are the Bene Gesserit? Why do they rule from the shadows? Who is Jessica in relation to the Bene Gesserit? Was she a former member? Was she exiled? Did she leave willingly? What's The Voice? Why does it control people? Why do some people like the Bene Gesserit wield it stronger than others? Can it control all living things? Can it not control the sand worms? Why can't they be killed? The current imperium has shield technology that withstands darts and swords, you'd think an equally powerful bomb could kill them?

Both mediums carried the story and presented the relationships of the characters in such a way that I cared what happened and was both anxious and nervous to see what transpired, despite knowing what happened. 

I nearly fell asleep during this movie because the director cared more for visuals than telling a good story.

hile2pn,"Just finishing watching it. 

I couldn't be more disappointed. This was the film of the year I was looking forward to, and what I watched was absolutely dreadful.

Nobody is human. 

They don't behave or act like humans, their societal structure makes no sense and nothing that was on screen managed to capture my interest or imagination. 

The son is basically born to be special due to centuries of breeding and seemingly just is so.

What kind of plot is that?

The intrigue between the two factions that the Emperor is playing off against one and other has the potential to be really interesting, but is horribly portrayed. 

And what about their world? Where is 80 years of wealth for the first house? Where has their money gone? Every world and room is so barren, clean and lifeless. There is nothing human in any of the aesthetic. 

What do these people do between planning and wandering around looking emotionally heavy? As far as I can tell from the film ... nothing. They have no interests or motivations beyond mining spice or plotting a centuries long eugenics programme. 

It was a total and bitter disappointment and honestly as bad as a 2/10 for me. 

Nothing I saw on screen possessed enjoyment, interesting ideas or something that could be relatably human. 

This is why Ridley Scott's contribution to science fiction is so pivotal. He shows us dirty and lived in worlds, with real people going about their daily business as best as they can, even in the face of larger hardships they are unfortunate enough to get caught up in. 

What motivates the humans in Dune to stand around and chant a families name and always be on ceremony? What do they recieve for their loyalty and service? Protection, land, trickle down wealth? None of that is shown and it makes everything feel so shallow and lifeless. People run around and do as commanded, but why?

Why does a prince of a powerful family seemingly have no luxury or enjoyment? He really spends his days wandering around the world looking meaningfully at a sunset as he endures premonitions? That's his existence?

Think of Game of Thrones. They plot, they scheme, they advance plans and move entire peoples as fits their desires .... but they are human, they have downtime, they have loves and passions and hatreds and faults. 

Nobody in Dune really exists as a human, they seemingly spend all their time standing on ceremony for reasons of a resource and wealth that return nothing. Where IS that wealth? Nobody is enjoying it. 

Why do they endure that kind of social structure? It seems like it benefits nobody at the bottom? Where is everybody that isn't in their military?

Just got out of the theatre. First, the good stuff: I am a big fan of the book and was happy to see a faithful adaptation. The casting and cinematography are top notch. It’s a beautiful film. 

That said, as was the case with Blade Runner 2049 (in my humble option), the movie is plodding. Dune is 400 pages, which isn’t *that* long. Yet, it’s on pace for 5 hours in Villeneuve’s two-part adaption. I think that’s too much. I think Velleneuve has a tendency to be self-indulgent.

Story wise...dryer than the sands of Arrakis. So much missing. I find it really strange what was included and what was not. 

There were little bits of verbatim dialog which could have omitted instead of entire subplots and world building that were not included. 

Missing:

1. Jessica's role in the conspiracy and knowledge of the trap is huge. ""And for the father, nothing."" Jessica defying the Bene Gesserit out of love for Leto was a major point--she could have married an Atreides daughter to the Harkonen heir. Where was the matronly tension between Jessica and the Reverend Mother? The Reverend Mother forcing Paul's silence over the trap?

2. The tension between the Mentat and Bene Gesserit schools. The Butlerian Jihad? Thufir and Lady Jessica? Where was Piter De Vries?  What about the Navigators? The actual explanation of the breeding program...female and male memories?

3. Where is Feyd Rautha?

4. The Baron's plot and depth of planning? The tension between Feyd and the Baron? What about CHOAM? The Spacing Guild? What about the tripod?

5. Paul, Mapes, the hunter/seeker and the traitor?

6. The dinner with the Atreides and the political elite? The elite's disdain for the Fremen, their fear of Liet? Leto's ploy with Jessica. Idaho getting drunk? Yueh's backstory? Yueh's betrayal of the Duke and double cross of the Baron?

7. The establishment of water as a currency on the level of spice?  The Arrakeen conservatory? 

8. The conflict that Liet has between prophecy and pragmatism? Liet's dream of transforming the planet? Water caches? The conversation where Paul wins Liet over?

9. Thufir's capture? The joining of waters? The Baron versus the Sardaukar captain?

10. Gurney as the warrior poet. Gurney and the smugglers.

11. Paul's revelation that Jessica is the Baron's daughter, that she is pregnant, his knowledge that they will die without spice (they are trapped on Dune), and will find refuge with the Fremen. 

12. All of the Fremen rituals, Bene Gesserit influence, and Jessica's manipulation of the Missionara Protectiva? Chani as Paul's keeper? The cave with Jamis, Paul regarded as a scorpion because of his near super-human fighting? Paul giving water to the dead?

13. Muad'dib? Usul? Liet's death? Worms and spice? 

These are all small moments, but really important in building Herbert's world, the plot, and understanding the characters. The characters in this movie are diminished and far less interesting. This movie is dead because there is no character development and there is no exploration of their choices and motivations.

It's disappointing because they took so much time to add superfluous scenes (hikes around Caladan, under water space fleet, Paul and the date palms, the sand crawler drama, the flight through the sand storm drama, Paul having an allergic reaction to spice, pointless conversations with Chani, for examples), but removed most of the backstory, mysticism, political intrigue, and character tension from the book. It was just full of really dull choices that flattened the characters and treats the audience as if they're too dumb to bear the deeper story that made the book incredible. 

This was visually stunning and amazing in scale. Visually, it looks like Frank Herbert's Arrakis. It looks awesome. Just awesome. I love the visuals. The acting was excellent. 

Storywise, it's just a disappointment. It was weird how in some moments they lifted dialog from the book, but in all the places I expected key points from the book, they made a deliberate choice to ignore them...almost like they were making this version in response to earlier versions (Lynch, SciFi Channel) and were not going to repeat material. It's just disappointing. Dune is almost 60 years old. There's a reason why a sci-fi book originally published by an auto industry manual publisher (Chilton) is still--still--regarded as one of the greatest pieces of sci-fi and held up as an example by which all others are sometimes judged. It's the story...and it's brilliant.

Thankfully, this movie is a universe better than Lynch's suckass monstrosity (but this version still portrays the Harkonnens as grotesque and the Baron as a one dimensional floating slob, rather than a rich, powerful, Machiavellian strategist that out manuevered the Atriedes). Lynch added so much weirdness with heart plugs, cat stroking, rodent juice boxes, Mentat eyebrows, weirding modules, and Feyd in a speedo. 

The Sci-Fi channel mini-series is still the best adaptation and told in just about the same amount of time (if the second movie gets made). It had its quirks and weak points, but it brought the book to life...

hhufmua,"I'm not gonna kiss Villaneuve's ass on this one, I enjoyed it but damn, this movie's got problems. Somehow characters like Yueh or Piter got less characterization than the 1984 version despite having a longer runtime and only covering the first half. Where TF did the time go? Hell Yueh had what, 2 lines of dialogue before his big betrayal? Piter dies in the background from poison gas and until then is just some bald guy who does the Baron's bitch work?

&#x200B;

I'm still trying to figure out where the time was spent, but there were definitely way too many dream sequences. Why did we get a slow motion dream sequence of Paul taking a knife to the gut when he clearly outclasses and kills the guy 5 minutes later. Why so many visions of Chani? The movie only needed two visions - one of Chani and another of the 'holy war' leading to his freakout. The rest didn't move the plot forward whatsoever.

Duncan was great, had no problem with him taking more scenes since Frank Herbert himself loved the character so much.

There was also a lot of unnecessary screentime spent on things that really had no big relevance to the plot. I know certain events may have happened in the books but it would totally have made sense to cut certain things out. The hand in a box scene seems like its probably iconic, but I mean in the grand scheme of things how did affect the plot? It really didn't other than the characters swearing Paul is acting different. Is he? I couldn't tell at all. The constant visions were more of an annoyance than anything. Having one clear vision would have helped so much more in terms of clarity than a bunch of hazy visions where you can barely tell what's happening. A ton of the movie is just characters walking and giving looks to eachother while music blares in the background to convince you something is happening. Also why don't they use the voice on the Fremen near the end? Also why did the Fremen in the end want to kill Paul, that made no sense. There was very clearly an attempt to ""show not tell"" for exposition, but that doesn't work at all when there's so much god damn exposition needed. More scenes talking about the politics and setting the scene would have been appreciated and you totally could have cut out like half the movie and ended it with Duke Leto dying. Would have been a more dramatic end anyway. I was talking with 3 friends afterward and all of them misunderstood at least one major plotpoint.

hhtpz6h,"Besides the continuous and permanent soundtrack that irritated my ears and the dialogue that I sometimes couldn't hear, the worst thing for me was the over-expository dialogue.

I felt like a child being held by the hand by the writers which pointed the index finger where I should look.

These characters... People don't talk like that in everyday life, at all.

Ex 01:

When the doctor meets the villain, they actually wrote a line for the villain just to make sure the audience understands the scene by saying loud and clear ""The doctor. The traitor. Who turned off the shields and cut off communication "". As if viewers had the memory of a goldfish and couldn't remember the scene that took place literally minutes before, of the doctor stabbing the duke in the back.

Ex. 02:

In training, the MC fights the teacher, who after hitting him says: ""if my blade were alien blade, the blade would have gone through your shield."" But he spoke this out loud to a swordsman who trains every day using this shield specifically... and who most likely already knew this piece of information.

Ex. 03:

They meet a scientist who explains in detail how the armor to survive in the desert they are wearing works... Except they were ALREADY wearing the armor, and most likely already knew why their lives depended on the armor, most likely they already knew they would die without it from dehydration, etc. The geisha-umbrella character literally speaks a few scenes before that planet's dry heat would kill them in two hours. Again, over-explanation.

The worst part of all for me is how bland the MC is. If it weren't for the villain taking the initiative, he would spend the rest of his life having breakfast with Mom, sword training, watching Discovery TV-hologram alone in his room, having nightmares and occasionally asking Dad and Uncle if he could turn into a serious adventurer and be told NO.

He barely has a personality or flaws. For a moment it even seems like he has some sort of goal, to become an adventurer, but he says aloud shortly after that he just wanted to accompany his uncle on the next expedition because he had an (incorrect) premonition of him dying in action and thought he was were present could prevent it.

Movie is boring. Too many wasted CGI. Too many city-porn and spaceship-porn.",qd6vqv
hhvx76l,"All style, no substance, felt like an over glorified cgi tech demo. Seems like big object + loud sound is all it takes to impress people now a days.

Color palette was drab and muted, completely washed out, had the same sterile look that every other Hollywood sci-fi in the past 10 years had. They're on a desert, yeah, but there's more hues and tints other than muted gray and oranges. 

And not gonna lie I hated the score. Seemed like there was only one song that was just chanting/screaming and loud deafening notes, which seemed to play every 15-20 minutes. Every time a big cgi shot came up and the music blared it felt like Denis screaming, ""Look how epic this is!!! Cool right?!?!?"" Felt a little, idunno... self-indulgent? Some of the audio mixing seemed poor in regards to dialogue as well.

Not gonna repeat everyone's sentiments on the lackluster script since I feel the same.",qd6vqv

There was at least 4 times in the theater that I thought to myself ""I could just as well just leave right now.""

The pacing is objectively horrible. If you want to see arthouse pacing done right, watch Twin Peaks season 3. This was just boring for at least 40% of the movie.

Lastly, that one part of a two-movie set should feel almost entirely like a setup, when this much action is actually happening was just too much for me get over.

No one hated it, we all liked bits of it, but I can't say it blew anyone away. I must admit I really like Lynch's Dune and having watched this version I still prefer it. I think it leans into the bombastic surrealism of its setting and gets away with its more outlandish concepts. Villeneuve tried to play the whole thing seriously and I'm not sure it works. There's a shot of someone riding a sandworm towards the end that just made me laugh out loud. It's just silly.

Anyway, most of us were just pissed we couldn't go watch part 2 immediately and I'm not sure if our enthusiasm for part one is going to last the two years we're probably going to have to wait for it.

While the remake paid homage to the original with an almost identical scene for scene take up until halfway through, it lacks the heart of the original. As much as my mom and I are fans of the cast in the remake, she enjoyed the original better as well.

Dune (1984) does in 2 hr 16 min what the remake didn’t get halfway through in its 2 hr 35 min run time. While both films have an amazing cast, the story is also better summed up in the original. If you want to do a deeper viewing dive, the Dune miniseries (2000) is what you’re looking for.

My Dune film/tv hierarchy so far is:
1) Dune (1984): great cast, pacing, and effective storytelling.
2) Dune miniseries (2000): the most film accurate adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel
3) Dune (2021): unfortunately chose style over substance. It looks pretty, but otherwise, meh.",qd6vqv

When I think of Duncan all I can think of is Momoa saying ""my boy"" constantly. I thought Jessica was supposed to be more calm and collected because of her Bene Geserit training. The Piter and Baron back and forth was non-existent. Overall I found the dialogue lacking. 
As a whole, it was really ambitious and the score tried to amp up the mood a lot. It looked great and was visually entertaining enough, but I just felt like they sorta missed on what made some of the characters great in the book. I also missed the traitor in the midst plot a lot. There wasn't enough deceit and cunning IMO. Overall it was fine, I'll see part two no doubt.",qd6vqv
hhkzl2b,"I never read the book nor seen any other movie versions. I did not much care for this movie. And I loved and I mean loved sicario and arrival. But this was just kinda of boring. The works building was neat, the cast was great, there just wasn't much story for me to latch on to here. It's strange in that the pacing felt both too fast and too slow. 

Like events would play out but not long enough for me to care. I was interested in how they would get the spice back up and running. Only they didn't and it all got blown up. Now the movie has like a reset where it needs to establish a whole new quest line. There is no macguffin to follow, no endgame to pursue. It's like watching the very start of a tv series with maybe 20 something episodes per season. 

Personally I would have changed the story here just a tiny bit. Used the visions, of which there were too many, to foreshadow the end. The whole time is trying to prevent the death of his father and become part of the locals. Just something to better connect each act in the film. Or end the movie with the attack on the city. This movie we got would have been better served as an HBO show. 

The last duel I feel like had a slow burn of a drama that took place over several years and it was better paced then this. Because you knew that the movie ended with the duel, it was easier to follow the story. Dune, for this non book reader, just kinda of meandered and didn't end up anywhere special....yet.",qd6vqv

Visually it was a spectacle, but I don’t care about any of the characters and barely care where any of it is going.  It felt like the whole thing was just a prologue to a story. Kind of like it was the first couple episodes of an HBO series I’m not fully on board with yet, but people keep saying, “stick with it until episode 4 trust me.”  I’m sure I’d watch the next one if they made it, but I don’t really care either way. 

I couldn’t shake how familiar aspects of it felt to me.  Clearly George Lucas ripped off aspects of the source material.  I imagine there are dune fans out there who hold this against Star Wars, but as someone whose only exposure to dune is this movie, my limited perspective has me thinking George Lucas deserves credit for mining aspects of Dune and building a world and story far more interesting and entertaining with characters far more likable and moments far more delightful.

I had a similar reaction recently watching “The Green Knight”. Another visually spectacular movie that was epic and brilliantly shot, but an overall confusing experience with a lead I didn’t care about and a dull ending.

The visuals are in service to a captivating story and layered characters you’re actually invested in. That was missing in Dune, which felt quite empty on the inside.

But in doing so it lost the interiority of the characters which is so key to a story like Dune all the while saddling yourself with a story where all the key characters - unless you're already invested in them from the books - are basically inaccessible since the thing that made them accessible - their internal thoughts/narration - can't be translated into film. If I didn't read the book, why would I care about Paul and Jessica beyond the fact that they're the protags of this story? Like, what is compelling about their journeys in this film? Because until Dune 2 happens, we can only judge them by Dune 1 and there's nothing to judge them by.


Hell, they even removed the bits of the first half of the book that would have been emotionally compelling. The bit between Jessica and Leto, the dynamic between them, is reduced to very little and the scene of 'I should have married you' has nothing to ground it in. How about between Paul and Leto where it's hinted that Paul can see his father faltering, and honestly you had a great set up to it with the trailer scene where the Bene Gesserit tells Paul that his dad is done for.


This movie felt like a 2.5hr long expo montage prelude to a more interesting film that may never be made. For me it became better in the last 30-45 minutes, but that's a little too late for me. Also, why is Jessica crying so much? I think I counted 4 different scenes in which she cried, that's a weird choice on the part of the actor and the director.



And yeah, not being accurate to the source material is obviously bad, but a copy&paste job without taking advantage of the tools a movie allows you - and this isn't confined to the visual aspect but also the differences in storytelling between a book and a movie - is also bad as well.",qd6vqv

So much time is spent explaining how the universe works, without it serving the story. Everyone can understand that a suit protects you from the environment, I don't need an entire scene dedicated to it. They introduce completely new off worlds just for showing one or two scenes.

There are many characters but they are not given time to breathe. I think you see Yueh twice with Paul and Jessica. When he later betrays Leto it's probably meant to be a big thing, but I don't know anything about the relationship and history between them. I've hardly been given time to care about Leto, let alone about the wife of some doctor.

In the latter half of the movie we spend more time with Paul and Jessica, but it still felt the pacing of the movie was weird. Paul has a vision every two minutes. The music does its thing and all. But the magic of those moments is long gone by then. I'm sure in the book the these moments are way more important. But in the movie there is so little in between them the dreams felt like a annoying distraction. I want to feel these characters but you're not letting me. Imagine if Frodo would put on the ring every other scene...

I'm no movie critic or anything, but I did notice I just wasn't taken by the story and the characters, even though I wanted to. For me they could have skipped the first part of the movie entirely. Just start with the arrival on Arrakis, follow Paul more closely. Compress his visions in bigger chunks. Don't try to make me care for 10 different people.

hjdrzp0,"As someone who knew nothing about Dune going into it, it was an incredibly dissatisfying movie. Nothing happened, it was all setup. The trailer made it seem like it would be a much more cool sci fi with battles and tension. But all the cool stuff was just visions.

Even if that’s not Dune, I am of the philosophy that even movies in a series should each have their own contained stories. This movie would be as if Hunger Games ended at the beginning of the game part. Just a setup for another movie. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had waited for the whole series and watched them back to back.",qd6vqv

hhuay6p,"Why do I feel this noticeable trend of films getting a pass just because they’re pretty to look at?  Ignoring things like a pretty dull plot and a cast full of flat characters.

Overall I found Dune interesting.  The sound design and cinematography are the only thing I would say are unquestionably great.  Everything else left me feeling empty.  By the time the credits rolled I had one thought.  Is that it?  The film was one giant set-up.  Which is a bad thing only because I’m not in any rush to see what happens next.  Tbh I really don’t care all that much.  So considering this is a part 1 that means the film was a failure for me.",qd6vqv

hhruam7,Watching this movie was a torturous experience,qd6vqv
hhtvjnd,"This was the movie equivalent of “Yasss! Give us nothing!”

I completely understand the “show, don’t tell” rule, but with heavy sci-fi elements it’s very, very easy to get lost in all of the intricacies of the universe. I did not understand anything about any of the factions in the film besides “these are the good guys because they’re good, these are bad guys because they’re bad”. Like I said, yassssss give us nothing. Why is any of this happening? It’s like we’re on the second episode of a brand new tv series and we’ve completely missed the pilot. You need to carefully walk the viewers through their first time with such a content rich series. This did not feel very welcoming to Dune newbies like myself. I want to know why people love this series so much, take as much time as you need to catch me up with everything I need to know. Don’t waste that time on slow-mo inserts of sand, use the long runtime to your advantage. 

The pacing of this film was mediocre at best. I completely understand the need to hang on beautiful shots, but after the 17th slo-mo of Zendaya’s face I was very annoyed. We get it, let’s move on already. Every time I felt like the movie finally found it’s footing and the plot was moving forward, we’d cut to another dream sequence or literally just sand blowing in the wind, bringing us to another standstill. 

They could have cut a good 30-45 minutes of this movie and it would have been much better for it. I found myself looking at my watch and being shocked we still had more movie left to go. I feel like so little happened, like we just watched only the first act of a story. And yeah, I get it. This is “part one” and they’re making a sequel. But why not make each film work on their own? This film literally does not have an ending.

Another thing that really annoyed me is how little character development we got with just about anyone. Like I said earlier, I cannot tell you the purpose behind anything that either side is doing. You’re telling me this is one of the best pieces of science fiction? I wouldn’t have gotten that idea if I only knew of the series from this film. For a series so well known for its world building, this adaptation really lacked in that department. 

Speaking of characters, there’s a couple major characters that seemingly disappear at some point in this film and are never seen again. I didn’t have any closure on their characters. They either died off screen or they were completely forgotten about. In my eyes, both of those options are the same.

I will say that this film had a beautiful color palette. All of the ships and vehicles were incredible to look at. They all fit so well into this world. As to be expected, I adore the sand worms and Fremen culture. The score was immaculate, I can’t wait to listen to it by itself. It goes without saying, this was one of the most beautifully shot films in recent memory. So many shots could be actual works of art. A lot of the shots of the chaos in the invasion were just stunning. This was such a pretty film.

I also think that the sense of scale is done so wells I loved every single shot we’re we see those huge ships and you see people standing beside them. One of the best uses of this is when we see people near the sand crawler. You know the size of that object compared to a person, then later on you see this massive beast eat that sand crawler with ease. Incredible use of scope and scale. I wish I saw it in IMAX for that very reason (hell, I might need to go see it again just for that) 

I want to be very clear that I don’t think this is a bad film at all, I just acknowledge it’s not for me and I am leaving this here to explain why. I’m just so critical on it because of how much I want to like it. This is another classic case of “I’m not mad, I’m disappointed.” There is the potential that this series could win me over with a good sequel that give me more of what I truly want: good characters and a good story. 

I thought the action (as little of it as we got) was cool I guess. It lacked any real direction though. It was just a visual feast and nothing more. Completely style over substance. I wanted to like this movie so much more. I can’t say I hate it, I’m just very disappointed. But I’m sure everyone is going to love this movie and I’m going to sound like a negative Nancy like usual.",qd6vqv
hhxmlga,This movie was so incredibly dull. And the end was so entirely unsatisfying,qd6vqv
hknn0i2,"2/10, pure garbage. 

Before fans of the IP get triggered, learn this: it should not take prior knowledge about the books, the earlier movie, the game, or any other contextual piece of media to enjoy Dune (2021). A film should speak for itself. I don't care about the books. I went into this movie knowing nothing about Dune beforehand, and came out with a regretful waste of 2 and a half hours. 

This movie makes absolutely no effort to connect with its audience. It's an *arrogant* film, that's the best way I can put it. It assumes the audience will either piece things together or stay in the dark, and it doesn't care if people stay in the dark. It's not interested in telling a story, it's interested in basking in its own glow. ""Look at me; I am Dune 2021, and if you don't worship me, you're wrong"" is the attitude I got from this film. You know that one guy who always starts a sentence with a condescending ""you DO know that (x) = (y) *right?""* If Dune could be a dude, it would be that dude. Arrogant, uncooperative and inevitably unpleasant. 

The movie grapples with a lot of concepts but insists on doing nothing to distill them. What boils down to a very simple plot is stunted beyond measure by colossal lore dumps, ham-fisted messages and completely unnecessary misdirection. Even when it does explain things, we get context with clunky, hard-to-hear exposition dialogue (why the fuck is everyone either whispering, mumbling or screaming?) that drags on far longer than it has any right to. I felt like I was watching a PBS history documentary from a high school classroom. So astronomically dull. There's something wrong with the dialogue audio. I legitimately could not fathom what these characters were saying half the time (and it did not help that many speakers kept slipping in and out of a completely different language mid-sentence, the English was hard enough to listen to but when this happened I just gave up). None of the actors bother with any degree of enunciation. I legitimately thought the MC's name was ""Po"" because of how everyone was talking with the least amount of effort possible. 

This film could've been much tighter, much more efficient and still maintained the ethereal feel it was going for. But the filmmakers were not interested in making that effort. Not interested in making the story deliverable. Which is why I call this arrogant. 

Prioritization problem: this movie clearly favors spectacle over story. The first couple of 3-minute-long CGI sweeping shots were impressive, but when that keeps happening for the entirety of the film, something's up. Spectacle will not impress if there's no meat on the bones. The meat is the story, and it's abysmally told. Visual and musical spectacle is icing on the cake, it's not what sells your film. You're not painting, you're not conducting; you are telling a story. This was so poorly told that I found myself asking ""wait, where are they and what are they doing?"" even though I hadn't stopped paying attention at any point. 

I know everyone wants to hold up this movie on a pedestal because it's got this ""prestigious"" air surrounding it, and people are tired of superhero movies dominating cinema, but do not make the mistake of assuming Dune is a good film, it is not. Look past the bells and whistles, forget the so-called A-list actors who brought NONE of their game to their roles, forget how good it **looks** and how good the soundtrack is, focus on how the story was told and you will see how amateur it is. 

I gave it 2/10 instead of 0 because it deserves something for the visuals and the score. But that's it. Waste of my goddamn time.",qd6vqv
hhmwu5u,"Gonna get downvoted (or ignored). Aesthetically it’s great, soundtrack usage is overbearing but ok. But in every single other aspect, the original movie is better. Script is better, pacing is better, intensity is better, the plot is cohesive and nothing feels irrelevant. Why was this movie made if they weren’t going to innovate? I understand people going into this movie without reading the books or seeing the original movie, and liking it. But the source material is too good for it. All of this production time, talent and investment, and it still doesn’t justify itself. 

The fact that the runtime is so stretched out for just a two part story is underwhelming too. Characters felt really underdeveloped and somehow other scenes feel like they lack context, as if several cuts were made. I don’t mind scenes being drawn out, but this just felt wasteful.

That being said, costumes and visual effects were great, even though that is the case with every big budget movie these days.",qd6vqv
hho0hkn,"Going against the grain here . I just didn't enjoy this film . The story was super basic, I had no time to understand or care about any of the characters or houses.
The score was way too overwhelming making it louder does not make it better . It seemed to fizzle out instead of climax, like you go from major battle to a 1v1 with a character you just met and don't care about.

I feel like I need a lot more time with these characters in order to care about them . The whole thing was like style over substance to me.",qd6vqv

hhl61dn,"I enjoyed the movie and plan to see it again, but I feel they really dropped the ball on Jessica who is easily my favorite character in the books.  She was basically simpering the whole movie.   Also I don't feel like the importance and behavior of the spice or the sacredness of water was conveyed well.   

Definitely a hard story to tell.  But c'mon...maybe 5 less shots of Zendaya's face could have bought the time for some creative exposition.",qd6vqv
hhl9l0r,"I think this is a wonderfully made movie which set out to do the impossible - and, well, it remains impossible. At least in the current Hollywood machinery.

I applaud Villeneuve, his work here is top-notch. Visuals, design, the epic worldbuilding and the feel of the scale, it's all great. 

It's just the fucking script, and it feels like it's the best you could do in the runtime. I still think that the only way to make this into a good film is to remove the length limit for this, and let it be 6, 7, 10 hours long. If this same movie, with the same team and filmmaking had that opportunity, i think this would have been absolutely phenomenal, and among the all-time great sci-fi epics (movies).

Scenes felt like montages, they kept happening one after the other, without any connecting bits, or quiet moments. And I get it, because _so much_ is happening. A victim of its short length. And they sorta managed to do a 3-act thing, but in reality it was just two acts. The fight at the end doesn't qualify as an act in itself, it just felt like it because of the incredible filmmaking and the earporn crescendos.

A script criticism I'd have is that the flash-forward visions started becoming annoying at some point, when they actually started speaking and giving life advice. Felt like the movie was taking shortcuts. It also felt a bit like Arrival, with the character learning about life through visions of the future.


Also - All that trailer shots. They teased us about the extent this movie goes to by using all those flash-forward visions. :(

Sidenote, I think this is the first time in Villeneuve's filmography that I was able to look at the movie and just go ""yep, that's a Denis film alright"". Not saying it's a bad thing but it feels like his signature is all over this one.",qd6vqv
hhlai88,"Does anyone else think Timothy C is just a bad actor? I don’t know how his character is portrayed in the books, but the scene in the tent killed his character for me. Almost no emotion after his father and almost everyone he’s ever known had been blown away. Literally the only thing he “cried” about in the tent was about how his mom turned him into a freak with the voice and the visions. Seriously?

Then he finally meets up with the girl he’s been dreaming about for years and doesn’t even flinch. 

The only emotion he showed in the entire movie was when Idaho sacrificed himself. Which he didn’t mention or think about at all after it was done. 

Am I crazy here? He was stone faced the entire time. Seemed like a waste to have such an emotional story filled with betrayal, nobility, honor, etc and then have the main character not react to any of it. Is it the same way in the books?",qd6vqv

One thing about Denis Villeneuve that always blows me away - especially in his sci-fi movies - is the way he’s able to portray scale and weight. 

When the ships are taking off or when the city was being attacked you really felt the size of these objects. I felt the same about BR2049 and Arrival too, it adds so much and really grounds his films.

8/10 - excited for the next one and I might have to read the books now!",qd6vqv

I've never read the books and she has.  We both found the movie clunky and boring.  We both love Jason Mamoa but felt he was wrong for Duncan.  The body shield usefulness was inconsistent.

* Mixed on the score. Really liked what Zimmer did for the Bene Gesserit, but not a huge fan of the chanting
* Dr. Yueh deserved a few more scenes. I get that the movie is already pretty cramped, but it would've fleshed out the characters if the ""who's the traitor"" subplot was added
* Got a little tired of the Chani visions and the bulls
* For the non-readers, I think there's a lot of hinting but not a lot of explaining",qd6vqv

Pacing felt a little off. I haven't read the books. Only seen the 1980s film and the Syfy mini series. I got the impression despite breaking this up into two films and probably ~5 hours, Denis had to cut some important stuff. Movie seemed a little rush and out of rhythm in several parts.

hhshz29,"\*spoilers ahead\*

Dune was one of my favorite stories growing up, so to see it given such a reverent, true-to-the-text treatment by an absolute master in Denis Villeneuve was literally one of the greatest moviegoing experiences of my life, up there with seeing Star Wars or Fellowship of the Ring for the first time in theaters.  

I saw it in Imax last night on about 20ug of LSD and 30mg of edibles. That was absolutely the way to see this movie.  Besides the sound and scale of the movie being so overwhelming, the way that the sand and spice were used to obscure or reveal new details or transition between Paul's visions was perfect, and exactly how I felt the story should have been told.  Paul's sight was one of the aspects of the book that I felt was hard to get across, and even though they didn't directly address it so much with words yet, they've definitely laid the foundation.

The scene on Caladan with the signing ceremony basically sucked me into the movie with its grandeur and I never got taken out of it at all after that.  Seeing the size of everything. The richness of everybody. The costume design. My theater was dead silent during the movie and incredibly quiet walking out, like we had all just been through something we had never experienced before.

The Bene Gesserit's involvement and their persona was incredible.  Hans Zimmer using whispers and a female chorus to show their comings and goings was inspired; hearing the ladies in other songs as well to let us know that even though they weren't fighting, they were still influencing.  I love that the movie got this right, because if people cringe about that, they're not going to buy into anything else that happens later in the story.  Paul's first use of the voice with Jessica was really effective.  His outburst later on was amazing.  The Gom Jabbar scene had all the gravitas that it needed.  Rebecca Ferguson crushed it in every way possible.  I was 100% bought in on her relationship to the BG and to Paul, and how much was revealed to Paul about what she knew ahead of time. 

The worm scenes were super amazing. The first one especially to show its scale, and definitely Liet Kynes' sign-off where she says ""I serve only one master. His name is Shai Hulud"" and starts beating the sand.  Really incredible to see in Imax with the Zimmer score again. 

Scenes involving Leto and the Baron were all really interesting with regards to exposition. Emphasizing how much wealth and power the Harkonnens had amassed while they were in control of Arrakis, and how little they left behind, just to show how bad of a position the Atreides' were in by moving there. How much luxury they had and how separated they were from the people. 

The Sardaukar scene on Salusa Secundus was a great touch that wasn't 100% necessary to show, but I really appreciated.  

Things that I noticed which were missing

* Leto only had one line about Jessica's choice to have a boy instead of a girl. Jessica didn't have a real one-on-one with the reverend mother and they didn't have a flashback to explain like they did in the book.  So I wonder if they'll talk more about that in part 2.
* The spy within the Atreides house that people were aware of.  I didn't really mind them removing that plot thread, but I'm sure some other fans did.  I think they already gave us enough dread before the fall that it wasn't really required tonally, but I wonder if Gurney confronting Jessica later on will have as much of an impact this way.  
* The water offering to the people at the gates of the palace in Arrakeen.  I didn't notice this while I was watching it, but it might be a slight missing piece.  Leto got his chance to show that he was different during the rescue, but Jessica never got to distinguish herself directly to the people.  Maybe there was a scene that I'm forgetting about that showed that.

Anyway, one of the most memorable movies I can remember seeing in my life.  I will give it a 9.8/10 because if there's ever an extended cut of this movie, I want to give that version some extra room for growth.  But yeah, I got pulled in early and it never really let me go for the entire movie.  I adored it. So happy that DV had the chance to do this and really knocked it out of the park.",qd6vqv

Since so much of the conflict rests on the idea that the Emperor did something highly iffy by giving his support to the Harkonnens, the whole plot is cheapened quite a bit by not letting the Saudakar look capable of doing much more than sneaking up behind people real good.",qd6vqv

I'd liken it to Warhammer 40k, visually striking with so much world building I want to get lost in it but there's simply not enough time to do it in one sitting.

A Game of Thrones type series would have been perfect to really flesh out the politics and include the AWESOME battles, not to mention killing everybody.

Not because it’s lacking in quality from a technical perspective, but because the narrative is almost all setup for a sequel that might not even happen.

Film the whole thing all at once, then release 1 year apart.  

Now we end up having to wait like 3 years for the sequel.  Like a lot of people said, the film itself as a stand alone hurts by being mostly exposition and set up for the latter half and when it ends like this, it leaves the viewers a little unsatisfied.  If people knew going in the sequel was only 1 year away the hype could build immensely, but now the gap is too long, and any hype will die down again before coming back. 


If they didn't film it all at once because the studio didn't want to take that risk, then the fact they had so little faith in the DUNE IP and Denis Villeneuve really shows how poor the leadership is at WB",qd6vqv

It's a visual masterpiece, it's poetry to my eyes, the production value was superb (and this movie cost less than Black Widow!) The story is a slow-burn, but its presentation is amazing and the world building is incredible; I was engaged since the first few minutes.

I had heard that it was a long movie and it could be boring, but halfway through the movie I didn't care about the runtime and actually didn't want the movie to end quick.

I have never read Dune and the trailers seemed fine, but that was it. I can say now that I loved this movie, and that I was speechless by the end of it. Denis Villeneuve did it again! This was amazing 10/10",qd6vqv

I'm not talking about terraforming it. I know that would kill the desert and then the worms and then the spice.

But take some of their 20-storey-high-half-mile-long landing craft and convert them to water carriers. A Fremen uses a thimble of water a day? So three gallons would be a *lot* to them, right? An Olympic swimming pool holds 660,000 gallons. Even if one of those ships can carry only one such pool, you can use five of them to bring three million gallons of water from any planet with an ocean to Arrakis and land them at strategic points for the Fremen to make free use off. Do it every few months, and the people will never want for water again. Mine spice with their help and you're golden.",qd6vqv

If it's like 3D many years ago, where only a handful of movies were well worth it for 3D, it felt like this movie was made for 4DX at times.

The scene where the bad dudes invade (harkaans?) and ships are blowing up everywhere.. the explosions and movements with the camera was very interesting.  Fight scenes felt fun with the seats, especially the scene with Jason Mamoa's character (where he gets stabbed), a massage rod in the chair pokes you in the back when he got stabbed.. and it was great.

The entire scene with the ship in the sand storm,  the chairs were shaking all over the place and really felt like i was in that cockpit a few times.

hhlffoj,"I've seen the film in IMAX and had a wonderful experience. Denis Villaneuve makes another great film in Dune (Part One). His directing brought out the book's characters through the actors. Rebecca Ferguson would no doubt be in the running for best supporting actress in many award ceremonies. She gave Lady Jessica an emotional touch that made the character sympathetic. 

The cinematography is worth the price of admission alone. Scenes are shot in wide angles and closeups are detailed and enrapturing. Zendaya has never looked so good on screen, and she's in the film for 3 minutes. Arakis feels alive on screen. 

As someone who is currently reading the first book, there were some details I felt the film should not have omitted like the history of the universe. For instance, the Butlerian Jihad, Pitr's desire for Lady Jessica, a secret lineage, an Harkonnen nephew, and Paul's recital of the litany would have added to the film's lore and emotional moments. 

Dune is a true epic of the sense and Villeneuve did not hold back. The acting, story, cinematography and directing are among the best examples from films for this year. I recommend that this movie be seen in IMAX where possible for the best experience.",qd6vqv

It felt very slow moving in parts which to be fair lines up with how the book feels, the development of the Atreides + Idaho and Baron Harkonnen were pretty good but everyone else felt a bit lacking. Although Paul’s jump from “I don’t want to lead” to “I’m going to lead the desert people as their messiah” felt a tad rushed.

Visually and audibly stunning though. Especially audibly, the score and the effects are brilliant. Pacing just feels off and feels like it ends at a frustrating point.",qd6vqv

I actually think the movie pulled it off more that Paul is sort of a scared young man at first, unsure of his duty and role. But my God I was so frustrated when it ended, because I knew what was to come and I was so immersed. It did not end on where I thought it would end up the first half. I thought it was pretty faithful to the book, if anyone should of got more development it was Yueh, and I know the cut out some subplots but the ones they cut are OK I feel.

For instance, Duncan's ""fight like demons"" line in the trailer is said ""let's fight like demons"" as like a low energy call to action. It sounded super awkward to me. In the film, he actually says ""they fight like demons"" describing the fighting prowess of the Freman.  Absolutely nothing wrong with the line.

As a book reader, loved the movie. Would have liked a little extra focus on the paranoia of who the traitor might have been. An extra scene with Yueh, Jessica, Thufir might help coil the spring of tension and make the eventual betrayal hit harder.",qd6vqv

hhn8xz7,"A good movie. As someone who watched on HBO Max, I think the spectacle was good throughout. Sometimes there's stuff that looks good to me in theaters but awful once I watch it at home, but I have a feeling if I saw this in the theater, the visuals would just jump from a 9 to a 10. The story was decent but hard to follow at times, because of all the different lore that gets name-dropped, but in the end it's easy enough to comprehend. You have bad guys, good guys, and the 3rd-party ~~forest~~ desert people that could help or hurt you depending on how things go. The movie didn't feel too long, but I was taking breaks so that's to be expected. Overall I highly recommend checking out this new, different take on a sci-fi distant future. I don't think this movie will make Dune into the next major sci-fi franchise like SW/ST, but hopefully it can at least satisfy fans of the series, who I know have been wanting a good Dune movie for many years. 

That said, I do think the ""white savior"" element people have been complaining about is very real, but I've also heard there's more to this story that we're not seeing just yet. If you're a person of color, you may have a problem with this movie's racial divide - I wasn't sure how to feel about it, but IMO it kind of makes sense with the way the different factions are set up. So overall I didn't feel bothered by how things went.",qd6vqv

But I wonder how much non-book readers understood mentats, Suk doctor training, the Landsraad, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, Missionaria Protectiva, the weirding way, the spice, etc. In fact, there a few things that weren't even mentioned at all in the movie, like the Butlerian Jihad, the Holtzman Effect, and the interaction between shields and lasgun.

I'm assuming they're saving a lot of exposition for the sequel. But I wonder if there are some thing they'll expand on at all, like the OCB, Zensunni and how religions in Dune are sort of a mix of different religions of today.

As for some of the complaints I had. The fighting was kind of weird. Maybe it's the PG-13 rating but it didn't feel like they were making contact in some of those bigger fights. It's like that brawl between the police and Bane's goons in TDKR where it looked like they were fake fighting.

The shield combat was also inconsistent. I'm pretty sure that Duncan was moving fast in some of those Sardukar kills. 

And the weirding way was pretty unimpressive. People using the weirding way are supposed to move at supernatural speed. But Jessica was kind of just moving at normal speed when she disarmed Stilgar.

But overall, the complaints are easy to ignore and I was very impressed by everything else, the visuals, acting, music, worldbuilding, etc.",qd6vqv

Missed the Harkonnen brutality and aggression, as well as a wider political view. Like, no scene with the emperor and navigator scheming? The Bene Gesserit part was well made imo, but it was weird to see Paul acting as the chosen one from the first third of the movie. And Jessica taking a 180 becoming a caring mother and wife trying to get Paul off Arrakis into safety after spending all her life manipulating history from the shadows in service of a higher power and sacral goal. Gonna wait till part 2 until I take all these as missing parts/opportunities, because I love Villeneuve's art style and this was still the best scenery and world building since Blade Runner 2049 in a similarly unforgiving saga.

So the Emperor was working with the Baron to setup Leto and wipe out his house because he threatened the Emperor's power? Even though the Baron's power and wealth had already  grew to match the Emperor? I thought it was weird that Emperor could just tell them to leave and they just did.     
     
I thought it was out of no where that the Dr guy betrayed Duke and his family. Did I miss any bits about his wife being captured or missing?

We didn’t get to see much of the Guild navigators or the inside of a Highliner. They just appear at Arrakis.

I didn’t like the casting of Liet Kynes. Her acting was quite stiff, IMO. Also, in the book. Kynes’s death was a lot more impactful and dramatic, the movie death was not quite the same. 

Kynes’s terraforming goals were also kinda pushed aside?

Also not a fan of certain aspects of the score, such as the bagpipes and the Freman chanting song/clip that played a lot during Paul’s scenes. The Freman chanting song just seemed a little generic, and it was played multiple times throughout the movie in dramatic scenes.",qd6vqv

hhrv978,"So I'm kinda having an issue with the traitor subplot because it feels like it shouldn't be possible.

I watched this film in IMAX, Dolby Cinema, and 3D. 3D often suffers from fidelity loss, especially in dimly lit scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised that fidelity was not an issue at all for *Dune*! Unfortunately, the issue is that there wasn't much to be gained other than a higher ticket price: The 3D was generally hardly noticeable as there weren't many scenes with things flying towards the camera.

As usual, Dolby Cinema was my favorite for the best image and sound quality, along with rumbling seats that actually aren't gimmicks. One potentially nice thing about IMAX is that a packed auditorium has so much more people so if you're looking for audience reactions, IMAX is probably better.",qd6vqv

hhyhp9e,"Very ballsy of Villeneuve to end the film like that and I'm honestly shocked the studio let him to do it. 

People have made Fellowship of the Ring comparisons re: the ending, but I really don't think that is apt. Fellowship of the Ring was its own book and it has a denouement that makes you feel that you've reached the end of an installment in a trilogy. 

In contrast, this movie is completely literal when it says ""Part 1"" at the beginning. It's filmed like Part 1 of a single movie and you've just reached the intermission. The way it ends, you expect to be back in 15 minutes to watch the rest. There's no denouement. It's a bold choice and I don't think there is any comparison that can be made to other big budget multi-film franchises.

Anyways, I think the movie was great.",qd6vqv
hhyhzsz,"This was such a great film. Everything from the acting to the visuals to just how well it communicated really robust lore without bogging the viewer down.

Its greatest flaw is that it's half a film. It doesn't really build towards or have a climax, per se, and the stopping point is similar to the ending of *The Two Towers* but without the comfort of knowing you'll be able to see the next chapter anytime soon. Which leaves it in a really weird state.

In the end, it just felt like some scenes are building to things that aren't there. Like the whole long section at the research station... it almost felt like it could've been cut out if not for Duncan and Dr. Kynes's sacrifice.

Feels like it'll be the greatest thing ever once we get the next film(s) and any potential director's cuts factored in, but it's still an amazing ride as-is.",qd6vqv
hhyie6m,"When Paul saw the vision of the wars to come, I'm bummed that they used the term ""religious holy war"" and not ""jihad"". I think using the word would have given the vision a darker undertone because of our real world history.

I know they don't want to use that word... Either to be more sensitive to Muslim viewers or to be more widely marketable to broader audiences. But they need to use the word!!",qd6vqv
hhz4r8k,"(I read the first two books like 10 years ago, loved them, but didn't find them an easy read) Loooved the movie. Saw it in Imax in 3D, but becasue there was some technical issues at the cinema we had a half hour long pause in screening around the attack on the city, which killed the vibe, but well... Anyway, the ending gave me such blueballs I actually decided to see it again in different theatre (with Dolby Atmos) the next day. I think I've never seen the same movie twice in theathers before... But it was totally worth it. The scope and tension were immaculte, the story honours the original material so much. I'm so thankful they didn't cheapen this story with forced humour where there was none (khy khy Star Wars). The cast did amazing. It all had such a Hamlet-y vibe. Timothee killed it, he portayed the broody teenager turning man turning messiah without being obnoxious (Kylo Ren could never). I liked how at the beginning Jessica looked like she couldn't handle the fact that Paul becomes more powerful, out of fear as his mother and as Bene Gesserit, but when it comes to it (the copther scene when they were kidnapped) she is such a badass while coming to terms with letting Paul lead. Mamoa portrayal of Duncan was fun and refreshing, sad he had to die. Oscar Issac oozes regality, 100% convinving as Leto.  

Since I saw it with subtitles and know the original, the names weren't much on an issue - an unexpected advantage as I see quite a lot of people complaining about it. When it comes to accessibility to the newcomers, my friends said they didn't understand only why the spice was such a big deal and had to deduce why nobody was using firearms. I wish they had somehow explained that aspect of this world, as well as mentats, since it robs the story from the economical impact of spice. 

In my Imax the sound wasn't too loud fortunately, the 3D aspects I think were really nice, especially seeing the spice in the air and the scope of landscapes during the battles. In the Dolby Atmos theater the sound was a bit better, the bass of the Voice and explosions shook the seats, so awesome. But I do recommend seeing it at the biggest screen you have avaliable, in this sense the Imax one was better.  

Not filming the second half would be a literal crime.",qd6vqv

Didn't really care for the main character too much. 

Side characters were very very well done.

Cinematically was great, story felt like I was missing a bunch of backstory. (makes sense for book to movie adaptations so I wasn't too surprised by that)

Tried reading the book before watching the movie, but the first 10-20 pages introduced so many names/characters it just felt like too much. Don't think the movie helped in that regard, but I think I will go back and read it.

I'm not a fan of Timothee Chamalet and imo he felt bland. But Villeneuve has such a great eye. Yes, of course it felt incomplete and I knew going in that this was ""part 1."" It felt parallel to a Lord of the Rings space adventure but just not as tightly written.

I've seen Lynch's film and the TV series as a kid... rewatching Lynch's flick now. I just may try to read the book to seal the holes.

1 why did house a take charge even though they knew it was a trap in the 1st place. Why did the transition team not have a 3rd party like the spacing guild to oversee the process change hands. How long did house a go from landing on dune to being attacked?

Considering it was deemed an unfilmable novel I have to say that this is one of the most visually stunning movies that I have ever seen. Just breathtaking in almost every scene, the cast were as perfect as they looked on paper and the score was Hans Zimmer’s best in some time.

I feel that this movie was an awesome cinematic experience, the cinematography, world design, sound and music was awesome but i think it lacks something when it comes to the story/plot and feeling like a nice complete ""solo"" film. When it finished i was there sitting thinking ""that was it? i want to watch more!!"", it so obviously feels like half a movie, i hope the second movie is even more epic and closes it all in a nice way. It feels like it would work better as an HBO series.

Also, it was hard for the first 30 minutes getting used to all the new names and races and planets and stuff, but i got most of it by the half of the movie although at some points i could not understand a lot of the dialog since the otherwise great sound/music was way too loud plus the characters seemed to whisper a lot at times.

Also i get the feeling they should have shown better how hot it really is and why those suits are needed to survive. Paul was walking out there as a pale dude pretty nicely as far as i could see.

hjn6g9f,"It's interesting how Dune would inspire Stuff like Star Wars and 40 years later when it's finally possible to get Dune right, the tone and aesthetics gets inspired from those movies. Full Circle and all.

It's an amazing good space opera at that. I'm concerned that if the next ones don't follow the hype it might age bad. But so far it's great. The Epicness of it, reminiscent of how something like LOTR or the OT felt back in the day.

The story does have the problem of coming out in 2021, where people have seen already over 200 histories that were inspired by stuff like Dune before watching Dune. Time will tell.

I do think it's a missed opportunity to update/focus the commentary/parallels the story has with real life history. But since it's an ongoing saga, I will reserve judgement until we see more.",qd6vqv

Also in the book the harkonnen used old school artillery to fight the atreides and force some into caves. In the movie they show what looks like artillery slowly penetrating the shield barriers. That's impossible according to the canon as thats why shields made old school artillery useless in the first place. The harkonnen just managed to use them as a surprise reaction method to push back the atreides troops.",qd6vqv
hju5lzo,So i made sure to read to book up until where the movie covers before seeing it and i have to say im happy with the movie but i wish there were some parts that were added. i felt like the dinner scene was really needed along with a bigger sense of water on the planet. i know there were a few small things about water but i feel like it should have been pushed abit more with it being a massive point in the book up until where I've read. i felt like the whole traitor subplot was missing aswell when it was revealed it was yueh i feel like it didnt hit as much as it could have when you have the whole plot of him not being suspected at all due to his conditioning.,qd6vqv

I do wish they’d leaned in a bit harder, but it’s excellent. They did a great job with the exposition; it wasn’t always perfect but sci-fi often just requires exposition dumps to understand and it was done great here. My gf had no prior exposure to Dune and she was able to follow along. I don’t think it’s as complicated a story as people think.

The only thing she had an issue with is understanding Jessica’s powers and the motives of the Bene Gesserit, which I realize now I don’t quite understand myself. But I filled her in as best I could and she gets it.

For some reason, even though I’ve read the book maybe 4-5 times, I always forget that Duncan Idaho dies like halfway through. I always imagine he survives somehow but it surprised me every time.",qd6vqv

And also during the fight, his mom closed her eyes as Paul killed Jamis in an almost upset manner because she wanted Jamis to go down that scary road or did she just close her eyes in relief? 
Paul ends up killing Jamis so I interpreted that as he was too scared of going down the path where he is reborn. Or is that just wrong?",qd6vqv

How would in the year 10191 a feudal society develop such technological level? or the tribal people of Arrakis... the Fremen... Is the movie in tune with the novel? If so, the novel of Frank Herbert is forgettable.

It is all baloney! Faux spiritual or philosophical depth. No even entertaining since mega action scenes is all what is being shown in movies. As for the special effects, they are good, but nothing extraordinary.

I watched the movie in an standard 2D theater, and I think the movie would better served in an IMAX or a 3D theater. I have to debate with myself if it will be worth to go to watch the second part... or the third... or the full saga for that case. Because I think that's the business model.

hhkw3nl,"The movie was great, it had a good pacing and never a slow moment **but that was its demise.**

The whole movie happens so fast that it feels like recap of something, like if the narrator is reading you a resume of the book and because of that there’s no momentum to build or a final showdown, like I’m sure that the scene with the helicopters and the worm could have been done better with more drama but it happens fast or the moment they siege the city, they kill and bomb and leave and you just have no time to process or see people try to fight/escape because the movie is running and they ‘kill’ Duncan, Josh Brolin and then there you are in the helicopter with Jessica and Paul.

The final battle with Paul and Jasia could have been done more dramatic or grandiesque and yet they put some visions and Paul wins and they move on like where’s the momentum or something to build? I kept thinking of the SW movies or the Mad Max FR and and the whole movies always build to the final act but here it feels kinda plain/flat, maybe because it’s on the second half of the first book like it happened to Hunger Games 3, Part 1 was flat but Part 2 was great 👍🏽.

The political intrigue is gone.. the awe of how the fremen mind and culture work is gone.. the extreme weather of Arrakis is talked about but not really experienced, and one could leave the theatre without really getting or remembering the dire importance of water. Time that should have been given to flesh out the characters was used on excessive stylish “epic” shots and never-ending music.. This is on the surface faithful to parts of the plot of the book, or rather sections of it, but the meaning, the subtext is barely tackled :/",qd6vqv
hhq13wr,"Personally, I fucking LOVED this movie. Every scene has at least one shot that could be a desktop and the feel of the universe seems so true to the lore. I read the novel recently for the first time (long before this movie was announced) and it feels like a shot-for-shot of the book.   


One thing I loved about it was the fact that all the cultures we see (Atriedes, Harkonnen, Sardukar, Arrakean and Freman (and sorry if I spelt any of those incorrectly!)) is that they all FEEL different. Like the distance between them and the time that's past since their founding has made them go on vastly different paths.   


Harkonnen androgyny mixed with its more insectile stylings gives them a menacing but not inherently evil feel to them. The ritual we see the Sardukar troops going through, complete with just barely discordant throat singing (it starts and stops in weird places, almost like it's being played in reverse), makes them feel more like a barbarian horde of legend than a deeply militaristic society bred for war.   


And the technology on show is stunning. The 'crusher' bombs that hit the Atriedes ships during the battle sequence, and the fact we see an explosion momentarily contained by the active shield, were amazing to see in action. The appearance and devastation caused by the Las-weaponry is both terrifying and brilliant. Instead of the traditional bright 'beam', we see something that like when a laser-pen looks when shone through a dust: the scattering effect of ionisation.   


I could go on about how I loved the snippets of languages we hear in the movie, the power of every single actors performance, the little details sprinkled throughout and the fucking soundtrack that I'm currently listening to on Spotify but I'd be here all day writing this.   


I saw Arrival with a friend a few years ago and loved it. I then saw Blade Runner 2049 and was blown away by what Denis Villeneuve did with that franchise and the power of his art direction/ team. And when I heard he was doing a Dune movie, I honestly couldn't think who could be a better choice. I'm glad to say I was right to have confidence in him as this movie is a cinema masterpiece that should be poured over by media students ad infinitum.

hhqqf63,"Just watched it last night. I've never read the books and I only saw one trailer so I went in a bit blind.

Overall, I thought it was a 6. The cinematography was quite good, the set design, the set locations, etc. 

But the story seemed too rushed and it had some pretty big pacing issues. The massive battle between Atreides and the Harrokens wasn't very well developed. A couple scenes initially and then bam, war and then everyone dies. 

The scenes with Paul and Zendaya were a bit weird imo, no real context for why he was dreaming her and then he just kinda stumbles upon her. And that fight at the end was SO anticlimactic. And the movie just kinda ended. 

Even at 2 and a half hours, I feel like there should have been ALOT more backstory and ALOT more character development. I know that's all in the books but I hadn't read them. 

This movie should be able to explain the lore from the books to both nook readers and non, but I just feel like it didn't do enough.

Dune is one of the only big scifi/fantasy titles that I've not read so I was quite excited to see it as a film first for once, but while I felt there was some amazing scope, sets and atmosphere I'm not really sure I connected at all with the storyline and characters. Things felt pretty sterile at times on account of needing to try and keep it moving forward fast enough and it rarely had enough time to pause and add a bit more weight to proceedings. The extremely soft climax definitely didn't help either as it felt more like wrapping a prologue than a satisfying film.

I'll certainly go watch the second part and hopefully it proves to be a good payoff, but maybe something like this would be more suited to the era of big budget streaming TV where you can deliver more of the world and character depth and the pacing can be more easily balanced.",qd6vqv

One of the 1st scenes with paul at the table with his mother and he uses the voice to say ""Give me the water."" The visual of him talking with no words then the voice saying ""Give me the water"" was LOUD and POWERFUL in imax.

hi48jui,"Saw it last night on IMAX.  It took all my willpower to wait and not stream on HBO Max.  

It was an incredible experience that exceeded my expectations.  The visuals and sound were utterly spectacular.  Denis and the team's vision here was just astounding.  It felt familiar enough to be approachable, but utterly foreign at the same time.  The scale and scope was just pure majesty.  

I loved the way the film just drops you into this world, and Denis' emphasis on show, not tell.  To me it really elevated this movie above your typical sci fi/fantasy film or TV show.  It was just deeply immersive.  The story beats and world building felt organic and natural to the characters, not just there for the audience.

I think some of the context I've since read in these threads from book readers has been helpful in understanding things that weren't 100% clear in the film (especially the absence of computers despite the high level of technology), but I appreciated that level of mystery and the extent to which the movie rewards attention and rewatches, as well as room for further exploration in sequels.  I suspect that now Paul is with the Fremen's, they'll be more background into the history in part 2.

I knew going into it that the movie would be anti-climactic, but I was surprised just how much that was the case.  This is definitely an 'act 1' through and through.  The overall plot advances very little, but there is so much going on under the surface.  I just love the time and care with which this story is being told.  It felt very old school, and very unlike most modern movies of this nature.  More like a David Lean epic than a modern blockbuster.

hhtp2fw,"*Originally made this comment elsewhere, but decided to copy and paste it here as a top level comment*


This movie felt hollow. It felt soulless. It felt so empty and so lacking. It completely ditched some of the most important themes and lacked in many of the VERY important character interactions. The movie was simultaneously too slow and too fast. Too slow in the long, drawn out panning shots that do little to actually add to the world (this type of cinematography worked wonders for BR2049). Too fast in how quickly they gloss over important details. 

They REALLY needed to explain more of the Bene Gesserit breeding program and how all of these people saying 'the one' believe in a planted fairly tale. Even Paul and Jessica say 'The One' without really explaining that it's a false prophecy that's more akin to a science experiment to breed specific lineages together to produce someone with specific abilities. ""The Bene Gesserit have been at work here"" is all we get?  This is like, the most prominent theme in the book, that Paul is a false prophet who takes advantage of and manipulates the Fremen to become their leader, take revenge, and then insert himself into the throne.

This movie was so fucking bland in the delivery. Duncan and Leto are the only characters who I feel were acted/delivered appropriate to their book character. 

The accent inconsistency really annoyed me. Zendaya didn't even try to have any kind of accent. I can handle Javier having a really thick accent, but Zendaya having absolutely 0 was just bad directing choice, imo. 

Liet Kynes not having an accent makes a little sense, because Liets father was an immigrant, someone who came based on ecology and fell in love with the world. Absolutely none of this was even mentioned. I have no issue with Liet being portrayed as a woman, this has no bearing on the plot, but I feel like ecology absolutely does have a bearing on the plot and it was just absent, which was borderline insulting. 

It also completely just disregards very prominent and important characteristics of the Freman culture: their very strict lifestyle of wastelessness and of respecting the needs of the tribe as a whole. The fight with Jamis was done out in the open, where they were just freely breathing and exhaling all their moisture(where as in the book, the Sietch was at least set up in such a way to allow people to relax their water safety behavior), in stillsuits (so if one of them dies, the fucking suit is damage at best, and ruined at worst), and they show no mention of Paul crying (""he gives water to the dead"", but also he just fucking gutted a dude and walks away alright?)

Also, zero mention of what a mentat is, and Thufir and Piter have obscenely little screen time. Paul is a mentat and that's sort of important, isn't it? His ability to calculate and reason is plot important. 

No build up to the sabotage from Yueh and the later suspicion that Jessica did it?

And Paul's prescience wasn't elaborated on. The scene where Jessica and Paul are in the desert in the tent and he gets his first big hit of the spice was sort of meh. Lacked the emotional impact of the impeding Jihad, his potential death, and his assurance to Jessica that he would be known and loved by the Fremen. This was a key turning point for Paul in the books, where he really becomes Duke and becomes a man and starts being sure of himself. In the book, it also does a good job of telling us that with the spice, Paul can see the fucking future. In the movie, it's just like 'I just see a girl again and I might get stabbed, but also I was handed a knife, and there's a plauge across the universe and you're the reason I'm a freak'. Just weak writing of these scene when really, I thought it would be pretty straightforward. Prescience is VERY IMPORTANT in the book, and then just glosses over in this film.",qd6vqv
hhlih2q,"Didn't care for it that much, don't have any desire to rewatch, thought that too much time was wasted on long shots of people walking or in some poses and moving somewhere or on panning shots of nature/buildings/etc. I didn't think that this movie is one where characters should talk/interact so little, some of the roles that are bigger in the books and previous movie and tv series were wasted on actors, they could have been played by random extras and nothing would change.

Overall felt like a waste. It didn't add anything to the story, didn't convey it in a way that made it interesting or engaging on it's own which made me think about the source material and how things could have been made better. Appreciate talent of a director who made the film, but Villeneuve's slowness didn't work for me this time, and that hypnotic quality people like so much barely helped me to go through the film.  
  
As the result I don't know if people will care for main heroes or political intrigue in the movie - almost everything is so muted, minimalist and distanced.  
  
>!As compared to the books, Jessica cried for more then a half the time she was on screen, while Paul was too stoic - he didn't have much emotion besides immediate reaction to circumstances, and even in that regard he was very restrained. So much for dreaded feminist replacement of Kines, when two main characters fall squarely into traditional gender archetypes and it goes against the grain of the story.

Didn't care for Paul's visions - they were too focused and there was no drowning of him in countless possibilities and uncertainty. Aforementioned stoicism further downplays them, which is why his outburst at his mother didn't feel earned. This has a bigger effects because there are further actions that happen in the second movie, lack of proper visions means lack of proper set up.!<  
  
Didn't like costumes except for a few, that minimalism made everything look like it's a low budget movie - spray painted sports gear, military uniforms from studio archives and 3D printed armor from Halo, Destiny and other futuristic shooters. Wanted some effort and originality, there was almost none.",qd6vqv
hhlqx3e,"Visually stunning, very well acted, but as someone who hasn't read the books it was mostly inscrutable abstract nonsense. Having zero emotional investment in the characters and world made it very difficult to care about the events of the film in any deep way, resulting in a boring bland watch. It felt like watching a mild season of a long running TV show cold, compressed into \~two and a half hours.

I'll say this though, I respect that they didn't do much if any hand holding explaining things ad nauseum to the audience and made it specifically for readers of the books. I imagine that if I had read the books prior to seeing this film and I would absolutely have loved it (if it's a faithful adaptions, I don't know).

Also, the sound mixing was straight up bad to me. I couldn't clearly understand what they were saying like half the time and the dialogue being filled with world specific terminology completely unknown to me just exacerbated the issue.

I doubt this becomes the next LOTR or Star Wars, which are both self-explanatory, this film felt like it required homework before watching to get much out of it other than cool visuals.",qd6vqv
hhlse5d,"This was really well made and pretty, but I have to say as a dune fan it was kind of hrs to watch.   All the messages about love and sacrifice is missing.   Major characters just aren’t present, and it feels like some important universe building was left out.   Maybe that 5 minute Virginia madsen narration intro wasn’t such a bad idea",qd6vqv

hhskpqm,"Pretty blown away by the film. Easily my best movie theater experience ever. There is no other way to see this than on IMAX. 

Pretty surprised by the comments on here. Thought Villenueve did a wonderful job intertwining story and plot. Felt like this movie could've easily been the biggest exposition dump ever recorded, or just 2 straight hours of plot before you get to the story but that was not the case. 

The blend of sci-fi, politicking, world building, and action sequences especially, was phenomenal.",qd6vqv
hhtqe8d,"Visually one of the best I’ve ever seen. But the movie itself, was bleh. I never felt connected to any of the characters other than Jessica. So many people died but I felt no emotion towards them. I have only listened to part of the audiobook and it seemed to stick to the book fairly well. But as excited as I was to see this, it was a letdown.",qd6vqv
hhxewxw,"For those who think there wasn't much depth to the character of Paul:

\*\*Obligatory 'this is just my opinion' warning... not saying you're wrong... just sharing my own thoughts\*\*

I keep seeing this criticism pop up. I'll admit, I was surprised to discover that this was people's reaction. I personally felt like there was plenty of depth to this character. No, the movie doesn't have Paul verbalize his inner conflict, like some scripts do, but I still think there's plenty of juice to extract from Chalamet's performance.

Think about the scenes in which Paul connects with his friend Duncan. In almost every other scene, we see Chalamet portraying Paul in a very controlled, almost muted way. However, when he meets up with Duncan, he drops that persona entirely. He's free, he's comfortable, he's himself. I thought it was a wonderful way of showing that Paul isn't 'boring', per se... he's a character who's more muted persona is forcibly shaped by having the weight of multiple worlds on his shoulders. His station in life, his responsibility, his duty...  they leave little room for wasted words or frivolous behavior. Even if it isn't directly commented on, the personal conflict he's dealing with seems as clear as day: he's finally taking on the mantle of leadership that's been hanging over his head since the day he was born. Combine that with, what one can only imagine, are the pressures associated with being told, from an early age, that you might literally be a messiah... I find it fascinating watching him navigate these impossibly demanding circumstances. 

Maybe people would rather be privy to his more vulnerable thoughts and emotions, but I actually enjoyed searching for more subtle tells in Chalamet's performance. And there's something to be said about a hero who must focus exclusively on what can be done... because they must... because untold numbers are counting on them. Keep in mind, maybe I'm projecting meaning where there is none; but I felt like there was more than enough character development to go along with the spellbinding world building that unfolded.",qd6vqv
hhxoa5e,Denis is unparalleled at creating and establishing universes. He cannot be topped on world-building and it’s not even close.,qd6vqv
hib6dkl,"I loved this movie, so much. Gonna watch it again and again.

While watching this I got reminded often about what Villeneuve said about what he learned from BR2049. I know that flick was an internet darling but when I watched it, I could absolutely see how it tanked at the box office.

I think he learned a lot about dealing with large audiences. And that was tough to do because the task in part one was world building and that can be a very boring endeavor. But he included enough action, mystery, slight comedy etc to keep an audience intrigued. And it paid literally paid off (40m, part 2 baby).

I saw a lot of people say this movie was boring, which is how I reacted to 2049, but I do hope the majority end up liking this. It was really well done.

Felt so refreshing. Reminded me a lot of when I went to see Mad Max at the cinema. So much awe and wonder, so many new things that captured my imagination. It totally transported me into its world. Made me forget that this was just a movie.",qd6vqv
higye74,I felt no connection to any of the characters. They felt bland and uninspired.,qd6vqv
hhklooj,"Once again, Denis Villeneuve delivers!  


  
I've only read 1/3 of the first book, and I knew some things about Dune in general from past media and games, but this is pretty much my first full exposure to the story.  


  
I'll start with very minor nitpicks. A lot of the sets, although absolutely gorgeous, aren't very ""alive"", I'm always peeved when Sci-Fi/Fantasy sets that are supposed to be ""where people live"" are vast empty brutal rooms with very little signs of actual every day living. Also, I don't know if in the books we see a sandworm so early but it felt very much like the encounter in the last act is very much to ""see the sandworm"" in the first part of the movie... Don't get me wrong, it was awesome, but still it felt wedged in there in the pacing. Finally, although I enjoyed the pacing of the film, I can tell they opted to satisfy the book readers more than the newcomers, which I can respect but as a non reader I had to remind myself of that fact throughout my viewing.  


  
Regardless of these really minor negatives, it's an amazing film. We are very lucky to live in an age where this type of visual story telling is possible, and I think this franchise has the potential to be a new juggernaut like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Villeneuve blends all the sci-fi/fantasy classics together and brings it to another level, giving us what some consider impossible, an art house blockbuster film.   


  
Its engrossing world building, textured soundtrack, crisp cinematography, elite cast and top-notch performances all come together for a one of a kind blend of grandiose story telling.

My complaint about the movie is the same complaint I have of the book: the story is humorless and uninteresting. I'm sure a lot of people will love it the way a lot of people love the book.

The good:
- The score and visuals were out of this world. They did everything they needed to do to make this succeed from that perspective. 
- The cast was generally great. 

The bad:
- Timothée Chalamet has to be one of the most bland actors I’ve ever seen. He brings nothing but a pretty face, and that face barely moves an inch the entire movie. He basically has two looks: serious, and serious with a bit of a concerned look. 
- A lot of great epics have something this was sorely lacking: comic relief. Star Wars has Han and Chewie, C-3PO, etc. LOTR has the hobbits, Gandalf, Gimli, etc. I don’t want a marvel movie, but this didn’t make me laugh or smile once. Comic relief is there so that the tense parts are more felt. This really just didn’t give the viewer any change in emotion through the whole film. 
- the pacing just felt… off. It didn’t seem like the movie really ramped up and down very well between scenes. It almost seemed like watching a stream of consciousness. Usually I can kind of tell where a movie is intrinsically, but I had to keep looking down at my watch to figure out what act we were supposed to be in.",qd6vqv

hiia9l2,"Seems much of the praise for this film comes from those familiar with the books. I can understand how that would be the case if you came into the film with context, but as someone unfamiliar with the source material, I found it incoherent and lacking exposition.

This was made worse by the characters mumbling their way through the dialogue, compounded by the fact that the places and people were named in such a complex way (except the main character, who was named “Paul”). 

During the action scenes, I found it difficult to distinguish each side. In one scene I even thought to myself “oh good, backup has arrived” only for them to be slaughtered by said backup. 

Many have also praised the world building, but it felt vast yet empty to me. Flying over the city(?) it looked totally devoid of life. It felt like I was watching a planet populated by only a few dozen inhabitants – aside from a brief scene where the inhabitants were chanting something that again I couldn’t understand. 

I’m a big fan of Denis, but this film was largely fan service and did very little to welcome those new to the story.",qd6vqv

It did nothing to make me care about the characters in the beginning, so the stakes weren't all that high for me later on.

Frankly, it's pretty clear that this needed to be a show and not a movie if they wanted to fit in all the lore without sacrificing the characters.",qd6vqv

There is SO much source material and so many characters that I really think this would have been much better as a tv series. Personally I would rather the filmmaker had stripped everything down to its core elements for the sake of a more emotionally impactful movie. The original Star Wars, lord of the rings, game of thrones, all revolve around good characters. Not really feeling that at all in this new dune film.",qd6vqv

hhtax7c,"I liked it but I'm disappointed overall.

They didn't go into the terror that is mentats, just some eye rolling.  Hawat is one of the most, if not the most feared mentat in the universe and it wasn't displayed at all.  

I was never scared of Baron Harkonen.  I got that he was a ""bad guy"" because Paul and Leto were obviously good guys.  But there was no insidiousness, no evil, no lack of humanity.  The baron broke a doctor of the Suk school through terror/manipulation, which is unheard of, because the Suk doctors are conditioned to be loyal to their house.  The baron broke Piter, a mentat and turned him from a human computer into a deviant abomination.  His servants didn't look terrified to be with in the same room with him.  Too bad.

I didn't like when Paul told Jessica that she was pregnant and she said she didn't know until after a few days.  No way, man.  Bene Gesserit know the moment it happens because they choose the sperm that fertilizes them.  They control every aspect of their body, from having diseases to deploying them against other bodies.  And at one point during the movie, for Jessica, I thought ""this bitch sure does cry a lot"".  

Duncan and Gurney were way better than I thought they would be.  Liet Kynes was great.  Paul was good.  Leto and Jessica were good.  Stilgar was great, perfect. 

The yelling every time Paul had a dream was annoying, but maybe that's because I saw it in IMAX.

The shot of Leto sprawled naked in the chair, with the baron, blurred in the background was one of the best shots in the film, I thought.

Really wish they had done more with Piter.  Piter was always scary too.",qd6vqv

If the film, at least, made its protagonist's journey interesting, I would understand sacrificing supporting characters, but this films didn't even do that right.

Infinity War comes to mind... It was a two parter. It was part 1 of 2, but also stood on it's own very well.

Other movie series will have movies that set up the finale, move the plot forward, but still stands on their own (Two Towers, Empire Strikes back, etc)

When I go to see a movie, I want that movie to have at least a semblance of a complete story; I don't want to have to go back in three years to rewatch Tim staring into the desert for 3 hours just so I can remember what the hell happened this time around. 

I feel like having seen the 1984 version hurt my viewing immensely: not that it was better, but in the way that it approached telling the beginning of a story. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the 1984 version was also supposed to be the first movie in a series right, but it didn't perform well so it was scrapped? That being said, the climate for cliffhangers was different so they still had to shove much much more into the movie so that it had a complete story. On some levels, this made the story far messier but on other measures it at least made it stand alone as a movie on its own. I don't know how to judge this Dune movie on its own; it feels like somebody took the first hour of the movie and tripled it without furthering the plot. 

I would have preferred if they had just released all 2(?) or 3(?) parts at once and made it into a 9 hour miniseries, but instead it is all going to evaporate from my mind to the point of being essentially forgotten by the time another installment comes out. And I know the story behind Dune, which is more than can be said about half the people who haphazardly click on it on HBO go. Too much drinking of the Koolaid in here and not enough critically dissecting the movie in a vacuum outside of its eventual film series and more importantly outside of the fandom.

We are all starved for wonder and amazement. We’ve been couped up and facing death for nearly two years. This movie could be a cinematic powder keg. 

Its basically the book and its one of the weirdest most dense blockbusters I have ever seen. It managed to pack in all the complexity, emotion, religion and politics in a post colonial way.

But... for someone who says he's inspired by Metal Hurlant and Druillet, Villeneuve sure made a very spartiate movie. I mean, it's OK Denis: It's 10000 years in the future! Designs and costumes can look batshit crazy you know, not like some default uniform/brutalist building from the 20th century. In fact it's not ""realistic"" that Josh Brolin is still wearing some t-shirt to train. I'm sure humanity will find a way to upgrade the t-shirt in 10000 years.

I understand Villeneuve went for ""realism"" and restraint, but does everything has to be so normal? It feels forced.

I mean it's a story about a drug that makes you travel through space. GET IT? It should look like some drug trip or something.

This is Game of Thrones for adults dialed up to a 11. Don't think there will be an Arya riding on a white horse-killing the main baddie moment here later on. Maybe Paul will actually be allowed to be the main hero of his story.

Now for the bad stuff. Holy shit this is something of a pattern for Denis' movie now. Just like BR2049, Dune is overly long. There are brilliant moments throughout his movies, yes, but the fillers in between are just too damn slow. 

This should have been way tighter in the editing room and filled with more action and lore if he wanted to keep this cliffhanger ending.

Hope he'll get to make a Part 2 this time. Not sure he will be allowed to make movies at this scale again after BR2049 and now this.",qd6vqv
hhycydb,"I can't believe they pulled it off. I had the *highest* of expectations with this movie, with Denis, Hans, the cast, etc., and yet....the movie surpassed. Well done. Well fucking done. 10/10.",qd6vqv
hi1qnn2,"I haven't read the books (although my wife read the first one) and I've not seen the 1984 version of the movie. I know only a few pop culture references. I also watched at home via HBOMax with decent (not top quality) sound on a large screen.

It was a pretty film. The shots were fantastic and the colors were good, mostly. The final sand worm scene was entirely too dark to be appreciated well, IMO.

The acting was good, although there were some parts I questioned and then decided it was the story's fault, not the actors.

The sound quality was off to me. I have no trouble understanding accents and have understood the dialogue from every other film I've seen with this group of actors. That said, there were several times during this film that I couldn't understand half of what was said, accent or not. I can attribute some of it to there being a bunch of terms and names I'm not familiar with (and still don't know) but too much of it seemed to be mumbled or muffled.

The story wasn't great, and there were many elements I assume are from the book that they should have altered or omitted. For example, when they first landed on Atraxxis (?) Josh Brolin's character said two lines--at separate times--that were just oddly out of place and, if said in real life, would make you look at the speaker strangely. There were times that Jessica just went from concerned to sobbing for seemingly little reason.

There were too many things that had zero/almost zero explanation but were important to the story.

Overall I thought it was okay. I think that if I had read the books then I'd be much more invested and wouldn't constantly be wondering what was what, and would probably rate it a point or two higher than I do now (7/10). As it is, I feel like the director spent far too much on being ""artsy"" with the movie rather than making it really cohesive and substantial.",qd6vqv
hi3fd5s,"As someone who knew literally nothing about dune except that it was like the godfather of space sci Fi epics, HOOOLY FUCKING SHIT. The story definitely felt unfinished but  Villanueve was the right choice. This was the first movie I have seen in 3d which felt right being watched in 3D. I felt absolutely immersed into a very realistic world, the scale of things literally knocked me back, the fucking realism and grit portrayed was phenomenal. It was a visual spectacle for 2.5hrs and was one of the few movies that HAD to be watched on a big screen. It was very exposition heavy without feeling really sluggish which I think is hard to pull off. I do wish the ending would have been on a crescendo rather than where it did end to keep more of the casual viewers piqued but from what I've been reading from people who've read the books it's the right place to stop. Overall, best movie I've seen in past few years purely from a pulling me into a very believable world perspective.",qd6vqv
hi7wvel,This movie definitely gets better with repeat viewings.,qd6vqv
hi8ak4u,"I watched this in Imax last night and I liked it. I didnt love it though. I think it has some problems that would be picked up on and torn into if it was a studio franchise mcu thing, but because its Dune people seem to be more lenient towards it.  


It was my first experience of the world of Dune so I enjoyed the world that was presented and wanted more of it, so assumed Id like the book. Im gonna pick up a copy soon and see.  


I'll see Part 2 but Im confused about the talk of it being a masterpiece.",qd6vqv
hijdxmg,"This was the best movie I have seen in a LONG time. Scifi and fantasy are my favorite genres, and I was hoping this movie would be good based on the casting and being adapted from a book. But it was SO MUCH better than good!   I haven’t read the books, so I went in not know what to expect and was blown away. 

1. Obviously the “universe “ and storyline created instantly capture your interest. With all the “houses” and politics and backstory that gets revealed, it was like Game of Thrones in futuristic space.  There were quite a few times where I was like um, “copying Starwars much?”, but afterwards I realized how much Starwars had copied Dune! 

2. The pacing of this movie was perfect. There were moments of suspense without feeling slow.  Quite a lot happening but it didn’t feel rushed.  I got so sucked into that world that it was incredibly difficult to walk out of the theater and get back to real life.  Maybe I am totally spoiled after Covid and being able to just binge shows, but the worst part of this movie was definitely the feeling of it just getting started then knowing I would have to wait a year to watch more!  I do wish this has been made into a tv show instead of a movie for that reason, but hopefully they can keep making the rest of the series as good as they made this movie!

3. You know how a lot of ads will call movies “visually stunning “?  Well this one actually was. Loved the contrast of worlds, the set design,  the clothing design, the ships!  So many things felt original, which is RARE these days, like the dragonfly ship design!    The sounds and CGI were top notch.  I didn’t find anything that was cheesy or made me roll my eyes.   The actors were perfect, though it’s never enough Momoa… 

4. I loved how complex the story seems. There is clearly a lot of history between these houses, then there is what the Emperor is trying to do now, then there is whatever is actually secretly going on with the Bene Gesserit, and then we also want to know what is going on with Paul and Chani and do they have some sort of “destiny “ to fulfill...    

Probably gonna have to read the books, but PLEASE please please…. Please Hollywood don’t F this up like you did for Game of Thrones or Eragon…   And please don’t change Directors!",qd6vqv
him3pqt,I was dissapointed. It was both way too rushed while also boring. Dream sequences sucked. Just lacked any sort of connection to characters. Would've been much better as a TV show.,qd6vqv
his1klz,"Is there anyone in this thread that has NOT read the book?

To me, who knew nothing about Dune prior to watching this, the movie felt like a collection of very cool scenes and glimpses on an amazing universe from a much bigger story that I was mostly missing out on.

I personally think this is poor storytelling. A movie adaptation should stand on its own. It's ok to have tons of references that only fans of the book will get, as long as the movie feels complete. I don't think this one does at all.",qd6vqv
hhlcjjh,"I was disappointed as soon as the words ""part one"" appeared on screen. So discouraging. Immediately regretted even starting to watch.

hhkokb4,"Did Stilgar know who Paul was as evident in their first meeting where he spits?

And stellan skarsgaard was awesome as Baron harkonnen.  He owned the scene where he said that the traitor could go to be with his wife",qd6vqv
hhkp67b,"I read the book years ago, thought it was decent but wasn’t enough to make me read sequels. I wasn’t very excited for this movie at all. Holy shit did this prove me wrong. I just got back from seeing it for the second time in 24 hours. Completely blew me away. Now I’m dying to re-read the book and watch it a third time",qd6vqv
hhkyz7h,"The only thing I hated was ornithopters. Its like the direction was ""Dragonflies but helicopters"". The whole ""They flap their wings really fast to fly"" gimmick is just...ugh.   


It carries through to my other dislike, in that the production design seems like its the product of 2 minds which are despondent. You have the really otherworldly stuff like the...warp gates and the Atredies ships. But then the Atredies ships have this magic like gliding landings with HUGE MECHANICAL LEGS AND SUPPORTS and stuff. The flappy wings also kinda flies in the face of the whole ""This is the far far far far far future and everything is magic"" thing.   


Outside of that, it's OK. It didn't blow me away. I'd have been more forgiving if I had known just how much of a ""part 1"" this was. I honestly went into it thinking it would encapsulate the whole 84 movie and that a part 2 would be a continuation past that. Instead we only got half the Lynch movie. That kinda annoyed me that it just...ends.",qd6vqv
hhl1wqw,"The good: overall just technically impressive and I was in awe beginning to end. Villeneuve’s direction really bought Dune’s universe to full fruition. So much detail and thought put into every little thing. Some of the things were a lot better than I envisioned in my head when reading the books. Thought it would be hard to not make the works look cartoony but holy shit did they looks freakishly realistic and terrifying. 

Everybody’s casting is spot on, specially Isaac’s Duke and Stellan’s Baron. But in general everybody seemed very into their character and acted their asses off. 

The bad: I left praying there’s a director’s cut. A lot of characters really we needed more screen time or more time telling their stories. The worst thing about the film was Yuen in particularly who’s tragic reason for being a traitor is quickly told in a matter of seconds. While Stellan’s acting and the overall image of the character was grotesque and disturbing, you barely see the Baron doing or saying the evil and disturbing he does in the books, same goes for Vieres.  Where was all the shit talking between him and the Baron??

There’s key scenes from the books that are missing, like that dinner with all the politicians, houses, and such, or the meeting that goes on after Paul’s failed assassination. These two scenes I feel really help establish and explain the political landscape of the planet.

Which kind of brings me to next next point, how do people who haven’t read the books feel about that the movie? I feel like without it I would’ve been completely lost since there’s so much going, and now enough character development or exposition to explain it. 

Overall 8/10. But mainly I feel I’m benefited that I read from the book which why I can give it a high score.I need to watch it again to make sure though. I think if there’s a sequel and it turns out to be good, in can be a 9.",qd6vqv

hhla92k,"Villeneuve is such a methodical purposeful director, genuinely the perfect choice. Every scene flowed into the other perfectly, especially during the first act. Some might say it's slow. But when you're picking what to adapt from the first third of the book (of which there's a lot to choose from) I think the choice to take time and be careful with each scene is crucial and done so well here. I was surprised there's only like 5 songs listed in the credits. The score and the film as a whole just sucks you in for the whole ride, especially in imax. It feels like a real scifi epic, which is the kind of adaption Dune has always deserved.",qd6vqv
hhlj64a,"I freakin loved it. The ending was a bit dry after a phenomenal first 2 hrs. It wasn't bad. It was interesting, but it's just weird how it basically peaked 30 minutes before the end only to setup the next film.

I think it'll be absolutely great to watch back to back once Part 2 drops (hopefully being greenlit), but damn, this was a top tier film. I REALLY enjoyed it. Aesthetics were phenomenal. Great acting performances.

About the only thing I found a little underwhelming was the mother who maybe wasn't as commanding as a presence as I found in the books. She seemed almost shy and sheepish, rather than some intensity behind her reservation to use her ""voice.""

Great world-building though. The sheer scale of the worms made me so happy. The way they introduced and built the ""spice"" was great too.",qd6vqv
hhlrd5h,77 metacritic seems low since everyone was hyping this up to be a cinematic masterpiece on the level of Blade Runner,qd6vqv
hhlt9bj,"I read the book a month ago in anticipation of this movie. Overall it was very good. Not sure how much other would like it who aren't familiar with the books, but it had excellent sound, visuals and tension. The scene with the hunter killer and in the thumper with Paul and Jessica were incredibly tense.

However, the movie does a poor job of explaining the importance of water on Arrakis. I don't think book readers will care very much, because we understand it, but other than a throwaway line from one of the Fremen about wasting water, I don't remember it being pointed out once. I don't think it's obvious that water is the most precious commodity if you're unfamiliar with the books and how much of a role it plays in the story.

The way the use of voice was done was definitely a highlight.",qd6vqv
hhm68yt,Everyone is throwing shade at Warner bros for not “green lighting” part 2 already. Honestly denis villeneuve bit off more than he can chew. I love his ambition but everyone freaking out that Warner bros didn’t green light a sequel to a movie that isn’t popular yet.. Forreal?,qd6vqv
hhm8hqv,"Pacing was just not good. First half of the movie was too rushed while the last half was too slow. It felt like they crammed one season of tv series into two and a half hour. TBH I feel the same problem with every film Denis Villeneuve directed. Still this is the most approachable film he has ever directed, but it could have been better with editing I guess. Only if you were a fan of his films or space opera, give it a try.",qd6vqv
hhmlvjl,"Cinematic masterpiece, cast was great, world and costumes looked amazing. My complaint comes with the storyline and how much was missing from the book. And every social interaction was brief and felt like a lot was missing by way of character development. Dr Kynes who? Gourney Halleck who? Major characters were given 3 lines apiece. The reverend mother said like 7 words. No dinner party scene. This book has enough content to make 3 films and I believe they are trying to squeeze it into 2. Everything felt rushed.",qd6vqv

hhpglgd,"I am a big fan of the book, and was excited to see this. Knowing how dense and meaty the source material is, I understand why a lot of people considered it unfilmable. After seeing the film I don't think anyone else could have pulled off what Villeneuve was able to do. I saw this movie with someone who had not read the book, and they were able to follow the plotline with little to no issue. 

I understand things needed to be trimmed, and I hope an extended cut exists that will release later. 

My only complaint is the scene where we finally get to see Shai-Hulud in all his glory I felt it was too dark, in the trailer you could see the details clearly but in the movie theatre it was extremley muddy. Keep in mind there are no Imax theatres where I live so I saw it on a regular  screen. I don't know if streamers or those who saw it in Imax got a better picture than I did.",qd6vqv
hhpiznh,"Just got back from my screening of Dune. Absolutely loved every minute. The sets, acting and world building felt great.  

The SCORE. Holy shit the score for this movie sent shivers up my spine at multiple points. So good. The sound design overall was awesome and The Voice sounded terrifying.  

My only very, very minor issue was I wish we would have had more Baron Harkonen on screen- but I understand that he will likely be featured more heavily in the next film (if we get one)",qd6vqv
hhpnfub,"I have a love for Lynch’s Dune. It’s hacked to shit and confusing at times, but it was still a fun movie. For the longest time I thought it was the only version I would ever get and I guess I should be happy with it. 

Denis Villenuve just called me a fucking idiot and gave me everything I ever wanted. Holy god this thing is fucking great. Yeah they shuffled a few things and cut plot lines, but everything else is spot on and delivered in one of the most visually stunning sci-fi movies ever. And it’s only the first half of the story. My hype is immeasurable for part 2. Shame they haven’t even started filming yet so it’s going to be a long wait.

hhx4wvb,"Villeneuve seems to have collected everything he's learned from Arrival and Blade Runner, and put it in this one. i could also definitely feel a Ridley Scott influence, if you've ever championed a Ridley Scott Dune, you'll love this.

i'd say the focus of this one is all about world-building (perhaps even more so over plot). every establishing shot felt like a religious experience (omg the sound!). as someone who hasn't read the book and walked in cold, it initially felt as possibly too heavy-handed of a metaphor, right from the first description of Iraq... i mean, Arrakis. but then every few scenes you get this face bending establishing shot that makes you go ""woah, this is some crazy sci-fi shit"".

however i do think the story could have benefited from extra runtime as a high-budget series rather than a film. but then i definitely know it wouldn't have hit the same way at home (at least with my crappy set up). it's ironic that many people will end up watching this on streaming though, in which case maybe it should have been a streaming series all along. i think this movie will be a great example when debating the importance of story versus spectacle for future movies and shows.",qd6vqv

But once they reach their transports, the handmaidens are back and are holding the loose ends.

I was legitimately blown away by this film.

I liked the David Lynch original, but this just shows how good Denis Villeneuve is, he's catching up to Christopher Nolan as one of my all-time favourite filmmakers. 

The thing that blew me away here is that there are no wasted shots, none at all. Every shot is precise and it means something, it's a masterclass ins tory-telling and I think the passion of the director shows through far more than anything else. 

Also, the random Benjamin Clementine cameo was greatly appreciated.

hi3brq8,"Many have complained of the dim lighting in many of the key scenes but I found the use of shadows and dark that much more mysterious and thrilling. The old adage of cinematography - use the shade to amp up the realism and tension...puts the viewer off balance.  Also enhances the ethereal dreamlike quality of the pacing.  If DV does not win best director Oscar for this, send the Academy packing.  TC was spot on : the slight build, very pale, challenging demeanor.  They were all perfectly cast but I wish there were more scenes with the Reverend Mother, Dr. Yueh, and Shadout Mapes.  Oh well, director's cut will have to provide.",qd6vqv
hi5kzzy,"I posted this a few days ago as well but I still don't get how people say the movie feels only like a first act or the ending is too abrupt. 

The movie follows the basic story structure of: exposition -> rising action -> climax -> falling action -> resolution

Exposition: Scenes on Caladan and getting introduced to Arrakis.

Rising action: Spice Harvester scene

Climax: The Harkonnen attack on Arrakeen.

Falling action: Sardaukar attack on the ecological outpost + running from the worm.

Resolution: Paul kills Jamis and takes his place amongst the Fremen. ""My road leads into the desert"". Cool shots of Paul walking with the Fremen towards his destiny and ""desert power"". 

Maybe it's just me but the ending didn't feel too rushed at all. 

My biggest gripe was with the first half of the movie and the lack of set-up of Yueh's betrayal among other things.",qd6vqv

Why is combat almost exclusively limited to blades? Like, Duncan was badass, but in a gun fight he would have been killed within minutes of the movie. These people have dragonfly aircrafts yet they still battle as if it's the middle ages? 

Also, why didn't Paul and his mom use their awesome speaking powers at the end there? Seems like that would have really come in handy when their fortress was breached.

I was surprised the Botanical garden was removed which contained the warning message to Jessica.

hico1pg,"I really enjoyed it. It feels like it ends right when things are getting started but they basically corrected everything that was ""wrong"" with the first movie in that they simply took time to tell the story. 

The dialogue was minimal and not a single word was wasted, the soundtrack and score are phenomenal, and every actor gave their character life and no one was miscast.

If I was 13 and this was the first major sci fi epic I ever saw, I would be absolutely blown away but instead I am spoiled by spectacle already and so I can only appreciate this as a worthy film adaptation of a classic novel.",qd6vqv
hidry6c,"Overall, as an adaptation, it was pretty perfect. Basically scene for scene from the book. The casting was pretty spot on too. That being said, I can absolutely see why people who haven't read the book are saying it's boring or confusing. I was actually pretty shocked with how little they explained a lot of the details of the world and the factions. As a book reader, I appreciated that they didn't bog us down with that stuff, but I could see where it would be overwhelming for someone coming in fresh.

The pacing was really good for such a long movie, and of course the real star of the show is the production design and cinematography. The whole thing was just dripping with atmosphere. I really appreciate that they let a PG-13 fantasy film be genuinely nightmarish at times. Reminded me of the LOTR trilogy.

The biggest thing I thought was missing was the spirituality. The book has so many great nuggets of wisdom about maturity, self-control and leadership, and it felt like the movie just glossed over it all. I hope part 2 gets deeper into those things.

Heres my nitpicks...

1. Arrakis didn't feel oppressively hot. Everyone looked too dry and comfortable.

2. Everyone does the Fremen's eyes wrong. They always just look like regular eyes with a light blue glow. In the book they're described as being deep cobalt blue, almost to the point of being black, with no whites to the eyes. They don't glow!

3. Baron Harkonnen wasn't big and disgusting enough. He just looked like Brando from Apocalypse Now lol.

4. Lady Jessica was way too anxious and emotional. She's a Bene Gesserit and they're whole thing is being in total control of their emotions at all times. The Gom Jibbar scene especially felt wrong for her.

5. The sandworms mouths are described as a rim of glinting crystal teeth. That's why the knives they make from them are called crysknives. In the film, they're long needly whale teeth. I didn't like the look of the crysknives as a result.",qd6vqv
higj7f2,"Spoiler Alert , what hurt me were the plot holes that were not necessary ! Since the book spelled out everything . Like the smoke , that formed , before the hunter seeker! floating glow globes , but no smoke detectors?? Any kind of smoke in Paul's room should have alerted every one in security and military , before the hunter seeker got , five inches , from the wall let alone five feel! 

How could the Duke , not know that his only descendant , wasnt in the thopter , all that time in the most dangerous incident , JUST AFTER , the hunter seeker episode , while Paul (not in the book) got out to call the spice miners into the rescue thopters???

And the dumbest of all , all that damn War-machine armor, they had along with schields , but the guards at the door had neither , allowing an easy attack by the Harkonnens??? (not in the book either )",qd6vqv
hipprte,The first part of this movie should have been an opening crawl,qd6vqv
hiwritz,"Here’s my opinion and everyone is welcome to agree/disagree. I LOVED Blade Runner 2049. It made me feel things. The use of cgi was appropriate. The colors, the visuals, the cinematography. I mean WOW. Now Dune, did absoluelty nothing for me. I’m shocked it’s the same director. It felt detached, unemotional, bland, too clean, cut scenes thrown in/randomly edited so it felt confusing at times to someone who is new to this series. It looked and felt cgi/fake/green screen. Somehow Blade Runner didn’t feel that way to me at all and I’m not sure why these two movies feel like they came from a different person. Anyone else?",qd6vqv
hj3j249,"I had not seen any adaptations before this but I kept seeing everyone say how hard it was to adapt.  This movie proved to me that Dune is indeed extremely hard to adapt to the big screen.  It does lend itself much better to series format.

For the movie itself, it is an astounding technical achievement but I felt like half of the movie was dramatic shots of characters to background vocalization.  The troop action was not particularly exciting either and if I hadn't read the book I think I would have liked it even less.  

Everything was basically underdeveloped and I think the magic of Dune is in the details.  I felt like only Stilgar and Chani were done Justice, and maybe that's just because we were only introduced to them.  Anyhow, this film didn't even come close to the emotional impact of the book but I have a strong feeling Part 2 is going to deliver much better.",qd6vqv
hj4rqep,"Even though I've never read the books, I could tell the doctor was at least up to no good. I get the impression that it comes to readers as a shock to see Dr. Yueh behind the betrayal in the books but I believe any movie watcher who's half competent could see it coming from a mile away based on the Asians are the bad guys stereotype.

Another bit that bothered me was also the observation flight with the spice harvester. Why couldn't the carrier ship land and evac the miners on the harvester after the clamp failed? I know they just moved there but c'mon! It's the far future! There should be enough room and weight to carry the miners, especially if they used the skycrane's balloon attachment. The Duke Leto and co coming to the rescue in their thopters did not look contrived at all.",qd6vqv

Or something like Blade Runner 2049 - while I wouldn’t say it was shit, I don’t think it was a very good film. Despite how good it looked the story was kinda sucked and that’s that.

But Dune was great and looked amazing. Good story that I didn’t know where it was going, great acting, amazing atmosphere. I was a little annoyed at the ending at first, but after discussing it with a mate I understand that there’s too much to cram into one film.",qd6vqv

Also laying bare the entire inner workings of the plot and giving the audience full context of what is about to happen sucks all drama out of the events of the story. There's barely any themes to extract, there's barely any characters to discuss, and all people are praising is either 1. accuracy to the book or 2. the visuals and world design. If the spice must flow, why did they uproot the infrastructure that's been successfully harvesting it for 80 years? So that they could create an absurdly convoluted assassination plot? Okay, cool. Then I guess the spice isn't that important since we can completely shut down production for your little egotistical Shakespeare nonsense. Almost everything that happens in this movie is not the result of decision making, but with Frank Herbert playing with chess pieces.",qd6vqv
hhngopv,"I loved the movie.  It looked great, it sounded great, the acting was great, it looked exactly how I had imagined the would of dune to look.


That said, it failed as a movie Imo.


For people who had a pre existing  knowledge of dune going in from the books, the original movie or just general knowledge, itl be great.   But for people going in blind.... This movie does an awful job of explaining anything. 


I loved it, my buddy loved it, both our GFs like it.... But had A LOT of question afterwards.  ""why did you go to arakas again? Why did they want the spice again? Who were the ladies in the black hats exactly?"" etc etc.  

It was severely lacking any exposition, which was weird for a 2 1/2 hour movie, and felt like it just expected you to know what was going on, which is a complaint I've seen a lot.  Add in to that a lot of the lines being muttered (did anyone actually understand the"" fear is the mind killer"" monolog Either time?) or they just dropped one of a dozen ""made up words"" casually into a conversation.


I loved it.  I knew dune going in. But I can see a lot of people having a lot of questions afterwords or thinking it was a really cool, pretty, vague mess.


It was a long movie thst covered half the first book, and tneeded more time to do it. I've always felt dune would work best as a series, not a movie.  It's jsut to dense to break up into 2-3 hours ever 2-3 years.",qd6vqv
hhpuh2n,"Great movie, amazing visuals and sound.  But guys, what the hell is up with the fight scenes?!? They were terrible! I can't wait for the next movie but I hope they find a new fight choreographer and fight scene editor (if that's a thing).  i'm not sure who else is responsible for the actual way a fight scene is filmed but it definitely needs work. that last fight with jamis was so disappointing.",qd6vqv
hhs7aac,Am I the only one underwhelmed by this remake?,qd6vqv
hhsu2gz,The tone of the movie was just not my style. Two and a half hours of characters whispering with blank expressions. There were probably less than 5 times the entire movie in which someone smiled. Just not my thing.,qd6vqv
hhtzj1x,"93/100. I wish they didn't cut the dinner scene and the fight with Jamis wasn't as good as it could have been, but that is made up for by the absolute grand scale. Denis showing us just what 2021 technology can do for the film medium.

Also: Everyone's saying that non-book readers they watched it with followed it just fine, but then the main criticisms is that the story is lackluster. The book readers love this movie because they didn't need any of that story. It put absolutely incredible visuals to a story that's already in their mind.  
  
I'm a book reader, I absolutely loved it, and I hope that people on the fence read the book. I know it shouldn't be a requirement to watching the movie and if it *really* didn't draw you in, then don't bother.

hnkhlp3,"I felt this movie was a dumpster fire.  I just read Dune for the first time and can say without a doubt this movie missed the mark on so many levels.  The writing and pacing of the movie were the biggest perpetrators to my disliking of it.  Paul being a brooding teen, Jessica looking always scared up until the end, the baron and the Harkononen basically being Sith Lords, Yueh's total lack of screen time considering his part in the first act, the lack of mentioning of waters importance and skewing the waters poured on the date palms.  Oh and the planetologist exposition on the little makers during their death scene but you know maker hooks makes for a better ooooooh moment.  Oh the Sardakar not disguised as Harkononen, so the political aspect of the book is tossed aside... 

All in all, I felt the movie cheapened such a wonderful novel and all this was, was an attempt to remake the worst movie of 1984.",qd6vqv

I liked the movie.  But almost nothing happened? Maybe it's pacing but I felt like the movie went so far over the top in cinematography which was awesome. Few cliches like as soon as they sent atreides in one could tell it was a trap.

I'll probably get down voted and that's fine but no is actually discussing the movie.

Everyone we were introduced to in the movie basically died except Paul, his mom, Baron(almost) and the fremen.

And now what? We wait 3+ years for the next one? Gonna lose so many casual viewers that were giving this a shot.

What I got were great visuals. The lore is cool. That's it. I knew what was going to happen the entire time (either it was very obvious or told to us) and I was waiting and waiting for it to unforld. I was not excited once, I couldn't care less about the characters which are as bland as they come and the mood is completely the same the entire time. I'm not one of those ""worst movie ever people"" but I genuinely am puzzled over why this movie is so hyped. What besides the visuals is there?

I've loved every single movie DV has made, seeing most of them multiple times in the theatre, but I just couldn't figure out what everyone was so excited about here. If there's more to it, it didn't come across in the movie.

Beautiful visuals, sound was amazing, but story and characters were meh. If I had to bet, I can't see him making enough off this movie to even get to make the other parts.

hhoq26j,"It's good, but to me it's not ""the next Star Wars and Lord of the Rings"". World building is on point especially since I never read the book, was only confused sometimes because the audio drowns out the dialogue and they're saying all these made up words, but I definitely got the gist of it. 

Visuals were fine, definitely don't get the hype over how it looks overall though. It's a very brown and drab sci-fi movie, when I look at Dune book covers and see these deep oranges and reds. Some shots could be side by side with Sicario and I couldn't tell the difference.

Just like Blade Runner 2049 the first half is the better half to me and then drags out a bit. It has some pretty major pacing issues that A New Hope and Fellowship of the Ring never had its reliance on there being a Part 2 puts a sour taste in my mouth, because this movie doesn't have a real 3 act story or ending. It just stops, and that kinda sucks.

Has a few 10/10 parts, like the first time they encounter a sandworm, but I can just watch those on YouTube later instead of rewatching the whole thing, because there are some other parts in there that felt like a 6/10.",qd6vqv
hhpoue8,"I liked it and it was an extremely visually impressive movie (should have expected nothing less from the BR 2049 director), but I still think they tried to do too much in one movie.

There wasn't enough time to explain the universe for people who are unfamiliar with the books. For example, why do they fight with swords and not guns and how do the shields work (barely explained, it's literally one line)? What is a hunter seeker? What is the relationship between the Emperor and the two houses featured in the movie? Who are the sardukar? What's with the dude who rolls his eyes back into his head (the mentat)? Who are the Bene Gesseret?

They also didn't really explain much about spice.

Another issue I had with the film was that they didn't really have time to develop the characters. 90% of the cast got a few scenes and then died, and as a result their deaths weren't very impactful. The main character also didn't have many human moments or face any adversity... The only times he breaks his usual stern persona and feels like an actual human are a few of the scenes with Duncan, when he finds out his father dies and when he has to kill the guy in the duel. Otherwise, Paul is just sort of good at everything (I get that he's like, a messiah and the product of a lifetime of hardcore training and generations of eugenics), and it wasn't very interesting to watch a character who doesn't really face any physical or emotional hardship.

Despite it's flaws, I really loved it and I hope the sequel gets greenlit, but I won't get my hopes up :(.",qd6vqv
hhqgugx,"It was visually spectacular - and I really really enjoyed all the spaceships / architecture / furniture etc. The audio was pretty excellent too.

But overall, I felt it was really boring. I actually found myself midway through googling to see how long it was.

I felt like the pacing was really off. Also - a lot of characters that are important in the book had incredibly fleeting roles in the film. Personally, I think characters should be done justice or just cut entirely.

hhsd54x,"I'm disappointed. It was a beautiful movie, and there were definitely parts I liked, but overall I came away from it bored and a little frustrated.

&#x200B;

 Lady Jessica was way too emotional for me, and as one of my favorite characters from the book, she was a let down. There were way too many shots of Paul staring out at the scenery contemplatively, or multiple long establishing shots of the same environments. The visions also seemed to come at really frustrating times way too often, and they lasted way too long. They didn't do nearly enough to establish how harsh the desert was, imo. and I felt there was a lot of world-building left to the books, for example: why they had to use swords as weapons,  or why spice was integral to the empire (there was a vague explanation about space travel, but imo it didn't really convey how truly vital spice is to everything in the empire, or why.) There also seem to be a lot of people in this thread dismissing complaints ""because in the book"", but if it's not conveyed properly in the movie it doesn't matter what the book says. 

&#x200B;

I thought the Baron and Leto were both done wonderfully, and the politics were conveyed fairly well, although I think the betrayal's importance should have been better explained. visually I loved everything about it, from the sets to the costumes. The ships were amazing. Complaints about explaining the why of the combat aside, it was really well done and I was engaged in all of the action scenes.",qd6vqv
hhseji7,"Once again, Dune proves that it can’t be adapted, at least as a movie.  I think a lot of people are letting the plot progression seem better than it is because the visuals and the score are so on point.  By far my least favorite Denis movie of the last decade.  Whole lot of orgasmic visuals but the movie feels like a great movie missing an hour of footage, and that missing hour makes the movie….  Not great, and slightly incoherent.  To say this is the next LoTR is either some serious homer attitude from Dune superfans or just a travesty.",qd6vqv

After about the 60-90 minutes of Dune it was clear that the movie wouldn't actually resolve anything, so I just didn't care about anything that was happening after that. It felt like a roller coaster that goes up, and up, and up, and up for two and a half hours, and then it just ends.

I feel like I should add a disclaimer that I'm generally not a fan of Scifi so maybe that's part of it, but man, this movie just totally missed for me",qd6vqv

As everyone is saying here, story was missing a lot, and conclusion felt unsatisfying. Zendaya probably sprained her neck turning that many times. Paul suffers from Captain Marvel-iosis in that he's OP from the start for no reason (born for greatness yadda yadda), but doesn't go through reasonable conflict apart from going from point A to point B to point C like a videogame character. His mopiness and sombre-ness is a bit much at times. 

Can't tell a difference between Dunkin ""Aquaman"" Donuts and Gurney Thanosman's characters in their purpose, seems like there should be just one ""swordsman teacher/bro"", rather than 2.

I love the idea of a feudal governance in space, a historic sci-fi pretty much. Yet the execution was weak and had all the quirks repeated in hundred other movies.

>!I understand that a lot of the movies that came after the book drew inspiration and straight-up stole from it but I felt 0 originality in this movie. The set design was straight from 2049, the colour palette bland and boring, soldier uniforms uninspiring, music was just loud and forced excitement in moments that didn't deserve it, the dialogue was forgettable.  Also watching it in IMAX 3D was terrible, 70% of the movie had 70% of the screen blurred.!<",qd6vqv

And the cast was awesome, not a weak link in the chain.  I want more big movies like this.

Also, it sucks that we won’t get a sequel til at least 2 or 3 years but I imagine this movies reputation is going to grow.  Kind of how Breaking Bad took a year off and it gave everyone time to catch up with it on Netflix and it came back to huge numbers.  Mark my words part 2 will be hyped like a Marvel movie.

The movie starts, I am in my favorite seat in a 1.43 IMAX theater that I picked out weeks ago, crowd is into it and cheering for trailers. Movie starts and literally it was just... a fog. Couldn't understand what anyone was saying, the characters seemed like they were all half asleep except Momoa, and things were just... happening with no world building or explanation. After 50-ish minutes, I decided to leave.

Went home and rewatched some of it on HBO Max with subtitles, and that helped... maybe 20% understand a bit better, but the movie still felt like a chore. I skimmed through the rest to see if there were any good action scenes and even those felt...somber? Everyone here is ranting and raving about what a marvel it is, especially the visuals, and honestly, I can't even appreciate those. Not even the IMAX shots kept me engaged. 

I'm not saying the movie is bad, I'm just saying it is most definitely NOT FOR ME. I'm usually pretty spot on with what the public likes and I don't forsee this doing more than $100M domestically. Maybe $120M if it's lucky.",qd6vqv

So....that was boring af. I was hooked in the first half. Costume/set design/cinematography is amazing. But that second half felt like putting my hand in a psychic flame box, yet much less exciting. So incredibly boring. It made me appreciate the Lynch version even more....

And even though the movie is two and a half hours long and every scene is left to play out at a deliberate, sometimes self-indulgent pace, there are still things that are missing. The world-building is especially lacking, and it's questionable how much a viewer who hasn't read the book will actually get out of the movie.

After the hype..I just.....couldn't get into it. It just dragged on too much. And TC was miscast. I'm not sure how he is in the book. But in the movie. He just doesn't have that charisma of a hero to support. 

Why are Duncan and Paul so close? I thought they were brothers or an uncle/nephew bond. 

The politics of the entire universe could have been explained better. Or even presented visually somehow. Even after an hour, I'm still trying to remember what house is who and who leads what. 

TC just has so much plot armour. It's laughable. For a akinny little perosn, man survives crashes and figths like nothing. The ""figth"" at the end was laughable. Boy who has never killed, goes up against a battle worn warrior. And he kills him....just like that.",qd6vqv
hiku2dg,"Just saw this film. I went in with high expectations, $160m budget, raving reviews and left absolutely disappointed.

I'll make it clear that I know nothing about Dune, I had never heard of it until this film was announced. I don't have any prior investment into the story or characters. So as a film, this was really quite boring.

The fights were great, the VFX were cool especially with how things explode within their shields, that's a nice effect. But everything else was boring me to death.

The sound design isn't particularly great either. This film is LOUD, but not good loud like Dunkirk where you feel like you're in a war zone. The best loud parts in this film are the voice parts. Other than that it's 2.5 hours of almost constant BUM BUM BUM BANG BANG BANG thumping bass, chanting and angelic singing. Not a high point for Zimmer. Many lines of dialogue are just mumbled and hard to make out. It's hard to focus on anything when you're just being shook to death by Dolby Atmos and wincing at the shear volume. 

I'll see the second part just to see if it's any better. But this film really was ""meh"".",qd6vqv
hipp8wq,This movie could have been a memo,qd6vqv
hjzu9fd,"I was very disappointed.

An incoherent mishmash. Like he randomly took a bit of this page and that page and that one.

Terrible acting, due to a terrible script. Movies are best when they show the plot not when the characters verbalize everything that’s happening.

Terrible casting. Thanos, Aquaman and the dude from Guardians. Why put these very recognizable blockbuster faces in a movie that’s supposed to transport is to another world? The opposite of immersive. And most of them are there for just a blip. 

The designs were terrible. Classic case of  form over function. Spaceships that can cross the universe but starting the ‘helicopter’ is a sequence from a 1980’s movie of a guy going though a bunch of random switches. Not to mention the impracticality… and cod pieces? Really?

No character development whatsoever. Random scenes cut together. No tension. It goes on forever without actually going anywhere. Just guh!

I have some low standards because I love me some scifi but this belongs down at the bottom with the worst ever made.

And the Baron? What the hell was that? Double guh.

The great Duncan is behind the enemy fighters and before he attacks he screams his head off? Haha, could this movie be more dumb.",qd6vqv

I think this is an amazing movie. Executed brilliantly. But I am glad I watched it at home for the first time because I needed to rewind a bunch. And some scenes I watched multiple times simply because I enjoyed the action or the dialogue so much. I think the whole first watch took me 4-hours because I kept pausing and rewinding.

Perhaps then they will realize oh no this the type of story not meant for general movie audiences but streamers will eat it up. Then maybe we can get a tv series of children of dune and that would be perfect since leto2 is much more prominent in the later books. Hey maybe this whole thing will work out. Warners will finally learn heady sci fi books belong on tv and we can get that an enders series that starts with speaker for the dead.

hi5wpo9,"List of a few improvements and misses when compared to the Lynch

* Advantage Lynch for telling the story in one movie
* Advantage Dennis for how the weirding voice is depicted 
* Advantage Lynch bald witches cooler looking than veiled witches 
* Advantage Lynch more Yueh and Yueh's last words. He's the Judas of this movie but gets almost no screen time to build up the magnitude of the betrayal. 
* Advantage Lynch Paul recites the litany of fear while being tested. 
* Advantage Dennis Letos poison tooth scene where Baron ends up on the ceiling
* Advantage Lynch more Yueh and Yueh's last words. He's the Judas of this movie but get almost no screen time to build up the magnitude of the betrayal. 
* Advantage Dennis more Duncan and much cooler Duncan Idaho. 
* Advantage Lynch the scene with the emperor and Guild navigator was epic
* Advantage Lynch more Thufir and Piter plotting. Keeping the doubts about Jessica's loyalty. 
* Advantage Dennis (a big advantage) the Baron is not ridiculous

All in all, I love both movies. Dennis made so many improvements but it's hard to understand how he told half the story yet had to cut out so much that was included in the original. I would expect more not less. But I love both movies. I can't say one is better than the other. We forget Lynch is also a great director.",qd6vqv

I loved Lynch's Dune and had my hopes for this one.  I know most people hate Lynch's Dune but I've always loved it.  anyways.  This movie just met all my hype and surpassed it.  I can't think of one negative thing about it.  It was beautifully made, the acting was perfect, the music was wonderful.    


10/10 will watch again and since I saw this on HBO I am thinking about going to the theater in a couple weeks to catch it that way.  I live an hour and a half from a movie theater so its not an easy trip for me but this is worth it.",qd6vqv

hjif2cu,Such a beautiful movie to look at but was completely underwhelmed by the story  . The end happens and I felt like nothing was accomplished I get there is a sequel but still felt like an incomplete film . Also the main character name being Paul in a pure fantasy world felt like the laziest written ever .,qd6vqv
hjn0myn,"I went into the movie completely blind, not knowing a single thing about Dune except for the fact that they throw terms at you that aren’t explained (except for an appendix in the back as a sort or “translator”?). 

To be honest, this movie doesn’t really stand out to me. A lot of sci-fi movies that have come out for a while all seem to have the same “feel”, if that makes sense. Maybe it’s the way all the music feels the same, or the way the shots also feel the same, but atmospherically it doesn’t feel special. (Though, I suppose there’s only so much variation they can have, especially if they go to real places to film.) 

Normally while I do take note of this, in other movies I feel like I end up not caring because it ends up as background to the main story. In this movie though, the atmosphere feels more prominent, which probably makes sense since the way all of these planets are different is an aspect that seems important. Just didn’t do much more for me though, especially tech and architecture wise. The dragonfly helicopters were cool though I thought those were really neat. 

I watched this in theaters, and I REALLY wish there were subtitles because so much of the dialogue was hard to make out. It felt frustrating, because I’m sure there were a lot of important things said, but missing out in that dialogue left me feeling disconnected from the scenes where I think I should have been more invested. A lot of characterization was definitely missed out, especially with Jessica. 

The number of scenes with Zendaya having her perfume commercial moment was kind of excessive, and the scenes with her character and Paul seemed forced. Maybe it being forced is how it should be, perhaps Paul gets more invested in this idea of Zendaya’s character than the reality and that creates the “forced” relationship in the future. I’m more rooting for them to be good friends rather than lovers, in any case.

I get the feeling there was a lot of context not in this movie that’s in the book that would better explain some scenes more. A lot of scenes were “okay this thing is happening I’m not sure why but sure” feeling.

By no means am I really dissing the book(s), honestly it’s just more of how the movie was shot and produced that caused my eh feeling about the movie. Beyond trying to figure out what was meant to be said and happen in scenes where I didn’t know, I don’t feel like I’ll want to interact with any Dune media going forward. I’m sure the story is great, it just wasn’t presented in a way that I find appealing, I guess",qd6vqv

I thought the sound design and CGI were great. I watched this at home in surround sound and I was very impressed with the soundtrack. I think I would have had a better appreciation for the visuals if I hadn't had to put up with the headache inducing Dolby Vision colorshift glitch that our Sony Bravia TV suffers from (though this seems to be the case across most of the Bravia product line). 

Costume design was good and I liked that each group had a pretty distinct style of dress though I think the jockstrap on the outside of the stillsuits was a bit overkill. IDK, I'm sure there are those out there who liked the inclusion but whatever. Loved the casting, this was a DEEP roster and there wasn't a single casting that I thought was bad and each of the performances was very well done. 

Here's my biggest complaint: The story. By no means is it completely bad. I'm struggling to find the right words to describe it but right now, it feels like I need to go and rewatch the movie to make sense of half the story because I kept getting lost in many of the scenes trying to understand what was said and what was going on. I would have appreciated a little bit more clear exposition and I suspect the average viewer who like me hasn't read the books will also struggle to follow along to some extent.",qd6vqv

I love Denis Villeneuve, but I really wish this was made into like a ten part mini series on HBO instead. It's just too big of an epic and felt there was a lot of compromises. And it's really hard to make a faithful adaptation of Dune because of all the internal dialogue that happens.

The movie was a lot like the book I didn't like that much lol

The purely visual/auditory parts are good, but I just wasn't captured by the characters or the story and it was missing the interesting concepts of the book that can't be translated to audio/visual medium

all in all, I won't ever watch this movie again and won't think about it very much except if the next one comes out and I guess I'll watch it because I like sci fi and most sci fi content is actual shit instead of just being something I don't like that much",qd6vqv

Lord of the rings had A LOT of walking. All Frodo does is walk. The difference however is that as Frodo is walking we get Sam and Golem, and we cut to Aragorn and Helms deep and check in with the heroes. 

In this movie we just get them walking. Or we get the scene where they save the people from the harvester, its cool but does it need to he stretched out so long.

As silly as the graphics look now in the Lynch version, I think the shield suits better conveyed why everyone was fighting hand to hand combat rather than shooting each other. 

And the Lynch look for the Bene Gessirit, and the ground he covered- even though it was all exposition, gave a better idea of who they were but I loved Rebecca Ferguson in this one.

The biggest issue is the structure and pacing.  This is essentially a 2.5-hour first act, and it feels like it.  ""This is just the beginning""...I assumed as much, as we ended on an incredibly anticlimactic note.  It's a problem that comes with the territory of a ""first chapter"" film, but still, films like Fellowship of the Ring and Force Awakens have demonstrated that you can be the introduction to a larger story and still function just fine as a standalone film.

hhl0lcu,"Great visuals, the sheer scope and scale of it is breathtaking. But on the other hand, this movie is one giant tease. What's the point even? It's like a feature length trailer for a movie that maybe gets made and doesn't come out for another 3-4 years. I'll have to say this is bad filmmaking if you can't tell a  complete story in a movie. If 2.5 hours isn't enough, then make it a 4-hour epic.",qd6vqv
hhl0li8,Just here to say how much I f'n loved this movie.,qd6vqv
hhl2658,"Just got back from a packed IMAX screening. On a Thursday. While it‘s currently on a streaming service. While we’re still in a pandemic.
The fact that blade runner 2049 didn’t have that.
Makes me have hope we’re getting that sequel. And that for the rest of his career Denis will just be given whatever he wants to keep making films.",qd6vqv
hhl2t5l,"Is it just me, or was there a severe lack of blood? Overall great movie though.",qd6vqv
hhl2vsq,That was dope,qd6vqv
hhl4afp,"I absolutely love this movie. Watching it in the Cinema is a feast. The settings are great and wondrous, and the characters are likeable.

I love that it is entertaining but serious. No forced jokes or humour, which almost seems mandatory for nowadays blockbusters.",qd6vqv
hhl4kks,"Loved this. One of my only gripes is WHAT'S WITH THE FRIGGIN ""LASERS""? Is 'laser+shield=family atomics' no longer a thing?",qd6vqv
hhl5f23,Kind of bummed we didn't get Batista vs Momoa,qd6vqv
hhl7mmc,"Spent the entire time feeling like the movie was about to end any second. It was very weird. The visuals were very beautiful though, and I liked what music I heard, but I'm not sold on the world or pacing yet.",qd6vqv
hhl87ge,"I finished watching this at home and I am still absorbing it. The entire thing was a cinematic vision that I rarely get to see, it was so vivid and enthralling. The visual statement was an incredible experience, and the overall mood and pacing of the film superb. I understand why others might not connect with something like this, but it's the exact kind of thing I look for in storytelling. It was a masterwork, I loved it.",qd6vqv
hhl9su6,"Big fan of the books and and DV’s blade runner 2042 is one of my favorite movies so I was PSYCHED for this. That being said, had trouble latching onto this one. Maybe because it’s only half the book or maybe because the later books are what I really want to see DV tackle. It was a great start tho. The worldbuilding was great and it didn’t go out of its way to hammer you over the head with explaining everything. I’ve read the book four times which didn’t help either since I knowing all the story beats makes nothing surprising. 

Really want this franchise to happen so we get to see the twins, the god emperor, Duncan Idaho gollum’s, facedancers, Miles Teg - so many amazing things to look forward to",qd6vqv
hhles03,They couldn't afford two gags huh?,qd6vqv

The rest of the movie = 8/10",qd6vqv
hhlly2s,"Yay, now that America has it, we are all allowed to talk about it :)",qd6vqv
hhlokx0,"As a 90s kid, I feel like this is as close to seeing Star Wars in 1977 as I’ve ever been. Just an amazing sci-fi epic with fantastic production design and scope. Can’t wait to see it again soon!",qd6vqv
hhlwff8,I need the Uncut version,qd6vqv
hhmbd3d,"This is how I felt after watching the first LotR movie. A sprawling epic in a new world that completely immersed me.

The wait for part 2 will be excruciating.",qd6vqv
hhme7eu,2.5 hours of world building that seemed kind of tedious. It was a beautiful film visually but at the end of it I thought to myself “wait that’s it?” Part 2 if it gets green lit should be a lot better.,qd6vqv
hhmkcfk,"Does anyone know what page the movie ends on? I wanna read the book but dont want a book bias going into the second movie 4 or 5 years from now

&#x200B;

Edit: Why is this downvoted seems like a logical question for someone that wants to read the books and not want my perception of part 2 to change",qd6vqv
hhn6n7o,Rebeca Ferguson was def a highlight for me.,qd6vqv
hhngfvq,"I think I figured out how to fix the movie, granted I liked a lot of it but the ending and last hour is what holds it back from being really great

It should have ended with Paul and Jessica escaping in the ornithopter and crashing landing in the desert, uncertain of the future as they venture towards the unknown. Paul should also have been the one to recite the litany of fear in this case too like in the book. Make it so he conquers his fear as a sort of conclusion to this part. He’s had these visions and dreams but know he realizes he must  accept them and use them. Part two could have opened up with the Fremen and the fight and solidified this as a new beginning not just for him but everyone else too.  

That gives us a few more minutes to flesh out the other parts and a better ending. The runtime doesn’t suffer but it removes pacing issues with the second hour. The first hour though is a masterpiece in world building and setting up the world",qd6vqv
hho0b3o,"I have many questions...

1. If humanity needs spice for interstellar travel, how did humans get to Arrakis in the first place?

2. How did humans gain abilities like mind control and floating?

3. Are the humans in this story originally from Earth?

4. I have some questions about the world at large. How many planets are there that are settled on? How many Houses are there? Is the Emperor an elected official or is he ruling the other houses?

5. Did the Emperor choose to destroy House Atreides just because the sandworm destroyed the spice truck?",qd6vqv
hho2kpg,"It's definitely an acquired taste. This won't be a movie for everyone. One thing I didn't like was how lengthy the scale shots were. yes, big desert, yes big ships, yes large armies. Those shots just did not get any shorter. They really wanted to show off how beautiful this movie is and that took much a lot of the time with transition shots.

Because of that mostly, I was almost bored. The world building is bloody great, I wasn't left behind on what this universe is like and why events are happening.

At the end of the movie, I wanted more.",qd6vqv
hho3mrl,"Loved it but I think part 1 needed more about the spacing guild, the Butlerian Jihad and mentats, just how harsh Arrakis is and how precious water is, what the spice does, how shields work, the baron's love life, etc. Some of these points can be covered later but most belong in part 1 and from what I hear Villeneuve doesn't want to make an extended version.",qd6vqv
hhoei49,Just saw it and I loved it. It was everything I wanted to see in a movie version of the book. I knew Villeneuve wouldn't disappoint. Part 2 can't come out soon enough.,qd6vqv
hhofzr5," Wow this movie was fantastic, hit every note, and was a good representation of the book unlike the 80's turd of a movie.

  I haven't liked Chalamet in anything before, but he was perfect here, same goes for Momoa. 

   All the other big actors like Ferguson & Isaac were great but expected that.

  Even the minor characters costumes looked amazing and the actors had top delivery, like The Herald and the Reverend Mother & Jamis.

 One of the best movies I've seen in many years.",qd6vqv
hhoh3me,What was everybody’s reaction to the opening quote? The “Dreams are messages from the deep” (something like that). It literally terrified the entirety of my theater,qd6vqv
hhoimy8,"When Josh Brolin looks at Jarvier Bardem and says “I don’t like him.” 

Heh, heh, heh.",qd6vqv
hhoiw9c,"Saw it in IMAX and loved it. The epic sense of grandeur was spectacular to behold. I don't normally go for a monochromatic aesthetic but it totally worked for me in this movie. The monumental architecture, costumes and overall production design were perfect. 

I was surprised by how sparse the dialogue was in a movie almost three hours long. I actually think Rebecca Ferguson's character had the most lines out of anyone. For a movie based on half a book with a shit ton of plot and exposition, I think Denis Villeneuve and Co. did a great job of adapting it for screen without overwhelming the audience with cryptic terminology. Can't wait to see Part II.",qd6vqv
hhokmyc,"The movie was 2 and a half hours, and yet it only felt like the opening act. The pace was good, even though there are parts there that should feel slow, somehow they don't. The suspense was done so well, I never felt it dragged.

I'm pumped for the sequel(s)",qd6vqv
hhoo2ff,"So I never read the books, I remember my mom loved the old movies. She got me into it. 


This movie is easily the best movie I’ve seen all year and honestly I loved Denis’s sequel to Blade Runner - I rewatch it pretty often. 

This was amazing, scale, acting, foreshadowing, effects. Only gripe is that I wish it were R rated.",qd6vqv
hhop6o8,"I've read the book, seen the DL version, and watched Jodorowsky's Dune but haven't seen this yet. 2 questions:

1. How is Timothy Chalamet as Paul? Looking at the cast, he was my biggest concern.
2. Is this movie worth a 30 minute drive to an iMax?",qd6vqv
hhp4k78,I watched at home and it visually felt like that episode of game of thrones where you couldn’t see anything,qd6vqv
hhp66yt,"I didn’t really like the movie and I feel like an idiot for it tbh. I didn’t get what was going on or what was being said a lot of the time, and when some things happened I was just like, ok then. Happy to see others enjoyed it. I had no idea what the movie even was going into it either so the lack of knowledge probably aided me in disliking it.",qd6vqv
hhpb6hv,"Ok does no one review the movie before releasing? So much whispering over loud music. I couldn't understand at times. 

Otherwise I enjoyed it plus Rebecca Ferguson is bad ass

So I don't think I really understand the emperor's plan. So he ordered that other house to leave the planet and then told the other family to go to the desert planet and then had them killed them on the desert planet",qd6vqv
hhpe7et,"I wish they gave Yueh more development into why he set forward with becoming a traitor instead of a one of sentence saying it because of his wife. There wasn’t any remorse in his character like it was in the book and would’ve felt more impact when he died

Other than that, amazing movie. The Voice sound design was amazing.",qd6vqv
hhpe9fx,"As someone who has spent extensive amounts of time in the desert, the lack of headwear by all the male characters bothered me. Yeah I get why they’re not wearing them. The same reason why the main characters never wear helmets in medieval movies.

But I still couldn’t stop thinking about it every time they were in the sun.",qd6vqv
hhpln2e,"They killed the adaptation. I’m surprised they were as faithful as they were. The spitting scene really seemed to confuse the crowd in my theater. Other than a few omissions, I have zero complaints.

Really impressed by the cast, everyone did a fantastic job. The soundtrack, visuals, cinematography and scope were just magnificent, wish I would have seen it in iMax.

10/10 for me, really hoping the sequel is green light. My theater was pretty full.",qd6vqv
hhpq3zw,"I thought the movie was really good. The score, production and sound design, and cast were all top notch. This was one of the most visually and sonically pleasing movies I’ve seen in a long time. Also, the movie was quite faithful to the book, which I was happy about.

If I had one complaint, it would have to be the pacing. Even as the first part of a (hopefully) two-part story, this movie felt a bit rushed at times. Sometimes it felt like we were moving from one beautiful montage to the next, and if I hadn’t read the book, I would feel lost. Part of me wonders if this would have worked better as a TV show, to allow the story to breath a bit more. However, then the budget and cast probably wouldn’t be nearly as good. And we wouldn’t get to see the story on the big screen. Aside from that, I’m overall very pleased with the movie.

On a side note, did anyone feel like the ADR was off at times? Like, there were times where I could tell when an actor’s lines were re-recorded in-post, and the lines being said didn’t match up with the lips of the actor. I don’t usually notice this in movies, but for some reason I noticed it in Dune.",qd6vqv
hhprcfz,"Loved it, feel like the pacing will alienate casual viewers...but as a person who read the books I think it warrants it given the density of information they are tasked with taking in.

Much better than the Lynch version and it's going to be a real shame if they don't make the sequel...imo, Dune isn't really good till Messiah. The build up isn't as satisfying as seeing it all crumble and I think as a franchise it will have legs and continue to make money for them long term...but business is run on quarterly.

Every frame was pure ecstasy...loved it.

Had a few issues with catching dialogue...but not a major issue. Nothing that would have you losing plot and not as frequent as big offenders like Tenet.",qd6vqv
hhpsldj,This movie is a masterpiece,qd6vqv
hhptlsr,"Incredible. Absolutely incredible. Every shot was a work of art, every emotional beat landed perfectly. I was absorbed into the world from beginning to end. If this doesn't get a Part II, it'll be a crime against humanity.",qd6vqv
hhpuvg4,"I resisted the urge to watch it on HBO the moment it came out and went and saw it in an IMAX theater tonight. Absolutely a breathtaking experience and I’m glad to have seen it in the way I did.

I’ve read the book series 3 times now and I loved how much detail they managed to put into the movie. I know a lot of inner dialogue got cut but they managed to portray quite a bit of it on screen without being weird and I think it worked. I went with a friend who’d never read the books or seen the original movie and the only real complaint was how the movie ended, but with it being billed as “part 1” it’s kinda understandable. 

I really really hope that there’s a part 2 to this.",qd6vqv
hhpw583,Went in knowing only about 10% of Dune lore and really enjoyed it. Definitely gotta see more movies in IMAX now.,qd6vqv
hhqfppz,"Caught it in imax last night and really enjoyed it. To be honest, I enjoyed BR2049 a bit more, but my bias towards that is wrapped up in a far more enjoyable and stacked evening.

But this (as many have probably pointed out) has a strange distinction as being a film that has to have an asterisk (*) bound to it until we hear word about the sequel: For how great it looks and sounds, I don’t  think I’ll be able to enjoy a rewatch knowing it won’t be continued.",qd6vqv
hhqtexp,"I can’t be the only one who likes this movie more than the book right?


It just feels better, the stakes are amped, the emotional moments feel better written to me.",qd6vqv
hhqzt1y,"The pace of the movie was a bit slower and at times choppier than I expected. They definitely didn’t do a good job stressing how critical spice really is to current universal civilization with the upper class basically dying if they stop taking it, it’s extending life, mentats, etc.  Also, paul being trained as a mentat. I wish they spent more time letting them get settled on Arrakis and giving Kynes some more screen time. 

I was really amped up for the movie and felt a little let down. Need to give it another watch.",qd6vqv

hhtn9y7,"Saw this in true IMAX tonight. Loved it, my only memory of Dune was being scared watching the original when I was 6/7 years old. This was like interstellar/Star Wars/Blade Runner. The first 80% of the film was 9/10. The last 20% was a little meh and underwhelming compared to the rest of the film. Just not sure they should have slowed it down to the extent they did, seemed to drag a little.",qd6vqv
hhtrgiy,"The worst part about this movie, is the fact we are waiting 3 more years for part 2. This is borderline criminal!",qd6vqv
hhu8do9,I liked it. Scripts a way stripped down version of the book though. Wondering what people who didn't read the book think of it.,qd6vqv
hhub8yu,"I watched it at a late hour so the run time was killing me, I was having a hard time staying awake, but I adore fantasy, magical world, best movie of the year, maybe even last couple years, the actors all looked so sexy. Timothy chalamet is too attractive for this world. Diplomatic highborne, a mind so powerful it can alter space time, past, present, and bring a better future. The emperor was interesting. Spice becomes the most valuable commodity in the galaxy that's so earthy and relatable, desert cinematography is beautiful.",qd6vqv
hhvefan,"I think this was a good movie, but it's hard to pass judgment when it just ends without anything happening.  I get that it's just Part One, but it would have been nice if it had its own small arc and conclusion.  As good as the movie may be, it's designed to leave you unsatisfied.",qd6vqv

Sounds like you’re watching dune’ and they responded with ‘no, trolls 2.’  And after having watched dune after that convo, honestly, I still would have made the same mistake",qd6vqv
hhwutes,What a movie. Can’t wait for part 2…. Or I’ll just read the books idk,qd6vqv
hhynm2u,"My take on this film is that it was something for sure. but it could have been alot more. 

There was about 20 minutes of slow movement/ephemeral minutes that could have been swapped with more battle details, House Harkonnen scenes, or back story on other histories. It was a bit too long, but the visuals were top notch as expected. If this franchise is going to be on par with the original Star Wars trilogy it needs more pace.",qd6vqv
hhzvm11,"I thought it was fucking fantastic.  So good.  This director may be one of my favorites after these movies.  What a ride.

I'm currently reading the book and I would've been lost with all the visions. 

I liked the music but it made me feel like something big was about to happen which got tiring. 

There wasn't much urgency in the story but that's how it is in the book as well so I can't really fault the movie. 

I think I let myself get overhyped for this movie. I've really enjoyed Villeneuve's other movies so I had high hopes.",qd6vqv

It was visually stunning (as one would expect from a Villeneuve movie), acting was terrific, and the movie was actually paced surprisingly well for being 2.5 hours. My only real complaints were that some of the dialogue was very whispery/muttered which was hard to understand, and having read the book the story definitely  moved very quickly.

hi2u935,"Bladerunner 2049 was the best movie theater experience I’ve ever had in my life when I first watched in Dolby Cinema. Denis became my current favorite director, so when BR2049 flopped it broke my heart, because I thought we’d never see more of this grand scale. 

And then Denis lands mothafuckin Dune, and absolutely crushes it. It is beautiful in IMAX with Laser, and I have to agree my biggest gripe is that it ENDS! My mom said it was too slow. But I thought it was too short haha. I love the books, and the original movie is great. But this movie is legit Lord of the Rings tier adaptation for me. 

I have watched again on my 65” 4K OLED in Dolby Vision with booming Atmos. And yeah it’s not IMAX with Laser, that was amazing. My Laser IMAX is 1.9 so sadly I’m heart broken I’ll never get to see this in 1.43:1 like any real Dune fan would. 

I love this universe. This shit was written in the 60’s and still makes Game of Thrones look like a poser when it comes to world building and exposition. 

I loved it. Thank you Denis and everyone that went into making this masterpiece. Now make the first story complete already Legendary and WB. Stop dicking around and give me more.

Also Hans killed the soundtrack. It’s great seeing how passionate he was about Dune to begin with and it really translates through. I hope this movie is an Award darling for Director, Soundtrack, Cinematography and Visual Effects. This years Fury Road IMHO",qd6vqv

hhmmt1u,"Hey guys , I watched Dune yesterday at the movies(wanted to really support the project)  
I give it a solid 8/10.  
That being said I have some gripes with it.  
1)Lady Jessica - What they did to the character here really bothered me. While reading the book Jessica always seemed to be in control of most situations, I rarely remember a moment where she seemed fragile, only when Paul actually took some control late in the book is where she slid back into a more back role to Paul.  
In the Movie Lady jessica seemed very fragile and emotional , which is fine but for me it just didn't work as an adaptation of the Book character. This for me was a big problem.  
2)The Sardaukar - In the book they seem to be elite fighters and that was somewhat shown in the movie. But what killed me was in the invasion of Arrakis the Atreides fighters were holding the line then the Sardaukar roped down behind them and right as they did , they screamed ""Sardaukar!""(or maybe someone else screamed , not sure right now). This bothered due to the fact that the presence of sardaukar in the invasion was to be a secret , so no one could link this to the Emperor. So two things bother me here, first if they did scream their name , why do they do that? It made no sense , second why are they using specific sardaukar clothing , if the idea was to be inconspicuous shouldn't they be desguised?  
For me in the book they realized sardaukar were there due to the way they fought(this is even mentioned by Duncan Idaho in the movie) but in the movie they literally look different so the whole ""secret"" about them makes no sense.  
3) Sequel is still not confirmed - BIGGEST gripe about this , how in the fuck do the execs at warner approve this movie knowing the script ends like this and still have not greenlit the sequel? I makes absolutely no sense. And it does hamper my enjoyment of this a little bit. I remember being in the movies after the first LOTR movie , and seeing some people leaving really hating the movie and frustraded because nothing is resolved after the first movie , I didn't feel like this because I knew it was 1 first part of 3 and that they were basically done and would just be released with 1 year difference. The way Dune works I simply cannot recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a fan of the book because there is no resolution whatsoever and we don't even know if there will be one , and if there is... it's gonna be at least what 2 - 2,5 year from now?  
Anyway that being said , if you care about the book , I recommend it.",qd6vqv
hhncmnf,Well that was fucking phenomenal.,qd6vqv

hhp8f25,"Going to go against the grain and say that the 80’s version captured some feel of the book better. This was more accurate overall, for sure, but I feel like there wasn’t enough character time for me to care when certain characters died. Like it was a long movie, and spent a lot of time on tracking shots, but interesting relationships was not something it spent time on. 

Whereas Jurgen Prochnow, Patrick Stewart, the Baron in the 80s movie—they all stood out and had an emotion to them. Everyone in this movie was great at being moody and serious, but it felt completely emotionless.",qd6vqv

hhrl017,"Second viewing on the small screen this time, and this time I'm far more leaned in for that first hour. Far more invested in it than I was the first time.

The next 1.5 hours lost me. It jumps between scenes, locations, and characters so quickly and too many scenes linger while others are there and out.

Beautiful film. Would love more, but a regular pacing would be nice for more than 4 minutes.",qd6vqv
hhrrvt6,"Never read the books, but boy do I love this movie and want more. The pacing for the movie is done incredibly well, it doesn't feel like you're overwhelmed with lore and jargon, but drop them off bit by bit to keep you interested and aware of what's going on. Technical aspects such as the movie's visuals, cinematography, and sound editing are just top notch. 

That said, shouldn't Paul be more fit looking? He said he has been training his whole life and he's a very capable fighter. Seemed like he should had a slim, athletic built?",qd6vqv
hhtefq8,"I loved it. I've been waiting for a Dune movie since I first read the book back in 2007. I'm curious why they cut the part of the Harkonnen plot which had House Atreides question Lady Jessica's loyalty, as that is something that pays off later in the book. Beggars can't be choosers though, this was a really solid adaption.",qd6vqv
hhtosg5,"I loved the pacing of this film, I mean all they had to do was follow the book, but I was reminded how nice it is to get a slow buildup and introduction to the world rather than the usual Hollywood crappy writing covered up by explosions every 5 minutes. Usually I am so fatigued halfway through all those new style action/comic movies but I could have easily sat through another hour of this. I was really surprised when it ended.",qd6vqv
hhttfmv,I loved it but I can tell it's a movie that expects you to know some shit before watching and a lot of people new to dune will have some blank spaces that need filling like what mentats are and what their role is among other things.,qd6vqv
hhu04lb,"Don’t really have much more to add that others haven’t already said but I really liked it. I think it’s a movie I’ll appreciate even more on subsequent rewatches. Visuals and soundtrack were both incredible. Sound mixing was questionable in a few scenes and I feel I would’ve been confused a few times if I hadn’t read the book. 

My only complaint is that it (unavoidably) was only half a story and we won’t get the second half for at least 2-3 years. Hopefully in the meantime we get a director’s cut for the home video release. Has to be a lot of great footage on the cutting room floor",qd6vqv

hhulp5v,"Villeneuve and Chris Nolan often get compared , without there being really much similarity in their style.  I think it's just kind of, the two guys who make  actually good, non franchise, movies on big budgets.

This was the first time something Villenueve made felt like something Nolan would make, to me.",qd6vqv
hhupiaj,"Was anyone else bothered by the scene in which Shadouta Mapes took the Crysknife out to show it to Lady Jessica? In the books you're supposed to draw blood every time you take it out of its sheath, according to tradition. When she put it back without doing so I was taken aback.

It's such a simple detail that would've only taken a few seconds of screen time, so it can't have been for efficiency reasons. It just feels so cheap, like they didn't pay attention.",qd6vqv
hhv49kv,"The audio mix in my IMAX was really poor, I couldn't understand probably 50-60% of the dialogue. As a non-Dune fan, I have to rewatch it on HBO Max with subtitles, which is frustrating since it shouldn't be an either-or situation for Dune. I'd love to just be able to understand dialogue while also seeing the movie in its ideal format.",qd6vqv
hhv8j9z,"Saw last night. Everything in the movie is well shot. But, there isn't enough character.

The last fight. ""Paul has never killed a man before"". This should be a tough moment, we should see Paul battle within himself. But, he quickly and coldly performs a trick move to kill the freman. 

After this, in the book, Paul sheds tears at the freman's funeral. Which, among the freman, is unheard of. Ofc Paul doesn't understand. But, it would further cement the sacredness of water on Arrakis. Yes, they have special suits. Yes those Parm trees are ""Sacred."" But Paul is shown throughout calmly stood in the open with no protection with no visible signs of dehydration. (Cracked lips, sweating.)    

The soundtrack. The ""sound"" of Zimmers score is captivating. But the actual content of it. It feels like 2 complete tracks, stretched over an almost 3 hour movie. Either drones, or well designed drums.   
  
Now, Zimmer shouldn't have written like John Williams either. It would become Star Wars. But the harmony, the writing of it, should have developed further. Instead, with either drone or bombastic drums, Zimmer reflected the stark desolate Arrakis, but failed to connect emotionally with the characters.

I love the books. But, this beautiful movie falls short of a lot. Hoping that Denis evaluates this film and improves for part 2. Which I still genuinely look forward to.",qd6vqv

hhyqu1s,"It's about as good an adaptation of that book as is possible.  I am not a fan of the book though, and most of its flaws are present here as well.  None of that is to say it's a bad movie--far from it!--just that being true to its source material is more of a weakness than a strength in this case.

I've always liked the *ideas* in Dune (the novel specifically I'm talking about here), and the general worldbuilding.  This concept of the messiah story subverted is great stuff, setting it in this world that is both under the thumb of civilization and much more powerful than the forces trying to control it, it's really sophisticated stuff.  It's a shame it's populated with such flat characters, that it makes such a routine of going through the motions to drag the plot from one story beat to the next, that the dialogue is so wooden, and that it never quite finds its tone or any kind of pace that makes sense.  

The movie stumbles headlong into the flat characters and wooden dialogue, man.  Every character feels like they're pretty much just along for the ride that the plot is taking them on, and they're saying the words that the movie fates have prescribed for them.  None of this is to say that they're poorly acted.  In fact, I'm surprised at just how well they make this dialogue *almost* work.  Who but Oscar Isaac can take dialogue that just boils down to the most stereotypical benevolent ruler cliche, and deliver it in a way that makes the character *not* insufferable.  How does Josh Brolin turn grouchy-military-man cliche into something compelling?  I don't know man.  I'm impressed and disappointed at the same time.  Disappointed because I was really hoping that the movie might inject some more life into these characters, but impressed because despite leaving them as the bland as they always were, the movie still makes them kinda work.

The pacing though is a *huuuuuuge* improvement over the novel.  I suppose it sort of had to be, but it's still nice to see.  

And of course, visually it's stunning.  90% of my enjoyment of the movie is purely down to the wide-eyed spectacle of the thing.  That's less a matter of dismissing the other elements, and more a matter of saying that visually it really is just fantastic.  The big sweeping vistas are the obvious shots, but also all of the weird details.  The Bene Gesserit matron who tests Paul is terrifying in her veil, because there's just the hint that something might not be *right* about her face.  The healing goop that the Baron is submerged in is wondrously disgusting.  

The sound work is surprisingly effective as well.  The music is mostly excellent (even if the chanting is used as punctuation on dramatic lines a little too much for my liking), the various languages work within the setting, the different *types* of voices are a nice touch.  Also, I was impressed with how ""the voice"" is depicted.  I love that it sounds positively ghostly, that it's not the stereotypical kind of commanding voice you would expect, and that even coming from Paul, its tone is decidedly feminine.  

Whether the ideas live up to the expectations will have to wait until we have the rest of the story done.  As it is, I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it as pure audio-visual spectacle, not so much as a story.  But man, that spectacle carries it *far*.",qd6vqv
hi0y1y5,"Epic in every sense of the word. Villeneuve really succeeded in creating a vast living, breathing world.

I really appreciated the film's lack of exposition. Concepts like Mentats were alluded to without feeling the need relying on a heavy-handed expositional monologue explaining their role and purpose. Rather than explaining how culture works, Villeneuve invites us to experience first hand.

This lack of in-your-face exposition really imbues Dune's universe with a naturalistic sense of life that extends beyond Paul's story. Fans of the books can pick up on kernels of information / allusions that may go over the heads of others, while film-only viewers can fully immerse themselves and slowly piece together how the world works through context clues without being constantly reminded that this is a film by in-your-face exposition dumps.",qd6vqv
hi1a5n9,So I went into this movie blind and all I can say is god damn. 9/10 and I’d probably give it a 10 if certain scenes i could actually hear what they’re saying so may rewatch it on hbo max for subtitles. I thought the universe was incredibly interesting especially the bene gesserit. I felt the anxiety that everybody else did when ever one of them was on the sceeen. And I think the voice power was brilliant and really interesting.,qd6vqv
hi4sbv1,"Personally, I don’t get how anyone would be upset that they didn’t get closure from part 1. That movie left me begging for another 4. Idgaf how many sequels, that was so awesome!

-Great world building
-Good political conflict
-Cool power system with “the voice”
-Cool technology

Cons:
-hand to hand combat with the invisible shields were confusing
-the politics were kinda confusing at times (had to pause and Wikipedia a few things) 
-the guy who betrayed Duke Leto was a moron for thinking he’d get his wife back (felt weird watching that play out)

They’ll be talking about this in film school for decades. 

I watched BR 2049 again before seeing Dune. That one took me a few watches to fully appreciate how great it is. May be in the top 5 of all time sci-fi. 

I feel I will need to see Dune a few more times to get the story. Visually better than Star Wars which is insane to say. Some of the best mega-space crafts on film. The only thing it lacks is a future mega-city but it’s not that kind of story. 

It’s really exciting to be watching a directors career like this in real time. It’s hard to explain how great this three film series for him is.",qd6vqv
hkafg7y,"Definitely good. Some things hold it back from being great. The visuals, world building, music/sound, basically the atmosphere are masterful. Usually great acting really helped by the stacked and enjoyable cast. The different creatures and sci-fi tech kept intriguing me.

hneigoe,"Cool movie, underrated and visually stunning. Went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised, the 2 1/2 hours didn't seem that long. Plenty of worse films have received a better critical response.

hvxa5rz,"Why did I buy this movie as opposed to renting it. 

Aside from 2021 special effects it clearly has the 'feels' of the cheesiest 2000s movies. 

Long drawn out scenes, outdated movie scenes and perhaps 2015 special effects and I am still watching this. 

I read all of the Frank Herbert books until Brian took over.. this movie is a hideous representation of his vision as portrayed in the books.

 Holy hell, why is much hellishly worse than the 1984 adaptation.. I do not get it. It has some of favorite actors but they totally butchered this 1/2 of the first book when it supremely ended at 3 books.. I have little faith that this should go on.",qd6vqv

It seems that there are several concerns from book readers here, but I had zero problems with the pacing, and as non book reader I feel they explined but most imporantly showed everything important you need to understand the universe and characters. I hope the second part comes soon enough, I really want to jump to the books but I'll gladly wait for another well crafted movie.",qd6vqv
hhkl3ht,"I read the books and I think this was a pretty good adaptation. Obviously it's different, since book and movie formats require different types of storytelling. The book itself has too many sub plots to fully adapt to the screen. But it looks like **it's keeping the heart of the story in-tact, which is important**. For how much happens in book one, two parts is definitely needed for a movie. I can see people who haven't read the book *might* fight it boring if they don't know all the action that's about to come in the next part. My one major gripe is replacing ""Jihad"" with ""holy war."" Just don't sound as cool.",qd6vqv

hhxe1i0,"While at the end of the day the movie was great and very beautifully shot and great locations and very good CGI. I felt like it fell into the Denis Villeneuve Syndrome where it had overly long and unnecessary shots that could have lowered the run time by 30 mins without missing anything. Especially the Zendaya ones were pretty useless for the plot, the Babs Olusanmokun ones were very good it showed us how he thought Paul how to adapt to the desert but Zendaya's one felt like the same thing over and over again just slow motion recordings of her ""existing"", the first one made me understand she is important to the plot, even made me realize she will be his wife but the remaining 99 felt rather annoying.

Overall great movie, very well done and I am looking forward for the next part might even be the best movie of the year so far. I just found the ""flashbacks"" with Zendaya rather overused and kinda pointless.",qd6vqv

I feel like how much you enjoy Dune will depend on how much you enjoyed Blade Runner, which is polarized among audience too.As I'm rather impatient, I don't think the movie needed to be that long because after 2.5 hours I still feel like not much happened. I don't know how much book focused on characters in comparison, but they weren't interesting to watch. I know this isn't the end of Dune, but for a 2.5 hour long movie the payoff was unsatisfying and not worth it. On the bright side tho, it was cool to see how Dune influenced Star Wars. That particular voice scene on dragonfly helicopter was the highlight and love them sandworms. I'm gonna pass on the sequels tho",qd6vqv

This was everything I wanted and then some. Just glorious from start to finish, and seeing it in IMAX was such the right call. The way they utilized “The Voice” was fucking wild.

I didn’t know anything about Dune going in. It was gorgeous, sounded beautiful, wonderfully acted and DAMN that world building was awesome. I wanted more content, to see more technology, more houses, get into the world! My only complaints are minor. It leaves you hanging for that part 2 and oh gosh do I have to wait for part 2. It also MAYBE hard to follow for people that don’t watch a lot of sci-fi/fantasy stuff and understand tropes or aren’t able to understand and follow names of the houses etc. 

The only thing I really learned from the other threads is
>!Paul is special, but there is not a chosen one, it doesn’t exist and merely an idea that has been manipulated into the populations minds and his visions aren’t just visions. He sees multiple future outcomes and can choose where he wants to go. !<

Such a fantastic watch. I watched on HBO and definitely cheated myself. I will be near an IMAX next week and will be making a special side trip to see it properly.

Edit: I have to read the books. I realized I’m already so invested. Haven’t been this excited about sci-fi since The Expanse and this even more so since it has some Warhammer 40k vibes and is a bit for fantastical.",qd6vqv

I have no doubt it's omitting a ton, as it's often the case with any adaptation of a novel, but what they chose to spend time with was interesting and well made.

People have suggested a TV series being a better format for this, but a TV series doesn't get this budget and thus this production value. You can't ""Mandalorian"" or ""Game of Thrones"" your way into a universe this large and nuanced, and get this level of detail. I for one, I'm glad this is a movie that I could watch on the big screen.

I'm definitely looking forward for more. I wonder what would Alejandro Jodorowsky make of it.",qd6vqv
hhkwmlb,"Saw an early screening for this and have been dying to talk about it for a bit. 

Having known very little about the story prior to seeing it, I haven’t had an experience seeing a movie like this since I first watched the Star Wars movies as a kid.

Cannot wait for the next part",qd6vqv
hhky36g,So many to discuss yet the hand in the box scene really resonated with me. It's handled okay in the Lynch version but this one is on a totally different level. Chalamet's emotional transition from pain to defiance really set the tone. No need for fancy effects or whatnot. From what I gathered it's a fantastic and very important scene from the book that any adaptation should NOT fuck up.,qd6vqv
hhky6p6,"Really liked this one….  Never read the source material, but I get the feeling Denis really went all in on world building..it made for a much richer experience. 

However, my concern is that it might come at the expense at advancing the plot.   As some have joked; it has the feel of a few episodes/a season of a TV show, as opposed to a film…I get that sense as well, and I’m wondering how conclusively this can be wrapped up in another 2.5-3 hour film.


As I’ve said, I’ve never read the source material, but if part two ends the plot of the first book in the Dune series well enough.. will that leave audiences satisfied…. Or is the series at large needed to fully appreciate the story.   Should Dune have been a series, or if the two part film, just covering that first novel is all we ever get (both to the quality of this first film), will non-readers be satisfied?

However, Denis is one of my favorite directors, so I gave it a chance, and I'm super happy I did. Obviously the cast is great, but the world building is insanely gorgeous. The sound and score are both incredible as well. While I liked BR 2049, I felt the pacing was the weakest element of that film, here, I didn't feel that way at all.

Movie theaters shouldn't have a stranglehold on new movies just because they've been around for over a century. That being said, movie theaters have a place for if you want to watch a movie on a better setup than you could ever have. The theater industry deserves a massive downsizing, but it shouldn't die out. If you wanted a perfect example of the kind of movie you must go to a theater to properly experience, Dune is that example. The full surround sound enhanced the experience in ways I can't describe, and the size of the screen I saw it on made the wider scenes feel truly epic and absorbing. 

And that's not even getting to the movie itself. Amazing acting, good writing, beautiful set pieces and visual effects, and having a feeling of being an adaptation without feeling like much was lost. I don't blame you for seeing this on HBO Max, but this movie was absolutely worth shelling out extra money for the ""premium experience"".",qd6vqv

Meh on everything else. Casting was terrible, I did like Oscar Isaac though.

hhms9pl,"I despise the novel, but I knew from the moment Dennis Villeneuve was announced as director I was going to love the movie, and I was right. Villeneuve brilliantly cut away the fat (and deemphasized the more dated and cringey parts of the book) allowing the sweeping, genius scale and vision of Herbert's story to shine. 

Dune is better with less exposition. Villeneuve just let it be weird and mysterious and awe-inspiring and that was wonderful. Not a perfect movie, by any means, but a truly satisfying one (as long as we get part 2)",qd6vqv
hhnq81o,"Herbert has some cool world building, but some of the stuff in it always makes me scratch my head. Like the Hunter Seeker...if it's being operated remotely by someone nearby then why should it matter if Paul is standing still? Like couldn't someone seem him regardless?

Also the carry all transport for the spice harvester. Like why don't they just build those balloons onto the harvester so it can take off itself? Seems like that design was written to fit the plot, but idk.",qd6vqv
hho3v9f,"Wow. Already at 5k posts! That was quick.  
I'm going to copy my Facebook post on this, so the writing is focused differently than a normal post here but I'm lazy.

DUNE IS A TRUMPH.

DUNE IS A TRIUMPH.d\*) time's the charm in adapting Frank Herbert's massive ""unfilmable"" movie to the screen. Denis Villeneuve is able to avoid the pitfalls of the previous attempts and create something huge and heart-stirring, and mind-bending impressive on all counts.   
I've not seen something this ambitious, grandiose, and other-worldly feeling and just EPIC in a long time.

  
The issue in adapting Dune is it's a dense book. All the detail of world-building, strangeness, and sci-fi Proper Noun Important Things and People can easily get overwhelming. The writing team is mostly able to cut through to the heart of the story. I will admit, some character development is lost along with the way. But I'm not sure how much will be missed by those who haven't read the source. But let's also be honest, most of the characters outside the central one - Paul and Jessica, aren't deep. We just get more time with them in the written form. There may be pushback that this is part 1 of a 2 part story. Yes, much of what we see is set-up but the focus on Paul's dreams does allow a Part One arc, and it does stop at the right spot (though not the spot I expected). When it does end, it's much a surprise. The pacing is so exact the 2h33m flew by. 

  
As it is for any well-loved series gets adapted, there will be purists who get mad this or that part or aspect gets removed or quickly passed (one of these was sitting behind me), but I think this one really balances respect for the source along with getting it accessible and interesting for General Audiences. 

  
That doesn't mean the sheer Weird Fiction of DUNE is gone, the film still bleeds weird but doesn't overwhelm and push off into the esoteric. The Harkonnens, Bene Gesserit, and the rest are just as WTF as expected (The guild navigator that quickly turned the tide of Lynch's is left off-screen, a smart choice of knowing where the lin for many might be). The wonderful production design, costumes, and holy shit the sound design (The Voice!) is wonderfully odd and strange. Every aspect is just perfect in this manner. Even if you're not into the story, the visual and audio will drop your jaw. 

  
Hans Zimmer's score is astounding and perfectly matched the look and tone of the film. One for the books.   
Speaking of perfectly matched, the casting is perfect. Timothy Chalamet' is great as Paul, trying to find who is he is among everything going on, resisting the call others are making for him (I like how they're handling the iffy topic of white savior messiah; a concept that discussing further would spoil the movies and the series). Rebecca Ferguson continues to be amazing in everything (still chilled from her Doctor Sleep go as Rose the Hat), my space boifriand Oscar Isaac brings gravity to Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard is delightedly Brando in Apocalypse Now slimy. The rest of the cast from Jason Momoa to Josh Brolin and everyone down the line are very suited. 

  
Yes, DUNE delivers. After being disappointed in HALLOWEEN KILLS and NO TIME TO DIE in the last two weeks, it's a joy to be so entralled and thrilled by DUNE. 

  
\*I recommend watching JODOROWSKY'S DUNE, a ""making-of"" for an adaptation by the Chilian cult-film director's attempt. Fascinating.",qd6vqv
hhoazc2,Okay any other book readers internally fill in their inner thoughts? I freaking love this movie.,qd6vqv
hhodp8k,They did not mention how baron is lady jessicas dad and pauls grandpa…. Like how can you leave out all that drama??!!? Also the part when he kills jamis at the end theirs a whole water recovery funeral for it and Paul starts to cry and everyone respects him more for that because he sheds water for the dead and it was an important thing to Interlay the importance of water for the fremen. I wanted to like the movie and theirs definitely amazing aspects to it but I feel like it could have been so much better.,qd6vqv
hhon872,I really loved this film. My only issue was the combat. Just didn't give me the impression that any hit actually landed? I'll have to watch it again on HBO Max to get a better understanding of my own issue lmao,qd6vqv
hhp58ug,Dune is amazing. That is all,qd6vqv
hhpgf9z,"So I just got out of seeing it for the first time. By the way, I was also able to finish the book right before seeing the film, so the story was very fresh.  
  
With that said…I freaking LOVED this movie. Even where they decided to end it I was totally on-board.

Knee-jerk 1st reaction: This is one of the best movies I’ve seen IN A LONG TIME.",qd6vqv
hhpiqls,"So I'll preface this by saying I've read none of the books nor have I seen any prior adaptations, my understanding is the book came out before a lot of currently popular sci-fi franchises and served as an influence on them (more knowledgable people than myself, feel free to correct me on that).

I think my favorite thing about this was the world building, this is the first sci-fi film in a long time where the universe felt truly lived in and alien while also familiar in a sense. The production design and VFX were outstanding, and I somewhat regret not seeing this in IMAX for the visuals alone.

Having said that...story-wise it felt very familiar. Very much the ""Chosen One/Hero's Quest"" narrative that has been done ad infinitum, with supporting characters essentially existing just to help the main character along his quest. While I *love* pretty much every member of the main cast, a lot of them felt very one-dimensional.

I'll also say it was a bold move in my book to >!essentially dare/force WB to green-light part two with the way it ended, not to mention calling it ""Part One"" at the very beginning. While I get the purpose of it, it does basically leave this entire film feeling like setup, setup, setup.!<.

I honestly did like it, I think it's the most accessible sci-fi film Villeneuve has made but also falls into tropes and very familiar narratives (again, considering the source material perhaps this is to be expected). I'll be curious where part two goes if (when) it happens.",qd6vqv
hhpo1xd,Honestly the way they treated the narrative is a lot like how that real live action dragon ball z movie did that came out a while back lol,qd6vqv
hhpz418,"never read the books, didn't have a clue what it was about apart from something about ""spice"" and ""sandworms""

totally enjoyed it, i may actually go and see it again. if you get the chance go and see it in a cinema, not on HBO or whatever it's on...it deserves better than your shitty TV and sound system.

the design and feel of the universe was fucking spot on and knocked it out of the park, on the sand planet (not sure how to spell it haha) everything felt old and worn, practical and real and very very interesting to look at, in the same way that Avatar did a great job with the design of the planet and the vehicles.",qd6vqv
hhqx6mo,"my review in bullet-points:

* Chalamet was actually kinda good, I'm usually not enthralled by him as an actor but, he did good.
* Other than that the whole cast was amazing. Obvious highlights for me were Rebecca Ferguson, Brolin, and Stellan, but everyone was really really good. 
* I wish the plot in the first half focused a bit more on Leto and Jessica. In the book Leto is such an interesting character, I really valued his perspective and wish they spent more time with his relationship to Jessica... But the movie was long as fuck so I understand.
* I did NOT like how Liet Kynes died, I wish it was more like the book. Her death in the book really dials in to how much the Fremen love their planet, and their ultimate wish to terraform. Kynes resigns themselves to the desert, it just felt more appropriate. 
* I didn't think they'd show the hooks or Fremen riding worms, that was cool.
* The way Barron killed Yueh, my goodness, that was fantastic.
* The entire sequence of the attack on Arakeen was incredible. Loved that scene where the Atreides fighters hold off the Harkonnens before the Sardaukar finish them off.
* Visually a stunning movie, the Voice was very well done... In the trailers you hear Paul say the littany of fear but in the movie only Jessica says it. Makes me wonder how much content was cut.",qd6vqv
hhr3ywk,Paul is basically space Jesus . Right,qd6vqv
hhr9kk7,"Good *God Damn* the sense of dread this movie evokes. So many horrific ways to die in the future!

Side note: Thopters..... __T H O P T E R S__ ! ! !",qd6vqv
hhrakky,"As someone who has a little familiarity with Dune (as in I’ve read three chapters of the book before deciding to watch the movie first), did anyone else feel like this maybe should have been 3 films?

Again I don’t know the full scope of the story, but it feels like the whole climax of the film (the attack) would have been a great end point for this film. They had many interesting characters particularly Leto and Jessica, and an intriguing political plot but it all felt a bit rushed. Had they spent more time on those characters, maybe a bit more time on the villains, and crafted a stronger character arc out of Paul using the voice to escape when they were kidnapped, I think this could’ve been a fantastic first “act”. 

The subsequent scenes of them afterward feels like a natural act 2.

As it stands while I was still really enthralled with the film, I felt like we sacrificed a lot of potential particularly with the characters by rushing the pre-attack part to fit in the other stuff at the end. I’m seeing a lot of criticism from audiences not being able engage with the characters and story and I can’t help but feel like these criticisms would’ve been assuaged a bit had they focused more on the pre-attack section of the story, if that makes sense.

That said, I’m very excited for a second part which hopefully gets made.",qd6vqv

There was no mention of anything like this in the book as far as I remember.

Why does he see himself stabbed, or Jamis becoming his friend?

As an adaptation of the book 7/10",qd6vqv
hiz0bgq,"I'm so dissapointed, not like the movie was a complete dissaster  but it was a let down for sure. 

What I didn't like:

There's a particular scene where Paul's father says to Paul:

I've sent ""Duncan Idaho"" to....

Who the fuck talks like that?
Does Paul doesn't know Duncan's last name? When that scene happened I felt that the movie it wasn't going to be great, honestly. Edit: I mean the script sometimes is atrocious.


The generic music, my ears got raped by that horns, really what the fuck happened to the mix?

Duncan Idaho's death

COME THE FUCKIN ON, that's all he got?
Why did paul and her mother didn't get into the fight along with Duncan? Both are great warriors how is showed later in the movie, and even both have ""the voice"", Why Duncan is so stupid to sacrifice himself like that? I know he closed the door, but what the fuck, I didn't bought the way it was filmed.
But to be honest I didn't give any fucks to these characters dying, like Paul's father and Duncan Idaho, so incredibly bland takes for 2 big characters.

I know the book isn't about combat but couldn't they just make the fights a bit more fun? I mean it's a movie I need good fight scenes mostly if they use swords, just saying.

Yeah the scenery, the scale, the photography, everything is top notch, visjally stunning, but that alone doesn't do it for me, sorry.",qd6vqv

5.  The Mitchells vs The Machines",qd6vqv
hhnecgx,"The spice must flow.....

One of the greatest movie of our time. Denise Villeneuve's masterclass. It's one of the toughest book to adapt into live action and the movie truely did justice to the source material. Movie captured the core essense of the novel so well and it looks absolutely amazing.

Only thing missing is the Gurney's baliset.",qd6vqv
hhkliby,I literally finished part 2 of the book hours before I went to watch the movie with my friend who hasn't read the book. I frikkin enjoyed the movie but I feel like my friend who hasn't read the book enjoyed it way more. It's pretty insane how quick the pacing was and how much they condensed the source material once they all landed on Arrakis.,qd6vqv
hhklv4t,"I really think the cinematography was some of the best I’ve seen in a movie in a long time. Even tho the colors were a bit too muted, the lighting (indoors) was incredible and the angles Villeneuve picked are fantastic. On action scenes you can see everything with the wide shots, and he was not afraid to get very close to actor’s faces on emotional moments. Everything was so well shot imo.

Oh, and the effects were really well done and the score was deafening (on IMAX) and really unique. I love how both the overall set and costume design and music incorporate Middle Estern/North African elements.

My standout scene was the kiss though. I think it showcases all the best if acting, cinematography and score, all at once.

Can’t wait for the sequel",qd6vqv
hhkmg5x,"This movie breathes well.  There's just enough moments for everything to sink in.  It is not chock-full of dialogue.  It mimics the book in how you can almost read the thoughts of the characters via moving picture.  In short, it is about as perfect a movie adaptation as I could have hoped for.

I planned to see this movie several times on IMAX, and my plan has not changed since first viewing.  One down, many to go.",qd6vqv
hhkmp7z,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhkq4we,Did they make Lady Jessica cry more than was needed or did she always have tears in 75% of her scenes in the first half of the book? I honestly can’t remember but it did seem like a tad much. I remember her not showing this much emotion ALL the time and her being a stronger figure.,qd6vqv
hhkq68j,I don’t get how I was able to watch this in HD two days before it was even on HBO max. Usually these 123movie websites take it off from those streaming services so I’m confused lol,qd6vqv
hhkqqmo,"Went to the 7:00 Thursday showing in an AMC Dolby Theater. The movie was incredible and I would urge everyone to see it on the biggest and best screen and audio system they can.

I also really enjoyed the vision scene Paul Jason the tent, and his horror at the legions of blood soaked Fremen worshipping him.",qd6vqv
hhkwz5t,"Nicely done. Villenueve's weakness is still there though. Its too quite and fails to set the pace. Should have included more dialog for barron harkonnen. Like people who are not familiar with dune, will have seen barron on screen for like two minutes. Very strong dialog but its just so little. Its not put together well for new viewers. I'm super glad that the movie has these excellent visuals. Level of immersion is very good too. So they did the world building aspect really really well.",qd6vqv
hhkxgnr,"Wondering how he plans to work the Spacing Guild into the next film and how the wormhole things work with no mention of navigators. Also didn’t think the gender/race swap of Liet-Kynes was really necessary, I found that a little distracting.

I loved this movie. I can’t even put my finger on why I enjoyed it so much, I don’t even have any previous knowledge of Dune.

Disappointed we didn't see the scene with the Emperor and the Guild. And seems to me Denis left too much for the second movie. But can't wait to see the sequel, if it gets made.

Rebecca Ferguson was outstanding in this movie. Not only did she look as hot as she ever has, she acted the hell out of a really tough part. Great cast but she stood out to me. Oscar Isaac didn't play the role big enough IMO. Rest of cast was good to great. Stellen was really good as the Baron.",qd6vqv
hhl2fhw,This movie rock,qd6vqv
hhl2hq9,"I loved it all. Give me more daddy Denis. 

Seriously though, the sheer scale of this production and the effort that went into it shows. It’s a shame it had been pushed back for obvious real-world reasons, but I’m glad it got put out at a time when the public may feel more confident in seeing this on the big screen. 

I saw the very first showing that I could tonight on the biggest screen possible and those sandworm scenes were beautiful. Kudos to the sandworm wranglers. Those suckers are probably pretty hard to get to obey orders, let alone not actually eat Timothee Chalamet during their confrontation.",qd6vqv

First, all the visions felt ultimately pointless, you expect some kind of a payoff but there really isn't any, at least in this movie, there are so many of them and they drag for so long that it hurts the pace of the movie. From what I understand it's about half (?) of the first book and it's very evident, there is little to no closure, I told my friend it felt like the longest intro I've ever watched. But probably the biggest issue, I didn't care about anybody, I didn't care who lived or died, the society seems to run on Uber Fascism where neo-feudal houses war on each other and people have next to no personality (except for maybe Duncan Idaho and the ecologist lady) or joy in their life. You don't need to always root for someone or have definite good and evil characters, but you should care and have an emotional connection with the characters. It's not a problem while watching the movie, the plot keeps going and it's expertly made but I did think about once it ended. And if this is going to be a long-running series of movies, there definitely should be something there.",qd6vqv

I can't help but feel bad though for newcomers, nothing will make sense to them.

It very much did feel like a pilot episode though, at least Fellowship of the Ring gives you a epic fight the end with the orks and stuff. This kinda just...ended? Idk it was anticlimactic but regardless I enjoyed my time.

Also fuck that leather gimp spider thing, and the sardukar blood ritual shit. Stuff of nightmares.

There were some Hollywood cliche bits of dialogue and cutesy humor moments I want gone, and I’d rather end it with that last Harkonnen scene of “kill them”. But seriously great movie that just flew by -awesome sound design and soundtrack. 

On a pointless side note- when I was a kid I delivered Frank Herbert’s newspaper though I never met him or the family, and then I saw Kyle MacLachlan as Romeo in Ashland and all the buzz was around his having just been cast in Lynch’s Dune.",qd6vqv

I wished they were made as well as this. It was serious, no nonsense, no cutesey marvel moments every five minutes, it looked like people operating and living in the year 30000 or whatever it is. I love the old Dune, tv shows, and I absolutley love this. I hope it makes enough dough to finish out the story.",qd6vqv
hhlz8vv,"Overall, it was fucking amazing. Definitely go to an IMAX if you can. Visually, it's a masterpiece - the cinematograpghy, VFX, set design, everything. It's simply a spectacle. Even costumes, which I was expecting to dislike based on trailers, but I didn't in the end. The same goes for sound - the sound effects (the voice!) and soundtrack were incredible, definitely some of Zimmer's best work (the choirs and drums especially).

The casting was really great, and I like the way they went with most of the characters. I liked Jessica's bigger role (compared to the book), but it would have been so much better if there had been more of the ""betrayal"" plot. It would have improved Thufir's role, who I think was under-utilized (mentats as a concept were, I think, with Piter included), and I think they could show more of Leto and Jessica's relationship / dynamics. I understand that the movie couldn't have been much longer, but I feel like this was missing from the movie. They could have done more with Mapes and Yueh as well. And Guerney, but I expect more of him in Part 2.

It's a fucking great adaptation, like the book deserves. It perfectly captures the scale and while it leaves out some details from lore, there is more than I could expect from a Dune movie. I'm so happy this ended up this good.",qd6vqv

hhm6y83,I feel like they are doing an excellent job adapting the importance of Jessica’s inner strife and building out the character for Part 2. They of course had to cut pivotal things -> got to be hard to adapt some of those book nuances to screen. Wow just wow all around. So impressed. I read Dune once every few years and this is straight up as good of an adaption as we could have hoped. Love the Maud’Dib nods (cute lil desert mouse) without the name. Gonna be epic when paul adopts that name and we hear it for the first time.,qd6vqv

hhn379p,This is a great adaptation and I really enjoyed it. I’m really impressed with how much got to screen and how well it all worked. But it should have been an hbo series.

This is my third timothee chalamet movie and he still acts the same way. Smolder here and there and whisper-talking like his mom is gonna wake up and beat him. Maybe he is doing some oscar winning shit that i don't see. please enlighten me because people seem to love him. Henry V was certainly not like timothee chalamet in the king. He was a 30 year old battle veteran, not a slender man-boy.",qd6vqv

hhogiqu,Timmy is such a twink,qd6vqv
hhowgx7,"Just finished it and I was blown away by the scenery and music. The story hit all the key points and did the book the justice it deserved. 

The technology was recognizable to those that read the book and the shields, nukes, lasers, space craft, thopters, all worked well without prior knowledge but with the backstory those elements were only cooler. 

The voice was also well done. Some of the bene gesserit prophecy was heavy handed but there really is no way to do it easily on film, I do look forward to the next part as it will certainly take center stage. 

And the harkonnens gave off serious Apocalypse Now Marlon Brando vibes which seemed super appropriate. 

Loved the books, love the movie.",qd6vqv
hhowyhi,"Wow, the Jamis actor is quickly becoming one of the most recognizable new actors. I’m hoping his career takes off. His voice and style of acting are unique to him. He’s amazing in Nicolas Winding Refn’s amazon miniseries Too Old To Die Young (a series so explicit that Amazon literally buried it where you can only find it by searching for it). 

He’d make a great addition to the MCU, he seems tailor made for a prominent role",qd6vqv

hhp3i3p,Rebecca Ferguson really enjoyed watching her. Also great job Timothee Chalamet,qd6vqv
hhp5e06,"So it definitely felt like an extra long pilot episode of a HBO show, lol 

Insanely high production values, and THE SCORE. one of the most unique, engrossing sci-fi soundtracks in recent memory. It was so immersive and haunting. I actually think the movie would have been a snoozer with a more generic score.",qd6vqv

hhp6z3f,"My biggest peeve was the portrayal of Lady Jessica. In the book she is regal and sure. In the movie, a whimpering mess. I had a really hard time with her.",qd6vqv
hhp81w5,"It’s very fascinating how they adapted this movie because so much of the book is internal monologues from just about every character which is essentially impossible to do in a movie but I thought they did about as good as possible. You have to externalize some things in the book that are internal, and you have to tweak the way characters handle things but with it all being in service of delivering the same story I was okay with it. You definitely lose a lot of the nuance but the book is so dense and so rich that it makes sense to strip it down to the barebones and try to communicate the main ideas. You could complain about things that were omitted from the books but that’s a tale as old as Time. I think you do lose something with the destiny aspect of Paul’s journey >!because his travel towards creating the jihad is such a massive part of the book!< and I’m not sure a newcomer would clearly understand that from the movie. Either way, I loved the movie and will definitely be seeing it again. I hope it crushes the box office. We need more sci fi movies for adults.",qd6vqv
hhp8e0j,"Loved the movie, and I will say this is the best adaptation we will likely ever get. But without the inner monologues, the scope of the story really suffers. I can see now why people claim Dune to be unadaptable. Even when everything is done pretty much spot on, something just felt missing. And the amount of exposition needed to not make it feel that way… I applaud Mr. Villanueve for even trying.",qd6vqv

hhphmuj,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE LET THIS MOVIE SUCCEEDED. PLEASE.,qd6vqv
hhphqh0,"As someone who read the book fairly recently, I thought this was great and adapted the first part of the book really well, especially since it’d been thought to be almost impossible to adapt to film. Every actor was cast perfectly for their role, and I found it all really immersive. I don’t even want to know how they created the sets, because Arrakis felt like an actual place that people lived in. 

However, judging it on its own, I’m stumped as to how this will be for non-book readers. I feel like the visuals and world building will definitely help engage viewers, but the plot is a bit dense and despite the runtime, there were still many aspects of it that felt like it would have come across a bit rushed, had I not known about it beforehand. Like how did Yueh’s betrayal come off for non-book readers for example? Without the book, it would’ve felt anti-climactic and somewhat brushed aside that this relatively minor-seeming character was a major contributing downfall leading to the Duke’s death.",qd6vqv
hhphru4,"I have no experience reading the book(s) and was very worried the lore would be too dense to follow properly. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a struggle to do so, though there are certain aspects that I feel could have been better explained or made sense, though I'm sure they could be better explained in the sequels or if I end up reading the source material. The production design, costumes, visual effects, cinematography are all absolutely stunning. I really felt drawn into the world and watching in IMAX was def the best experience for anyone seeing this in theaters. The cast was wonderful and I thought the pacing was actually well done. It does admittedly take a little while to get going but I felt intrigued all throughout the film and once we get to Arrakis everything really only gets better. I really hope pt2 gets greenlit very soon but I can certainly see this being a huge sci-fi property with lore that is as deep as something like Star Wars and I'm all for it.",qd6vqv
hhpjura,"This movie looks stunning, the casting is great, and I thought they adapted the book really well. The Harkonnens ended up a bit differently than I imagined but I didn’t mind it, their creepiness worked well.",qd6vqv
hhpkftg,"I was thrilled when Denis was announced as the director.  Enemy was one of my favorite films of the teens and I've truly enjoyed all of his films since.  I like that he can deliver both mindbending thrillers and visually incredible sci fi equally... very talented guy.

So I read half of Dune (Book 1) about 25 years ago and there was a lot coming back from memory, it seemed pretty faithful.  

This film is an audiovisual masterpiece.  The cinematography, costume design, set design, sound and effects were phenomenal.  And that was my favorite part of BR2049.  I can't say I went into it looking forward to 53% of the runtime is directly looking at Timothy Chamomile's face, this series (I'm a believer... he'll get the greenlight) will probably be his ""The Departed / Fight Club"" moment, wherein he transcends from darling heartthrob to a highly respected actor.  Rebecca Ferguson delivered the best performance, to me.  The casting for the others was fantastic too.

My only regret... was not seeing this in an IMAX.  

And since this is /r/movies, I have to recommend [Jodorowsky's Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/), it's a fascinating look at an equally ambitious thrust at the source material, not so different than what Denis did (who pilots a $165m film series!?).",qd6vqv
hhpli9i,"There was so much build up and exposition in this film that I’m dying to see a part 2. I honestly feel like this could be a series.

I wasn't sure if I had missed something or what.  It felt like there were diplomatic machinations going on that were important, but it seemed like a very roundabout way of doing nothing.  Like why not just not appoint Oscar Isaac in the first place and let Marlon Brando run the planet like he was doing?",qd6vqv
hhwlm42,"Much, much better on second viewing, this time in IMAX! My ears were ringing afterward! That last scene was so loud it gave me tinnitus!

hhyb9gz,"Mixed feelings on this.  I thought it was good overall.  Aesthetically (the cinematography, set design, costume design, CGI, hair and makeup, etc) was amazing.  But the writing felt off.  

A bit too exposition heavy before they arrive on Dune world (not gonna try to spell that).  And the pacing was reeeeally slow.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but maybe they let lots of moments just be, instead of using that time for character and political intrigue.  I haven't read the book, but I feel like a LOT of political intrigue got left out.  I feel like they should've ramped up the pace a bit in what they had in order to make room for some of the political intrigue they left out.  Feel like I would've liked it more if they did.

Edit:  And another thing, we spent WAY too much time in his visions of the girl.  There was a lot of time that should've been used to further character development and the political intrigue between houses.",qd6vqv

hhyjahy,"Wasn't a huge fan of how many times they cut back to slow-mo Chani, and her ""this is only the beginning"" line at the end felt extremely ham-fisted, but otherwise, I loved pretty much everything about this movie.

The world building is awesome. Lady Jessica is great. The soundtrack/audio is amazing (the voice, Harkonnen's weird little silence umbrella, etc etc). I saw it in a ""regular"" theatre, but I may have to talk some friends into joining me for an IMAX viewing...",qd6vqv
hhyofze,"There were a lot of scenes cut out from the movie. Denis Villeneuve did a great job of capturing the essence of the story and visualized it in a spectacular manner. That ending combat was rushed outside instead of inside a sietch cavern. The Voice of Paul was so weird that they incorporated an old woman's. If this film won't have a sequel, it will be one of the greatest disppointments of film history.",qd6vqv
hhytun6,"Amazing movie. The narrative is super subtle in its approach and never gets to the point of complete bordem.

I don't want to compare it to the 1984 film at all, as I'd rather view it as an entirely different take/screenplay on the original book, HoWeVeR! I think I just miss how uncomfortable David Lynch can make you feel, and this film didn't trigger that emotion in me. I don't think it intended to, which is just fine. I think it's just because I saw the 1984 film before I read the book, that I always associate DUNE with a feeling of discomfort.",qd6vqv

hifwvdu,"I think it's incredibly important to watch this in a theater or a good home cinema. Three reasons:

1) They use some wonky sounds throughout. The voice, the harkonnen guttural sounds, the desert sand and worms, and just the soundtrack. A lot of very unique sounds that work better with a good sound setup that hits your entire body and not just your ears like headphones would. 

2) Villeneuve being who he is, he likes his big vistas and long establishing shots. They're gorgeous on the big screen.

3) Something about attention and distractions. Now that it's out on HBO Max, I've watched it at home, and it's honestly difficult hard to stay concentrated. It's a long, serious movie, with no jokes except for ""grown some muscle?"" In the theater you just have fewer distractions, it's easier to stay focused. At least for me.

One question though. Is incest hinted anywhere in the movie. I am a bit confused with some scenes:

* After the box scene Jessica tells Paul. ""Bloodlines are crossed in the shadows for the one""
* In one scene Paul tells Jessica ""You are pregnant"". The next scene she cries inconsolably in the hall before talking to Leto. May be I am missing subtext/context of someone who read the book.
* Tent scene is a bit weird.
* The fact that movie been made by a FRENCHCanadian does nt help my thinking either :)

hiumu9v,With HBO Max you can freeze shots to see things in detail so ....all due respect I am glad they never showed were the every day people lived cause if the Duke had his son in a dark gloomy bedroom that looked like a prison cave on castle Caladan ...I would hate to see what their homes looked like. Damn if your teen son had to wake up in such a grim place he would act depressed too even without visions or impending destiny. Even on Arrakis that place looked gloomy and dark as hell.

Well, I finally caved in tonight and decided to watch the movie at home. I had no idea what it still was as I hit play.

My first thought.. was 10 mins into movie where I said ""fuck.. I should be seeing this in IMAX!!""

HUGE mistake I made watching this at home and I'm mad at myself!! This movie was on a level of epic proportions that only deserves to he watching on THE BIG SCREEN! Why didn't anyone tell me?? What a great a movie this was! I can't wait for Part 2 and 3!

It does not justice watching at home!""

IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, GO WATCH IT ON IMAX ASAP!!

Dune is an absolute movie in every sense! I'm excited for what follows.

Minor gripes: dialogue audio was iffy at points, definitely need to watch at home with subtitles, and Timothée felt a bit too soft spoken in certain scenes.

Major gripes: so much dialogue was cut and there was a loss of Paul’s inner dialogue which weakened his character a good deal.

Now for my review and holy shit Rebecca Ferguson just blew me away and I think really carried this movie along with everyone else but she was a level above in my opinion and without her it wouldn’t be the same. 

I saw the original Dune by Lynch on dvd so I kinda knew what was happening but I didn’t read the book on purpose going into this movie. It was so amazing from the entire cast to the visuals. Everything really felt absolutely massive and the planets were super unique.

Star Wars has shown desert planets before but nothing like Arakis where I freakin thirsty watching it. Also the battles and the way the armor works where it can be super helpful against projectiles which is why sword to sword combat is needed. Just awesome stuff. 

Finally I feared this movie would get John Carpentered because Dune has been copied by so many series that people wouldn’t realize it’s the OG Star Wars, but Denis did a great job of balancing everything and giving us the absolute best of Game of Thrones intrigue and awesome action.

hisi9x5,"Is it bad to say I saw it at home and was thrilled by the attack sequence but switched off 15 minutes before the end because of the knife fight? I mean what kind of ending to a movie is that? 

Why not restructure the battle sequence to the final quarter of the movie like Star Wars leaving the audience on a high and wanting more?

And where was the blood, broken bones and general weirdness like the Lynch version? The PG-13 spoiled everything, the Baron in the 80s version was truly gross with sores and pustules and the 2021 version looked like he could be on a ""TLC"" channel special and nobody was there to wildly overact like Sting.

hj49jv4,"Denis Villeneuve finally broke Dune, but that still doesn't stop it from being a largely boring film. I wanted to prime on my Dune knowledge since I know it's an information superdump, so I tried watching a fan edit of Lynch's movie last night (The Alternative Edition Redux) and fell into a deep slumber halfway into it. Villeneuve's version is definitely an improvement in storytelling and technical achievement, but without the context of the 1984 film (thank you, Wikipedia), I would have been even more lost. And it's only *half* the book. It really feels like nothing much happens other than a 2.5 hour setup for part 2. And even that's a letdown.

However, my theater experience was memorable for more undesirable reasons. An older man came in late and sat in the empty row behind me, a couple seats over to my right. During The Batman trailer that preceded the film, I began to notice the smell of a strange odor. I looked to my right and he had his disgusting feet pressed up against the back of the seat almost at face level. I had to spend the duration of the movie leaning towards my left just to spare myself the nausea (the theater's ventilation/COVID filtration system barely kicked in). But it turns out that wasn't even the worst of it. About two hours in, I heard the unmistakable sound of someone pissing. Then the strong stench of ammonia hit me. I glared back to my right and saw him leaning forward, pressed up against the back of the seat. 10-15 minutes passed. Then I smelled *shit*. He got up and left soon thereafter, and never came back. I had to cover my nose and mouth just to make it through the rest of the movie (I really needed one of those stillsuits from Dune). Just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, I looked in the row behind me after the movie had ended and the lights were back up. Sure enough, I saw a puddle of liquid on the floor, as well as wet footprints leading out the theater. Not to mention the floor is slanted, so all of that came down my way as well. I've never been so fucking disgusted in my life. I can't tell you how much I fucking hate people. This is what ultimately ruined Dune for me, and I don't think I'll ever be able to purge my memory of it.",qd6vqv
hhktef1,"This movie felt like the closest anyone has come, or perhaps will come, to recreating the epic adaptation that was the Lord of the Rings. Part 2 will tell whether or not this one cements itself in history as the sci-fi cornerstone counterpart to Peter Jackson's fantasy trilogy.",qd6vqv

hhkpx7b,"This was one of the most incredible movie going experiences I think I’ve ever had. I thought the casting was perfect for every single character. The sound design in imax was blowing my ears off in the best way. The background chants, languages, random weirdness were so spot on down to the Sardaukar General commanding the legions. 

There wasn’t a single substantial scene deviation I noticed from the book which I’m pretty amazed by considering the train wreck that was the original. I think the end came at the perfect time. My only complaint is the hoky-ness of the repeated “desert power” phrase. But I’ll take it if I must. Not to even mention the awful talking to myself voiceovers that we’re thankfully omitted in this version. 

I cannot fathom how Denis was not permitted to film the sequel at the same time. A massive bummer that We’ll have to wait at least two years for what may be the most anticipated sequel in a long time.",qd6vqv
hhwntkk,I wonder if those pissed off at the cliffhanger ending felt the same when Fellowship came out two decades ago.,qd6vqv

The acting was incredible. I've not seen much of Timothy Chalamet but Call Me By Your Name was enough for me to look forward to how much incredible work we'll get to see from him. He is so talented, and I love what he brought to the first installment of this franchise.

I particularly love the mechanics of The Voice and really hope we get a lot more of the hostage scene dynamic. That made for such great film and I want to see more applications of that. I loved both the choreographing and the character development in the fight scene with Jamil. I think those two elements make the top of my list.

And of course Hans Zimmer can't miss, so.

I recently bought the book and was waiting for this movie before reading so I could go in completely blind but I don't know if I'll be able to wait for the next one. 

And tangentially related this was our first time doing a streaming premiere from home of a movie we wanted to see on release and I'm a convert.",qd6vqv
hhsro5p,"Seriously, can Timothee talk with chest? Why does he talk low? Is it his way of trying to look sexy while on screen? Ohh and this movie sucks.

Most overrated Dennis Villneuve film, and his worst film by far. Lol, am I supposed to be excited for a second part? All those people saying you won’t like it if you like marvel movies, or the morons that say “you didn’t get it”, or the people that say this movie was just for world building are coping.",qd6vqv
hi17gic,"Dune seems like the type of movie that hyped people simply from other people’s hype, and the cycle of fake hype spiralled out of control and now it has unrealistically high expectations. Similar to Pacific Rim 2. Just because niche cinephiles on social media wanted it, doesn’t mean that general moviegoers did. PR2 flopped, and so will Dune. It has grossed $40M opening weekend. VERY weak! HALLOWEEN KILLS, an R rated movie with bad word of mouth, outgrossed it. 

I’m not sure where this bandwagon interest came from. I mean, the original source material is not very well known, and before you attack me and say I’m wrong - a niche fandom does not a box office hit make. It’s very fitting that Zendaya stars. Another household name that became a household name for simply BEING a household name. Not very talented; just another Instagram influencer. In fact, Kim Kardashian could fit in this box too. Dune, Zendaya and Kim Kardashian - all lacking in every aspect, but still getting plastered everywhere because social media idolizes beauty and popular trends.

hhkzb2l,"I adored it. Honestly a tiny bit baffled at the lukewarm reception or some of the critiscisims. Ive read Dune and Dune Messiah but *ages* ago. Even going in without many memories of the book besides it's central themes I throughly enjoyed it, didnt find it heartless, did care for the characters (not a lot of time with them, I can get that, but I think the superb performances made up for it, I think you get the characters' motivations and struggles). If you go in knowing its the first part of a story I really do think it succeeds in every way it tries as a first movie. It was beautiful to look at, it sounded amazing, I got the stakes very clearly and it absolutely works as a story and a film.",qd6vqv
hhwxyzn,"**Can all fans commit to watching Dune (2021) in theatres at least twice?**

Not only do we need to ensure the movie makes enough $$$ to **guarantee the sequel is produced**, we also need to send a message to the industry that **making great adaptations pays**.

In my opinion this was a great movie, but much more importantly, this was a movie adaptation that was *trying to be a great movie* – and that's pretty rare.

What I mean is that they didn't disrespect the source material, Hollywood-ise it, dumb it down, abbreviate it and churn it out – like so many adaptations that have woefully butchered the books they're based on. No; they hired a great director, put time and attention into bringing the book's details to life, filmed it with incredible IMAX cameras, and marketed it as a serious film.

And if you like that, and want to see more of it... then don't watch this on HBO Max. Don't pirate it. Don't wait for the Blu-Ray or for it to come on your TV or computer screen. Don't even just go see it in the cinema. Go see it in IMAX if you can, and, if you can, see it *twice*!",qd6vqv

Feels like it should have been a 10-episode 1-hour-each serialization.

One thing I don't understand is the reason why they casted so many big names. Of course they are all great actors, and it shows.

 I would have done the voice of that hand in the box lady at the beginning, commanding Paul to take the planet, and given him a test to establish himself early on in the movie. something more ominous and dark than the treaty signing.

They’re strange, emotionally detached characters that don’t appear to have any personality other than their predetermined “goals” as laid out by the narrative.

I understand they wouldn't want to make Paul seem too inhuman as the hero, but his mentat capabilties (human computing) coupled with spice and Bene Gesserit training were what allowed him to see all the futures.

I've seen reviews complain about the pace dipping in the 2nd half but I thought it helped it. The first half felt very rushed to squeeze it all in and maybe keep viewers interested that haven't read the book. It was to it's detriment though imo. 

Also the words ""desert power"" didn't come across in my head as goofy in the novel as it did over the course of the movie.",qd6vqv

Was it always the Emperor's plan for them to come back and retake the planet from House Atreides? If so, were they in on that plan or did the Emperor just count on them coming back? It seems like Dave Bautista was not in on it, but the Baron was a bit harder to read in this regard.",qd6vqv

After a bit of thought, I think that all the Caladan scenes should have been cut right down (after all, nearly everything happens on Arrakis itself). This would probably have allowed more time in the section leading up to the attack, which did feel quite perfunctory. Eg, you could have had things for the book that got left out, like the dinner party, which w give some additional characterisation to Jessica and Kynes; more discussion between Paul and Kynes at the monitoring station after the attack; the general suspicion caused by the revelation of a high ranking traitor among the Atreides; the Duke knowing that he’s walking into a trap (but underestimating the extent the Baron and Emperor will go to); and some additional development of the supporting characters and Duniverse.

Geidia prime is supposed to be a ecological disaster with implications of harkonan abuse there and arrakis.  Weren't the sardukar supposed to come from a nuclear wasteland?  The freman are kinda vaguely given ecoterrorists vibes, which is good.   I hope they play that up in the next one. I expect thats where they show off kines master plan.

I think they underplayed how big of a game changer shields are.   No mention of lasguns.  Semi-disappointed the swordplay choreography wasn't up to a good showcase for slow blades.   Ya, I get it, it's less flashy and big fast flashy swings. ...but that's not dune.

No shields in the desert? Do I not remember that right?    Carpet bomb them.    The whole reason that troops carry swords and knives is because a trooper doesn't have to worry about getting shot when he's sheilded.  

And no mention of family atomics?",qd6vqv

higiwlp,"Definitely a stupid question, and perhaps I wasn't paying attention. (I do need to read the books admittedly,but if you answer,I don't mind being spoilt)

So my grasp of it was that the Emperor believed House Atreides were potentially unloyal to him.

He pretended to give them control of Arrakis so that the House Harkonnen would be easily able to slaughter them, having intimate knowledge of the planet, rather than invade Caladan where the Atreides might have the home advantage.

HOWEVER (and again, I might have completely the wrong idea)

There's a fairly known prophecy, told by the Bene Gesserit (who sits at the right hand of the Emperor) that one day a hero would arise from Arrakis and lead the houses against The Emperor.

So why would he risk sending he's already confident is against him, to a planet that will spark his doom?",qd6vqv

Absolutely visually stunning film. To me, the little things that are just plain awesome are the little spectra effects of the shields and the death blows and explosions. Just pure awesome. Those little touches are spot on. 

Of what little I know of the films, that whole gom jabbar test, though updated visually ... the finger-prick glove/contraption from the older film seemed a lot more realistic. Holding a literal 'needle' *near* Paul's neck just didn't have the same effect. It just didn't seem as realistic. As someone who can read up on lore and various concepts, anyone who didn't know the abilities of said Reverend Mothers ... it would just seem like some weird test that was poorly planned.

Given my limited actual experience with the books/other media, I'm a little confused to why there was no featuring of other Houses like House Ordos -- or was that more of part of the video games?

I'm also a little confused by Baron Harkonnen and his ... uh, levitating floating growing tall ability thing. That is just ''there''. There's no context to that.",qd6vqv

It's the casting that hinders it slightly I think. Jason Momoa should be nowhere near this project. Rebecca Ferguson is a disappointing Jessica and as much as I like Skarsgard he doesn't quite manage to embody the Baron.

I did love all the dream sequences. When Zendaya showed up, and you realise the crew had other people from his dreams, I was seriously hyped to see where it was all going to go. The way they built up the story was very effective. The movie ended with me wishing there was more. 

It reminded me a lot of Zack Snyder's Justice League, and in particular what it would feel like to stop halfway through haha. ZSJL is a pretty slow movie, but once it gets to the sewer fight scene you're completely invested, and the whole second half is really damn good.

hopee06,"Cinematography could have been more epic and innovative; i like the character-focused shots, but the expanse landscape shots are things we've seen before. Sound was epic and carried the film IMO. Editing was pretty good too.

The movie didn't however achieve a depth anywhere close to the novel. I suppose that could be attributed to the medium, but I'd rather say it was the writing. Dialogue could have been heavier.

Enjoyed the first half way more. Glad Denis concentrated heavily on the Bene Gesserit in the first half and gave Jessica ample screen time. But Pauls inner civil war and awakening, realisation of his destiny, the prophecy, wasn't executed well in the second half. The maturity felt contrived. I really liked Jessica's performance. 

I think Jodorwosky would say you need 'balls' to make this film, to push the mind to it's outer limits, to think of imagery to reflect the sentiment of the novel - something otherwordly. I don't think Dune can be adapted to the big screen, at least through the great artistic reducer of Hollywood. it was a nobel effort though.

Also, one of the greatest fight scenes I've experienced regardless of medium was Paul vs Jamis. It was so underwhelming, lacklustre in the movie, i was shocked. Incredibly rushed and banal sequences. it really left a poor taste in my mouth to end it.

The quick world building was done pretty well IMO. 

Also, not a big fan of split movies.

I sorta sympathise with Denis that this film had to cater to two audiences: those who've read Dune, and those who hadn't. So the film had to be palpable and coherent, not too experimental.",qd6vqv

He's the most interesting character in the first book and is a great foil to the main Atreides characters - we basically get none of the sense of his power and shrewdness in the movie, where the gender-swapped Kynes is just the basic action movie helper trope.

I can see why the original character was scrapped or hamstrung due to the direction they chose to take the movie, without the traitor subplot and the dinner party, but still; you just really miss his character in the first half of the movie.",qd6vqv

Also I did find it quite a challenge keeping up with all the names and civilisations and who exactly was who at times lol but I guess that’s partly due to the dialogue being difficult to hear on my end.

hhp8s7f,"It was, like the movie from the 1980's, still not the book. They just can't follow the story for some reason.

* Important poetic phrases were dropped in favor of casual sounding Americanisms. 
* Characters didn't do things they did in the book
* The Baron, apparently in a tribute to the Lynch film, was a gross and disgusting floating fatman and his planet is a dark, gross, oily machine world. It was not that in the book.
* Irulan was left out entirely as was the Emperor, and someone can't pronounce PAHdi'shah and instead said pahDEEsha. The entire story is told by Irulan
* Most egregious: The Duke's rescue of the men in the harvester fails to impress Kynes, yet in the Lynch movie and the book, this is a critical moment for the Duke in that he values and cares for his people above all things. In this movie, they turned it into a moment for Paul to have a vision
* The Box scene dialogue was poorly written
* The music was vastly inferior to the Toto/Eno soundtrack from Lynch's film. They should have recycled the music or at least re-recorded it and kept a lot of it.
* There were moments where the reverend mother was speaking in his visions and she sounded like a Halloween witch. It was confusing.
* His visions were nothing like the book.
* How can you have Dune without the Baron yelling ""The Duke will die before these eyes! And he'll know, HE WILL KNOW, that it is I, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who encompasses his doom! HAHAHAHAHAHA!""

I loved how they portrayed ""the voice."" The scene with Paul and Jessica using it in the ornithopter was genuinely scary, and also when Paul snapped at his mom. The Harkkonen invasion scene was nuts.

Chalamet did better than expected. His freak out scene over the ""holy war"" could have gone better. Him kicking his legs up and panicking wasn't great, but this leads me to my only real criticism...

**Zendaya**.

WHO the fuck decided to cast this bitch? She **cannot act**. Literally cannot act. Not to mention the fact that her dialogue was cringe as fuck and came off as something Joss Whedon would put in a re-shoot of a Marvel movie. The whole ""you look like a boy"" shit and how she's immediately belittling him was just bad. And don't try to explain her character to me or rationalize it to me. I've read the book three times and I understand what the point of the scene was. It just didn't work. She didn't work. Her, ""And this is only the beginning,"" was fucking cringe too and was obviously just a stupid line thrown in there to end the movie. 

Are there really no other girls in their early 20s to cast? Does she really have some kind of following to bring girls to this movie? Girls already aren't gonna go to this unless they are dragged by their BFs. And it's not like she's some piece of eye-candy either. As soon as she started talking, it was the first time I felt myself pulled out of the movie and instantly rolled my eyes. I have to feel like the studios crammed her down Denis' throat. And I just cannot see her having any chemistry with Chalamet in Part 2 either. Also not a fan of the gal playing Liet Kynes.

Why wouldn’t everyone have their shields turned on 24/7?

Why do people never do the sand walk to avoid the worms? Seems like everyone just runs in the sand Willy nilly. Even when Paul and his mom do the sand walk a worm still comes.

It's not insightful or secretive to use weird, cryptic phrases in every line of dialogue, its just pretentious.

The exposition was also one of the worst i've seen for a movie of this caliber. First 5 minutes is just them literallly explaining whats happening. ""These are the people.

Additionally, the casting felt forced. In my opinion could have been plenty of no name actors that did a better job because the casting in this case was done to carry the movie and it did not. 

The acting by Brolin, Mamoa and Bardem was terrible at best, Isaac, Ferguson and chalamet were ok. Skarsgard was the only good actor. No comment on Bautista as he was on screen for a total of four cutscenes worth 32 seconds of a nearly three hour movie!",qd6vqv

I am sure in the books that the names are native to where they came from, but from an outsider... the names just don't fit everything else that is happening.

Other issue was that there was overly dramatic music playing in the background for 95% of the movie.  My wife thought we forgot to turn something off in the basement haha.

If you feel comfortable, see this on the biggest screen possible. 

Never read the books. My only knowledge going into this was something something sand worms and spice… and man did I get hooked into this world. Just massive scale! I want to go read the books now. 

I love how much time in this movie is spent on slow motion spaceships landing while Hans Zimmer’s score just soars through my body.

Set pieces just begging you to notice how fucking massively everything is done in this universe.  Then you get to the scenes where you need to have dialog and the universe is about a dozen people and Arrakeen is the size of a suburb with no other cities in evidence on Arrakis. 

I do feel bad for Denis though, he was very passionate about this getting theatrical release first as I understand it.  Watching this on my cheap TV because it's on HBO Max wasn't doing the film any favors.   At least my sound system never got in the way of the dialog.

I enjoyed how each of the characters was portrayed, although Jessica seems rather damsel-y.  My biggest gripe is Momoa, who once again gets paid to be a hunky badass and doesn't bring any real flair or life to the character.  Those who read the books...is this just the part he was born to play, or should there have been a bit more character to the character?",qd6vqv

I was honestly wondering how they would fit so much in, I think not focusing on the “traitor” plot line so much was a great choice. Obviously it was there, but in the books it’s this overarching thread where everyone is accusing each other and for the film it really wasn’t necessary.

I thought the casting was excellent and lived up to the hype. Oscar as Leto and Brolin as Gurney were the 2 that really stood out to me. Oscar as Leto…it’s like the role was made for him. Captivated me every time he was on screen. 

I saw it with someone who had not read the books, and he enjoyed it, but was a little confused because he couldn’t hear the actors at certain times, especially Jessica. I noticed this too. Not sure if it was just my theatre or the sound mixing in the movie, but the dialogue at times sounded low. Not ideal for a movie with a bunch of weird sci-fi phrased like “Bene Gesserit” and “Mahid”. I think it could be confusing because with low audio people might think “wait was that a made up word/phrase for the film, or did they say something else I was supposed to understand but couldn’t hear?”

however

>!it's like the entire film, the visuals, the sound, the characters are all one big aesthetic thing behind a glass plate, it's an aesthetic scene that plays out before you, a scene that is admittedly beautiful but is hard to really engage with. it suffers a bit from Tenettus - booming soundtracks muffling speech. and the second half of the film doesnt have much by way of vast epic space stuff, it's all done on a smaller scale, due to the story itself, so the film ends up climaxing about half way through and then pulling you slowly to an underwhelming end. it's very definitively the first half of a story. it doesnt function at all as a standalone piece, it NEEDS dune 2 which isnt confirmed.!<

>!and secondly the story itself is a little problematic. theyve been trying to make a film of Dune for so long that perhaps they didnt realise that in the current social climate, there are definitely things that people COULD pick on in this movie. it's pretty much textbook ""white saviour"" and the use of Islamic terminology throughout has the potential to offend people.

Clearly, I'm in the minority, but it just felt very bland to me. Mostly just an incohesive collection of broad, roaring chords and various eerie instruments -- almost like the background music you'd hear in a trailer. Very little that was memorable at all imo.

The bagpipe queue was actually one of the only things that stood out to me, but not in a good way. It just felt so out of character with the rest of the music throughout the rest of the battle sequence

hieisd8,"I was disappointed that when the maid flashed the Chryss knife that she didn't wet it with her life blood like she did in the book. 

Would've really hammered home how fuckin intense the Fremmen are for people who haven't read it.

That scene in the book is just so tense and fantastic, and the wetting of the blade just is the icing on top.",qd6vqv
hi0k4sq,"I think showing the bead of water falling onto Paul's lip and the nose-blood that was wasted did the trick, but I guess I also was looking for it.",qd6vqv
hi1zyht,"FWIW, I have not read the books and I understand that water is a crucial part of life there. I think I understand that a body should not go to waste due to the water it contains. I'm not sure how the books discuss it, but from other comments here, maybe the books talk about water too much and they decided to time it down for the movie. Loved the movie. Can't wait for part 2.",qd6vqv
hi4h0nr,"> Anyone else feel like the importance of water was a miss?

The one scene I was hoping to see was the one contrasting how the nobles were splashing water when washing their hands, and the wet towels were then sold to the commoners waiting outside the palace. A three-minute scene at most.",qd6vqv
hiaog0g,I was bummed they left out the hidden little garden with the hidden note from the previous bene Gesserit?? Like not only how it mentioned how expensive water wise it was but I feel like they missed some huge plot lines :/,qd6vqv
hi681xo,"My 2 complaints were that (1) the water never seemed like an issue when it should have been beaten over the head of the viewer that these people come from rich planets full of water just to move to a planet absolutely devoid of it and (2) that the worms never really felt terrifying. I just wanted an ""OH SHIT"" moment and once it was revealed in full, we'd already seen 2 long distance shots which sucked a lot of terror out of it. I dunno, I just needed something to scale it when it appeared so I could feel some tension.

Other than that, the film filled all the hype I had going into it.",qd6vqv
hi7roax,Didn’t read the books but watched the movie and I could tell there was so many water metaphors but couldn’t quite put my finger on the significance- I suppose the obvious water = life.  But I even loved how they made the sand look and act like water.  The scene where the worm turns away from them the sand looks and acts like a wave breaking against the rock.  So I could tell the movie was trying to say something about the sand and water being related but hopefully the sequel will shed more light,qd6vqv

hi63ggy,"To be fair, they haven't spent that much time with the Fremen yet, and aside from Stilgar spitting and them telling Paul they'll reclaim Jamis' water, there hasn't been much opportunity for the Atreides to learn the almost deified importance of Water on Arrakis. 

I do think the point was made clearer when Jessica was training Paul to use The Voice, turning something as essential and important as Water into an exercise, as well as Paul feeling the waters of Caladan for the last time. Also, the fun little jab at Lynch's Dune, ""The Water cannot hear you, command me.""",qd6vqv
hi7mvbz,"It's a desert planet, of course water is important. The movie did a great job of trusting the viewer to understand, in my opinion. It did a lot more showing than telling, which is to its credit. You still have Stillgar saying that the water in Jessica's body is more valuable to him than all the resources of House Atreides.",qd6vqv
hi8463n,"Paul cries during Jamis's funeral, not when he kills him.

When Paul kills Jamis, he's feeling exhilarated, which is why Jessica must perform a teaching trauma, by asking ""so how does it feel to be a murderer?"", so that Paul doesn't grow to enjoy killing people.

The beginning of the next movie will certainly involve Jamis's funeral, and thay will do the whole ""he gives water to the dead"" shtick.",qd6vqv
higu25j,"and the scene where Paul pledges his life to the Freman when he meets Kynes at the ecological station.  That should have been in the movie, otherwise, there is no real reason for Stilgar to keep Jessica and Paul alive.  The Freman were directed to look out for the two, after Kynes leaves the station. 

But hey, it's a movie....",qd6vqv
hjlf9cx,I really liked how they used Jessica saying the fear mantra as a replacement for Paul's inner monologue.,qd6vqv

Kynes is standing on the sand, the hooks are out and I am leaning next to my daughter.

I was gonna whisper, 'You aint seen nothing yet!'.

Then.....

~sigh~

This really was the Dune movie I have always wanted, but the ball was dropped in a couple of ways.  The importance of water is one.

The way this movie handled it someone unfamiliar with the text probably thought, 'Oh I get it - water is important!'.

No, no, no.no...no.  You don't get it.  That is about 10 degrees below where you need to be.  I mean, the Fremen kill non-fremen on site (in the open desert), distill all the water from there corpses AND IT IS CLEARLY IN THE FREMEN'S BEST INTEREST TO DO SO.

They talked about taking someone's water twice, but I don't think they ever defined it.

And the Shadout Mapes!  My girl was done WRONG!

I have always loved her in the book.  Sort of this Bobba Fett sort of character.  She has always felt underutilized to me.  Someone that just screamed, 'I have seen shit, I have done shit, I am capable...' but was never really tested.

Having said that, I did like her casting.  I liked all the casting.",qd6vqv
hi03zje,"I was a bit disappointed at the lack of water saving emphasis as well. So many times I was like, nope, the fremen should literally be keeping their mouths shut unless they are talking, which is something the book mentions a few times (the importance of water to the point that breathing with an open mouth wasted too much moisture).

I think a line or three showing just how disciplined they are about not wasting the body's water.",qd6vqv

Considering Apocalypse Now was inspired in part by Heart of Darkness, and the Dune movie focused heavily on the ""Colonial Rule"" aspect of the books (one of the strongest points of the original Dune book), I thought that was a clever thing. There is no way it was not intentional.

I felt the movie did the first parts of the book justice. Just good stuff. Was totally surprised by how good it was after initially being reluctant to watch it.

Edit: More: I appreciated deeply that the Baron was represented as an intelligent and smooth thinker rather than as a buffoon. In the books (especially the 2nd and 3rd books) his character is elaborated upon and you discover that he was a very clever villain. His son Rabban, on the other hand, was an outrageous brute (depicted rather well in the movie). I am curious to see how they depict Feyd (and the Emperor for that matter). How they depicted the Baron was actually one of the best surprises of the movie.",qd6vqv

hi9ysz6,"Read the book. It's way better. Or watch the Lynch's version which so far to me seems still the best one since Jodorowky's didn't get made. If you want more detail and length in the movie then watch the 4.5h + 4.5h 2000 version/miniseries but they messed some things up to me when it comes to relationships of main characters.

This 2021 version... so far it's a mixed bag to me, big name actors and director, big bucks, modern CGI, but the whole thing seems watered down, stripped hard yet it's a 2 parter while Lynch fit it whole into 1 movie while stripping I would dare to say lower or same amount. Sure I would have loved a 4h Lynch version but reading the book before the story had most of it in the movie just didn't include all the fine detail that's in the book and one of big reasons some people don't read the book, a lot of detail and text to read so they get bored and give up.

The book is very detailed but the 2021 version to me doesn't seem detailed at all for a 2 part movie. It's a decent watch once and forget which is a shame because Arrival and BR2049 are way above.

I definitely don't agree with the Villeneuve and Nolan promoting each other's I would say mediocre movies, Tenet and Dune when they have so much better movies under their belts. It's just marketing.

Dune probably suffers from being over done at this point. Who wanted it, read it or seen it decades ago. Also probably overhype by all the big names present in it.",qd6vqv

Too much time is spent for exposition and too little for world building and character interaction, which are essential parts of the books. It results in a movie that is certainly easy to digest for newcomers, but just devoid of any substance for anyone who already knew Dune and expected more than pretty images to illustrate what was already in the mind.

I'm pretty upset by this adaptation to be honest. It just feels extremelly lazy.",qd6vqv

hiuluxe,As an African American I didn't like that stuff. Wasn't in the book. And if the herald looks like a South African Cardinal ..will Denis have the Emperor dressed like the Pope?. The inside myth that some have about the hidden enmity between African American Americans and Africans was exploited by having the Duke ask Thufir....How much did that N words bling cost and Thufir rolls his eyes and says how much. I mean damn. Herbert would have never wrote any shyt like that.,qd6vqv
hhujgiu,"Only thing that took me out was when Dr. Yueh spoke with Paul privatly, as I first thought it was to keep Jessica from overhearing, but I was thinking she too would understand the language, but left it as ""well, if he speak a different language plus whispering, Jessica maybe wouldnt hear it cleanly"", but thinking back it seemed to me like it was to convey a ""heart to heart"" and Yueh switched to his native tongue and had a real, honest moment with Paul. In retrospective, he was betraying House Atreides but in that moment he was honestly concerned for Paul and it made him switch.

The way the movie use language to convey characters and feelings are excellent looking back. I dont know if that is in the book, as I have only learned and know all the story from second hand, but it's a nice touch for the world in the film as you said.",qd6vqv

hhnm1xc,"Totally agree, and my first thought leaving was ""there should have been another one or two scenes of Paul and his father together."" Those moments were great, especially the one at the graveyard on Caladan near the beginning.",qd6vqv
hhucdk0,I thought the same thing. I’m so use to distant or asshole father with rebellious asshole kid. Instead we got a good father that loves his son and a kid that respects his father but is trying to find his path in life. I just hate we didn’t get more of them together,qd6vqv

hhz9pna,Made me cry,qd6vqv

higgxi9,"Piter did it a bit too, such a great way to show us their mental calculations...and demonstrate how valuable mentats are in this age without calculators",qd6vqv
hjt50vw,Yep. A shame he didn’t do shit with it. Not only are Thufir scenes extremely limited but unless I am mistaken I am not even sure they ever explain what a Mentat is. Still not sure if a lot has been cut or if Villeneuve went for an extreme version of “show don’t tell”.,qd6vqv

hhww11n,"I agree it would have been nicer honestly to see the rooms inside the homes on their home planet to have been more filled and ""homely"". Then they could have contrasted nicely with Arrakis feeling more open and empty to make it feel more foreign and hostile",qd6vqv
hhwovlt,"It's a cool look, but sometimes I think it leaves everything feeling very empty and sparse.  I had a similar thought with Blade Runner 2049 - the original Blade Runner by comparison had much more cluttered rooms sometimes and that lead to a more lived-in feeling.",qd6vqv

So basically comics during the Golden Age were basically in Europe Japan and America.

America has superheros and were shot like they were catalogues with the characters always facing the camera

Europe was known for their world building. Huge vistas was the main draw.

hi0ehf9,"Okay this seems like the the thread to ask this in:

People compare this movie to Lord of the Rings, but having that comparison in my head made me realize something: it felt rather joyless the whole time. Like there wasn't much to endear me to Paul personally. Not that Timothee Chalamet can't act, but aside from the one conversation where he expresses doubt to his father, I just don't see much of the light that needs defending.

The feeling I'm looking for is well-established in just about every new location in LotR, but it's most obvious in the very beginning. You get the hobbits just being all cute and chill with each other, then their wizard friend shows up and does fireworks for them, there's hijinks and friends and secret crushes and all of it feels very warm and cozy. You have a vested interest in the Shire and its inhabitants.

This movie kinda didn't make me care about the Atreides house. I think one thing the (definitely inferior overall) 1984 version has over this one is that Kyle McLachlan has an absolutely magnetic charisma that enthralls the audience to follow him and care about what brings that sweet, boyish smile to his face. As compelling and believable as this Paul is, I don't care about him as a person. I care about him as this Christ figure who is meant to bring about some larger peace as a result of living under a clearly corrupt galactic empire. 

I'm sure it's going to be great no matter how deep into the story they go, but I doubt that it's going to be the kind of thing that I (and many others really) watch year after year because the world is so relatable and human. This world is larger than real life in a way that robs its characters of their humanity to a certain extent. Like I'm really glad Jessica was as expressive as she was, because it sounds like it would have made the movie that much colder and inhumane.",qd6vqv

hhla8ml,"another person actually explained it and said it was a morphed human being. think tusk if you need a picture. 

they explained that ai was not allowed and so they did experiments using spice to enhance senses and etc and also to do genetic mutations of themselves or others. 

suspected that spider thing was the result of someone fucking around and seeing what kind of sick shit they could do and ended up turning a human being into a spider.",qd6vqv
hhpj8a2,"seriously though, like why?",qd6vqv
hhp25zo,It was a human from my understanding that got warped by the spice and genetic mutation,qd6vqv
hhozpfz,Dang I guess I missed this? Can anyone hit me with a timestamp or screengrab? Mahalo.,qd6vqv
hhyiqjn,It’s a nod to a creature invented in Jodoworsky’s Dune comic. I remember seeing it mentioned in r/dune by early reviewers. I’ll see if I can find the link,qd6vqv
hhpey7c,"I, sitting in the theater, very audibly said ""what the fuck"" when I saw that thing",qd6vqv
hhpipa9,I thought it was a gimp lmao,qd6vqv
hhqi4p2,"I wonder if it could be Wanna, Dr Yueh's wife. It is left vague in the books but we know Piter de Vries always wanted a Bene Gesserit as a play thing.

It would almost explain why the reverend mother Gaius Helen Mohiam knows it can understand her, and will obey her command, as Wanna was a Bene Gesserit.

edit:spelling of names.",qd6vqv
hhps4oo,Reminded me of Denis's use of the spider motif in Enemy. Dude just likes spiders!,qd6vqv
hhrhw4o,Weird kinky shit if ya ask me.,qd6vqv
hhtp1ba,Some bioengineer creature designed soley for being a pet.,qd6vqv
hhu91w6,I don’t know. The spider was there in the movie ‘The enemy’ too.,qd6vqv
hhq89z8,I read somewhere that it could be the house doctors wife. So I guess they didnt kill her after all...,qd6vqv
hht4lhk,Its the house head. He is severley poisoned and so cant contol his anti gravity.,qd6vqv
hhxib79,It's one of the Star Wars spiders that produces Spice on the prison planet Kessel in the old EU,qd6vqv
himyb6v,I wondered if it was the Drs wife who had been ripped limb from limb or something.,qd6vqv
hhtuuys,Yuehs wife,qd6vqv
hi771z4,The Harkonen creature immediately brought to mind the aesthetic of the proto Alien creatures of the  Ridley Scott prequel films.,qd6vqv
hhru1mj,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhw9xfq,Maybe it’s like the Dog-chairs in later books,qd6vqv
hhyacji,I don't know but I decides it was a reference to the Duke harrkonens favorite pastime of torture. Had to leave it for good reasons.,qd6vqv
hi9t8zo,I think it’s an experimental creature done by the Bene Tleilax,qd6vqv
hl8h2fp,Had to be something formerly human - since it understood human speech.,qd6vqv
i8oac8q,"It was to communicate that Leto was in a web of their design. It was cinematic language trying to show and not tell. It showed the visuals of a spider but hands at the end. It's a familiar yet disturbing image. Which foreshadows who you are about to see. 

The first half relied way more on traditional cinema language and a ton of it was done through shape and scale.

TL;DR it's mean to illicit the imagery of a spiders web and what might be caught there before revealing the villains.",qd6vqv
hidpdhm,I think it was more of a symbolism thing to portray how powerful that character was to to convey her influence. Like it doesn't matter what that creature is. It was a pet that even Skarsgaard's character had trouble telling what to do.,qd6vqv
hhplb30,"Damn, that's a good catch. You're absolutely right. Pretty cool.",qd6vqv
hhr7kp2,Excellent catch. The bullfighter symbolism come full circle with House Atreides.,qd6vqv
hhs8iij,"I thought his visions were telling him, that he himself had to die in order to become the one, and that he had to follow Jamis and learn about the desert. 

What that suppose to be a metaphor? As in killing himself e.g. killing the innocent boy and become a man by taking a life, and ""following Jamis"" meant agreeing to the fight?",qd6vqv
hhrenae,"Nice. Fits with his reunion with Thufir. 

""Am I my father's son?""

""More your grandfather's, Master Paul""",qd6vqv
hhtawkt,"Thanks for this. I still don't get the specificity of having the matador grandfather in the movie, in that it is something that is so specific to Earth, down to a place and time. The painting makes it clear that he wasn't just some sort of space dude who fought animals like bulls, he was a 100% Spanish matador. The statue as well showed it, but it could be said it was a bit more general (but the flowing cape was a giveaway). I was also puzzled by the bag pipes for the same reason.",qd6vqv
hhplqou,Oh shit. Good catch.,qd6vqv
hhqrzxf,Is that why there was so much bull fighter imagery?,qd6vqv
hhtfpul,That whole fight scene was just amazing.,qd6vqv
hhtuf7f,That's an amazing detail.,qd6vqv
hhu2usb,Was Jamis the same Fremen that was watering the trees?,qd6vqv
hhxs4l0,"I was wondering all movie what the matador was going to be a reference to, thank you for pointing that out.",qd6vqv
hl1duna,"Ahhh ok

I was thinking there was some kind of Spanish theme with atreides then was told well its g pm ancient Greeks lol",qd6vqv
hhxmlqf,Good catch,qd6vqv
hj8ubs2,Ahhh...so that's why he was looking at that bull piece,qd6vqv
hhtsn1k,There was also a bull statue in a shot earlier on foreshadowing the exact movie,qd6vqv
i2f493a,Great pick up,qd6vqv
hhsr2z4,"Na it's in the book too. They drop down with suspensors  into a cave where thufir  is hiding with some troops and fremen. 

Looks sooo good on film.",qd6vqv
hhnneu0,The movie actually made the sardakar much more scary than the book did. In the book most of the fear is said but not seen.,qd6vqv
hhtvs1v,Like Lady Gaga in the Superbowl,qd6vqv
him41dr,I thought it was bizarre they were wearing Sardaukar uniforms. Aren't they supposed to be wearing Harkonnen uniforms so no one knows that the Emperor is involved?,qd6vqv
hhxul4i,They better be fucking OP. They're my favorite units in the RTS.,qd6vqv
hi8r5b5,"Felt very similar to the entrance in The Arrival. Well, it’s the same director",qd6vqv
hl1dzxk,"Yeah, I was a bit confused by it as hadn't read the books. Was eery and cool though",qd6vqv
hnj08m5,Coolest movie armies I've seen since stormtroopers honestly. The way they descend from the skies just slow enough to look unnatural was excellent.,qd6vqv
hr27l9l,Terrifying right,qd6vqv
hhn6w9r,"Was thinking about that as I fell asleep last night. I wonder what else was cut, would love an extended version.",qd6vqv
hho0omo,"I thought they were gonna have a more audible version of the litany against fear. I was excited for that. Unfortunately both times they used it it just sounded like ""I must not fear"" then mumbling",qd6vqv
hhrk2bp,"I can actually spot a lot of dialogue cuts in the film. Example being when we first see Duncan Idaho. Paul greets him ""oh so you're going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team?"" It was said in a way as if Paul just found out from Duncan that he's leaving. It felt like there was a cut there.  

I also discovered there is a cut of Duncan Idaho flying and entering the Arrakis atmosphere,and landing on Arrakis as one of most stunning visuals on film. I must see it.


Jason Momoa alluded to that DV was asked to trim it down. 

I truly hope there will be a long extended cut on Bluray release.",qd6vqv
hhnyy7z,I thought that scene went way too fast.,qd6vqv
hhnxqvm,Yessss! I knew something was missing from that scene and I couldn’t figure out what it was. It really sets the tone that everyone knows the Atredies’ are walking into a trap,qd6vqv
hhoswhq,"There were a lot of places that interesting dialogue was cut. I get it, you can't include everything, but still.",qd6vqv
hhnwh0b,That dialogue specifically is what first got me excited for the movie.,qd6vqv
hhr6rzh,"My guess is that in the final cut, they decided it could give too much of the subsequent plot away (even though it was in the trailer).

It was why I was not that surprised that they cut the book line, ""...for the father... nothing,"" in the exchange between Jessica and Mohiam.",qd6vqv
hhoz6gc,My first thought on watching this is that I can't wait for the next cut. Call it what you like but there is obviously tons of footage to consider and a world of options for pacing.,qd6vqv
hirthbp,"The whole Gob Jabbar scene outside of the test felt really rushed, just like a bunch of other big scenes I remember from the book, but that's why Dune is so hard to condense into a feature-length film.",qd6vqv
hhtat5h,This dialogue definitely should have stayed!,qd6vqv
hi7n866,"It really felt like the movie was lacking in good foreshadowing. This exchange was so perfect. Plus I really wanted the whole “And for the father, nothing”",qd6vqv
hhpitsl,Which is stupid because it would have helped explain things. Love the novel but my wife never read it and she was lost. Too many things left out. Confusing.,qd6vqv
hhwa2x0,There was a lot of dialog I wish were in the movie,qd6vqv
hibhv5g,I want a director's cut,qd6vqv
hhxv882,"There is a LOT not shown. There are ""scenes"" out there that show Paul with what assumed to be Fedaykin as well as Chani and he riding a sandworm. I wonder if the scene we see in the trailers is part of a flashback that we see in a sequel, or simply one of the reshoots that were spoken of in Dec 2020",qd6vqv
hiwikfc,"Wouldn't that kind of tip her hand a bit though? She's clearly working against them behind the scenes, so I can see why that would be cut, since we get the gist later on without her straight up saying it to Paul.",qd6vqv
hhr1s2l,"I was super disappointed by this movie. It left out so many crucial points, lacks explanations so my friends who hadn't read the books had no idea what the hell was going on. For example, gom jabbar scene, there is no explanation for what he feels is happening to his hand in the box, just acid trip/fever dream cuts to scenes of fire and desert which looked comically bad; the Baron needing suspensors because he is too fat to support his own weight (friend asked why this guy can fly, since movie never covers it); ALL dialogue from the Duke about his struggles, worries, strategy, his suspicions of Jessica on Arrakis: ALL dialogue between Jessica and the Duke about what was happening with their son, and their own relationship (the Duke's line in the movie ""I should have married you"" makes no sense as they have never once discussed the fact she was a concubine in the movie up until this point, and then never bring it up again).

Jessica being reduced to a blubbering crybaby in the movie.

Jamis fight happening almost immediately?? And then nothing about the ceremony for recovering his water after.

Gurney/Duncan/Yueh getting maybe 10 minutes of screen time.

Never showed the training dummy robot things in action.

Liet Kynes never talking about his/her dream for changing Arrakis.

No explanations from the Baron on how this will work in his favor, installing Rabban to squeeze Arrakis so down the line he can swap in Feyd Rautha.

Thufir Hawat appears in the film only to fail at discovering the hunter seeker and is never really seem again. Pitir de Vries also barely has an appearance, and his dialogue/planning for the overthrow of Atreides and installing Rabban is missing.

There's probably a ton more but this is just off the top of my head.

Clunky ass dialogue throughout. Sometimes great acting, sometimes straight-to-DVD acting. Some moments were just so, so bad.

Cinematography was great though. They really should have done it as a miniseries instead, as the pacing was just so damn fast it feels like events are just happening one after the other with no connection between them.",qd6vqv
hi286ps,I feel like that makes sense. That makes it sound like his house was on the downturn but everything in the movie suggest His house was solid.,qd6vqv
hhp9xhy,"Wasn't in the book anyway. It was garbage dialogue. In the book ""for the father... nothing.""",qd6vqv
hiankst,"At a certain point I was like ""I don't know if this is cool or just hurts my eyes.""",qd6vqv
hhoeyfz,Haha I always wonder if anyone else is bothered by stark cuts to brightness. The Last Duel had a couple of those as well.,qd6vqv
hiw4o3h,Same. I almost wondered if it was intentional to make you feel that desert heat/sun.,qd6vqv
hippkpu,So harsh on the eyes! But then I thought it was kinda genius during the hallucination scene to have it go back and forth like that for the viewer,qd6vqv
hhoj7sr,Did you watch it in a theater? I feel like when I rewatch it at home these cuts will perhaps be a little easier on the eyes,qd6vqv
hl8kbpz,"It was probably meant to be jarring, but to be honest I was irritated.",qd6vqv
i8oafc9,"I wonder what you thought not The Last Jedi which I had to walk out of because it's arrogant use of pure white to pure black.

Amateur hour.",qd6vqv
hhmiyyz,"It's scenes like this that really make the world feel alive. It could have just been a generic scene of them talking to eachother with the army in the background, but the creative choices make it really compelling. Especially because not everything is explained. What does the ritual mean, what is the throat singing guy saying? It doesn't matter. It's just a quick glimpse of a much larger universe outside of this story, you fill in the rest with your own imagination.",qd6vqv
hhpvlbe,That and when we first cut to the Harkonen world blew my mind. The Score was insane,qd6vqv
hhworhw,This scene will stick stick with me for the rest of my life. If was so foreign and yet so tangible. It's one of the best scenes I've ever seen.,qd6vqv
hhvlmxx,"Great bit of world-building between the Sadakaur planet and Giedi Prime where the Harkonnens live, Dennis definitely a good job making the universe seem massive",qd6vqv
hj2f86r,"Exactly! It told so much without spelling it out. 

There were a few seconds in the cinema where I thought ""why are those guys upside down?"" And then the little head smearing seconds before made sense.  Such a dark, dark moment.  

Like the (potential spoilers in an earlier film) >!Sicario - corpses in the wall!<, Villeneuve is really good at showing and not telling. Letting the audience fill in their own ""blanks"" of the horror of the moment",qd6vqv
hj51djb,"That was my favorite scene Too, very strong imagery. 
It felt almost Giger-Esque to me, with the human sacrifices.

Edit: being allowed just  a short glimpse Into a dark, mysterious world here reminded me of that short sequence in Alien-Covenant where you see the black liquid released on the planet of the engineers. Just a short sequence, but it makes you want to see more.",qd6vqv
hhv6dpo,That scene legit had me sinking back into my chair gripping the arm rests. I was so uncomfortable and the IMAX was deafening. It was totally utterly inhuman. I loved it.,qd6vqv
hi5ytna,">Apocalypto

God, I fucking loved this film when it first came out. Thanks for the rewatch reminder.",qd6vqv
hih8wxp,"This is where Hollywood is at its best, not afraid to go with big crazy spectacle. The sound design, set design, effects, costuming is just so top notch and requires so many top professionals at the height of their powers.",qd6vqv
hk96roh,"Easily my favorite scene and it would not be an overstatement to say that in some sense, without it I might have not liked the film as much. It is the most 'artistic' scene you could get in Hollywood and I was mostly impressed with how creative the artistic direction is in this movie - as in, how they chose to portray that, in a way that doesn't look pretentious or filmic, it just felt so genuine and grotesque, very surprised to see it in a Hollywood blockbuster.",qd6vqv
hjwjhzc,I loved how they used Mongolian throat singing for that scene. Really unique. Well done Zimmer!!,qd6vqv
hiwj2ta,It was like a planet full of Cenobites.,qd6vqv
hlwtcsk,That and the spaceships. They reminded me of Alien/Prometheus,qd6vqv
hl1eizo,Did feel like prometheus,qd6vqv
i8oalxq,"You nailed it. This is the power of visual storytelling. In just a few frames you communicate so much. Saldy the last half of the movie is show more like a made for TV movie and all those vistas are gone.

I recommend the Heavy Metal magazines if you want a story told in a panel.

hhlkrxe,When his antigravity suspenders activate there is a really fitting sound effect as well. Very nicely done by the effects team,qd6vqv
hhv50q4,"I love that you noticed his foot too.  Just added to the scale of his body and the dependency he has on the suspensors.  

I also have to add that just before that, the out of focus shot of his dark mass rising and gliding toward the camera was so amazing and intimidating.",qd6vqv
hho534x,">  it is not at all how I pictured it in the book.

because he didn't fly in the book. The suspensors just made him being able to walk effortlessly like a buoy. You know those baby-chairs with wheels in which they run? It was like that, no flying. But it's a fairly cool addition my the movie",qd6vqv
hhsuclc,"Knowing absolutely nothing about Dune before seeing this, the first time he levitated, I thought he was a humanoid Jabba the Hutt style snake person or something",qd6vqv

hhl3asm,"r/Dune's book club that they did on their Discord, by chance? That's where I read it for the first time.

My workplace also just started a book club a few weeks ago. There were approximately 10 books up for vote for the first book. Unsurprisingly, Dune won.",qd6vqv
hhocz36,He looked terrifying as he was floating over the sardaukar in the palace. Everything that looked silly in Lynch's Dune looked so menacing.,qd6vqv
hhpznkk,When I read the books I always pictured that fat dude floating around from the the second Jak and Daxter game. I think that it's safe to say Villenue's interpretation is better than mine.,qd6vqv
hhmh24v,"I wish the Baron had been given more dialog, he was well known for his plotting and discussing the plots (at least what he wanted people to know about them) with all those around them. Pieter's character is also just barely present and they don't emphasize how evil he was enough.",qd6vqv
hhsmq44,"When I first saw it and it was out of focus, I thought he just had like super long legs.",qd6vqv
hhtsudb,"So much better than the comical way it was depicted in the Lynch film, where he seemed to move like a balloon.",qd6vqv
hhzjqbt,"I noticed the foot as well! How droopy they were when they touched the table, as if they were part of the fabric. It showed just how little he attempts at trying to walk.",qd6vqv
hi1ka25,They used some of the visual language that Cuarón did in *Prisoner of Azkaban* to great effect.,qd6vqv
hhr47s9,Yeah he waddles in the books,qd6vqv
hhu10il,In the book the suspensors just assist in carrying his weight.  He doesn’t actually float around.  The visual was cool enough that it doesn’t really bother me though.,qd6vqv
him64sr,well this comment makes me want to read the book now after watching the film,qd6vqv
hjqd84m,"As someone who did not read the book, when I first saw him float, I assumed he was actually a serpent-man hybrid. His long gown makes it look like he's a snake lmao.",qd6vqv
hhmkgus,"Yeah I always imagined it as a giant chair or something. I like this change, makes him look even more sinister.",qd6vqv
hhu52t3,I always pictured it in the book like a belt device that he wore that floated him off the ground. Kinda like a balloon,qd6vqv
hi6turx,It reminded me of that scene from The Eye,qd6vqv
hkxzkp6,He reminds me of the Shadow King in Legion and that's why he was so creepy to me.,qd6vqv
hnizy08,Oh shit I thought that guy was the emperor lol,qd6vqv
hnkpdnw,Oh shit he was floating? I thought he had really long extendable legs. Not even kidding lol,qd6vqv
i1hokt7,baron reminded me of Varys,qd6vqv
hhopwk2,"I agree, but I think what contributes to that desire is how awesome his visuals and manners were in the small amount of screen time he got. 

They also really reduced, almost cut the Harkonnen mentat Peter de Vries, who was the person that came up with the whole maneuver and plans within plans. A shame.",qd6vqv
hhm3cu9,The most interesting thing about the Baron is his inner dialogue which is understandably something that is hard to portray in a movie,qd6vqv
hhoi2pv,Baron was awesome. Dude looked creepy and was so ruthless. I wanna see how the Emperor who set up everyone is portrayed. That guy is head scumbag.,qd6vqv
hhomgd8,"Stellan Skarsgard's performance of Baron was just chilling and brilliant. Whenever he shows up on screen, I can't help but feel scared shitless. He's just how I imagined Harkonnen when I read the book.",qd6vqv

hhtarhb,"The Baron is the one thing I think Lynch unequivocally did better. This Baron is just... not having any fun. He's the wealthiest man in the universe, owns a planet, wakes up every morning in a bed full of elite catamites and immediately starts gorging himself on gourmet foods and exotic space drugs. His life rules and he (at least in the book and other movie) fucking loves it.",qd6vqv
hhnqpr8,I want more everything.,qd6vqv
hhnw2su,Fucking loved the Baron.,qd6vqv
hhpxwpb,"He was so good. All the Harkonnens too. I was also disappointed how little we got of Pieter.  Absolute perfect casting and we got very little of him. I wish we got more scenes on Giede Prime. I was kinda bummed they cut out all of Count Fenring because that would've given us a lot more time with the Harkonnens. We missed out on Feyd's duel too, but that could be slotted into part 2.",qd6vqv
hhlzld5,More to come in Part 2!,qd6vqv
hhobnb2,You’ll probably get more baron in part two.,qd6vqv
hhoicbg,I wanted them to bring up that the baron is Paul’s grandpa and jessicas dad is that a lil too much .,qd6vqv
hhqzf9h,"I think the first movie had two main goals: worldbuilding/context and setting up Paul's fall / eventual rise.


I *really* hope that with the majority of worldbuilding and setting up the protagonist(s) done that there will be more time to dedicate to the Harkonnens & Emperor!",qd6vqv
hhnldyq,Agree. He was badass.,qd6vqv
hhp1pi5,Barons got apacolypse now brando vibes,qd6vqv
hhpu5wq,Hopefully they green light part two. Skarsgaard is chilling as Harkonnen and I love it.,qd6vqv
hhui6bt,"I loved the sound effect of his back brace, and hovering tech. Really added some heft to his character.",qd6vqv
hi23g0y,I thought the baron's wardrobe was very peculiar. I expected his clothes to be insanely opulent but instead he wore a plain muumuu most of the time. Maybe he's just so rich he doesn't have to care but still struck me as odd.,qd6vqv
hhpzl07,"Book Baron is utterly fucked up. It's heavily implied that he routinely has teenage boys fucked up with drugs used in sexual ways for pleasure, and slowly kills them or tortured them but in a way where they almost consent to it.

There's also another Harkonen character that's like a protege but that also wants the Baron dead and actively plays this game of murder plot after murder plot. I don't think it'll be in the movie. In the Lynch version it's played by Sting.",qd6vqv

hhqwthd,Yes. In my opinion the Baron in the original stole the show. He was easily the best thing about that movie and was a total messed up psycho. The new Baron is pretty dull in comparison. Enjoyed the movie overall though.,qd6vqv

It's been a long, long time since I've read the book but in the Lynch version he is so over the top psychotic that he just screams evil.

hjwjgz6,"I feel the same way, I got such a strong reaction from that introduction to the Sardaukar.

hhkwmt1,"It would take balls *not* to label it Part 1 and have people thinking this is supposed to be a self-contained movie and the ending is the ending, especially when it's not a full story. Then you'd have a lot of confused people who don't even realize why the ending doesn't feel right.

There's not a whole lot he could do to split the book in two and somehow provide a whole satisfying story in just the first half. Unfortunately that's just not really the way the narrative works, so large changes would have to be made.

At the same time, he probably didn't want to try and force the whole book into one movie, because it's so expansive that you would have to cut out and rush through a whole bunch of stuff to fit it into even 3 hours.",qd6vqv

I'd been hoping for a long movie if it covered the first book (like 3 hours +) and was disappointed when I glanced at the running time (I watched from home) and saw that it was only 2 1/2 hours.  It wasn't until I was about 2/3 of the way through the movie that I realized the first book was going to be a two-parter.",qd6vqv
hhomz5u,"I kinda thought this was a song and dance (that there really is a possibility they won't make another Dune) - Why would Villeneuve intentionally make a bad movie (in the context of a standalone film, and a viewership that has primarily not read the book) and why would the studio back this play? Wouldn't they want a film that's a little more meat and potatoes? That gets Paul to become Usul like 30 minutes in rather than NOT AT ALL by the end of Part 1?

IDK, it's totally possible there have been lots of unsuccessful franchise launches recently and I can believe that the studio wasn't going to make the whole series before seeing how Part 1 premiered - but I personally think Part 2 was all but guaranteed if Part 1 wasn't an absolute disaster.",qd6vqv

That's CLEARLY post-acceptance in to the seitch as a fremen. He has the fremen eyes and the person behind Chani COULD be a feydakin as both he and Paul are in the same garb, neither being stillsuits AND paul has the showing of a 5' o clock shadow

He took the duke ring and said ""for paul""",qd6vqv

My friend was the Emperor and had so much money and more forces than me that I didn't even know what to do, felt backed against a wall the entire time. Then he made and alliance with my wife who was the spacing guild and completely destroyed me

 I highly recommend anyone to play the game it weaves in the series lore and elements from the first book really well.",qd6vqv

hhlkg6i,"I was beyond glad they never even gave us a preview of the voice. 

The delayed/muffled voice and then the sudden jerking of Paul to his knees before The Reverend Mother really conveyed this idea that your free will just vanishes. In cinema was the best first impression of it",qd6vqv
hhkxtyv,KILL HIM,qd6vqv
hhl7wxu,And when the Atreides ships come out of the water.. holy shiiiiit,qd6vqv
hhkwlgn,I for sure went out of the theater to fetch Paul that glass of water.,qd6vqv

hhl0l57,"The best adaptation of Bene Gesserit witchcraft! It was far beyond my expectation. The weirding way should have been more like shield technology in execution (if that makes sense). Super long, but as a fan of the novels it kept the mystery.",qd6vqv
hhl2om1,"Lots of theaters call themselves IMAX, but my state just had their one and only true IMAX theater shut down a couple years back.

It breaks my heart that I won't get to see this film on a screen the size of a building.

I did catch Interstellar there though.  The launch sequence was probably the most I've ever seen a place physically shake from sound.",qd6vqv
hhll3no,how was the Sardaukar throat singing part tho...,qd6vqv
hhm59ht,"It was amazing! 

Although at times I felt like my Imax theater was just too loud - I literally had to cover my ears during a few parts because it was almost painful. 

I just hope they turn it down a notch for kid friendly movies because that volume just can’t be safe for kids.",qd6vqv
hhlhofi,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhm4bzx,"Seriously. I don’t really care too much about the Oscars, but Dune better win the Academy Award for Best Sound. I mean… it’s just incredible. As much as Villeneuve was able to convey the scale of things in this film — like when the Guild ship arrives at Arrakis and the various smaller ships look minuscule next to it, only to be shown to be absolutely massive when they land on the planet in the next shot, showing indirectly how *enormous* the Guild ship truly is — the sound design just blew me away. 

When Jessica told Paul to use the Voice on her at the beginning, I thought that maybe he’d just speak to her in a peculiarly stern tone or something, but no, the way the Voice was done took me by surprise and was just really, really cool.",qd6vqv
hhot8dq,"In my theater the soundtrack overpowered the dialog which was super annoying. Couldn't understand a lot of intense scenes. For me it was fine because I know the book, but my wife was lost sometimes. Hopefully it was just my theater.",qd6vqv
hhmyfhb,I saw it in Dolby and the vibrating seats along with the sound really added to the effect!,qd6vqv
hhofbbe,one of the first movies I've seen where it's a must see in the theater for the soundscape as much as the visuals,qd6vqv
hhm26hh,"I also watched in imax and some stuff was just way too loud, was that just my theatre?",qd6vqv
hhl9cj7,First time watching a movie at a Dolby Cinema and it was sooo worth the extra money. Action scenes were intense,qd6vqv
hhlghrq,I almost stabbed someone,qd6vqv
hhlgo9m,The sound design for the voice in Imax was like a magic trick. It used the surround sound so well but not in a gimmicky way at all.,qd6vqv
hhlkd8i,"It's the vibration. When I watch it on the small screen, it doesn't feel the same. When the Reverend Mother used it, my entire body shook. It's.. unreal.",qd6vqv

hhrr0ym,Oh fuck you for making me buy another set of tickets to watch in imax,qd6vqv

I know my sonos sub will not fail me now!",qd6vqv
hhmcfnc,"I watched it in a small theatre and was fairly underwhelmed tbh. To the IMAX we go ! 

But srsly why did they compress the timeline and have the Jamis fight happen outside and so quickly, and in full still suits?",qd6vqv
hhmtq0j,"I couldn't help but rewatch the first 30 mins or so on HBOMax after driving back from the theater. I put headphones on, and that sound work is just so spot on!

hhphgkn,[deleted],qd6vqv
hht7b7h,I watched it in IMAX and now on HBO Max on the OLED.  IMAX helps emphasize the large scale of the ships and the sound is even more amazing.  Definitely worth watching in IMAX.,qd6vqv

hhmpp20,I just added a second Martinlogan 1100x to my home theater...  a picture feel if the wall upstairs... it was su fucking cool,qd6vqv
hhmx1c2,I'm pissed. I think the sound in my IMAX was fucked up. The audio and score were good but I thought there was a distinct lack of bass. And the motherfuckers left a light on in the projector room.,qd6vqv

hhswi1o,The imax sound effects were amazing but I was not able to hear any dialogue whenever they were in a thopter or anywhere an engine was whirring!,qd6vqv

hhtgf8u,"First movie I've seen in Atmos. The shield, the thropter, the cone of silence. The sound design gave me an eargasm.",qd6vqv
hhvc2wl,"I was disappointed in the “IMAX” theater I watched this in. The sound was to bright, to a point where I cringed. There was no low frequency channel. I want to go watch it again at a different theater.",qd6vqv
hhwyese,Just watched it in a shitty cinema in Stoke where the projector lens was out of focus the whole movie and the audio was super quiet and this comment made me really really sad,qd6vqv
hhlltkr,"Sadly the original concept of Voice was being able to  choose the right tone and words to make someone do something, not so much a special universal command sound. But I guess would have taken too long in movie time to explain.",qd6vqv
hhrvwsf,Watched it in imax and hated it. Might've been that I haven't been to a theater in years but fuck I was deaf by the end of that movie. Felt almost as bad as Dunkirk in imax (although that might be overkill as a comparison). Anyone also notice how grainy it was? Didn't feel very HD.,qd6vqv
hhlxn6m,Holy shit man you’re not lying!! I was wondering how DV would flesh out his version of the voice and I was nowhere near disappointed!! Chest cavitation action when it was used,qd6vqv
hhmvibt,It woke my kids up twice at home.,qd6vqv
hhnyo2t,I love how they did that. Every time they used it it felt like a punch. In a good way.,qd6vqv
hho7b6e,"THIS, IMAX film quality was obviously top notch however every audio effect was absolutely impeccable.",qd6vqv
hhp58v8,I shook too. I knew it was coming but the IMAX rattling the theatre always jolted me.,qd6vqv
hhpyozl,"I told myself I was going to watch it for the first time in IMAX. But I got off work, and there it was sitting on my dashboard. I couldn't resist. I'll probably see it again in theatres, but I do kind of regret watching it for the first time at home on my lame ass TV.",qd6vqv
hhqjzbl,"I don’t understand why they didn’t use the voice more often, like when they were cornered in the desert at the end.",qd6vqv
hhr6fg3,Yeah I think the sound was what really made it worth it to see in IMAX. I felt like I was actually IN the ornithopters the way everything shook.,qd6vqv
hhsq1dc,"I watched it on my tv and immediately knew I’d need to go back for a theater viewing. The score was absolutely bone-shaking at times, haven’t heard anything like it since Annihilation",qd6vqv
hht73kq,I feel like they neutered the sound at my IMAX showing :(,qd6vqv
hhl53b3,I think he will get that name in the sietch at some point in part 2. They changed the fight location in the movie so it doesn't make sense him getting that name without any other Fremen witnessing. But they did call him with his other titles. Lisan Al-Gaib and Mahdi in the film.,qd6vqv
hhl7fe5,"They don't say it, but muad'dib is shown several times throughout the movie which I thought was a really great touch.",qd6vqv
hhoi335, Chani says it once,qd6vqv
hhlrgcv,"They showed the mouse a few times, but he choses that name after he is accepted by the Fremen, so I reckon that will be an early scene in part 2. No one would have known to use it up until then. The readers of the book know about it before that point because of all the blurbs from Irulan at the beginning of each chapter.",qd6vqv
hhr8dbr,Paul chooses the name as a tiny “fuck you” to destiny because he’s never seen it in his visions. It’s basically the only thing that he gets to decide for himself from this point onwards.,qd6vqv
hhq9q4l,"I think that's being saved mostly for the second movie they used Lisan al-gaib as the initial foreign name for Paul, and I don't think they wanted to overburden the non-book audience with too many Messianic names. They included the actual Muad'dib desert mouse, and I have no doubt that Part II will include a significant emphasis of the role Paul takes up as the Muad'dib in the Fremen culture.",qd6vqv
hhml2rz,I thought the name Muad’dib was more important when Paul gets to thr Sietch.,qd6vqv
hhr3gqv,"They have no reason to say ""Muad'dib"" in this movie. It's the name Paul chooses for himself after being accepted into the Fremen. That will probably happen at the start of the sequel.",qd6vqv
hhv2dcy,"I might need to go back to the book, but I believe the first time it really comes up in the book is during his vision in the tent. When he gets the visions of the legions of Fremen taking their jihad to the stars chanting his name, he hears them chanting Muad'dib.

>!The impact later on, of course, being when he is given his name, he chooses the desert mouse not knowing it's called Muad'dib and it confirms part of his vision.!<",qd6vqv
hho78ko,Because he didn’t choose his name yet. Probably one of the first scenes in part 2,qd6vqv
hhog8mi,"Also 'Never one drop of rain on Arrakis' and the 'The sleeper must awaken'. I understand trying to distant yourself from Lynch's version, but those are some of the most iconic lines in Dune, the latter serving as the most important connection between father and son after Leto's death. I wanna hear 'Father, the sleeper has awakened!' so much in part 2.",qd6vqv
hhvn4u1,The little mouse being shown in the film 4-5 times was reference to this.,qd6vqv
hhx0a4k,I'm sure I heard it,qd6vqv
hhv2wvm,They definitely said it at least once. Chani calls it Muad'dib right at the end. I feel like they may have mentioned it when he was researching Arrakis also but I may be wrong. I know they at least showed it there though so non readers should be familiar enough with it by the time he gets it as a Sietch name.,qd6vqv
hhruk1w,"I think I heard Chani say it, although it sounded different than I expected. It all flowed together into a single sound.

I could be wrong. It was very near the end.",qd6vqv
hhnxr9z,I was waiting for it in the last 1/4th as well haha,qd6vqv
hhofcpt,In the book Paul doesn't learn the word until they've boned.,qd6vqv
hhr5vo1,I thought thats how the first movie would end ngl,qd6vqv
hhre4ry,"I KNEW IT!

I was listening and for a moment I felt that I had gone crazy, because I couldn't hear it!",qd6vqv
hhslwd6,"It is said at least once. I remember because they pronounce it ""mau-di"" with a silent B.",qd6vqv
hhtb00v,"It would have been nice if Jessica saw the mouse and said ""what is that creature called?"" and he said ""Muad'Dib. They are survivors.""",qd6vqv
hhujl8g,They are removing the Islam references so they don’t get Charlie Hebdo’d,qd6vqv
hhz90n2,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but other than Irulan saying it 1000 times at the chapter starts, isn't it only said in visions until Paul is named Usul and chooses his open name?",qd6vqv
hi019vd,I don't think I heard a single mention of CHOAM either but they talk about it every other conversation in the book.,qd6vqv
hi0l4kj,Pretty sure I heard Chani say Paul is not Muad'Dib right before the challenge from Jamis. It weirded me out since it's the name he picks himself and doesn't become apart of the legend until later. I might have heard wrong though.,qd6vqv
hi35kx0,"It’s in the book a ton during the portion the movie covers, but it’s all just the princess’s readings, and no one calls him that yet.",qd6vqv
hi4voj0,"In the book, you get it a ton because of those quoted passages from the princess at the beginning of every chapter.  They are all things like ""writings of Muad'dib"" or ""quotations from Muad'dib""",qd6vqv
hjt7kc6,"True but I appreciate that Villeneuve shows the animal repeatedly.

I just watched the movie and I am quite puzzled. Some absolutely fantastic decisions and a few that are mind boggling. That was a good one. There is some amount of build up.",qd6vqv
hhl8l0a,"I feel like this is gonna be how the movie illustrates the depravity of the Baron, rather then the pedophilia from the book. A very tasteful adaptation change lolol. 

I got big Audition vibes from that monster, unnerving stuff.",qd6vqv

hhl106w,Oh him? That’s just Greg.,qd6vqv
hhlkjlj,THAT'S HUMAN??!! I thought it was a spider...,qd6vqv
hhkyzwx,">How come no one is talking about the Harkonnen ""pet"". WTF was that? A mutilated person?

It was human, actually. I'll be using broad strokes to summarize with brevity best I can.

Unfortunately the movie never goes into this, but in the DUNE universe humanity has outlawed ""*thinking machines*."" No AI, no computers, no calculators, etc. So humanity has had to expand and develop themselves to fill the needs this void creates. 

This is where Spice is useful, it helps people tap into potential of the mind and genetics. There is a **lot** of body horror in the Dune universe because of this.

I work in film and the first half does a lot to communicate emotions before they are expressed.

So before someone shows anger there is a viusal and sound that hints it so you are primed when it happens.

This is far less the case in the second half.

hhw6cbk,He plays stilgar,qd6vqv
hhkk64w,I like how they don’t even try to hide it and have “part one” as the subtitle in the opening credits.,qd6vqv
hhkmil0,I'd even go a step further and say it felt like I binge-watched the first 3 episodes of a season (just enough to set up the plot before actually getting into narrative gear) and now I have to wait two or three years for the next episode.,qd6vqv
hhlhy1b,"Gosh, it really felt like a long pilot even. I just feel like the pacing and how little story was actually told are not great for a stand-alone movie.",qd6vqv
hhmakb6,No it just kinda stops. Almost all part one movies have a big scene at the end to culminate the entirety of the film. Just look at what they did with LotT. This one ends with a knife fight.,qd6vqv
hhlcxvm,"Hell, not even season 1. Feels like the end of a 2 hour series premiere to kick it off.",qd6vqv
hhlgf73,They should have made it very clear in the marketing that this is part 1. I don't believe I saw that anywhere until the title card on the screen as im watching the film.,qd6vqv
hhlfl33,I told my friend it felt more like watching the first four episodes or GOT’s season 1.,qd6vqv
hhmdjqx,"That's exactly what it felt like to me too, the visuals were fantastic but the story felt more like a trailer for the actual story.",qd6vqv
hhkln2w,"While watching the film, I actually had the thought that this would be better as a TV series. I am afraid they may have shot too high with a film. I don't know if the director wants to make six films or more.",qd6vqv
hhp4fgt,It definitely didn’t tell a complete story and was full of poly points that went nowhere. The only way it remotely makes sense is if all parts were filmed at once,qd6vqv
hhl3yol,"I wish it had been a premium TV series on HBO. I read the book in preparation for the film and I just don't think that the film (or even two films) will be enough to even begin to do justice to the depth of the politicking and interpersonal maneuvering that takes place in the novel. The film is beautiful and massive, yes, but it feels like it just scratches the surface of this incredibly dense story and I don't think a second movie will be enough to flesh everything out.",qd6vqv
hhknegg,Not even. Feels like it ends halfway through.,qd6vqv
hhpr0x3,"It should have been a tv show it would have been the next game of thrones for hbo. I mean it is game of fucking thrones in space. Ned and duke leto are the same characters, both walking into traps, leaving their family in peril but with a shot to get the ultimate crown. Am i taking crazy pills here?

I just doubt we will ever see movies of the later books, but a tv show could have gone there.

Any book series with a plot that cant be reduced down to drivel is going to have a hard time at the box office, but on tv that sort of shit is bread and butter. (Cough ender series cough)",qd6vqv
hhkus7w,Went from interesting world building to boring real fast.,qd6vqv
hht7i8g,"I saw a reviewer describe it as an extended prologue and can’t help but feel like it describes it very well. I loved the movie, but feel like it will be at its best when I can watch it and then immediately go see part 2 in the theaters right after",qd6vqv
hhkwz9d,"Just got out, and this SHOULD HAVE BEEN a TV show",qd6vqv
hhlhy8n,It felt more like Empire Strikes Back but without any of the good feels from A New Hope.,qd6vqv
hhlw286,more like 1st ep,qd6vqv
hhtbdea,"This didn’t even feel like a full season of a show. 

Like another user said: this is the equivalent of watching the first 3 episodes of an 8-episode season. We saw just enough to establish the plot and the characters, but we haven’t even gotten into the meat of the story yet.",qd6vqv
hhkrcto,">!""This is just the beginning"" she says, out of nowhere and out of character.!<",qd6vqv

hil9q7w,It felt like the pilot to me,qd6vqv
hhkrzrx,I loved this movie to death. My only gripe is that there should've been more emphasis on Paul never killing a man. The final fight with Jamis should've been played up way more as a turning point for his character.,qd6vqv
hhkki17,There are a lot of shows that end their first season on a climatic high note that leaves you excited for the next season/installment. This was nothing like that at all to me.,qd6vqv
hhkol2v,I don’t even feel like watching it anymore because of this.,qd6vqv
hhkmt80,Yupp,qd6vqv
hhoclfe,The actors who played the worms gained a lot of weight for this film,qd6vqv

hk9tcfv,"Best place to live though, if you like eating sand.",qd6vqv
hhpyk18,"I was kinda bummed we didn't see what would happen when they hit a shield. Seemed like they were about to go nuclear when Idaho was fiddling with his shield before he died, and shield/lasgun interaction might be a pretty important idea in part 2.",qd6vqv
hhpl5rt,"And the attention to detail: they don't start firing lasers until the city shields are down, because firing a laser at a shield triggers an atomic blast.",qd6vqv
hhp0q1s,The lasers were fucking awesome. I've always thought big Star Trek lasers were the only way to go because real world lasers don't look anywhere near so cool. But the lasers in this looks incredibly dangerous and I loved that. Especially the huge laser chasing Duncan as he flew away.,qd6vqv
hhti37q,"Wait wait wait, where were the lasguns???? What scene? The plethora of “missiles” that rained down on the city???",qd6vqv
hhps8r7,"I thought they were used way too casually. I mean, they're firing a laser directly at Duncan's shielded ornithopter? The one thing you're never supposed to do.",qd6vqv
hlruv4u,Huge Ace Combat flashbacks lmao,qd6vqv
hhx0vyu,"That’s an assembly cut. It’s not an actual cut of the movie ever intended to be viewed any anyone as any sort of “final” experience. 

Actors say shit like this all the time when they get to view an assembly, and then everyone just runs with it assumes there’s some super-long, mythical “extended cut” out there waiting. 

Assembly cuts are just that, assemblies of literally every single thing that has been shot. They’re agonizingly paced (basically because they essentially *aren’t paced at all*), full of tons of redundant footage, alternate versions of things compiled together, etc. Most films have assemblies that are at least several hours long, and most of them are unwatchable, because they’re just basically just sequentially ordered unedited footage.",qd6vqv
hhwm707,"This is normally the case with most movies and is simply part of the process of editing and getting all the usable shot footage onto a timeline - almost no director ever presents this type of cut as one that should be shown to an audience.

Saying that, I’d absolutely love more of this movie. I can’t believe how quickly this movie went by, so gutted when it ended",qd6vqv

hhs69cu,We can only hope it gets to see the light of day,qd6vqv
hj2l4ob,"One of my friends worked on this film, and saw that cut of the movie, sans score.

I'm so fucking jealous of him.",qd6vqv
hhzjrnx,My body is ready.,qd6vqv
hi026ir,I also want to see this version.,qd6vqv
hhl1hp5,"They definitely cut a bunch of pretty pivotal character development scenes from the book to save screen time. The entire subplot of searching for the traitor in their midst was basically non-existent. Mapes and Yueh barely had any screen time compared to their roles in the book, Yueh especially.

The only other major difference I noticed was the carry-all actually showing up to save the sand crawler but simply being broken. In the book the carry-all was hijacked by Harkonnen iirc, which helped drive the dinner scene in the book.

They also vastly accelerated the death of Kynes, albiet in a pretty badass way, however the way Kynes dies in the book reveals a lot of information about how the climate of Arrakis functions as well as their overall goals for terraforming the planet.

I really hope there are a bunch of deleted scenes because from what I saw in the movie, Denis did a fantastic job overall of remaining loyal to the story of the books, but it was very apparent that much had to be cut in order to fit it to movie length.

This was the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever seen, I wanted so badly for it to just keep going.",qd6vqv
hhkx254,Brolin actually played the baliset but it was cut completely from the movie. Same goes to Duncan's first arrival in arrakis,qd6vqv
hhkudel,"I need more Gurney, rather than having him as a less-badass Duncan Idaho. I know they had to cut down to a reasonable film length, but out of the most important book characters I think he really got the short end of the stick",qd6vqv
hhl076v,"I think a lot of the details from the book would make a much more boring movie. The political stuff/houses are explained a lot more, but I can see why they cut it.

It was a weird decision to cut the Hawat/Jessica confrontation though. That was one of the most interesting chapters from the first half of the novel.",qd6vqv
hhkx1sn,They could have had more time for it if they cut all the Zendaya slo-mo shots out.,qd6vqv
hhkywyt,I think the dinner scene needed to be in the film to flesh out certain characters and to understand the politics a little more and build up to the danger and because it’s cut it feels like there’s a gaping hole of character development missing,qd6vqv
hhlch1s,"Denis doesn't do extended cuts :-/

What's out is final.

Which is a massive shame, because if there's one movie that warrants the LOTR 3 hour extended version treatment, it's Dune.",qd6vqv
hhktyf6,"Exactly my thoughts in the first 10 minutes of the movie. 

""can't wait for the Villeneuve cut""",qd6vqv
hhl185p,I’d like to see any character development,qd6vqv
hhlfv43,I would want another 20-30 minutes of “politics”. It all felt shockingly straightforward and basic so I’m assuming it’s because they had to streamline so much.,qd6vqv
hhoadhz,"*Another"" 20-30 minutes of character development?

Was there even 20 minutes of character development in it?",qd6vqv
hhl4y42,"Honestly, I usually would say no since the movie is already so long but I have to agree. My biggest gripe is there was hardly any backstory on Yueh. The book really goes into detail about how much the family trusted him, so that was a very deep betrayal. They also didn’t explain mentats at all, and Thufir was barely in it",qd6vqv
hhl5u6j,How about the word mentat or the name piter lol,qd6vqv
hho2ji6,"The thing is, in the book the whole 'assault on the Atreides' happens somewhere around the middle and before that nothing much happens, right? They introduce the characters, one at a time, and tell who they are and what are their goals. You can't do that in a movie, however I do agree that it turned out not great in this regard — we really don't see any Yueh or understand his motivations, or Leto and his relationships with Jessica and Paul, so all these characters do feel kinda empty and it's hard to care about them if you didn't read the book. Like we see Yueh for 2 minutes before the *shocking* reveal that *he* was the traitor. It's hard to care for any of the characters because there is so many of them and you can't squeeze it all in the movie. 

I get what you mean and I kinda agree, but as far as book adaptations go this is still probably in my top 3",qd6vqv
hhkxfis,"Don't hold your breath. 2049 still hasn't released the extended cut, I felt the same with it as well.",qd6vqv
hhlcvdd,"Yeah, the Yueh thing feels out of nowhere in the movie.

Had to explain a bit about him to some friends after agreeing it felt rushed.",qd6vqv
hhm9qw6,"Absolutely. Given how rushed it was, it felt that Atreides were only on Arrakis for a week before the Harkonnens attacked.",qd6vqv
hhkykaz,"I agree. I really enjoyed the film, but felt like it flew by.",qd6vqv
hhl5c9r,Cutting the dinner scene hurt my soul.,qd6vqv
hhlhszs,"Anyone watching these films and not expecting a Lord of the Rings style debate is fooling themselves. There will no doubt be an extended cut at some point, but they have to cut some things out.

I didn't like what was cut from LOTR but I understood why. As someone who hasn't read Dune (yet) I'm glad I won't have to deal with that pain after watching lol.",qd6vqv
hhovv49,"Yeah the film felt really rushed to me, which is crazy considering the length. Im so glad they made the first book into a part 1 and 2. Imagine how rushed it would be if the whole book was one film.",qd6vqv
hhkvh4a,"Same, *especially* of the Baron. He felt like he was in this film less than chani.",qd6vqv
hhlx31h,Villeneuve has said he will never do directors cuts,qd6vqv
hhmw2tl,I can’t wait for the super cut with added scenes and both movies made into one epically huge 7+ hour film. Here’s hoping anyway,qd6vqv
hhpm2jh,If WB can give Snyder a 4 hour cut of Justice League we should get the 4 hour cut of Dune.,qd6vqv
hhych60,"I’d like to see….any character development, honestly.  They all felt remarkably hollow.",qd6vqv
hhkwa2n,"This, it does feel in certain moments/scenes that there were cuts, it would be cool to have at least 20 more min in an extended edition.",qd6vqv
hhlilhp,Im gutted the dinner scene wasnt in.,qd6vqv
hhmtlgg,"Yeah, I could've done with more time compression in the desert as they searched for the Fremen. Also I could have done with better telegraphing of the time passage between Atreides arriving at the planet and the siege.",qd6vqv
hhmwix8,And this is exactly why this movie should have been a TV show. It really really needs to breathe. 14 hours of this would have been perfect. People died and I didn't feel the weight of their death.,qd6vqv
hhmxxfb,"Definetly, they used a lot of moments from the book down to the sentence. and they covered a good amount of the first half. I think they could easily add a good 30 minutes more of exchanges, like the whole Duke pretending being suspicious of Jessica plotline would be quite interesting to see on screen.",qd6vqv
hhnv2bg,Director indicated this is the film and recuts aren't happening,qd6vqv
hhp8pwq,Really this should be the next Game of Thrones. Both because it needs the time but also because I didn't want it to end.,qd6vqv
hhpzgpz,"100%. The pacing was excellent, but I missed some of the quiet, pleasant bits the Atreides experienced on Arrakis. Obviously they know he's in danger, but we didn't get some of the nice moments between Leto, Jessica, and Paul. We barely saw some important characters like Hawat. I know the studio gave Villenue a lot of freedom with this movie, but considering his love of the books and Bladerunner 2049s performance at the box office I feel like a lot of constraints were still placed on him. It was amazing and I know I shouldn't complain, but I would gladly sit through a 4 1/2 hour Dune Part 1.",qd6vqv
hhqqbn2,There wasn't a ton of dialog which I was suprised about.,qd6vqv
hhrue5h,"Honestly, I wouldn't mind a 5 hour directors cut.",qd6vqv
hht7g3i,"Loved the film, but really wishing this was a trilogy instead of a two parter. Would have given a lot more time for character development. A few scenes happened very quickly as well, like the hunter seeker scene. First film could have ended with the Harkonnen  attack.",qd6vqv
hhw8p2o,Same. It definitely feels like there will be tons of material to eventually release an extended version.,qd6vqv
hhwij9x,I could legit watch another 8 hours of this. I really want to see an extended cut too.,qd6vqv
hhwnhwh,"As I was watching it, I had the thought several times “that one line of dialogue encompasses pages of development in the books. If you haven’t read the books, it’s going to make no fucking sense.“",qd6vqv
hhxe73e,Yes. I felt the Baron was too one dimensional.,qd6vqv
hi2vogp,I think Denis has gone on record that he doesn’t do directors or extended cuts for his pictures.,qd6vqv
hi2wicp,I thought I read that he intentionally only made 1 cut? Similar to like a Tarantino film.  Make the version you want and nothing else.,qd6vqv
hibeu5t,"The mentats were done dirty in this regard, I think, and the idea that Paul had mentat training as well as Bene Gesseritt training. But it's hard to include EVERYthing. If there's an extended cut or whatever, I'm all in.",qd6vqv
hhkmbac,Only the original 6 books please - no need for [Brian Herbert's Accountants of Dune](https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Simpsons-Dune.png).,qd6vqv

hhljs0r,3 Billion dollar TV show here we go!,qd6vqv
hhpr8sh,"I have written this so many times but it should have been a god damn tv show. It would have been a smash fucking hit the next game of thrones, similar plot but with different themes. Drives me nuts no one in the warners hbo family realized this.",qd6vqv
hhkmra4,An HBO series was already announced!,qd6vqv
hhycprl,The longest pilot too.  Felt like the plot of a 60-90 minute episode stretched out over 2.5 hours.,qd6vqv
hhznsfc,"Weekly series like GoT, The Expanse is ending",qd6vqv
hhkqgy7,exactly my thought. I enjoyed it and and hope it gets picked up as an actual tv/netflix show format,qd6vqv
hjm3cdb,Made no sense making the movie this long,qd6vqv
hhvs1pq,I’m convinced Hans Zimmer has a secret mission to make as many people as he can go deaf before he dies.,qd6vqv
hjguuf4,I just finished watching it and I loved the soundtrack but your comment just about killed me with laughter...,qd6vqv
i2tu59g,What do you think about him winning the Oscar?,qd6vqv
hhl38km,"This movie has a lot of rich snapshots of the world, but it doesn't lean into them long enough to appreciate the weight of each detail.

That scene about the trees requiring the same amount of water to sustain 5 people each, Stilgar spitting as a sign of respect as he's offering moisture. The book has dozens and dozens of more examples like these and it really drives home the message.",qd6vqv
hhmh6y9,"One thing that bothered me was, we were told it's unbearably hot but I never felt like any of the characters seemed bothered by the heat.",qd6vqv
hhlckre,"This is felt MUCH more in the second half. I remember people hyping up this element of the books when I originally read it, and the water discipline thing didn't seem like a big deal to me either... until it was.

Basically, now that Paul and Jessica are going to be living in the desert, the lack of water is quickly going to become a much more important aspect of the worldbuilding.",qd6vqv
hhmful5,"The entire movie takes place in areas where the 'highborn' rule, they have no water concerns. I'm disappointed they didn't have the dinner scene where the drippings from hand washing tubs were given to the poor, that scene really shows how important it is. The palm trees get mentioned briefly but that's not nearly as potent as the poor begging for damp washcloths.",qd6vqv
hho5uqn,"when you read the book you feel thirsty because they explain it so damn well and in detail. The movie didn't do it justice because how can you? It's not an 'interesting' part. 

Remember the palm trees? Well it's all reversed in the book —people look at them with *hatred* because they drink as much water as 100 people. Water is scarce and water is the currency, people pay each other with water, they take dead people's 'water'. It's a desert, there's not a lot of places to get more water. The aren't any rains, there aren't any rivers. All they have for water supply is morning dew. And even the best stilsuit loses (I believe) 500g of your water daily, which you have to get somewhere or you'll die. 

In the book Paul and Jessica have a bag of water with them in the desert, 1 litre, and it's a treasure so big they almost had a fight over it and saved someone's life with it.",qd6vqv
hhmjdai,For a theme so much about water they didn’t show a single scene (afaik) about someone being thirsty or affected by the lack of it. Little slapdash with the anchoring IMHO,qd6vqv
hhy4fzz,The desert rat was your best example of water being scarce in the movie.,qd6vqv
hhp2ec7,Theres a suit that recycles sweat so you can drink it. People are drinking ball sweat,qd6vqv
hhph8n5,"In Part 1 of the film, only Duncan has been with the Fremen. We have yet to see the Fremen culture or their sietches. The cave complex in the latter part of the film was an older imperial terraforming complex that was abandoned due to spice production.",qd6vqv
hhtny27,"The lack of water in the book feels fitting for a book, but incessant for a movie. I think the movie did a fair job. They seriously never shut the fuck up about it in the book, which fits, but do you really want that on screen?",qd6vqv
hhvncx9,"They didn't really put as much emphasis on the lack of water as they could have. There was a fair bit of crying, even from Kynes, which seemed a bit strange. 

They also mentioned how the suit recycles their sweat and tears, but they didn't mention how it also recycles *all* of the other bodily fluids.",qd6vqv
hi05vzc,"If water is so important that people wear specialized suits to save every possible drop, why is most of their face exposed?

I get that this shows the performance, but in world logic it's non-sensical.",qd6vqv
hhlilu4,"Yeah, that's because movie wasted a lot of time on pretty shots instead of developing it's ideas and showing importance of things that are going on",qd6vqv
hhl9avc,i guess access to water just isn’t generally represented in movies so the lack of it is hard to notice maybe. it’s really drilled in to you when you read the book though.,qd6vqv
hhof9dm,Especially since Paul comes from a planet with a lot of water. At the end of the movie where he kills Jamis the book takes a different turn instead of just getting rid of the body.  in the book they have a water conservation funeral and Paul speaks. He begins to cry and in fremen culture giving water to the dead is a really big deal and it’s seen as a gift. They respect him more for it and it made lady Jessica realize how important water is to culture and how it shapes it. The fact that Paul chooses the name of muadib which is the desert rat that conserves water adds to him being this you know prophet.,qd6vqv
hhogril,Was the plot easy to grasp with out reading the book?  I've never read the book and wonder if I would enjoy it.,qd6vqv
hhss11m,It bugged me that there were so many scenes of characters (even Fremen) walking around in the open desert with their still suit masks off. Seems like a dangerous waste of water,qd6vqv
hi5kxq5,If I recall there’s a scene in the book where Paul discovers a massive greenhouse full of plants and it’s a gross misuse of water knowing how scarce it is for the Fremen.,qd6vqv
hlv8wc3,"Agreed. My buddy and I just saw this tonight, and are both book readers. There were just so many instances of missed opportunities to show the world. The water was just not shown to the same importance. I'm not an expert, but I feel like if I hadn't read the books I wouldn't understand the dire need for water preservation, and what a Mental was, and who Kynes was and that Atreides were on Arrakis for more than 24 minutes before the Harkonnen invasion.",qd6vqv

That bull head? As a child he watched it kill the one man who showed him compassion, he dedicated his life to protecting that man's family.

We missed a scene of his drunken accusations that ( things Yueh had been doing ) was Jessica.",qd6vqv

hhodqol,"I respect your opinion, but I thought he was horribly miscast.  He pulled me out of the movie every time he spoke.",qd6vqv
hhmf4c9,"Yeah, I think that was the best acting I saw from him (actually, thinking about it now, Game of Thrones might be that). It was Mamoa, but toned down and kinda more realistic, like I really bought his big brother relationship with Paul, and when he >!sacrificed himself in his final scene, he didn't say a word and just did the Atredies salute, knowing what he had to do.!<",qd6vqv
hhkxz3o,He’s the only one who tried tried to instill some humor and fun in his lines.  Everyone else was pretty somber.,qd6vqv

hhl42e3,My only complaint is he looks a bit strange without facial hair lol,qd6vqv
hhmqxrr,Duncan Idaho was one of my least favorite characters in the book but he was one of the standouts in this movie. I love what Denis Villenueve and Jason Momoa did with the character,qd6vqv
hhnep0q,"I disagree, I thought he was the only one here who wasn't perfectly cast. Kind of just seemed like jason momoa was in Dune instead of another character",qd6vqv
hhmjus2,It would be interesting to see how he does if they ever adapt God Emperor.,qd6vqv
hhmqsdf,"Same here! He was the perfect Duncan, I was blown away by his performance.",qd6vqv
hhnt84o,"This makes me wonder if things were cut out, the book has some interesting things about him that aren't show, I wonder if they are in the tank somewhere for an extended edition. (likely not.)

I do agree, he always seemed like a guy that just plays himself. He was the one of the cast I was most worried about, but he didn't stand out too much. So good job.",qd6vqv

hhkzpab,"a) The hunter-seeker seeks movement, so Paul stood as still as possible and tried to blend in with the hologram. It darted to the housekeeper since it immediately sensed her movement.  
 It was left there by House Harkonnen to kill Paul, yes (this was put in place before the Reverend Mother went to the Baron and told him Paul and Jessica were off-limits).     
b) Spot-on. There are lasguns in the books (pretty self-explanatory) that can penetrate shields... but in the process they cause a nuclear explosion that kills whomever fired the lasgun so yeah, melee only.   
c) Also spot-on. Bullets/anything too high-velocity are mostly useless against shields. It's only by getting up close and personal at the right speed can they be penetrated. The explanation being that shields are supposed to be calibrated to allow matter to pass through at certain speeds, so they can allow air molecules to pass through.",qd6vqv
hhksidz,"Hunter seekers are based on movement so it went for Mapes as she opened the door and he was able to catch it. There was a small scene that showed the harkonnen plant in the wall and Thufir and Leto have a conversation about it.

hhkpw7k,"a) I forget how that scene goes in the book, but in the movie the drone seemed to be confused by the hologram projection around Paul. And yeah, it was being controlled by a leftover Harkonnen agent.

b) Yeah, you’re right on that. Also in the book if you hit a shield with a laser-gun shot it can cause a chain reaction large enough to kill the shooter, so that is avoided. You briefly see that happen in the film when the Atreides fleet is attacked in the night.
c) Yeah, exactly.",qd6vqv
hhkxroo,"They lexplained the hunter seeker operator was buried in the walls six weeks before the harkonnens left the city 

They even showed his decaying corpse",qd6vqv
hhlmwgg,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhllmyc,"In order to levitate, the hunter-seeker uses a suspensor (an outgrowth of the same science that allows faster-than-light travel, shields and the Baron's floating suit). However, light traveling through such fields is deflected (which is why you can see the fields), so the relatively narrow camera on the tip delivers a highly distorted image that is also bereft of any depth-of-field. This makes it difficult to make out the target unless it moves (which is why Paul was standing very still and the hunter-seeker made a dash for the door when it opened).

In terms of swords, they didn't show (or explain) two factors. The first is that laser guns are simply better than standard small arms in every way but one: if a laser connects with a shield, there's a massive explosion that kills everyone in the vicinity. The slow pellet stunners aren't actually very effective weapons. While they can penetrate shields, they don't do much of anything once they've penetrated since they're moving too slowly to do any real damage. Moreover, if you see them being shot at you, you can simply step out of the way in the time it takes them to move through the shield.

In terms of the fighting style, the actual fighting style is extremely fast except for the last few inches. You want to get your blade into position while your opponent is both restrained and out-of-position with their own blade so you can make that last (slow) movement effectively. Doing this cinematically is difficult, so most filmed interpretations are done more to look good on film than attempt to match the mechanics necessary for such a fighting style.

In terms of his dreams, he doesn't have true prescience until he reaches Arrakis and is exposed to spice. Prior to this, his 'visions' are foggy so he can pick up small details but he's often mistaken about the overall truth. So when Villeneuve showed the dream where Jamis defeated Paul, he was breaking with the book. On the other hand, when he showed Idaho being killed, it was relatively true to how Paul's visions would have worked at that point.

That being said, Herbert tended to treat prescience as a plot device rather than a cohesive mythology. It worked the way he wanted it to work to make the narrative work.",qd6vqv
hhlklil,">Regarding the shields and fighting style: I noticed that the fighting style was quite slow and dance-like. Was it purposefully done this way as to show that slow, powerful and fluid movements can penetrate the shield that blocks anything that is high velocity?

Pretty much. The whole invention of shields meant a complete switch around for martial styles. Guns and bullets became useless as the only way to penetrate a shield was to move slow enough that it was not deemed lethal speed. So out came the knives and before they contacted the shield they had to slow down to pass through in order to kill.

They have laser guns in the universe as well but due to DUNE PHYSICS as soon as a laser touches a shield you end up with a nuclear explosion or something dramatic. It's pretty much a universal agreement to not use laser weapons as everyone important has shields as standard and nobody wants to blow up themselves and everyone nearby.",qd6vqv
hhl0uy6,Thank you. You just made the use of swords/knives better for me. I wonder if I would’ve picked up on it when I go to see it in theaters or not.,qd6vqv
hhlyhoz,"Hunter-seeker has a small camera, which is affected by antigrav unit, so it has a potato-quality image. It basically reacts to movement.",qd6vqv

hhlh7yu,"Yes you picked up on pretty much everything exactly as it was! That's so great to see the portrayal was good enough to convey all that with showing not telling.

You were correct about everything but the first and last I'll expand a bit. First bit, it's motion sensing which is why he freezes and slows down his heart and breath and it immediately darted when other movement occurred iirc.

Last part...they didn't show this as well. Paul's visions are really sort of like enhanced probability presience. He sees the outcomes if possible futures and timelines. Jamis behaving that way was unknown timeline to what was previously most probably and Paul saw, and when Paul started having visions of that timeline it like 99.9% ended in Jamis ganking him.",qd6vqv
hhoe532,"> The use of swords: My theory as a non-reader is that, since the development of the shields, ordinary bullets have become useless. Therefore, soldiers had to revert back to swords and melee weapons that can penetrate the shields. And then there are the expensive shield-drilling bullets that we saw. Is this correct?

This is the in-universe justificarion. The out-of-universe is that Herbert thought sword duels were cool.",qd6vqv
hhl48rz,"Regarding the shield-drilling bullets, they looked like hunter-seekers to me, I think they reused the visual as it's an established weapon we saw earlier, so it makes sense to viewers.

hhpeeiv,"* Nothing is automated, so he controlled the hunter-seeker all the way through.
* Yes
* Yes

hhll7wh,"1. From what I remember of that scene in the book, Paul hides kind of how he did in the movie and basically slowed down all movement and everything in his body. I think the drone operates on movement and life signs. The Bene Gesserit have the ability to control everything in their bodies, including what sex their child will be born as. Hence the line ""You were told to only produce daughters.""
2. From what I remember, shield technology is so advanced that shooting someone with a laser gun causes it to rebound and it's like a bomb goes off. It'll kill the shooter and pretty much spare the person with the shield or kill both. So guns are basically nonexistent by that point.
3. Exactly, it goes along with the advanced shield technology. You hit someone with a sword but you're attack is too fast, it just bounces off the shield. The weakness in the shield technology is it can't block slow movements. So you strike and at the last moment you slow down to penetrate the shield.
4. Yep, it's to make you question if Paul really is the One. Or really what is the One. Just because someone checks a lot of the boxes on some prophecy, you don't know if they're really the One. They could just be a special individual, who fate or whatever shined on. The book is all about making you question stuff like that.",qd6vqv
hhkti9n,"Regarding your first question: In the book, the hunter-seeker follows movement. It's why it went for Shadout Mapes when she opened the door.",qd6vqv
hhmo91v,"I am most of the way through the first book, so I am by no means an expert, but I will answer as best i can(Dune vets please feel free to expand/correct/elaborate). 

1. The hunter/seeker is movement based and semi controlled. Due to Paul's training, he was able to notice it and remain perfectly still or still enough to seem invisible to it. When Shadout Mapes(Fremen housekeeper) comes in, it thinks she is the target and moved to attack. You can kill the hunter-seekers by grabbing then and ramming/breaking their needle/front. From the book, i imagined it more snake like. 
* For this, fire arms/ranged weapons seem to be less popular due to the shielding technology. There are few things that can get through the shields, like those special bombs that were destroying the ships as well as that special dart Yueh used. 
* The reason the fighting looked dance like, is that they have to get close and then(from my understanding), slowly move the blade to penetrate the shield. The shields deflect fast moving things, so they have to get to the shield and then slowly move through it to get to their targets. This is also why at the end, Stillgar thought Paul was toying with Jamis. He was not accustomed to ever fighting without a shield so he kept fighting as if Jamis had a shield on(they was expanded on a good deal in the book). 

Thats a little bit of info that I hope helps!",qd6vqv
hhr1jnt,"You nailed the “prophecy” about Jamis. You have gathered that Paul can see many pathways in the future; in one, Jamis was a friend rather than an immediate foe.

In fact, during Jamis’s funeral (which I really hope to see in part 2) Paul claims he was his friend in an emotional moment.",qd6vqv

They're human operated and the suspensor field distorts the video feedback which is an explanation, but yeah the thing going up to and stopping right at his eye is pretty cheese, why would it stop exactly there? Basic sense is that if you even think you have a target follow through, the movie would have been much shorter :)",qd6vqv

As a little addition, the use of Atomics is heavily regulated. If I recall correctly if a noble house is found to have used an atomic then the the rest of the noble houses are duty bound to wipe them out. I think. I may need to read up on that bit.",qd6vqv

hhqhxjn,"The Hunter-Seeker (I thought should have been larger from the book description, but w/e). It doesn’t see well unless there is movement. So Paul was being as still as possible. Then when the Shadout Mapes walked in he acted and smashed it. There’s better scenery and imagery used in the book for that part. It was a Harkonnen assassin who was literally packed away for months waiting for the Atreides to show up. 

They use swords because of the projectiles inability to penetrate shields. They also have las-guns (which we saw a bit) but las-guns interact badly with shields. Think nuclear explosion almost. It’s intense. 

Yes, the shields are penetrated by a slower movement. So as they swing swords/blades into shields they have to slow down a little to get the blade past the barrier. The scene where he fights Jamis is really interesting in the book because Paul has trained his entire life to fight with a shield. So his movements slow down instinctually when he gets close to a killing strike. Also because he’s never killed someone before. But that drags the fight out longer in the book as well.",qd6vqv

hhsyr0h,"in teh book when paul fights jamis, its not just that he has not killed before, thats jessica's excuse when the fremen think paul is playing with Jamis, its that paul has always trained with shields, so every killing blow is timed to penetrate a shield so just misses killing Jamis because the fremen dont use shields (they attract worms).",qd6vqv

>* Regarding the shields and fighting style: I noticed that the fighting style was quite slow and dance-like. Was it purposefully done this way as to show that slow, powerful and fluid movements can penetrate the shield that blocks anything that is high velocity?

I swear, you're trolling us. You nailed it. The book explains it exactly like this. Bravo. God damn man, read the book. It's so good.",qd6vqv
hhu776g,"The sword and knife use is because of the heavy prevalence of shields in their world. Only things passing at just the right speed can enter a shield. The reason that they look like they're dancing is because like right before they enter the shield they have to move slow or the blade will bounce off. They don't really show it in the movie but the reason in the book that they ask if Paul is toying with jamis is because he's trained so precisely with a shield that his timing was off and he had trouble finishing jamis who was used to fighting with no shield. You also saw a lasgun it was that thing that cut through the massive door like it was butter. So they have ""laser guns"" that are super badass in the dune world but they don't see much use because if a lasgun hits a shield it causes a nuclear explosion. So they can't really use them in war because most people wear shields. in the book half the time you can't even tell when people are wearing shields. It has to catch the light right and you can see a faint shimmer. So by default back to swords and knives and poison.",qd6vqv

Hunter seekers are movement/vibration based as the camera in it is suppressed due to the suspesor field around it. In the book he is as still as a statue on his bed before he catches it as it zooms towards Shadat Maeps (sp)

Therefore, soldiers had to revert back to swords and melee weapons that can penetrate the shields. And then there are the expensive shield-drilling bullets that we saw. Is this correct?

Essentially. There were some liberties taken in the movies on this one but it really did a good job of building what a shield was and how it functioned. If an energy beam hit a Holtzman field (shield), it would result in sub-atomic fusion and a nuclear explosion.


>* Regarding the shields and fighting style: I noticed that the fighting style was quite slow and dance-like. Was it purposefully done this way as to show that slow, powerful and fluid movements can penetrate the shield that blocks anything that is high velocity?

I questioned this as well. In the books, the only effective combat method was the deft use and careful precision of a handheld daggers, if moved slowly enough. New styles of fencing and fighting were developed to take advantage of this one small vulnerability. It also seemed as though this was a thematic choice because it was a direct juxtaposition to the abject futurism of universe. The final fight scene (without shields) was much faster choreographed which lends credence to your theory.",qd6vqv

Also with all the damn reference to the desert mouse throughout the movie why not end with Paul choosing his Fremen name?! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!",qd6vqv
hhkx6le,"Honestly, I couldn’t disagree more. I enjoyed the movie a spectacle, and I know they can’t go exactly 1:1 with the book, but there were enough things missing that left me feeling disappointed. 

Mainly: Characters that got shafted. Liet, Yueh, the mentats, and to a certain but less impactful degree Shadout Mapes. 

-	Yueh is introduced what, once before his betrayal? Why not include the scene between him and Jessica before the assassination attempt on Paul? Make us invest in his character and the loss and hope for his wife, so we understand his motives before betraying Leto. Having him tell Leto why after Leto has been betrayed takes the wind out of those sales.
-	Liet. Liet’s character thrives on his/her ecological hope for Dune and the paradise it could be. Liet also needs to be won over. By removing the dinner party scene (what is it with movie adaptations and not having this scene?) we don’t get the exchange about terraforming Dune, and also the respect Liet developed when the Duke decides not to waste the water. The ecological stuff is super briefly alluded to in Paul’s film early on and then in the weather station, but to me the weight of water *and* what Dune could be is THE pillar of the book and missing from this film
-	Mentat’s. Is the word mentat said once in the film? Paul is a mentat for crying out loud! It’s not just his mother who made him what he is. Leto had a role in that too. I get that the movie and story can proceed without this, but it feels like a corner cut, and with the other two points I mentioned above, it lends to a greater sense of emptiness.
-	Shadout Mapes. Another small corner cut that I think lends to my general misgivings. She is just there to be chosen and give Jessica the Crysknife, then next she’s dead. She and Kynes both need to be observers to the Atreides and be the reader/viewers stand-in for the Fremen as they slowly realize who Paul is.

Overall, I think I’m just a fan of the first third of the book and think the exposition is what makes Dune so good. The 2.5 hours felt packed already. I think to get some of the above in you’d have to cut it at them escaping into the storm and Duncan dying, but I think it would provide a better foundation for part 2 instead of rushing through and leaving new viewers without important context. I don’t think the movie was necessarily bad, but I think these omissions harm the story going forward",qd6vqv
hhkwgrf,"seriously? I feel like they left out so many important plot lines. paul/jessica being a harkonnens was never mentioned, piter was not even in the movie, didn’t meet the barons nephews/learn about their plans for arrakis after taking control again, nothing mentioned about the mentat.",qd6vqv
hhlm9bn,"Arrakeen was actually the only thing I didn't like about it. It seemed too small and too brutalistic.

hhkxv34,"Oh man that one shot of Arakeen with the shield wall in the background looked SO similar to the picture I had in my head of the last battle. Also love how they incorporated some little details, like in the final fight scene between Paul and the fremen dude, how the fremen switches his knife to the other hand real quick before going for the final blow (and in the book Paul talks about how he was able to read that move). That's just the one I remember at the moment, but I remember being thoroughly impressed with all the small details they hit spot on.",qd6vqv
hhlgzof,"Define well-adapted. Lynch's movie isn't that great. The visuals are incredibly dated and bad, and the dialogue/monolog bits are weird.

But at 137 minutes, it's incredibly faithful to the novel. To the point that the book may as well have been the screenplay. Which is why the movie suffers so much. Because it crams a lot into that time. 

Villeneuve's Dune is almost the opposite, though. The visuals are amazing, the dialogue is more natural, and the pacing is great. But at 155 minutes, it tells less than half the story and still omits parts from that part of the story. 

Personally, I feel like there was too much omitted about Yueh and his character. To the point that his betrayal has no impact on the audience. He's just suddenly an anti-hero or something. Also wish this new Dune had included the dinner party. Lynch's Dune was incredibly rushed, but so was this one in some ways. It made it seem like they had just landed on Arrakis and were there for a day before getting killed. 

I enjoyed it because of the production value, but there were definitely parts to trim. Don't need to keep seeing expanding visions of the same parts. Could very easily truncate those.",qd6vqv

hhkzvyy,"I dunno I’m really on the fence. I don’t think it’s a bad film. I just think it’s very similar to Lynch’s film. This was not Frank Herbert’s Dune it’s Denis Villeneuve’s. He made some interesting choices. Arrakeen felt to metallic to me. It was missing the life they saw on the way to the palace from the books. The Atreides troops fell to fast. Seeing them in action not really a fan of Josh Brolins gurney. Just can’t see that take as a Bard. Jason Momoa as Duncan though worked a lot better then I thought he would. I can kinda see the few books down him actually being the guy for the ages. The dialogue was very stilted and oddly paced in the opening act. Shot beautifully though. Stephen McKinley Henderson’s Thufier needed more air time. Dug the way they showed the difference between him and Piter with the eyes doing different things when processing.

Not sure his edits to Paul though really work. He seemed so not present in the opening act. Like the volume was turned way down. The only person you really see paying loyalty was Duncan. The lack of people being impressed by him in general makes the changes on Arrakis less notable. And they didn’t finish scenes with him. Just so maddening.


Lastly I still didn’t get the dinner party scene. To me that’s always been where Paul really starts to show his leadership and statecraft. I knew it was a long shot but I wanted it.

Jessica being reduced to a blubbering crybaby in the movie.

Jamis fight happening almost immediately?? And then nothing about the ceremony for recovering his water after.

Gurney/Duncan/Yueh getting maybe 10 minutes of screen time. No baliset playing. No suspecting Jessica as the betrayor (so how are they going to explain Thufir ending up with the Harkonnens after this??)

Liet Kynes never talking about his/her dream for changing Arrakis.

No explanations from the Baron on how this will work in his favor, installing Rabban to squeeze Arrakis so down the line he can swap in Feyd Rautha.

Thufir Hawat appears in the film only to fail at discovering the hunter seeker and is never really seem again. Pitir de Vries also barely has an appearance, and his dialogue/planning for the overthrow of Atreides and installing Rabban is missing.

hhr4j9f,"I've posted this elsewhere but I don't get how book readers can think this movie was true to the books at all.

It left out so many crucial points, lacks explanations so my friends who hadn't read the books had no idea what the hell was going on. For example, gom jabbar scene, there is no explanation for what he feels is happening to his hand in the box, just acid trip/fever dream cuts to scenes of fire and desert which looked comically bad; the Baron needing suspensors because he is too fat to support his own weight (friend asked why this guy can fly, since movie never covers it); ALL dialogue from the Duke about his struggles, worries, strategy, his suspicions of Jessica on Arrakis: ALL dialogue between Jessica and the Duke about what was happening with their son, and their own relationship (the Duke's line in the movie ""I should have married you"" makes no sense as they have never once discussed the fact she was a concubine in the movie up until this point, and then never bring it up again).

Jessica being reduced to a blubbering crybaby in the movie.

Jamis fight happening almost immediately?? And then nothing about the ceremony for recovering his water after.

Gurney/Duncan/Yueh getting maybe 10 minutes of screen time.

Never showed the training dummy robot things in action.

Liet Kynes never talking about his/her dream for changing Arrakis.

No explanations from the Baron on how this will work in his favor, installing Rabban to squeeze Arrakis so down the line he can swap in Feyd Rautha.

Thufir Hawat appears in the film only to fail at discovering the hunter seeker and is never really seem again. Pitir de Vries also barely has an appearance, and his dialogue/planning for the overthrow of Atreides and installing Rabban is missing. No conversation between Thufir and Jessica leading him to suspect she is the one who will betray them - so how are they going to explain Thufir working for the Harkonnens later on?

There's probably a ton more but this is just off the top of my head.

Clunky ass dialogue throughout. Sometimes great acting, sometimes straight-to-DVD acting. Some moments were just so, so bad.

Cinematography was great though. They really should have done it as a miniseries instead, as the pacing was just so damn fast it feels like events are just happening one after the other with no connection between them.",qd6vqv

hhkm772,"It's not really possible for the film to adequately explain the reasons behind it, but if you've never read the book Jessica was essentially a concubine (the bene gesserit have a centuries long breeding program propagated by sending trained concubines such as Jessica to have children with the noble houses) but she was not a noble. The Duke fell in love with her, but never married her for the various political reasons tied up with her not being from a noble house and being a bene gesserit concubine.",qd6vqv

That moment is pivotal in his acceptance by the Fremen and is essentially where his messianic journey begins. Showing Paul cry and the Fremen in awe of it would have been a much better moment, in my opinion, for the movie to end on.

In all other aspects the movie was 10/10 for me. Incredible casting, visuals, score. Good performances. Brilliant screenplay adaptation that changed very little, but what it did change actually made it translate better from book to movie. So I gave it a 9 overall, because for me a 10 has to be perfect from start to finish and this was *almost* perfect.

hhl2a08,"They really undersold how pivotal a moment that fight was for Paul, psychologically speaking. 

It was very rushed, as compared to the book.  Book had more character development buildup from Jamis prior to the fight.",qd6vqv
hhkz3tw,"I was kinda disappointed by the Jamis scene. I thought the trip across the desert with him obviously wanting to kill them would have been good lead up to the duel and then a chance to show the water reclamation rituals. 

Also I wish they had gone a little lighter on the Paul mysticism. Him planning to marry the emperors daughter was years out of place.

Edit: also the shield fighting style when Paul is fighting Jamis and not landing killing blows.",qd6vqv
hhpcc4n,"That's literally my only issue.  The Jamis fight should have been a minute or two longer.  They have a couple of beats happen within like ten seconds of eachother, which isn't necessary in fight scenes.  Those beats should have been spread apart with the action resolving them - so the beats with Jamis are: they fight - Paul tries to get him to yield, everyone tells him it's to the death - Paul keeps trying to see if he'll yield - he doesn't - paul kills him.    


In the film this doesn't reaaaally work, because Paul's sudden change in decision isn't really hinted at.  It takes a steel, a coldness that we only see from him once.  Denis was trying to balance this coldness being a long dormant part of Paul and it coming up in the end, so what I think should have happened is that Paul SHOULD have continually tried to get Jamis to yield, to the increasing annoyance of the group, until Jamis uses Paul's mercy to harm him and raise the stakes.  But Paul doesn't increase his ferocity, while Jamis does - because Paul is not letting the pain make him angry.  Jamis simply escalates to the point where if Paul doesn't kill him, he dies - so Paul kills him.  I also think the fight was far too one-sided and Paul should have been on the backfoot UNTIL the moment when he grows cold and realizes killing is the only option.  


In the film, they seemingly wanted to avoid any emotional escalation because that would defeat the entire point of Paul's arc.  But they absolutely could have made the fight scene a little longer with genuine escalation of stakes beyond Jamis screaming for a few seconds.  I did like the scene, but it definitely was NOT a climactic sequence.  In order to be one, it would have to play out for longer and draw its beats out to be more dramatic so that Paul's first kill was a big, big fucking step in his growth.    


9/10 though.  Small nitpick that didn't really sour the experience overall, but definitely would have put it into 10/10 territory for me.  All Denis films have weird, unorthodox climaxes, but this one felt like it wasn't really intended to even be a climax.  I think that sits as a fault for now, until part 2 comes out.  Unless you watch these films back to back, part 1's ending just falls flat.",qd6vqv
hhkwkdk,"Yep if that was going to be the boss battle or final showdown of the movie it could have been done more dramatic or in a cool setting/arena it was very flat and easy and then puff the movie ends right there, they could have pulled a better high note to end the film.",qd6vqv
hhobnv0,"i thought the actual fight itself was badly executed (note*: not in terms of choreography).  like i get that Paul is supposed to be the larry stu of the first book, but it completely flies in the face of chani's hype-man-style buildup on what a baller fighter Jamis in that he gets embarrassed 4 or so times by a kid.  it didnt even turn Paul's unwillingness to kill to be a disadvantage for him, just let him school on the guy for a few more times before the killshot.  but it was pretty rushed, and i think by that point they just wanted to close out the movie",qd6vqv
hhlbell,">The build up to Jamis fight could’ve been better.

There wasn't a build-up to the Jamis since it's not the climax of the book. It is important to the real climax of Dune though, which you'll see in part 2.

Villeneuve just needed a place to stop and he decided it was after Paul's fight with Jamis. 

That's why the ending felt unsatisfying.",qd6vqv

I'd have the volume at 50 (not an exaggeration) for dialogue I felt like the characters were mumble-whispering and then I'd have to frantically button down to 15 for some huge explosion or *blaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr* bass drop.

Movie started in the middle of a conflict which wasn't really fleshed out enough. Introduced a lot of characters with almost everyone of them dead by the end  with no development, which is fine but I didn't  know enough about them to care. 

 Wish they would have went into more of what exactly the voice power thing is, has similarities to the force from star wars for me in a way but the introduction and mystery surrounding the force played out better. Seems like it will be an integral part of Paul's rise to power and I wish they went into more detail about it. 

 Paul's acting felt emotionless to me as well although maybe that's intentional? I thought the rest of the cast had good performances. 

The action scenes and cinematography was excellent.  Set designs, outfits everything I think they nailed. It definitely set up an intriguing world that I'd be interesting in seeing more of, but by the time the next part comes out I doubt I'll even remember much of it. 

Having said all that, I can easily see how people that are already invested in the dune universe would absolutely love this move. I imagine they did a fantastic job of converting the source material visually, and book readers wouldn't really have any questions about storylines that are playing out.

Honestly I think they thread the needle pretty well between having enough exposition to clue in people who are new to the series while not completely boring those who know the source material.

I can’t fault the sound, visuals, etc. but I found the whole thing a big yawn. The dialogue seemed to be just about all exposition, even when it didn’t need to be (e.g. “He’s locked the door!”).

My friend told me it’s because they had to streamline a lot but also because the movie seems more interesting in the religious aspects. We agreed that those also feel a bit lacking without the second half. At this moment it has a very typical heroes journey at its centre without the subversions of the rest of the book. On its own I generally found it very portentous and while all it’s themes and arcs remain dangling and incomplete, doesn’t lend itself easily to recommend to non sci fi fans. I told my book reading friend it felt like watching the first four episodes of GOT’s. But if you took out any of the down to earth elements, the complexities that characters like Littlefinger, Varys and Tyrion bring to the table, or the likability of Jon Snow as the future messiah figure (the end especially felt like Paul’s arc didn’t really hold up to closer inspection). 

I know it’s unfair to compare, it’s just what I was thinking of at the time. I also thought of John Carter, which also struggled to solve the issue, how do you tell a story that has been copied so often, it’s iconic elements already feel cliched? How do you make it fresh? I think Dune doesn’t fail entirely here but it doesn’t fully succeed, especially in its half form.",qd6vqv

hhm0xnw,"I watched it last night with a friend of mine and neither of us had read the book or knew a ton going in. We were actually planning on watching a different movie but saw it was on HBOMax and decided to give it a shot. 

At the end of the movie, I left wanting to read the book but that was largely motivated by my frustration about not knowing what was going on. For the same reason my friend left not wanting to read the book at all. 


1. Both of us were confused for much of the movie. Like I understood the basic plot but was lost about what anyone’s motivation or backstory was. It was visually stunning but it was really hard to stay engaged for the last half because it felt like a lot of action, but little information about the underlying politics and emotion. 

2. As someone who hasn’t read the book I would love more of an explanation about why 8,000 years in the future, on a different planet there is still a society where people with light skin from cold climates rule over people with dark skin from warm climates. At times I thought it was meant to be an explicit commentary on colonialism (especially because they’re all desperate for “spice”) but at other points it seemed like a coincidence? I’m curious if the way race was handled in the film was pulled from the books or if it was something the filmmakers did to give the audience an easy shorthand. 

3. Similarly, I’m a bit lost as to why a society 8,000 years in the future seems so regressive with things like traditional aristocracy + what seems like relatively rigid gender roles. It’s not that I don’t believe that it’s possible but I’m again wondering if there’s context from the books I’m missing.

And while Maclachlan gave the character a certain charm just with his Kyle Maclachlan-ness, Chalemet goes for a more subdued and sullen Paul who feels a bit harder to root for. I do like that we get a bit more of a sense of Paul not *wanting* his destiny during the tent scene, but we dont get to explore those feelings enough in this half of the film for it to really sell me on the character.

I don't know, I like all the space politics stuff and different cultures, ultimately I think I found this version cool-looking yet yawn-inducing",qd6vqv

I'm mostly confused about the motivations and the political landscape here. So the emperor felt threatened by House Atreides for some reason and so he sent them to Dune just to double cross them? The Bene Jeserwitchs are pulling the strings? Who's backing the Harkonens?

Also why did the Baron survive what appeared to be a very powerful poison that killed a whole room instantly? I expected him to at least be badly scarred or something, but no. Had a goo bath and he's good to go.

I'm so glad I did. This movie was literally made for big screen and cinema sound, my screening was in 3d, so I was really immersed and blown away by a combination of visuals and sound. There's NO way I'd be so impressed if I watched it at home. The movie didn't bother to explain many things, but only after watching a long YouTube video providing context I realized how many things were kinda shown but not spoken about/explained in the movie, so I really had no way of knowing such details.

Dude just doesn't miss.  Sadly this is my least favorite of his films.  On a technical level, this is a masterpiece but that's to be expected from the guy that did BR2049.  Denis Dune is more easily digestible I guess, compared to 1984 Dune.  But still, the core of the story just doesn't interest me that much.  As a non book reader I feel like there's a ton more going on in this world and a bunch gets glossed over.  I'm not given enough to care about any of these characters or care about what's happening.

Not a bad thing at all for me, but it absolutely could piss a lot of people off in theaters.  Lot's of ""wait, what's happening?"" in the first half.  By the second half it slows just enough to follow pretty much perfectly.    


The film is great, and there's two factors that I think will make this stick in people's heads until the next one is made.  

1. You can FEEL that Paul is doomed to become something almost not human. It's really weird how they built it up, but every decision Paul makes to be the thing everyone tells him to be is treated like a bunch of tragedy covered chess pieces moving into place for part 2.   It gives off a super distinct vibe and I recon that dissonance between the heroes journey and what the film is suggesting Paul is in for is going to really, really hook a lot of people.  The ""this is what you're meant for"" narrative being shown to be... not what it usually is.  Something people have been wanting for a long time, and The Matrix sequels didn't cut it.  
2. You come away from this movie with a distinct feeling.  Almost like you watched a documentary.  It's so fucking perfect in presentation that even if you don't fully remember the plot, the feelings it gave you from the visuals alone will stick with you.  I absolutely adored the use of completely blown out highlights in the desert.  Where lesser movies would turn everything into a sickly yellow hue, this film went ""desert heat go brrr"" and assaulted all of our eyes with blinding whites.  Absolutely genius - it sets the film so far apart from every other film that could ever be compared to it.  I've found that, in the past, films don't even have to be that good to gain a following.  They just have to have a feeling that sticks with you.  Watchmen.  Zombieland.  Tron Legacy. Some can be great and leave you with a feeling.  Midsommar.  Uncut Gems.  Spirited Away. This film is great, AND it has a feeling that doesn't leave you.  That lends itself well to conversation about great movies people have seen, and will ensure love of this film spreads greatly through word of mouth.

hhmpy9g,"This film gave me an intense understanding of why Star Wars used the Crawl. The first 45 minutes accomplished about 90 seconds worth of worldbuilding.

In general, I felt every. single. second. of the film.

It also made me think about something I read about the Foundation adaptation... they decided to have the Cleon clones to make it seem like more than a generic galactic empire story. And Foundation has the advantage of the Empire's sort of being the good guys. Dune just seems like Star Wars but the Force works differently (not its fault, the book was written first). However, it also reminded me of Avatar (ATLA).

At the same time, I'm not really sure there's a way to ""fix"" Dune so that it suits my sensibilities more. I read the Wikipedia summaries of everything that happens and I don't understand why these books are popular, *at all.* Nevertheless, I will try. 

I guess the way to start would be to make Duncan Paul's uncle. We'd start, therefore, with a young Paul, hearing a conversation between his father and uncle. This would take place just after the Atreides are given Dune. The key thing here is that the Atreides are only given enough Spice by the Emperor to allow a small detachment to travel quickly. By the time the Duke arrives, Paul will be old enough to be played by Chalamet. In any case, this odd decision by the Emperor can be the subject of an argument between the two brothers.

So, now, in a single scene we establish the significance of spice, the Emperor's scheme, the rivalry between the Harkonnens and Atreides (which was terribly set up in the actual movie) and we can even squeeze in the idea that the Emperor lacks sons. The Duke can reach the conclusion that the Emperor didn't give them enough spice since so that the Atreides aren't in a position to convince the Landsraad that Paul should marry the Emperor's daughter. (Since they have to spend all this time travelling.)

The movie now proceeds by following Duncan's perspective learning about Dune and Paul's education en route. I suggest that we see Duncan's adventures through the guise of Paul's visions. The handover ceremony now takes place on Dune, the Reverend Mother or whatever her name is does the test on Dune.

And I think after this the movie can proceed as it actually did.",qd6vqv

hhldtni,"I had never read the book(s), only heard about characters and plot points. While it was obvious some details from the book came in the form of exposition, most felt organic to how characters would have learned about them. I thought the structure of a far-future empire and its nobilities was very believable, even though the Harkonnens felt a little needlessly evil at times. The psychic religion likely feels more integrated in the book, but I'd say that's my only hangup with it. The tech itself felt hard (i.e. believable) and fantastical without ever feeling mismatched. And the plot was easy to grasp, while having a cohesive structure, once the world and characters were established.

Overall I'm very interested in seeing Part 2 if/when it comes out, but I am worried that it was ""dumbed down"" from the original. If it wasn't, and was simply a little abridged, then that's even better.",qd6vqv

There certainly movies that have sound mixing issues, but I think there’s also an assumption on the part of the audience that *every single thing* uttered by characters on screen should be decipherable, and that’s not always the case. Sometimes it’s just important to know that people are yelling or speaking, and their dialogue is supposed to be atmospheric in the same way any other sound element is, as opposed to being at the forefront of our attention.",qd6vqv

hhl09ay,"I agree (almost) wholeheartedly with each of your points. Gorgeous film that captured the scope of Herbert’s world building. I don’t know if it quite captured the heart though. There were a variety of items that stood out to me. I know this is incredibly nitpicky, but some parts that resonated with me in the book were left out or distorted. And maybe that’s unavoidable a screen adaptation, I’ll cede that. But some of the things that I thought were kind of off:
- Paul’s thoughtful, serious demeanor was completely forgone. I didn’t love how he was always buddy buddy with Duncan Idaho. Then, he seems so timid around his mother and the woman who administered the Gom Jabbar. And his conversation about the signet ring with his father. Didn’t like that. They were never implied to be close, other than through their unconditional Atreides pride and love. know the book is about Paul’s growth, but I didn’t think he started his journey so unsteady/unsure.
- Baron Harkonnen is now a spooky ghost.
- Introduction of Rabban so early in the film. Just a play for Bautista.
- Loved the Mentat eye thing. Thought Thufir, Duncan, and Gurney were not the greatest casting choices.
- Paul gets his spice vision at the thopter worm rescue? Not where it happens in the book and not nearly as informative or powerful.
- Shadout Mapes was such a bigger character in my mind. She was awesome. They threw the crysknife scene in and then she’s nothing. Why?
- What about the scene where Jessica discovers the greenhouse??? I liked that one.
- No talk of a traitor at all before Leto’s murder. Maybe that would be hard to convey but it’s pretty prominent in the book.
- Sardaukar are fucking sick.
- I think the pacing was bad. Character intros and big scenes happened far too close together. Scenes felt too abrupt and there was some random stuff that felt intrusive (Sardaukar legions first look with Piter).
- Cinematography and FEEL we’re great. These were just thinks I was thinking about. Now that I write them out, there’s probably no way they could have done a lot of these and have it hit traditional tropes for a larger audience (or even just transitioned to the screen in general). No one’s ever gonna be completely happy with an adaptation. It was a good, fun, visually stunning film.",qd6vqv

It feels like a movie that never got to its 3rd act. Which obviously is why there needs to be a part 2. So it would be a perfect start to a 2-part movie if part 2 was right around the corner... but its clearly not. The last hour of this film doesnt work as something to keep you satisfied until part 2 presumably releases in 2-4 years. 

LOTR got it right by shooting all 3 parts at the same time because the Fellowship of the Ring would have suffered the same way if it had left off where it did and asked you to wait another 2-4 years to continue. So to me a lot of the blame lands on Warner media for not seeing this coming & having faith in it as 2 movies, making sure the 2nd part wasn't going to be too far from part 1.

If Warner was smart they would clear the air, make a public statement, and say outright there will be a part 2 as soon as possible. Because to me that is the only way to calm the anti-hype that resulted from the way it ended.",qd6vqv

The most important thing about spice though is that it allows for space travel. There are Guild Navigators and they have taken so much spice to the point where they are deformed, and can find a safe path of travel when going at faster than light speeds due to the prescience
2. It's really fucking dry and hot. One of my minor complaints is that the movie didn't seem to have an emphasis on conserving water. How I imagined it was every time you are outside in the sun you have to be wearing a stillsuit to conserve as much water as you can.  
3. The Fremen as you said are better fighters than the Sardaukar. But Paul is the chosen one and I want to say that his prescience does play into him beating Jamis but I could be wrong on that. Also Paul was trained by both Gurney and Duncan and are seen as some of the best fighters in the universe. 

These weren't outright explained but I think 1 and 3 can be expanded on in the sequel. I hope that 2 is also made a point of focus in the next movie as they will spend all of the time in the desert. No more just walking around without a face covering in scenes.",qd6vqv

Personally, I don't agree about Duncan. I think his story is quite fleshed out, which was necessary for them to do in the first movie seeing as he dies. The other characters will have more screen time in the second movie to flesh out their stories.

>!I don't think you should be so quick to assume Rabban will play some merged role between Rabban and Feyd. I think it's perfectly fine that Feyd is not in the first movie. He plays a pivotal role later, and he can be introduced with Thufir. If he was in the first movie, it could have been too much for viewers to keep track of. This way you can introduce him and perhaps show him in the arena scenes, to draw people in quickly.!<

hhorsxf,"I agree overall with your take, and weirdly enough, it's giving me some hope for a TV show coming out based on the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. It's my favorite book series (also draws some elements from Dune itself) and with how horrible Hollywood generally is with adaptations, my initial reaction was that Amazon (who's producing this) will find some way to fuck it up. It's also a very dense, detailed, plot with loads of characters. However, if Dune could get a fairly faithful and well done first half in 2.5 hours, I kinda have more faith that the same can be done for WoT over the course of multiple seasons.

It honestly all comes down to how big a fan of the series the writers/directors are. Are they truly wanting to keep the heart of the story that made it beloved by millions? Or are they just trying to fill the ""medieval dark fantasy"" void left behind when GoT finished? THAT'S the big question.",qd6vqv

I think this is the best adaptation we’ve gotten so far (though I am a little partial to the miniseries) but there’s just so much in the book that I still believe the only way to really do Dune justice would be a proper tv series. I kind of wish they chose the ending point of the movie earlier like right after the attack on arrakeen and instead included more stuff on the lead up to the attack.

The pacing at times really was too dragged out, too much slow-mo, it almost felt like the movie tried very hard to impress you visually more than script-wise.

Fellow book reader, Lynch got a lot of things right (esp the worms and worm riding) but it definitely didn’t have the run time to nail everything.

You can tell that this really needs 6-ish hours to hit all the marks and the back ground exposition (did they even utter Piter’s name once? Or explain the mentats?), but two three hour movies are a hard sell.

Judging by this thread, that’s like 80% of comments. I came to complain about the lack of depth and the pace only to find everyone had already done that.

> This is an impeccably cast film.

>  It is almost uncanny how pitch-perfectly Chalamet combines arrogance, fresh-faced naivete, a sense of overwhelming duty, and a growing-rage at a prophesized destiny that he doesn't embrace.

100% Agree. I read elsewhere that the book's Jessica is much more stoic than how Ferguson plays her but I like that choice. Her showing deep emotional worry for her son really helped us non-book readers feel the gravitas of Paul's situation I think.

> There is a moment of Nolan-style sound editing when Paul and Jessica are in a sealed tent that is really, really unfortunate

Also 100% agree. Kinda an infuriating editing choice that appears more than once in the movie. With a story as huge as Dune, as a director you've GOT to make sure this moment is clearly communicated. I missed this and had to rewind it to catch it.

> ...a scene that should crackle with vital, in-the-moment human energy feels ""stagey."" This issue crops up most often when he's depicting small-scale combat.

Hit the nail on the head with this. I was looking for words for how to describe how those scenes played out for me and I think this is it, (although I'd argue Duncan's scene in particular was pretty horrible for more reasons than this.) I also felt the disconnect with Paul's fight against Jamis. Not a movie-ruiner for sure but definitely odd.

One thing you didn't mention was the whole deal about space travel in Dune's world being absurdly expensive, and the idea of a warship fleet arriving simultaneously on a planet would've been unheard of. I didn't know this, the movie didn't explain it at any moment prior to or during the attack... a passing mention by the Baron of the attack's expense in his final scene of the movie is like 1.5 hours too late. It's the whole reason I visited this reddit thread, just looking for some explanation on why the heck house atreides was so weirdly unprepared for the attack. Leto is hinting at it all movie, the sense of doom has been building with seemingly every character aware, and then within 5 minutes of screentime everything collapses.

The lack of explanation for missing computers/AI is possibly a loss tho I honestly didn't need that explained to enjoy the world. But entirely avoiding explaining why the climax of the film (the attack) was the way it was is just inexcusible, and easily avoidable I feel.

While, of course, such a vision of the future is one that almost any sane man would embrace, Paul in that scene is very obviously conflicted about this putative destiny

For Nolan films, for example, that play around a lot with sound, you'd ruin the effect the director wanted in their film if you just volume balance and push it out.

Something the movie doesn't emphasise is that it's expensive travelling across the galaxy. Like, REALLY expensive. Anyone in the galaxy who wants to use faster than light travel has to pay the Spacing Guild to facilitate the journey (since they have a monopoly on long distance space travel). Paying them to transport half a dozen ships costs a fortune even for rich nobles.
The fact that the Harkonnen were able to pay the spacing guild to transport a whole fleet of ships was unimaginable, it's the equivalent of someone on earth buying ownership of every country and landmass in the world. This unbelievable sight is only hinted on by Gurney Halleck running out during the attack and seeing the fleet drop down from the Spacing Guild ship up in the upper atmosphere of space, and he says ""oh my god"" or something like that. People only express themselves in that way when they see something unbelievable. The other hint, is that after the attack when the Baron is in the black tub of healing tar, the Baron says something like ""you have no idea what it cost to get out fleet here"", and he says all he cares about now is ""income"". In the books he mentions in detail how paying the spacing guild made him get into many decades worth of debt.

Most of the standing army was asleep, while the perimeter guards were still awake (as shown by one of the guards who woke up Gurney Halleck).

hhl3ltj,"As a newcomer to Dune, I think I followed everything really well. I never felt that I was missing things while watching the movie or thinking back over it. Everything made sense and I could follow the action and character motivations. 

I think the movie does a good job laying out the basics and asking you (the viewer) to fill in the details. I don’t need to know all the super detailed lore (apparently Paul is supposed to have a calculator augmentation or something?), I just need to know that Paul is a Duke who has visions of possible futures and is out to seek revenge on the people who killed his family. 

For example, after seeing the movie, I thought that Spice was literally used as fuel. It was only after reading this thread that I learned that spice is needed so that humans can see into the future and navigate their starships. Cool detail, but at the end of the day that doesn’t matter to my understanding. What matters is that spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and the movie lays that out plain and simple. 

Hopefully that gives you an idea of how a non-book reader would experience this film. Needless to say, I’m hooked. I truly believe this is one of the greatest movies I’ve ever seen.",qd6vqv
hhl2cip,I was so confused man,qd6vqv

hhl1eec,"I thought it was fine. I don’t need everything explained in big exposition dumps, that’s the problem with sci-fi movies these days. The bit of mystery and filling in the blanks with your imagination is what makes sci-fi great, and leaves you wanting more. I will definitely be ready the books now.",qd6vqv
hhldkom,"I honestly think most of the people replying to you are too embarrassed to admit what they didn't follow. The ""visions"" were jarring and disorienting, in the sense that I have *no idea* what Paul actually took away from them. Apparently, his visions of his fight with the Jamis guy showed him what moves the guy would use and helped  him win? But all we really saw of the fight in visions was some very quick shots of a couple things, and Paul looks so nauseated every time he has one that it doesn't seem like it actually would stick with him.

Zendaya's character shows up in a million and one visions, but we don't really get to meet her and we don't know anything else about her, so every time she appears, it's just like... ""alright, that's Zendaya, yep.""

Oddly enough, the easiest thing to follow was the politics and world building. Only point of some confusion was the houses thing, which isn't a confusing concept, but they keep talking about it like there are a ton of houses and yet I didn't get any sort of scale of how many there are vs the Imperial armies or whatever.

And there was a lot in there that *was* explained, but I'm sorry, I wasn't hanging on every single word coming out of everyone's mouth, so for example, I didn't catch Josh Brolin's line  about like the slow blade getting through the shield or whatever, and so the shields themselves kinda confused me the whole way through.

hhoz4an,"> Is the characterization better?

So, yes and no.  Characterization will undoubtedly be better in the second half just by the nature of the book (the Fremen are just really interesting in general, and we'll get a lot more about Paul and the way he feels about everything), but also, the mains characters are largely the result of millennia breeding and eugenics practices, who are also royalty--none of that leads to expressing tons of emotions.

Even so, we still got a bit of that:  Jessica when alone, Paul in the tent, Leto and Paul in the cemetery, etc.",qd6vqv
hhp0445,"Characterisation follows same beats and same progression but have much more time and scenes to develop, so everyone is more fleshed out. Movie trimmed a lot of it to cram the plot into a runtime, honestly, in a miraculous fashion.

It's definitely not a Snyder Justice League cut kind of movie where you're sitting there thinking it could be half as long the whole time, but I sure think it would have benefitted from more going on.

I know reddit has hyped the hell out of this movie and most should be very happy with it. Not saying it was a bad movie at all, but I feel like if this was some other new IP people would complain more. I am EXTREMELY CURIOUS if anyone was a little annoyed at the ""woman wailing music"" that came up like three or four times when he was having his visions/dreams. That shit was 100% just like Wonder Woman '84. Completely jarring for what should be more ethereal scenes.

But besides that, as Zendaya says in the opening monologue, the Harkkonens ruled with an iron fist, and were for all intents and purposes slave drivers--slave masters typically don't permit their slaves to decorate their living places in that way, and the Fremen fear the Duke will be the same way when he first arrives.",qd6vqv

What reason was there for her to be in a hurry. She went out of her way to muck with the process so that the one could be hers, but why would it need to be hers for any reason other than her own ego, vanity, and selfishness. Perhapsthe fact that she mucked with the process contributed to the One coming forth in such a way, which lead their mesianic rise to play out in a way that was not planned.

Why didn’t the Fremen guy directly challenge Lady Jessica to fight instead of asking for her to put forth some sort of representative like in Game of Thrones?

So, the movie doesn't explain this much (and they may honestly be waiting for part 2 to explain it), but Jamis challenges Jessica insofar as he believes she's a fraud--if he kills Paul, then Jessica dies as well.

I play a lot of D&D, and I’ve always been taught that a good plot hook has three major components. You start with the exposition/world building: what’s the setting, who are the major actors, stuff like that. This is the first hour and a half, two hours of the movie. 

Next, you have an inviting incident. Something happens to set the need for a quest off, usually some kind of fight (whether just a brawl or an all out war) breaking out. Just something big that happens to set off the conflict. In this case, Dune is invaded, lots of people die, and our hero goes into exile. 

Finally, you have the call to action. The characters have to decide to go on the quest and solve the conflict presented in the introduction. I.e. they’re not going to run, but they’re going to start a rebellion and overthrow their conquerors with “Desert Power.”

And *then* you go on the adventure and resolve the conflict. But instead, Dune just ends on the call to action. “We’re going to start the quest now, and roll credits.” If I was running this as a campaign, all of this would probably be in session one. IMO, movies should be self contained stories, with their own beginning, middles, and ends, which can contribute to an over-arching plot (part 1 and 2), but each part should have its own conflict and resolution. 

I’m sure it’ll be amazing when the full story is actually complete. It was a pretty solid beginning. But making a full movie out of just the beginning of a story leaves me wanting. A lot.",qd6vqv

hhmfups,"A book reader's explanation, not all of this is explained in the movie. This will a bit of a ramble. A good amount of the details I will discuss I am remembering from recently watching two videos from someone who previously worked on the Dune RPG. You can watch those here, they will fill in some of the details: [About the Bene Gesserit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjC5JLNFczY) and about [the goals of the Fremen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvErbQv_340)

The movie takes place in the far future, about 21,000 AD in our year counting (The movie shows 10,000 something, but that is not our years but rather since the founding of the spacing guild).

Humanity is seperated across a vast amount of planets. Society has regressed to being highly feudalistic, with most day to day power being relegated to noble families that each have their own fief. Above them all is the Emperor. Additionally you have the Spacing Guild as a powerful player, as they are the only ones with access to the training and technology that is required to travel through space quickly and safely. There is also the order of the Bene Gesserit (Word corruption of ""Good Jesuits""), nominally a sort of boarding school for girls that teaches them many special skills, making them desirable as advisors but also with their own agenda.

At the heart of the conflict of this first movie is the Emperor, the Atreides family and the Harkonnen family. These two families represent a threat to the Emperor's rule. The Atreides are well liked by the other noble houses and could be the spearpoint for a movement to overthrow the Emperor's disliked rule. The Harkonnen have governed the planet Arrakis (Dune) for over 80 years now, becoming obscenely wealthy to rival the wealth of the Emperor. Arrakis is rich in a food additive simply called 'Spice'. Spice gives long lasting live and other health benefits to any normal consumer, but if taken in high doses can also give great mental abilities that the Empire relies on, chiefly it allows the Navigators of the Spacing Guild to kind of see into the future when conducting faster than light travel and avoid any accidents.

To resolve this issue of two strong houses, the Emperor comes up with political move to play them against each other. The Atreides and Harkonnen have something of a rivalry, a blood feud going on. By Imperial decree he removes the Harkonnen as governors of Arrakis, with the excuse of them being unable to deal with the natives there. Instead he places Atreides in charge of the planet, to bring peace and take over the Spice trade. What he actually wants to do is upset the Harkonnen and move Atreides away from their base of power of their own home planet. What you see in the movie then is how the Emperor helps the Harkonnen to destroy the Atreides at Arrakis by loaning them some of his elite soldiers. With this he eliminates one house that threatens him, and makes the other expend a great amount of resources in the effort, weakening them. The Harkonnen in return get to become the governors of Arrakis again, to start making money again.

That's one part of the story, the political side a lot of the first movie deals with, now lets move onto the other side of Paul, the Bene Gesserit and the Fremen.

The movie doesn't really show this, but the Bene Gesserit have a special skill that allows them to speak to any of their female ancestors, something they find very useful. For some reason or other I can't remember, men are unable to do this out of the box. What the Bene Gesserit are doing behind the scenes is running a massive genetics operation. For thousands of years they have been sending their members to families to cross bloodlines and genetics in such a way that they believe will produce a man that can also use this ability. They nickname this person the Kwisatz Haderach (the writer of the book really liked foreign words for his work). By the start of the movie they have come very close to achieving this Kwisatz Haderach they believe, just one generation away. Lady Jessica is sent to advise (and seduce) Duke Leto Atreides and is told to bear daughters from him, daughters that can then go and have children that will produce the KH (Incidentally, Bene Gesserit also have the ability to choose the sex of their child). But Lady Jessica falls in love with Duke Leto, and when he asks her to conceive a son for him she does, betraying the orders from her superiors in the Bene Gesserit. This son is Paul.

Since they were very close to being able to birth the Kwisatz Haderach for sure, there is a lot of suspicion among the Gesserits that Paul could already be the one they're looking for, they just don't know. When Paul begins kind of seeing the future (also one of the KH abilities they were aiming for, one that can be triggered by Spice consumption), they become more sure. That's why at the beginning of the film the Mother Superior comes to interrogate Paul and test if he can control himself (and by extension his powers). So Paul is the heir of the Atreides, but at the same time is likely the final result of this millenia long effort by the Bene Gesserit (Referred to in the movie as having more than one birthright).

The other thing that's going on in the movie is Paul and Jessica's relation to the Fremen. You'll recall that when they first arrive on Arrakis, the native Fremen refer to them as the Lisan Al'Gaib as well as a lot of other religious references to them being the one in some sense or the other. But this isn't by some religious miracle or coincidence.

What has actually happened many years / generations in advance is the influence of previous Bene Gesserit. Back before space travel was fast and safe, humanity was still colonising the galaxy, but in a slower and more dangerous fashion, with little contact from one planet to another. The Bene Gesserit already existed then, and they had the foresight that eventually technology would reconnect these planets and allow Bene Gesserit and others to travel around more. So what the Bene Gesserit did is they send hundreds of their members around the galaxy in these early waves of colonisation and planted religious stories and symbolism around the galaxy, traditions that have survived until the time of the movie. These traditions they laid down ensure that whenever a Bene Gesserit arrives on a planet, they can hook into whatever traditions have been planted on the planet to gain the help of the natives (which they are taught in their training, there are a set amount). This is why in the movie when Lady Jessica selects Shadout Mapes as steward of their house, she remarks that Lady Jessica speaks the ancient tongues (that previous Bene Gesserit used to plant traditions). It is also why at the end, when the Fremen want to kill Jessica, they gain new respect for her after the fight and give her status, because they recognise her as a 'Sayyadina' or 'Wyrding Woman', which are their cultural references to these ancient previous Bene Gesserit.

So Paul inferred he was going to befriend and be mentored by this man, because that's what he was seeing, but that's not what the vision meant.

Right at the start the Bene Gesserit asks him if his dreams come true, and he replies 'not exactly'. That's what he means - the visions can be literal, but they can also be metaphorical - he doesn't know what they mean until they're happening in front of him.",qd6vqv

Maybe they will do more with it in part 2, but in the books, the spice is a very complicated thing.  It has anti-aging properties, but can be incredibly addictive.  It can provide prescience, but the amount must be very carefully controlled to avoid driving the user insane.  Most importantly, it what allows for interstellar travel, because the guild members that are evolved for and trained in using it correctly can see well enough into the future to accurately chart navigation courses.

All that to say that in the book, it is a scientifically, politically, and ""magically"" important substance with a complicated industry springing up around it, not a simple metaphor for something in our real world.  I don't think any of that translated very well in the film, though.",qd6vqv

It didn't add anything besides the character being female and black, which is inclusive, while at the same time not removing anything since it didn't detract or remove anything from the story.

This is kind of like how it is in the books, although the Atreides family's trust in the doctor is more emphasised. However, Dr Yueh doing what he does isn't meant to be a surprise. In the book, you get told who the traitor is in chapter 2! You also find out about Yueh's wife in one line in the book. I don't think Yueh is meant to be some agent to add some mystery crime drama to the story. He's simply a vehicle to show how ruthless Baron is (e.g he makes deals but doesn't keep to them).

It's not your traditional ""chosen one"" story. It will make sense in second film. Most of the big plot reveals happen in the last 2 chapters of the book. There are even signs of what's to come in one of the visions he sees, although it's hard to make out (purposefully) what it means.",qd6vqv

Fitting it all into one movie allows us to have that character development, but because it is such a long book we cut lots and lots out (a la 1984 dune).

If we do multiple movies, we can capture all the nitty gritty detail and deep development of Paul, but lose the audience that doesn’t have the patience to sit through lots of minutia and exposition for the first 1/3 of the book.

Ultimately, longer dune adaptations are for people who enjoy large grandiose world-building sci fi films with commentary on politics, religion, etc and cool battles without much focus on individual characters. 

Spoiler, Paul is pretty much the character we see the most development in throughout the entirety of the first Dune and it is pretty much just your typical hero archetype. Obviously everyone who has read beyond the first book KNOWS he is not a hero, but in the first book he is",qd6vqv
hhnngtz,"Though I don’t think it sucked, I can’t help but think it could have used a lot more time in the oven.

Agreed, most visuals were spectacular but I could feel there was something missing to pull me in storywise. 

Call me crazy but I also feel like the cgi (especially at the beginning) looked a little unfinished? Just thought those wide shots of Letos forces on Caladan looked pretty fake. Same with Arakeen, looked so pristine and lifeless. I feel like they were better off using miniatures like in BR2049. Obviously this doesn’t have the benefit of a cyberpunk aesthetic where there’s shit flying everywhere but I still feel like it’s a few steps behind.

Game of Thrones seems to have been a flash in the pan in terms of the visual medium accurately portraying a believable world (i.e. if you asked ""why is this thing like that"" in terms of the setting you'd find a satisfying answer chain) and more importantly believable character dynamics.

The second is the huge failing of this movie. Zendaya and Paul have no meaningful relationship. Paul and Jessica have no meaningful relationship to care about. Every other character that we see pretty much dies or never interacts with others meaningfully.

As far as any emotion from their deaths, I only began to feel emotion when every single person that we've been introduced to has been picked off by this scheming army that has tilted the odds massively in their favor in a devious way. The walls are closing in and there is a sense of hopelessness from losing nearly every character that we got to know. That hit me.

* Make use of conventional narrative structures so that audience expectations are fulfilled

To all the comments contemptfully saying Dune ""isn't meant for you""... so Dune isn't meant for people who... like movies? Because none of the traits OP identifies are singular to summer blockbusters. They're just good storytelling, period.

I see comments defending, ""Well you're obsessed with book canon, so you won't get it.""

Which is it? It can't be both. 

This movie is bad. Not because Dune the book is bad; Dune is fantastic. I'm laughing my ass off at all the reviews *utterly lauding* Lynch's version. Do you know how badly that one was panned in 1984? It's been routinely dragged through the mud for 30+ years. Lynch is probably cackling in whatever surrealist house he lives in, never having anticipated that Villeneuve's Dune would be so shitty as to redeem his. In truth, it's famously weird. But it still mostly works because Lynch gave a shit and followed good story and filmmaking principles.

Villeneuve did not.

I'm sad that this movie sucked. If I have to wait another 40 years for a remake, I'll be in my 70s.

Oh, give me a break.

The film ends with the entire Resistance saved by the actions of one Luke Skywalker.

God, the Luke Skywalker scenes in ""The Last Jedi"" are so padded, ponderous and narcissistically self-important. Johnson's script asks a question that you already know the answer to: will Luke Skywalker come around and save The Resistance? Johnson then forces you to wait (the longest two and a half hours of your life) to see the solution ... that you'd already guessed. 

Ditto JGL's sacrifice at the end of ""Looper"".

I know that Johnson has a smirking, obnoxiousness self-importance that makes some people believe that the film was so damn terrific, but he really has garbage instincts. He has a sweaty, desperate-to-please theater kid energy. Not only does he want to entertain you, but he wants you to be painfully aware of how much EFFORT he puts into entertaining you. His films reek of unbelievable self-indulgence.

And there's nothing more obnoxious than Johnson's  passive-aggressive energy ... except maybe his endings. What irritates me about his films is that he has no respect for the audience's intelligence. He just can't resist. He just has to shove his message down our throats just until we missed the grand subtleties.

Wow, the audience IS broomboy. Man, Johnson is an artist for the ages.

That kind of hubris backfired in the most embarrassing way for Johnson. It may have been the kind of film when the critics are afraid to admit that they don’t like it, but audiences weren't stupid. They respond to stories worth telling and characters that they care about. People aren't invested in propagating a filmmaker's talking points and that's why they didn't buy into the critical hype of a grifter.",qd6vqv

1) They were popular enough among the other great houses that the Emperor feared they may prefer to answer to Atreides than to himself

2) House Atreides had developed a peerless fighting force that was rumored to be better than the Emperor's Sardaukar.  This is, well, a problem for the Emperor.

These are explained in the movie, albeit in passing.

House Harkonnen had become extremely rich, yes, but probably because they are a bunch of scheming and mendacious bastards, they had trouble with keeping an effective army.  Believe it or not, an army's strength is unit cohesion, not how backstabbing and untrustworthy your soldiers are.  I don't think this part is in the book but it goes very far to explain how house Atreides in particular could field such a potent force.  It's similar to Alexander the Great's army...they went to the far reaches of the world for them because of their loyalty to their king.  They usually incurred single digit losses while obliterating entire armies. 

House Atreides is based upon ancient Greek civilization, that's why Oscar Isaac is rocking that beard, lol.  Also that combat on the stairs, the Atreides army looked like it was in a mini-phalanx, an ancient Greek military formation.",qd6vqv

Just by virtue of time limitations and limitations of the medium alone a lot would need to be cut out.

I understand how book readers are left feeling incomplete, but as someone who didn't read the book the film was a major achievement. The story was completely legible and told in an extremely engrossing way that merged plot and story wonderfully while displaying some of the best action sequences and battle sequences I have ever seen. 

Ultimately this film should be nothing but celebrated.

It wasn't supposed to be about whether Paul could win or not, it was supposed to be about his internal conflict about having to kill the man. That's why DV added those visions of them becoming friends in an alternate timeline, to humanize Jamis, because he knows how desensitized to protagonists killing people we all are.

At this point Paul is beginning to have visions about possible futures, during the sandstorm we get a shot of Jamis talking to Paul. That's a moment from one of the possible futures that Paul gets glimpses of. Paul doesn't want to kill Jamis, he has ""memories"" of them being close friends in the future. When he does, it's not only symbolic of him becoming a man, but it's symbolic of him giving up the identity of Paul Atreides and taking on a new one (which will play out in the next movie). That's why he chooses to stay on Arrakis, because he has some idea of how future events will play out.

The conflicting part for me is while I appreciated the visuals, they miss out on a ton of details. Frank Herbert basically left nothing unexplained - every single character richly developed and the world immersively constructed, almost to a fault. The movie oversimplified a lot of things that I was only able to fill in the gaps myself having read the book. I've heard other book readers say it somehow moves too fast while nothing really happens.

I didn't know anything about this movie/book going in. I thought it was visually *stunning*, the soundtrack was cool, the atmosphere was extremely unique... but I had no fucking clue what was going on. The dialogue was difficult to hear, and hard to understand when I did.

 The characters felt very flat and I had a very barebones concept of anyone's motivation. The emperor didn't like Paul's house so he sends them to the desert planet to die off, and their rival house attacks them, and then Paul goes to live with the desert people because he had visions of Zendaya... like okay. I felt like I'm missing every bit of context on who anyone is or *why* they're doing anything. Case in point: the nun people with the magic voice. What the fuck was even that? 

Things just happen, we see a long panning shot, and then we're on to the next scene to rinse and repeat.

The Hero's family planned to rule much more graciously than the prior rulers, which was why they sent a warrior to meet with the locals and invited a leader to meet with their house leadership shortly after landing.  

There had essentially been 61 years of low level oppression and insurrection.

Gurney Halleck hints at it at the start during the training scene. We all know what shields do in general sci fi. Yet, during the training Gurney says ""the slow blade penetrates the shield"".

> Why didn't Paul or mom use his voice power when fighting to the death at the end?

The voice isn't a ""win button"", it's not like an all-in-one key that works on every keyhole. It's not fully explained in the movies and it's not as obvious as the above, but Jessica hints at it a little saying ""you have to find the right pitch"". This is expanded on in the books.

Spice is a hallucinagin that increases mental ability and gives precognitive powers, and Pauls reaction to it was not an allergic reaction to it, but it beginning to affect his mind.  


The Bene Gesserit are a quasi-religious order that seek to create a god emperor they call the Kwisatz Haderach through millennia of breeding and training to gain mastery over their bodies. They serve the emperor, but their ultimate goal is to breed the Kwisatz Haderach so that he may rule the galaxy, and be loyal to them. They have total control over their bodies, and the voice is manifested through speaking in a tone that connects them to the brains of others. You need to be specially trained from birth in order to use the voice, and it can be defended against with technology, which is why the baron had that cone of silence thing. it can only control things that can understand you.

Jessica is a Bene Gesserit, but has drawn the ire of their leader by having a son so she could bear duke Leto an heir, and also so that her son may be the Kwisatz Haderach. since she has total control over her body, she made the conscious choice to have a son.   


Shields stop anything that travels at a sufficient velocity to be dangerous, but not things moving slow enough so that air can still pass through and the guarded subject can still have movement. anything that moves slowly enough can penetrate the shield, which is why they use swords and dart guns.

Because he's so fat that he has to rely on ""suspensors"" to carry him around, which is supposed to contribute to this sense of inhuman grotesqueness characterizing the Baron... except it really doesn't work in Villenueve's Dune because the Baron just looks like, I dunno, regular fat? Skarsgård is a great actor but his (and everyone's) performance is totally hamstrung in this movie. When the Baron is first revealed in that steam room I almost laughed--he looks like a grumpy little baby. **Please** go watch Lynch's 1984 Dune if you haven't already, where the Harkonnens are rendered in full, nauseating glory.

Lol no fucking clue, but Villenueve got to show some naked 14-year-old girl ass because he just looooves his female characters.

&#x200B;

>Why is Paul allergic to Spice?

Sigh... he's not, and the fact that the film puts this idea into everyone's heads who hasn't read the book is a great example of why the film is broken. The spice kinda fucks with space-time (hence why the Guild navigators use it to fold space) and gives people visions anyways? And since Paul is predisposed to these visions as the soon-to-be kwisatz haderach, the spice kicks his visions into overdrive in a way that freaks him out at first. But he's not ""allergic"" to it. You'd never know this from the film though! The way Paul freaks out in the tent like ""ahh there's spice in here"" makes it seem like an allergy, when he's really just dismayed by the visions. But that's totally mishandled as well--he's supposed to be dismayed at seeing himself as the leader of a jihad led by the Fremen. Which is not at all explained.

All these are excellent questions and a simple flashback from Jessica could've explained a lot of them. Alas...

As for killing the sandworms, the film also fails to point out clearly enough that *the worms make the spice.* It's hinted at when Kynes points out that ""you can see the spice"" on the surface of the sand and in another scene when the sandworm leaves, we see the sand looking similarly red-tinted, but this is *not obvious.* Yes, this connection is supposed to be a juicy reveal later in the story, but you get hints all along in the book.

The movie actually made these people seem slightly more human than how they appear in the books. These are the same complaints that have always been with the series. 

This movie is so faithful to the spirit of the books that it's experiencing the same issues people have had with them. It's glorious!

One of them themes of the books is absolutely this lack of control and agency. Paul really is damned just because of centuries of breeding, Duncan has very little control of his own life and death, Jessica's entire story is about her own lack of control because of her past, and everyone else important is trying to control humanity's narrative for their own odds and ends. It really is a harsh world that benefits absolutely no one. What does Harkonnen spend his money on? We really have no idea, he just wants control and money is a means to that. 

The common people really do not factor into this story. They really are just there to be resources, to be used as statistics for when the bad things happen. Everyone is there to be controlled by someone else.

And I don't blame you for going into this movie thinking it was something it isn't. We all bill it as Game of Thrones in space but the fact is, it isn't that. In some ways I feel like GRRM probably wrote the characters of ASOIAF as a response to the machine-like people in Dune.

It mentions this in the movie, when Baron is inside that vat of black liquid. He said he spent all his wealth on bringing the fleet here to Arrakis, and all he needs now is ""income"".

In the book, it expands on it more (because it has the luxury to do so). We know from the movie that the Spacing Guild is the one who transports all ships across the universe. If you want to participate in galactic space travel you have to pay them. In the books it expands on it saying how even transporting half a dozen ships costs a fortune (even for the rich people). The book further expands on it, saying that Leto didn't expect there to be an orbital invasion because the idea of having a whole fleet of ships coming from space was unimaginable. The books further has Baron saying how he's basically in debt for the next tens to hundreds of years (forgot exact length but it's definitely many years). And this is not personal debt, we're talking kingdom levels of debt here (so like trillion and trillions).

> They have no interests or motivations beyond mining spice or plotting a centuries long eugenics programme.

I mean yeah, there's nothing much else on the planet other than spice which the whole universe relies upon. 90% of the planet isn't even populated because the conditions are too harsh, so if you're expecting parades through the streets or public bars with music playing in background, like that in Star Wars New Hope this isn't that kind of planet.

This is a good time to bring up Harry Potter 4 and the idea of plot vs story. 

Plot is what happens. Story is the tensions--who wants what, why, etc. Story makes a narrative move. Plot is just the facts.

A lot of people were pissed the HP4 cut out the Quidditch World Cup--but it was the right move because it's just a plot point, not a story one. It doesn't matter to the story that Ireland beats Bulgaria, but that Barty Crouch gets loose and creates a tone of fear with the Dark Mark--which HP4 still features without having to waste time in the stadium. 

The box and the gom jabbar... it's not quite plot-only, since it's meant to introduce the scheming of the Bene Gesserit and Paul's path to messiah-hood, but even writing that out, it's still a theme-exposition event, one that makes us curious more than racheting up tension, and Villanueve really gives *no context* other than some 1-second long visions from Paul and Jessica sniveling like 5-year-old. It's no wonder that someone unfamiliar with the book would have no idea what to do with that scene.

- We learn at the start that he disapproves of his mother sharing personal information about his dreams with the Reverend Mother

- We learn that at one point he even hates and is angered by his mother for making him be a part of this Bene Gesserit breeding program. 

- We learn that while Paul is realising the significance of all these new experiences he's feeling with the spice, that he sees a troubled future where he is the driving force. He knows he can't avoid it and he blames his mother and the Bene Gesserit for creating him in an unnatural way for that sole purpose.

We find out even more about Paul when he meets with the Fremen (which the second movie is mostly about). You have to realise that this isn't a full story, so not everything will be fully realised until the next film (which completes the whole book). In the book, there are some things about Paul (big things relating to his existence), that you don't find out up until the last chapter of the book.

hiamlbk,"> The story was so bland and it ends in such a lame and unsatisfying way.

I think that's partly down to the way Villeneuve makes films. He doesn't drip feed you the story and instead makes you piece it together (He does a similar thing in Blade Runner 2049 where a lot of the sub-plots and themes require you to piece mini-sections of the film).

I wouldn't say the story is bland for example. A group of mystical witches who have been conducting experimental genetic mixing over thousands of years to create a super human and at the same time plant fake religions on planets so that one day when the super human being is realised they can manipulate those civilizations. All sounds pretty good to me, and that's just what we find out about just one of the factions. 

All of this is mentioned in the movie, however they're explained in a few brief sentences and broken up across the movie. For example when the Mother Reverend is leaving the planet at the beginning and is talking to Jessica, the whole Bene Gesserit plan is briefly talked about amongst them. However they don't dwell on it long as if it's such a significant thing because why would the witches talk about it so in-depth like its new to them? It makes sense that they talk about it in passing.

In the books its explained in much more detail, but that's because it comes with Appendices explaining a lot of stuff outside of the story.",qd6vqv

hidny8d,">  Everyone can understand that a suit protects you from the environment

It's not there to emphasise the harsh environment, it's explained how it works because it's not your usual army suit. It is invented for the sole purpose of emphasising how arid/waterless this world is. Or otherwise there would be no explanation how the Fremen (who exclusively live in the middle of the desert) live without water. They get most of their water via recycling their own body fluids with these suits.

> They introduce completely new off worlds just for showing one or two scenes.

I wouldn't say they introduce you to offworld. Baron is on a completely different planet. How are they meant to show his part without ever mentioning ""oh he's not on arrakis at this point but somewhere else"". So they say he's on Geidi Prime and then show the scene revealing that he's in an alliance with the Emperor and the Bene Gesserit mother knows about it.

> When he later betrays Leto it's probably meant to be a big thing

His traitorous act isn't meant to be a big thing. They reveal who the traitor is in the books in the second chapter (attack happens in something like chapter 30). The point is how and why Yueh became a traitor, which gives a reflection of the kind of villain the Baron is.

> But in the movie there is so little in between them the dreams felt like a annoying distraction

In the books and movie, the dreams become more frequent as Paul is exposed to more of the Spice. He barely had any exposure to spice before in his home planet Caladan. Maybe the spice was only found in food, which resulted in his initial (rare) dreams. But when they moved to Arrakis the spice was in the air, the ground, which is when the visions became more stronger and frequent.

I know the visions are frequent, but each one is different, and in one of them there's even a crucial sign of Paul's future which he fears.",qd6vqv
hili5au,">  For me they could have skipped the first part of the movie entirely. Just start with the arrival on Arrakis, follow Paul more closely. Compress his visions in bigger chunks. Don't try to make me care for 10 different people. Show me how the world works in stead of describing it.

I had the exact same thought. The storytelling was so poor in this aspect. Stay with Paul. Discover the new world through his curiosity. Learn the political stuff from what he hears in meetings or from a mentor. Show the training with his mother and the powers he has. Just give me a hook, I'm begging you.",qd6vqv

It begs the question of why the Atredies would be so poorly prepared for attackers to simply walk in and charge. It's because without the betrayal they couldn't have walked in and charged. The betrayal serves to make sense of that no less than it serves as something which has impact on its own.",qd6vqv

The fight at the end of FoTR with the orcs felt like a half act, considering their threat was not a big and grandiose like the Balrog. Similarly in Dune you have the ending with the fight with Jamis, where it doesnt fully feel like you're coming to a climax.

Most of the characters were not intriguing, except for the Reverend mother, the Baron and whatever the young boys at the Harkonnen's were up to. The acting was dull, the dialogue trite, uninspired and non-memorable and no-one seemed like nobles. Jessica was wrongly characterised, crying and shivering in so many scenes - she didn't at all seem like a competent BG and had few scenes to demonstrate her intelligence and observational skills. Why was she lying outside in the rain, cowering in fear?

Duke Leto interpreted the trap as the Emperor pitting 2 powerful houses against one another leading ultimately to each weakening each other and strengthening the Emperor. A danger for sure, but that sounds like a more drawn out battle that more than likely results in political and proxy battles instead of an all out attack.

> Why did the transition team not have a 3rd party like the spacing guild to oversee the process change hands.

1. We know that the Emperor was sanctioning the attack against House Atreides so it could've easily been rigged and 2. there was Kynes who acts as judge for the Emperor and oversees the changing of the fiefdom to House Atreides. She even mentions in the film how she is impartial and does not interfere in house affairs. Officially her only worry is if Arrakis is suitable for spice collection. 

> Why did no other house send any aid as they were being attacked?

While I don't remember specifically what you're referring to, I think it could be possible that paul might've at least imagined the posibility of losing on purpose, because he knew all the trouble that would come if he moved forward with his story, and he knew that taking himself out of the picture is possibly a responsible option. 

is it clear to the audience that that's a possibility though? The movie obviously deals with the heroes journey, and the idea of a messiah (That was far from subtle) and that might be all that it seems like at a glance, but paul isn't just a messianic figure. He's a messianic figure gone wrong. How evident is the ""gone wrong"" part of that equation to people who aren't familiar with the story. I""m not sure.

During that scene where Paul has a vision of himself looking down on a bunch of his subjects, with Chani alongside him, his clape blowing in the wind (awesome image) that's not supposed to have vibes of the sermon on the mount. It's supposed to have vibes of scar from the lion king saying ""stick with me..""

The actual explanation isn't really needed for the movie because they would have to spend time explaining it fully all just for one moment of the film, which regardless of you know or not, they would have had to gone with the Fremen in the end anyway.

So in the movie, it kind of hints at it when Jessica constantly reminds Paul ""You have to find the right pitch"". The voice isn't like a key that fits all holes. The pitch has to be changed and varies across different people depending on the targets frame of mind. Jessica needs to at least spend some time psychoanalyzing the target so that she can find a pitch that is suitable for that particular target. With the guards in the aircraft when they were caught, they had the whole flight to be analyzed. The encounter with Stilgar was more of an ambush and too little time to analyze every single person or even just Stilgar alone.",qd6vqv

Something Denis Villneueve does a lot on his films is he lays down the broad strokes of information with quick details then relies on the viewer to piece that aspect of world building together. Love it or hate it, that's how he does it.

In the books the reason for them not using guns is explained over the course of a couple of paragraphs (which would be a lot in film time).

In the movie, this full explanation is highlighted by one sentence: At the beginning of the movie where Gurney Halleck is training with Paul. We see a shield being activated and from popular sci fi fiction most people know what shields are used for. But then Gurney says ""The slow blade penetrates the shield"". That's it. Quick explanation, that kind of needs the viewer to connect the dots together a little, but that's the way Denis does stuff.",qd6vqv

did you pick up on the line when they're sparring 'the slow blade penetrates the shield?'  Something moving quickly (a bullet,   a quick thrust of a sword) is deflected by the shield.  Which is why they use swords, knives, and must advance the blade slowly.

By giving Paul's family the best fief in the galaxy, he had the makings of a good reward, though somewhat obvious trap.  They couldn't really refuse (they're the strongest house and this is the best fief), but by accepting they're essentially on notice that the house that lost it would want to fight them for it, too.

When he has the visions of Jamies being a friend/mentor to him, and helping him learn of the desert, all of that was true, just not in the way he prophesized it. And how he saw Jameis comforting him in death in his vision, he did the same for Jamies in reality. It really hit an emotional note for me. All I could think of was Pauls line from the book ""I was a friend of Jamies"". I hope they include that bit in the sequel.

In the book, not being married is a real area of concern for Jessica and directly impacts the way people treat her.

Would you be walking the streets in 140°F heat? The only people who are seen out are the Fremen, who would kill themselves just to get a glance at the potential messiah.

2. They filed all three movies at once and were able to release them quickly one after the other. It will be two years at a minimum before Dune 2 is released. 
3. Fellowship has well written, easy to understand characters and a strong emotional climax with Boromir's death and Frodo choosing to leave his friends. Dune's climax was Paul killing an unknown character in a knife fight. For people who aren't familiar with the book, it has no meaning.",qd6vqv

I wouldn't really compare everything against Marvel. Marvel has a certain way/formula of doing their movies. You don't expect a marvel film to be more slower paced, more dialogue or scenery heavy.

Dune mostly revolves around political, religious and cultural themes. Even in the movie those themes are hammered into you constantly because those are the main points of the story.

Adaptations are supposed to be able to stand on their own feet, and unless this was supposed to just cater to the readers of the book which it certainly isn't because it cost 160m$ to do then it needs to do more in explaining to a newcomer what is going on and why certain things have happened.

I feel like there was huge amounts of unexplored material here, and a lot of weird things such as never really getting any emotional attach to anyone. Why should I feel empathy for a character dying when you haven't build any characteristics and attributes about them that a viewer should care about?
For a movie that feels so slow, it also feels very rushed in many scenes,i get that they were going for showing the visual scale and liked overview images a lot, but close ups that show emotion of the actors and characters would have helped immensely.

It's also worth mentioning that Villenueve's decision to plow into the second half of the narrative is just fucking moronic. He ruins the fight with Jamis because the fight is stripped of its narrative significance.

See, there's this thing in film/narrative called the [midpoint twist](https://philipp.truebiger.com/three-act-structure/). It's where something surprising (and usually detrimental to our heroes) happens, and marks a major shift in the story. The midpoint twist (and larger 3-act structure that it's a part of) is such a common hallmark of storytelling that you can literally count how long a book is, divide that number by 2, open to that page of the book, and you'll probably be reading in the midpoint twist. That same goes for movies: If you're on Netflix and the movie is 120 minutes long, go to minute 60 and bam. Midpoint twist.

I decided to try this with Dune, knowing full well what I'd find. My book is... 490 pages long. Divided by two is 245. I opened it up. Where are we?

In the tent. IN THE MOTHERFUCKING TENT. Which is the midpoint twist marking a major shift for our heroes. Paul came to Arrakis as the prince of a new reign--but here he is, alone and Duke by tragic circumstances. Jessica is a widow. They're stranded in the desert, exiled and left for dead.

This is where I thought the film would end. Where it should have ended. 

BUT NO, Villenueve is like ""Oh, thousands of years of human storytelling rules? Nah fuck those, let's just zip right ahead to act 2 AND OKAY we're done here""

Paul's besting of Jamis *is supposed to function* as rising action for act 2, establishing his credibility not only as the would-be kwisatz haderach, but as a member of the Fremen community. When Villenueve *bisects act 2* he totally messes up the pacing, the heartbeat of the film. The fight seems random and ancillary because we haven't been properly introduced to the act 2 tensions yet because apparently Villenueve paces like he fucks.

You stop on midpoints or act breaks. You don't stop in the middle of acts!!!!!!!

This would be like Luke finding Princess Leia in A New Hope and Lucas being like ""OKAY FAM we're done here stay tuned for STAR WARS 2: THE TRASH COMPACTOR STRIKES BACK

Do you know why people say that? It's not because it shares the same themes. LOTR influenced 90% of fantasy we see today (Harry Potter, Wheel of Time, etc). Similarly Dune is seen as the Godfather of sci-fi as it influenced Star Wars, Warhammer, Wheel of Time (again). It doesn't mean it will have the same feel, but more like a similar scale to it's world building and its influences.

> The lore is intriguing which makes me even more annoyed because there is no way in hell I am watching the other two parts so I'll miss out on that.

Some of that lore, will come back to the storyline later on. This is, after all, only half the story. Think about LOTR, if Fellowship of the Ring finished after the first film we would never never know how the Ring went from being lost at the bottom of the river to Gollum's hand (we find that out in 3rd film). We would never find out that the Witch King exists (we find that out in the second film).

The benefit for LOTR is, that the source material comes with clean cuts at the end of each book. Dune was never meant to be split up, so you but it's the only way it could be filmed. So you need the second film to make sense of a lot of things said in the first film (lore).",qd6vqv

Herbert is a very dry author. Dune isn’t full of swashbuckling and aliens, and I think thats what some people were expecting going into the movie. 

The first two books are philosophy lessons told through story. I was working a really physically taxing job while I listened to the audiobook so I felt like it was a great way to keep my mind occupied while I sweated. If you have something like that in your life, then the audiobook may be a good path.

I can tell you, the stories get weird. Really weird. The concepts are bizarre. The situations are outrageous.

May I suggest watching silent movies from 1900? In modern times movies aren't just about visuals, the dialogue and even the sound can progress a story.

This is not an action film, more of a political drama with religious and theological elements to it.

Time in not linear. Paul sees all the different possible timelines. That is why when the Reverend Mother asks Paul at the start ""Do your dreams come true"", Paul replies ""Not always"". Because the only timeline that comes true is the path he walks, but that path isn't decided when he sees the visions.

So in one vision he sees a time line where he gets stabbed. In another vision he sees himself becoming best friends with Jamis who teaches him the ways of the desert and the Fremen ways. All of this is retained by Paul as memories, even though they haven't and might not even happen.

They would have both died. There are like 50 Sardaukar there. The movie made Duncan look kind of OP, he should have never been able to kill that many.

The voice isn't some instant win technique, it isn't like a key that fits all holes. The pitch has to be changed and varies across different people depending on the targets frame of mind. Jessica needs to at least spend some time psychoanalyzing the target so that she can find a pitch that is suitable for that particular target. Being ambushed by Saraukar leaves no time for any analyzing (same reason why she didn't use it when they were jumped by the Fremen).",qd6vqv

Had the Emperor simply outright killed the Duke, it would have united the other houses against him, because they would fear suffering the same fate as the Duke, which is why in the movie Paul asks Liet if she would testify to what she witnessed in front of the Laandsrad.

Jessica was talking with regards to the Bene Gesserit, that they have been conducting crossbreeding experiment over thousands of years.

In the books its expanded upon where they say the Bene Gesserit pick out certain noble individuals and send one of the Bene Gesserit sisters to have a child with them (usually a female). Through out the ages, the Bene Gesserit basically cross breed until finally one day the ultimate human being is born. Thing is, no one else in the universe knows of this plan and the Bene Gesserit plant fake religions on planets in preparation for hundreds of years into the future when the ultimate being is born. Then the Bene Gesserit can use the ultimate human being to manipulate and control civilizations who think he's a messiah. Of course the greatest power of all is to have this super human on your side.

> In one scene Paul tells Jessica ""You are pregnant"". 

Paul's powers aren't just future-seeing, his senses are heightened. That bit there is a glimpse of his powers where he knows something that he shouldn't be able to know.

> The next scene she cries inconsolably in the hall before talking to Leto.

Jessica is crying because she realises Paul is the Super Human Being (Kwisatz Haderach) and she knows that just means bad stuff for him.

One of the reasons the Emperor is scared of Leto is the ""Atreides Way,"" where his men and the rest of the Landsraad (other house rulers) look up to him and instinctively trust his leadership, and might follow him if he chose to attempt a takeover.

One of the ways he impressed the Fremen and others was sacrificing the spice crawler and risking himself in order to save the workers from the worm.  Apparently it was unthinkable that a Duke or other ruler would do that.  Except for an Atreides.

It's gorgeous, the scale is impressive, and almost every single thing on screen looks like the perfect visual adaptation of Herbert. At the same time, the dialogue feels stilted at times, characters work well but don't exactly *evolve* (tbf I think this is present in the novel as well), and I can't help but think if I wasn't a big fan of the books, I'd have missed a ton of fairly important details. Each one of those is perhaps an inevitable result of trying to make a movie out of the first 1/3 of a book, particularly given the sheer complexity of the story and setting. 

Personally, I don't think I could have hoped for much better; I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'll see it again for sure. But I can understand how a lot of other people might feel ""meh"" after walking out of it. If you are a Denis fan, you'll enjoy it. If you're a Dune fan, you'll enjoy it.

1917, King Kong (any version) and LoTR all told a good tale as a consequence of a well scripted plot, attractive and effective actors, good music and potent visuals.

This Dune had actors nearly perfectly physically and emotionally suited to their roles.  (I don't mind Halleck being prettified and the female planetologist played at least one of her roles well.) The music was evocative and the visuals interesting and effective, especially in creating a theme for each community.

The movie, however, did not present Dune, the novel.  The novel's complex plot was discarded and replaced by a Classics Comics version.  The dialogue contained only a hint of Herbert's voice. The characters were directed into one-dimensional cardboard cutout characters of themselves.

I love 1917 because it's a realistic depiction told through the lens of a soldier in which everything happens in this one linear moment (which ends). All of the films you mention still stick to a 3 act structure, they have a beginning, a middle and most importantly an end. Fellowship of the Ring ends with both the resolution of Gandalf's and Boromir's deaths in battle, and then with the Fellowship splitting. There is a clear third act despite the story still continuing in the next film - Dune does not have this.

>""Who are the people in the white armor who hide in the sand waiting to ambush??""

Fremen. The Fremen are bad-asses who live in the desert all the time and have learned to use it to their advantage when the situation calls for it. If you're specifically referring to the future vision, you might be confused by the armor since we haven't seen that yet. But that's the same tactic used by the Fremen in the ecological station when the Sardaukar attack.

>""Why wouldn’t everyone have their shields turned on 24/7?""

Despite being very awesome and useful, you don't use shields in the open desert because it attracts worms and makes them go bonkers. Aside from desert situations, I assume that shields aren't on 24/7 due to power constraints. I don't know if this is the *actual* reason, but I'd assume that shields use considerable power and don't last indefinitely. 

>""Why didn’t Paul just use the voice to win the duel at the end?""

I'm pretty sure that would have gotten him and his mother killed. That was supposed to be a ""fair fight"", and Stilgar was already getting pissed off when Paul repeatedly avoided killing Jamis. Stilgar thought that Paul was just toying with Jamis, despite the fact that Paul's hesitation to kill was because he has never killed before. Paul *hypothetically* could have used the voice to defeat Jamis (though that might not have worked, since it was already demonstrated that Paul isn't very good at it). Still, even if that had worked, there's still a *bunch* of Fremen standing around who would likely say that it was a bullshit win, and then both him and Lady Jessica get butchered for cheating at one of the Fremen's sacred rituals.

At the end right before Duncan's hallway fight?  The people that hid in the sand were Freman.  The white armor guys are Saudukar.  The Saudukar were sneaking into the ""base"".  It didn't work, because the Freman that were cooking, noticed and hid in the sand .  Then the Freman ambushed the Saudukar.  The Freman ambushed the ambushers.

>Why the hell didn’t Dunkin just escape with Paul, his mom, and the freman lady?? I know they “only had room for 2” in the plane, but previously they were able fit extra people in the planes in that first worm scene.

Duncan realized that his duke couldn't get away without someone staying behind to defend the door. Also the thopter Paul and Jessica escaped in looked different and didn't have a back area like the other, larger ones.

>How do you fall asleep in the middle of a sandstorm in a twirling, broken plane?

I took that as passing out from the g-forces.

>Why wouldn’t everyone have their shields turned on 24/7?

Because it makes it harder to interact with normal things and everyday life.

>Why do people never do the sand walk to avoid the worms? Seems like everyone just runs in the sand Willy nilly. Even when Paul and his mom do the sand walk a worm still comes.

Freman do sand walk all the time.  The worm didn't attack Paul and Jessica at first because they were sand walking.  That worm was just passing by.  It wasn't till Paul and Jessica hit Drum Sand (loud noise making sand) that the worm was attracted and attacked.  

>Why didn’t Paul just use the voice to win the duel at the end?

It's explained better in the book.  Paul is still not great at the voice, so who knows if he could do it while fighting.  Jessica could but in the books the Freman know about ""witch magic"".  Bene Gesserit  are often called witches by people. She is forbid from speaking during the fight or Paul will automatically lose.",qd6vqv

So now Leto is taking on the bull in the form of Vladimir, he knows its a trap, hes aware of their entire plan but their hands are tied, at least this way he knows where the knife is coming from and also has to take it head on (which the film did need to flesh out a tad bit more so people dont think hes naive or an idiot) but even so the bull takes him down. 

Its why the bull is up above him in his final scene, its kind of an omen, the bull that killed his father, and Vladimir hovering over him ready to kill him, and hes going down fighting against Vladimir like his father did with the bull.

hhzvmly,Why wouldn't you do a TV series then?,qd6vqv
hjxjlae,"Still.  Villeneuve made some arguable and sometimes even headscratching decision in how he alloted the screentime he had.

**(very) Arguable :**

\-Villeneuve clearly favored the planetary romance angle and the hero's journey angle over the space opera/politics angle  and the new age angle. I am quite disappointed about this choice but to some extent I can understand.

\-  I also think  he deliberately avoided any ""info dump"" sequence and favored the ""show don't tell"" approach . I usually favor this approach too  but I think skipping those altogether for Dune, which has some grade-a worldbuilding, was very arguable to say the least. Herbert probably gave so many teachers to Paul partly to make the exposition easier. Some sequences are barely understandable in what I saw at the theater. Seriously how a newcomer can understand what the gom jabbar test is really about just by watching Villeneuve version ?  I can't help feeling he wanted to set himself apart from Lynch version who stupidly reproduced the internal dialogues. So Villeneuve went to the other extreme of the spectrum, purely visual,  to show what a movie ""adaptation"" is about. To stay diplomatic, let's say he favored a more visceral experience.

\-spending so much time on Calladan (barely covered in the book) or Chani dreams and in the other hand barely explaining what the Bene Gesserit was extremely arguable. He's going to pay the price in the sequel(s) : His version of Kwisatch haderach is already flimsy but good luck explaining properly why Alia is an abomination now.  And if it ever gets to Children of Dune (it's been hinted he wanted to shoot 3 Dune movies) ,   the Golden Path is going to feel tepid without the Bene gesserit worldview. I think skipping so much on the Bene Gesserit lore was a big mistake long term.  CHOAM, Landsraad, Guild, Bene tleilax, Mentats, Butlerian Jihad ...You can somehow live without that or with a diet Coke version of it. But I think you just can't build a proper Dune universe without a proper explanation of the Bene Gesserit. Jessica, Alia, Imperium politics, New age training, Lisan al gaib/missoniara protectiva,. .the Bene Gesserit are the cornerstone of the Dune universe.

**Straightup storytelling blunder**

just  one exemple : why spend some time on introducing the Shadout Mapes character if it's to just introduce her and then kill her ???  to build up the Lisan al-gaib thing ? he could have done so with the crowd and Liet.  Introducing Mapes is just a waste of time based on the course he chosed.  He should have either choose to build up Arraken intrigue  or keep it at its bare minimum.

There's no but or if about the Shadout Mapes.  And there are several things like that.

It's impressive movie production wise and still interesting. But I feel like he screwed the pooch at several places.",qd6vqv

hht9gvj,Respectfully disagree - I think saying spice is necessary for interstellar travel was enough to get the point across to the viewer. Frankly the emphasis Lynch’s dune puts onto the navigators grinds the film to a temporary halt and I bet they wanted to avoid that.,qd6vqv

hhq379c,"Yeah, I keep comparing this to Lynch's version, and despite the garbage visuals, I absolutely loved how the older film showed space travel.  They got in these giant ships, and you're like, cool, and then they flew into a MASSIVE space cylinder with all of this ornamentation, and a navigator shows up and the entire thing just fades into to a new a planet's orbit...  This Dune just kind of glossed over it... I think it is fine to not show the navigators, but the journey should have had a bit more screen time in my opinion.  It is like if they never showed the Millennium Falcon entering hyperspace in the Star Wars.",qd6vqv

htdzgxb,"Not broken, he's never going to give her up or anything, but I would say their relationship is strained, with tension growing stronger over the film, with him feeling like he's more of a special project and less of a son to her.



I think he will go back and forth on this, at times blaming her and at times realising her designs for him is also an expression of love, meant to aid him in trying times.",qd6vqv

hi7crjw,I found myself comparing it to LOTR as well and also noticed that the biggest difference between them is LOTR has heart. The only character I cared for in Dune was Momoa's.,qd6vqv
hi522ts,Agreed. I don't feel like there's any reason to really root for the MC other than the fact that we're basically told he's the good guy. I don't think this film did a good job at building the characters personalities and providing a compelling reason to root for them on a human level.,qd6vqv
hj3av1e,I felt similarly. I admittedly don’t know anything about Dune but I walked away basically thinking “I watched 2.5 hours of them just sort of buying time for the next 3 hours that will really matter. Duncan was seemingly the only character worth caring about.,qd6vqv
hjdmc64,"To be fair, the books don't really have any warm/cozy character either. Paul is pretty much a cold calculated messiah figure. The only ""warmth"" he shows is toward Chani (which might happen in part 2), and even then, it's not your typical love story.",qd6vqv
hi7arva,That is an interesting take and I wonder how much my view is tinted as a book reader. Here's to hoping it gets kicked up a notch in the sequel now that so many side characters got killed off,qd6vqv

That's partially the point",qd6vqv
hjojw52,"Yep. Paul is a bore. I don't care about him. 


I cared about Mamoa.",qd6vqv
hlw8jc8,"Yeah I think so too. The world did not feel alive as well. I think that the director cut scenes Paul interacting with others and the Arrakis to not make the movie longer. Every important people in the first movie died, I guess that's why the director didn't want to expand on their relationships. I think the second movie is gonna be more Paul-centric and will show the culture and the people of Arrakis. If you think that part 1 and part 2 are meant to be one movie, all is well. Still, weird that director did not choose to flesh out the world and its rules. I was wondering why the hell no one has an automatic rifle or something, lol.",qd6vqv

Considering that the attack can only occur because of Dr Yueh’s betrayal and the Dr talks about how they (the Baron) tore apart his wife in another scene it is possible that is her.

He fully knows she won’t be set free but exchanges the Altriedes defense sabotage for her death since living like that to him is a fate worse than death itself.

The movie feels disjointed sometimes - jumping from one scene to another : why introduce the mater to not give her any other scene besides dying ?
Why speak of not marrying Jessica out of the blue and without ever explaining the alliance consideration ? Especially considering there’s a callback at the end of the book - “don’t make the mistake your father made”.   That’s a pretty big character point to skip, especially considering how much Villeneuve seems to invest in Chani character and her importance for Paul.

Show Thufir rolling eyes and never speak of Mentat ? 

I mean there are some very surprising choices but there are part that feel straight out cut from a much longer version. Either that or Villeneuve went for an extreme version of show don’t tell. There’s also the possibility that the storytelling abilities of Villeneuve are a lot lower than What I thought.",qd6vqv

Atreides have just outstanding leadership quality and are respected because they are deemed the most honorable. Honor : the strength and weakness of House Atreides.

Beyond any acting/contract considerations around showing faces, I had a surprisingly hard time keeping track of who was who. Even with only a few characters onscreen, I'd mostly register it as interchangeable people in grey suits and earth-toned cloaks (which is great for extras, but tricky when we need to know who's doing what). I think it could work if they set of precedent of characters wearing consistent, distinctive colors throughout the film (vs frequent costume changes with mostly-neutral colors), but that would also need some suspension of disbelief.",qd6vqv

hhl01qw,"I thought that was really well executed to portray that Paul's visions aren't true exact visions (as he mentions to Rev Mother Mohaim in his interview).

The Jamis of the vision told Paul that he would teach him the ways of the desert (or something to that effect).  And though the movie kind of flops at portraying it, that fight and death were a pivotal moment of Paul becoming a man of the desert, rather than a boy seeking refuge.",qd6vqv
hhmpgqy,"Jamis \*was\* Paul's guide, and he \*did\* teach him the ways of the desert.  Killing Jamis was the lesson.",qd6vqv

He sees himself dying to Jamis a couple times in the movie, but understood that in order for him and his family to survive, he had to take the path where he kills Jamis and takes on the mantle of Muad'ib. The reason Paul knows all of the Fremen customs is because he had Prescient visions of Jamis explaining them to him because he's seen that timeline (combined with him being trained as a Mentats)",qd6vqv

hhlqne8,I loved that shot.,qd6vqv
hhmyp7l,"I absolutely **loved** that. Because it serves 2 big purposes. 

A) It's a PG13 movie, so it's not graphic by censor standards. But also makes the scene *feel* more brutal than it visually is.

&

2) It shows the importance of water on Arrakis. That water is life, and in this specific case water is the ""*lifeblood*"" of Dr. Kynes.

It's such a tiny blink-and-miss-it sequence yet it conveys so much. Simply brilliant.",qd6vqv
hhnf3h3,That was such a cool effect,qd6vqv
hilufl7,Yep.  Her water broke.,qd6vqv
hi5whd7,The slow ship pierces the water.,qd6vqv

hhl3j2k,"It's also a challenge: in a film already running at 2 hrs and a half, developing Liet further and spending the time it takes for the death monologue... it would be too much.

I know Dennis could individually do justice toneach key element of the book, but im the context of a film, he made necessary compromises.",qd6vqv
hhl6y0x,"Everyone is underdeveloped, even Paul, it would really need hours to give every character its own space.

Mentats are barely addressed, Thufir has a cameo, not a role, other people have said about the baliset. De Vries isn't even named, Vladimir is evil, but not crazy enough.. no Feyd.

Still, a great movie and can't wait to see more",qd6vqv
hhn60jf,"A lot of characters felt underdeveloped/underused. Liet, Shadout Mapes, Piter de Vries (did they even say his name?), even Thufir. The Mentats hate the Bene Gesserits and it seemed like Thufir actually cared for Jessica in this version. ""My lady..""",qd6vqv
hhlhzpr,"Well, she's still more developed that Harkonnen mentat who could have been played by any no name extra",qd6vqv
hhmchf3,">And while I didn’t dislike movie Liet, she was underdeveloped and I think came and went too quick.

Every character in this movie felt underdeveloped. Maybe Paul is an exception, but the rest of them just showed up and got killed in an hour.",qd6vqv
hhlf6fy,"Liet’s death scene in the book was my favorite scene in the book, the movie version didn’t suck but it was a wasted opportunity.",qd6vqv
hhlzhgh,It seems like a few characters were underdeveloped. I am not sure if anyone not familiar with the story would even know how Piter de Vries is since I am not sure they ever referred to him by name in the movie. Both mentats were kind of underdeveloped really in my opinion.,qd6vqv
hhmi6v8,"Yeah while I like the movie it didn’t develop the world building as much as the books did (like how Arrakis could be turned into a water world and how that affected the Fremen).

Which is understandable, that would add another 30 minutes to a long movie.",qd6vqv
hhm2o3k,For some reason I thought Idris Elba was playing Liet??? Mustve been from a dream or something ha,qd6vqv
hhl8k1i,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhm51j2,Another important aspect of this character in the books...it foreshadows/demonstrates a planetary outsider not just being accepted but rising into leadership within the ranks of the fremen.,qd6vqv
hhptrf8,He was a man in the book right?,qd6vqv
hhmcb38,All of the characters felt undeveloped like that to me.,qd6vqv
hhpqbla,"Yeah, I prefer the way Liet died in the book, but in a movie it would just be someone walking through a desert with heatstroke.",qd6vqv

hhlm7zl,"I thought the character got most of the high points but I feel like the actor didn't really sell the dialogue when she was looking at Paul's stillsuit for the first time. 

Or at least it felt rushed to me.",qd6vqv
hhlabdr,Weird how this film has so many underdeveloped characters.,qd6vqv
hhlb4gk,"I thought they were gonna have her killed in the room at the Ecology Station with the plants, that Idaho is briefly in.  To tie back to her referencing the initial plan of making the world bloom.",qd6vqv
hhlrw8r,">  she was underdeveloped and I think came and went too quick.

I feel this was a trouble with pretty much all the characters (granted, there was so much to set up). For such a long and slower paced movie, it felt like it was fairly rushed at times. I really would wish to see 4h cut.",qd6vqv
hho1ire,"I kinda agree on the first part, but I really hated the Liet death in the book. It was just a manic hallucination that didn't add anything to me personally, it was a drag. At least in the movie (although she died kinda stupidly for a fremen) her death had some meaning — she died serving Shai Hulud and took sardaukars with her. In the book he was left to die in the sands and blew up on some sand-gas, it was kinda  useless.",qd6vqv
hhmcx8t,"I felt the same way. Liet felt half baked and lacked depth in the movie. I'm looking at it as a good movie, but certainly not a book.

I guess a series would have to be made to dive into all the character the development the book manages.",qd6vqv
hhpnz5a,I think having the dinner party would have been perfect. It could have setup the significance of different factions involvement on Arrakis. Kynes really shines having more power than just an Imperial planetologist,qd6vqv
hhpuhan,"Agreed! The thing I miss most from the book death, though, was Liet's last thought - that the worst thing that could happen to the Fremen was a hero.",qd6vqv
hhtpztm,"This is true for a lot of characters in the movie. It starts with a massive cast and quickly knocks 90% off the board without much development compared to the novel. 

Felt like we went through about 3 seasons of GoT with the amount of deaths.",qd6vqv
hhvdvig,"Thuffir will be way underdeveloped as well most likely in part 2. I’m curious if feyd will make an appearance in part 2. I wonder if the plan is to go through a certain number of books or just the first, making a plan of what characters to feature less or even not at all.",qd6vqv
hi36u31,I disliked the actress' performance,qd6vqv
hifjsrt,"She's totally useless in the movie.  The screenplay haphazardly introduces her, gets rid of her, finds her again, and then kills her.  Everything she conveys to the central characters could have been conveyed by Duncan.",qd6vqv

hhrzy7x,"I think there is a lot of stuff that got left on the cutting room floor due to time and pacing concerns.

Usually 1 page in a script = 1 min on screen so you can imagine trying to compress 412 pages of a book into a film script, which you then have to translate into two films.  

412/60=6.86 hours!",qd6vqv

hig68rq,"Beyond the obvious gender-swap, it did feel like her ending was definitely the biggest deviation from the source material as far as characters at least.",qd6vqv
hhp84j0,"I agree, but out of all characters that could be scaled back, Kynes is definitely one of them. I kind of wish we had a bit more Piter De Vries and Thufir Hawat",qd6vqv

hhw41x2,"Yeah, it felt both fast paced and slow paced at the same time, somehow.",qd6vqv
hhlxgy9,"She might have known her chances were slim, yeah.  But she was intending to ride away on the worm, yes.  She’s not the only one who knows how to do that though, so whoever you see at the end is just another Fremen.

hhrumfj,The thought of making my mother cry puts me in a bad place so that was the scene for me.,qd6vqv
hhkxefr,"She definitely is. The book mentions that Bene Gesserit training allows you to achieve full mastery over emotional reactions, right down to bodily functions like heart rate. I get why they did it though - the non-book reading audience doesn't know that and it's hard to convey they have this skill.",qd6vqv
hhlz7o9,"I think without internal monologue, they had to show some contrast between her actual emotions and how she still manages to go straight-face Bene Gesserit when it’s time to control them.",qd6vqv
hhnkqsp,"It was probably to externalize everything that can't be shown from the book.

I would have appreciated to see a scene where she goes from emotion to absolute serenity to display her emotional control from the Bene Gesserit training.",qd6vqv
hhw8fj8,"Honestly I loved the way they portrayed Jessica in the movie. It highlights her character's conflict without having to go into inner-monologue. She is in conflict over her love for Paul as a mother, but also following the Bene Gesserit teachings and plan.",qd6vqv
hhl0g4a,"I feel like she's being portrayed much more weakly and meekly in this adaption than she was in the book.

She's supposed to be a bit of a badass bitch in and of herself, but the only glimpse of that we see is that Leto defers to her in private, and she does kill the Exile Thopter crew. I feel like the rest of the scenes she's just...anxiously watching things happen. Anxious...when Bene Gesserit are supposed to have utmost self-control.",qd6vqv
hhnqj3d,"Ok, so that wasn't my imagination after all  She was *super* emotional",qd6vqv
hhlfbvr,"I agree but actually kept reminding myself a big part of the books was Paul using his training to pick up on his mother's emotions coming through and her training of control of her emotions wavering as she gets weaker with fear for him, his father, and ultimately grief. She can still fight but her emotions of fear, sadness, and grief become much less controlled as they endure more and his becomes better and it's a big role reversal for them. If they included a comment from him about it I think tht would've been portrayed better but they do never directly address it with each other, it's always a personal reflection",qd6vqv
hhr9grq,"I thought so too! I imagined her much more steely. But her internal monologue was full of angst, so I think it was important to show the audience that side. I noticed she always""turned it off"" in front of others (except Paul).",qd6vqv
hhy985x,"That was my only miss too. Everyone else I saw and connected right as I imagined them in the book, but Jessica is crying as she walks around the halls? That’s not how I saw her.",qd6vqv
hhz9kcj,"In the book I remember he being quite reserved but her thoughts were full of panic and worry.  She screams ""Paul!"" a lot and seems to get kind of emotional up to meeting Stilgar and she becomes badass again.  You can't really show the thoughts, so I guess they had to have her act it.",qd6vqv
hhmaf2u,"While I don't think Rebecca did bad at all, I do feel that Jessica as a character had the worst transition from book to film.  

Don't get me wrong, Jessica's personality wore really thin by the end of Dune for me, but she felt like a much stronger character in the books when you could hear her thoughts.",qd6vqv
hhpptf5,"I understand the change, in the book we get to know how she truly feels through her internal monologue. In a movie you can’t do that, so they showed more of her emotions while also at the same time showing her try to control them to hint at her training.",qd6vqv
hi02og0,"Unfortunately it's a visual medium and there's no way to express what's going on emotionally except on the outside, if you aren't gonna beat the audience over the head with some god-awful voiceovers of her internal monologues.",qd6vqv

hhwhlha,Than*,qd6vqv
hiasnft,"Waaaay late to this party but,

In the book, Jessica is very cold, stoic and in control. Externally. Internally, she is fearful and sad for what she feels/knows may be coming and has already come to pass. She has great fear for Paul. All of that is shown through internal dialog that didn't exist in the movie. I'm content with how they showed her softness.",qd6vqv

hhxkjk5,"Hard disagree. For me she was a disappointing lead. Written uninterestingly here, and the performance didn't elevate it. For me it's a bit of a slog watching her talk to her son, with the exception of her yelling at him for bad pitch. Just my opinion though.",qd6vqv
hhpdfaf,"Jessica is confident, seemingly omniscient, and to be feared. In the books, at least. In the movie she just was sad/scared the whole time and had four lines of dialog. When she's sad or scared in the books it *means* something because of how powerful she's characterized. A little disappointing from the movie tbh.",qd6vqv

It's really suttle and maybe im reading too much into that animation but for me it looked that way,qd6vqv

hhx16dx,It won’t. It’s not an actual cut. It’s an assembly.,qd6vqv
hhl5d5b,"Really wish the plotline with Thufir suspecting Jessica of being a spy/assassin was in the film. Builds a lot of tension of an incoming betrayal, layers the Harkonen plot to divert attention within Atreides before their ambush, making her unreliable until it turns out to be Yueh - reaffirming her loyalty and his involvement more shocking. Felt like the attack/reveal was a bit too abrupt and probably stronger in a 3 hour cut.

Totally agree this movie flew by. It's hard to complain considering how much we got and how authentic it is to the book. But it does feel like there's an extended cut worth releasing somewhere out there.",qd6vqv
hhmbgqi,"Also, I was surprised at the lack of talking about water 

They didn’t have lady Jessica’s garden, the water sellers, etc

They also didn’t have Paul giving his dad advice at council.

I also missed the dinner scene with the princess",qd6vqv
hhlzu8y,"There are many novels out there well suited to be adapted to screen. Hell, I feel like the Expanse writers were really just putting down a tv script that happened to be passable as novels. 

Dune on the other hand is just so dense, has so many themes and ideas and a pace that can both jump ahead years and also languish in a scene for many pages explored from multiple characters perspectives. In short, pretty impossible to condense into film.

At first I thought they would be better making this a series, a faithful renactment that the one novel could span 8 seasons of tv. 

But then I noticed (and this may be exacerbated by just recently rereading the book) that I didn't particularly enjoy when they did try to emulate the book word for word, scene for scene. Paul with the gom jabbar and Jessica recanting the littany against fear, I kind of have my own mental viewing of that scene, and weirdly found myself just wanting it to be over. 

No sometimes it's better to be given what we don't know we desire versus what we think we want, and while I thought I wanted 100 hours of Dune to binge I'd probably grow bored of it. 


What I didn't know I desired was a film that is almost a graphic novel, a companion of the book that allows me to get lost in this beautifully realised living breathing world and is close enough to the scene to easily fill in the blanks from memory while different enough to still allow for excitement and suspense. 



In short my experience of book adaptations is that only LOTR didn't ruin my memory of the work but actually elevated it, matching and besting my imagination in parts. Dune now gives it good company, whatever Tolkien had to say about it.",qd6vqv
hhmr4v9,"Kyne's death was badass and one of the better changes, despite being one of the more (if not ""the most"") important scenes in the book. Translated to film, it would just be her shuffling around in the desert muttering to herself about ecology for at least 5 minutes in order to get the point across. I would have loved it but it's not exactly gripping cinema",qd6vqv
hhmc0ea,"It was somehow too drawn out *and* too compressed. They spent way too much time in the lead up to going to Arrakis, and much of what, in the books, was a character's internal monologue was never brought forward in the movie. 

I am not confident someone who was not familiar with the books would be able to really follow what was going on. So much was left unexplained. My opinion only, ofc.",qd6vqv
hhlrt6w,"and Paul being showed how to walk the desert in a video instead of figuring it out and it being like a more common knowledge?!! That was so odd. 

Also Jessica being so, so emotional for being Bene Gesserit (although I suppose they needed some visual cue to her emotions but still..)",qd6vqv
hhm1ct3,"> The only other major difference I noticed was the carry-all actually showing up to save the sand crawler but simply being broken. In the book the carry-all was hijacked by Harkonnen iirc, which helped drive the dinner scene in the book.

I kinda liked that, it's a lot easier for Kynes to plausibly deny that there was any sabotage or foul play.  The carryall being hijacked was clear Harkonnen interference, but the carryall breaking genuinely could have been old equipment just breaking in the harsh environment",qd6vqv

hhnbkfc,"Exactly.

I wish the movie had ended when they fly the orni into the sandstorm and instead they had added 30 mins before that to elaborate all the points you mention.

Hopefully there will be a director's cut or extended edition.",qd6vqv
hhp4huz,"I haven't read the books, but heard that there was gonna be a big betrayal. When it ended up being Yueh I just didn't care at all because he hadn't been in the movie enough for me to care.",qd6vqv
hhp9xm7,"oh they missed quite a bit, and it changes how characters feel. Leto looks naive, yet in the books he is fully aware, and has a plan. In the film it feels like they are on dune for about 2 days, in the books its a longer time, long enough to conduct raids to destroy the harkonnen illegal spice stocks (a reason the baron insists on a massive crackdown later because of the financial ruin he faces). 

the baron does not come across as fiercely intelligent, and one of plot points for later on, the turning of Thrufir is not set up at all here as it is in the books.

The love between jessica and leto is pretty much ignore. in fact jessica looks an emotional wreck for most of the film, something she never comes across as in the book.

mentats are not even mentioned, you just get one scene with thrufir doing something odd with his eyes, when in the books the fact paul is a mentat potential is significant.

perhaps the worst bit is the way they seemed to swap the personalities of duncan and gurney. 

dont get me wrong, I like this film. But I feel they over concentrated on the ""visions"" and left out stuff they really could have put in.",qd6vqv

hhl8he1,"Great world building but ultimately underwhelming because it barely touches the main themes of the book, yet.

hhpffmo,All things considered those parts seem like good candidates for trimming down,qd6vqv
hhpxstq,"Really sad we didn’t get to see the Dinner scene/ Tuek’s introduction. IMO it was pretty pivotal in Paul’s development of leadership skills. It’s how he builds the courage to assert himself as a leader when speaking with Kynes and then later with the Fremen. 

Really curious how a version of the movie that only covered (Roughly) the first 3rd of the book would’ve gone.",qd6vqv
hhpxugw,"IMO I feel the movie covered a lot. I had no idea the movie was only going to cover part 1. Sure it bled into part 2 but still. I thought they were going to cram the entire part 1 in the first 30-45 min.

Mapes literally had the same amount of time. She is a nothing character, people need to stop acting like she had this big role.

I thought the movie was a great visual spectacle, but empty an soulless, with shallow characters I didn't care at all about, which was absolutely not the case when reading the books. The score assisted in the overall blandness, since much of it felt like it could have been cop-pasted into any Marvel superhero movie and didn't raise any themes or emotion. Pretty poor movie when I think about it, aside from the visuals and the spectacle of it all, a few scenes excepted.",qd6vqv

But Duncan was more loose and personable and Gurney was more by-the-book. Duncan gets sent out on a diplomatic mission, Gurney was always by Leto's side (and was repeatedly shown to be the first person to draw a weapon in his defense).

At the end of the day the story is about a mother and her only child and the weight of all she put on him coming to fruition as she watches it develop in horrifically painful ways and the reality sets in of what she has done and how her goals must come to pass; with a coming of age tale in the backdrop of high intelligence/perception/political intrigue/and unlocking the horrible and terrible truths of humanity and life forces of the universe. And THAT the movie portrayed very well and stayed very true to.

Jason Mamoa feels like one of those actors.  He's not a chameleon like, say, Gary Oldman.  He's not a character actor.  When you're watching Jason Momoa you know you're watching Jason Momoa.

hhl2mlf,"> the weight of water and what Dune could be is THE pillar of the book and missing from this film

Totally agree! I also agree that the mentat and to some extent the Bene Gesserit training was glossed over. My favorite part of the books was the idea that this wasn’t “magic”… just heightened awareness. Made it very different than a standard fantasy novel because the supernatural abilities had to do with training (and eugenics ugh so that part is maybe better left out). 

But it’s a different concept than Harry Potter waving a wand or Luke moving a ship, and thar wasn’t really explained in the movie.",qd6vqv
hhmicbr,"> the weight of water and what Dune could be is THE pillar of the book and missing from this film

The water discipline is disappointing, but I could forgive it.

For me, the larger omission was the lack of Bene Gesserit shadowplay.

Paul leans into the 'prophecy' a bit in his convo with Kiet Lynes - but I wanted to see more of the concept that the BG were sewing seeds of prophecy throughout the land to help their sisters in times of need.

Yes - Paul ultimately fulfills the prophecy - but Jessica/Paul both get out of some very hairy situations because of their ability to compute and decide what the best decision is *in that moment based on the training of the Bene Gesserit* and thats what whips the 'holy war' into a frenzy.

Right now - there's no reason to think these Fremen would suddenly follow Paul unless there is a HUGE focus on *why* Paul is so important to the Fremen belief system - he is the culmination of a thousand years of religious grooming by the Bene Gesserit.",qd6vqv
hhlzcuh,"I mean, ecology is definitely 100% a massive part of the Dune story, but its not the main theme. 


The main theme is about charismatic leaders being given so much centralized power that it destroys humanity. Whether from outside forces destroying a weakened humanity, or from within. 


Paul's story is that he's born with immense power and trained as a Mentats as well as undergone the water of life ritual of the Fremen. That means that he can view the genetic memory of every human ever, he can see all possible outcomes of the future, and when he decides on a future it locks everyone into that decision. 


This movie's story is about how he understands that the Fremen have already been manipulated into believing he's a Messiah, but instead of accepting a path where he helps the Fremen, he takes the selfish path where he himself manipulates them and controls them to become Emperor. He doesn't understand the consequences of his Prescience, and it costs humanity billions of lives.",qd6vqv
hhm55l0,"It's why this always needed to be three movies. There's just a lot of stuff I got due to reading the book. But a lot of world building and character beats were cut out. This first part of the book is so dense in that stuff it makes it hard to adapt.

hhlz0le,">the dinner party scene (what is it with movie adaptations and not having this scene?) 

IMO this scene is borderline unfilmable so I get it.  The people in the dinner party are all incredibly highly trained political operatives that are all trying to read each other's intentions and plans by picking up on the tiniest physical cues and conversational tells.  

It's an amazing scene in the book because you can get all those internal monologues revealing what everyone is thinking, but on the outside its just a pretty boring dinner party.  If the characters actually do anything obvious for the benefit of the audience, the subtlety of the scene is lost.  I think it's kind of a lose/lose",qd6vqv
hhm1hr2,"I fully agree with your critiques. However, I'd bet that many points (some too late to rectify) can and I assume will be hammered harder in Part 2. The ecology for sure, and there are many opportunities to further explain mentats. It should've and could've been done in this movie, but at 2.5 hours already, I can angrily understand why they didn't include stuff",qd6vqv

hhqvxqy,"One other departure from the books is the scene where Paul is shown in the practice fight with Gurney Halleck (as opposed to Thufir in the books) and Gurney adopts Thufir's line of warning Paul to not sit with his back to the door.

This I felt was a bit of a shame as it was up to Thufir to provide security for the Atreides (as he had done for the previous Duke as well), and it was his back faced towards traitors behind him, figuratively speaking, and thus failing the family in that way.

In addition Paul is also meant to be trained as a Mentat by Thufir, so we missed out on this. Hope we get to see much more of Thufir in the next movie, especially his interactions with Vladimir Harkonnen.",qd6vqv
hhl5r9u,"The movie is gorgeous and you can tell it has so much work that went into it, but it’s really … bland. It’s just not all that engaging to watch and obviously was better done as a high budget streaming series, not full length movies",qd6vqv

hhp8kjb,"> what is it with movie adaptations and not having this scene?

Because it doesn’t accomplish much on a movie’s time budget. As interesting as it is, it won’t move the plot forward enough to warrant keeping it.

It’s part of the reason why I think the story would work better as a tv series than as a movie. You don’t have to move the plot forward as fast, which helps for stories like this.",qd6vqv
hhlyz8j,"Personally I think you’re being too harsh, books will always be able to go more in depth simply because of timing. Movies have to follow a certain flow for audiences to stay interested, books don’t worry about that.

All of those characters, while impactful, don’t really need to be told to progress the story, not as much as what we did see. The only one that might have been needed is Liet, but for all we know they will go more into the Fremen Dream in the next movie, they should have more time to explore themes based on where the 1st ended.

I think the only way it could have been better was if it was a TV show, but then there would have been major issues with matching the scale and scope of the world they were trying to build",qd6vqv
hhll912,"> Yueh is introduced what, once before his betrayal?

Twice. Following the idea that the third time you encounter something you can expect a change. Also, if they did it your way you'd expect the betrayal. This way it was actually a surprise since it could have been anyone to someone who didn't know the book.

My dumb ass thought it could have been a lot of people, including Paul's mother.

>Liet. Liet’s character thrives on his/her ecological hope for Dune and the paradise it could be. Liet also needs to be won over. By removing the dinner party scene (what is it with movie adaptations and not having this scene?) we don’t get the exchange about terraforming Dune, and also the respect Liet developed when the Duke decides not to waste the water. The ecological stuff is super briefly alluded to in Paul’s film early on and then in the weather station, but to me the weight of water and what Dune could be is THE pillar of the book and missing from this film

I feel like that was there, imho, but I'm sure more would have been fun.

>Mentat’s. Is the word mentat said once in the film? Paul is a mentat for crying out loud! It’s not just his mother who made him what he is. Leto had a role in that too. I get that the movie and story can proceed without this, but it feels like a corner cut, and with the other two points I mentioned above, it lends to a greater sense of emptiness.

No, that didn't seem too evident, I agree. Only Thufir seemed to be that.

>Shadout Mapes. Another small corner cut that I think lends to my general misgivings. She is just there to be chosen and give Jessica the Crysknife, then next she’s dead. She and Kynes both need to be observers to the Atreides and be the reader/viewers stand-in for the Fremen as they slowly realize who Paul is.

Eh, they both do that in their core observations. Particularly Kynes.",qd6vqv
hho7zkx,"You are disappointed that a movie attempting to adapt a notoriously difficult book cut Mentats?!  Their entire concept is only relevant if you understand a lot of back-story and history of Dune (Butlerian Jihad, AI etc.).  Yes, it definitely has more exposition in the book, but it's a bit secondary to the movie's main plotline, which is Paul's growth from a young heir into what he becomes.

How much time would you dedicate to Mentats in a story like this?  Conveying math as a concept on-screen is almost impossible.  Take a look at Foundation in AppleTV for a ridiculous attempt at doing just that.  Villeneuve was smart to not go down that road.

Shadout Mapes also doesn't need much screen time.  I do agree that the initial scene with her and Jessica was a bit rough though and maybe you add 2-3 more minutes to who she is and her backstory.  But that's it.

The Yueh storyline was handled well too, since the entire focus of this movie was on Paul and his relationship with both his father, his mother and Dune itself.  As a screenplay, I see no need to spend too much time on him since he's just there to move the plot forward so Paul and Jessica (the main focus of the second half of the movie) can escape and begin their journey.

I mean, the movie was pretty good and the only issue I have with it is 

* Jason Mamoa - totally miscast.  he plays himself.
* Probably 1 or 2 too many dreamy Zendaya sequences.
* Not enough backstory on the Harkonnens ... I think we get that in the next movie

hhnwk58,Exactly. The harsh environment and brutal training turned them into a warrior cult dedicated to the Emperor.,qd6vqv
hit3qrz,"From the Glossary:

>SARDAUKAR: the soldier-fanatics of the Padishah Emperor. They were
men from an environmental background of such ferocity that it killed six out of
thirteen persons before the age of eleven. Their military training emphasized
ruthlessness and a near-suicidal disregard for personal safety. They were taught
from infancy to use cruelty as a standard weapon, weakening opponents with
terror.  At  the  apex  of  their  sway  over  the  affairs  of  the  Universe,  their
swordsmanship was said to match that of the Ginaz tenth level and their cunning
abilities at in-fighting were reputed to approach those of a Bene Gesserit adept.
Any one of them was rated a match for any ten ordinary Landsraad military
conscripts. By the time of Shaddam IV, while they were still formidable, their
strength had been sapped by overconfidence, and the sustaining mystique of
their warrior religion had been deeply undermined by cynicism.",qd6vqv
hih5ptm,"One thing I was disappointed about was how generic the Sardaukar outfits were. I thought since they were fanatics, and they seemed kinda self-obsessed, and they only really needed the shields for protection, that their uniforms would be fucking crazy like Warhammer 40k space marines but even less practical and more capes and spikes and warpaint. Instead they were in like white motorcycle crash suits.",qd6vqv

hhkrgdq,When the Imperial Herald arrived Duke Leto asked Thufir how much that space flight must have cost. His eyes turned white as the calculated.,qd6vqv
hhyzstb,"No offense meant here but honestly, if your friend needed even half of that stuff pointed out to him was he even thinking about what was happening in in the movie at all? Sure some of it might not have been totally clear but half of the stuff you mentioned isn't that confusing.

The goal of Kynes was all but outright stated. Recovery of the water from the body of Jamis is telegraphed a mile off, the next movie will start with the funeral. It's a movie about nobility, that the Duke never married Jessica isn't that shocking.

I've never read the books either but c'mon man.",qd6vqv
hhr5sia,"I watched it again at home. Yes, for someone who was supposedly trained, Jessica was a train wreck. As for shit dialogue, agreed: Duke Leto's *""Give it a try""* would never have come from Frank Herbert.

Please bear in mind getting people in theatres means we *might* get to see Part 2. So they had to dumb it down to some extent to give it some kind of mass appeal. Yes, this would be great as a miniseries but look at the shitshow that is Apple's ""Foundation"".",qd6vqv
hhko6un,"plus she's technically not allowed to give him a son, and making sons is one of the primary duties of a noble.   Sure, Jessica breaks the rules, but that's a big shocking deal in their world.  Bene Gesserit are made for a purpose, and it's not marrying.",qd6vqv
hhkybcu,">! Also , it was more or less Jessica’s idea that the Duke must remain unmarried to leave this option open. In the book they have a scene where Jessica explain to Gurney how she could’ve easily make the Duke marry her , but out of her own devotion to Leto she choose not to do that !<",qd6vqv
hhktfpi,History will remember us as wives,qd6vqv

hhksqgu,I still don’t know what half of this means.... but it’s all so enticing to find out,qd6vqv
hhps3vt,I think the biggest part is just that Leto is playing a lot of political games. His hand in marriage is a valuable asset to promise another house and he wants to keep that available to him. Marrying Jessica might be a tiny scandal but not serious enough to stop Leto from doing it.,qd6vqv
hhkxa7t,This dynamic also becomes extremely important for the end of Part Two (assuming it gets made),qd6vqv

It gets even worse later on with Paul",qd6vqv

""No, son, I loved your father, but he had to remain eligible for political alliances"".   I mean...it's right there in this movie already with Paul jumping at the chance to hook it up with the Imperial princesses.  

They just oddly shy away from really mentioning this for Leto & Jessica.",qd6vqv

hhnp2tm,"Dude, have they heard her sing in the Greatest Showman? You marry a woman like that.",qd6vqv
hhp5tq9,"Just to add on, it’s worth noting that Leto also wanted to keep himself available to potential suitors in his potential pursuit of the throne or alliances with other houses. He never intended to act on them but he wanted them to know the possibility was there so it may affect political deals.",qd6vqv

hiu254t,"Conversations between the Atreides family and people living in Arakeen (the town on Arrakis their palace is in, although I might have the name wrong), including Kynes the ecologist, a smuggler leader, someone who controls the water supply I think, and some other people. It really added a lot of context to their situation there. There was also some other stuff that took place entirely within the characters' heads. While that would've been hard to adapt, the conversations I think would've added to the movie, and as it was in the book, slowed the plot down so that you can learn more about the characters' intentions. 

MILD SPOILER (I haven't read more than the first book)

There's a conversation between Kynes the ecologist, Jessica, and the guy who controls the water (or just sells it I can't remember) about Jessica and the Atreides' intent for enriching the lives of the Fremen and the other locals through building a natural water supply over the long course of time. That's when it clicked for me that Kynes was on their side, despite being the Imperial Ecologist. Overall, it was cut and it still makes sense, but I hope they circle back around to including more of the ecological themes of the book, even if it done in a completely different way to the book.",qd6vqv

Funnily enough, I have said for years that the loudest movie I've ever seen is Blade Runner 2049. When that parked car gets shot at and explodes is the loudest moment I have ever heard in a theater.

Dune now holds that record, and there are too many moments to consider to be the loudest part.And I mean this all in the best way possible.

When arguing between IMAX and Prime, I like to say ""I don't want the seats to rumble. I want the seats to rumble because of the speakers pointed at it.""",qd6vqv

The faster something interfaces with it the harder it’s repelled.

The swords would deflect on a hard swing, but in close quarters one can bind and drive the blade through.",qd6vqv
hhkqlzn,"Shields are mostly meant to protect against fast-moving projectiles, which is why guns aren't as effective in the Dune universe anymore (mostly).

hhkml0g,"The swords swing fast to get to the shield, but once you get to it, you move slowly through the barrier to hit your target.",qd6vqv
hhkn69h,It's just a failure of choreography then. The idea is that they swing as fast as they need to get past defenses then slow down right before they hit the shield. With the frenetic choreography it may be hard to see.,qd6vqv

hhl1ibr,"I did feel the fight choreography was off for the portrayal of these shields.  As others have stated, it's a speed thing.  Anything under the speed of, say, a slow punch, would penetrate. This would prevent any substantial projectiles from getting through.  It's what allows them to grab their own knives and breathe and such.  

I don't know that it was very well executed in these fights, as it just seemed to be a ""Duncan's blade can go through anything it likes"".  I might be mollified by just believing that stabbing motions can get through while slashing motions cannot, in this movie portrayal.  

The darts were never used in the books, so I'm not sure why they were developed for this movie.  I don't understand what concept they're going for that a dart can continue propelling itself when stopped by the shield.  They did not seem to have any chemical propulsion.",qd6vqv
hhm81p3,I think the best sword users go super fast until the last second then slow down enough to get through the shield,qd6vqv
hhpqbx3,"If you watch closely, almost every killing blow delivered in a shielded knife fight in this is slowed at the last second. Which is how they train to fight. Move fast to keep your opponent off guard, and use that speed to get the blade into position on the edge of the shield and then slow to just enough force to penetrate the shield. Once the edge is in the shield you can deliver more force to make it a killing blow.

In the same vein, the most effective killing move is going for the throat because it requires the least amount of force once through the shield.",qd6vqv
hhkmokq,It seems to stop high velocity objects like bullets. I don't think you can swing a sword at a high enough velocity to meet the threshold.,qd6vqv

hhmftd4,"Not sure why you were downvoted. Those are good questions.

1. The politics of Dune is complicated and trying to explain it in a two-hour film would be a bad idea. There is essentially a triumvirate in place: the Padishah Emperor who rules, the Spacing Guild who provides interstellar travel, and the Landsraad which are the feudal great houses like the Atreides. If you're interested in this, you should read the book.

2. I don't think there's anything explicit in the book about race at all, but it's always been assumed that nobles are Caucasian and Fremen are not. Part of this may stem from their religions. The Fremen clearly have Islamic influences in their culture, and Herbert modeled the story partly after T.E. Lawrence. It would have been really interesting if Denis had chosen to make the Atreides into something other than a stereotypical white ruling class.

3. The empire has reverted to a standard feudal system, but now a interplanetary one. The Bene Gesserit are composed only of women, but they are working behind the political scene to advance their own agenda. I don't think Herbert gave the issue of gender roles much thought and that might be the best answer to the question.

4. Jessica isn't as emotional in the book. Her inner conflict is largely communicated to the reader through internal monologues. I don't think Denis wanted voiceovers, so he had to communicate this to the audience in some other way.",qd6vqv
hhmkfm7,"for your point 2, it's not that there's white people ruling dark people - in the book race isn't even mentioned at all - it's locals vs. people who want their resources (colonialism). When you think about the industrial planet of Geidi Prime or cloudy/rainy planet of Caladan vs. desert Arrakis, it just makes sense that their skin colors lean the way it did. In other versions the Fremen are white.",qd6vqv
hhptsdq,"Frank Herbert wrote the novels as a deconstruction of neocolonialism/imperialism. The spice represents oil, and the Fremen are modeled on Middle Eastern cultures and religion. So yes, it is about white people coming in and taking wealth from indigenous people.",qd6vqv
hi7wb6h,"The others have weighed in very handily, but one correction here. Dune is not based 8000 years in the future. It's based in 10191 AG, not AD.

[This wiki](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Universal_Standard_Calendar) does some math which I don't get and estimates 10191 AG to be somewhere between 21,267 AD to 21,667 AD. There's [more debate here though](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/110463/in-dune-when-is-the-year-10191) that pushes this date further out to 26,000 AD",qd6vqv

Duke Leto Atreides was very popular in the Landsraad, and this was a threat to the Emperor's power, even if only imagined. Atreides troops were also very well trained, and were nearly a match for the Sardaukar, who are the best fighting force known. This led to the Emperor needing to get rid of a rival so he wouldn't be deposed. 

The Bene Gesserit are political masterminds. They work for all the major leaders, providing advice and training to nobles and their heirs.

To fit the book into a movie Villenueve seems to have dumped the explanation of how all these 'powers' and mysticism are science instead of magic/spirituality/the Force.  So the movie isn't explaining (yet?) why and how different people can better extrapolate vast knowledge from the past to closer pinpoint actual predictions of the future.  Predictions so complex they arrive as prescient visions.  Oh, and this is a consequence of banning AIs 10,000 years ago.

Actually my only regret about the film is that it doesn't do something like a Star Wars Foreword to explain the ban on AI and why 10,000 years of scientific bioengineering/advanced psychology/advanced training and use of designed advanced psychoactives lead to humans not only replacing computers, but having powers that look like magic and visions.  The whole Other Memory thing dependant on genes. Perfect past knowledge leading to extrapolations forward that lead to prescience... dependant on individual talent and training.

hhomfik,"Yeah Lynch only hand-waved it, but at least he made mention of it at all. 

If I have one major complaint about this film it's that Denis just seems allergic to exposition and avoids it wherever he can, but how are you supposed to convey information to the viewer?

The fact that the Bene Gedsserit litany against fear isn't etched into everyone's cultural memory is evidence of that.

So much focus in the visions show Zendaya and I just kept thinking, “so what?” I have no reason to find her significant beyond her repetitious visions. This thread seems very positive on the film.

hhn3ne1,"Yeah I remember that scene and agree the Sardaukar clean out the Atreides super fast but it kind of feels like they just got the jump on them rather than any supersoldier type of thing.

My FAVORITE Sardaukar thing in Dune is how incredulous everyone is when the Fremen are able to beat them.  It only works if you put that effort in to establish that the Sardaukar are unbeatable but the payoff is so great when you get random Fremen saying things like ""oh yeah those Sardaukar are good, we only captured a few of them"" and everyone else is stunned into silence that somebody has managed to take Sardaukar alive.

Really hoping for some moments like that in part 2",qd6vqv

hjzznhm,"> One thing you didn't mention was the whole deal about space travel in Dune's world being absurdly expensive, and the idea of a warship fleet arriving simultaneously on a planet would've been unheard of. I didn't know this, the movie didn't explain it at any moment prior to or during the attack... a passing mention by the Baron of the attack's expense in his final scene of the movie is like 1.5 hours too late. 

Actually there's a quick scene early on during Leto's acceptance of Arrakis/Dune where the Duke speculates on the enormous cost of transporting all those people, and the mentat Thurfir Hawat's eyeballs go white and he gives an apparently outrageous number.",qd6vqv
hk0j5rf,"> Hit the nail on the head with this. I was looking for words for how to describe how those scenes played out for me and I think this is it, (although I'd argue Duncan's scene in particular was pretty horrible for more reasons than this.) I also felt the disconnect with Paul's fight against Jamis. Not a movie-ruiner for sure but definitely odd.

Disconnect is a good word for it.  At times, when the action or moment seems like it should call us in, either through overly formal camerawork, or bad staging/choreography, or *something,* I'm not in the moment with the character the way I feel I should be.  As it happens more than once, I have to wonder if it's intentional and maybe just doesn't work for me.",qd6vqv
hhpmvpn,"Same experience.  I've read the book and my wife hasn't.  I enjoyed the movie, but the whole time I assumed my wife was not following it and not enjoying it.  When it was over I asked her and she liked it and said she was able to follow no problem.

It might have helped we watched with subtitles.  Reading all the proper nouns makes them easier to follow.",qd6vqv

In my mind, the character's seem emotionally distant and a little off because they are so far in the future that their culture and mannerisms seems alien to us.

I would agree that they should add a little more emotional impact, though. I think that will come in part 2.",qd6vqv

The part that confused me is how the dart penetrates the shield, seemingly incapacitating Leto as it works its way in. There's clearly some sort of kinetic energy transfer in the shields where even non-lethal blows still knock someone off balance, so why not just use projectiles and firearms to overwhelm someone? I feel like a shotgun blast to the torso will still knock someone clean off their feet. Sharp projectiles were also shown to penetrate the shield.

Just a small nitpick - otherwise I felt the shields were portrayed very well, and even for my minor criticism I can buy how blades are the primary weapon of choice.",qd6vqv
hjzo3nk,"I haven't read the books but if all this is true, this movie *desperately* needed this explained like WAY more obviously, and prior to the attack not after.

Denis has to know that movies like Star Wars, where fleets of ships move around like nothing, is engrained in the audience's mind, and he will need to counter that hard.

There was lots I liked about Dune, including stuff that some of the folks who didn't like it are complaining about. I liked the sparse, muted-colored settings and alien, passionless-ness of the humans... it created this bleak, uninviting world that separated my experience of it from more traditional epics.

But damn I absolutely hated this movie from about the doctor's betrayal reveal up until Paul/Jessica flying into the storm (which was a great scene). I didn't get how the hell this level of destruction was happening so quickly into the Duke's tenure on arrakis. It felt rushed, totally unexplained, Duncan's last stand was just a pathetic fight sequence for multiple reasons, and no protection seemingly anywhere for the house heads despite previously depicting Atreides as a highly structured, devoted culture. The whole midsection was just a mess, and this knowledge would've helped with a good bit of these problems.",qd6vqv
hjypb0d,"Even so in the movie you see that the air defense guns only start firing a while after the ships have already arrived, and also whoever was supposed to be maintaining the shields and managing all that (which I imagine would be a whole section at least) did not notice at all that the doctor let the shields down.

I never read the books so I agree with everything you said, but still the way the movie portrays it the Atreites were not prepared for one ship attacking them let alone a whole fleet. They got lucky that the Harkonnen didn't start off just destroying everything outside of the palace with orbital weapons and then landing and securing the boy.",qd6vqv

hibcprv,"> I think the movie looked good but everything felt bland.

Pretty certain that is by design.  The society described in Dune is feudalistic, i.e. high conformity, everyone's a soldier or a knight, the more flourishes you add to the architecture the more opportunities you have to hide something in a curtain somewhere.  So, everything is bland like a military base.  Military bases are EXTREMELY

Part of why I think a lot of people really enjoyed this is that the movie didn't hold your hand in the same way that the book doesn't hold your hand either.

That works for me personally, since to me that's what film does best. The complete narrative of Dune is already out there. If I wanted to experience that narrative in its most complete and unadulterated form, I'd read the book again. But that's not why I go to movies.

I feel like people were expecting something akin to an HBO series, not an actual movie. Plot is for television, not a visual medium like film, which does a much better job of conveying emotion through image and sound.",qd6vqv

Thump.

Villeneuve is today's Nolan, the ""serious"" option for people that watch disneys.

hhng5v1,"I mean, that's basically pretty faithful to the books. it's a very harsh and unforgiving world, and everyone is on edge constantly. it's not really meant to be some happy fantasy tale, it's almost more like a sci fi horror movie",qd6vqv
hhru2sm,"A massive part of Paul's character is him struggling to retain his humanity, and Chani is very instrumental to that. House Atreides is really the only group that seems to have human characters; the rest have become so distorted, whether by the Bene Gesserit's eugenics program, the overuse of spice, Mentat education, or training that takes them to the brink of death, that they lack empathy and are basically all monsters. 

They did a good job with Idaho, Leto, and Jessica IMO, but Gurney is one of the best examples of this in the book and he got a lot of stuff cut. Yueh's motivation remained but he similarly lost a lot of his humanity on the cutting room floor. Thufir Hawat is just forgotten about which is understandable, as his role in the first half of the book could have easily been filled by Idaho or Gurney except for a) the need to introduce Mentats, and b) his role later on in the book.",qd6vqv
hhl35tc,Your assessment is 100% correct. This is why the comparison with LOTR and Star Wars just baffles me. Especially Star Wars is like the exact opposite of Dune.,qd6vqv
hhl6gk1,"Dune is about bewaring of charismatic leaders and ultimate power, not honoring it.",qd6vqv

There's a time skip and they fight back at some point, but that can be adapted in many different ways.

hhyw35c,"Yeah I think that's just it - the same reason they dont use the word ""jihad"".  Calling her his concubine would've been problematic.

hhkn9ju,"The tension is clear in the last scene, but I’m talking about when they’re undressing on the cliff",qd6vqv
hhkwnkf,I think it’s the way the scene was shot and maybe an acting miscue that tricks us to think the sexual tension. A woman starting to get undressed with her back to man is a common trope.,qd6vqv
hhkt5pq,"There is absolutely zero sexual tension in the books. That undressing glance threw me too. I think the director just messed up - it's supposed to be her worrying about him, or her realizing he has grown up and taken initiative, or some other metaphor, but the fact that he was undressing absolutely implies something sexual. Poor timing to show a ""worried backwards glance"".",qd6vqv

One scene that exemplified Chalamet's mastery of microexpressions is the scene where he keeps his hand in the box. The way he speaks to Gaius Helen Mohiam is particularly challenging in that conflicting thoughts and emotions must be conveyed.

During the movie, I anticipated that some people are going to think that Chalamet was too stoic, especially with some of his interactions with other characters. I thought they were natural given the context.

Good actors essentially build up a psychological profile: What beliefs motivate this character? What was this character's history that shaped the way the character responds emotionally? Etc. That's why good acting is fundamentally theory of mind, not empathy: The former informs and guides the latter, not the other way around.

I mean I get it… it’s a desert planet, but I just felt like something could’ve been done to liven it up a little. I even thought stuff like the costumes were poorly done… sure, a handful of them looked cool, but many times throughout the movie I couldn’t tell which side was which, the looks were so similar. Also, I definitely didn’t go to this movie just to see Zendaya but in retrospect the marketing campaign was quite misleading and I can see why some people who DID go to the theater to see Zendaya are upset. All in all, all I really want out of a movie is for there to be interesting characters with a relatable emotional drive propelling them through a clear and coherent story, and this delivered on none of those fronts… at least for me personally.

My qualm is just with how its just Mandarin, just that one time.  Its 8000 years into the future and human culture has completely mixed together and evolved beyond present-day cultural distinctions.  How many languages from 8000 years ago are still spoken in a recognizeable form today?  There are other languages in the movie, but they're made up - they evolved *out of* a single human lingua franca (English, by convention, though the trope is always ""we just hear it that way as the audience"").  And Herbert made every single cultural element in the book an amalgamation of cultures from around the world.  Its clear that we're supposed to see this as a wholly post-modern world, one where today's ethnic and racial and cultural distinctions have entirely lost their meaning.

hiljji4,"That's not true at all because under feudalism you didn't have standing armies and highly advanced weaponry. 

Feudalism came about because the economic system was dependant upon agrarian farmers and was interwoven with Christianity. 

The Dune religion, as far as it exists on screen isn't a mass movement, but some sort of shadow cult and a power behind the scenes. They are genetically breeding their messiah and we have evidence of his abilities, so their is no doubt or tension with the result. 

I pointed out how Game of Thrones builds this kind of world, but makes the people within it actually real. They fight, they fuck, they plot, they scheme, they drink, they eat, they shit, they die, etc, etc. 

Nobody in Dune can be said to be a fully realized person. 

Why is the Duke out flying and rescuing people if their social structure is feudal and so dependant on him and his family. 

Why is the 'villian' saying his bloodline will end when two people (a father and son) die? That's their family? No brothers, Uncles, Cousins? 

Nothing in Dune is alive and nobody has any desire beyond the immediacy of mining spice on a foreign planet. 

As another example, there is no intimacy or emotion between Oscar Issacs and his 'concubine'; why does he even have a concubine? Where is his wife? Why isn't he married and why doesn't he have more children? Could you imagine those two fucking? I'm not being crude, but they show no emotional attachment to one and other throughout the film and barely consult each other about their private drives. The husband has a new planet to run, the concubine has a prophecy to pursue. Is he even aware of what she is up to?

Looking at Europe for 10 seconds doesn't answer any of my points actually. Europe was alive and driven by the personalities of those in power. One of the biggest events in English history was driven by a King's desire for an heir and lust for a woman/women (Henry VIII and the English conversion to Protestantism). The dynasties in Dune don't work on a functional level. They lack a formal structure at times when the father and son mingle easily with those they rule, yet equally, their soldiers seem heavily ideologically invested in their well being ... why? There is no basis for it. 

The characters in this movie are asexual, emotionally numb robots and their entire existence seems to be devoid of any kind of character or culture.

hiulp77,"You are missing the point.

Game of Thrones is essentially the golden standard for modern-day world building and development of the relationships between characters.

The guy above you is right - movies like Star Wars and LotR work in the constraints of telling a story over 5-10hrs because the enemy is absolute evil and you only have to develop a quarter of the relationships that you'd have to think about if everybody could meaningfully interact.

In this movie we're talking about, there are 3 ""houses"" that we know of - the Emperor, the Duke's and the Baron's. Yet, the conflict between them is not properly fleshed out, nor is it clear why the specific conflict that the Emperor set in motion was needed, or not avoided by the Duke. If the downfall of the Duke on Arrakas was so swift and so inevitable, why did he jump so quickly into it? Is he stupid? Or inept? What fault of the character attributed to his downfall?

Compare this to game of thrones. Over 9 episodes we have a fleshed out conflicts and alliances chart, as well as what the foreseeable consequences of each action could be. Ned Stark dies because... he was a man of honor instead of a man of ruthless determination.

You can write fiction and make movies in which the conflicts are not fleshed out and the winners and losers in those conflicts are seemingly dictated by the plot rather than in-universe reasoning. It is however inferior fiction, and that's what the guy above you (and I) is calling out.",qd6vqv

There should've been so much more tension in the scene after the box. Making it obvious that the Bene Gesserit are a political powerhouse without showing it to most others.

hi98wsj,"Thank you for your answer, that's a really thought-out answer.

I think that movies in series should still tell a complete story in each episode (for lack of a better term), and then you string them together to show an entire narrative arc. We all understand from the very beginning that film must take liberties from the literature. If you have the freedom to deviate from the book in other satisfying ways, then you can adjust the story a small amount to at least show some relatable character development. Not saying there is zero character development, but what is there does not constitute enough to justify the 155-minute runtime.

I don't think putting all of the answers in the second film was a good idea. You could put the big ones there, you could put the biggest cliffhangers there. But the ending was entirely dissatisfying and to tell me I sat through that 2:35 film to learn *background information* for the next several just makes me wish I had waited until they're all out.

I maybe would have liked it if it took the time to really explain the universe and the characters. It felt like I was just dropped into into something that I was expected to know about. Like the movie is set so far in the future so why is the technology seemingly so limited? I don't believe this was addressed at all and I find that bizarre.

It's weird though because the film spent so much time explaining certain things but then completely glossed over other aspects which you would think would be more important. So much information about the sandworm and so little about the core narrative of the film which you mention.

I don't need every scene to be a narrative exposition dump but I certainly would have liked a more extensive introduction sequence akin to LOTR and less glossing over of important plot points. Then just much better characterization in general. So many deaths in this movie but I didn't feel a thing for anyone.",qd6vqv

The pace especially in the beginning was simultaneously too fast and too slow. The action scenes feel like they have no weight because the characters are underdeveloped. The attack by the Harkonnens should feel like the Red Wedding, but it happens so suddenly you don't really feel the same emotion or shock. Mostly the fault of a movie vs TV format.

I think part 2 could be a lot better, now that the setup is out of the way, most of the characters are established, and the direction of the plot is relatively clear. Part 1 felt like a mishmash of random scenes with no clear direction or goal. Fun to look at for sure, but not really mentally stimulating.

hisnfvx,"You touched an important point.

I think the main problem I see is that the movie seems to ignore the fundamental differences between the medium of the source material (literature) and the adaptation (film).

In a book, you can have a dense paragraph describing some complex historical event between a bunch of made up people in made up worlds. The reader can take it in, come back to it when needed.

Also, literature is a very redundant language by nature - after a dozen pages you've already read the names of a few characters and locations several times. Otherwise the reader doesn't know how/what each part is about.

A film is a very different medium. There is usually no need to have a narrator saying ""Bob arrives from Chicago and sees John holding the guitar he had stolen from him."". You just show it happening, and trust the viewer will recognize each character, what they had been doing etc.

So.many people think a movie adaptation is just ""filming the book"". When it really requires so much more.

hisb0c7,"Yeah, I know. It says so in the very beginning right?

My post isn't about that though. I didn't mean incomplete length wise. I mean the movie feels incomplete throughout (if you haven't read the book).

Star Wars at least had that huge scrolling text in the beginning to give some context. Not a great solution, but better than nothing...

Or maybe it's just me. Would be curious if others who also came in blind had the same perception.

(The fact it's ALSO incolmplete length wise makes it even worse for me,.for different reasons.)",qd6vqv
hivcdls,"Possibly. But I think my point still stands.

As I explained in another comment here, it's not that I didn't understand what was presented to me. The issue is lack of context/development/depth (which readers already have from the book, but is not present in the movie).

I'll give you an example. Here is a (very) short story, told in three lines:
- Cribulon was threatened by Blurbo, so she asked Bob for help.
- Bob told her he'd take care of the Blurbo.
- Bob took care of the Blurbo and Cribulon was glad.

If you read that, everything makes sense. Still, there's a lot missing. Who is Cribulon? Why should we care about her? Why did Bob help her? What were the stakes? Etc. 

Of course, my example above is very extreme. But the problem exemplified there is exactly what some of us (who didnt read the book) felt watching Dune.",qd6vqv

hhmu59w,"For sure, it's mentioned or shown numerous times. But when you read the books, Herbert emphasizes the preciousness of water and the importance of conserving it repeatedly. I understand that some things have to be cut out to fit the important things into the movie. So they ended up showing it more instead of spending time ensuring the viewer feels it and understand it the way Herbert intended. Not a big deal, really. They may have simply pushed that off to the second movie. I guess for someone who doesn't know the books, them neatly wrapping and carrying Jamis's body in the final scene is an interesting cliffhanger. They never address why, though readers obviously know. Hopefully they don't rush through it in Part 2 (there better be a Part 2...).",qd6vqv

hi5ot01,"Throughout the movie Paul sees visions of possible futures with the Fremen. Chani killing him, Jamis killing him, Jamis (the friend) teaching him the ways of the desert and so on.

hi8uybm,Ohhh... I must have missed that! Makes sense.,qd6vqv

hhxg83f,"So flat, and the script didn't help. It was serviceable at best. So add in his performance where he didn't have any place to pull from inside of him and its a recipe for a noncharismatic lead.",qd6vqv
hnyvsfc,"Could have cut out a few of the long, panning desert shots and replaced them with a modicum of character depth. I'm not saying I wanted to see every single beat recreated from the book, but like...they could have at least spent a couple minutes fleshing Yueh out, so that when he actually betrayed the Atredies it might have meant something. 

As it is, he's a non-character in the movie and without having read the book, his betrayal is meaningless. He says why he does it, but we don't *care*. We've seen him for maybe two minutes onscreen by that point and know nothing about him at all. 

Yueh being the traitor is supposed to matter on an emotional level. It's supposed to be a big deal. But it's not, because Yueh is just this random doctor we barely see. There's nothing there to invest in. At least we got to learn his name and occupation, unlike Piter de Vries.",qd6vqv
hhmx57z,"Ah I missed that about the reserves, thanks for clarification on that point. I plan on rewatching with subtitles to catch more of the details in the dialogue because there was a lot that didn’t connect for me in the theatre. Overall though, my general point still stands. If the entire point was to assassinate House Atreides, why did we need to do it on Arrakis?

But the way it's delivered in my opinion is extremely bland and confusing. It didn't feel epic at all to me, nor did I get any cool lore. Just teases that it's there.

If I borrow the comparison to LOTR's fellowship of the rings, I was excited from the start, I loved the characters, we got to know them, there was so much lore and details that when it ended I couldn't wait for the next film. Here, I felt like I watched 2 and a half hours of some pretty footage and learned basically nothing.",qd6vqv

hitxneb,"Sure, that makes sense. Then I think they should have expedited a lot of this movie and included more of the story. I don’t think the movie needed to linger on this part of the story for 2.5 hours. It wasn’t enough to be satisfying. It felt like I watched the first 3 episodes of a TV show that just ends without satisfyingly finishing any story beats.",qd6vqv
hhwlumc,"Well, it’s a call back to Leto’s comment of needing to procure desert power.  Which is the Fremen.

hhmfxx8,really indeed.,qd6vqv
hi2otas,"Well it's fine if he's strong. The problem comes from the fact that he faces no meaningful conflict apart from being whisked from one location to the next because the plot demands it. He makes no choices of his own apart from maneuvering the craft in the sandstorm. The rest is just him watching sullenly at something.

The whole gurney and Duncan thing is so disappointing given the hype these two men supposedly have. What's the use of the hype if it never amounted to anything? Sardaukar looked a million times more badass than anything else, then I'd say fremen, and last were Atreides.",qd6vqv

hhvllyv,"Yeah, consistency with the way people spoke is my one main criticism on the movie. Game of Thrones was superb with accents in different houses/regions and being consistent with it. Or Avatar, with the Na’vi having a distinct accent, and all the actors who were the Na’vi being consistent with themselves and each other. I wish Dune showed that. For Zendaya, it was like she did an accent in some takes and not in others. It was so weird and completely distracted me. Timothee sounded slightly different than how he normally does, so I appreciated his effort. It’s simple things like that to make the audience forget the actor and see the characters.",qd6vqv
hilkb6z,"I'm not the guy whose comment you responded to, but I'm in the camp of someone who has no experience with Dune other than knowing its a famous Sci-Fi series. 


All I can say is, ""yup, that sure was a 2.5 hour movie."". I'm really surprised at how many people are saying that this is gonna be the movie of the year. I guess I can agree in that I'm willing to bet it's gonna win some awards, but in the same way that loads of big seemingly important movies in the moment win awards and are then immediately forgotten about the following year. 


Like, it looks great. I'm not gonna say it looks bad, it's a very visually interesting film, but that's kinda all there was. Paul has visions, cool, but other than those visions existing as proof that he's a chosen one of some sort (doesn't help that he's got all sorts of white savior tropes surrounding him seemingly going to become Space Lawrence of the Arabians), they don't seemingly do anything in the movie? Paul himself doesn't do anything in the movie other than the last 15 minutes or so. His house gets betrayed and that's just it. I still have no idea what he's like as a character other than generic stoic good guy prince. He just kinda accepts his role and he only has one line that shows how he feels about it, but then he's just, ""Yup, this is what ima do now."". It's also really weird that Zendaya's character keeps popping up in his visions and then she literally doesn't do anything for the plot when she finally shows up. 


I'm getting the sense that this movie was made for the fans; not so much for people unfamiliar with the series.",qd6vqv

hi4x5vr,"My exact thoughts, there was so much important stuff it made nothing important and I was kinda just along for the bumpy ride sorta jumping around scenes.",qd6vqv
hhswqct,"The book made sense on its own. I think this movie really doesn’t. Like what would you think his mom is? They give very little explanation on that, you’re just supposed to assume she’s some sort of psychic. There’s a lot of questions I’d have if I didn’t know the world already. 

Pretty meh movie outside of the visuals",qd6vqv
hhsvrr3,Yeah the doctor was just kind of tossed into the movie out of nowhere.,qd6vqv
hhwzyna,"Is the whole""the commoners just don't understand true art"" attitude really necessary?

I'm honestly struggling to see the compelling character growth that you describe. Yes, Paul accepted the call of adventure to begin his journey, but for most movies, it doesn't take 2.5 hours to arrive at that point. 

The climax of the movie is a knife duel with a character we know nothing about. The mother mentions that Paul has never killed anyone before, but is that important? We are never shown that him killing would be a big issue. And after it happens, he gets over it quickly and seems unaffected by the last scene. 

What are the subtleties that I'm missing here?",qd6vqv

himdemm,Right? It's like they just threw out the entire BG concept except for one witch.,qd6vqv
hi74gjf,"Ah, no. The entire point of a BG training isn't just to control her ovaries. That's a hilariously misogynistic way of looking at it. It's just ONE of the many things they can do as a by-the-way to what they actually can achieve. 

Also - she was \*told\* to only bear daughters, and she disobeyed. 

Also - they're not emotionless, but they have a superhumanly high level of control over their nervous system so they can regulate better than others - and above all, they know to never show their reactions, because that's what gives others power over them. There's a reason they were called witches - their entire lives were dedicated to developing abilities the rest of the people couldn't access without lifetimes of rigorous training and discipline.  


Jessica always knew she would have a very strong advantage in Arrakis: the Missionaria Protectiva. All of the early drivel about the Kwisatz Haderach wasn't even in anyone's thoughts until well after they got lost in the desert and joined the Fremen. It took her the longest to believe it - at first she just wanted to exploit it in order to maximise their chances at survival. 

The BG strategies are always a hundred moves ahead, so even on a personal level Jessica is very seldom \*not\* in control of the situation. 

Making her an emotional mess is akin to giving superman pimples and an itchy arse. We don't need them to be more human - we read about them because they \*aren't\*, and yet Herbert still did an amazing job of making her relatable. There was no need to mess with that.

Edit: lol nobody has read the books huh.",qd6vqv

The unknown is the perfect way to end it, it gets people talking what will happen next, how does Paul avenge his father, what of Jessica and her baby. How will the fremen tie into it, will they help 
or see them as outsiders 

The way the ending was handled though was a bit anticlimactic, it introduced Jamis 15 mins in and we felt no connection to him. That needed more time to flesh out, the whole encounter and fight felted rushed.

The scene of them escaping is very climatic, it ends on a high note as they race into the storm and we see them escape finally but crash land. Having him recite the litany as they do is a high note too.",qd6vqv

No idea what you are talmbout with pacing, and the film isn't a vehicle for retelling things from the book exactly as we think they should be retold.  I find it pretty hard to believe the Reddit hivemind could come up with a better version of the story to this point than the literally best director in the world, at the moment.

It's chef's kiss.

>""he could have cut off 30 minutes just by reducing the unnecessary length of the lingering shot"".

hid3bbu,"> I loved blade runner 2049 and hated this. Blade Runner had a story and even a twist, not to mention lush highly dynamic cinematography, and humanity.

I think for the full effect to happen the second film needs to complete the story. It may be one of those films where the completion of second film makes the first film great. There is definitely story in Dune (multiple stories), but it's a bit like Blade Runner where you have to look into the scenes/characters more carefully to find those stories.

In Dune there's essentially 4 sub plots accompanying the main plot of Paul realising and becoming the Kwisatz Haderach:

- Emperor and Baron forming an alliance undercover and everything they sacrificed to do what they had to do (their actions and intentions will become even more clearer next film as you see them more... and you'll see the Emperor for the first time).

- The Bene Gesserit breeding program that has been conducted over hundreds of generations over thousands of years, all with the sole purpose of creating a superhuman being which will enable them to have control over the universe if this being is born under their supervision. They also have been planting fake religions from thousands of years ago amongst civilizations about the Kwisatz Haderach so that in the future the Bene Gesserit can manipulate these civilizations who have been conditioned over thousands of years to believe in a 'fake' messiah. This will be further expanded even more in second film where they'll talk more in detail about the Bene Gesserit powers.

- Then there's the story between Paul and his mother and their relationship. You already see tension from the get go of this movie where Paul disapproves of his mother telling the Reverend Mother about his dreams, then he becomes angered at his mother (even hating her) for being apart of this plan to experimentally breed him into existence to fulfil some prophecy that he  is scared of.

- Lastly there's the Fremen. You only get to experience a bit of their culture and see a bit from there side. But the next film is all about the Fremen, so I makes sense to lightly introduce them a little here.",qd6vqv

Paul is fighting with being a harkoonen him self the people who killed his father in the desert before he even sees chani in person and it was a mistake in my opinion to leave it out.


its after they flee after the attack, he wakes up in the tent in the desert and realizes it:

pg 130:

""There's a way to evade the Harkonnens,"" she said. ""The Harkonnens!"" he sneered. ""Put those twisted humans out of your mind."" He stared at his mother, studying the lines of her face in the light of the glowtab. The lines betrayed her. She said: ""You shouldn't refer to people as humans without--"" ""Don't be so sure you know where to draw the line,"" he said. ""We carry our past with us. And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should--we are Harkonnens."" Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation. But Paul's voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging her with it. ""When next you find a mirror, study your face--study mine now. The traces are there if you don't blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones. And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're Harkonnens."" ""A . . . renegade branch of the family,"" she said. ""That's it, isn't it? Some Harkonnen cousin who--"" ""You're the Baron's own daughter,"" he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. ""The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you."" The way he said 'you' struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past reached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted--it wasn't to end the old Atreides-Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their lines. What? She groped for an answer. As though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: ""They thought they were reaching for me. But I'm not what they expected, and I've arrived before my time. And they don't know it."" Jessica pressed her hands to her mouth. Great Mother! He's the Kwisatz Haderach!",qd6vqv

And how the barón would sleep with a lot of women but the Bene gesiert implanted jessicas mom so paul can eventually be born. It was at the time they were lost in the desert they discuss this because he had to fight with being a Harkoonen as well even though they killed his father.   He was a monster too. Paul actually brings it up to him mom! I double checked in the book because i was confused it was never brought up. Not sure if it’s even brought up sooner in the book. 2nd film will probably bring it up way later. .

It also might have implications because it means that he'll be joining the freman with Jamis out of the picture, which might be a different experience than if he'd somehow joined them with him in the picture. 

after the visions establish that Jamis can be a decent man, rather than just an angry violent person, the fact that he's eager to fight paul demonstrates a healthy skeptisism. There's rumblings that paul is the messiah. An unending faith and devotion to him from the Freman is the fuel which leads to the catastrophic jihad. You know what screams a lack of faith and devotion in someone though? getting them to fight to the death with you. He wouldn't have wanted to fight him and kill him if he believed everything told about Paul, so that shows the sort of guy he is, and if he'd been around when Paul was a Freman perhaps he would've rained him in, but when Paul gets approval by killing the skeptic, there's no skeptic left.",qd6vqv

Lasgun and shield interaction not being shown or talked about

Yueh’s betrayal had no impact, really felt like the audience should know more about his conditioning and background more

No mention of the butlerian jihad, along with this mentats were a huge dropped ball

I think the movie captured the visual and aesthetic I pictured of the books well and especially the fremen and ecology in general, but I was disappointed there wasn’t more of the lore that’s integral to the books while still feeling like a rushed movie.

It’s also mentioned that there’s civil unrest in the city due to the increased population as House Atreides added a few hundred/thousand people and they have to build more devices to capture moisture just to support the population. Spitting is a sign of respect as you’re giving away like half a days worth of water right there. Even most Fremen’s suits are empty much of the time.

hhzqh1d,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhz5xh9,"Don't think of those things as dealing with the problem of water.  Think of them more like dealing with the problem of dying in the desert.

Which was entirely my point.  What you took from the movie is exactly what I thought the message was - and it was the wrong message.

The movie had these great scenes but failed to connect the dots for the audience so they really understood exactly what was happening.

The spitting on the floor - the spitting in the coffee - they were good for a laugh and shock and weirdness value.  But they are so incredibly important and will be missed by the non-readers.

Consider:

The Stillsuits keep water loss to less then a thimble full of water a day while in the desert.

Stilgar walks up to the Duke and spits on the floor.  It is a sign of respect.  He is willing to pay more then a days loss of water in your home as a sign of what he is willing to do for you.

-----------

look.  Here is the thing.

I loved this movie, but the movie pales in comparison to the book.  It is a fascinating, deep book that covers many different topics.  The movie barely brushes against the topic of ecology.  It is front and center in the book.

Water is a stand in for the oil economy. Religion.  Holy crap.  Religion.  The movie REALLY does dirty to the Bene Gesserit. 

There are three entities in the book competing for power.  A group called CHAOM (think big business.  Think the power big business has over government.  That entire endless debate in the US about the voice and pressue private industry puts on government, that is CHAOM).  The Empire - of which The Duke is a part is obvious.  That is government.  The spacing Guild.  The spacing guild has a monopoly on transportation.  

And the Bene Gesserit.  Religion.  They control religion.  Turn on the news and check out the anti-vaxxers spouting there nonsense.  Ask yourself, 'What if this isn't entirely what it seems.  What if someone has something to gain from these idiots.'.

That is what the Bene Gesserit do.  They create religions, put people NOT in positions of power but in very close proximity to power (The Dukes concubine, Jessica) and play all three of those previous entities like puppets on a string.

I am getting a bit off track here, but since I have turned this into a sales pitch for the book anyways.  If you are curious about feminist and such, the women in this book are powerful and unique creatures.

That moment with Jessica in the Ornithopter?  Jessica has and always will be a Bad Ass.  The Bene Gesseritt are feared for good reason.  Not only was she gagged because they were terrified of The Voice, but they put a deaf guard on the ornithopter as insurance.",qd6vqv
hi03hnp,"I interpreted Shadout as being a 'spy' or 'go between' between the Fremen and the Attreides to 'feel them out'.

I am doing my first re-read in like.... 4 years or so right now.  Where I am in the book and my memory she turns up at her introduction where she had been previously prepped to present Jessica with a Crysknife.

She is the person who knocks on Paul's door and almost gets hit with the .... thing... the name escapes me.  To honor the water debt she informs Paul that there is a traitor.

Isn't she the woman who meets the water beggers after the feast (not there yet in my reread... I could possibly be wrong on that).

And I think the movie is correct in her death being the beginning of the invasion.

My interest is kind of like a Bobba Fett sort of thing.  I have exactly enough information about the character to make me really want to know more, and enough to imagine that she has seen/done some shit.

For a book like Dune, with 412 pages, yeah, that's 7-8 hours, maybe a bit more, even before you add scenes that aren't in the book, such as the >!sardukar preparation scene!< 

That isn't really possible with movies, which are subject to a 3-hours-max-unless-you-want-an-intermission (which no one does).   That would be three movies, at least, which is a *huge* problem for movies, which the Studios expect to be a ""Wait (at least) a year for the next one.""   With (no fewer than) 3 movies, you would need to be able to find *at least* two appropriate ending points that people would tolerate waiting (at least) a year to follow up on.

TVs is even harder, because even if you *can* find a network that is willing to give you an hour slot for 13 weeks (in the US, generally no more, nor less), traditional networks *often* required a pilot (which doesn't work with books), *and* you would not only need to find 12 ""See you next week!"" type breaks, *each* with *precisely* 40-45 minutes of run-time apart.  *And* you would *also* need to find two to four ""We'll be right back after this commercial break!"" pauses in the story *between* each suck break, with a decent amount of time between each.

...but none of those restrictions apply to Streaming Services.

* 2-3 breaks that are tolerable for almost a year?  Not needed when you can, if you choose, release the entire show at once.
* The need to fit the story into 13, evenly sized chunks?  Not necessary; you're producing a show, in however many episodes you need, not fitting your story to a network's ""season.""  As such, if you can find 12 such ""wait a week"" breaks, you can do so... but if the story works better with 15, or as few as 4?  Great!  That just means you have a 16, or 5, episode series, instead of 13.
* Also, because you're not trying to fit into a specific *time slot,* those breaks don't have to be approximately evenly spaced.   One of the *story driven* breaks is only 30 minutes after the previous one?  Or it's an hour and 10 minutes?  Not a big deal, just warn your viewers of the runtime ahead of time, and they'll be fine.
* ""Commercial Breaks""?  Not necessary *at all* (for Amazon, Netflix, Disney+)

Honestly, the Streaming future has the potential to be a new-dawn of Visual Storytelling.",qd6vqv

Objectively a better decision. Not even a real argument. It's a movie adaptation of a book. It's not the first unfilmable book adaptation, either. This has been done before, and the objectively better decision is to not info dump onto your audience, but to show the audience. If they don't pick it up, then sucks to suck, you just aren't smart enough to watch the movie. Go watch a lesser film that will hold your hand. 

> Seriously how a newcomer can understand what the gom jabbar test is really about just by watching Villeneuve version ?

""Why are you doing this"" - Paul

""An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape. What will you do?"" - Gaius Helen Mohiam

Test

""Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people. If you had been unable to control your impulses, like an animal, we could not let you live. You inherit too much power."" - Gaius Helen Mohiam

""Did you have to go that far?"" - Jessica

""You chose to train him in the way... He wields our power - he had to be tested! To the limits! So much potential wasted in a male. You were told to produce only daughters, but you and your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach.... You're lucky he didn't die in that room. If he is The One, he has a long way to go. His Sight is barely awakened and now he goes into the fire!"" - Gaius Helen Mohiam

> -spending so much time on Calladan (barely covered in the book) or Chani dreams and in the other hand barely explaining what the Bene Gesserit was extremely arguable. He's going to pay the price in the sequel(s) : His version of Kwisatch haderach is already flimsy but good luck explaining properly why Alia is an abomination now. And if it ever gets to Children of Dune (it's been hinted he wanted to shoot 3 Dune movies) , the Golden Path is going to feel tepid without the Bene gesserit worldview. I think skipping so much on the Bene Gesserit lore was a big mistake long term. 


""What does it mean? That I could be The One?"" - Paul

""The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners to the Great Houses..."" Jessica

""You steer the politics of the Imperium from the shadows.""

""For thousands of years, we've been carefully crossing bloodlines to bring forth-""

""The One""

""A mind. Powerful enough to bridge space and time. Past and future. Who can help us into a better future.""

What in the actual fuck did you want more for them to explain? That's as much of an info dump as humanly possible without it being blatantly obvious. The only difference from the book is the description of the truthtrance and the Truthsayer drug, how the Bene Gesserit can see down her bodies' memories, but only see down feminine avenues. The Kwisatz Haderach will see down both. AKA, a mind that can bridge space and time and see down both masc and fem memories. Wow, almost like it was almost all there. Almost word for bloody word. 

That's all that's needed to get to the point where we are at, and barely smaller than what is actually in the book. 
What more did you want? To actually spend another moment in an already dense movie describing that the Bene Gesserit can only see down feminine paths? Why? Can this not be discussed in the future when Paul undergoes his own transformation? Or at any other time that's actually necessary? 

> Lisan al gaib/missoniara protectiva

Is it not already obvious? Bene Gesserit steer politics, Gaius Helen Mohiam told Jessica that they had already done all they could for her on Arrakis, then they get to the planet and everyone expects the Bene Gesserit witch and her son, and I'm not hunting down the quote where Paul criticizes them spreading superstitions. Clearly, the BG spread myths on Arrakis to serve their ultimate purpose. Do yo want them to say every obscure terminology in the ""Terminology of the Imperium"" portion of the book, along with all their definitions? That would make some mega cringe storytelling in a movie. Saying new, strange words and then having to describe them with even more esoteric words - how to alienate your average viewer 101. Look, we all know the Kwisatz Haderach is just their ""The One"" - we don't need them to keep saying Kwisatz Haderach every time they want to say The One, which is why they used the well known movie lingo of The One to inundate the viewer into the world more easily. Likewise, do we need them to call their religion/superstition spreading the Missionara Protectiva for people to understand the Bene Gesserit spread religious myths for their own purposes?

>Straightup storytelling blunder

> just one exemple : why spend some time on introducing the Shadout Mapes character if it's to just introduce her and then kill her ??? to build up the Lisan al-gaib thing ? he could have done so with the crowd and Liet. Introducing Mapes is just a waste of time based on the course he chosed. He should have either choose to build up Arraken intrigue or keep it at its bare minimum.

The same can be said for the actual book. It follows the same course, tells us nothing more than that the crysknife must be blooded when unsheathed along with other important things of the crysknife. That's it. In the movie, she also enables us to learn that Jessica can communicate through sign language, which is useful later in Paul and Jessica's escape from the Harkonnens. The scene is lifted almost word-for-word from the book. The purpose of Shadout Mapes in both mediums is to give us a face of the average Fremen: to see the Bene Gesserits' work through the Missionara Protectiva in action. When you literally see the action, you don't need to hear Jessica's internal monologue of ""The Missionara Protectiva!"" You don't even need to know that terminology, it's plain as day - no need to waste a full minute establishing this term and inculcating it in people's minds so that when they see this scene they think ""The ***Bene Gesserit's*** Missionara Protectiva is at work here!"" instead of ""The ***Bene Gesserit*** were at work here!"" When you add the term, you actually make it worse, because that's another new term that people will miss, just adding another layer of confusion. All we need is the words ""On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you. A path has been laid."" Boom. That's it. Simple, easy dialogue, lifted from the book. There is little difference from ""The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there and softened it up somewhat."" All it did was remove the esoteric language that would muddy an already dense movie with more technical jargon: gom jabbar, Kwisatz Haderach, Harkonnens, CHOAM, Spacing Guild, Landsraad, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, Lisan al-gaib, crysknife, spice/melange, Fremen, ornithopter, Arrakis, Caladan, Sayyadina, Sardaukar, the amtal rule, Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV, Imperium, etc. Now you want to add unnecessary shit like Missionaria Protectiva, and shit that can be explained later like Bene Tleilax. 

There is no but or if about any of this, it's just objectively better story telling. The only people who care for more are fucking book nerds who want every single detail to be shoved into the film, with no care for how it actually affects the film.

For reference, the Fellowship of the Ring is 6K more words than Dune (181K words). Peter Jackson turned that behemoth of a book into a movie the same size as Denis' Dune. Only difference is that Peter Jackson adapted an entire fucking book larger than Dune into the same time frame of 2.5 hours. Denis spent that time to develop 5/8ths of Dune, just shy of 500 pages of the 800 pages of Dune. Shit needs to be left on the cutting room floor, and I guarantee you that Denis didn't remove anything that was necessary to get the ***entire*** message across. This is his baby, his life's goal. He's as big of a Dune nerd as the nerdiest mouth breathing neckbeard on this subreddit. This is shown by literally only a few major plot scenes of non-Harkonnen perspective missing from the 1st 500 pages: Jessica's discussion with Dr. Yueh, the dinner scene, Duncan Idaho being drunk, Jessica vs Thufir, and Jessica getting trapped under sand. Everything else? It's in there. None of those are essential to the plot, obviously.",qd6vqv
hl3svyb,"That's how I felt, but I think you've understated how badly they've handled the Bene gesserit in this film, Jessica is our representation, but she doesn't show any control of her emotions, ability to manipulate, or truthsaying in this film. Those were the things that made her interesting, and when she 'leaks' in the book and brings out all her emotion when Paul is angry at her, it is a big moment because she is previously shown to be someone trained in withholding her true feelings, or at least feelings she doesn't want the other person to see. I felt like she was constantly crying in this film and 'leaking' (I think that's how Herbert describes it in the book). Kinda felt her character wasn't anything special with all that.",qd6vqv

He was only in a few scenes, was that not because of your preexisting appreciation for him?

I'm sure by the ending after we've been on the journey alongside Paul you'd feel a level of attachment to him.

Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes."" That point is made more clearly in the second half and in the later books.",qd6vqv

hte1e4h,"Yeah, my intrepretation is, that's the path if Jessica didn't make it. On his own Paul is young enough to be accepted, so without Jessica his initiation wouldn't involve killing Jamil, in which case he becomes Paul's friend and mentor.

hhtqtn1,"I don't know which book it's in or what material but the harshness of the environment, combined with martial prowess, that a people are brought up in is directly related to how great a warrior they are.

hhxenrb,"Just because there are things in trailers that didn’t end up in the film doesn’t mean the film was shortened or that scenes needs to be extended. 

Lots of times things are filmed with the intent of them being alternate options for other things that serve the same purpose in a scene. Or sometimes they film bits specifically for trailer exposition, which they have no intention of actually putting in the movie (the “he’ll lose that one too” but may be an example of this). 

It’s not always A and B and then B gets cut, it’s often they film A and B and then they select one over the other. Paul’s scream is good example of this. They filmed a more extreme reaction and they also filmed a more subdued one, and ultimately went with the latter.",qd6vqv
hhtjzm8,Yeah it seemed breakneck pace at times,qd6vqv
hhr7huw,"Before the betrayal you really only see him twice I think. Examining Paul before the Bene Gesserit test, and after the spice harvester rescue.",qd6vqv

hhpowda,"I was also, until I remembered that Denis apparently doesn't ""do extended cuts"". He was asked about the prospect of it for BR2049 and he explicitly said he releases movies to be watched the way they are and not different varieties and versions.

hhw7382,"I doubt they did—they’d have to cast those other nobles—but I agree, that scene would’ve been great development for a number of characters, also shows the delicate political balance on Arrakis.",qd6vqv
hhxfny6,"I love how people are so quickly talking about this “extended cut” like it’s an *obviously real thing* based on… some trailer footage that didn’t make the movie, I guess?",qd6vqv
hhqgccf,"I mean, Frank himself changed the litany up half the time he included it. I think there's like three or four different versions.",qd6vqv
hhtiw9q,They said that part multiple times in the film. I distinctly heard it.,qd6vqv
hho9evn,"They changed the last line of the ""Bless the maker and his water"" benediction too. Like, why?",qd6vqv
hhwf4yv,"There are at least two versions of the litany in the books, if not more.",qd6vqv
hhqje5i,"I am was pleasently surprised that they had the scene in the tent with his mother talking about the Bene Gesserit manipulation, how they set him on this path. It felt like he didn't think he had any choice, and that he is being forced into this role of messiah 

Then at the end, it shows that he has chosen the role by staying on Arrakis. He realizes that it is a choice, he could do anything else but follow the path set before him, but he wants to do it.

In the later books, he and his son spend their lives trying to make sure their family has to be trapped by prescient abilities ever again.",qd6vqv
hhtd0on,"That was one of my favorite sequences in the movie. The movie does really really well with the BG stuff in general and this was a very effective way to show: ok, this is this character's emotional state, and (scene two) while feeling that way, their training lets them affect this level of poise anyway.",qd6vqv
hhsk5az,"There were absolutely lines delivered that were terrible. I'm not saying every single line was bad acting overall but there were a lot of really bad scenes.

Yes, she sobs like a baby. She doesn't show her fear only in private, did you even watch the movie?? She cries like a baby in public.",qd6vqv
hi31vr1,No it won't. It won't make any sense for Paul to say he's a friend of Jamis because he killed him 10 minutes after meeting him. In the book they actually travel together and get to know each other first.,qd6vqv

hhrem53,"Sure and as I said it is a cool addition by the movie. It even played a role in the plot when Leto tried to poison him and he flew up to the ceiling and hid in the corner, which is not what happened in the book word by word. And it's cooler in the movie.",qd6vqv
hi4pngx,"Cause Book Baron is all about appearance, but not flauting his power. He looks fat, but is able to move around without issue. Leading people to underestimate him. 

Movie Baron was in your face with his power. Which is funny cause he didn't have plans within plans. He was just a puppet of the emperor.",qd6vqv
hho7af0,Yeah and apparently they'll have to find someone who looks damn nice in *bald*,qd6vqv

Very similar to BR2049 horn on large ships: [Link at 0:31](https://youtu.be/KJe3IWZEZ1w?t=31)

Kind of crazy that I've seen BR2049 so many times, that I recognize the sounds.",qd6vqv
hhp3ug4,Agreed. So much that was silly in lynch's Dune was great in this version. I was especially impressed by how they portrayed the voice.,qd6vqv
hhqik00,I *love* the dragonfly copters!,qd6vqv
hj9zwc6,"Well they were pretty gross and dumb here, too. Just in a much better way.",qd6vqv
hhp15f8,"No they don't. They show them roll their eyes up to compute, they show a red mark on the lips (the way to tell apart a mentat), but there is zero mention of anything about these, or even the concept of mentats, human computers. Paul himself is being raised to become a mentat duke, so it's kind of an important concept.

None of the spice-evolved guild captains show up or talked about either beyond a single sentence of 'spice allows spaceship navigators to find safe routes between stars'.

Yet, I'm not sure if the movie would be better with these things explained. One of the challenges of adapting Dune to a movie is that you could easily bury the audience in exposition.

Maybe he saves a whole bunch of this for the second movie, to avoid overwhelming us with exposition dump after exposition dump on this one.",qd6vqv
hhpi7mi,"Nope. You had to read the book to get the movie. Major flaw. I kept having to pause to explain things to my wife. Line of the night. ""so spice is worm shit? That worm just ate its own shit.""",qd6vqv
hhreuop,They showed a bit of that when he turned on his shield just to get closer to a handicapped Leto. He never underestimated his adversaries.,qd6vqv
hhzd9er,I thought he looked alright as he is often shown as a bit more contemplative with his expression and his pauses. He commands presence but it isnt because he is loud or anything. He makes himself known quietly.,qd6vqv
hhrh4an,This film made him a really one-dimensional villain instead of the intrepid-yet-petty man he is in the book.,qd6vqv
hisgepp,"I saw the movie with someone who I don't think even saw the 84 version.  I asked him if he got the impression that the Baron was what you said, and he said no.  

I mean, I think part of his ego is well deserved because of how smart he knows he is, and the way he can control the face he puts on for different people.",qd6vqv

hhphnpx,"The ""Fear is a mind killer"" scene with the gom jabbar was pretty well done since all of that was supposed to be inner monologues.",qd6vqv
hhrhakb,"I heard a lot of complaints about that, but I felt it gave the film a good Shakespearean quality, which to me fits Dune as a novel rather well. Voice-over has become something audience just feel *too cool* for but I don't think its a bad stylistic method.",qd6vqv
hhwwq1d,Part of the same issue with an Ender's Game adaptation. Inner monologues are hard to translate onto screen well.,qd6vqv
hirmvrp,"Same here, my favorite part of that movie was the fact the had inner monologues. So few movies do it because apparently most people dislike it, but I think not having it makes so many scenes flat when what someone is thinking is almost always more important than what they say or are doing.",qd6vqv
hi0xp4l,"Baron Harkonnen is more or less a direct descendent of the Elizabethan era (Shakespearean) literary archetype of the Machiavel. Very comparable to Iago, probably my favourite of Shakespeare's villains. 

So yeah, absolutely not intended to be subtle, but I kind of missed that theatre style monologuing ham, even if I agree that the choices made did work very well to create a menacing villain.",qd6vqv
hi2b8uw,The Baron rapes and abuses young boys… don’t think that’s equivalent with Herbert saying “homosexuality’ is an “evil trait.”,qd6vqv

hhovnjd,"Of course there will be, lol.",qd6vqv
hit07yj,Because it should have been brought up in the film already in terms of when it’s brought up in the book and where the story is now. But they left it out completely. There was only a subtle hint at one point. It should have been said when Jessica and Paul were lost in the desert before the fremen found them.,qd6vqv
hhstqu8,"I’m not sure if he will be now or not. There’s no major reason you couldn’t just have Rabban take that role. I’d like to see him as a separate character though, and in the book he really isn’t introduced until around the time the movie ends anyway.",qd6vqv

hhq0b99,Even though he is not Bene Geserit trained the Baron does let go and reacts very instinctively multiple times in ways that are mind boggling and efficient.

Edit: after a second viewing I think the main reason the ships launch from underwater is that there is apparently not much flat ground on Caladan where a large spaceport could be located.

They had to do this because at some point humanity fought a war against their own AIs (the Butlerian Jihad) that pretty much ended up with Earth destroyed. So most of galactic civilization is *terrified* of AI, to the point where computers are heavily regulated and the one society that is pro-tech (Ix) are borderline pariahs. Mentats are humans basically trained to be walking computers, but take another drug that tends to stain their lips red which enhances mental ability.

So no spice = no space travel. And no intergalactic trade. So it *is* a proxy for oil, with CHOAM a stand in for OPEC. Each House basically controls a share of CHOAM stock, and represents their kingdoms at a big council called the Laansraad. Leto Atreides is apparently *super* popular there, and seen as a sort of benign oligargh and reformer, and the Emperor is super scared he could one day unseat him.

The Bene Geserrit are basically Illuminati nuns who have spent the last few tens of thousands of years reverse engineering every crazy thing you see out of Asian monasteries, to the point where they have borderline supernatural control over their own bodies. They've also discovered that by using spice they can tap into ancestral memory... but only on the female side.

Problem is without the correct calculations your vessel may end up lost/destroyed/in-a-sun/etc. They could use AI to fix that problem completely except the whole business of the AI war where humanity was pushed to the brink and Earth itself was dominated by machines. Eventually they discovered Spice on Arrakis/Dune and realised it OPENED THE MIND of certain humans and allowed humanity (Eventually navigators) to figure out how to jump their ships safely and defeat the AI. Basically with Spice you can move items across the galaxy easily, arrive at your enemy's planet before they can return their forces, etc.

Hence the saying ""He who controls the spice, controls the universe""",qd6vqv

It just happens to do all this other stuff, too. Imagine if you could drink crude oil and trip balls like alien LSD.",qd6vqv
hhleaos,"Spice opens up the mind and can alter the body. Navigators are people who are changed until they barely are human anymore, but have gained great mental abilities, most importantly the ability to ""fold space"", used to move ships instantly to a new place in the galaxy.    
     
The navigators can no longer survive without the spice, and without spice the empire will crumble as transports of food, troops, trade and information would grind to a halt. That is why ""the spice must flow"" - it is the most important resource in the universe.",qd6vqv
hhlhyic,"> Also is the emperor a major part in the future?

The emperor is a super important plot point but he has like no screen time until the end of the book. He's consequential but probably doesn't have more than 10 lines.",qd6vqv
hhlrvs8,"> Ah so the spice isn’t used for fuel at all? 

No but it's effect is basically the exact same. It's a pretty thin reference for oil.",qd6vqv
hhl2r4r,"the emperor is a big part of the entire book, so i'm kind of surprised he wasn't in the movie. they'll have to cram a lot of his story in part two.",qd6vqv
hhmgej0,"As others have said, it is consumed by the members of the Spacing Guild who pilot ships, the effect it has on them (a very low grade version of the effect it has on Paul) allows them to pilot through space.

The movie also didn't really focus it's other uses, a notable one being as a sort of recreational drug.  It's terribly addicting, to the point that a person can develop a physical dependency on it.  It also has the effect of extending human life a great deal.

I think those additional aspects help explain why the spice is so important in the universe of Dune.  However, perhaps if you're making a movie you just want to focus on one thing, and one of the big symbolic interpretations of the spice is as an analogue for oil.  So it's not too surprising that you would have tied it's use to fuel.

The Emperor is important and we would definitely see that character in the next movie.  I am also looking forward to seeing who they cast for the part (the character was not featured in Part 1).",qd6vqv
hhlkxgp,"As a fan of the books, who also realizes that compromises need to be made for adaptation, there was a single instance where I felt they outright left something out, and it was in the explanation of Spice.

Also because it would be such a simple fix. All that was required was adding the words ""geriatric"" and ""prescient"" to the exposition spiel at the start of the film. It would still wooosh by most people, but at least you've included those words for people who can add together very large sums and a reference point to explain it to those who missed it slightly. Considering how well they set up the subversion for the second movie, it really feels like a proper oversight.",qd6vqv

Yeah, almost everything in Dune is mind over matter.  So the mentats when their eyes go white are tapping into their brain's supercomputer-like capabilities to do superhuman calculations.

Salusa Secundus was a prison planet. The Sardaukar lived under horrible conditions and those horrible conditions are what led to them being so tough. They had to struggle to survive from the day they were born. The weak died off and the strong survived and continued to reproduce. Conditions like that don’t exactly turn people into muscle bound mass monsters. Furthermore, in the books the Sardaukar were meant to be analogous to the Fremen. That’s why Leto talked constantly about “desert power” and tried so hard to ally himself with the Fremen. Both the Sardaukar and the Fremen were products of the harsh, inhospitable planets that they grew up on.",qd6vqv

hhttqhv,Have you read the books?,qd6vqv
hhs60f8,"Yeah, conveying that confusion between Piter and Baron is difficult without being too cheesy e.g. that POV where the two are blurry and mixed up.

Loved how Leto was lucid enough to get a direct shot, but the Baron fled upwards in a panic and the gas was still potent enough to clean the entire room. I was fine with that liberty taken. Piter’s withered corpse looked amazing.",qd6vqv
hhv2p21,">The book makes it easier for him because it's Piter de Vries who leans right up close to look at Leto, but Leto (in his clouded dazed vision) thinks he's the baron and breathes out the gas all over him.

You're thinking of the 1984 movie: in the book Leto has no confusion over who the Baron is, triggering the gas when the Baron moves away from him. The gas kills everyone in that room, whether they were close to Leto or not:

""They're all dead in there?"" the Baron asked.

""Yes, m'Lord.""

The only thing that saves the Baron is that his shield was on:

""He could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been pushing himself away from the table ...""",qd6vqv
hhu4e1n,Hail Paimon,qd6vqv
hhsgdy1,"Furthermore, if you delve into the books and the workings of the Holtzman shields, they can be dialed to certain frequencies to allow things to pass through at different speeds (if I recall correctly, the average allows for speeds of lesser than 6-9cm/sec to penetrate). Gases will pass through so you can breathe, but the novel makes it clear that there is still somewhat of a filter effect - gas, air, passes through slightly slower than normal, sort of like wearing a mask. Sounds are slightly muffled, and in Paul's training fight with Gurney, it's mentioned:

""The air within the shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish.""

Fighting with a shield means your air interchange is stifled slightly, making it more and more difficult to breathe the longer and more strenuous your activity. Thus, while the Baron's shield flashed red showing that the poison was indeed passing through, it was still filtered just enough that he was able to to use his suspensor harness to float up above it and escape the worst of it in time.",qd6vqv
hhsgj22,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhsg9j3,"This is going to be a HUGE nerdy nit-pick but... how did the shield protect the Baron from poison gas? The shield, as I understand it from not only how this film explained it but from the book as well, only protects someone from swift motions, from blades, bullets, or someone punching for instance. It shouldn't block gas (how would you breathe while within the shield if it did?). A vaporous gas should have had no problem penetrating the shield then.",qd6vqv

If the visions follow the logic of the books this is not because some visions are ""more true"" than others it is because he sees many potential futures which still depend on his subsequent actions to come true. So him not dying to Jamis happened because something leading up to it was different.

Pretty much everyone who died managed to die in a unique and dramatic way.",qd6vqv
hhqp60o,"Aye, that’s the only part of the character change that bugged me with Kynes. 

Still could’ve died there, but would’ve made sense for her to be aware of what was coming at least. Especially them making it clear she’s Fremen, not just a sympathizer. Takes away from some of the mystic they were building in the movie.",qd6vqv

hhu49d7,She was more worried about the worm eating her than the Sardaukar killing her. Which is actually how she died anyways.,qd6vqv
hk3dhm6,"I've re-thought this scene.  I think it's supposed to show us how absolutely focused you have to be in order to climb up on a worm.  That's one reason why she didn't hear somebody sneaking up on her.  The worm was also *really* loud, which adds to that dynamic.  It's also a Sardaukar - they're supposed to be pretty good at sneaking up on people.  ALL 3 of these things combined = me being okay with this scene.",qd6vqv
hi4vjt5,"Yeah, worms can be ridden, but only mastered by the fremen - https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sandworm_(Dune):

>The Fremen have secretly mastered a way to ride sandworms across the desert. First, a worm is lured by the vibrations of a thumper device. When it surfaces, the lead worm-rider runs alongside it and snares one of its ring-segments with a special ""maker hook"". The hook is used to pry open the segment, exposing the soft inner tissue to the abrasive sand. To avoid irritation, the worm will rotate its body so the exposed flesh faces upwards, lifting the rider with it. Other Fremen may then plant additional hooks for steering, or act as ""beaters"", hitting the worm's tail to make it increase speed. A worm can be ridden for several hundred kilometers and for about half a day, at which point it will become exhausted and sit on the open desert until the hooks are released, whereupon it will burrow back down to rest. Worm-riding is used as a coming-of-age ritual among the Fremen, (*dune sequel movie spoilers ahead, after the events of Dune 2021*) >!and Paul's riding and controlling a giant sandworm cements him as a Fremen leader.!<",qd6vqv

People are being stabbed to death and having their throats cut every 5 seconds, entire companies of soldiers are obliterated, there are piles and piles of burning corpses shown _very_ in-focus. Not to mention the _genocide_. It wasn't like it was Marvel style cartoony violence either, it was absolutely brutal. I guess all they'd need to do is show one nipple and it'd be rated R. And come to think of it I guess no one swears in the movie. So, as long as you don't swear or show a titty you can have your characters actively commit genocide and it's okay for the kids. The rating system is absolutely bonkers.",qd6vqv

His betrayal isn't that shocking in the movie because you barely know who he is and unique set of circumstances to even allow the betrayal to happen.",qd6vqv
hhlx74w,Exactly.  Nothing in there I would’ve wanted to see cut out just to spend more time with Liet musing about ecology.,qd6vqv
hi0xn3y,"People are complaining about how this feels like half a movie, but I'm super glad they split it up in order to get more of the worldbuilding in.  As you said, even at 2.5 hours and only covering half of the first book, they still had to leave some stuff out.  I shudder to think how shallow and rushed the movie would have felt if it covered the entire first book.",qd6vqv
hhl45no,"Totally agree that some compromises had to be made. I love Liet’s death in the book but of all the omissions this movie had in ok with this one. Liet’s character was missing a loooot of development for that scene to even be considered. 

I think Denis could have done a great Dune show but for me I think there are a few too many compromises. I know people there’s a valid argument for compromising when adapting to screen (to which I agree) but I think this movie had a few too many for my liking.",qd6vqv
hhmcm5i,"I'm more curious to get the opinion of people that know nothing about Dune and go to watch the movie to see what their takeaway is, because I don't think they did a great job as far as making things clear.

hhmpj9x,"it is only part one, lol i totally agree though. need more!",qd6vqv
hhlw28z,"That feels more like the blame should be placed more on the directing and less on the runtime of the movie. Look at the Fellowship of the Ring, it was only one movie yet it could stand on its own and all the characters were developed.",qd6vqv

hhmgink,"Yeah, David Dalmalchian and Piter both deserved better",qd6vqv
hhmdxil,I agree. I’ve said this a few places but removing the dinner party scene and rushing to the betrayal without any build up removed all the tension that makes the beginning of Dune so incredible,qd6vqv
hhmgn2n,"Not my favorite but it’s also up there for me. A wasted opportunity, but imo there were two or three missed opportunities prior that would have had to have been hit for it to work in the movie",qd6vqv
hhqeqlz,"Kynes death and the dinner scene were the changes I was most disappointed in. But the more I thought about Kynes, the more I thought how important the inner monologue in that scene was and probably wouldn’t have been as cool in the movie, would’ve had to do VO or something which would’ve been jarring since the only VO there was was Chani. So I’ve accepted that change. Plus, the death she got instead was fucking pretty fucking cool taking a couple sardaukar with her, and previewing worm riding.",qd6vqv
hhmc0v6,It started off pretty cool with Tufir's eyes rolling back into his head to do calculations in his first scene and I thought we were going to see more of that. And that ended being pretty much the only thing he did.,qd6vqv
hhmfty1,"Totally agree. I said in another comment that they got shafted along with Liet, Yueh, and Shadout Mapes. I don’t think the word Mentat is even uttered in the movie, much less the fact that Paul is one? Realistically for a film having him be a male Bene Gesserit is enough, but part of his abnormality is that he has undergone mentat training",qd6vqv
hhmmzxh,"Right. I think they should have ended early in favor of some exposition. People say the film would have been slow paced, but even with all the action parts still felt like a slog because there was no context. People can handle a bit of background",qd6vqv
hhmeaa6,"That would have been sick. I have no problem with Liet being a woman and maybe the actress could have done better with a better script, but Kynes needs to have *presence* and clear leadership. In this version of the story she never really got to display that until her death scene",qd6vqv
hhly4go,"Although I agree, I just don’t think there was any way around it other than making it a TV show. It was already 2.5 hours, I don’t see how they could have fit anything else in. 

Only possible way would be cutting earlier in the overall timeline of the story, but I think they went to where they did so they can explore more character/world building in the next one",qd6vqv
hhlbp2m,"Honestly I'm kind of okay with a lot of the arrakis arrival pre coup nonsense being dropped. It was exhausting when you knew Jessica was not behind it and the Duke was going to die. Although the movie did not show that, they built up the foreboding and anxiety enough I think it was pretty clear.

I was surprised when it was the evening and the Duke said ""I thought we'd have more time"" when I realized they were going to do the coup already. I was a bit confused by some of the pre coup stuff (like that stupid dinner). But once it started going I was like, okay we can definitely live without all that meaningless nonsense and get right to it lol.

Although I would've like a little more showing of Jessica's ability prior to their escape. We really didn't see her use anything til the thropter but that was alright becuase that's when it mattered more.

Paul was great but he was missing his innocent sense of humor I felt like? Though they conveyed or tried to in the beginning with Duncan. 

I did wonder why they seemed to swap the roles of gurney and Duncan i.e. i thought Paul in the book thought of gurney as his BFF rather then Duncan?",qd6vqv
hhmgsfe,Totally agree. I know it’s a movie and never gonna be perfect but there was just so much missing,qd6vqv
hic830r,I thought Jessica and Leto was well done. It was very subtle and didn’t need much dialogue but he’s essentially accusing her of being against him and asks that she take care of Paul.,qd6vqv
hhmdzep,"I agree, Liet and Yueh got the worst of it though IMO",qd6vqv
hhtm7xi,"It's crazy, the whole book is about the Worms and Arrakis, but no time is given to either of them. Kynes getting swallowed by a worm is fine but cutting out the pre-spice mass bit sucks out so much of the depth.",qd6vqv
hhvbss5,"Totally agree. I thought other characters got some worse than Jessica, but otherwise I’m on board",qd6vqv
hicb5uv,"Yeah, I said this elsewhere but that’s my favorite scene in the book and I’m sad both Lynch and Villanueva don’t see the value in its inclusion. It does a lot of characterization for Liet, Leto, and Paul. Trim some of the Chani dreams and Duncan action so you can include that and Yueh talking to Jessica while Paul sleeps, and you solve my primary issues with the film (also show Fremen escaping the crawler and have the destroyed carryall instead of ‘maybe’ sabotaged)",qd6vqv
hi8b4nr,Not really. Its a 160 minutes long. Not 600 like a tv series,qd6vqv

hi59thv,Good lord. I didn't realize how much I missed in those visions until I came back home from the theater and turned on the subtitles. I had NO CLUE about this whole born again aspect and it added so much to my enjoyment.,qd6vqv
hhlmwiz,"I definitely *understand* that, I just hate it. I've never really been a fan of the theater, unless I'm at one of those rare screenings where there's only 3 people in the entire room. It's just nicer to be able to turn on subtitles, pause to go to the bathroom or grab another beer, eat whatever I want without bothering anyone, so on.",qd6vqv
hhljbym,It's interesting. In the book she expresses doubt through inner monologue. You can't really do that on film though. So I understand why they made her more emotional than in the book,qd6vqv
hie0o8j,"I respectfully disagree. I thought she came off as protective and capable. (granted I haven't read the books) 

She seemed like she really tried to help when Paul had his hand in the box. She had badass moves on the ship when she was gagged and then at the end when Javier's character got outclassed by her she just kissed his the dudes head like he's out of her depth all while losing her home and husband within the week.",qd6vqv
hhpgjwp,"I think this was my biggest disappointment. In the books she is filled with internal doubt, but she is extremely powerful, and respected/feared by everyone who interacts with her. Here she seems weak, and the bennie gesserits powers are pretty much limited to the voice (which was pretty coo)",qd6vqv
hhlg8rs,"You see her control her emotions a fair bit in the film though, especially around Leto. I think they struck a nice balance, and it's important to show that she does let her emotions control her a bit, which is central to her character.",qd6vqv
hhlzsrz,"The whole point of Jessica though is that she broke from Bene Gesserit rules, the biggest being that she had Paul. Even in the books she is not an emotionless husk, she loves Leto, and that’s why she did what she did. She is very much so wrecked by his death in the book.",qd6vqv
hhl1qoc,I don’t know I feel like the scenes where she breaks down could’ve been more effective if they stuck to the book’s rigidity around the Bene Gesserit’s emotions. A small complaint and I get that adapting all the inner dialogue is completely impossible. The film does a great job otherwise IMO.,qd6vqv
hho20ti,"It's also a key plot that her emotions, her love for the Duke, have altered the course of history.  Paul is a result of her love, her failure of Bene Gesserit self control.  I think this is a good analog to that.",qd6vqv
hhqlqla,"At the end of the day it is a movie and they need to let the actors act.  It’s a different medium.  It stinks to lose some nuance from the book, but it’s 100% necessary here if you want the movie to feel more natural and not have Star Wars prequel levels of feeling wooden.",qd6vqv
hhlenw1,"Wait? How come I remember it (the desert sand hut one) being a scene where she breaks down and Paul doesn't and needs to help her over it, because he suddenly had his ""next step in evolution"" and couldn't feel that strongly anymore? So he was even envious for her mother to be able to go through the motions with the death of Leto, while he properly couldn't?",qd6vqv
hhu5zov,"I think it was a conscious decision by Villeneuve and his team to change Jessica this way, in adapting for a film. As a non book reader, she still felt very capable and in control, yet we could see that she cared and loved deeply for her family. 

In a book, you can expose what people are thinking, while in cinema you have to rely on visual techniques. You can have voice over and exposition, but it rarely works for live action, and this film does not in any way have the tone to do voice over anyway.",qd6vqv
hhom5fi,Smart to leave this out.  Some things can't be translated on screen.,qd6vqv
hhq59n6,Yeah but I feel it was a good choice. No internal monologues means movies have to show not tell. Plus stoic characters are bad.,qd6vqv
hhrr3l9,"The book actively shows Jessica being driven by her emotions the majority of the time though. That she was more affected by Leto's death and was scared of Paul when he blamed her for the visions are both straight from the book. She disobeyed the Bene Gesserit to give Leto the son he wanted which is mentioned in the movie but doesn't establish how rare that is; to the point that the Emperor is jealous of Leto since his Bene Gesserit wife did obey the order and only provided him daughters.

And Paul actively views Jessica as an (albeit unintentionally) antagonistic force because the actions she takes to save her son and later to return her son what was his birthright serves to pour fuel on the fire of the jihad he foresees and can't avoid.

I'd say she's more stoic in the beginning of the book than she was in the movie (she's worried about the Reverend Mother's visit but not like she is portrayed in the movie) but her portrayal post Leto's capture/death is spot-on IMO.",qd6vqv
hhzfyxq,"Don't know if you read the later books, but there are a lot of Bene Gesserit that intentionally do not hide their emotions. They can control their bodies at the molecular level, emotions are nothing to them. 

It was more annoying that she had to shout the Litany Against Fear a dozen times instead of just thinking it to herself, but I guess you kind of had to do that in the movie.",qd6vqv
hhra0o2,"She was definitely a badass in the book. But you're right, concessions have to be made for the story to make sense to non-readers.",qd6vqv
hhvzrp4,Bene Gesserit don't need to do that in privacy though. They are still emotional people.,qd6vqv
hi3mms6,"Yeah if they showed her staying calm as her son was being tortured like that, it would have just made her look like a cold, uncaring bitch. This was fine.",qd6vqv
hhvb4f6,There was a scene like that though. She's crying in the hallway but then goes through the door completely calm and in control.,qd6vqv
hhl4w66,"She also whips Stilgar’s ass. Her feeling/showing emotion isn’t weakness. Just because you have control over your emotions doesn’t mean you won’t check in with them, feel them, and perhaps use them. I really liked this portrayal.",qd6vqv
hhl72m3,"I agree. I think the scene in the thopter and the one with the water are the only ones where we really see her come across like book!Jessica. No nonsense, mature and in control. I loved how at the end of this life and death scene in the thopter, all she says to Paul is ""your pitch was too high."" That's Jessica! 

I see people saying that there are too many stoic characters so they had to change hers but book!Jessica isn't stoic. She can be charming or regal, haughty or defiant, loving and warm with Leto. She *absolutely* expresses emotions, she just knows exactly how and when to deploy the right ones. 

In the book when we get to the scene where Stilgar suggests they kill Jessica and only save Paul, I immediately balked at the very idea because I knew how useful and awesome and versatile she is. When it happens in the movie, I didn't really feel anything because they haven't shown us any of her skills or abilities outside of the Voice.",qd6vqv
hhl2p36,Agreed.  The litany  against fear should have been recited far more calmly.,qd6vqv
hhlfn0k,"I agree but actually kept reminding myself a big part of the books was Paul using his training to pick up on his mother's emotions coming through and her training of control of her emotions wavering as she gets weaker with fear for him, his father, and ultimately grief. She can still fight but her emotions of fear, sadness, and grief become much less controlled as they endure more and his becomes better and it's a big role reversal for them. If they included a comment from him about it I think tht would've been portrayed better but they do never directly address it with each other, it's always a personal reflection",qd6vqv
higks5a,She was so much more in control and manipulative in the books. She also knew way more than the Duke about what was actually going on,qd6vqv
hhmqtcv,"I feel like it helped humanize the character without having to do some sort of voice-over internal monologue. It also works because she *does* show very strict control over her emotions and how they show.  
  
She *only* shows her emotions like that when she is alone, in the movie (with one exception I guess). It gives a feeling that this is something she is ""allowing herself"" when no one else is around. Whenever someone sees her, or when she is in a room with someone, she is stonefaced, unfeeling, strong, and in control.  
  
One very good example is how she is crying in the hallway, only to just walk through a door and come out the other side looking completely unaffected. There is not a single trace of her having cried literally a couple of seconds earlier (no puffy eyes, redness, tear streaks, etc). She then proceeds to talk to her Duke, and even comforts him.",qd6vqv
hhkp41j,"He's really good too, along with Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, etc etc etc, too many names to mention...

But I simply cannot imagine anyone better in the role of Lady Jessica than Rebecca Ferguson.  It was about as perfect a casting as you can get.",qd6vqv
hhkzzd3,I cannot fucking believe how authentic Bardem felt to the book character. Most accurate portrayal of any Dune character I've ever seen.,qd6vqv
hho5bdx,"Most of the casting was perfect, but I feel like Javier didn’t have a lot to do. Versus rebecca who had a shot ton to convey and she nailed it",qd6vqv
hhkxfnh,"people don't talk much about Javier Bardem. He's perfect, exactly how i pictured Stilgar in the book",qd6vqv
hhl3mcl,"And acting.  I never once was taken out of the moment, no matter how strange the plot or dialogue was.  Everyone completely sold it.",qd6vqv
hhq76jz,"Timothy could pass for a 15 year old in this movie, and you thought she looked younger? I never questioned that she could be old enough to be his mother, I think her eyes show a lot of wisdom and experience and they didn’t overdo her makeup which showed her age accurately. I guessed her age while watching and was off by 3 years. Thought she was 35 or so.",qd6vqv
hhr9wgo,Yeah I was thrown by that too. But I guess they didn't give her much time to show that side before everything started to happen.,qd6vqv
hhrhfd0,"> Jessica is confident, seemingly omniscient, and to be feared. In the books, at least. In the movie she just was sad/scared the whole time and had four lines of dialog. When she's sad or scared in the books it means something because of how powerful she's characterized. A little disappointing from the movie tbh.

The way I perceived it, it's clear in the movie that Lady Jessica taught Paul nearly everything he knows of import.  Whatever feats Paul was able to do, most of it was because of his mother's tutelage.  Even besting the fremen at the end was due to his mother teaching him the weirding way, far more so than whatever Duncan Idaho or Gurney Halleck taught him.

Throughout the movie, his mother walks Paul through what to do during life or death situations.

Duke Leto on the other hand gave Paul his big picture perspective, that he is/will be the Duke, and best get a handle on that.",qd6vqv

In the books, the reason Yueh betrays the Atreides isn't because he thinks his wife will be freed- rather, he wants to *confirm* that she's dead (because he knows the Harkonnen are disgusting).

At least with LOTR I understood their purpose and journey, I don’t feel myself attached to or invested on any character and all this lore and premonition turned out boring. The fight choreography wasn’t even good, you have Oscar Isaac, Brolin and Momoa and you don’t use in them in a good way?

And this guy had the guts to shit on the MCU a few weeks ago?",qd6vqv

hhtbpx1,"This movie was a great commercial for the book.

One of the biggest criticisms new readers have is the massive amount of lore-dumping and esoteric terminology being thrown in your face from page one. The movie presents a lot of these ideas in a more digestible format (it also helps readers visualize the more abstract architecture/technology). 

Instead of opening up the book and saying, “wtf is a Bene Gesserit” you’ll instead say, “I know what that is! I hope we get more juicy tidbits about them!”",qd6vqv

I loved it, I really did. I cannot wait to watch this again and then immediately go see part 2, as I think this movie will shine so bright in that setting. It just, imo, doesn’t hold itself up as a standalone film (which I know technically it’s not supposed to)",qd6vqv

hhl9has,"Especially for everyone that was offed. Like, I get he's a villain but I couldn't care *less* about Fat Fly Boy's little servanty friend guy. And when Jason Momoa goes down, it hurt more because he was Jason Momoa than his relationship to any other character. I'm completely unfamiliar with the source material, but the doctor almost came off as a caricature and I couldn't even hate him for what he did because we saw so little of him. And so on.",qd6vqv
hhkn9y0,Agreed. That's the one the thing I didn't like about this. I wanted more from the characters which is hard to do for something as big as Dune for 2+ hours. This is why I feel like a series would have been better but that's likely just me.,qd6vqv

hhlo3hh,"I definitely recommend reading the book. The book is written in this really interesting way where you're constantly privy to the characters' inner thoughts and you're often told what is going to happen before it does and while that sounds like it would be deflating, it really works to create a sense of suspense or anxiety because you understand just how treacherous every situation the characters are in is. There's this consistent sense of dread where you just know that one wrong word or one wrong move could be someone's last or could ruin a potential alliance. It's really fascinating and the film really only covers the very broadest strokes.",qd6vqv
hhn7rqe,"Right? I feel like all the politics and political intrigue was purposely vague, and once you figured it out, it was easy to map it onto other real world/fictional examples. Female only jedis, except main character who is scifi jesus, these guys are colonizers, spice is oil, there's basically two houses GoT style who are against each other, political assassination attempt, backstabbing by character you barely knew, etc.

I liked a lot of things with this movie, but I'm holding out judgment for part 2.",qd6vqv

hhq39tm,"Thats a good point, but I was expecting them at some point to show the audience that shield + lasgun=boom, not necesarily nuclear. I guess I underestimated Villenue's commitment to the books lol. And I thought the breach of the shield wall was Atreides family atomics, but maybe I'm misremembering.",qd6vqv
hisqd1q,"> Hopefully they make a sequel since at the end of the book there’s a very crucial atomic shield explosion

When?  The shields were neutralized by the storm.",qd6vqv
hhqp9od,I thought the same thing but when i rewatched it (the 3rd or 4th time?) i picked up that the shield was broken by the missile that hit the thopter just before they shot at it with the lasgun. It's really easy to miss but when you look carefully you can see the  shield of the thopter failing,qd6vqv
hhpzt0t,"Exactly what I was thinking!! They get so scared from the thumper blast (in the book) but don’t care about targeting a clearly-shielded thopter in the movie.

Edit: shield, not thumper.",qd6vqv

message: The  Harkonnens  tried  to  get  in  a  shipment  of  lasguns.  We  captured
them. This may mean they’ve succeeded with other shipments. It certainly means
they don’t place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions.


>Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of
disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance
was  not  shielded.  The  fact  that  feedback  from  a  shield  would  explode  both
lasgun  and  shield  did  not  bother  the  Harkonnens.  Why?  A  lasgun-shield

kill only the gunner and his shielded target.",qd6vqv

But not every movie has some “extended cut” lying around, and then when people talk about seeing a rough assembly everyone assumes there’s some pristine longer cut all polished and ready to be seen, if only it could be released. It doesn’t work that way. Most stuff that gets cut in a movie gets cuts for *a reason*, as decided by the filmmaker.

It’s the equivalent of looking at a sculpture and then saying the the sculptor, “this is great, but I would *really* love to see the one that has more clay on it.”",qd6vqv
hj0lpkp,"No, an assembly isn’t every single take, it’s generally put together using whatever ones are noted on-set as the preferred takes. There’s some redundancy because they’re assembling multiple set-ups without any significant trimming. But that’s just the starting point, a lot of times in the course of editing they’ll end up reviewing/considering alternate takes anyway.",qd6vqv
hhzhy14,I'm hoping for a directors cut. They obviously have enough footage. Maybe there's some additional stuff that would help firm up the film.,qd6vqv
hhlkmv7,"And they missed an opportunity for a really powerful moment.

Jessica is (for her) devestated that the love of her life had suspected her of betraying him.

She only posthumously learns that it was all a ruse he was playing (he was pretending to be taken in by the Harkonnen plot to sow suspicion between the two of them) but in fact he was incapable of thinking it of her.

Very powerful moment(s)

I probably would have tried to find a way to include it, but I'm not a director with the near impossible task of trying to squeeze such a massive amount of information into a 2-3 hour movie either.",qd6vqv

I want a 7 hour megacut after part 2",qd6vqv
hhla3jm,"The past ten years or so have been so dominated by planned out franchises, I kind of forgot what it feels like to fall in love with a world and have nothing else to dive into after it ends.

hho9875,"I get that they wanted to get to Chani's character before the end of the first movie, but they really should have ended it with Leto's death and Paul and Jessica's escape into the desert. That would have given us an extra 30-40 minutes to explore Yueh's relationship with Paul and Jessica, Piter and more exposition on what mentats are, Paul's second conversation with the reverend mother, and maybe a glimpse of Feyd Rautha.",qd6vqv
hhl9uww,"I kind of forgot the second part of the book so I don't know how much they have to fit into a second movie, but I think this one would've been better by having the Harkonnen attack be the last scene. They already spent a fair amount of time world building but audiences are used to big budget TV shows now so Gurney and Duncan for example felt underdeveloped. The most underdeveloped character was the emperor and the plot suffered for it - if they'd shown him being insecure about House Atreides and plotting the entire 'come to Arrakis oh no we kill you lol' thing would've felt more logical.",qd6vqv

The atreides just sort of get killed halfway through the movie and pacing wise it feels like it comes out of nowhere.  It also felt like they were living in an absolutely empty place.  There’s no shots of the city, any kind of normal life. Even for a few seconds.  Aren’t there people in that city?  The world felt so empty 

The movie honestly didn’t work for me, i really wish it had been a series or something because there’s just not enough time to develop this story properly (even split in half)",qd6vqv

I literally read up until Jamis's funeral before watching the movie, and knew from Day 1 that it was Yueh. It's not a mystery. The plotline of ""Who is the spy?"" was and always will be useless, because if you paid any attention, it was Yueh.",qd6vqv
hhnzzla,"I pictured the city to be something like Baghdad or Beirut, not a bunch of underground bunkers with barely anyone outside.

hho8wth,"> It was somehow too drawn out and too compressed.

My feelings exactly, I really dislike the pacing.

Everything before they arrived on Arrakis was a bit slow, then it was like they just fast forwarded through (or cut completely) all the interesting and *necessary* character development and plot threads while the family was settling in. The audience barely gets to know them before the attack happens. And then everything after that just slows to a crawl.",qd6vqv
hhlx4zt,"You have to understand though that some of that is going to be reallllly hard to portray in a movie. Concessions had to be made somewhere. The videos were clearly an attempt to expedite the process of learning about the Fremen.

Humanizing the Atreides a bit more, given the pace that everything needed to be handled at, compared to the book being able to establish who they are in deta. 

Also helps paint a stark contrast against how the Harkonnens are portrayed. 



Most of the changes seem to have done to keep it sensible as a potential box office movie. Villanieve walked a helluva close line in keeping accurate to the source material. Much different approach than BR2049 I feel, which gave 0 fucks about the general audience.",qd6vqv
hhmi7dx,"I seem to remember bagpipe sounds showing up a lot as an Atreides leitmotif throughout the film. Briefly showing actual, recognizable bagpipes on screen was probably an attempt to emphasize that as connected to House Atreides. It was the same with the constant (but individually brief) shots of bull imagery. I guess they only had 2.5 hours to do an entire season's worth of Game of Thrones symbolism, so they tried to squeeze it in wherever they could.",qd6vqv

-The Dinner scene

-The Tent scene with Jessica and Paul

hhv6efh,"These are things that get fleshed out in more detail in the books, I highly recommend Dune and Dune Messiah.

The Atreides were also very well liked by the other Houses whereas the Harkonnens were pretty much despised. Emperor was worried the other houses would unite under Atreides and overthrow him and the Harkonnens. It's kind of mentioned in the movie but the Atreides fighters are much more skilled than Harkonnens, almost to the level of the Emperor's Sardaukar. This is another motivating factor for the Emperor.",qd6vqv
hhzi5o0,"House Atreides was getting too powerful, mostly because of how well they had trained their army with Gurney and Duncan. Even though they aren’t as rich as House Harkonnen, if they started training other Houses armies, the primacy of the Sardaukar would be jeopardized and would let the Landsraad tip the balance of power in their favor (and out of the Emperor’s). However, any overt move against a House would also unite the Landsraad against the Emperor. 

The Harkonnen were richer, but the only reason they could retake Arakkis by force was because the Emperor lent them his troops (Sardaukar). Additionally, the Space Guild is also United with the Emperor and Harkonnens, even though this isn’t really mentioned in the movie. They are the third pillar of power in the universe, and they control all space travel. 

Basically, the Harkonnen plan was to hoard up spice for decades, get Atreides to take over Arrakis and set them up to fail. The Landsraad all share in the profits of spice mining, regardless of who runs Arrakis, and the guild requires spice.  So when Atreides can’t produce enough spice, all 3 major players turn against them (Landsraad, Guild, and Emperor). 

In the books, the Duke has several months to try to get production up, but still fails. The movie obviously needs to accelerate this. 

Regarding your second question, the Landsraad would be OK with the Harkonnen taking over Arrakis (because of greed for more profits), but not OK with an alliance with the Emperor, as that would clearly put every House at risk of being wiped out by the Emperor. Paul realizes that he can use proof of an alliance to force the Emperor’s hand to either let Paul marry a daughter and become next in line, or face open war with the Landsraad, which would be galactic war.",qd6vqv
hi0ufmx,"Emperor was threatened because Atreides were seen as good an honorable people. He was afraid they'd unite the other houses and overthrow him for a more unified government.

Harkonnen's were just dicks and no one liked them which is why the emperor was happy to work with them as an opportunity to wipe out house atreides as well as not be threatened by the idea of them creating allied houses.",qd6vqv
hjctz0j,"The Harkonnen are rich. The Atreides were stronger militarily but more importantly were popular. Leto had more support among the noble houses than the Emperor did and the Emperor was concerned that after some political misstep, Leto could call for an uprising against him. That with the right circumstances, Leto could get more than 90% of the nobles to support him in usurping the Emperor. The Harkonnen are fabulously wealthy but everyone hates them, they wouldn't get more than a handful of other houses to support them in a bid for the throne. Their wealth was far less concerning than the popular support that Leto held. Also note that this war between the Harkonnen and Atreides significantly drained the Harkonnen coffers. The Emperor managed to weaken one potential contender for the throne while also eliminating the most immediate one.",qd6vqv
hi7x28m,This is explained later in the book that part 2 will cover.,qd6vqv
hhr80dg,"Similar tech to what Yueh (the traitor) shot Leto with. Expensive tech that can penetrate shields based on either boring action or by slowing their rate of fire to pass through I would guess. 

The wealth that the Harkonnens acquired over the 80 years of occupation is what allows them to afford such a widespread and devastating attack. Yueh lowering the shields of the city is what allowed the boring rounds or missles to make it to the ships.",qd6vqv
hi0u6fn,"I didn't think it was some kind of tech that could bore. I thought the shields just slowed velocity of things, so if you used fired projectiles the person being attacked could have the opportunity to bat them away.  We saw that with the father trying to get to the poison dart thing, and we saw it again with Duncan idaho swatting away some bullet things in the cave.

So as for the bombs going through the shields i bet they were just slowed but with nothing to bat them away they got through eventually.",qd6vqv

In the books Duncan plants a shield in the desert while the Harkonnens are using lasguns and the resulting explosion is nuclear weapons scale but it could have just killed that one ship and nothing else",qd6vqv
hi8b6bn,"So from an excerpt on wikipedia I'm still actually trying to double check (need to find the books) the lasgun-shield explosion is fairly random: 

>*Herbert, Frank (1965). Dune. Ace. pp. 145–146. ISBN 0-441-17271-7. ""Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.""

I still believe they were fairly reckless using a cutteray but the risks may have been low (fremen don't have shield and you don't put up a shield while a lasgun is used unless you have a deathwish) which may have been fine for the fanatical sardaukar (Paul would have been dead in most scenarii)...",qd6vqv

When the Baron had him killed he knew then that his wife was also dead and therefore her suffering over. Yueh also knew he wouldn't get close to the Baron which is why he put the poison tooth in the Dukes mouth and not his own because the Baron would want to gloat over the Duke before killing him. Oh, and Yueh also sent Duncan Idaho to the area where Paul and lady Jessica would be found thus saving them for the Duke. This movie is amazing but still so much left out.",qd6vqv
hhl3gms,"Yeah, he had a lot more lines in the book. Thufir and Gurney and Dr. Yueh are like his teachers. Even Jessica. You even get to hear their thoughts,, which is always a big no-no in movies.

It truncates some parts (the beginning when Paul meets with his Gurney, Duncan, Thufir, and Yueh), and really summarizes some parts (marriage to Chani and pretty much all the Fremen stuff), and omits a few parts (like Feyd Rautha's gladiator fight and Harkonnen political party), but ultimately, it's super faithful. Like they keep the same dialogue and inner monologs. Like when Jessica and Yueh are talking and she eliminates him as a traitor because if his wife. That conversation is almost word for word. 

They talk about the weirding way and all that stuff. They really don't try to hide anything under the rug. 

Compare this to the new movie. It's a ***much better*** movie, but it does so by basically ignoring all the cringe. Like where is Gurney's minstreling with his baliset? It's not in Denis' movie, but it is in Lynch's!

hhpzcc3,that was good but idk if dropping such a heavy red herring was worth it lol… it’s just a big “hah you thought you knew what’s going to happen but im smarter than you” moment,qd6vqv

hhn153j,Would have played out like the Sherlock Holmes fight scene. Which seems uhhh not great in this context.,qd6vqv
hhv4u3t,"At least he does that in a way. In the fight with Jamis, he has a vision of how Jamis would kill him. He ends up killing Jamis the same way, or at least it looked that way to me - a sidestep and a stab in the kidney.

When I was watching, I felt like it was supposed to reflect learning their fighting style through precognition, and doing it in a more show-don't-tell kind of way.

Not that anything about grappling and stabbing someone was explicitly Fremen. Just that the parallel seemed intentional.",qd6vqv
hhn4jwd,"I thought the carryalls were amazing. All the ships, really.",qd6vqv
hhv3xmv,"If I remember right, and I probably don't because it's been a long time, it's because Arrakis has a very weak/nonexistent magnetic field. It's why Duncan gives Paul the special clockwork compass that tracks the moon.

It's also used in the book as a reason why flying things need extra help. The technology must rely partly on magnetic fields.

The carry-alls can't lift a crawler without inflating giant balloons. The 'thopters can fly, but maybe not very fast/well without the wings. There's certainly nothing on Arrakis like Duncan's fast-as-fuck Flying Dorito from Caladan.

Like a lot of the tech in Dune, there's some kind of convenient reason for why they have to do things in the coolest, weirdest way possible.",qd6vqv

i'm not sure i understood the intent.",qd6vqv
hhtf3ma,Yea Deadline asked Ann Sarnoff about a sequel and she said that if you watch the movie you have your answer with how it ends. Ends with them saying that this is just the beginning so I think that's a pretty straightforward answer. Unless it does TERRIBLE in the box office it'll get greenlit,qd6vqv

hhq244x,Denis was able to perfectly capture the essence of what Ridley Scott created and then expand and improve on it.  And he did the same thing here with Dune.  It felt like he took little things here and there from the David Lynch version and made it better and fit more into the world.,qd6vqv

So much of the sound design is lost on the small screen. First movie I'd seen in a theater since before covid too so that made it extra fun. Did not miss watching a movie around other people though,qd6vqv
hhla87p,"That doesn't really have much to do with the aperture because the raw footage was surely blasted with light, and color graded in post to be dark.

The movie started with his dad telling him, “true leaders are called to lead and don’t turn away, not those who only desire to lead” or something like that and it ended with him resolved to follow through his fathers plan for their empire.  

I dunno, I guess I don’t see it too far from how Fellowship of the Ring was handled.",qd6vqv
hhtku80,"Yeah, the book is a little jerky at that part, too. Iirc, right after that there's either a 2 or 5 year jump. (Mild spoiler- the damn book mostly ends on a cliffhanger, too)",qd6vqv

hhlsswc,I loved that part. Just seeing his eyes roll up and back real quick was a nice little touch.,qd6vqv
hi31i9o,"Kynes literally said nothing about turning Arrakis into a paradise.

Recovery of water was not mentioned at all and they skipped the ""I was a friend of Jamis"" ceremony which was a pretty important point. 

The marriage line makes no sense in the film because they never discuss the fact that she is a concubine, or why she is a concubine, until the one dumb throwaway line about marriage out of nowhere. Do you know why he didn't marry her? No, because you haven't read the books. But guess what, it's kind of important.

I dont get how or why you can defend this. Especially if you haven't read the books, you don't know what you're talking about or why that is important.",qd6vqv

hhl5g66,"It’s only a shock to the Bene Gesserit. To the rest of the world it was normal. The only people that are aware of the breeding program is them.

Lady Jessica was the result of one.",qd6vqv

hhm3gd3,I thought she was born into the Bene Gesserit and didn't even know her own heritage.,qd6vqv
hhlbr5q,This. The book says exactly this. They are not married because it leaves option of political marriage open.,qd6vqv

hhosom4,Yah I almost mentioned Paul to further elaborate but didn't want to get into spoilers.,qd6vqv
hhlgo1g,"The movie correctly understands that the most important thing is emotional impact, not clarity of background details.

""No, son, I loved your father, but he had to remain eligible for political alliances"" is just an information dump.

Leto's *last lines* to his partner and mother of his children being ""I should have married you"" is much more emotionally meaningful. It's a line filled with longing, regret, and love. And it makes it about them, not about other people.",qd6vqv
hhnhg1t,"No, they left the option open in case it was politically convenient to do so.",qd6vqv
hhp1w1g,"Nah not always the case when there are royals involved. I like watching historical Asian dramas and a lot of times in those there will be a lot of concubines, but there are a lot of rules for who can actually become his wife. Have to be of noble birth, or sometimes even can't have any scars. Really.",qd6vqv
hhu2mz1,"That's sort of correct...she was the result of the Bene Gesserit breeding program and her father *was* from a noble house (not spoiling here), however she was raised from birth by the Bene Gesserit and was in no way considered a ""noble"" despite her lineage, as it was Bene Gesserit tradition to keep the lineages of those in their breeding program secret.  So it's not just that she's a Bene Gesserit that keeps her from being noble...it's that her lineage is altogether unknown by her or anyone other than those involved with the Bene Gesserit breeding program and therefore she would have no claim to said house.",qd6vqv
hhlhsmq,Because it’s not true. She’s was ordered to birth a daughter.. to marry a Harkonnen (Feyd I guess) in order to heal the rift between to two houses and to potentially propagate the Kwisatz Haderach.,qd6vqv
hhljjot,"While I have no doubt GRRM read Dune, calling it an inspiration would be a stretch. The machinations of European nobility long predated either work. The most direct inspiration for Game of Thrones was the English War of the Roses, where the various noble houses jockeyed for power in the wake of the fall of a mad king.",qd6vqv
hhkn7jc,Exactly this. It was purely political/strategic. Not a reflection on his feelings for Jessica.,qd6vqv
hhl5lnb,This. He and Jessica literally discuss it in the book.,qd6vqv
hhlley3,I think they also included that line for later purposes too that are revealed in part 2.,qd6vqv
hhphffp,Yep. It said so in the book,qd6vqv
hhl5t7m,She wasn’t really. Her motives for giving him a son were purely love. Just like her having Ali was  out of grief. She wanted something to remember him by. For all of her political scheming when it came to the Duke Jessica straight up loved the guy.,qd6vqv
hhkucnx,"Spoil something for me, is her bun in the oven something special? Like ""psych! you were only the practice messiah!""",qd6vqv

hhpfpps,"Yeah, they've only showed them carrying Jamis's body away with them into the desert at the end, not the whole part with his funeral and >!them distilling his water and giving it to Paul!<, which could easily be early on in Part Two.",qd6vqv
hhtnpnw,"Oh, that makes sense. Still think it would have been better included, but hopefully we get it the next film. Also, hopefully we get a next film...",qd6vqv
hit4dhl,The water is harvested already.  They are divying up Jamis' possessions as a funeral ceremony.,qd6vqv

hhm2l18,"It's a pivotal scene too and the movie helped me realize just *how* pivotal.

Paul eventually gets trapped by his terrible purpose, but he has a way out there, and it's to go rogue and flee. Instead he is immediately thinking of revenge and how he can exploit his new position. It's already too late.",qd6vqv
hhlh10k,"Yea but we have many more moments with him in the book, in this it seems like ha completely changed in like a day",qd6vqv
hhvr0ok,"I actually appreciated that. It didn’t feel too spectacular, it felt more real and grounded. And that’s, I think, what you’re supposed to feel at that time. It’s Paul’s first time fighting without a shield, and his first real fight where he had to kill someone. I thought it portrayed the shift in mood well, and it wasn’t riddled with jump cuts and unnecessary additions. Paul is supposed to be the far superior fighter, the only reason it takes so long is because he doesn’t know he must kill Jamis (and the lack of a shield).",qd6vqv
hhlfnha,In the book he’s already had the pivotal spice branching future seeing thing. He’s trying to avoid the golden path and sees becoming emperor as a way to do this.,qd6vqv

But in this setting, people have been honing their fighting abilities with regard to shields for hundreds (perhaps thousands?) of years, and so everyone is used to swinging fast to get to the shield, but arresting their swing at the last moment to be slow enough to penetrate.

The book actually makes a big deal out of that ingrained training during Paul's fight with Jamis.  Rather than continuing to bring his blade to Jamis' throat and deliberately stop like we saw in the film, the book fight had Jamis escaping Paul's attacks because Paul just instinctually slowed down at the last second because he was trained exclusively with shields.",qd6vqv

Similarly, Harkonnen is a Finnish name iirc, and Vladimir as the Baron's first name is clearly Slavic, so also there's a European association.

Interestingly, the Emperor is named Shaddam (like Saddam Hussein), and he's called the Padishah Emperor  which iirc is what the ruler of Iran's title was pre-Revolution, so Herbert himself intended there to be non-European influences in the leadership",qd6vqv

Between the surprise attack, being disadvantaged by being in Arrakis, and House Harkonnen allying with the Imperium army House Atreides stood no chance.

Until they started calling themselves the great houses in the second half of the movie (when they were doing exposition after they ran off with the ecologist), I don’t think I appreciated that they were these storied rival houses that also could’ve plausibly been a threat to the emperor. I just saw them as glorified border tribes having a spat over spice (the importance of which was said, but not at all shown- water as well was undersold based on what I’ve heard from readers). The opening exposition had me seeing Bautista’s group as kind of pirates/rogues rather than say a house Lannister or Stark. And Atreites didn’t have the gravitas I think they’re meant to. Like when when someone in another house knew Atreites right hand man/trainer as a legendary fighter, I was surprised by that, because it came late and that expectation of them being this well known revered house of fighters hadn’t been made. 

I don’t know what’s coming so maybe this isn’t plausible, but I think I would’ve made the opening intro narrated by Zendaya about her people’s belief in a messiah instead of their struggles with the colonizers, to set it up as a Chosen One narrative. Then used the first part of the movie to tell the story of spice’s importance, the mistreatment of the natives, the brutality of Baron’s people, and their unceremonious surprise withdrawal by the emperor,
then built up the world of the Atreites house, making it clearer the place they hold in the universe showing more of what they’re about or their history, that they’re a big deal who it makes sense the emperor would fear, maybe have a history with Baron also, and then dedicated the final third to a weightier arrival on Dune and fight for the city, with the ending coming after Paul and mother escape the sand storm. Seems like that would’ve been a better pace with a logical climax nearer to the end, and a reasonable cliff hanger. Then the finding the fremen and opening fight seems like it would’ve worked as a good start to part 2 of a trilogy, instead of halfway through a two parter.

Or guild navigators. The movie says they use spice to travel space but they just do a jump cut from one planet to another and don't even touch them.

The spice itself is largely ignored except as something that's worth a lot of money as a travel tool and a few bits about it being psychoactive. They don't really touch on its impact on the minds of people or the common use of it by the families (except for the little platter of it that Paul was served I guess).

All of these things are the weirder and more imaginative things that made Dune so unique, and while I won't totally fault the movie on skipping over them (focusing too much on them helped sink Lynch's movie IMO), it definitely robs the movie of some of the character that inspired so much cracked out crazy art in the past, from Jodorowsky's to Lynch's to Villanueve's now.

I don't really know what could have been cut to free up 15 or so minutes more for it. The movie really did hit just about every major development in the book for the part it covered.

This is actually why so many characters in Dune wield two swords when they fight. A big one that is made for defense and smacking your opponent around, and the knife to land the killing blow. The trick to getting through the shield though is that the implement has to go slow, but maintain it's speed. The shield is always pushing back against it, but things with low kinetic energy can eventually slide through. Sitting on a chair, no problem. Catching a thrown ball would take some practice to account for the resistance, but doable. But a bullet would be instantly repelled, because once it met resistance it no longer has anything pushing it forward. It's like an ""equal but opposite reaction"" kind of situation.

hk58883,"> I haven't read the books but if all this is true, this movie desperately needed this explained like WAY more obviously, and prior to the attack not after.

Yeah I felt this was a criticism I had too. The way the book sets up the fall of House Atreides is much better just because they have a lot more time to explain. A few things: 

* As the guy above mentioned, such an overwhelming attack was not foreseen due to the cost. In the book the Baron mentions how it took 70 years worth of profits from running Arrakis to pay for the spacing guild transport. Real world example would be like 70 years of profits from all the oil in the middle east. It's an astronomical number. I agree, the movie didn't explain the guild's monopoly basically at all. 

* The Atreides and the Harkonnens have been squabbling for generations but it's been settled mostly through subterfuge. Assassinations, plots, political maneuvers, etc. In the book Duke Leto does mention that he predicts the Emperor will help out the Harkonnens with troops, but like I said he underestimated the sheer number of them. 

* The Duke's plan to overcome this was to recruit and train the Fremen to be soldiers. Like many things, in the book it's much more fleshed out but I think in the movie he says ""I just wish there was more time"". The Duke wasn't about to get his counterplay up and running before the Harkonnens came down on them.

I liked the movie a lot, and it's probably about as good of an adaptation you can make in 2.5 hours but this is why pretty much every Dune fan wanted a Game of Thrones type series.

Yeah it is hinted at but a little later on, and it's not hinted for the sake of the readers but for the sake of the other characters not suspecting him.

A couple chapters on (after Chapter 2's reveal) Yueh confides in Lady Jessica by telling her that the Harkonnen's killed his wife. He tells Jessica this so that she wouldn't continue probing him and look into his mind and find out the truth that he actually means to betray the Atreides. There's one point where Dr Yueh is pretty much sweating bullets because he thinks he's going to get caught by this witch.

Jamis' challenge to Paul was a major event in the book, both he and his mother tried desperately to persuade him and even trick him into taking it back. They both knew Paul was a far superior fighter and didn't want Jamis to have to die from his stupid pride and hurt feelings at being disarmed by a ""child"".

And when the fight happens, Paul is extremely emotional over having to kill a man he didn't want to kill. And Jessica hammers it home with a massive guilt trip right after the knife goes in with ""Look what you've done! You're a murderer! Does that make you feel good?"" It speaks volumes about how she is trying to raise her son to be a good person knowing what challenges he's going to face because of her decisions. It also goes a long way toward establishing how she has been emotionally manipulating him all his life.

That scene would have been a perfect opportunity to develop the two main characters for the second movie, but it felt weak, and rushed, and came out badly. Then to be told ""it's just the beginning"" before cutting to credits - like no dude, you skipped completely over the real beginning,",qd6vqv

Emperor's, like kings, are hereditary unless there happens to be a popular uprising and they are disposed. The bene gesserit are supposed to be neutral but they hold a lot of power and serve a lot of functions within the universe. They are basically Puppet Masters guiding Humanity for the purpose of their selective breeding program .

himnq3u,"10,000 years ago mankind was at the peak of technology, eventually there was a revolt and a galactic-wide war between Humans and A.I happened where tens of billions of people died. The war lasted about 100 years after which the leaders and religious leaders of humanity vowed to never make a machine in the likeness of a human mind. So anything with a CPU was banned, even basic things like calculators were banned, those who broke the law received a punishment of death. The A.I war (known as the Butlerian Jihad) effected humans so much that they distrusted the use of A.I. This led to a large technological reversal of the entire human civilization.

However humans still felt the urge to progress and evolve, so instead they set up institutions where certain people would hone their skills to inhuman levels and they became known as Mentats (those people who's eyes turn white when they calculate stuff). These humans were pushed to develop minds that are equivalent to super computers, so that humanity could replace the absence of A.I computers with human computers.

The Bene Gesserit was also another party from the Butlerian Jihad days that developed their ways, both mentally and mystically.

The Spacing guild was another party from that same age, who started setting up their monopoly of Space Travel, and they developed a way where they would force feed Spice to certain individuals, and those individuals would then have limited foresight abilities which would allow them to safely come out of Faster Than Light travel. Usually in sci-fi fiction like star wars and star trek they would use super computers to plot their warp drive coordinates so that they won't accidentally warp into the centre of a planet. Obviously in Dune, AI is banned so the Spacing Guild use these individuals who are force fed spice and make them their pilots to navigate through space. These pilots take on this role for so long that eventually they mutate from such overuse of the spice and have to be put in tanks filled with liquid spice and they're just swimming in, constantly being fed it, and their sole purpose 24/7 is to pilot the ship.

**TL:DR In distant past humans have war with AI. After winning war, humans ban the use of AI everywhere and as a way to not have humanity fall into permanent technology dark age and devolve, they basically encouraged human disciplines that emulated machines in order to replace them. So stuff like Mentats, Bene Gesserit, etc Don't be fooled, Mentats aren't just clever people, they are super clever to inhuman levels.**",qd6vqv
hilnu8t,"So the film really needed to explain a bit about Leto and Jessica: the Bene Gesserit send out their agents into the Great Houses to be concubines. From there, the women are meant to have children-or not-and basically be what the Bene Gessetit Orded and their House needs them to be. One Bene Gesserit may be sent to a House and basically just be a bodyguard or a teacher and bare a daughter or two who will be married off to someone specific. They are also meant to be advisors and provide a calm and rational perspective. 

Jessica is somewhat unique because she is Leto's wife in all but name. She can't be addressed as Dutchess, but it is expected for people below a certain class to treat her like they would any high-born lady. She was sent to the Atreides so she would bare a daughter, who would marry into the Harkonnens. This would not only lead to a messiah at some point, but it would also provide stability between two rival Houses. 

Why doesn't she bare a daughter? In the book, the simple reason is that she grows to love Leto dearly. He wants a son, just a normal son, and despite everything, she resolves to give him that. He knows this is a huge deal, which reinforces his resolve to have her as his wife in all but name. He can't bring himself to hurt her by marrying another woman.",qd6vqv

To be fair, the book is like this too. But you have the appendices and other books that expand on the history.

However 99% of that is just lore that isn't relevant to the main story. For example this question of yours:

> Like the movie is set so far in the future so why is the technology seemingly so limited?

With regards to why computers aren't used? That is more lore details that isn't really necessary for the main plot. This isn't spoilers, the history is part of another book unrelated to this main story. The reasons for there not being computers is that 10,000 years ago, at the peak of human technology there was a war where humans fought against an uprising of AI robots. The war was widespread across the universe, billions of people died and it lasted 100 years. In the end the humans won and the leaders and religious leaders of humanity came together to vow that they shall **never create a machine in the likeness of a human mind**, at the risk of someone privately developing AI again they banned every thinking machine. Basically anything with a CPU was banned, even calculators. Punishment of breaking this law was death (that's how serious that AI war was). So that's why they don't use advance computers, that's why mentats exist (Guys with flickering white eyes). These particular humans were trained to inhuman levels to act as human computers. So theoretically speaking, the $10 trillion computers at NASA are replaced with humans with much more developed brains than normal humans, that can calculate at the same level as the NASA super computers can.

Now all of that above, is just lore. It's not really relevant to the main story. It's a bit like Gandalf in LOTR. Gandalf is a wizard, yet we barely see him use magic. You get so many people asking ""why doesn't Gandalf use Magic, he's a wizard for god sake!"". There are books outside of LOTR that explains why Gandalf can't use magic/doesn't use magic that often, once again these are outside of the 3 LOTR books. Is it crucial to the story? No. Which is why it's left out in the LOTR movies. Same thing goes for Dune in this case. The Butlerian Jihad (The name of the AI war) isn't relevant to the main Dune story, it's just interest background lore.

> It's weird though because the film spent so much time explaining certain things but then completely glossed over other aspects which you would think would be more important.

Trust me, everything he spent time on describing is relevant to the main story/the narrative. The worms are described because they not only give an idea of the planets ecosystem (because they are not just worms, they are part of why Dune is Dune), but they also play a bigger role a little later in the story. Even the ""annoying"" (which i've heard some people say) constant visions have relevance.

> I certainly would have liked a more extensive introduction sequence akin to LOTR and less glossing over of important plot points.

Thing with LOTR is that majority of the stuff was relevant to the story. The prologue at the start of Fellowship expands on the lore, but it is  also relevant because it tells the story of the Ring (the main object). They could have done a prologue for Dune showing a 5 minute briefing of the Butlerian Jihad (AI war, 10000 years ago) but there is no object from that time period that carries over to Dune, like the Ring in LOTR. The only thing that it does is fulfil someone's curiosity. Having said that, they could still cover it in future films? I mean even LOTR, each movie starts off with its own prologue taken from different parts of Middle-earth's time.",qd6vqv

hif2h2e,"> but not the lack of guns

They kind of do explain the guns:  ""only the slow moving object penetrates"" is what Gurney says during his sparring session with Paul

> or the lack of computers

It's not terribly important and would basically be impossible to explain without a horribly clumsy exposition dump.  And since people *fear* AI, not just the thing itself but also just talking and thinking about them...

> Could they not have explained this when the meet the Fremen, of when Paul and Jessica have to survive in the desert for the first time?

The narrative reason for this is that Kynes has no reason to help Paul and Jessica without this season.  It's the moment that convinces her, someone who has spent considerable time off-planet and in the company of the powerful houses, that her religion from birth might be accurate, and therefore that she has an obligation to assist them.  Otherwise, she lets them die in the desert or get captured by the sardakur, and stays loyal to the emperor.",qd6vqv
hif5y3w,"> But why explain the suit, but not the lack of guns or the lack of computers?

The suit explains how the Fremen's exist in the middle of the desert. I think that at least needs to be clarified considering the next movie is all about them and half of the book is all about Fremen.

Also Gurney Halleck explains in the first scenes where he's training Paul that low velocity is the only thing that can penetrate the shield. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect the dots and realise why projectile weapons aren't used that often. That's one characteristic of Denis Villeneuve, he doesn't connect the dots himself, he uses one thing to indirectly explain something else (In this case why guns aren't used)

With regards to why computers aren't used? That is more lore details that isn't really necessary for the main plot. The reasons for there not being computers is that 10,000 years ago, at the peak of human technology there was a war where humans fought against an uprising of AI robots. The war was widespread across the universe, billions of people died and it lasted 100 years. In the end the humans won and the leaders and religious leaders of humanity came together to vow that they shall never create a machine in the likeness of a human mind, at the risk of someone privately developing AI again they banned every thinking machine. Basically anything with a CPU was banned, even calculators. Punishment of breaking this law was death (that's how serious that AI war was). So that's why they don't use advance computers, that's why mentats exist (Guys with flickering white eyes). These particular humans were trained to inhuman levels to act as human computers. So the $10 trillion computers at NASA are replaced with humans with much more developed brains than normal humans, that can calculate the same stuff as the NASA computers.

Now all of that above, is just lore. It's not really relevant to the main story. It's a bit like Gandalf in LOTR. Gandalf is a wizard, yet we barely see him use magic. You get so many people asking why, when there is an explanation in books outside of LOTR that explains why Gandalf can't use magic/doesn't use magic that often. Is it crucial to the story? No. Which is why it's left out in the LOTR movies. Same thing goes for Dune in this case.

> Could they not have explained this when the meet the Fremen, of when Paul and Jessica have to survive in the desert for the first time?

So, not really since the Bulterian Jihad (the name of the AI war) happened 10,000 years ago. Why would people still be randomly talking about it now? If it's only there for curiosities sake and not crucial to the main story.

> I don't feel that part is even necessary. The Atreides, and we the viewers, already know the emperor might be trying to screw them.

The scene in Geidi Prime is crucial because we find out WHY the Emperor is joining forces with Harkonnens. Not only do we see the Baron scheming with the Reverend Mother (which is a big surprise considering she was just with Jessica and Paul), but we find out the Emperor is aiding Harkonnen because ""he's a jealous man, a dangerous jealous man"". Jealous of what? In the next movie (where they will actually show the Emperor) we will find out jealous of what! But at least for now we have a small snipet of motives as to why the Emperor is going against Atreides, he's jealous of Atreides or Leto.

> I still think they could have structured this better, without taking away from the important information.
>
> Also like I said I'm not an experienced critic or anything.

I think there's room for improvement, sure. And yeah maybe they could have structured and rounded off a few of the edges, but I don't think much needs to be adjusted. But this is coming from someone who is used to Villenueves way of film. I like a wide range of films from comedic action of Marvel/DC films to slow paced films where you're essentially bathing in atmosphere and the story just soaks through you gradually for the next 2-3 hours (like Blade Runner 2049). So yeah, maybe because i'm just more used to it I can't see that much more room for re-structuring (I will admit, it does need a little though).",qd6vqv

But having not read the novel I wonder how much of that is the movie’s fault and how much of it stems from the book.

But it’s very weird how first Paul’s mother subjected him to a test that could result in him dying with no preparation and she seems upset about it but just kind of accepts it, and then Paul later almost gets assassinated and his dad makes a joke about it the next morning.

The doctor is WebMD. Even the Bene Gesserit serve a technical function as bodyguards, therapists, broodmares, whatever. People in this universe are very much treated as things by the people in power.

And this is why House Atredies is so beloved, because the Duke Leto sees people as people. While there is the larger Atredies family, his core ""family"" really is the group we saw in the film. They are loyal to Leto because even if he advanced them because of their skills and abilities, he still treats them with respect, dignity, and love. 

Duncan Idaho isn't like the noble characters, who are obviously genetically important to the plans of the Bene Gesserit and other groups. He really is just a smart guy who can fight really, really well. He's not noble at all. But Leto still treats him with a ton of respect and so, in return, Duncan is very loyal. 

Also, in the book, he is secretly in love with Jessica, who is married to the Duke in all but name. Part of his love for Paul comes down to the fact that he loves her. It's a small plot-point because he keeps falling for women who look like her in later books, but they never get together.",qd6vqv

So if Leto got married and had a son, Paul wouldn't be the main heir, but probably would still have power and get something nice and his family would become a cadet branch of the main line. 

Many royal families in Europe had cadet branch lines that ran parallel to the main line and would inherit if the main line went extinct.

In nations where rulers had many concubines (but no wife) the rulers could pick whoever the wanted from the 20+ sons they'd have. Which is why concubines are known from being murdering, backstabbing, manipulative, and tough because if they don't get their kid on the throne or somewhere secure chances are they will be killed.

Which is what the Turks did after Mehmed II in the later part of the 1400s passed this law:

>Whichever of my sons inherits the sultanate, it behooves him to kill his brothers to preserve the order of the world. Most jurists have approved this; let action be taken accordingly.

Too many civil wars had been fought due to too many sons. But the Ottomans also didn't allow maimed people to rule so sometimes they would just cut off your ear, nose or blind you.

So it shows us two things, her fear and her extreme self control. I think this helps show us that as a BG she has way more control/power than a regular person and so when we see her use the voice, and fight later it's not coming out of no where. Which is also why I think they added the scene of her practicing the voice with Paul.

Then during/around the part where they sit at night in the tent, she starts to question how strong he really is and there's a shift in roles where she becomes the follower and paul becomes the leader (as he has more say over what to do and how to survive). Then near the end of the book, she actually is afraid of her son, because she knows of his true potential.

So yeah, while she's some powerful witch to most the inhabitants of Dune, her son is her weak spot to the point she doubts whether his choices are morally right.

The crying and emotional sections of Lady Jessica in the film? that's done in areas when she is in private and no one is around. It's a replacement of the internal monologue from the books (where she actually thinks thoughts in her head that would be considered weak - doubt in herself, her son, etc) but she doesn't show it. Here in the movie, because internal monologue would look stupid, they show her thoughts through her expression but retained her powerful image by not showing those expressions to people around her.",qd6vqv

hjchhhe,"I agree and feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else rolling in and raving it’s the best thing they ever saw. I have seen „masterpiece“ and „extraordinary“ thrown around a lot… to each their own? It was good and I enjoyed the world building, there was beautiful shots but I was never emotionally engaged with any one character or arc. I watched with my family and they all fell asleep during it. We are all big sci-fi fans so it definitely wasn’t the genre that lost them. I did think a few times throughout this is a movie made for the big screen so perhaps the impact was lost on us. The score was distracting with the loud battle cries and the sound editing was really poor as the score would be overpowering and then the actors were inaudible. It was ok, not sure if I am interested enough to see the rest when it comes out but perhaps some rainy day with a nice wood fire. I wasn’t a big fan of blade runner 2049 either so perhaps Villaneuve’s Storytelling just isn’t for me. Happy so many people enjoy it though! Keep on enjoying!",qd6vqv

And being a banished prince whose house has just fallen. How are we saying that’s not conflict when his entire people were murdered ? Also I don’t see how Duncan was over hyped when he killed Sadukar left and right in that hallway. I think in the lore he kills 17.  Lastly, the Atreides were killed because the emperor wanted them killed. Gurney trained an amazing army, but it obviously couldn’t stand against the situation they were put in.

hahaha.  brutal.

> It's also really weird that Zendaya's character keeps popping up in his visions and then she literally doesn't do anything for the plot when she finally shows up.

I think there's a few reasons for that.  First, the visions are to reinforce that Paul is experiencing something real, and that they're getting more frequent and more detailed.  Second, when they finally meet it shows Paul is infact seeing real futures, but not in a concrete way.

For a movie I think you have to be more in the face of the audience:

* Pauls dreams of the Jihad were bloodless and sterile, they should have been terrible nightmares. There is no way we go from a couple guys raising flags over a green Hill on caladan to space Hitler.

* Just as in Lynch the Baron is physically disgusting and vile. Why not make him more appealing so that the audience is less certain about who is good and who is bad.

* And similarly Paul is too nice and too sweet. Perhaps he should be a little entitled and more cutthroat. 

The whole first film should have been building to the fight with Jamie and in particular the decision to live and bring about the Jihad or die and leave the universe in peace... Instead it's an afterthought with a short dream sequence thrown in. I don't think most if the audience will understand.",qd6vqv

I even thought the costumes where a but cheap looking. The whole thing visually felt emotionally detached to me, but always curious how everything is a choice from the director- in terms of tone, style. I want to give it another chance but honestly the heavy cgi thing really took me out of the movie. If I wanted to watch a Marvel film for all cgi, I would- I understand it’s scifi and in the future. And some elements were necessary to tell the story with CGI, but even Star Wars (specifically older ones, not necessarily newer series) uses a lot of physical sets & real world sets that make everything feel more realistic and immersive. I Hope that makes sense. No disrespect to anyone who liked those elements. Just personally for me, it put up a wall into interest into their world and it’s a problem I feel across the movie industry. Ironic a bit since I feel like this movie/book sort of touches on humans over-reliance of technology and capitalism and encouraging the old way of living/doing things.",qd6vqv

hho2kfq,"I'm not really sure how you could even fit LGBT representation into it, the ""good guys"" are pretty small number of people and they all can't really be changed.

hid1tom,Some of it was explained. Gurney Halleck explains about the slow velcoity required to break through the shield during training at the start. The stuff about the laser guns isn't relevant to the story and is just extra lore. But you could assume from what Gurney said that if only low velocity objects can go through the shield then it makes sense that high velocity projectiles would be reflected.,qd6vqv

Likely not, and that's if they even knew what had happened.  Within the houses, though Leto is very popular, not all houses are aligned with him, many favor the Harkkonens.  And additionally, the entire attack gets framed initially as something of a false flag operation--the Harkkonens make it seem as if they weren't responsible for the attack, but the Fremen were, and therefore they are justified in returning and reclaiming what used to be theirs.",qd6vqv

Limited warfare, ""wars of assassins"", between the Great Houses is an expected part of the culture in this setting. There's nothing ""wrong"" about the Harkonnens sabotaging and assassinating the Atreides, it's the expected result of the situation. 

The slightly shady part is the Emperor rigging the situation to give the Harkonnens an advantage (since they had had Dune for so long, they have the chance to set up all kinds of traps and sabotage for the Atreides, it's like a home field advantage).

>The Fremen have secretly mastered a way to ride sandworms across the desert. First, a worm is lured by the vibrations of a thumper device. When it surfaces, the lead worm-rider runs alongside it and snares one of its ring-segments with a special ""maker hook"". The hook is used to pry open the segment, exposing the soft inner tissue to the abrasive sand. To avoid irritation, the worm will rotate its body so the exposed flesh faces upwards, lifting the rider with it. Other Fremen may then plant additional hooks for steering, or act as ""beaters"", hitting the worm's tail to make it increase speed. A worm can be ridden for several hundred kilometers and for about half a day, at which point it will become exhausted and sit on the open desert until the hooks are released, whereupon it will burrow back down to rest. Worm-riding is used as a coming-of-age ritual among the Fremen, (*dune sequel movie spoilers ahead, after the events of Dune 2021*) >!and Paul's riding and controlling a giant sandworm cements him as a Fremen leader.!<",qd6vqv

The Kyne character also said there’s water deep below the surface, so I assumed that since they knew about it, they could also somehow access it in small amount. I didn’t realize there was absolutely no accessible water on the planet at all. 

I thought water was like oil- it’s valuable, but not completely unattainable and their society had figured out how to survive on what they had.

And even if I did realize all of that, I would’ve had any more questions, like why don’t these huge ships bring millions of gallons of water, or complete Kyne’s project to access the planet’s water. However, people in these comments have said it would kill the worms and the worms make the special spice so that makes more sense. The movie didn’t explain that at all. 

I’m guessing you watched the movie with some familiarity of Dune. I went into this completely blind. I didn’t know anything about the plot, just that Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya starred in it, and it was also video game and a book. I didn’t even know about the 80s movie until halfway through when my husband made a comment. 

And from someone who knew NOTHING about Dune, they didn’t do a great job of explaining exactly how scarce and precious water is on that planet. To be honest, I STILL don’t quite get it.

You people are like LotR fans that wanted Peter Jackson to throw in all the details of LotR, like Tom Bombadil, instead of actually recognizing that film is a visual medium so certain things need to be displayed through the actions and story and superfluous things need to be cut.

Do we need to know about Yeuh's breaking his training in order to betray Atreides? Not really. Did we need to spend an agonizingly long time trying to root out the traitor? Nope. We didn't really need that in the book, either, especially since we already knew Yeuh was the traitor and Atreides was 100% going to be betrayed. Was it interesting? Sure.

This is a fucking movie. Not a book. We don't have the luxury of a character's thought processes and internal emotions. The actor and director have to convey this through visuals. Like, if we had Dumbledore's internal monologue, maybe he did scream at Harry ""Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?!"", but in actuality said it calmly. In the movie, it would do us no good to see Dumbledore actually say it calmly, because we know internally he wanted to scream.

And she said, ‘He’s losing it.’ And I said my father was getting a richer planet.

That's why it was so important in the book to have Paul's naming at that moment, because his shedding tears for Jamis and his acceptance to the troop at that moment sets him irrevocably on his path - even if he were to die and never reach Sietch Tabr, those in the troop who witnessed the events would carry out the jihad in his name.",qd6vqv

>Furthermore, if you delve into the books and the workings of the Holtzman shields, they can be dialed to certain frequencies to allow things to pass through at different speeds (if I recall correctly, the average allows for speeds of lesser than 6-9cm/sec to penetrate). Gases will pass through so you can breathe, but the novel makes it clear that there is still somewhat of a filter effect - gas, air, passes through slightly slower than normal, sort of like wearing a mask. Sounds are slightly muffled, and in Paul's training fight with Gurney, it's mentioned:

>""The air within the shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish.""

>Fighting with a shield means your air interchange is stifled slightly, making it more and more difficult to breathe the longer and more strenuous your activity.

2. The abysmal preparation of the Attredies for what hit them was horrible. Don't they have a CIA whose entire job is to prevent this type of instant collapse in the face of adversity?

3. Paul is completely unrelatable

hhnazds,His visions were all possible outcomes in different timelines basically is what I got from it.  In the book Paul can “see” the future but not in a linear sense it’s just a jumbled up mess of what can happen if he does certain things a certain way all leading to an inevitable Jihad or his death.  If things had played out just slightly different Jamis could have accepted him as freman and been a mentor but things went the other way and Paul kills him.  Either way Jamis was destined to teach Paul lessons about the desert,qd6vqv

I suppose that's why they inserted the line where Jessica explains that Paul has never killed anyone before. He still doesn't want to, but he has to.

It's notable that, at the beginning, he says various things like he's ""not in the mood"" or he ""just woke up"" or the usual reasons we all give for not rising to a challenge or giving something 100%, but by the end he is rather clear-minded and composed for someone who does have a breakdown earlier that day/yesterday (in the tent).

But it mostly came off as a rushed ""meh, okay this can be your entrance test to the community; check that box off"". 

I will admit that there's potential they just chopped this sub-arc in half and will finish it out in the sequel at the water claiming ceremony.

The Beast Rabban was the worst downgrade for me.

I watched it yesterday and thought the same. What I like about the early chapters of the book is the importance of characters - that essentially only live for a blink of an eye - in shaping the perception of the main characters, their relationships, and setting the tone heading into (and after) the attack. The film relied more on exposition than setting the tone and making you actually feel during the beginning due to the compromises and pacing, in my opinion.

I did have a little confusion about a few small things. The persona shields for example. They made it clear that things need to be moving slowly to penetrate them, but then there are fight scenes where it appears as tho ppl are swinging full speed and penetrating just fine, particularly a couple of Duncan Idaho’s kills. I mostly just assumed that the best fighters in this universe are so good that they slow their blade down last second to the point it doesn’t look like they’re moving slow at all. Is that accurate? 
Another part I was a little confused at was when Paul and his mom are almost eaten by the worm. I understand the thumper was what distracted it, but when they ran in the first place Paul says something about drum sand? What is drum sand and why does it prevent sandwalking from working?

Yueh's death could be seen by a mile away though. That ""my wife is captured and I am doing this to release her but the captures 'released' her by killing her and me"" is almost a trope at this point.

Legolas is there to say Elven shit and knock heads with Gimli, which blossoms in the next 2 films. And Pip and Merry? A comedic duo. Those 2 have entire arcs in the next 2 films, but there is almost nothing interesting about them themselves. 

And then you actually read the book, and there is way, way, ***way*** more shit written for all of them in Fellowship than the characters in Dune.

The only people underdeveloped is Liet Kynes, Dr. Yueh, and Thufir Hawat, because they cut the exposition dump scenes and useless plotline, AKA the dinner, Jessica and Yueh's discussiion, and Thufir confronting Jessica over the dumb ""Who is the spy?"" plotline we already knew the answer to. The movie actually preserved the spy plot longer than the book - we didn't know it was Yueh until he shot Duke Leto in the movie, but Princess Irulan tells us they broke his Suk conditioning in the book.

Yah, that's the core of it.  In the books, all of these ""fragile things"" were internalized.  She was stoic, impossible to read, and was your first introduction into how incredibly badass the Bene Gesserit really were.   At first, you're impressed with the Atreides and the Harkonnen warriors.  Then you learn how deadly the Sardaukar were.   Then you're astonished with the Fremen, deadlier than all of them.   
THEN you understand that the Bene Gesserit.  the Women.   They were the deadliest of them all, but it was always hidden.  
But in the movie, they couldn't really do her internalizing (would have been clunky voice-overs), so they externalized it for us.  
And that's what I'm talking about.  Seriously, watch her shoulders, her collapsing into a tiny representation, stuff like that.  Fragile physicality.  
I understand why they did it, or at least I understood afterwards.  And it makes sense.  But it still surprised me at first, because in my mind - she and the other sisters were hands down the most dangerous creatures in the galaxy.

At this point, the non-book reading audience doesn't fully know the extent of the BG training. They've seen the voice, but not much else. 

Why not show her reliving the time she had to do this test herself, going through the range of emotions and settling on the controlled defiance, and have this mirrored in Paul more closely? It better communicates the training and that she passed it onto her son. If she had wailed during the test herself she would have been immediately killed.",qd6vqv

Jessica even does this in another scene when she's selecting the housekeeper. She's highly perceptive and recognizes the potential threat from the weapon, but remains calm to not escalate the situation. There are lots of instances like that in the book too.

hhl5cwn,"I don't really have compunctions with her *having* emotions.  But she's barely controlling them.  She is, rather, letting them get the better of her in situations in which she should be a larger presence.

The scene I thought that *did* do her justice was the interview of the housekeepers, in which she displayed concern and fear for her own safety (as evidenced by her hand signal dialogue with the guard), but kept her shit together and had a commanding presence in the room.

Most other scenes, she backed off and made faces, which I find offputting for a Bene Gesserit portrayal.",qd6vqv
hhlovil,"I feel like they went far too stoic with Gurney.  No songs, no music, just a few morose poems.  His training of paul was done in a more brusque manner than the book made it sound.  I was getting the impression that Gurney was treating Paul more in a ""You little shit"" manner than in a ""Oh you ragamufin you"" that I feel the book portrayed.  

If they really wanted to bring some levity to the movie, they probably could have included the Fenrings.  I always like their little bits in the book, taking life just about 70% seriously.",qd6vqv
hhlfo0x,"I agree but actually kept reminding myself a big part of the books was Paul using his training to pick up on his mother's emotions coming through and her training of control of her emotions wavering as she gets weaker with fear for him, his father, and ultimately grief. She can still fight but her emotions of fear, sadness, and grief become much less controlled as they endure more and his becomes better and it's a big role reversal for them. If they included a comment from him about it I think tht would've been portrayed better but they do never directly address it with each other, it's always a personal reflection",qd6vqv

hhrkb1y,"(Spoilers for the book btw)

>Throughout the movie, his mother walks Paul through what to do during life or death situations.

I don't think that you're wrong about that, but something is missed when her power is not demonstrated independent of these situations. The book's sub-plot of Hawat's suspicion of her helps do this. Hawat, who is super-super smart, clever, and insightful on his own right, fears her and believes her to be the only one capable of organizing a possible betrayal being motivated by the unknown goals of the Bene Gesserit. Both the Bene Gesserit and Jessica suffer from underdevelopment due to the cut of that subplot. Like, we don't even know that Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers share past maternal memories yet, and so the context for a male Bene Gesserit, the Changing of the Water, Alia's Abomination, and the connection to Paul's Prescience is missing.

I don't doubt that Denis will cover these things well in Dune 2, but as it stands Jessica and the Bene Gesserit are dangerously underdeveloped. They are at least as important as Paul is to the story. Paul has to lose in the end, which hinges on him failing to prevent the Jihad, which depends on his prescience being developed (maybe even the idea of the Golden Path...) and this depends on the Bene Gesserit being fully fleshed out.",qd6vqv
hhrvy71,"I think too that reminding Paul that his power came from Jessica being badass and not just from being the Duke's son, along with her birthing a son because she was confident he would be the messiah, communicated her power well. Also the sign language scenes showed emotional control and forethought. I felt like her vulnerability was more around the struggle between being bene gesserit and being a mother, wanting Paul to succeed and be safe and also experience suffering/failure to enter his full potential as the future messiah. She was used to show that tenuous balance between is Paul going to be good enough or not but I think it served as a good plot device to communicate that uncertainty in the film.",qd6vqv

I saw nothing advertised anywhere else, and had to search Reddit for a post about it because I didn’t see anything about it on my front page since that meme. Honestly I was getting worried it was delayed or something.

I’ve seen the original probably 20 times and was super excited for it to finally get here, but with how shit the last 18 months have been I just patiently waited and didn’t get my hopes up too much.

“Jason is an exuberant being, larger than life in everything he does. He loves the movie, which he has seen four times so far. And every time he calls me to tell me how happy he is. It is true that if Joe [Joe Walker, the editor] and I had let go, we could have done a version of several hours because I filmed a lot.

Remember when servants in the house would collect moist towels and  napkins left from the Guests and even sell them, that is how valuable water is. And they were totally against the palms and the 'secret garden' Jessica found.

There's a few Syfy/Stargate actors that I thought never really reached the stability I thought they deserved. Claudia Black is the one that really surprised me, I enjoyed her in Stargate & Farscape.

hhpvkz2,"That would be a tricky thing to incorporate because what makes it work is our access to Jessica's inner monologue and Chani's visible excitement and admiration of the kill. Without that context what you get is Jessica coming down hard on Paul (who has already been depicted as compassionate and reluctant to kill) for what seems like no reason.

Even in the book it seemed kind of unnecessary to me and I'm not sure what exactly it was intended to convey. Was it a bad read on Jessica's part? Based on his behavior and inner monologue, Paul didn't really seem to be relishing the kill at all, and there are a lot of times where Jessica's read on others isn't the greatest, even though that's a Bene Gesserit specialty. Or maybe even if Paul wasn't feeling very good in that moment, Jessica's remark was still good inoculation against him developing those sorts of feelings in the future. As a reader/viewer though, that seems dubious to me [**edit:** as in, it's not a parenting choice _I_ would make to try to help my kid avoid becoming a cold-blooded killer; rather than a cynical/passive-aggressive rebuke, I'd try a compassionate and mature conversation, but then what do I know.]

Running time is already 2.5 hours, options are stretch the runtime to be so long that people get turned off going to see it, bank on more sequels being made, or just condense backstories as best you can to make it fit in the movie universe.

But, I felt they may go further. I just read the Jamis chapter and stopped there. I felt this was the absolute farthest they'd go and they'd likely actually want to end on establishing contact with the fremen and leave it there. But, I felt if they did include up til that it may be rushed becuase in reality they really don't have enough time to hit the fremen at all with how much time they spend before/during/escaping the coup itself.

I am pretty pleased with how spot on I was and they pretty much adapted exactly what I imagined they would.

Def disappointed about the lack of Jessica almost being buried alive though. That was epic and showed their bond and training really well..but that was definitely a trade off for cramming contact with the fremen in at the last few minutes.",qd6vqv

And I think it works because even as a non-Fremen, you wouldn't necessarily expect someone in Paul's position to shed any tears over Jamis. The dude wanted nothing more but to kill Paul and his mother from the first moment they met until his death.

Granted, Paul wasn't so much mourning Jamis personally, as he was mourning his own loss of innocence. Either way it was a sincere and poignant moment, and the Fremen making a fuss over it seemed appropriate in terms of both world-building and storytelling.",qd6vqv

They talk about them a bit when they arrive but mainly from a distance such as when they are looking at the trees at the palace.  There is some discussion later in the book about them rebelling against the Harkonnens but that doesn't really add much depth to them either.

Really all that is given time in the book is the upper crust of society (the guild, the aristocrats, etc.) and the outsiders (the fremen, the smugglers, etc.).  The people more in the middle like the city folk are basically never talked about at all.",qd6vqv

hhtltqk,"Went to an afternoon showing in a Denver suburb today, IMAX, and theater was near 75-80% capacity, I was pretty surprised!",qd6vqv
hhlcggo,WB is in the process of being sold to Discovery. My guess is that the second part of Dune will be announced shortly after the sale is final.,qd6vqv
hhya383,I think Villenueve agrees with you! He’s said it will take several months to get production ramped up again but is hopeful he can complete filming in 2022 if they give the green light soon.,qd6vqv
hhpxzx5,Maybe I'm getting old but I found the audio to be just TOO loud at times. XD,qd6vqv
hhqbygh,I want to for sure. Hopefully I can make that happen.,qd6vqv
hhya8wo,I actually tried to see it in a theater today and the show got canceled due to flooding (thanks California weather!). I ended up watching at home and loved it; would definitely have preferred the theater experience though!,qd6vqv
hhnsrhg,They didn't.,qd6vqv
hhsor71,"Right, and that's what I'm referring to. The specific visual of having it fly all the way up to his eye while still not recognizing it was a target (while suddenly attacking at a silhouette that appeared without hesitation) just stretched suspension of disbelief too far. I get it was supposed to look cool, but it just felt silly.",qd6vqv
hhpprio,So if a projectile is slow enough it can bypass the shields? It seems like that is what the missiles did when impacting things on the ground like the parked ships. And they kind of imploded within the shield before the shield generator enough offline it seemed.,qd6vqv
hhtqouk,"right, i was thinking more like a computer interface between hunter seeker and the operator. Still has to have some kind of electronics. Or am i just nitpicking here?",qd6vqv
hihcb4w,But wasn't he dead when they found him?,qd6vqv
hhyf7sg,"Oh don't get me wrong, it was badass, and the lasguns were straight up scary. They never once mentioned the atomic backlash that I recall, so maybe they're just ignoring it. Hopefully people don't start questioning why not use lasguns for every engagement, though.",qd6vqv
hhxi4qs,Why did the Emperor take Arrakis away from the Harkonnens in the first place then? I kind of missed why during the movie,qd6vqv
hhw5g2h,"For the Atredies troops being better they also showed it pretty well during the attack as a bunch of Harkonen troops try and take the stairs from a thin line of Atredies but get pushed back down leaving a bunch of  bodies behind.

It's only when the Sardukar drop in behind them do the Atredies guys go down.",qd6vqv
hhxi70m,Why did the Emperor take Arrakis away from the Harkonnens in the first place then? I kind of missed why during the movie,qd6vqv
hhzo0tk,Cheers! That helps fill in a lot of gaps. Sounds like I need to read these books...,qd6vqv
hlg73tc,"Yeah, the bombs hit the shields and were probably timed to explode after letting gravity take them through the shields.",qd6vqv
hhmgvvm,"How? The scene in this movie is almost an exact copy of the original one, just without the mental narration.",qd6vqv
hhpv6cw,"This is wrong. It's not random. It's always huge, like a nuclear explosion. They use it in the books to break through the shield wall, which is actually a mountain range, not a really big wall.",qd6vqv
hhmkbab,"Yeah I was wondering if that would happen, but oh well.",qd6vqv
hifh49m,"Wait so why were the bad guys using a laser to try to shoot down Duncan? They were blasting all over the city, had pretty good odds of hitting a shield somewhere, no?",qd6vqv
hhl2b1n,Right that makes sense!,qd6vqv
hhn9xl3,"I read somewhere that this is also why the Fremen are such great warriors vs the Sardaukar and other troops of the Imperium, because shields are useless in the deep desert where they live they never learned to slow down their blades right before the blow and they can keep the momentum all the way through. Combined with harsh culture they have that centers around the strong surviving and being great warriors they become an elite fighting force that can beat the Sardaukar and threaten the Imperium because the Sardaukar are the key to the power of Emperor",qd6vqv
hhoujqb,"The problem is, you can't make the swords cool.  

Lasers interact with shields in explosive ways.  Like, nuclear explosive ways, but with the explosion occurring on both ends of the interaction.  I.E. Hitting a shield with a laser is a death sentence for both the shield wearer and for you, and likely for everyone near you.",qd6vqv
hhlhdmo,They still showed it was yueh who planted the thropter as his diamond shape was carved into the seats and the bags with the ring it showed him taking so there was that,qd6vqv
hhxuiv1,"The book is definitely more of a political, internal turmoil crawl. I think it was to the films strength to cut a lot of that, as narration rarely translates well to movies. The director did a great job of emphasizing all the elements that work well on screen.",qd6vqv
hhq05a2,"Damn I never thought about it but you’re right, truly some of the most stunning and believed senses of scale in those movies. Idk why but his giant ships n stuff just feel particularly real compared with other movies",qd6vqv
hhy9k7b,I need this man's take on The Culture when he's finished with Dune. Only he and Alex Garland could do it justice IMO.,qd6vqv
hhvjpv8,That last shot of the worm near the ending was epic when it just stares at Paul for a bit on the edge of the sand,qd6vqv
hic9c1b,"I really liked the constant scenes of people and things just getting bogged down in the sand when Worms were around.

I recently had the pleasure of rewatching *Jurassic Park* in a theater, and it had similar stuff: show what the big thing is *doing* to the normal-sized world.",qd6vqv
hhkza0q,"In all fairness, the main characters of Dune might as well be comparable royalty (although I haven’t read the book, just the vibe I got), so I wasn’t that bothered by their lack of interaction with a more lived in world. We only see the palace (?) of Arakeen, and I don’t think there would be any real storytelling benefit by showing other parts of the city.",qd6vqv
hhq08ft,"I didn’t really feel that with blade runner, and it felt kind of appropriate in dune, see what you mean I think",qd6vqv
hhklit1,"You articulated my thoughts.  They did a lot of showing, not telling, and it was awe inspiring.",qd6vqv
hhkmecv,"Love that they didn’t explain what the “ voice “ was. Just used and let you understand it through the effect it had.

Edit: Shield as well.",qd6vqv
hhkwwuq,"> It definitely wasn't afraid to throw details that pertain to the world at us without having to explain them

It felt refreshing.

For the first time, well ever… I am actually thinking about setting up a home theatre and finally getting 4k. 

I just want to watch it again to see what details I missed.",qd6vqv
hhl5qeq,"THIS. Just got back from the theater and was having difficulty articulating this. The first third of the film did an amazing job at showing rather than telling. Is was incredibly refreshing, and coupled with the cinematography I was more engaged than I am with most recent sci-fi movies. 

My only gripe were a few scenes that existed purely to move the protagonists between locations. I’m guessing because of runtime they were edited down to the point where they had a deus ex machina feel to them, which a couple lines of explanation could have resolved. Like how did Aquaman know where to find the protagonist in the desert after their crash? I think the scene edits did a disservice. 

I’ve never read the books but now want to!",qd6vqv
hhml12i,When >!Gurney was flipping through an orange catholic bible on their descent !< I was fucking giddy.,qd6vqv
hhl14ws,"Like when Paul says, ""You good?""",qd6vqv
hhmkr0v,"That’s exactly how the book treats those same things, which is incredible to see in a movie. My biggest concern was that the audience who didn’t read the book wouldn’t understand the lore",qd6vqv
hhrtx4b,I am so tired of movies shoving details in the viewer's face and then over-explaining them. I read the book and I was still a little lost at certain details and I loved it. I want my brain working while I'm watching something so immersive. I found myself wondering about certain details after the movie ended because I was so caught up I missed things. I never want to watch movies a second time (I also hate long movies) and I found myself wanting to watch Dune again immediately. The showing vs. telling in this film is amazing and I appreciate Villenueve for trusting the audience to use a little inferencing and to put some of the pieces together on their own.,qd6vqv
hhufsay,The movie took itself seriously and also respected the audience's intelligence. No need to explain everything... audience is smart enough to connect the dots or use their fantasy to fill in some blank spaces.,qd6vqv
hhkr4dd,"That’s how the book is too, which also impressed me that they did that in the movie. Reinforced how the movie was so true to the book imo",qd6vqv
hhyyiue,The Sardaukar getting their blood blessing was a very disturbing scene that couldn’t have been done better.,qd6vqv
hi5jifb,"> throw details that pertain to the world at us without having to explain them

It actually reminded me of the original Star Wars in that way.  It all felt dirty, lived in and it wasn't going to explain any of the weird shit that's going on around the edges.",qd6vqv
hhzz2j8,I love a movie that can pull that off so well. Felt like there wasn’t a single moment wasted over explaining things.,qd6vqv
hi29dfx,It made me want to finish the book! I have started the series a few times and would get distracted. There were several things I saw that made me wish I knew the rich back history.,qd6vqv
hhkz6bq,"Yeah, there are lots of information that can't be given without clunky expositional dialog so I guess they omitted them.

Basically a long time ago there was an A.I uprising so they banned computers and all their techs are analog now.

The shields allow slow moving objects to pass through and block fast moving objects so projectile guns are useless. Energy gun exists but when the energy beam hits a shield it causes a explosion/recoil that kills the shooter also.

I believe in the sword training shield Gurney explicitly said ""the slow blade penetrates the shield"". They also show Paul tested his shield by first chopping at his hand at a high speed, and then touching the blade at a slow speed.",qd6vqv
hhkzdjj,"Idk if you’ve read the books or not but the tech is explained by two things:

1. Humanity was almost ended by an AI uprising thousands of years ago so “thinking machines” are banned. That’s why the people with the lip tattoos exist. They’re called mentats and are essentially human computers.

2. Shield tech is extremely good to the point guns are useless. Blades are the best way to kill people because you have to go slow up close to get through a shield.

Also the lasers they use toward the end are a huuuge war crime and are almost never used because they react with shields to create basically a nuclear explosion.",qd6vqv
hhmjzm3,"The shields are supposed to justify the swords because normal firearms don't work on shields. They do use slow-moving projectile weapons, you can see Duncan get hit by one and it burrows into his shield. Really Herbert just thought swords were cooler, and I think the movie is going for ""who cares about the explanation, it looks badass and that's enough""",qd6vqv
hhlf0wq,That's part of the appeal of Dune. It's really a sci-fi / fantasy hybrid. It is built around the idea that it would be cool as hell if 18th century cultures had spaceships *and* magic.,qd6vqv
hhtvdp8,"Shields render fast moving projectile weapons completely ineffective, so swords become favored when you can’t shoot the enemy.",qd6vqv
hhuwcud,"I think the pre-waters visions would be fine to do in film, they're jumbled and contradictory. It isn't until later when Paul gets control of his prescience that we see a glimpse of the Golden Path.",qd6vqv
hhnsl8f,"To be fair, that scene was almost identical to the original movie's scene with the box.  I don't think it required much interpretation on the part of the director(s).",qd6vqv
hhl38n7,"That actually felt really off. That’s not where he’s at in the book, it’s also contrary to the rest of the way he built Paul in the beginning.",qd6vqv
hhkzow8,"Yeah, that's what I remember. They seem to be setting it up for something in Dune 2, but I don't remember them going into detail on grandpa's story until they get that ancestral knowledge thing much later on.",qd6vqv
hhqfyaz,"I think for non-book readers the cliff scene was a great addition. A lot of Duke Leto’s characterization in the book comes from internal monologue. 

That scene shows us how much he truly loves and cares for his son rather than just being some cold distant ruler.",qd6vqv
hhl3b3m,"It actually bugs me, he’s not had Paul say the litany. He’s handed it off to Jessica in every instance.",qd6vqv
hhkp6kx,“Fear is the mind killer…only I will remain”,qd6vqv
hhl8n4c,"I agree with you, but I will say it's a little ironic that they'd scrub overt references to Islam (and just leave the visual coding) when Dune is a straightforward allegorical critique of colonial power grabs for middle eastern oil, lol.",qd6vqv
hhn606y,"I agree, but am still disappointed. The word has a lot of nuance and force, especially when it gains 10,000 years of history. 

Paul's Jihad carries him more than him carrying it. It's an inevitability taken on by his adopted culture, a fallen western man fueled by the vigor of the east. Much more terrifying to use the local word.",qd6vqv
hhljn87,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhlddnp,Oh shoot I was hoping to see it in a regular theater because I couldn’t understand certain parts in IMAX,qd6vqv
hhlxh7i,Yeah I wish the IMAX had subtitles,qd6vqv
hja4rt1,"Same here, couldn’t understand even half of what he was saying during that sequence.",qd6vqv
hhn4ate,It's blue in the books.,qd6vqv
hhlv2mc,"How it should've gone:  
  
Paul's visions more strongly emphasize the galactic jihad, and multiple times we hear the word ""Muad'dib"" clearly being said or  chanted amidst scenes of violence and bloodlust.  Paul has no idea what the word means, and even asks Duncan what it is, but he doesn't know.  The audience doesn't know either.  Like in the book, Paul analyzes all the possible avenues for his and Jessica's survival, like seeking a place with the Guild or becoming smugglers.  Paul  wants to avoid whatever path leads to his visions of war.  
  
The movie ends when Paul chooses his tribal name amongst the Fremen, asking to be known as whatever they call the little desert mouse.  Stilgar pauses, then:  ""Muad'dib""",qd6vqv
hhl6lxj,"He takes on the name Muad’Dib which means mouse. I recommend reading the book. The movie did a great job adapting the first half, and the second half is amazing.",qd6vqv
hhlearv,You actually got what should be gathered. The mouse is a mystery and example of resilence and Paul's attention to it is something special and unique that exhibits he has a better understanding  of the planet and connection to the planet than would be expected,qd6vqv
hhljqbv,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhkxhdq,Yup. Pretty much immediately.,qd6vqv
hhl3f38,It’s his name.,qd6vqv
hhlnqke,"Ah okay, it's been a little while since a read that part. Thank you. I guess I took his tent scene in the books as more detached, tripping, and upset rather than yelling at his mom. Maybe it was the voice that made it seem so intense? I don't think he used the voice to tell her to GTFO even if he did say the freak bit ?",qd6vqv
hhmohsg,">Eugenics being a thing that happens in this fictional universe is fine.

but it's *icky*!",qd6vqv
hhmpmc2,"Yep!

Which for me - in the overall scope of things I think I'm ok with, if they hadnt cut the BG corners of grooming.

Loved the film immensely - that was just the 'would really like to have' category.",qd6vqv
hhm6q7o,"Right, but in Children, Leto II describes being in a spice trance after being force fed spice and saying he remembers memories from as far back as being a single cell organism. 

I assumed that all humans memories are tied to the genetic memory because we had a common ancestor, but yeah I'm not sure.",qd6vqv
hho1y2w,"People wanted GoT in space, which I understand, but to me palace intrigue is the least interesting aspect of Dune. The hero is a DMT'd tyrant/God who's the product of eugenics, and who commits genocide with the tacit endorsement of his own mother, who was fine with him being sacrificed in a religious ritual had he been deemed too weak to carry out said genocide. 

The characters in Dune are inherently alienating, and this film captures that fairly well. Like 2001, a sort of foreign detachment permeates everything. People can either interpret that as empty and boring, or if they're attuned to that sort of filmmaking, creepy and alien. Dune to me is a deeply unsettling film, and that's more interesting than a Star Wars/GoT hybrid.",qd6vqv
hhr60ot,"> Your first point is actually another hit against the movie. In the book Jessica is a prime suspect for the betrayal before it happens, and a pretty important conversation between her and Thufir sets the stage for that. But they just cut it out of the movie.

weird that i still thought that, then, if it wasn't in the movie at all. what a bad movie /s",qd6vqv
hhl0yj7,"Ah, my bad.  I though it was when he did his Water of Life trip.  My mistake.",qd6vqv
hhp3jb1,"My enjoyment comes from analyzing them. Your issues can be someone else's non issues. If you can't handle anothers analysis of a film, maybe you should stay away from critical discussion of them.",qd6vqv
hil0auc,"It was to show that the Sardaukar went the other way in the tunnels, thus getting to Kynes",qd6vqv
hhom4zs,The slow blade penetrates the shield.,qd6vqv
hhzg1n1,"He's awake and about to sneak out of his room to explore the new quarters at night with no one around. He stops when he sees the hunter-seeker. It ends the same way, with Mapes coming in and the seeker trying to kill her instead.",qd6vqv
hhr074g,*Discombobulate*,qd6vqv
hhvd5u5,"Oh, I guess I didn’t notice him finishing Jamis in the way he saw himself go down.  Thanks for pointing that out.",qd6vqv
hi2u4k2,"Then make more of them, or do a TV series. New viewers have no idea what they've even missed out on, but the story was dumbed down considerably just so it fit the arbitrary ""movie time limit"". It's 2021... I'd have thought we'd be past such arbitrary limitations by now.",qd6vqv
hiu2yod,I'm assuming they'll want to adapt the sequels too.,qd6vqv
hkflyy0,Star Wars was the same actually The Emperor only became the main character in the 3rd movie.,qd6vqv
hhv5eq9,You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill.,qd6vqv
hhv5nvn,"Yeah it seemed a little on-the-nose to me. On the other hand, being a fan of Apocalypse Now, it immediately evoked the thought that his character was full of incomprehensible malice and capable of anything in the service of a grandiose plan only he understood. He's sick of this mortal world, he's tired, he hates everyone around him, but he still has so much important work to do.",qd6vqv
hhtreg8,I think it's gonne do great in the box office. This movie seems like it'll be the movie that brings people back to theatres.,qd6vqv
hhrc2dz,Let's also not forget our lord and savior Roger Deakins who has worked with Villeneuve for most of his career. Shame he was too booked for Dune.,qd6vqv
hkdk8ug,[deleted],qd6vqv
hhlhv7r,AR RI VAL!,qd6vqv
hhl7cqm,Lol so zero credit to the actual cinematographer that worked on this movie,qd6vqv
hhl43yw,"Sure, he had done so in Arrival already, for instance.

By the way, it's DENIS, a french name pronounced dəni.",qd6vqv
hhpa1je,"Nope solo was Bradford young who shot arrival.

Dune was shot by greig Fraser who lensed rouge one and the pilot (&and other) episodes of mandolorian. (Basically he created the look for that show )

Also while the raw footage would have a good amount of light in it, nd filters would have used to ensure it wasn’t “blasted by light” because that would be unrecoverable. (Since it was day for night they would want to be underexposed by at least two stops or more then grade the color to appear to be moonlit)

Also I found the darkness in this film to look better then solo since the color on that movie got muddy due to the LED lights being worse then those used on dune.


Edit: you removed mistake about it being the same person as solo then downvoted me and played it off as jsut “punctuation”? Lol",qd6vqv
hhwf2w1,And typically you never see lenses stopped all the way down. Anything like a t16 or t22 will have a decrease in sharpness. While around t8 or t11 lenses will have maximum sharpness whilie also having full depth of field or just about the widest depth of field the lens can yield. With ND filters on hand there is really no reason to ever stop a cinema lens all the way down.,qd6vqv

hkoy7ok,"Part of the ship, part of the crew",qd6vqv
hhumu4a,"The hero going from refusing his path to accepting it is not a satisfactory arc for me, he still needs to do accomplish something. This movie feels like if Star Wars had ended right after Luke leaves Tatooine with Obi Wan. 

But I actually think the Fellowship is a decent comparison, and I was trying to figure out last night why the Fellowship worked for me and this didn't. I think a big difference is expectations, with Dune, I didn't even know that it was only part 1 until that thing flashed up at the beginning so I didn't know to expect that the story wouldn't be resolved until I was about 90 minutes into the movie and nothing had happened. I really think they should've called this ""Dune part 1"" in all ads and promos because I didn't even know until after the fact that this was only half of the first book.

Even so, I still think it would've suffered from the boring problem but I would've at least known what to expect",qd6vqv

hht90br,So much of 40K is drawn directly from Dune. Not that that’s a bad thing but yeah,qd6vqv

hhl8016,They actually do it constantly. His eyes go white quite a bit. And if you pay attention Piters do it off cycle. Even if he doesn’t say something you can see them calculate something.,qd6vqv
hhl2teo,"Piter was unfortunately a horribly underutilized character in this one, they really wasted Dastmalchian's acting talent by giving him like 5 lines.  Villenueve has said the he wants to dive a lot deeper into Mentats in Part 2, so I expect we'll get a lot more of an explanation.",qd6vqv

Baron = Tywin, both filthy rich and ruthless assholes. 
Arya = Saint Alia of The Knife. Literally both young. female killer assassins and daughters of a patriarch who dies in the first act. 

Ridiculously wealthy house wipes out a relatively poorer but more likeable/popular rival house excepting a male heir. The concept of houses represented by animal sigils in general, with a monarch ruling over all of them.

The Emperor was really afraid for his legacy. He had only daughters, unbeknownst to him that was due to the Bene Gesserit. He was in a position where he didn’t have an heir the other houses would have forces something to ensure stability. The two largest Nobel families were the Atradies and the Harkonen. A Harkonen married to one of his daughters was out of the question. An atradies would have taken over. He knocks them out using the Harkonen, they would have failed on arrkais allowing him to send in his troops openly, and him granting a marriage to a much weaker house where his daughter would have actually been in control.",qd6vqv
hiu2hx7,I think they're taking about Paul crying over Jamis' dead body being excluded. The Fremen we're amazed that he'd give up his own water (i.e. cry) over one of their own. They could still do that at the funeral because it does seem like a weird thing for Dune fan to intentionally exclude. It couldn't add more than a couple of minutes of runtime if done right,qd6vqv

hhle05k,"Nah.  He’s not the KH…yet.  It’ll be in the second movie unfortunately.  The spice everywhere is causing some future seeing abilities, but nothing is really clear to Paul.  The real reason it seemed like he was fucking around with jamis was because he had 1) never killed someone, 2) didn’t really want to kill Jamis, 3) always fought with those shields, so his strikes weren’t killing blows. It’s described pretty well in the book.",qd6vqv
hhlg5ma,"That's actually how it was in the book for him, you picked up perfectly on his emotional state.

In the book he only noticed that the guy switched hands cause chani warns him. Which was a weird thing to cut.

But he 100% was scared shit and overwhelmed af by the visions and the spice and spent the night watching tons of visions of him getting stabbed and dying in that fight to the point it was like 99.9% probable so he was totally freaked",qd6vqv
hhm0ffy,"In the book they emphasize a bit that it’s largely the special Bene Gesserit training that his mom has layered on top of his already lifetime of training that has him completely outmatching Jamis even though Paul is totally distracted.

hhr4kr3,"When I've seen movie theater employees talk about it, they say they set it up so you can hear the quietest dialog.

The problem is, IMAX speakers are ridiculously high powered, and movies keep putting insane amount of range in the mixing, all the way from barely audible whispers to insane sound swells and explosions.

I think Hollywood has to agree on some basic guidelines on the quietest speaking/whisper decibel before you put subtitles in and the loudest decibel before you are probably hurting people.

No one in the chain takes responsibility, everyone blames someone else, and directors are too far up their own ass to ever take responsibility for their demands with their sound team.",qd6vqv

The Bene Gesserit have developed acute control over their bodies and minds, down to the cellular level. Bene Gesserit can even choose to have male or female children and use the spice to become human lie detectors. Space Guild Navigators use the spice to see into the future, making space travel possible.

hhw73nc,"My wife, who hasn't read the book, also enjoyed it, though she did feel like it was more aimed at book readers.

It kind of felt more like a montage of scenes than a coherent story, to me. It felt both fast paced and slow paced, somehow.

I'm fine with movies leaving a lot out, that's inevitable, but I felt like they didn't build up to the betrayal of Yueh and the Emporer that maximized payoff.

A lot of seemingly important worldbuilding type things were left out that would have been easy to include. Like I'm pretty sure they didn't even explain that the blue eyes are connected to spice? And the description of spice was basically one line. They didn't explain the mentats, or even really the Bene Geserits, and how spice is connected to them.

I think some people will finish this movie thinking spice is a fuel source, because there's only one line where they mention the navigators.

It felt to me like the movie was a little afraid of being heavy handed with exposition but went too far in the other direction with stuff being too subtle or just not really explained at all.

Another example is that Duncan Idaho is obviously an incredible warrior. The only way that's shown prior to his death scene is how he mentions that the Freman fight like demons, with the unsaid implication being that he still handled them. Then later as he approaches the ornithopter to steal it, the enemies are so afraid of him they run away. But it's blink and you miss it.

Now as a book reader that's enough for me, I get it, so his death scene is still epic as hell. But I feel like they should have shown that and made it more clear so that his death was even more impactful.

Jessica's characterization felt very off, too. She's way too fidgeting and dare I say whiny? Halfway through the movie my wife even said ""Jessica is really wearing on me,"" which as a book reader killed me.

So yeah not a bad movie by any means, and beautiful, but not intrigue and suspense filled story I thought it would be.",qd6vqv

hhom4cw,"That actually seems awkward that a house that goes back 10,000 years (according to them) would be so quick to adapt new imagery.",qd6vqv
hi0lgoy,"Its less about just how the armor works and more about how the world is built. If a laser (lasgun) hits a shield it can create an atomic explosion (basically mutually assured destruction) this is why everyone uses swords and knives. Also, the reason mentats (basically human thinking machines) are important is because 10,000 years prior to the events in Dune humans had created machines that fought back and created a massive war between humans and machines. When humans prevailed, the emperor banned any thinking machine, which hindered space travel. Specially trained beings called mentats are capable of quick highly intelligent plans and calculations and are basically used instead of machine computers. Without machine computers no one is capable of interstellar travel, except for Guild navigators (briefly mentioned in the herald scene early in the movie) who use a massive amount of spice to plot the navigation. If they had machine computers, there would only be medicinal/ceremonial/recreational use of spice and demand would plummet. 

Dr. Yueh is a suk doctor, that means he has imperial conditioning which should make it impossible to betray the Duke. He also loathes the Harkonnens. This is supposed to make the betrayal even more shocking and hard to believe. In the book for most characters its unknown if Thufir or Jessica betrayed them. Aside from incapacitating the Duke he also ruins the comms and shield wall. The attack could have been repelled if Yueh hadn't betrayed the Duke. 

Its supposed to be a secret that the emperor has aided the Harkonnens. The plan as far as the Duke knows was to pit Harkonnens and Atreides against each other. Once sarduakar are discovered they know the emperor has chosen a side. If the other great and minor houses find out of the emperor's role it would cause a revolt. 

I know all of this isn't necessary to tell a complete story, but the fact they can't use machine computers and therefore creates this need for spice melange is one of my favorite aspects of the story, its just so unique. I'm glad you liked the movie, so did I.",qd6vqv

hhmmuh0,"Also that was part of what made the book incredible. The way Herbert handle internal dialogue was part of what makes the book so legendary. The way he used mutually observed external objects to create perspective switches was something I’ve never read before or since. One moment you’re in a characters head experiencing the moment as they do. Suddenly through an observation they make, suddenly you’re in another characters head making a similar observation. My words don’t do it justice, because of how damn smooth Frank Herbert was with it. You would be reading as one character and suddenly you’re another character, and you would have to go back and reread where the switch happened because there was no way to predict the switch in advance.

But I can see how the film would struggle with something like that.",qd6vqv
hin9y4g,"Timothee Chimothee only had one speed the entire movie: pouty. So much of the dialogue in D1984 is strikes multiple different tones, which gives the characters more depth. The delivery and tone of this one just felt like a funeral the whole time. Add a really maudlin soundtrack that doesn’t ever seem to stop or change in intensity or tone, and it just ends up being a really monotone movie. I kept thinking, “why is every one /so sad/“. 

Add in multiple extended scenes of people walking regally across open landscapes, and it really just felt like a really dark Marvel movie. Had I not gone in with some background in Dune lore (which is kind of silly!), I would have left with a really wrong impression of what was going on. It’s hard to tell that the Atreideis are the good guys and really feel bad when they get slaughtered, because they’re all so serious all the time and don’t seem to have any other redemptive characteristics. They never have any fun! What a weird movie",qd6vqv

They also telegraphed a bit too much of what would happen later on which, again, removed the stakes of the scene because you know what’s going to happen.

If it focused more on complex political intrigue rather than simply emphasise IMPORTANCE of Paul constantly, it would be easier to feel engaged without needing to develop him beyond broad strokes.

Rising action: Spice Harvester scene

Climax: The Harkonnen attack on Arrakeen.

It looked like a dark, adult star wars and I can dig that. 

The actually movie reminded me of a star wars, Warhammer 40k and game of thrones Mash up, but it fell pretty flat for me. 

I was trying to keep up with ""house archaidis"" and ""house zardakk"" and ""Lisen al-shakalalala"" but (and this might just be the theater I was in), I could only hear half the dialogue.

My take away was that the world seems fucking awesome, but the execution wasn't great and it feels like they cut out huge chunks ofthe movie which would have given more context and allowed me to care about the characters. 

Idk, this should have been a movie that I loved: dark, horror-themed sci Fi with a big, grand world to explore but it just felt flat.",qd6vqv

hhm8t5e,"Not disagreeing with you on the impact GoT had, and it was certainly an outlier back when it aired and more or less paved the way for networks to start putting up big money to produce higher quality shows. But nowadays GoT isn't that much of an anomaly in terms of shows with a high budget per episode. And although it might not attract as large of an audience that GoT ended up having, I'm sure a sci-fi action drama epic on HBO would still attract a pretty sizable audience, especially if you look at the viewership Westworld achieved in its first season (it was actually the most watched first season of any HBO show, including GoT). To be fair, GoT viewers went up each season whereas Westworld lost viewers each season, but I'd be inclined to think that has less to do with the genre and subject matter, and more to do with Westworld as a series not having the kind of consistency of quality in those three seasons compared to GoT (quality of the latter seasons notwithstanding). Westworld was the type of show that would have worked better as a one off kind of thing, like a one season miniseries, whereas GoT was made to have a longer-running format (and HBO was more than willing to shell out the money for more seasons but D&D wanted to end it). I feel like HBO could have easily marketed a Dune tv show as ""sci-fi GoT"" and it would have gathered plenty of viewers.

His family is uprooted to a new world with new opportunities, but they are instead deceived by the Emperor and most everyone he knows is killed. He and his mother escape and hide out among the Fremen, and he has to prove their worth to stay. He does so via his first time taking someone's life, and becomes accepted by the Fremen.

Man vs Animal, Paul recalling the Litany against Fear before the test begins vs Jessica reciting it outside the door during, Paul’s experience while his hand is in the box and his reluctance to remove it when the test is over, Dr Yueh’s presence, etc. 

The part that most bothers me is when the test is over there’s a discussion between the Reverend Mother and Paul about the test where she finds that Paul senses truth. This leads her to believe that he could be the Kwisatz Haderach, though she tempers her excitement. Introducing the Kwisatz Haderach to us and Paul at the same time leaves us both with the same questions. What is it, what does it mean? Now we’re on the path with him to discover it. “Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what that terrible purpose was.” Paul then questions why the Bene Gesserit test for humans and in that answer we learn of the Butlerian Jihad, which is the reason that the Spacing Guild and the Bene Gesserit exist and to what purposes. We see more of Paul’s skills, or evidence of his mother’s teachings, in his perception of how things work with little explanation from the Reverend Mother. We then learn of the truthsayer drug, aka the water of life, what it does, what it means to take it, and that no man has ever successfully taken it. All of this foreshadows Paul’s journey to becoming what he will be. 

Instead of that, we hear about birthrights (why?), the Reverend Mother asks about his dreams (this happens on another day in the book and with far more detail), leaves the room after calling Paul a human, then admonishes Jessica for having a son (only a private thought in the book) and teaching him in the way, wasted potential in a male, etc and it’s there we hear about the Kwisatz Haderach - Paul doesn’t. This doesn’t happen in the book. Jessica is in fact encouraged to continue teaching Paul in the way, and she tells Jessica that for his safety, he should be taught the voice. In the movie, she’s already teaching him the voice before the Reverend Mother arrives. In the book, again, the Reverend Mother is hopeful, even excited about Paul’s potential, not angry with Jessica. 

I could go on, but this is already too long. 

Overall, there’s a lot of depth and detail in the story that’s been left out, some of it I understand, because Herbert’s writing is so dense, but I feel like there are some foundational elements left out. It leaves me feeling like I don’t care what happens to any of these characters. We neither know them nor their motivations.

The line ""he's a jealous man, a dangerous jealous man"" could have been spoken on Arrakis. The Reverend Mother could have met the Baron on site before or during the dinner table scene.

> That's one characteristic of Denis Villeneuve, he doesn't connect the dots himself, he uses one thing to indirectly explain something else

I'll have to watch the movie again when it starts streaming, but my current impressions is that this movie does not work that way at all. It does for the lack of guns. But for many other plot points the dots are connected for you, thoroughly.

How do the Fremen survive? You're told in advance

How to walk through the sand? You've seen the educational video

However, as the planetary natives they have obviously been in the desert for an incredibly long time, the dawn of their species really unless their planet had extreme climate changes, but aka before they had sweat recycling tech, so where did they get water before then? They had to have gotten it from somewhere. You would assume plants but in the movie someone states that the plants exist because of the Fremen...so did the Fremen just magically evolve to need water on a planet that doesn't have any?

It was done much better in the books, definitely. They didn't really show the vision part that well at all, apart from the 239842348034234 Chani scenes. 

> How are we saying that’s not conflict when his entire people were murdered ?

That's too simple/cliche for today's standard, though I will say that back then, the ideas of this book were revolutionary, and I get that. But nowadays, which hero *doesn't* lose their parent(s)/entire family lol? That's the baseline of their journey literally almost always. What comes after that is more important. I'd say his visions and conflict of going thru the golden path (which were not even glanced at in this movie, apart from him sweating in a tent, making it kinda meh) are better examples, because his choice is intertwined with the conflict.

> I don’t see how Duncan was over hyped when he killed Sadukar left and right in that hallway. I think in the lore he kills 17

The hype-killing moment for me was (and this is again just the movie), where the mentat tells the Sardaukar general that ""these men have been trained by Duncan and Gurney"" and then right after they get absolutely fucked up. There's no point then, of the hype, plotwise. It's like that anime trope where some character A demonstrates how powerful they are right in time to get dunked on by another character B, to show how powerful B is. 

There was no ""cleverness"" at all at any point in the movie, apart from maybe Paul's ""let Jesus take the wheel"" in the storm. Always straight and simple violence. Point A > Point B > Point C. I know a lot more happens in the books, but this movie dumped everything into visuals, and so lacked points for other areas.",qd6vqv
hilqvuy,"To me, this definitely seems like one of those movies like LotR or Harry Potter that's better to watch if you're watching it all together in one big go; not as individual installments. My girlfriend and I and a couple of our friends who hadn't read the books were really kinda confused as to why we should've cared about anything that happened (especially since it doesn't end on a cliffhanger, it just kinda ends awkwardly?). We watched it as a group of 10 and the 7 of us who were unfamiliar asked the remaining 3 about what any of that was and it turns out there's a lot of stuff that just isn't explained in the movie I guess? If there's a Part 3, I think I'll just watch this one again and Part 2 when that one comes out.


If you don't mind my asking, why do you feel it's bizarre that people unfamiliar with the books would be lost? I got the sense that I should've done some reading or something after having come out of that movie if I wanted to know what those black lipped guys were (I guess this world doesn't have computers or something and their eyes roll back when they do calculations?) or why Atreides is so scary for the emperor (I guess they have a closer claim to the throne for some reason? But they're also portrayed as incredibly loyal so I don't get the sense that they'd wanna stage a coup, so there's literally no danger) or why the Harkonens have such a hard on for killing the Atriedes (I thought it was because they wanted their goldmine back, but I guess there's also some bad blood and a former war between them or something). 


This movie is definitely not for people who haven't read the books. Even two of the 3 who had read the books were dissatisfied; only the one guy was really amped up coming out of the movie in our group of 10. 


My girlfriend and I are particularly curious as to how we should feel about Paul cause he's the protagonist, but he literally didn't do anything except kill the guy at the end (and despite his mom saying he's never taken a life before, he seemingly feels nothing about it afterwards, so is that a lie or does he just not care?). Otherwise, everyone just kinda does everything for him which makes sense since he's a prince I guess.


That's the thing, I keep having to say, ""I guess"" when talking about this movie because it feels as though I was supposed to know more about it going in as opposed to being able to experience it like the blank slate that I was. This movie just doesn't feel like it was made to bring people in; it was made by the fans for the fans. And that's fine, but it just feels really weird to have watched such a long movie and come out of it feeling as though I just watched the prologue of LotR but extended to 2.5 hours where all of that could've just been shortened or it could've just started where the movie ends and had prior events told through flashbacks.


Edit: like...this movie honestly kinda bugs me the more I think about it. And not in a good way; more like, ""was I supposed to know about this or that before I watched??"" or, ""why wasn't that explained/emphasized more if that was supposed to be important?"" or ""literally why were there so many visions of Zendaya if she literally only gives him a dagger??""",qd6vqv

How do you know? the story hasn't finished yet. This is half the story. Trust me those points will become more relevant as the story progresses, you will see more of the Baron, you will finally see the Emperor. This is the equivalent of only seeing Fellowship of the Ring, where you have a generic impression of Aragorn and the threat of the Dark Riders aren't even properly realised. It's only in second and third film when you find out Witch King exists (even though they showed him but didn't explain him in the first movie), it's only in the third movie where you see Aragorn develop as a character... heck you even see Pippin develop, turning from some clumsy, childish Hobbit to a Hobbit with a bit more wisdom. 

> The depth comes from the heart of the story being about humanity

Oh, Dune certainly has something to say about humanity, but it's not necessarily a positive thing. So if you're looking for love hearts and rainbows maybe this isn't your thing. It's more of a criticism and a warning of things that affect humanity. But for those lessons to be learnt the story has to come to an end.


> I feel like it had a chance with the Fremen to hold the answer to the story, but there was nothing there, either, and they just turn out to be servile, inhuman, grey zealots in their own way.

The whole of the second half of the story takes place in Fremen sietch's so they will be expanded upon more in the second film.

Or, if you've got 2 shows of 24 weeks, you'll still end up with at least 4 weeks... of *an hour long slot.*  

Worse, those 4-12 weeks might be in two chunks, with two 2-6 week slots about 6 weeks apart.

Very faithful to the books, not as grotesque as the 80s movie, and it had a lot of well known and up and coming actors and actresses so the acting was generally very good. 

I’d say it is a better series, and it also expanded to include the other books (Children of Dune). Pacing was better because they didn’t spend lots of time in slow establishing shots of their sets and CGI.

The story was relatively easy enough to follow. Something about the chosen one white boy, and a betrayal between kingdoms that are supposed to be on the same side, and something about whiteboy trying to learn how to use his powers to save everyone.

Dune is better as a piece of audiovisual art than any series, including something like Game of Thrones.

GoT can do it once an episode, *maybe*.

Visuals allow you to convey meaning much more quickly. But people are too used to series now and just expect everything to be an endless slog of he says this, I say that.

Flipping a coin again though, nobody in the world of Dune ever comments on the barons activities as being awful and degenerate. The emperor doesn't stop slavery, the atreides don't even stamp out slavery and sex slavery on Arrakis. The Baron doesn't hide his homosexual activities.

So the emperor wanted to put them on a position that pit them against their ancient rivals, the Harkonens. Because the Baron’s house has more money and manpower, but is disliked by the other houses, and if they were to take the throne, it’d have to be by force.


This way, the emperor can eliminate one rival, and put another rival somewhat into his pocket by helping him with killing the Atreides.


Duke Leto saw that this was the plan, but also figured(correctly) that both other parties were underestimating the Fremen. So he thought  that if he could form a strong alliance with them, he would be able to stand against the betrayal.

Going to war against a House could and probably would make the other houses unite against the emperor. Instead he decided to set a trap and using the centuries long feud between the Harkonnen and Atredis he could make it seem like it was just a house on house war. Duke Leto could not turn down an official order from the Emperor despite suspecting it was a trap as it would make him look weak/foolish/insubordinate/unloyal as Arrakis is a very desirable planet to own and he would have no reason to turn it down as he had no proof.

I just hope we get a ""youthful"", handsome, and charismatic Emperor - which Jackman could definitely pull off as well - and not some old dude like in Lynch's version (no disrespect to that actor as I think he did a fine job - I just didn't like the casting in terms of the original source material).

So anything that is even remotely like AI or just machine learning is strictly forbidden and taboo.",qd6vqv
hhl7q0f,"I'm a little bit sketchy on this as well, but I've always kind of thought about it like this...

So consider human history. A lot of really impressive stuff has been done in the past, and even in very recent human history there was massive industrialization without the use of computers (or computers that didn't suck). We had radio communications before the use of computers, we had factories and mass-produced consumer products before the invention of computers, we went to the moon without computers (or...at least computers that didn't suck ass by present day standards). 

So in the Dune universe, a lot of the stuff they have is possible without computers. When computers are needed, human computers (or Mentats) fill that role. 

I know it's kind of hard to accept the concept, I had a hard time with it too. But I think it's easier to accept once you just run with two key concepts:

1) A lot of *really* cool stuff is actually technically possible without the use of computers.

2) The spice is *REALLY* fucking good at enhancing human abilities. Like, people keep going on about how the Dune universe doesn't have computers. But they do have ""computers"". We see them. They're called mentats and they're humans. Eventually I realized that the only reason I have a problem with that is because I wasn't accepting that humans could be a substitute for computers even with a miraculous mind-altering drug. Which means I was underestimating the importance of the spice. That stuff really is just *that* important.",qd6vqv
hhqf6fh,"They’re not Amish, they’re basically just limited to pre-1970’s technology. Consider what that might look like with 8,000 years to develop and I think what we saw makes sense.

But your point about satellites is a good one. Not sure how useful those are without computers.",qd6vqv
hhsc364,"The idea is that giving up computers forced humans to evolve and develop schools of thought that allowed them to compensate.

The mentat discipline was developed, which enabled people to be trained to perform superhuman feats of computation and complex analysis.

The Spacing Guild is more mysterious, but the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim speculates that they emphasize almost pure mathematics — that might or might not be true; in the original book, how the Spacing Guild are able to pilot their ships is a closely guarded secret. Nobody has ever seen a Guild Navigator, and it is not generally known that they use spice-induced prescient visions to chart a course. The Reverend Mother could have been ignorant of the limited prescience of Guild Navigators, or she could've been hiding the truth from Paul and Jessica. But it could also be that Guild Navigators require highly advanced understanding of maths to utilize their prescience.

The Bene Gesserit cultivated an exquisite degree of mind/body awareness as well as a specialty in political science, assuming the role of subtle manipulators of societies and religion as well as serving as the power behind the throne. They also cultivate bloodlines to produce desired outcomes, with the ultimate goal of realizing the Kwisatz Haderach. Like the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit are aware of the spectrum-awareness properties of the spice and can use it to enhance their abilities, such as inducing a truthsayer trance.

There are other schools that play a more minor role in the story. The Ginaz swordmasters, the Zensunni philsophers, the Suk school, etc.

There are also the Bene Tleilaxu, who have a technological focus, specializing mainly in bioscience and notable in the first book mainly for being the source of the Baron's ""twisted mentat,"" Piter de Vries. (I think the idea is that a mentat needs to have an exceptionally stable temperament, or else their training won't produce a mentat. The Tleilaxu have devised methods to produce mentats of people who would normally be unsuitable.)

So basically, these different schools figured out how to produce superhumans, so computers weren't needed as much anymore.

Also, in exploring the universe (or perhaps through cultivation and breeding), humanity has discovered substances which helped them along. The spice is the biggest one, but there are other drugs which impart some of the same benefits of spice. There's a plant that produces a material called shigawire, which is a very strong metallic wire which, for example, eliminated some of the drawbacks of obsolete technologies like [wire recording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_recording).

Also, what constitutes a proscribed ""thinking machine"" isn't well defined in the books, or at least not in the books the original author penned. The impression I get, which could be wrong, is that pretty much anything that looks like a digital computer is considered blasphemous.

However, there do seem to be machines that act sort of like computers. In the second book there's a ""fencing mirror,"" which is a training dummy powered by ""only servomotors and complex reflector circuits."" It's a machine that is responsive to the person that is sparring with it, mirroring their movements in some fashion. And as the person using the mirror scores hits, the fencing mirror moves faster and uses its mirrored surfaces to create the appearance of more blades, to deceive the attacker.

So that's a pretty sophisticated machine, even by modern standards. It seems to me like it could be Turing complete, but whether that's the case or not, for whatever reason it skirts the conventions against thinking machines. And if I recall correctly, attitudes towards machines like that one are still fairly dubious.",qd6vqv

The story details were framed perfectly so that people who've read the book will know instantly what they're looking at, and those who didn't wouldn't be any worse for wear.

The writing and direction did a good job of cutting out exposition from the book without leaving any troubling holes. We know why spice is important, but we're not left with confusion even when the ""why"" isn't explained. We're given enough visual hints about ""the way"" to get the gist and accept that it will come into play later. We're prompted enough to realise that all the factions are at a knife's edge without needing to know exactly why started it and why. The rest of the plot falls neatly into place.

A good example of this is when >!Paul is attacked by a hunter-tracker, which is briefly shown to be from an assassin and not shown again. But by this point we don't need any more justification, because the brief “political danger awaits us” conversation and shots of each faction make it explicitly clear.!<

Book readers will know in much more detail why it happened and by who, but people like me aren't any less the wiser for it given the way the plot is told.

Where exposition does happen, it doesn't get obnoxious. The opening scene clearly wants to tell us what “the voice” is, but does so and cuts on to the rest of the film without insulting book readers or normal viewers. Paul's little documentary projector tells enough and clears off before overstaying its welcome. This is how an unwieldy book source should be adapted.",qd6vqv

He wants to avoid the jihad but also to survive.  Sometimes there isn't a path that gets you everything you want though.,qd6vqv

hnkogqe,That's man I didn't understand that bit,qd6vqv
hhtxhg6,"You are right. He can see possibilities.

One thing the movie does not touch on is that he has also been trained as a mentat. Essentially a human computer with immense talent for calculation and prediction. Thufir Hawat (the larger 50 somethings Dominican fellow) is a mentat. In the opening scene he calculates how much it costed the imperial representatives to get there in a second.

So, Paul is not only prescient but he also is a human supercomputer. And he sees possibilities of the future, however stay tuned for part two because there seems to be one future that is unavoidable and scares him deeply.",qd6vqv
hhsm8ye,I don’t think that was the point of the scene where Jamis tells him that he will show him the way of the desert. It was a vision of him being a sacrificial lamb for Paul’s transition into manhood/his destiny.

Killing Jamis was that moment where Paul went from boy to man. His old self was dead. So in that way, Jamis *did* kill him. Jamis *did* teach him the ways of the desert. And in that sense, because Chani gave him the knife, Chani also killed Paul with that knife.

hhx1ull,"To a degree, yes. I like that it worked that way but to say ""actually"", nah. And it seems you are familiar with the source material so you should also know that Paul isn't 'interpreting' his visions, but rather seeing the many possibilities and calculating probabilities (due to being a mentat as well).

I like the way Denis handled it in the movie and I do appreciate the possible double meaning in his vision, but I think that's secondary to whats really going on.",qd6vqv
hhx0nf8,"maybe leave this to the people who have read the books, mmmmk",qd6vqv
hhlpgmp,"None of that happens immediately after killing Jamis, though. They have to prepare the water ceremony, and Paul cries there as he plays Jamis' balliset.",qd6vqv
hhlnxwn,"They're timeline probabilities. The visions are all exact, to that particular timeline. The timelines have varying levels of probability of occurring based on actions. So saying they're not exact or true visions isn't really accurate. They're all possible exact visions depending on Paul's choices and the choices of those around him, but with the right formula each one is possible to be an exact vision.

Yeah, that's not really depicted very well in the larger fight scenes for sure.

They touch on this briefly showing the guild representatives in the beginning in the suits with the foggy orange helmets, those were young navigators that haven't mutated fully yet.

In ultra high doses it allows the user to see into possible futures (which is what's happening to Paul through half the movie) but Paul had natural prescience which is why he had dreams before Arakis.

Navigators use the spice to plot their course through foldspace by seeing their possible futures and avoiding the paths that don't end in their destination.

Before the spice every tenth ship or so would just cease to exist when they tried to fold space. It was incredibly risky but the rewards were too high.",qd6vqv
hlmeojs,"Don't worry, it was super obvious in the book as well. The book also has this entire plot point of ""Who is the traitor?"", but it explicitly tells us it's Yueh super early on, so the characters don't know while the read does.

Weakest part of the book, by far. People are up in arms about shit that is missing, but shit like that is what got cut and for good reason.

""Wait, what does that word mean? We need an extra 2 minutes to thoroughly explain that."" Ad nauseum. What does Missionaria Protectiva mean? Well, you already know: it's the Bene Gesserit's superstition spreading project that they explicitly discuss without naming. Why is there a messiah figure that Paul fits for Arrakis?

I'm really glad the movie made her cry though. If anything the fact that she displays these emotions, but then controls them and masters them, just makes her even more powerful in a realistic human way.",qd6vqv
higjpn3,"She didn't seem physically weak, but emotionally not at all what she was in the books. 

The books emphasize her stoicism, control of emotions, attention to detail ability to be a master manipulator. 

Completely lost in the movie and she was by far the most emotional character in the film.",qd6vqv
hhpis7y,"I get that, but she spends half the time quivering and crying before this scene. Plus it just comes off as her being trained to fight, not having near mystical powers of movement.

hhu67p4,"You even say it yourself there was no reason not to show off those emotions. Movies can't give us the characters inner monologue. The movie had to establish Jessica as a deeply emotional person in the few scenes she had before, so that the scene where she both shuts down and hides her emotional response and attunes her emotions to Leto's as a way of manipulating his, is thrown in sharper relief and makes the BG training more obvious and weird.

Had she been some emotionless mask through all the early scenes, then to non-book readers it would've just come across as her not being very emotional.",qd6vqv
hi2ofbx,I thought Chalamet did a great job of getting that across with his own facial expressions without needing Jessica in the hallway as a mirror.,qd6vqv

well yeah but we're seeing her in her private space. why bother masking it. 

>I would have preferred if they showed Paul and Jessica displaying those initial flashes of emotion, but then you see Jessica concentrate and compose herself and this being mirrored by Paul despite being in different rooms.

we see this happen, a lot. i didn't read the books and realised this was a thing she does.",qd6vqv

Villeneuve has a lot of great sense for the technicals but the man is kinda dumb and this is one of the ways it shows, IMO (he also completely dropped the book's anti-colonial themes and made it an unironic hero's journey). DV can't for the life of him get any real substance or meaning into his work. Not saying it's bad work, it's just very shallow writing.",qd6vqv

I'm in the camp that Dune is the first novel.  I know there are quite a few fans of the subsequent works (having read up to God Emperor, I'm not one of them), but my understanding is that this movie series is only going to be about the first book, in two parts.  Given that scope, I think the Bene Gesserit in the first book specifically serve as a powerful faction which has personally influenced Paul's life via Lady Jessica, which is how it is portrayed in the movie.

hhkxm6q,"I 100% agree with you regarding the internal monologue stuff which is why I framed my take as *if* audiences click. 

This first film used visual language as a stand-in for internal monologue and leaned into the idea of expanding action scenes that got glossed over in the novel. *If* audiences respond to that and *if* post-book-one sequels get made then I think the same thing can be achieved.

Think about all the crazy action scenes that get glossed over in ""Messiah"" and ""Children"" in favor of esoteric, internal monologue-y philosophy. If you punch those moments up into proper movie action scenes you've got some fun Scifi films on deck.

I never read the books, or saw the Lynch film, but I enjoyed the lax exposition, because it felt more like we (the audience) were coming to terms with, and understanding what this planet was like, with the characters. There are bits and pieces of this universe that we pick up along the way, rather than having the world building shoved down our throats.

A lot of times they’ll have had a general idea of how they want to construct it, so the assembly will be put together in that way, but sometimes they’ll include full redundant setups if they’re not sure how they want to actually construct the scene in the edit (and this also depends if the director shot a lot of coverage, sometimes they’re much more deliberate so there’s not necessarily a ton of different setups running through huge sections of scenes). 

And then all of these scenes aren’t really edited down in any way (there’s “dead space” before and after which gives them room for controlling timing and pace as they fine tune things, for example). An assembly is very much like taking your clay and shaping it into the vague, general shape of the movie, but you haven’t really done any actual sculpting yet.",qd6vqv

I agree with you about the emphasis on Paul's 'making'. A criticism I read levelled about Paul's character was that he was too ""mature"". A little more touching on Paul being the product of thousands of years of intentional breeding might have alleviated that. The movie was certainly true to Paul's character in the book in that regards.",qd6vqv

Just with how it kept going on about Paul being super special and the chosen one, and him constantly having visions of a romantic interest girl, and him being a go-getter that got looked down on a bit for being young and the next in line for the title of Duke.

I  think that is the case, and the movie just streamlined a lot which shifted the focus.

But it’s never been the definitive Dune movie for me. It’s just a solid movie that happens to have similarities with a fantastic book. 

Villeneuve’s version hits all the right notes for me. Came across as far more faithful to the book. Less shock value and really focused on using the movie as a whole to get points across. 

Villeneuve did a fantastic job of explaining concepts and giving importance to subjects without needing to spend time on exposition that wasn’t necessary to a general audience. The horror of the Harkonnen is given to you slowly, gradually. It’s a combination of actions, dialogue and just scenery that starts the feeling of “there’s something deeply wrong with this House.”

Enough was left in that fans of the source material can understand the references. He essentially left out all the internal monologues and paragraphs of explanations of different people/roles/thoughts. Baron’s servants? His ~~mental~~mentat , so many things come across as functional, yet twisted perversions. Things the audience has been shown are warm and familiar with Atreides, is cold and alien with Harkonnen.

The entire setting of Dune is riddled with purposefully misplaced references to Earth that start to make sense when you realize that all of Earth's old cultures have mixed together.  

It's actually a pretty common trope nowadays in sci-fi to see mixed cultures at the basis of society in other parts of the galaxy.

Star Wars has no relation to Earth at all and even takes place in the past, that's why it purposefully stays away from it and makes everything as alien as possible. The truth is that this is pretty unique for Star Wars in particular.",qd6vqv

Edit: so here is this backstory from the Dune Encyclopedia.

Instead of being from Geidi Prime, Duncan is from Caladan. His family are commoners, but Duncan is discovered during one of the Atreides Population Assesments. After this he is apprentice to house Ginaz where he begins his swordsmaster training. During the War of Assassin's Duncan is taken prisoner. He takes down a bunch of men before getting taken down by a hunter seeker. Duncan is then sold into slavery on Grumman, however his rebellious attitude has him sold off to the Harkonnens when he is Twenty-two.

Duncan works in the mines on Hagal, wanting to return back to Caladan and House Atreides. He escapes using bribes from hoarded jewels from the mines and  seducing a Harkonnen governors daughter. He sends a message back to Caladan and escapes with said governors daughter and is picked up by Gurney Halleck.

Duncan is hailed as a hero upon his return, and worked his way up the Atreides military chain and began training Paul",qd6vqv

I’m happy he’s been able to make quite the career for himself after Thrones, which was an incredible launchpad for him. The same can’t be said for all of the main cast of Thrones, that’s for sure.",qd6vqv

hhwce4o,"Same, the overall story was good and I loved the culture and ecology of Dune but all the characters were pretty unlikable and they made Baron Harkonnen such an over the top caricature of a bad guy - make him obese and ugly, petty and a homosexual rapist that lusts after his own nephew so you really know he's the bad guy.",qd6vqv

Some awesome visuals, Max Richter scoring straight out of the Leftovers, and plenty of mystery to boot. Two characters I'm rooting to die but loving everyone else.

Jamis did teach him the ways of the desert and guide him (but not in the way he thought, instead by fighting him and being his gateway to manhood and joining the Fremen). And this portrayal of Paul's relationship to Jamis is consistent with the book.

Similarly, Jamis did ""kill"" Paul and allow Muad'Dib to be born. During that scene we even hear the voice whispering to Paul that he must die to be reborn.

hhqnbr9,"Yeah, I really hate that it didn't do well enough to get a third film in the franchise, probably.

But it also didn't flop *that* hard. It probably came somewhat close to making its money back in theaters, to say nothing of streaming rights and DVDs and Blu Ray releases.

I would honestly be surprised if that film hasn't made its money back yet, or come very close, not that Hollywood big wigs give a shit. I'm sure it also increased the Blu Ray and DVD sales of the original film(s), which also made the studio money.

Sadly, people in the film industry are pretty myopic, and they were expecting a bit too much out of a sequel to a film that also failed at the box office.",qd6vqv

hi0q06h,Easier to attack Leto not on his own home planet but on Arrakis where he wouldn’t have all his resources and defences properly set up.,qd6vqv
hic8x7q,"It was always a backstab.

They do a pretty good job conveying the feeling in the movie, but there’s an interesting mix of fatalism and optimism in the book. Leto figures that if the emperor is determined to try to set a trap for him, house Atreides may as well try to deal with the obvious trap. And it’s made pretty clear that the Atreides would have won without both Yueh’s betrayal *and* the emperor’s Sardaukar being involved.",qd6vqv
hinoo6d,"They were getting enormously wealthy, richer than the Emperor himself. Taking Arrakis away combined with the plot to betray the Atreides cost them enormously. 

So the Emperor eliminates a potential rival while weakening a troublesome ally, so they remain easy to control. The Emperor uses the Harkonnens as “attack dogs”, the useful brutal family that the Emperor can use to control and shape the universe to keep himself in power while carefully managing their strength so they can never truly rival him.",qd6vqv
hhxln20,"He only ""gave"" Arrakis to the Atredies to put them in a situation where the Harkonnens (aided by his Sardaukar) could catch them flat-footed in a transitional period and merc them. Much easier than trying to invade their home turf of centuries.",qd6vqv
hhxqj5y,The removal of the Harkonnens is the beginning of the trap for the Atreides. It forced them into an unknown environment at a huge disadvantage. Also the lack of satellites over Arrakis ensures the other houses do not know of the betrayal.,qd6vqv
hhpibns,And 10x better visuals. In the new film the room is actually dark lol,qd6vqv
hhtfewb,In the 1984 version there were POV shots for the hunter-seeker so you saw how shitty its vision was.,qd6vqv
hhqaaxs,"Sorry, you are wrong.  A lasgun shield explosion can be just the gun and the shield or it can be atomic level, there's no guarantee on the size.

Paul uses the Atreides family Atomic weapons to break the shield wall, which is a big deal because use of those weapons is forbidden by the Great Convention.  Paul claims it doesn't count because he nuked a mountain and not an army, but at that point the convention doesn't really matter because Paul has the Imperium at sword point",qd6vqv

The white-hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.""

As Badloss says it's random...",qd6vqv
hhom9rd,I thought it was going to happen during duncan's death since it showed his shield was still active when they brought the lasgun to cut through the door,qd6vqv
hhl0l1l,There would be a lot showing other parts of the city. Herbert was all about world building in his description of things. Villeneuve built a very edited world here.,qd6vqv
hhrghd2,"idk just in comparison the original Blade Runner looked really gritty and brimming with detail and all that, for Villeneuve the big stuff is super impressive but there's not as much little trash or details or anything. It's all really beautiful, but it flows into each other, it's really slick and cleanly beautiful in a way so it kinda feels less real to me.",qd6vqv
hhkn2fl,"Liet leaving the Thumper in the ground was one of my favorite bits of visual storytelling. I remember thinking to myself, ""Wow, they didn't even introduce this as a thing that existed until now, yet I can immediately identify its purpose and why she's using it.""",qd6vqv
hhmgaax,"Which is how movies are supposed to be. We don’t need exposition dumps to explain everything like we are children. Show and give enough details so we either understand completely or understand enough even if there is some mystery. 

Like the people upside down dying. I don’t need to know the lore or story…but it is clear that the soldiers they are adding to their attack are fucking brutal.",qd6vqv
hhky3rq,That’s literally what the book is known for. Have you read it? I was curious what people who haven’t read it might think about the myriad of proper nouns without context in the movie.,qd6vqv
hhl3tvh,I wouldn't say they were successful at that. Lot of telling not showing going on for example we were told the Emperor saw House Atreides as a threat but we were never shown them as such.,qd6vqv

Pretty sure that doctor guy gave them a transponder.",qd6vqv

We don't know. What we know is people have had enough of being ""enslaved/controlled"" by machines. How do you interpret this? Is staring at a smartphone screen for millennia count as enslaved? Brian Herbert interpreted the Jihad as Skynet, but I think Frank used a much more subtle language so you interpret however you want.",qd6vqv
hhmld8p,"It’s more about the aesthetic of all those things than the explanation of why they exist. At least give me craftsmanship for Duncan’s sword. They are the blandest looking pieces of scrap metal imaginable. The tooth swords the desert people had were cooler than anything the high tech people had. 

I understand AI is illegal in this world and explaining that doesn’t add to the story in the movie. I get that. Still, whether it comes from the book or the movie, personal shield tech exists yet the best method they came up with to deal with it is… small swords. That came off as lazy writing for me and it kind of made the fight choreography seem meh. Did a blade ever even hit another blade?",qd6vqv
hhlv6ec,"I could certainly live with that being the case, but I thought the design of said objects was still underwhelming.",qd6vqv
hho0s60,Kinda-sorta. It’s more that it took the sci-fi / fantasy hybrid stories that were popular at the time and tried to make it work. Hence things like shields making guns obsolete and computers being banned. Also if you read between the lines it makes it clear that the Imperium kinda sucks ass for just about everyone who lives in it.,qd6vqv
hhl5wdt,"I agree. For me, details like that dampened the extent of Paul's transformation in the later scenes that felt so much more drastic in the book.",qd6vqv
hhm46b6,"Paul says the beginning in the trailer, so I was surprised it wasn't in the movie.",qd6vqv
hhkpl7c,I mean that wasn’t what I was referring to exactly. Though I cannot imagine any adaptation of Dune that doesn’t use those lines.,qd6vqv
hhlfdj9,They call Paul the Lisan Al Gaib and the Mahdi a few times.,qd6vqv
hhlkr3s,"I feel that will always be the case when it comes to art that costs millions to make.
Though I for one rally behind films that takes general audiences out of their comfort zones.
I feel as though denis probably had to fight and fight hard for the ideas and concepts HE DID successfully translate from book to screen.
David lynch did the same and they screwed him pretty hard by only giving him a single film to translate his vision along with the production value of a potato.
Sometimes a screen adaptation can be better than the book it’s based on. Like fight club or American Psycho.
But more often than not it’s always to bring more attention to the novel that it’s based on. 
And denis is doing an amazing job bringing more and more eyes to “dune” and hard sci-fi in general.
I for one had never even thought of giving dune a glance.
But when I saw that first trailer a year ago and a half ago. And decided to crack it open and give it a shot.
I fell in love with it instantly and since have worked my way up until “messiah”.
Even if this adaptation left a lot of details out. It certainly succeeds in getting the spirit of the novel on screen.",qd6vqv

hhltae6,"While it could be argued that Littlefinger 'betrayed' Ned, the fact of the matter was that Ned didn't have the forces to do much of anything once Robert was dead. At *best*, he could have realized it was hopeless and fled the capital.

Nor were the Lannisters 'jealous' of him. The Lannisters would have much preferred that he simply not have gone snooping and there was no malice or family competition involved. Ned just found out the wrong things and potentially undermined their power.

Jon Snow never traveled to a desert. Nor did Dune (much less Game of Thrones) invent the ""Prince who was Promised"" theme. I suggest you read your Bible.

Tywin and the Baron are worlds apart as characters. Tywin was not a needlessly cruel man, but simply a pragmatic one. He wasn't trying to create a civil war but found one thrust upon him. He was ruthless, but it's tough to call him an asshole - the people he treated poorly were almost invariably idiots who were making his life far more difficult than it needed to be.

Alia was not an assassin. At best, you could claim she 'assassinated' the Baron, but this wasn't because of some exceptional training. It was due to the already-defeated-but-might-not-yet-have-realized-it Baron not considering that a pre-pubescent girl might be carrying poison.

Nor did House Lannister wipe out House Stark. Arya, Sansa and Bran all survived. Lannister had no role in killing Rickon and it's unlikely they would have even bothered. They went out of their way to *not* kill Sansa. Likewise, if Rob hadn't gone South with an army, it's likely that dealing with a breakaway North would have been filed in their day planner under ""things to do some day"" - they had no intention of invading the North.

Houses represented by animal sigils is a well-established tradition in European heraldry, as is a single monarch.

I get a lot of people struggled with all the terms in the books and all the weird exposition (princess irulan chapters intros talking about plot points that haven't happened yet)

But the movie cut out all the confusing and kinda useless crap hahaha.

And the terms ? There was enough context with the inflection, tone, music, what was occurring, and surrounding words. Like i think most could tell all the different words/names people called Paul was basically ""messiah"". The landsaraad? Only mentioned when referring to ""the other great houses of the landsaraad"". So even if you don't really know that word, you've got ""go warn the great houses of X, when the great houses of X hear about this"" they explained spice very well and gave enough info I think of the bene gesserit order that you need to know to follow along at this point.

Plus the average movie audience in 2021 is MUCH smarter than in the 70s/80s and are MUCH more familiar with Sci fi and fantasy concepts and tropes now. It's no longer fringe.

This is a population that watched 8 years of a song of ice and fire which was very complex. This is a population that now have all seen 40 hours of star wars including the mandalorian. This is a population that has all seen lord of the rings. This is a population that has seen 20 hours of Harry Potter. Everything aside from LOTR, HEAVILY influenced by dune. Like Ned stark is basically a direct rip off of Duke Leto lol

It's basically take Harry Potter/Jon snow/anakin and make his mom alive and put him in game of thrones politics with a star wars setting.

The average audience can grasp it. They've been primed from all the other stuff that came after dune and was influenced by it. This is where everything they loved in pop culture in the last 20 years basically came from.",qd6vqv

The visions where Paul dies and then when he doesn’t die would also be pretty confusing, at least within the constraints of only this one movie.

Or Jessica being too emotional (although this one I suspect is for visual purposes, but still, it was strange.. she could at least compose herself after each time or something).

For all of these points, the answer is the same - the audience needs to be informed.  In the book the audience can be informed by literally narrating how 'Paul figured it out himself' etc.

Yeah, I think that was a problem in the movie vs. the book.

The book clearly indicated that the mental conditioning of Suk doctors was supposed to make it impossible to betray their clients.  The Harkonnens even went to extreme lengths to disguise the fact that the traitor was a Suk doctor.  It would have shocked the universe, in that it was thought to be impossible (and never done before).

Successfully turning a Suk doctor was actually the real trick/accomplishment that allowed the Harkonnen's to ""win.""  And no one would have thought to protect against the impossible.  It didn't even enter Thurfir Hawat's mind as a possibility.  In the book it was made clear that the Harkonnen's kept Hawat's mind focused on Lady Jessica as the traitor.",qd6vqv

Jamis says that the strongest leads, but Stilgar has been bested by Jessica. Therefore, he invokes a leadership challenge. Stilgar reminds him that he can't challenge a Sayyadina (a holy woman), which Jamis is of course aware of. He therefore demands a champion, and since none of the Fremen have a dog in this fight, it falls to Paul, which Jamis wanted.

He couldn't challenge Paul directly, he had no reason to challenge over. And Stilgar had already made the call that Jessica and Paul were to be protected. He could have challenged Stilgar over that, but didn't want to - Stilgar was the leader for a reason. Jamis knew he simply would have died. He figured he could take Paul though.",qd6vqv

I get that you found these plot points interesting and that's why you're upset they aren't in the film. I'm trying to explain that they don't matter at all to someone with less knowledge about the books. They aren't required for the plot or the characters to make sense.

And it would give the true justification for Chani to give that friendly ending line ""this is just the beginning"" - she comes to respect and admire Paul only after the fight, because of his reaction to it in the book. Not showing Chani changing her mind about Paul played very poorly in the movie.

hhnha56,"Just read the book and stop crying. 

I mean that’s what you want isn’t it? You just want the book. If you don’t believe a movie should be made into a book or it can’t be, then what exactly do you want? 

Like did you want them to totally change the story? 

“It was made today though, art should reflect that” is not a good argument because this is a cover song and not a brand new piece. 

Plus, art doesn’t HAVE TO BE anything. At all.",qd6vqv
hhrtpc9,"(1) the duke and his son had a real relationship. It was shown to be one of trust and love. The scene of them in the graveyard conveyed so much about the duke, his past, his desires, and his relationship with Paul. All in the span of a few lines of dialogue. Then their relationship was reinforced throughout the film in many ways, even subtle ones like when duke walked into the meeting and put his hand on Paul’s back in a showing of affection. Their relationship was full of depth and substance despite the minimal amount of scenes they shared. 

(2) Paul’s relationship with his mother was equally deep and real. We see this from the first scene of them together. When Jessica is dismissed and Paul has 0 problems saying “you dare dismiss my mother in her own home!?”  Then we see her terror as he’s in the room. She’s scared for him, deeply, but torn because of her devotion to the Bene gesserit. It conveyed such a deep bond between them, and deep conflicting in her. Then, as said above, this bond is explored and shown throughout the film. All of that is substance. It’s real emotion. And it’s done beautifully. 

There’s a ton more. But i literally don’t want to type a 10 page essay. All of this is to say i thought the movie was full of depth, and was far from a beautifully shot film without any substance. On the contrary, i was fully immersed into the world because of the substance, the depth of the character, the bonds we were shown and could feel between them. Without the substance, it would have felt hollow, but i never once felt a hollowness. All of this is my opinion of course, but i would never agree with the assertion that this movie lacked substance",qd6vqv

hicw53o,"To the point about understanding spice, I don't see how the film could've been any more explicit about what it is and why it is important. It's covered as well as can be expected in the opening monologue and some characters even repeat some of the key points, almost verbatim. If anything, I found it almost too on the nose.

hhu1xps,"The early evidence they're evil:

* Chani's exposition at the beginning, when they ruled over her planet, they've oppressed her people.  
* Gurney expresses similar thoughts about them when sparring with Paul.  
* The bows when Bautista enters the throne room are pretty clearly bows of someone who is in great fear.  
* They cemented their own man into the walls, merely in the off chance someone important ended up in Paul's room.  
* They rule over a polluted industrial hell planet.",qd6vqv

That's just your personal opinion. Your personal opinions can't be taken as facts because someone who didn't read the books might have a completely different opinion and enjoyed the film as seen by some of the comments in this thread from non-readers who liked the film. There are 1.9k comments in this sub at the moment of writing my comment, remember that not everyone who watched the film shares the same view as yours and not everyone is obligated to share your views.

There's some family feud between them many years ago but it isn't discussed at length. Gurney hates them because he lost his sister to them if I remember correctly. Problem with the book is it does more telling than showing. It's filled with too many internal monologues of the characters.",qd6vqv

hhtuts0,"Well done. I see your critic has fled in the face of your logic.

I just finished Lynch's 1984 Dune (watched Villenueve's Dune last night) because I was so convinced that Lynch is the superior filmmaker after seeing V's tepid garbage that I wanted to take some notes.

I'm not sure if you've seen Lynch's version, but he opens the film with a Star Wars-esque monologue by Princess Irulan that explains things so. much. better. than they ever are in V's version. 

The gom jabbar scene, too, is masterfully handled. Lynch actually *shows* Paul's vision of his hand through a translucent version of the top of the box--the viewer sees the flesh burning away in all its 1980s practical effects glory. The Reverend Mother, too, narrates the pain. The viewer gets an actual real sense of what torture Paul endures. In V's version, it's just a bunch of silence and Chalamet looking like he's trying to take a fat shit.

I'm not going to defend the narrative choices/moviemaking in the second half of Lynch's film lol, but at lease I can say it's a hot, frockling mess vs V's cold mess.",qd6vqv
hhsnldt,"The other houses don't like the harkonnens and wouldn't support the baron as emperor.  And, house harkonnen isn't powerful enough to wage war against the other houses alone.

Wow no plot there either.",qd6vqv
hhsjqi3,">  I didn't hear the name of that planet in the film.

Shocker.",qd6vqv
hhywlet,"I think its because the story is being told entirely from Paul's perspective after the attack.  He gets separated from the rest of the Atreides house (save for Idaho), so we're just left wondering (as he is) what happened to the rest.

In the old movie, he does get away after the attack and signs on with some spice smugglers, and ultimately reunites with Paul (with a memorable line I hope they retain - you young pup!)",qd6vqv
hhycqz7,"Why Hawat's storyline is cut? Time probably, DV likes his long landscape shots(which are beautiful) and they probably didn't want the movie to be 3+ hours for the first part. If you want some back story on what's missing Hawat is a human computer and one of the Atredies lieutenants. Computers are in general banned in the Dune universe due to a massive war called the butlerian jihad, so instead they genetically made human computers as a replacement. Hawat is the best of them, and a master of all things plotting and assassination. 

In the books there's an important subplot that there is a traitor in their midst, which is basically cut, Hawat believe the traitor to be Lady Jessica, there's a lot of reasons why that I won't go into, but after the killing of Duke Leto, Hawat switches sides to work with the Harkonens as their Mentat(human computer) died in the poison attack. He does this to find and kill Jessica, and to bring down the Harkonens from the inside. All of this is cut from the film which is a shame as it leads to a lot of character interactions that never happen and never will happen in part 2 that are fantastic.",qd6vqv
hhuzo6b,Ah I see. So the Fremen could still conceivably control spice production in the universe.,qd6vqv
hhrjw20,"A difference between a book and a movie is that it's much easier to go deep into lore than it is in a movie without bogging the work down.

hi1lp11,Why?,qd6vqv
hifjlvs,"> The line ""he's a jealous man, a dangerous jealous man"" could have been spoken on Arrakis. The Reverend Mother could have met the Baron on site before or during the dinner table scene.

I don't think it still would have made sense, seeing as at the time Baron was 'kicked' out of the planet as ownership of fiefdom changed. It also does that in the books too, where in chapter 2 they say something like ""in Geidi Prime... something something"" - and they briefly describe the streets in a sentence or two. I don't see why they should change that just because people might see Geidi Prime for a second and want more? I mean it's just a planet ... which we will see more of later.

> How do the Fremen survive?

They use stillsuits when travelling across desert. They have secret labs where they grow green plants (it's shown in the movie, a room with green plants), they even show the Fremen spitting into some machine which converts their spit into water to instantly make coffee (It's Spice Coffee, but all you need to know is they can live quite comfortably, enough to make luxuries such as coffee).

> You're told in advance Where did the Harkonnen invasion come from?

You're not told in advance in the movie, in the movie you find out where the invasion came from the instant Gurney Halleck comes out of the Noble building and he yelps ""Oh my god"" (or something like that). You find out the same moment he does and you see him looking up at the sky where you can see fleets of ships coming down from one of those huge cylindrical shaped  starships (the same sort Atredeis family used to come to Arrakis).

> You've seen the educational video Are the Bene Gesserit sketchy?

You find out more about the Bene Gesserit as the story progresses, some things are revealed as late as the final chapter in the book and used as a closing.

> It almost makes me feel there are no challenges Paul faces that weren't explained to him beforehand. Be it through his dreams, his projector or his mother.

Oh Paul has challenges but they are mostly mental. If you rewatch the movie or if not just rewatch the scene where Paul is in the tent with his mom in the middle of the desert. Everything in that scene leading up to when he gets mad at his mother, everything in that is crucial. Compare his frame of mind there to the ending of the movie where he just willingly goes with the Fremen, even though his mother had the plan to get off the planet. 

Also, everything after the tent scene, whenever Lady Jessica turns up keep an eye out for expressions on Rebecca Fergusson's face. Specially when Paul makes choices.

I will say, some parts like the scene in the tent could have had more screen time and more emphasis on.",qd6vqv

hl5qlfs,"Not so sure about the last part, I heard almost all the dialogue perfectly fine, even pauls whisper in the harvester scene (which is super quiet on hbo max). The only issue the music getting really loud at times.

hhmzajn,"Yeah it heavily expects you to have knowledge of the book which is one of the things I take issue with. The others are lack of character depth and development. If it wouldn't have had those issues it would be a lot better.

However, from my understanding, there is a lot of character depth and development in the books that likely doesn't translate to a 2 hour and 40 minute film. This is the main factor why I and others here felt like a TV series would have been better. 

Dune is an extremely complex story on par with Game of Thrones or even The Foundation series. Many filmmakers over the years have voiced their opinions that Dune just can't work as a film due to it's complexity. 

This is why I imagine the director left some thing out because he was trying to simplify it for the audience but instead those missing pieces just led to confusion amongst the general audience. So far it looks like the consensus is that it's better the Lynch's but still confusing.",qd6vqv

This could be a spoiler but: >!The Baron is also drastically underestimating how many Fremen there really are!

And they have Paul who studied from some of the best fighters and is just learning how powerful he can truely be. (He killed a Fremensoldier easily in the film/books)!<",qd6vqv
hhtzrdw,"I read the book years ago so some details are a little fuzzy, but here’s my attempt at an answer:

The emperor sees the Duke as a long-term threat that must be eliminated before he grows too powerful. He can’t attack the Duke directly since the other houses would revolt (an emperor that attacks houses at his whim would upset the balance of power). However, the Atreides/good guys and the Harkonnens/bad guys have been feuding since forever and there’s nothing disallowing one from attacking the other. 

Thus, the best way for the emperor to eliminate the Atreides would be to give the Atreides little time to prepare (hence why they were suddenly given Arrakis) and to secretly support the Harkonnens with his Sardaukar, the most deadly soldiers in the Imperium. This aspect is done better in the book, where the Sardaukar are actually disguised as Harkonnen soldiers so that there’s no evidence of the emperor’s involvement.

Regarding the Atreides, they’re aware that it’s most likely a trap, but their hands are tied by the emperor’s decree. They go to Arrakis hoping that they’ll find a way out. They probably had no chance of winning, given the fact that there was a traitor in their house and that the Harkonnens spent A LOT on the attack thanks to their spice profits. Spice-mining equipment can always be replaced, but an opportunity for the Harkonnens and the emperor to eliminate a mutual enemy would be too good to give up",qd6vqv
hhvfttb,"It is a little bit convoluted and dumb but the idea is that, even though they don't take part in the story, there are a lot more ""Great Houses"" besides just the Atreides and Harkonnen. The Emperor's biggest fear is that a leader emerges who consolidates enough influence with them to overthrow him, because his personal army isn't big enough to fight all of them at once. Leto was starting to develop into that figure, an unofficial figurehead for the Landsraad (the ""senate"" of the Great Houses), so the Emperor wanted that potential threat nipped in the bud.

HOWEVER, if the Emperor just attacked the Atreides directly with no causus belli, he'd make a martyr of them, and turn the other Great Houses against him out of the fear that any one of them could be picked off like that with impunity in the future. This is why Paul wanted Kynes to get word of what happened off the planet and why Paul even thought he might have leverage to blackmail the Emperor.

The point of this plot was for the Emperor to get rid of the Atreides via the Harkonnen with plausible deniability that he was involved at all. The movie does mention that there no satellites around Arrakis (also true in the book), so no one who wasn't at the site of the battle will witness it. In addition, in the book, the Sarduakar the Emperor sends to help are all outfitted in Harkonnen gear and uniforms. 

A factor from the book that I think the movie didn't handle well is the idea that in this setting ""wars of assassins"" are considered business as usual between Great Houses and not a breach of the peace or cause for Imperial intervention. As Judge of the Change Kynes's job wasn't to ensure the Harkonnens didn't sabotage and assassinate, her job was to ensure their sabotage and assassination fell within the socially proscribed limits. 

> What if the good guys figured out the double cross and won the fight?

In the book, Leto does know he's being set up by the Emperor. Things still turn out this way anyway because his enemies commit an overwhelming, disproportionate force against him.

> Also bad guys/emperors men just blow up a large amount of the town and factory that is needed to get the spice..............why blow that all up if not needed?

The complaints about it not being fully explained are kind of funny. It's not really explained the the level that most readers are familiar with in the books narrative alone. It takes the second book and a bunch of appendices to really flesh out the role of spice in universe.

You need to distract and disrupt your opponent with quick attacks, so that you can sneak in a slow attack while they're worried about something else, or while you have them in a compromising position. So you argument doesn't make sense from the perspective of how the fights should actually work. 

But even that is besides the main point. Which is that slow fighting isn't cinematic. So the fights didn't look good and weren't viscerally exciting if you care about fight choreography. They weren't shot well. The full body blurry flash when there was a fast impact on a shield made everything indecipherable.

Thank you for describing it this way, because especially compared to modern sci-fi I would describe Dune more as futuristic fantasy.

I would have loved to see the way the drug Yueh gave him effected him to the point where >!he mistook Piter de Vries for Baron Harkonnen!<, and just the pure tragedy of failing even his last chance at vengeance (because his constant failures are a big point of his character) - I do get why they chose to do it differently in the film though, considering it's already very heavy on prophecy, dreams, unclear visions, ect.

A fight breaks out and the woman beats the leader, who then suggests they both join the group. Another fremen disagrees, and says that as the woman beat their leader she is now the leader and he wants to fight her to the death to take charge.

Any Fremen has the right to challenge an order in a non battle situation.

That's the problem. These are not the same thing at all. If he's calculating possible futures, then his wildly divergent calculations shouldn't also be obviously true if viewed through the lense of even mild abstraction.

Like I said, what is shown on screen is actually abstract visions that come true, just not literally.

All this seems totally mishandled in the film. It botched the contrast that's supposed to take place when the Duke dies. Where Jessica was a mother and wife to a powerful man, she then becomes a widow and subjugated to her son the new Duke, a perversion/inversion of her former power.

There’s a whole genre of films and TV shows where it’s *only* people talking. No explosions at all. It’s incredibly common, and critically acclaimed.

hi0k7bx,"> For sure. Even this performance aside, I happen to really like the dude a lot. He’s extremely charismatic and everything I’ve seen / heard about him outside of acting suggests he’s a really good dude. 

I'm not sure I've seen anyone deny that.  I think even a lot of the people who accuse him of playing himself would agree that he seems pretty likeable and charismatic, and that makes it really easy to root for him.  I think he's also just always fun to watch.  There have been times when I've watched Jason Momoa in a movie and just felt like I was watching Jason Momoa, I've never watched him and not been entertained.  He may not be the most versatile actor out there, but he's more versatile and talented than a lot of people give him credit for, he's pretty much always fun to watch, and he seems likeable in real life.

Really, I think there are a lot of actors like that.  Jack Black's another example - gets accused of playing himself a lot, his style of comedy isn't for everyone, but he does have roles showing some versatility, and even when he's just doing his Jack Black thing he's entertaining, likeable, and it's ridiculous to act like he's not good at what he does.

It's also kind of inconsistent.  I feel like Eugene Levy plays the same style of character in everything he's in (or at least everything I've seen him in), but I don't see people criticize him for that.  He's just so ridiculously good at playing that type of character and he's entertaining every time.

For that matter, I've never seen anyone criticize Christopher Lee for how similar most of his characters are.  No one accuses him of playing himself for obvious reasons, but he's an actor who made his career not by being a versatile chameleon who can disappear into any role he's in (the moment he starts talking you know you're watching Christopher Lee), but just by being incredibly iconic and good at playing a particular type of role.  And he gets tons of justified praise for it because he could bring a sense of presence, charisma, power, and authority to a villain that few other actors could even come close to.

In the end, chameleons like Gary Oldman deserve all the praise they get, but specialist actors who mostly play one type of character but play them well definitely often get more criticism than they deserve, especially when the type of character they play is seen as similar to their real life personality (I say ""seen as"" because, of course, most of us don't actually know what someone like Jason Momoa or Jack Black is actually like off-screen - their on-screen characters just seem similar enough to their out-of-character public personas that people just assume they're barely even acting).",qd6vqv
hhsbr93,Refusing that path doomed his only son to it though.,qd6vqv
hhx9wab,"Oh yeah, great points.  Baron is a absolute caricature.  

The only character I really liked in the books was Leto.  Leto was the man.  There were spurts where Jessica was a good character, but she was pretty unlikable too, mostly.

I thought the movie *really* benefited from something that usually hurts book-to-movie adaptions -- *you couldn't hear anyone's inner monologue.*  Where this usually hurts adaptions, like Harry Potter and Hunger Games, is that you can't hear the characters weighing options, thinking through problems, and justifying their actions.  These pieces of inner monologue make characters MUCH more likable in general, but in Dune's case, it works against them because of all of their insane, elitist, over-bearing pretentiousness.  By the end of Dune I literally hated all of the protagonists and was actively rooting for the bad guys to just win and kill everyone.  I couldn't stand anyone.

hhualg0,I believe you are right. Because everyone is telling a story or such about Jamis or giving a gift but Paul never actually knew him/Freman funal rights. So he cries and they say he gives water to the dead. It has been a bit since I read it but something close to that.,qd6vqv

Like you already have so much stuff the reader has to understand between the worlds, the culture, the political system, etc. the tedium of needing to explain everyday items and roles is pretty annoying.

But in the movie, a dagger is a dagger. Doesn't need to be explained. The religious book Gurney is reading doesn't need explanation either. And I didn't see a Balliset but if we did, it wouldn't need to be explained. Or the plant life. Takes 15 seconds in the movie, but much longer in the book. 

Imo, the movie is able to cut through the tedium and bullshit that weighed down the book in a big way. There's so much invention in the book that it's really hard to follow at times, and is exhausting sometimes. I may read the book again now that I'm more familiar with stuff but the first read through was a slog",qd6vqv

Also. Liet was my fav side character in the books. He was a dude in the books. I thought changing him to a her would hurt just because the fremen are very patriarchal (think traditional middle eastern culture). I had a very distinct picture of him in my head and miss knowing what his adapted image would look like. 

Anyway, I'm happy details of showing not telling are abundant and clear.",qd6vqv
hhpuzpp,"I just watched, and I maybe I’m misremembering but there was a line or two of dialogue that explained exactly what the thumper was doing that felt slightly forced. Isn’t that what Jason Momoa was passing around in the barracks after his scouting mission?

Loved the movie so not complaining lol",qd6vqv
hhmow4j,"I will say in the movie there are a few things I wish they had explained more a little earlier. Mainly I don’t think they really touched on Mentats aside from Hawats little calculation in the beginning. Overall, I thought it was a good movie and I hope Part 2 does a little more world building if we are going to carry on into Children, which would make a awesome movie, and God emp.

hhm2hs6,"That and the ""book flms(?)"". Just tell about sand walking, worms, and dust. That was like the only thing that felt off for a gifted heir to a great house to be listening to before going to a new world. Like he hadn't heard of the most valuable resource before?

Finished watching it a hour ago and already forgot about that part. Getting old sucks.",qd6vqv

hho318e,"> Still, whether it comes from the book or the movie, personal shield tech exists yet the best method they came up with to deal with it is… small swords.


In the book it’s made clear that there are fairly strict rules of war that are theoretically meant to keep civilian casualties to a minimum (this is partly why the Atreides were so blindsided by the Harkonnen attack), and after the Butlerian Jihad that made all computers and a lot of automation illegal, human culture shifted to focus on “maximising human potential”. At least, in theory - for all the talk of human potential, the society only gets there through things like eugenics and strictly conditioning people for certain tasks from childhood. Technically they could get around the shield problem in other ways (this happens in the later books in the series that are set quite a while after the first one), but those aren’t in line with their culture.


The implication in the original books wasn’t an AI uprising, it was more of a religious and cultural war - the AI stuff was added in by the really terrible books written by Frank Herbert’s son.",qd6vqv
hhx86wf,"I quite liked the look of the swords.  They, like the rest of costuming, seemed grounded and *real.*

Military equipment would be simple and functional.  I'm glad they went with the flat machete look rather than something over-the-top flashy/fantasy.  The armor was also very rugged and simple.  I appreciated the aesthetic.",qd6vqv

My theory is that Herbert based that color on the fact that authentic cinnamon (not the stuff we get in the 'States usually) turns blue when exposed to iodine.

The blue-within-blue eyes is definitely a nice tie in to the blue description in the books (the first book never describes it, just that it smells always like cinnamon but changes each time you smell it).",qd6vqv

That's totally fine and your opinion. The fact that we have differing opinions means that it is subjective. And not objective. My opinion doesn't hold equal weight because you choose not to put ours on the same level. What happened to critical discussion.

Bradford Young (DP on Arrival) works with much lower contrast than Deakins (too low for my liking, truth be told) and Greig Fraser (DP on Dune) works with much lower exposures than Deakins usually does. Dune looks *amazing* in low-light scenes, because that is Fraser's specialty. Deakins would have made it look amazing in his own way, but not in the same way.

Villeneuve is a very skilled director, but - much like Ridley Scott - his films look quite different depending on who's shooting them.",qd6vqv

hhu8ni3,">Tywin was not a needlessly cruel man, but simply a pragmatic one.

He gets a barracks full of soldiers to rape Tyrion's wife then forces Tyrion to do the same. Then gets Jaime to lie to Tyrion that she had been a whore all along. There was no reason for such cruelty. He could have just had her silently poisoned and taken more of a firm hand with Tyrion's education.

He brutally murders Elia and Rhaenys, when Elia would have been a great hostage to ensure Dorne's compliance, and Rhaenys could have been married to Robert's first son to solidify the dynasty's grip on the Iron Throne. There was no reason for such cruelty, and in fact, he made almost everyone of equivalent social standing to him hate him with this move.

He has the Mountain reave the Riverlands so badly that some noble houses go extinct. And all this because Tyrion, a son he hates, was taken hostage. This is because Tywin values pride in his legacy over everything. His overweening pride will soon be the downfall of his house, with his dwarf son set against his legacy and his incestuous twins bringing down disaster after disaster upon House Lannister.

He is a vain, cruel man who has one hammer (kill everyone horribly to strike fear of the Lannisters in all hearts) and every problem he is faced with, including when his children are the problem, looks like a nail. He is far from pragmatic, he just looks that way compared to Cersei and Littlefinger, two almost cartoonishly villainous characters in a world that's generally more grey.

EDIT: But RE: Dune inspiring ASOIAF's plot, yeah nah. But GRRM almost certainly got inspiration for some of the more outragous cruelties from Dune though.",qd6vqv

There aren't any major events that define the plot that we're missing by not having it, but it would have been a nice break in the film's action that would also have allowed us to see the personalities of the people we care about a bit more.",qd6vqv

—no one steps forward at all?  We are told he is a good fighter. So why would anyone volunteer to risk dying (since we are told yielding is not part of the rules) over something they don’t care about?  What happens to his whole challenge if no one volunteers?

And the Emperor could lend troops(in Harkonnen gear and uniforms) to an all out war on house Atreides. The Dr guy sabotages there planets defenses and Harkonnens with Emperor's guy whip them out.

Why doesn't the Emperor fear the Harkonnen more. Didn't the movie even say the Harkonnen have more wealth then the Emperor? Seems they are a bigger threat.

It comes across as metaphorical in the book but the visions add an additional layer to that sentiment that aligns with everything else we know about Paul and his visions.

In regards to Paul's ability to see the possible futures, recall the quote from the Reverend Mother about an animal caught in a trap.

The movie seems to be just a bit more self aware than it's source material, especially in having the filmbook narrator have a vaguely early 1900s ""British documentarian"" voice as it describes the Fremen as a savage people.

As it is in the finished version, I'd say ""it was good but could have been better""

I understand that's how it was done in the books.

I don't believe that translates well to a movie that should be an event you sit down for, and are done with when the credits roll.

You can tell a story visually, that doesn't mean visuals are always storytelling.

>When you compare ""visuals"" to ""dialogue"" what you are actually comparing is ""the cinematic language"" to ""the english language"" and telling me that you only understand one of them.

Most of the visuals were not telling a story. That you would attempt to condescend and pretend I don't understand while ignoring this fact is telling of the (lack of) substance to your argument. 

>So they are at the same point in the story.

I like how you're trying to nitpick an irrelevant point, even if the mini series was behind at that point it's still nearly half the length and the point stands. 

>The bit we are talking about here is how the spice is actually used for space travel.

That's one bit we were talking about before the context of the discussion expanded. 

The movie puts emphasis on visuals over telling the story, more so than either of the other adaptions. This is objective fact. End of story.

Being on a big screen doesn’t necessarily equal epic. (And capitalizing it doesn’t make your point as well as you think it does).

He knows he's not seeing things as they are necessarily destined to happen, but he pulls truths from the symbology of his visions. So he's making moves off a gut feeling. He wouldn't survive on Arrakis without the practical knowledge he got from studying Fremen ways prior to leaving his home planet, but throughout the movie we see him trusting his visions and gut feelings more and more, ultimately leading to the point that he no longer believes the path has been cleared for him by others but that he is deserving of his destiny as the Messiah because of his power. It's the combination of his practical skills and his powers that ultimately lead him to the Fremen & allow him to inherently understand their ways. However, what i felt was a little nuanced in the movie is that each time Paul is exposed to spice, his powers grow stronger. To me, Dune has a major theme of ""is Paul actually the Messiah or was he just propped in the perfect position for it?"" His powers growing stronger and stronger lead us to believe that he IS the Messiah, however there is still centuries of planning and groundwork by others that support him, not to mention the mysterious psychoactive effects of spice.",qd6vqv

But the casual moviegoers most I came across are saying it's a decent adaptation. Very few had complaints that the film doesn't have much depth to characters but given how dense the book is I think streamlining the source material and taking out some plot complexity is the best thing they did.

hhrs9uh,"The personal shields block fast moving objects (During the training scene, Gurney mentions ""the slow blade penetrates the shield"" or something like that) are so are basically perfect against bullets. The one exception, which they show a couple times in the movie are those drill-like bullets, that hit the shield and then slowly drill through it, but even they aren't the most effective as they can be deflected off before they break through.",qd6vqv
hipw40h,"> What's the explanation for why swords are used so much more than traditional firearms? I figured honor was a big part of it but it would make sense that the shields have an effect as well.

So they have lasguns, which are pretty much your standard sci-fi laser gun. These cut through pretty much anything and everything. They also have shields, which stop fast moving-objects (a little more complicated than that, but that's the gist). Things like projectiles/weapons are archaic. I mentioned in a different comment, it'd be like saying in 2021 ""how come no one uses catapults or slingshots anymore?"". Plus, shields would render these weapons completely useless. But they do have nuclear weapons (referred to as atomics), but also have something of a pact to not use them, similar to our modern day, basically a form of MAD.

However, the technology behind the shields and lasguns clashes. If a beam touches a shield, it creates something of a feedback loop where both the source (the lasgun) and the target (the shield) are destroyed. And apparently, this is a completely random magnitude. It could cause the gun to just blow up in your hands, or it could go off like a nuke. Now you have guns/artillery rendered useless, but also lasguns.

So really, in the absence of computers for things like missiles and guidance systems, all that's really left is hand-to-hand combat and poison. However, the Harkonnens did use ancient artillery to their advantage in Dune. In the book, the Atreides soldiers run and hide in the surrounding cliffs and caves. They are then shelled by artillery, sealing them inside, and this tactic was completely out of left field.",qd6vqv

There were a few big issues going on - the Atreides had managed to train a small fighting force to be almost as good as the Sardaukar, which threatened the Emperor’s power, but he couldn’t move against them directly before they trained any more because they were also super popular in the Landsraad. Baron Harkonnen had also made an offhand remark that could be taken to mean that he knew the Sardaukar weren’t just regular guys given awesome training, but came from the death-world Salusa Secundus - which was the real reason why they were such incredibly good fighters, and given that the Baron had control of Arrakis, he might also try to take advantage of it to train up Sardaukar of his own. The Emperor’s plan was for the Harkonnens to use up their money to destroy the Atreides (the *huge* expense of using Guild ships for military operations is constantly talked about in the early part of the book), and then make them look incompetent enough afterwards that he could wipe them out take over Arrakis directly. !<",qd6vqv

>these points are all self-contained in the original novel as well.

Can you explain these points without using the other novels then?  Because I cannot.

My understanding is that Denis intended Dune to be two movies, not three.

For several reasons, it didn’t happen, and I agreed to the challenge of making part one and then wait to see if the movie rings enough enthusiasm.](https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a38016847/dune-2-release-date-cast-news/)”""",qd6vqv

It's a beautiful and haunting ad, but I wanted to know what part 1 wanted to achieve besides marketting Zendaya for part 2.",qd6vqv
hho0tem,"I think the issue is that the movie was both rushed (in terms of story) and dragged on (in terms of individual scenes). 

Some scenes were wayyy too slow and self-indulgent, like all those brooding shots where the camera is just lingering on someone's face. Meanwhile significant plot points and characterization moments were either glossed over or ignored entirely, so that they're basically kind of one-dimensional to anyone who doesn't already know the characters and their significance. 

That kind of pacing bogged down some of the action scenes too, like when Paul evaded the hunter-seeker. Having him silently stare it down for so long, cutting back and forth between his expressionless face and the faceless drone sucked all the momentum out of the scene. The same goes for the pointless synchronized posing the Atreides guards did on the stairs before getting pincered and wiped out. 

There was so much more that the movie could have done with the screentime, but instead it was just an empty visual prettiness presented in long, slow scenes. I enjoyed immersing myself in the world as a fan of the series, but without that emotional investment I can see how it was just sort of a big empty slog.",qd6vqv
hhn38j7,I agree with the sentiment it was boring. It was beautifully shot but the story wasn't engaging enough. I also thought the characters weren't very memorable either.,qd6vqv
hhoadgf,"It was literally the take of Villeneuve since that's how he made the movie. But hey, I'm sure you know better.",qd6vqv
hhmmk3d,"I didn’t say that I think those things are boring but my point is that this movie needs mainstream appeal. There’s a reason why the Fast and Furious series has 9 movies in it and is still raking in money. I’ll give you a hint, it’s not because of the character development. 

If you were to draw a Venn diagram of blade runner fans and dune fans you’d get a perfect circle. Blade Runner 2049 was a great film, beautifully shot, and it was a flop because mainstream audiences found it boring. If you don’t want Dune to suffer the same fate then you have to make compromises. The core fan base isn’t going to be enough to make this movie a success.

If shallower characters is the price that I have to pay to get part 2 then so be it. This movie isn’t being tailor made for you or for me.",qd6vqv
hhn5464,"Ah yes, Vice, the film that was made with a $60 million budget and did $76.1 million at the box office. The Marriage Story cost $18 million to make and did $2.3 million at the box office. The Post was made with a $50 million budget and did $179.8 million at the box office. Parasite is really the exception here and did $259 million on a $15.5 million budget but much of that was after it had already won an academy award.

The most expensive movie you listed was made on a $60 million budget. Dune, on the other hand, cost $165 million to make. Vice barely broke even and was probably a loss after marketing and other costs are taken into account, although Parasite and The Post the were quite successful Dune will have to do better than either of them in order to be considered a success. You really only proved my point, dude.

Edit: just to give you an actual point of reference for how well Dune needs to do in order to be considered a success, Bladerunner 2049 had a budget of $150-185 million, made $259 million at the box office and was still considered an absolute financial failure.",qd6vqv

Dune **is** a sci-fi book with action in it. Lots of action.

It's called a budget. And in case you don't know this, Dune hasn't done so well in the past, and this isn't a 4-quadrant film either, so it's a financial risk, especially coming out now when we still have COVID concerns.",qd6vqv

But in the 1984 film he was not believable as Ducan Idaho. He was too soft, fat, Ducan might be 'friendly' but he is a killer, you want somebody that is charismatic and believable that they would stab you in the face, mid-conversation and smile.  In the book Ducan was also described as young, athletic and hard muscled with a dancers physique.  In 1984 Jordon didn't really tick any of those boxes.

Patrick Stuart (who was also miscast for this movie as Gurney (seriously book Gurney *is* R. Lee Ermey *in space*)) would have been a better pick for Ducan, he's still miscast, but I believe that Patrick could pull it off.  Where Richard Jordan was just a massive disappointment.

But then again Mamoa has blown me away, no one in has done a better job bringing Duncan to life.   At this point I didn't get enough of him.. Which means I'm looking forward to Dune: Messiah (the third movie; second book).

Momoa is such an example, though my original point about his performance in Thrones is that I personally believe he does have a higher level of potential talent than he routinely displays or is given credit for.

Hollywood is, like any other industry, a political game. What is not said matters as much as what is. Sometimes studios don't try to publicly distance themselves from projects. They just move on.

Only the most literal and agenda-driven commentator could rationalise the absence of Johnson's project as ... a scheduling difficulty.

Oh, and ""Woman of Straw"" was basically Basil Dearden's ""Woman of Straw"" with the addition of 5000 annoying supporting characters, a non-chronological structure, the most asinine social commentary possible and ""ironic"" racism.

In both films, the young male relative (Sean Connery/Chris Evans) of an ageing Machiavellian (Ralph Richardson/Christopher Plummer) tries to frame an immigrant nurse (Gina Lollobrigida/Ana de Armas) for the millionaire's murder. At the midpoint, both the nurse and relative are working together and there is a potential for romance only for the male to be later revealed as a murderer as well as a misogynist. In both films, his crimes are partially uncovered by a member of the house staff and his final breakdown occurs after an interrogation with the cops and the nurse in the house.

Why didn't anyone mention it? Because, to be fair, no one has seen ""Woman of Straw"" in 50 years and Johnson's careful to play down his major influences. ""The Last Jedi"" steals wholesale from ""Battlestar Galactica"" and critics simply ignored the obvious lift because Johnson said SUBVERTING EXPECTATIONS five million times.",qd6vqv

>Paul questioning his role is a central tension that doesn't really seem to be in the new movie.

There are at least 3 scenes where he explicitly does this; first with his father on Caladan, then with his mother after the gom jabbar, and finally in the tent with his mother where he basically says exactly what you just did. 

Beyond that, there are quite a few moments of ""showing"" this conflict rather than ""telling"" it, particularly in his visions.

hitofyr,"> If she thought they were normal dreams then why bring in the box lady after finding out about them?

I didn't say she thought they were normal, just nothing obvious enough to outright make her think that Paul was the kwisatz haderach. You have to remember, that simply being able to tell the future isn't that unusual. In this world, you have Mentats that can calculate things the human mind normally wouldn't be able, you have Bene Gesserit who can control peoples will using their voice, you have space ships controlled by Navigators that have limited foresight so that they don't warp into planets.

What made Paul a suspect to Jessica is that he's an offspring of a Bene Gesserit (which the kwisatz haderach is meant to be) paired with the fact that he was having strange inexplicable dreams. It's explained later why most of his visions never happen and only sometimes come true.

> And why would box lady question his normal dreams?

Because the fact that it sometimes comes true is the key. However, just because he can tell the future isn't the only sign. As mentioned before, plenty (well, not plenty) of people in the universe can foresee the future to a certain extent.

> They clearly didn't think they were normal.

That's why they did the Box test, to further test their suspicions. To the Reverend mother, if he had died, then who cares, he's just an ""animal"". To lady Jessica it pained her to inflict that on to her son, but she's obligated to report about her son to her superiors because he's a Bene Gesserit offspring.

> And to the movie was bashing the viewer over the head with the message ""Hey these aren't normal dreams""

So, the visions he has become more frequent when he lands on Arrakis. This is to support the fact that when Paul is exposed to more of the spice, that is what accelerates and heightens his innate 'powers'. Compare that to the start of the movie where Paul is on Caladan, where there's only traces of spice in the food, and now on Arrakis he is clearly effected by it. So that's why the ""bashing"" of visions occurs. But also, the visions are all slightly different (particularly the one's with Zendaya).",qd6vqv

>!Only problem is, she wasn't supposed to have a child with Duke Leto Atreides.  Not at all.  She was supposed to be married to the Baron Harkonnen and that union would have resulted in a female child with the prophetic powers that Paul now has, the ultimate Bene Gesserit.  Him being a male is a gigantic problem not only for the Bene Gesserit but also the galaxy as a whole because that much power, the power to see the future in the hands of a man will not bring peace to the galaxy but all-out war and yes, later on in the books Paul and his successor clash with the Bene Gesserit!<",qd6vqv

And the Emperor could lend troops(in Harkonnen gear and uniforms) to an all out war on house Atreides. The Dr guy sabotages there planets defenses and Harkonnens with Emperor's guy whip them out.

This is more straightforward, yeah. I would guess the idea is that on Caladan the Atreides are too well-entrenched whereas if you hit them right after relocating their household staff to a new planet where they don't have all of those pre-existing contacts it's easier. But that could stand to be stressed more since as you say otherwise what was the point of all the shenanigans.

It takes multiple books and appendices to really lay out the what and why of spice, and in that way it's not exactly a beautifully laid out narrative.

The information we get in the film is enough to add weight and understanding to the characters decisions. They talk about how it's important to the Guild for travel, they talk about how much money the Harkonnens made from it, they talk about Paul being sensitive to spice hallucinations.

The 'mystery' of spice is central to Paul's ark. I think dumping spice exposition on the viewers early would ultimately lessen the impact of some scenes-to-come in part 2 (and Messiah if we get a trilogy).

I kind of agree that it hurts *this* movie, but I think once we have part 2 it will feel less like a 'hole' and more like a puzzle piece that you don't quite have the shape of yet. Which doesn't exactly make it feel better right now.",qd6vqv
hi1fftt,"That's up to your own willingness to accept the premise that the movie offers. If they say something is true, you can accept it without needing explanation, or you can not.

It's more about the fact that historical portrayals of queer characters typically fell into damaging tropes about gay people being predators, rapists, etc. and infrequently being portrayed in any positive light. There's often a sexual element to queer and queer-coded villains that links queer people to some inherent perversion or social deviance; standouts of Western cinema to me would be Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill and Psycho's Norman Bates. 

A lot of this runs back to religio-dogmatic outcry that there was a ""gay agenda"" enabling gay people to hurt children, bolstered by things like the Catholic Church sex scandals.

I love the detail because, as a book reader, it reinforces the whole theme of the Butlerian Jihad and the hatred towards any AI.

To us, technology represents advancement, catapaulting us into some future existence. To them, so far out, ""technology"" is a kind of ancient foundation like a bronze age, underpinning and facilitating them, but *existence* is the forefront.

So you need to be able to compute the expansion of the universe  and guess that where you're going is still there. Whether you travel or open a gateway the issues are still the same as you could be out by 0.0000001% but on a galactic scale that means you miss the entire solar system you were aiming for, and those Guild Navigators can park straight into orbit.

It's classic power politics in a feudal society. If you're the big cheese, everyone below you is gunning to become the big cheese themselves, but none of them are powerful to do it alone. Unified, they could overthrow you. Apes alone weak, apes together strong.

What made Duke Leto dangerous was two things: one, House Atreides and Duke Leto in particular were especially respected by the other houses, both great and small. People *liked* Leto (something the movie did a lot to illustrate through his honorable actions and even keeled temperament), and they respected House Atreides for reasons going back generations. People might accede to or even support/aid an Atreides seizure of power.

Two, the Atreides had been amassing far more and better troops than any other great house other than the Emperor's Sardaukar (who are one of the most prominent inspirations for 40k's Space Marines) and they were rapidly becoming a genuine threat to the emperor's overwhelming military superiority. Notice how Duncan Idaho kills a ton of Sardaukar totally alone - the Sardaukar are normally so insanely effective as soldiers that just a regiment being deployed on a planet can determine the outcome of a war, and Duncan Idaho just murks a whole bunch of them.

So, Atreides is training super-soldiers and everyone loves them. The emperor knows this and knows he needs to curb or eliminate their power. At the same time, House Harkonnen has held control of Arrakis and its spice (and the absolutely insane revenue that brings in) for 80 years, making them very rich and powerful in the process. The emperor wants to curb their power too. So what does he do?

Use one enemy to crush the other. The Harkonnens commit a surprise act of mass murder with the aid of a few imperial Sardaukar against the Atreides. It's not stated in the movie, but interstellar military campaigns are *really fucking expensive.* This kills two birds with one stone: the Atreides are gone, and the Harkonnens just spent all their money on getting their revenue stream back, not to mention that the infrastructure on Arrakis has to be rebuilt to continue harvesting spice. If the Harkonnens fail (which they didn't, not for a while at least), Atreides is still weakened by the death of Leto, and the Landsraad would have the Harkonnens condemned to obliteration. Win win!

Then Paul survives, becomes the Messiah, and overthrows the emperor by making the Fremen more badass than the Sardaukar. Oops.",qd6vqv

It's been a long time since I read the book, so I'm not sure exactly what happens where. But I thought The Golden Path only showed up after he drinks the Water of Life. And if not, then only showing ""wrong"" visions that can still be interpreted as ""right"" if not taken literally is a terrible way to visualize The Golden Path.

> The voices he hears are his female ancestors helping him sort through his ""memories"" from that potential future for the advice he needs.

Now, I'm pretty damn sure that the Water of Life is what unlocks genetic memory... From both sexes, not just the male line that the female Bene Gesserit can't access. So if that's what's happening, then it's just not how that's supposed to work. All genetic memory should be available to Paul at the same time.

To be fair, I'm trying to resolve what's on screen with what I remember(-ish) from the book.

In the book they do hit someone wearing a shield and the explosion happens letting the reader know what happens which basically has the Sardaukar no longer using their beam weapons on the planet.

There are a few times in the book where they essentially force the hands of their pursuers knowing they can't use their extreme weapons against them because if they are using shields it can destroy way too much around them.

It technically should play a roll in the upcoming battle with Paul retaking the planet, but we'll see if that's included or not. The battles didn't seem to be all that important for the screen writer so only time will tell what Part 2 gives us.",qd6vqv

U might need 4 movies to pull it off which is kind of unheard of for one book. But since it’s technically 3 books in one you could probably split up all the books In dune into two parts .

hht39y5,"Right--technically they're not married (she's Leto's ""concubine"") but she's a de facto partner with all the power of a wife, at least within the Atreides. 

It's been a while since I read the book and I deliberately didn't want to re-read so I could go in fresh for the movie (I think book-to-movie adaptations should be able to ""stand on their own"" both in the sense that they make sense without lots of book knowledge, and that the director should be free to put their mark on the adaptation, like with the Shining or HP movies), but I think Leto deliberately didn't  marry Jessica for political reasons... okay yeah here we go:

>His refusal to marry Jessica was driven by his astute political instincts; he had developed a reputation among the other Great Houses and had become very popular in the Landsraad. While he remained single he ensured that House Atreides was open to political alliance with those other Houses.

hhu4aq6,It's been a while sense I read the book but I feel like Jessica is absolutely overcome with emotion at the end of the Gom Jabbar.  And it's really hard to depict the test on film because it's just a dude with his hand in a box trying to *not* move.  Which is easy for Timothee cus his hand nerves weren't actually being assaulted.  Jessica's emotion gives the scene weight because she knows how scary it is and conveys that to the audience.,qd6vqv
hhs8jgo,"Yeah man.  This was exactly what I meant.  Jessica was seriously my favorite character in the books and to see her kind of diminished to a simpering ball of emotions for most of the movie didn't do her character justice.  

I mean even >!after the Jamison scene, she was like begging for a ship to get them off planet (which doesn't make sense at all because of the nature of the spacing guild). Her character is strong and gets what the missionaria protectiva did to pave the way. She was the one steering Paul. In the movie, Paul is like ""Naw mom chill.  Imma do this desert guy thing now!<. It just diminished a strong feminine character to me.",qd6vqv
hio18uv,Right? This is what I was hoping for with Jessica’s character. I think it also bothers me because it feeds into this whole hysterical woman stereotype.,qd6vqv
hhrzjxw,"The most important moment for this is in the tent with Jessica after the attack. The Duke and, seemingly, house Atreides have fallen. Paul and Jessica are all that remain, with the Harkonnens and the Emperor having ousted them. But what Paul is focused on is a future - his Terrible Purpose. He's seeing visions of him leading Fremen to countless worlds under the Atreides banner and murdering billions - if not trillions - in the name of his father. At their lowest moment, Paul and the story do not care about the possibility of the end of House Atreides but the unstoppable power that the House is to become. It's a contrast that minimizes the importance of what is *currently* happening. Important to this is the fear that Jessica has for Paul in his actions and words - made impactful by how her character has been constructed. To bring it back to the Gom Jobbar, he worries about his humanity in light of these abilities. 

From this point on, Paul does not really care about the Harkonnens. It is this future that is his obsession, and it drives him to understand his prescience and turn the water and all that. And most importantly is that he deathly wants to avoid this future. He is always talking about ""Terrible Purpose"", an unavoidable force driving him - which is only understood through a well-developed Jessica and Bene Gesserit. After he changes the water he says ""I am at the fulcrum. I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without..."" He knows that he must give-in to this fate. After the climax of the action, he forces the Emperor's hand into giving him Irulan after which he knows that the Jihad is inevitable. Even the Reverend Mother does:

> She glimpsed the Jihad and said ""You cannot loose these people upon the universe!"" ""You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardukar!"" Paul snapped.

So within the logic of the first book, Paul becomes a genocidal leader who creates death in the name of his father and all of that. So much he tried to avoid this ""Terrible Purpose"" but he failed. This is not a heroic end, it is tragic. The Harkonnens were never the ""bad guys"", it was the future that came to pass that was the real source of conflict for Paul - the Harkonnens were just a stepping stone. It is Paul's loss to his Terrible Purpose that makes *Dune* more than just another Hero's Journey and is needed to bring it above generic sci-fi. It is this that gives it something to say about the nature of heroes and our obsession with them which is what drives the Jihad that will make us think of the ""gentle ways of the Sardukar"".

Now, as we're speculating on a movie that is not yet green-lit (Dune 2), it is not too farfetched to talk about Messiah since it's in the same place as the second half of the first book in that [Denis wants a trilogy](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/08/denis-villeneuve-dune-trilogy-dune-messiah-1234659470/). The show runner is viewing Paul's story as ending with Messiah, and so we can too.

At the end of *Dune*, as stated above, Paul fails to save his personhood and succumbs to this ""Terrible Purpose"". But this conflict persists into *Messiah*. *Dune* ends with that weird line by Jessica to Chani ""history will call us wives!"" While a little dated, it does demonstrate Paul's lack of commitment to his Terrible Purpose. *Messiah* is driven by this conflict between Paul's personhood, as exemplified by his connection to Chani, and his Terrible Purpose. He cannot have both. This conflict leads to Paul's downfall because he could not do what was needed to pass the Gom Jobbar: Put aside immediate needs/desires for the Terrible Purpose of long-term goals. Paul's story then ends with him failing to fulfill his Terrible Purpose, being a genocidal tyrant, and also not being able to claim his personhood. Paul's story is one of failure and tragedy through-and-through.",qd6vqv

hhnj0p5,"The focal lengths are very different in both movies. Fraser overwhelmingly favors long lenses, Deakins alternates and particularly likes 50mm lenses (EDIT: the 50mm focal length on full-frame is what I actually mean as a ballpark, since a 50mm lens will get longer depending on crop factor. What I meant to say was that Deakins likes mid-to-wide lenses way more than long lenses, and actually a 50mm focal length is a bit too high as an average; it's closer to 40mm in his case). This is true in all of the movies he shot for Villeneuve, and he probably would have found a way to use 50mm (or thereabouts) more often than Fraser did in Dune. I usually like alternation better, but Fraser absolutely rocks the long lens.

The lighting styles are also considerably distinct. They both like soft light, but Deakins tends to favor higher contrast ratios, with a reasonably strong directional light coming from somewhere even in low-light scenes. He makes a scene feel dark without actually making it dark. But Fraser goes *dark*, in a way that most DPs don't dare attempt. The low-light scenes in Dune are astonishingly precise in their exposure and grading. Deakins doesn't usually venture that low. However, the scene between the Baron and Duke Leto really looks like either Deakins or Fraser could have shot it.

They're both amazing DPs, and I still favour Deakins for versatility, but they have distinct styles and to me it feels like Villeneuve contributed greatly but also stayed out of their way. As I said in my previous post, he reminds me of Ridley Scott in that sense.",qd6vqv

If you want to go by that standard, then Dune is a gigantic pile of shit that should not get any sort of critical acclaim (I literally put down God Emperor in disgust by how bad the storytelling got).  But the first book is gold and is a self-contained story, and in that book the Atreides are straightforward good guys, and the Harkonnen straightforward baddies.

IMHO what you're doing is similar to judging LOTR by how convoluted the Silmarillion got.  Not quite the valid comparison.

hhv6101,"I love sci-fi, but I'm told that the book is very dense and difficult to get through, and the movie did nothing to make me think otherwise. I don't think I'd have the patience to read the whole thing. 

Part of the problem is that the movie is deceptive about being part 1. No where in the marketing did they ever indicate that it was only half a story. It's billed as just ""Dune"". 

I honestly think that LotR is the more complicated story between the two. It involves a lot more locations, a lot more history, and a lot more characters that all have long complex relationships with each other. But in my opinion, Peter Jackson did a far better job of making it accessible than Dune did. So much of the context we need for Dune is told in quick, hushed whispers using words that are strange and difficult to understand. I realize that the weird names are not the director's fault, but it's still a problem. 

Too much time was wasted on visions that have no bearing on Part 1 and will only maybe become relevant in Part 2 whenever that is released. It would have been better to use that time to explain the universe a bit better. 

I'm not sure what ""art argument"" you're referring to. I never used the word art in my last message.",qd6vqv

The movie should've been called ""Dune part 1"" in every trailer and ad, because coming in with very little prior knowledge, when I saw that flash at the beginning I wasn't clear if that meant this was one part of a whole, or if the movie was broken into sections (like Inlgourious Basterds).

Plus, even if it's not intended to function as a standalone work, I think the criticism that its boring is still valid. Fellowship of the Ring was one part of a larger whole and doesn't resolve the story, but it's still enjoyable and has an arc of its own.

Dune Part 1 is an arthouse film, where character development is told with eye blinks and head nods, while you are being overloaded with Zimmer's score. The first time I watched it, I liked it.

The other stories deal with his children and the aftermath, similar to something like Star Wars were the original trilogy dealt with the ramifications of Anakin’s story. A trilogy adopting both books into three movies for Paul’s story would be a great beginning if they want to continue the series after. 
They can even just do the two films adapting the first book and leave it there but even Dune as a book ends off in a cliffhanger in sorts. So honestly I think that’s what Villenueve has planned out.

hhlv125,"Only according to Brian Herbert, who made it into the dullest Terminator ripoff crap I've ever read.

Frank left it open and vague and his usage of the term Jihad is quite clever here, because it doesn't always mean a war. From [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad) ""...In an Islamic context, it can refer to almost any effort to make personal and social life conform with God's guidance, such as struggle against one's evil inclinations, proselytizing, or efforts toward the moral betterment of the ummah..."" also ""striving in the path of God (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)"".

With the details left so vague we don't really know much about the event itself, just that mankind chose to throw off machines to avoid being replaced. 

Referring to the Dune wiki, there's some good background for this:

>The name could very easily be a literary allusion to Samuel Butler, whose 1872 novel Erewhon depicted a people who had destroyed machines for fear they would be out-evolved by them.

>From Erewhon, Chapter 9,
""... about four hundred years previously, the state of mechanical knowledge was far beyond our own, and was advancing with prodigious rapidity, until one of the most learned professors of hypothetics wrote an extraordinary book (from which I propose to give extracts later on), proving that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life. So convincing was his reasoning, or unreasoning, to this effect, that he carried the country with him and they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years (which period was arrived at after a series of compromises), and strictly forbade all further improvements and inventions""


So a literal war? I don't think that was Frank's vision.",qd6vqv
hhokda7,"The term ""Jihad"" closely translates to ""Struggle"". So it might've been a religious war or maybe a social movement.",qd6vqv
hhoe540,"That’s a major theme. The Butlerian Jihad was described as being all about freeing humans from machines so that they could reach their full potential, too (the chief commandment of the new religion is, “Thou Shalt Not Disfigure The Soul”), but that leads into a society where humans are bred like cattle and enslaved by the conditioning and drugs needed to turn them into superhumans, not to mention ruled by a brutal and restrictive feudal system.",qd6vqv

And I think you could call them the Butlerian Conflicts or Butlerian Struggles, but they definitely did shy away from the word jihad, which was probably the right move--very different world than when Herbert wrote the books.

I guess my real wish was that they put all the pieces out there for general audiences that no AI has all of these tremendous knock-on effects in the world: no AI means you have mentats, means you need spice for guild navigators, and means that Paul is super dangerous because he's this perfect storm of mentat and Bene Gesserit training.

hhzwpzo,"> But I thought The Golden Path only showed up after he drinks the Water of Life. And if not, then only showing ""wrong"" visions that can still be interpreted as ""right"" if not taken literally is a terrible way to visualize The Golden Path.

He isn't seeing the golden path, just garden variety prescience triggered by the spice. Guild navigators, fremen, Bene Gesserit sisters, etc. all have prescience to varying degrees. Movie Paul is sensitive to spice so just breathing it in is causing his visions.

> Now, I'm pretty damn sure that the Water of Life is what unlocks genetic memory... From both sexes, not just the male line that the female Bene Gesserit can't access. So if that's what's happening, then it's just not how that's supposed to work.

They've changed it for the movie to foreshadow what's coming. Stands to reason that him getting small doses of spice would also let the voices reach him for a brief time as well.. basically follows the rules in the book just fine",qd6vqv
hhvbrzx,Yeah one thing I think that didn't come across in the movie very well is just how good the Atreides and Sardaukar and Fremen are at fighting. Especially the Fremen. They mentioned it all and tried to show it (scene on the stairs) but I'm afraid it didn't fully come through.,qd6vqv

Game of Thrones, for example, was owned by HBO which means they likely own a lot of the merchandising rights affiliated with the show and more.  Even if the shows broke even they would make bank on everything from toy sales to board games and toothpaste.

The upside is if they do make a tv series there could be a bidding war between all the major players (unless the film deal revokes those rights).  I could imagine that Netflix, Amazon and more wouldn’t mind distributing that show if it could draw eyeballs to the service for multiple seasons.

As for Yueh, yes you don't really understand the betrayal, but why he does it does get explained. His betrayal shows the cruelty of the Harkonnen, where they cannot be trusted.  
It is also shown that Yueh essentially knows that but is led in desperation and that's why he gives Leto the false tooth.

Harry Potter, the king of modern YA? Magical boy who survived a spell no one is supposed to be able to, whose parents were super important to the wizarding world.

Ender wasn't just a ""random smart kid"", he was stupidly intelligent to the point that he was always a cut above everyone else, and also lacked a certain level of humanity which would make him the perfect tool.

Get over yourself.

Just because *some* YA material avoids specific tropes, doesn't mean they suddenly aren't tropes of the genre.

This movie was all about a young man having specific plans and destinies thrust upon him, and him deciding what path he wants to take and breaking away from following the specific plans of his parents.

It’s not clear from the original novels whether the Jihad was an actual war against machines, or something more metaphorical like a Luddite movement. (Brian Herbert made it into a war when he took over the series but his work is, let’s say, not the most beloved by Dune fans). Regardless of how it happened, there is now a strong religious taboo against “thinking machines” in their culture. Since then humans have had to take over everything that computers used to do, aided by the enhanced mental abilities that come from eating Spice. Their society has devolved into space feudalism and there hasn’t been major technological progress for thousands of years, outside of some progress in biotechnology. One truly weird example is “chair dogs”, which are living massage chairs.

They use swords because the shields block projectile weapons, so guns are useless. They also have lasers but, like you say, if a laser hits a shield it causes a massive explosion that kills both the target and the shooter, so it’s too dangerous to use them in most combat situations. The shields also block fast attacks from blades, so their swordfighting is a little different from what we’re used to; it’s more about careful, controlled movements than fast slashing.",qd6vqv

That’s all I can infer from your very stupid reply.",qd6vqv

No. You are a clown however.",qd6vqv

Like I already said, every other movie has an ending it doesn’t matter if it’s part 1 of something. This end just stopped. It’s not an ending as many other people have already critiqued this movie about.",qd6vqv

hhmhbme,"""Knives Out"" was basically Basil Dearden's ""Woman of Straw"" with the addition of 5000 annoying supporting characters, a non-chronological structure, the most asinine social commentary possible and ""ironic"" racism.

In both films, the young male relative (Sean Connery/Chris Evans) of an ageing Machiavellian (Ralph Richardson/Christopher Plummer) tries to frame an immigrant nurse (Gina Lollobrigida/Ana de Armas) for the millionaire's murder. At the midpoint, both the nurse and relative are working together and there is a potential for romance only for the male to be later revealed as a murderer as well as a misogynist. In both films, his crimes are partially uncovered by a member of the house staff and his final breakdown occurs after an interrogation with the cops and the nurse in the house.

Why didn't anyone mention it? Because, to be fair, no one has seen ""Woman of Straw"" in 50 years and Johnson's careful to play down his major influences. ""The Last Jedi"" steals wholesale from ""Battlestar Galactica"" and critics simply ignored the obvious lift because Johnson said SUBVERTING EXPECTATIONS five million times.",qd6vqv

hhva3az,"As an aside: I’ve read Dune about 15-16 times. 

It has a lot of stuff but I don’t consider it complicated. Dense yes and can be confusing but it’s not overly complex IMO. 

I think you should try it, if you want. It’s a phenomenal book. It’s my favorite though.",qd6vqv
hhv834w,"The initial comment you replied to of mine was art related, as the comment it replied to implied that art was a certain thing but besides that: 

You say both you fear it’s too complicated for you to read and thus haven’t read it(really silly excuse not to try something btw) and then go on to say you believe LOTR is a more complicated story….

So, forgive me here but which is it? How can a story be less complicated but too complicated? Unless you’re saying you also haven’t read those books. 

I also am unsure how you can comment on stuff you feel is wasted in this movie, visions and what not, when by your own admission you know nothing of the story?",qd6vqv
hhzzx7s,"Paul ideally is the chosen one that will “manipulate space and time” and is meant to “build a new bridge to the future” because the current path humanity is on will lead to destruction. The Bene Gesserit have been marrying into royal blood lines for years to get themselves into position where they are with Paul’s mother being able to borne an heir. But all is not riding on Paul, as the old lady says that if he fails because he has too much of his father in him they have many other alternatives because they’ve been planning this for a long time. 

The mother is loyal most to the Bene Gesserit and is aligned with the ulterior motives that the Bene Gesserit have — which is to get Paul into power (or at least get rid of the emperor and create a new leader) — but their plan did not include the Harkonnen attack and the loss of House Atreides. Instead their plan was to move the family to Arrakis, but conduct the coup on the Emperor instead by having evangelized about a Messiah to the Fremen and putting into place the prophecy. They had put in the work in Arrakis long before the family moved there. From there he is to be their new leader and can stage his attack on the emperor. 

The reverend lady’s deal is that her order is unbiased in their counseling to all the different houses. She is ready to pivot to the Harkonnen’s new plan and sacrifice House Atriedes. That isn’t a worry to her so long as Paul and the mother live because if he truly is the chosen one then he will make do with what has been set up for him and fulfill the prophecy.",qd6vqv

hi769hh,"Im a huge fan of the novels as well. There were scenes I loved: 

The Gom Jabbar

The imperial delegation

The harvester wormsign

The sardaukar on selusa secundus with throat singing dude

Anything involving those sick ass ornithopters

But they messed up a lot. I would say the movie has arthouse aesthetics but definitely not arthouse writing (a lot of it was very, very cheesy) The non verbal communication between Paul and Jessica was hardly subtle and Duncan Idahos scenes were just ridiculous. I also felt that the Sardaukar and Harkonnen were really toned down and didnt feel threatening. The Fremen fedaykin look like power rangers as well lol. 

A lot of it stems from the pacing which avoids a lot of exposition for 2021 audiences ans their tiny attention spans.

They could have fixed a lot of these issues with a HBO R-Rated series imo",qd6vqv

hiumk4g,"The thing this guy is missing, that is laid out in the books, is that the Bene Gesserit plan is for the Kwisatz Haderach to be born in **the next generation**. Jessica was supposed to have a daughter who would marry a Harkkonen, and they would have a son who would be the Kwisatz Haderach. 

Jessica chose to have a son instead due to her love of Leto, who wanted an heir. This threw a wrench in the plan, no one knew whether Paul would be the Kwisatz Haderach or not. So the fact that he was having dreams, AND that he was a boy born only one generation from the planned KH, even if the dreams were not coming true yet it was cause for suspicion.

Jessica wanted her son to have a normal life as the Duke of Caladan, and not be the KH, but once he saw the vision of her with his future sister, it confirmed for her that he was the Kwisatz Haderach that would lead the Bene Gesserit laid plan for intergalatic jihad - she feared he would forever be a pawn, and live an unhappy and fearful life.

The movie really clicked for me when Paul fought Jamis. He was left between choosing the thing his mother feared most, that went against all his father's noble principles (leading a religious crusade, killing billions in the name of his father), or death. This choice was made more powerful by the prominent position of the Atreides signet ring as he is preparing for the fight. Ultimately, he makes the choice to kill Jamis, but his Mother begs for them to return to Caladan though Paul knows it is too late. He made his choice.",qd6vqv

hkihlk3,"Yes, the Feyd mating with Jessica's daughter (presumably a Bene Gesserit sister herself under their control) was supposed to create the Kwisatz Haderach.  Paul came early because of Jessica's love for Leto.

But it's possible Jessica was also under some other compulsion to have Paul.",qd6vqv
hkii1el,"The Bene Gesserits would force that confrontation on her and Paul regardless.  Jessica knew the sisterhood would never allow a son of her genetic line to go untested.  He'd be considered too dangerous to live if he wasn't ""an apparent human.""",qd6vqv
