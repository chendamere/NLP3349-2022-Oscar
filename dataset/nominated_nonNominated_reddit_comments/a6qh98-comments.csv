Officially solidifies Momoa as a great choice for Aquaman after not getting much chance to shine in BVS and Justice League.

ec85ekt,"Positives 

- The core of the movie is heavily inspired from the works of Jeff Parker with the hints of Geoff Johns. I'm a big fan of Jeff Parker's work so it's a big positive in my book. 

- Fantastic visuals and many of the scenes looks like real life painting to me, especially the diving scene with The Trench. Lots of color pallette as well. I was genuinely surprised this movie didn't got an Oscar nomination for VFX. 

- Octupus on drums being hype man for the fight? Asian Jim? OG Mary Poppins as Krathen? Hell yea!

- Those wide angel and tracking shots were stunning. This movie in general had some great action sequences with fluid camera shots which were a delight to watch.

- Score was pretty decent actually (not soundtrack), pretty reminiscent to that of Daft Punk's Tron: Legacy 

- Comic accurate costumes (Take that Bryan Singer)

- Although Black Manta scenes were limited, he was a badass and owned every scene he was in.

- The 3rd act was simply incredible. One of best 3rd act in comic book movie probably.

Negatives

- Simply one of the worst music choices. Ugh, Pitbull doing Africa by Toto. 

- DCEU really need to fix their poor dialogues and writing. Some of the lines were really cheesy and they tried to cram too many storylines and the plot was predictable. 

- If I had a nickle for every time a conversation got interrupted by an explosion.... 

- Orm performance could have been way better without the over the top dialogues. 

&nbsp;

Overall, a really solid family friendly flick with some flaws but offers a great visual experience, action sequences. I would recommend watching this in IMAX or 4DX. ",a6qh98

ecsdi72,"After sitting through *Suicide Squad* on an airplane, my expectations for this movie were really low. But I’ll be damned if it wasn’t a big, stupid CGI carnival ride of fun. 

Yeah, there was your typical origin story exposition, but on steroids. Jason Momoa was beating the shit out of pirates on a submarine within the first 15-20 minutes. 

Really, the only cringe-worthy thing was the fountain sequence in Italy. I was grinning and laughing through the whole movie. DC realized that you can’t do a serious take on a half-breed merman who can control sea creatures with his mind. So they gave us massive CGI battles where merpeople ride seahorses and sharks. And there’s a battle between two characters where an MMA style stat sheet is projected in front of the audience. Few things in this movie are played for drama. 

I unabashedly loved it. But the soundtrack is complete shit. ",a6qh98

eczcc19,"Saw this past week, overall a fun movie but it has a lot of weaknesses. #1 The dialogue was cheesy af, like damn there points were it was approaching AoTc levels of cheese. #2 Aquabro and Black Manta, Aquaman felt less like Aquaman and more like Jason Mamoa, as someone who keeps up with comics it's a bit disappointing. And goddamn was Black Manta's actor overacting, it was too much and combined with his exaggerated facial expressions...ugh. #3 Costume design and CGI, probably just nitpicking here but I really hated how overly bulky the armor was for the Atlantean soldiers and felt that it clashed with the sleeker aesthetic of their vehicles and buildings. Also the CGI was just straight bad in certain scenes. 

But other than those points I enjoyed the movie for what it was. 6/10",a6qh98
ecq4smh,"That was fucking bananas. We've got people talking about becoming the Ocean Master and talking with self-proclaimed ""Fishmen,"" with completely straight faces as our heroes go to the Sahara while Pitbull plays before jumping to Italy and fighting angler fish monsters that lead them to a portal which takes them to the centre of the earth where there are dinosaurs and a giant kraken leviathan voiced by Mary Poppins that helps an army of hermit crab people fight back against the estranged twin of our hero with an army of people riding sharks with laser beams on their heads.

I can't call it good, but man was it entertaining in its excess.",a6qh98
ekcte6q,"The part where they're finding clues to find the trident was very ""National Treasure"" to me",a6qh98
ec9e5g0,"This was really good - they clearly went all out and tried to do something over-the-top and epic in scale. The amount of world-building they try to cram in here feels comparable to epic high fantasy like LOTR. Sometimes it doesn’t work, but it still ended up feeling surprisingly fresh and special. My enthusiasm stems from the sense that real passion went into it. They seemed to be having a ton of fun with this film and worked really hard to make it something great. This could have easily been another half-assed cashgrab and the fact that it wasn’t is pretty damn refreshing. 

\- Incredible action. Great fight choreography use of CGI to create fake long takes (Sicily being the standout here)  
\- Insane visuals, the transitions between the land and sea scenes and the overall style of Atlantis. So good. Overboard use of CGI though, unfortunately. They could have done with a few more real sets.   
\- Amber Heard’s performance is a standout, she really brings a kind of seriousness to her role that’s unusual in this type of film.  
\- When the score is good, it’s great (\*score\*, not soundtrack)  
\- Some great self-awareness and levity. An octopus plays drums. Jellyfish dress. Mera playing the flute on the boat.   
\- Willem Dafoe rides a hammerhead shark   
\- Patrick Wilson didn’t work for his role in my opinion and that was a really big detractor for me. He also had to deal with the bulk of the cheesy dialogue in the script.",a6qh98
ec86w2z,"Seriously blew past my expectations. During the first 10 min I was like yeah it’s no good,  then that Nicole Kidman action scene happened and it never stopped. 

The action sequences on this movie are  truly something else, the camera work is nothing short of exceptional, that post duel chase scene throughout Atlantis with a Blade Runnery track in the background was just glorious.

I was surprised at how solid the ensemble cast was. Patrick Wilson was incredibly and devilishly charming with his smirks. Momoa actually tone down his Momoaism as the movie went by and showed some true sensibility at the end. Dolph was a fucking rockstar that was no pushover and stood up to Orm when necessary. Temuera Morison was the heart and soul of the movie, his scenes with Momoa were pure delights. 
Also can we just appreciate that we have a Hero with Mom and Dad alive and happy Together, I mean wow you don’t see that often.

And that third act... this movie is the  best advocate to CGI and VFX. 

Overall a truly entertaining ride that push the boundaries of blockbusters spectacle.",a6qh98
einc69o,"Okay just watched this movie and I just noticed a serious plothole:

If this film is set after Justice League, why didnt Aquaman just give Superman a call and tell him about the war about to come? As demonstrated in JL, Superman is so grossly overpowered he could probably smash the entire Atlantean fleet if he wanted. Superman coulda just hover above the ocean, declared that hes the protector of the surface, and the movie woulda been over.",a6qh98

ecjws1f,"That was the perfect popcorn movie. Whether or not it was the perfect *Aquaman* movie depends on whether or not you have read the comics and how much you can let a movie slide with its silliness.

This movie is *simple entertainment* at its purest.  It takes the most basic storytelling and amps it up with jaw-dropping visuals. 

I personally hate the Oscars and this movie gives me one more reason to do so. How this movie wasn't nominated for Best Visual Effects is a mystery. Say what you will about the script, but the *visuals* were next level. 

This movie worked on a very elemental level for me. It won't be for everyone. I feel like fans of the character wont exactly be pleased that Aquaman was turned into a meathead ""dude bro"" type. However for what the movie was, I enjoyed the hell out of it.

I had very similar feelings toward Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Like this movie, Batman worked on a Hollywood level. Its script fulfilled all the required beats, especially with its infamous 'bring the villain and hero together on a personal level' angle. Like Aquaman, you can't really use too much brain power with the movie, but it also doesnt insult your intelligence *too much.* 

Any lapse of logic was done for the sake of 'Hollywood' filmmaking. (Like having Batman miss the Joker even when the Batplane was *aimed* at him).

This was a movie saved by its visuals. It *believes* in the universe it created. At a certain point, I couldn't believe what I was watching. It's visually one of the greatest films I've ever watched.

It happens to be matched with a Hollywood-ized script that is *pretty basic.*

It takes elements of Avatar, Black Panther, Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, Thor, Romeo & Juliet and crams it together to make a script that shouldn't work. It gets away with it due to the sheer *audacity* of it. Wan worked on Furious 7, and this movie works on exactly the same level.

My family and I saw it on IMAX 3D. That shit blew our minds. 

Momoa isn't the best actor, but like Dwayne Johnson he's charming and has a real physicality to the role. 

And as a male, there was nothing like staring at Amber Heard/Mera with that sexy red hair and *incredible* body suit.  

Silly, loud, and over the top, Aquaman shouldn't have worked...but somehow it did for me.

On that note, Daddy Manta shouldn't have given his son that knife until he got trapped. Would have made his death scene more emotional if that was the thing he showed him that made him realize it was time to go instead of a bomb.

Also, I just love that the DCEU continues to acknowledge that BvS and Justice League happened, but tries to gaslight you into thinking they happened differently. This is set after Justice League but Arthur hasn't met Mera yet and despite finding out friendship is magic he insists he doesn't play well with others. Also, instead of not being interested in the Surface and only concerned with the Sea, here he's never been to Atlantis and only cares about the Surface. ",a6qh98

""You should save him! I hate you forever now!""

Aquaman just felt cheap to watch. The lighting felt way off on some sets, like the opening fight scene in the house was way too bright which felt unnatural. A lot of stages are way too bright, it feels like a Power Ranger movie. Everyone's skin was airbrushed to the max underwater.

* Arthur learning what happened to his mom was a pretty powerful scene imo
* When Orm breaks his trident, there's a quick take to Arthur and he has just this look of sadness. Loved this moment, conveyed so much with so little, the loss of his mother's trident, losing the challenge, etc
* Mera and Arthur's scene from the desert to the Italy parts were very charming and cute to me. I know not all agree but I legitimately found their romance unobtrusive to the plot and actually felt natural and welcome
* Fight scene in Italy. Damn
* Going into the trench with the flare lights, so beautiful

ednn4ew,"Saw it last night and I'm torn. Overall I'd lean more negative on it but it has its pros and cons.

&#x200B;

Pros:

Momoa is a cool Aquaman, not wimpy.

Blank Manta was cool and well done, but I don't think he should've had to make his entire suit over again.

The above ocean scenes were well done, I think Morrison did a great job as his dad.

Ocean Master looked cool at the very end, but without his mask, I wanted to punch his face the entire time.

&#x200B;

Cons:

Underwater stuff will never look good with CGI, just hard to be believable.

Dafoe's man bun (it just looked so weird)

The music mixing I thought was horrible, specifically when Pitbull's cover of Africa came on. But I felt some scenes had like 3 different soundtracks going from happy to sad to intense, during the same conversation, within like a minute.

A lot of it felt like I was watching a movie from the early 2000s.

Everything just went too well with very little consequence or struggle. It was like here's a challenge...done. No real work put in.

&#x200B;

I think Aquaman 2 would be a hard sell. He's kind of a mix between Black Panther and Thor as far as a tech advanced secret society and kind of like a god, ecxcept he grew up with our customs, so Mera had to be the...fish out of water. (pun intended)

The only DC character that is a regular character is Batman and that's why they've been able to adapt him to screen fairly well over the years. Aquaman and his story are so ridiculous that there's no way around making it seem silly. I almost felt like this movie understood that, but it still comes off as so cheesy because as an audience we want the ""Dark Knights"" and the ""Daredevils"". Aquaman is not gritty.

To make sure they stay in touch with their roots, there could be certain ceremonies each members has to go through. For instance; once you reach adulthood, you are trapped in a container of water. When they are no longer able to hold their breath and starts breathing water, those who appears to be drowning are dragged out and saved. These will never be introduced to their people's secrets. Those who are able to breath water will be accepted into their society and be allowed to take a wife or husband with the same abilities.

While I enjoyed the opening scene at the lighthouse, the movie was really choppy, corny, and cliche up until they arrive at Atlantis.

Ant Man and the Wasp - Hank finding Janet Van Dyne felt very similar to Arthur finding out his mother was alive after years!

Into the Spider Verse - Black Manta's theme reminds me so much of Prowler's theme!!

Thor Ragnarok: Aquaman reminds me a lot of Thor with his humour and a bit of arrogance and going ahead before thinking. Also the beauty and colours in both movies!

Avatar: the battle sequence at the end with the Atlanteans and Crab species (?) battling, plus Aquaman rising and commanding hundreds of sea creatures! Also the sheer beauty and colour of Atlantis

ecdxcwb,"When you adapt comic book to the big screen, mostly you just ADAPT it... There are exceptions obviously, but comic book doesn't translate from page to screen, or so we were told...

And then along came James Wan! What a director! What a movie! This is one of the most accurate comic book movies, like ever(except the lead, who looks nothing like Aquaman from the comics)!

So Jason Momoa is great in this role! No doubt about it! And just like Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder cast people(not very good, in terms of acting abilities), who naturally fit to these characters. I mean from the first shot of him onscreen you're like: he look nothing like Aquaman, I've read, but he IS AQUAMAN!

Back to comics accuracy. Every other character is authentic esthetically, and personalitywise. Black Manta really is Black Manta(they even explain, why his helmet is so damn Big, Oceanmaster has his iconic Helmet and etc... Now the Action! James Wan gives the fight scenes in Aquaman a unique cinematic language: they always begin with wide circular shots, that help establish the geography and after we're used to surroundings, James starts cutting to the choreography. And also long take fight scenes! Quite few of them actually!

Film is pretty fast paced, but still manages to deliver solid story arcs, and clear motivations for both our heroes and our villains. Performances are solid overrall. No clear standouts, at least to me.

I don't even need to say that the movie is visually stunning! You already knew that from the trailers!

The score: pretty good! Aquaman theme is repeated quite often, and after the credits roll, it kinda sticks to your brain on a loop. Character themes overall are very good, although Oceanmaster theme is too dark, considering the fact that he is not evil personally.

ecgiu2a,"This film was pretty well done.  There were a few moments that came off a little weak, but there were also some moments that really dazzled me.  I'm glad that the DC films are finally willing to be colourful and fun.  

The little menacing sting they kept playing after people said 'Ocean Master' was so ham-handed as to be almost laughable.  More subtlety would have been good there.  

Sometimes Heard just hit us with some weird accent out of nowhere.  

The bridge to Atlantis was one of the more stunning locale introduction scenes that I've seen in years.  Somebody went to school on Blade Runner.  

Momoa did a great job of getting across his character to me.  I really bought into him as this big guy that's just never been challenged, and so he just goes around recklessly getting himself into adventures, and sometimes over his head.  At the same time, they gave him a bit of an antiheroic tinge, when he abandons the pirates to their fate, only to have it come back and hurt him.  He did a good job showing me a guy who was trying to make the best of whatever situation he was in, and while he had some good supporting moments in Justice League that were made somewhat lamentable by the fact that Superman made all the other characters seem pointless, I thought that he stepped up in this lead role.  

The way the villain was handled was actually really interesting to me.  I mean, he wasn't exactly wrong, even if he was overreacting and escalating the situation to eleven right off the bat.  He didn't meet his fate in the same way that those sorts of villains normally do, and it's interesting in that the root problem behind the conflict in the movie wasn't really resolved.  

I didn't mind Black Manta as an elite mook.  It's nice that they tied everything together and developed him a bit.  

One thing they could have done is explain earlier how most Atlanteans can't breathe air.  They show us this in the big mid-point fight scene, but by then we're already wondering why everyone is wearing spacesuits.  I mean, they kind of tried by having Nicole Kidman break a guy's armour with her trident and have water come rushing out, but it could have been more explicit.  

Overall, I really liked this movie, and felt it really exceeded my expectations.  It probably would have been better if it had come out prior to Justice League, but then again it probably would have been a worse movie if DC hadn't been humbled.

Me: ""THEY WENT TO SKARTARIS!!!""

It has a fair number of flaws, but that movie was everything I wanted. I had so much fun watching it. The scale, the humour, etc.

But the biggest thing I took away from this film is that it was completely unashamed of what it is and its origins in the comics. There was more comic book reverence in this film than in any, maybe every, MCU film. Like, Black Manta and Ocean Master are comics-accurate in their costumes and are referred to by those names. There is no shame in this film and it is better for it. ",a6qh98
ecprzs4,"The movie had some really stunning visual effects but I really wasn’t into it as I had hoped. 

Negatives:
The cinematic score and song choices they made was really bad and had conflicting tones. 
The costumes (Black Manta and Atlantian Soldiers) looked like they came from the Power Rangers. 
Conversation interrupting explosions. 
Creepy looking age reduction on William Defoe.
The kid who did the training scene with William Defoe was a terrible actor. 
Terrible dialogue for everyone except for Arthur.
Spears made of wine? 

Positives: 
Arthur was written really well.
The trench dive scene was beautifully terrifying.
Creature design.
Visual effects.
Makeup fx.
Cinematography.

The film was wild and entertaining but I felt there were more negatives than positives.

ecltqy4,"It was an entertaining movie, but the story was pretty forgettable.

Of course, some world-building, but it's kinda even harder to swallow then Wakanda, since the Atlantean apparantly can compete with the surface dwellers in size.

There is really a lot of CGI, and while I'd say it is of very good quality, it still can't conceal its artificialness. That mega-kraken-myth creature I still have no idea how it really is supposed to look - I figure there is an actual CGI 3D model that is used in all the scenes showing parts of the monster, but I never really got a feel for it.

A general problem with the action is that you don't really get a good feeling of how strong or tough the characters are, because it's essentially all over the place. There is really no reason for Aquaman to try to barely hold to some edges of a building if he can jump out of a plane without a parachute.

There is a tiny ecological message in it with the Atlanteans throwing our garbage back at us, but I feel it's kinda cheapened because it pretends that there is a way to have that Atlantean tech that is even more powerful than contemporary ""surface dweller"" tech but somehow never caused pollution? (Or is there actually a secret race of magma-dwellers that are pissed off about all the waste the Atlanteans are throwing down into the underwater vulcans?)",a6qh98
ecssae2,"I know this movie wasn’t perfect, but I really think it deserves a better score. They really leaned into the pure zaniness of Aquaman and did a really great job.

Felt like they tried to hard to insert random humor and charm into the movie and it ended up just taking me out of the immersion.

This doesn't mean that I don't like the movie, it's just bloated with clashing gases of character development and world building, but it some how gets by with the amount of enthusiasm and energy it projects through the action scenes and the colourful world building we see.

I have some minor but genuine questions.  These things didn't take away from my enjoyment.

*Is it convenient for Mera to be handed Pinocchio by the fountain?*  It was the surface-world book that was referenced to her during the harrowing escape.  Couldn't she have come across it in a bookstore instead of it just being handed to her?  We see her exploring the surface-world.

*How long was Black Manta tinkering with his armor?  Did it occur during the same timeframe that Arthur and Mera were traveling from the desert to Sicily?*  This is what I am telling myself.  I understand that Manta is probably some sort of technical genius which is what makes him so good at piracy.  My personal experience tells me that research and engineering take time especially when it is just one man. Not only does Manta have to understand the workings of the Atlantean technology but he has to alter and integrate it for his new helmet.  Tony Stark had a lab, Jarvis, and robot helpers.",a6qh98

ed1rjr8,"SPOILERS

I didn’t mind this film. I thought it was fun and colourful and visually pleasing. But it couldn’t decide what kind of film it wanted to be and also in my opinion missed out on a lot of golden opportunities. 6.5/10. Could have easily been 9/10.

In terms of the tone of the film, I just think it was caught in between trying to be like Thor:Ragnarok in terms of wonderful and fun and funny, and like a serious return of the king film. It never quite found its footing because it would go from over the top and funny (opening sequence) to very serious all of a sudden (submarine shooting scene), and so that’s why people didn’t appreciate the light hearted parts, as they came off as accidental. Also, throughout I was thinking, you can have a great film that funny and really emotionally strong as well, but here it for some reason misses out. Part of the problem I think is continuity, like showing all training in bits of flashback, rather than building the character of Arthur and his dad through a series of scenes-which I thought was done really well in Man of Steel.
So instead of fun and emotional, it’s just fun and serious, like you’re watching two different films. I think part of it also is score. It felt clunky at times, especially thinking about the start of the film where he’s going through this ship comically while this “epic” music is constantly shifting from too loud to too quiet, which summed up much of the film in my mind which is that it didn’t really build on itself.

Secondly, like in Justice League, this film was still trying to do WAY too much. For example I loved black manta, but why couldn’t they have just set up his story for a sequel, rather than give him a thirty second scene in which to build his suit, and then use him as just another lackey?
Also a major gripe of mine was that there was this beautiful place of Atlantis which the film could have really explored and delved into, but instead we were forced on a whistle stop tour of the ocean, having bundles of CGI thrown at us every step of the way. I’m sorry to keep comparing it to Marvel, but it’s like going to all of Thors nine realms rather than building up a connection with a place. Definitely keep Mera and AC going to the surface like they do, allowing for her to complete her character arc, paving the way for Arthur to complete his, but the simplest way to fix this would be a return to Atlantis at the end and having Atlan’s tomb hidden somewhere there.

Much of my annoyance at the film was the way they chose to finish it. A CGI mosh pit in the middle of a random place with virtually 0 stakes. Also can we consider the fact that Arthur kills a heck ton of Atlantians in the final battle, and no one cares, they just cheer him on after he kills their king, who they’ve actually only shown loyalty to for the whole of the film. I think the film would feel so much more compete if the final showdown happened in Atlantis, with the help of actual Atlantians like in Black Panther (but revered) in order to seem like a more genuine people’s revolution rather than a deposition. This would solve the problem discussed earlier and also, if the final showdown happened between an injured Arthur, but with trident, it would really feel like more of an accomplishment. Also it were in front of all the people it would mirror his initial failure and show his complete hero’s journey, also at the same time fulfilling Mera’s quote that he’s not just a king but a hero. 

I just think with a couple changes to storyline, it could have been a really good film. My timeline for the film would look like this.

Mother and father meeting> mother explaining to son and us about what Atlantis is etc.>mother taken>cut to Arthur wandering around occasionally saving people alongside building his training and father relationship in flashbacks>stumbles upon pirates>the submarine causes start of war> meera come to surface just in time for tidal wave to destroy home as well as almost kill father> AC reluctantly goes to Atlantis> meets with families opposed to oceanmaster> coaxed into battle and loses>normal Sahara story>Sicily shows trident in Atlantis all along> civil war started in Atlantis to get AC through the city walls and find the trident> undergoes multiple injuries from orm before getting the trident in some kind of hidden vault> mother in vault the whole time> sword in the stone moment> finally embraces who he is> everyone stops fighting to watch orm and injured AC face off> Arthur wins> spares orm> those who supported orm eventually accept Arthur as king> AC and mom and Mera return to rebuild lighthouse> Mera and AC share a kiss on the pier

I just think this sequencing would allow for not emotional attachment and a more complete story arc, as well as eliminating lots of the stupidities of the final fight scene.

Ragnarok: what is supposed to be a very dark comic book story which is the end of Asgard gets turned into a fun comedy superhero goofy movie...crtics: omg best marvel movie since the marvel movie before it, mcu takes risks so orignal great good job 

Aquaman: also a goofy movie about a guy who can talk to fish (I mean what else can you except looking at the concept) that takes us underwater where we have NEVER been before, with absolutely stunning visuals...critics: no good, too goofy, too much water, DC trying too hard.

I saw critics critize Aquaman as too silly and over the top because an octopus was playing the drums yet same critics gave ant man & wasp a stellar review (an ant plays the drums in that movie)

I mean cmon now can DC ever win? Why are their movies held to such high standards when Marvel movies get a pass

ecak28x,"The music in the transition scenes was so jarring? how did so many people let those songs in the movie without realizing how weird and immersion breaking it was? semi decent soundtrack run of the mill dramatic movie soundtrack for an extended period of time...and then Pitbull? The fact that any franchise (besides maybe Fast and Furious or some C grade CGI kids movie) thinks they can get away with a Pitbull song in their movie is absurd to me.

&#x200B;

Aside from that, solid film\*\*.

&#x200B;

\*\*I decided early on that i would approach this movie like a decades old action movie where you don't even attempt to take it seriously and instead just sit back and enjoy the action scenes and the absurdly corny dialogue. I feel like I enjoyed it a lot more because of this perspective. The fights were undeniably lit. The corny dialogue and elementary plotline became endearing after a while. Jason Mamoa exudes manliness. I wasn't sold on Amber Heard's character at first, but she grew on me. Mera is somewhat charming in a silly way. I'm glad DC stopped trying to take themselves so seriously, I feel like they'll be better off for it. Just keep things simple and lighthearted and maybe we can salvage this franchise. It's probably the only option at this point.

&#x200B;

I expect that this movie will get torn to shreds, and I don't really care to defend it (if you approach it as a movie that's actually supposed to have some substance or any semblance of tactful/creative storytelling, then it is undeniably a failed movie). BUT, drunk surfer dude Arthur is an incredibly entertaining and fun character, that's the one credit that I feel this movie undeniably deserves. Great move on DC's part to take take some liberties with such a classic character.

&#x200B;

Side note: Damn they really went out of their way to shoehorn Black Manta in there. I can imagine that quite a few non comic book reading viewers were confused as to why they made his character seem so important, only to discard him later.

Side side note:  There are actually three other credits that I feel this move undeniably deserves:

1. The action scenes were undeniably hype af. The ring of fire was lit (Atlanteans audience reactions were lowkey funny). Arthur showing up riding the fucking Kraken was lit. The introductory fight scene in the submarine was cool.
2. Some of the shots (are they still called ""shots"" if it's all CGI) and scenes were visually spectacular. Literally unlike anything I've seen in any other movie. The final battle was lit. The scene where they're swimming away from those water monster thingies while holding the flare, just so beautiful and eerie (lack of sound was a good touch). There are others that I can't remember off the top of my head. If anything, this movie was nice to look at (especially in 3D).
3. With the amount of worldbuilding they had to do in one film, they could've handled it a lot worse. Granted, I haven't seen Justice League yet so I don't know how much of it was already pre-established. I also don't know how exactly much was original and how much was carbon copied from the comics. As a casual comic book reader, I thought the backstory of Atlantis was cool and new (assuming it's actually new).

I guess ""not having absurdly bad worldbuilding"" isn't really a merit, now that I think about it.

edm0pp6,"This movie was so good I forgot it was DC, it felt like a good marvel movie, which in turn means it felt like a real proper movie and not some niche.
The visuals and lore felt like a nice mix of Dark Souls and God of War, the first king being trapped in the Abyss was some Arthorias stuff. The third act is actually better than the Infinity War war, which still wins due to Thanos but the war itself was miles more epic here. 

But the visuals... Seriously can any other movie claim to look more epic? Maybe ready player one? That massive war full of technicolor beasts was a better star wars film than any real star wars one. And Aquaman was pure hype. Honestly this is one joyful film. Also I did like the Manta Suit montage, I was smiling seeing him all pro with the modern song, I think the intent was to see him have fun and become sympathetic, people are missing that here.

I got a hint of Tron Legacy with some of the musical scores. James Wan and his horror background really showed in this movie with certain sequences. Black Manta was awesome, I just wish his arch didn't end so soon, but by the looks of it, will definitely be getting more of him in a future film? (stick around for the credits people, worth it). I enjoyed Amber Heard as Mera more in this film then in Justice League, but that's also because she had a vastly bigger role and we were able to get from her character and acting ability. I know people will knock the movie for some of the goofy names and such, but I think DC nailed it out of the park with Aquaman, I loved 'Ocean Master' and just the campiness of it all...it was so great, I walked out of the theatre with my friends during the early showing of it (using the Amazon Atom tickets promo) and it was such a sight to see people come out of the theatre with a smile and enthusiastic response to it, I had way too much fun with that movie.

- Atlantis was really pretty
- Jason Mamoa is charismatic as fuck
- The feral trench fish people design was awesome
- I guess its cool that Dolph Lundgren was in it?
- The original soundtrack was pretty cool

What didn't work:

- The plot felt like a very paint by numbers Heroes Journey. Not that there is anything necessarily wrong with that, but it wasn't a particularly interesting execution
- Both villains were super generic
- There were moments when the fight scene choregoraphy / camera movement looked too fake and momentarily broke my immersion
- The performances outside of Jason Mamoa were pretty medicore. The two villains (especially Black Manta) were particularly terrible... but a big part of that might just be the material they had to work with.
- BlackManta was completely shoehorned in, had no bearing on the story except for to provide an extra action set-piece (that really had no bearing on anything)
- Willem Dafoe was completely wasted. Oceanmaster suddenly turning on him and saying he knew he was helping Aquaman all along felt like the writers just needed an excuse to write him out of scenes because he had nothing to do. Why would Oceanmaster wait until then?
- The dialogue was really bad. Lines were clunky. Jokes fell flat.
- Despite sounding good on its own, the score's use of the three note progression to highlight dramatic moments for the villains came off a little cartoonish

ecx5efv,"I kinda have an unfair predjudice against DC, or it's more like I have lower expectations but I was pleasantly surprised with this one. While it didn't leave me eager to have a sequel, I did enjoy what this movie had to offer standalone. The cinematography is definitely the strong point and also the choreography of the action/fight scenes. The script kinda felt lackluster and the first part had moments where I felt the dialogue just felt unnatural but that seemed to improve as the movie went on. I guess I'm in the minority on this one but I didn't like Black Manta . it seemed like it was just more set up for the sequel where he will be the main villain but I think his role in this movie was super weak. To me the costume is super silly looking but that's probably how it looks in the comics so can't really complain too much there. 

Anyway final thoughts. The part where Aquaman's brother said something like ""don't call me king, call me Ocean Master"" cracked me up.

ec9bi74,"Aquaman isn’t an awful movie, however, l thought it was average at best. There were aspects I enjoyed, but it was a pretty generic superhero movie. Don’t get me wrong I love a dumb action romp as much as the next guy, but I have seen everything in this movie done before in more interesting, diverse ways so I was just left bored. It had several different elements at play that I don’t feel they successfully fleshed out or capitalized on. 

Atlantis felt like a giant set piece rather than an actual kingdom. We spent no time there and I had no concept of it as an actual place. What was living in Atlantis actually like? The world building for a place that was supposed to be the whole epicenter of the film was very poor.  They didn’t make Atlantis feel worth fighting for. 

Arthur was Anti-Atlantis for obvious reasons, and part of his arc was learning that it wasn’t all bad. Except, why wasn’t it all bad exactly? It was implicitly interwoven throughout that Atlantean society is very traditional, classist and ruthless. That’s not necessarily a bad thing when we’re just starting out, however, if Arthur is supposed to be finding the good in Atlantis despite all of the supposed tyranny then I needed to see some /actual/ good. There was a whole scene where Mera saw that the surface had some things to offer, yet Arthur didn’t get anything similar to that. Without Atlantis being given any time to be truly introduced Arthur’s victory felt hollow. What is he really going to be ruling over? How is his leadership going to be changing anything in Atlantean society? It was basically just  ‘well, I mean Mera’s cool and I’m the true king so I guess Atlantis is fine now’. 

Related to all of that, what was the problem with Orm being king? Other than the whole ‘he’s not the chosen one’ thing. The people seemed perfectly happy with him.  What was the problem other than the not totally irrational war with the surface world? The war was an issue only because we are set up narrative wise to root for Aquaman as our protagonist. Random War is never okay, but Orm made some good points as to why he was invading. There were no protests or rioting. No food shortages. No sense of economic disparity. No sense of oppression. There was nothing establishing Orm as a bad king before this movie and nothing really stood out to make him a bad king during the events of the movie. Yes, the war was unnecessarily and he seemed to rule with an iron fist, but I didn’t get the feeling that anyone outside of the inner circle had a problem with that. And his sympathetic reasoning (I.e the surface routinely screws with the Ocean)  did not help solidify him as a villain to me. I was only really against him way late in the movie when he killed the King of the Fishermans to force them onto his side. 

And now smaller issues, this movie was way too long. There were long stretches of time when nothing in particular was happening and the awkward dialogue definitely did not help. It felt like it was trying to be Thor: Ragnorak, and only succeeded in being Thor. Black Manta was completely unnecessary. He added nothing to the narrative and didn’t appear for most of the movie anyways. Should have saved him for the sequel and just teased him at the end. It was super obvious his Mother wasn’t dead, but how did she not die exactly? She didn’t have a flare like Aquaman and Mera did, so I’m too believe she just beat thousands of those things off entirely alone in the dark in their own territory? 

I do like Jason Momoa for Aquaman. I think he was a great choice and this is a good interpretation of the character. I loved the fight choreography. I thought it was very realistic and had real weight to it. Especially compared to Black Panther, which was almost the same movie just done a lot better. 

TLDR; Aquaman is a basic superhero movie, but it was way too long, Black Manta was shoehorned in, the dialogue super forced, and it only halfway made sense. ",a6qh98

ecn5pca,"Overall, I thought it was fun - it was cheesy as hell, but with a concept like aquaman, it's hard to take it all too seriously and I was glad to see them embrace it.  Some of the underwater scenes gave me avatar vibes mixed with TRON: Legacy (probably the score and the aesthetic), and a lot of it was visually really awesome.

The plot wasn't too memorable though, and I have a hard time recalling a lot of the details.  Ultimately, it seemed like they wanted you to remember the ""big moments"" and the spectacle more than the story so I guess that's fine.

The only thing that *really* bothered me during the movie was the physics of the humans when they were underwater.  I don't know if was supposed to add to the whole cheesiness of the movie (similar to the octopus playing drums) but the way they were suspended and pretending to move freely in water looked really awkward and it came across as unintentionally funny to me at times - especially during the first meeting between King Orm and Nereus.

But besides that, the fight scenes were definitely the highlight of the film for me - the one-shot scene in the beginning with Arthur's mother and the scene in Italy stood out to me as pretty great. 

Definitely one of the better DCEU movies, and though it came across as too wishy-washy at times with the lightheartedness and humor (especially during most of the scenes in the desert), I enjoyed the movie.",a6qh98

The plot was straight forward enough, they just picked a bunch of things straight from the n52 run which I appreciated cause that run was badass and was what introduced me to the character.

eff3j2o,"My major qualm ahead of seeing this movie was that it might be too big of an undertaking for James Wan. Having just watched it, I was right. The acting was bad (any scene with Black Manta, teenage Arthur). Casting was bad (Dolph Lundgren and Patrick Stewart). Makeup was bad (black eyebrows on redheaded Mera, young Tom Curry's hair). Poor writing (Aquaman and Mera kiss on the battlefield). Poor music (from Pitbull to Roy Orbison to what sounded like music from the two most recent Deus Ex video games).

The script was too disjointed. Was this movie gonna be like National Treasure? A romantic comedy? Wrath of the Titans? Jurassic World? There's what this movie could've been and then there's what it is. The only saving grace was the visuals but that's not enough to save a bad movie. I don't care how much money it made. To me, it's a bad movie. I was ready to stop watching after 15 minutes but stuck it out to the end. This thing was ultra-predictable Hollywood fare. I was extremely disappointed. I give it 5 out of 10 stars.

Quite honestly, with a different tone, a more focused script, and better direction, I would've preferred a three and a half hour movie. That's what it should've been if it was better produced. This is a typical popcorn movie. Poorly done like most movies in theaters. As long as people keep supporting this kind of crap, this is what we'll keep getting.

• Aquaman was a lot more likable in Justice League than he was in this. 

• I was getting Phantom Menace vibes when Dafoe and Lundgren (don’t remember their names) we’re discussing alliances and uniting people with Orm. Just a lot of names and different seas (groups? tribes?) being thrown at you that you don’t really care about. 

• Not to mention that the movie goes on way too long.

His character arc was a lil wack before this movie and i retroactively dislike snyder for that...

The visuals were awesome! Felt like watching avatar cross black panther cross justice league with the best aspects from all 3!

Also. BLACK MANTA!!!! I loved him as a villain a bit more the Oceanmaster tbh because I liked the way he was turned from regular villain into a super villain by the indifference of a hero! Great character development for both of them!

Also the dude that plays OM was great but looks *sooo* much like the dude that plays the Reverse Flash, so I was pretty scared of him.

BUT it has fantastic graphics, aesthetics, and effects, the best parts are when they dive into the trench with the flare,  and the end setpiece with god knows how many different creatures, armies and vehicles.   and i sort of scoffed it at the start but the subplot of his mom and dad ended up being more touching than i expected and paid off  by the end

side note: a minigame i like to play when watching recent movies is to try to pick out the pro-china angles, as is common in modern hollywood movies.  and try as i might,  i cant see it here.  maybe if i stretch hard enough i could say that china wasnt one of the countries that had trash thrown back at them?   in other movies its not so difficult (lul mortal engines - past this huge wall theres a healthy green utopia to the east  while shitty euroland on the west is barren)",a6qh98

ecat8it,"There's something to be said about a movie that not only acknowledges the absurdity of its premise but truly embraces and owns it. Aquaman is such a film. The (boring) hero powers... the fantasy/sci-fi pastiche... the earnest acting... the cheesy action-movie one liners... the arrow-straight plot... none of its individual parts would likely stand on their own. But mixed together, they form a delightful, action-packed fantasy romp that makes this viewer almost want to rewatch Justice League.

Aquaman has always stood to the side of the other core members of the Justice League as the weirder, less-cool Hero. He swims fast and talks to fish! The powers are uninteresting, and so everything has to be pulled from the characterization of the hero. Thankfully, Jason Momoa's screen presence is as big as his muscles. He reminds me of Chris Hemworth's appearance in the first Thor--unpolished but brimming with charisma.

The supporting cast is equally strong. Amber Heard makes a wonderful deuteragonist as the fiery, independent Mera, and she has plenty of chemistry with Momoa. Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II give earnest energy to their cardboard villains. Willem Defoe, Dolph Lundgren, and Nicole Kidman round out the supporting cast with performances filled with sincerity that the script doesn't earn on its own.

Aquaman isn't flawless. It suffers from many of the typical pitfalls of an origin superhero film: a slow start and cardboard villains. There's a great deal of world building that has to be slogged through, but once those pieces are mostly finished, the film takes off and never stops. The pacing of the film covers for the straight forward plot and the cast rounds out the edges of some of the sillier moments.

Much of the credit must be given to James Wan's vision of the alien, underwater world that the film mostly takes place in. Unlike the Superman films of the DC Cinematic Universe, James Wan fills Aquaman with a rainbow of colors and gorgeous CGI scenery. Gorgeous CGI mayhem is somewhat expected at this point in super hero films, but Aquaman doesn't disappoint and raises the bar at many times throughout. The action scenes are exciting and well-choreographed.

Aquaman is great fun. Anyone who enjoys the super hero genre (or shirtless Jason Momoa) should see this one on the big screen.

Unfortunately, I still have a little hope with Shazam, as trailers does make it look quite fun. However, for now it's MOS which is my favourite even with all it's flaws, then WW, heck even SS was a little fun, but that may be cause I'm fan of Will Smith.

The action scenes and visuals we're good at times, but jesus you can make a cheesy film and still maintain good filmmaking. 
For example Clerks, Princess Bride, Thor Ragnarok, and Ant-Man.

Personally it was a bad FILM in terms of the art form but I understand the Fast and Furious like appeal of this movie despite my dislike of it.  Similar to me finding The Witch to be great while others think it's trash.

Although they, again, resolve their differences over their mother, it actually makes sense this time because the movie spends time setting it up.

Likes:

* The story and how they told us Aquaman’s origin with his parents
* World building with Atlantis and the different underwater kingdoms
* Visuals were beautiful coupled along with the musical score (some songs did feel out of place though)
* Fights were top-notch and the last underwater battle was simply a work of art. I don’t think they could have done it any better.
* King Orm was pretty good as a villain and you can at least understand why he hated Aquaman and the surface world

Dislikes:

* “Aquabro” just doesn’t do it for me. It was really hard for me to take him seriously.
* Cringey dialogue and jokes that didn’t land. That dessert scene felt like it was ripped straight from a bad sitcom.
* A couple of scenes with way too many lights. The entire sequence when Aquaman and Mera were being separated was awful on the eyes.
* The scavenger hunt subplot felt weird and seemed like they were just there to fill up screentime. The scenes on land were a waste when that time could have been used to explore more of the underwater world.
* Black Manta was terribly used. They should have just saved him for the mid-credits scene and kept it as a surprise reveal. Was sadly disappointed.
* I was also hoping for a more climactic finale. Would have been awesome if King Orm created an even larger tsunami than the one he made in the beginning of the film and Aquaman had to find a way to stop it. Unfortunately we just got another plain fight scene.

There were tons of moments where you could take the frame and get a painting, though DC is consistent at that,even BvS was filled with those. 

I liked music choices. They improved the effect of the scenes. Only Africa was different in this but it was fun. 

Aside from too many cheesy lines (which I also didn't mind) it was the perfect movie imo.

ec8jz5w,"**Came in expecting a 7/10 and my expectations were met.**

**Pros:**

*1) Visuals/CGI*

At LEAST A 9/10 and done by the AMAZING Industrial Light & Magic Company (credited for Infinity War, Last Jedi, Ready Player One) and other visual effects companies, who deserve AT LEAST an Oscar nom for their work. (Seriously, future DC Films should continue using the same teams for their VFX!) I would even argue Aquaman as being the most beautiful and eye-pleasing DC Film currently. Atlantis/sea kingdoms are amazing, the costumes (specifically Ocean Master and Aquaman) are ON POINT, sea creatures are monstrous, intimidating, and badass, and the art direction by James Wan shines across the screen. Dude knows how to use his imagination.

*2) Arthur*

Jason Momoa proves he can lead a film. He's charismatic, chill, and sets off good vibe in his screen presence. More than capable of portraying a multidimensional character you want to relate and root for, than just your buff surfer metahuman dude with one-liners.

*3) King Orm*

Many people disliked King Orm's performance due to being cringy/cheesy, but I give him a pass and say his performance showed that he tried to make the best out of what was given to him. Patrick Wilson proves he has the acting chops and physicality to pull off a menacing rational dude. Yes, he does speak in a monologued verbatim, but thats what we expected from Ocean Master right?

*4) Motivation*

Plot is straightforward and antagonist's reasons of conflict are easy to follow. Especially liked how they showed King Orm's frustration/hostiliy against the land dwellers by throwing back pollution/trash from the sea.

&#x200B;

**Cons:**

*1) Film Runtime*

Film sacrifices most of its time for the exposition and whole journey/quest plot of finding the lost trident. Lots of pacing/direction issues and tonal shifts that caught me off guard. The movie does feel like it gets lost somewhere between its comedic and light-hearted elements, some of which are not well-executed.

*2) Black Manta*

Black Manta's one-dimensional role as King Orm's hired assassin really doesn't contribute to the overall plot and doesn't do him justice as the menacing threat that he is. Yes, he does put up a great fight, but his presence felt more like a service to the fans. Aside from showing his father's death, I really wished they would have saved Black Manta's full appearance for the sequel, and instead use that screentime to flesh out Arthur and Mera's character as they continued on their journey.

*3) Lack of character development.*

Arthur and Mera's chemistry felt stoic and awkward at times. Didn't feel any connection between the two and the final kiss they had during the fight didn't make it any better. There was no real human element to their interaction and ultimately it felt like their surroundings sort of overshadowed any room for human growth.

*4) Lack of urgency/risk*

My biggest gripe with this film was that it felt like there were no real costs at stake. I was actually surprised and disappointed to see the reveal of Queen Atlanna being alive this entire time. Her intervention in the final fight against Arthur and his brother really underwhelmed me because Ocean Master goes from being the evil brother who wants Aquaman to kill him in defeat (which I really liked because it was fitting) to being a sorry loser once he sees his long lost mother. Her being alive ultimately nullfies the villian Ocean Master really is and sort of releases the tension/hostility between Ocean Master and Aquaman, which to me, felt like a cop out to Ocean Master's character.

*5) Other*

Another thing I noticed throughout the film was how Vulko and Queen Atlanna had some really unnecessary screentime. There were certain epic ""King Arthur"" scenes that were immediately followed by a camera pan back to Queen Atlanna or Vulko's reactions while speaking some cringey dialogue. Like, why? Just focus on that particular scene and keep it there. Or else it distracts the audience and ruins whatever vibe the audience is feeling. (ex. Aquaman using his trident to funnel that water shield against Ocean Master and then panning to Vulko). Kinda threw me off.

&#x200B;

**Overall, I think James Wan plays it ""safe"" with Aquaman with his archetypal and formulaic story that is nothing new. Yes, the world building and action sequences are spectacular, but I wished they had put more effort in their storytelling and attention to Arthur, than to the grandeur of Atlantis and what the ocean has to offer.  There are some 10/10 moments that make you want shiver, or be in awe and there are some 2/10 moments that make you want to shrink, or roll your eyes.**",a6qh98
ed7r0f1,"I tried to give this movie a chance but once again DC just disappoints me.

&#x200B;

There are some things I like, for example the action is well choreographed and the CGI is really impressive, with Atlantis and the monsters (especially the Kraken) looking amazing. The scene with the savage fish-men was so good it seemed from a different movie.

&#x200B;

Other than that, this movie suffers some pretty heavy blows in the writing department. Tonally, it's all over the place: it's a story that tries to be about sibling rivalry, war, ocean pollution, revenge, past mistakes, adventure, etc. and because of this none of these elements are given the proper attention and the movie feels too crowded. The jokes are the classic forced superhero movie quips and not only are they not funny at all, they completely ruin the tone of serious scenes and they do this constantly. The plot has too many cliches: I'm all for repurposing classic tropes but after a certain point I could guess what was going to happen with minutes in advance. The characters are all very bland (so much for making King Orm a relatable villain DC) and dear god what did they do with Black Manta? He shows up for so little and leaves absolutely zero impact despite them going through the efforts of that emotional opening scene and his fantastic suit! Not even Aquaman cares that much, he just says ""Oh I shouldn't kill my enemies whoopsie"" and then goes to murder hundreds in a war like nothing happened.",a6qh98

I'll just break down my pros and cons. 

Pros 

The Visuals. Absolutely incredible.  Nothing really more to say there. 

The action was really incredible and easy to follow considering the sheer amount of insanity going on most of the time. 

Amber Heard and Jason Mamoa while not super strong actors they still hold together the movie with their charisma. 

Patrick Wilson was pretty hammy solid as Orm. 

Drumming octopus. 

Cons

The score and music selections. Absolutely god awful.  The score made me physically cringe at some moments. The pop tunes chosen were more out of place than the ones in Suicide Squad. That Pitbull song and moment? What the fuck was that??

The tone overall. It was too cheesy for my taste and felt like it was trying to be Thor Ragnarok yet an epic origin story at the same time. It didn't work for me and left me feeling sour on the movie overall after one viewing so far. 

The dialogue was Star Wars prequel level bad during some moments. 

The humor.  90 percent of the jokes fell way flat for me. Once again the movie thought it was Thor Ragnarok and it just wasnt working. 

The guy who played Black Manta isn't very good IMO. He comes off way too try hard and his facial reactions are laughable. ""Damn you!"" L O L

Overall I'm bordering on just saying it was okay but I feel that most of my negative feelings are just how caught off guard I was at the pure insanisty and cheese on screen. 

I'm seeing it again Sunday so I'll go in expecting B movie chesse with billion dollar visuals and maybe I'll enjoy it more.

I did enjoy the kingdom of the trench and kingdom of the fisherman but i wished for more lore behind these 7 kingdoms.  Also liked the big war scene at the end, CGI was well done.

I feel like it's *long* past time for Nicole Kidman to try to stop smoothing out her features. She looks like a plastic person. That aside, I liked her chemistry with Jango too.

I genuinely don't understand the appeal of Amber Heard. Her hair looked silly...perhaps they made it that strong of a color because she would have looked too much like Black Widow? Design-wise, that stuck out like a sore thumb. 

And Dolph? I mean, it's Dolph. That dude can show up wherever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.

ec95e3b,"I really had fun with this movie. Is it an amazing film that we'll be talking about for generations to come? No, but I'm not really sure it was supposed to be. It was a lot of fun and I left the theater really excited for whatever comes next in the DCEU. Hopefully Wan stays on and does Aquaman 2.

The movie definitely wasn't perfect. There was a lot of really terrible dialogue. Willem Defoe (while fantastic as always) was an exposition machine, and that got a little tiring. There was definitely too much lore and I wouldn't have minded them saving the Trench for another movie, just because it felt like they were padding the runtime with their inclusion (which is insane, considering the 2.5 hour runtime). 

Black Manta felt rushed and then dropped. I'm not sure why they crammed his entire story arc into the first half hour if they weren't going to use him in the second half of the movie. If they had taken their time with him and had his father killed closer to the middle of the film, I feel like his transformation to Black Manta would have been more impactful. That said, I thought the actor who played him was sooo hammy and pretty awful at times. 

On the topic of bad acting, Momoa was okay, but Heard was pretty stiff and melodramatic in a lot of scenes. I thought they had good chemistry, but they both felt like they were *actively acting,* the kind of thing you see in a high school play, not a Hollywood blockbuster. Dolph Lundgren was a strange choice and after seeing the movie, I don't really know what the point in casting him was. Willem Defoe is a national treasure and should be in every single movie. Temeura Morrison was charming and Nicole Kidman did her best to not come off like the Reptilian that we all know she is. Patrick Wilson stole the show and I can't wait to see him as a full-fledged villain.

The fight choreography was fantastic, as was the camerawork during the fights. Atlanna's fight scene at the beginning of the film is probably up there with the Faora fight from Man of Steel and the warehouse scene from BvS for kickass fights in the DCEU. I also love how each fight fully utilized the environment it took place in. The Ring of Fire fight had both combatants trying to throw their opponent in the lava pit, the submarine fight had Arthur using porthole hatches and throwing enemies into periscopes, and Mera's use of the wine rack behind her in the village fight scene was a highlight for me. 

The CGI was great (much better than expected) and they definitely improved upon it since the original trailers dropped. The big battle scenes looked straight out of Star Wars and the giant crab monster looked like something from Pacific Rim. If that's not high praise, I don't know what is.

All in all, it was probably a 7/10 for me. I'd see it again, but I don't really need to. While I'm not salivating for more, I am excited for whatever comes next for these characters and this universe. ",a6qh98

The bad:

1. Dialoge was atrocious. It was cheesy and poorly acted. 

2. Jason Momoa is just not a good lead actor. I like him in GOT... because he didn’t have to say a lot and he spoke a made up language. He did not perform well in this movie IMO. 

3. SLOW MOTION FIGHTS. Wtf. Why is every goddamn fight shown in slow motion? Wonder Woman did this too and it’s so annoying. 

4. The Black Manta character. The suit design was awful. lol looked like a giant ant super man the could shoot frikin laser beams out of his giant eyes. Could have been done a lot better. 

5. Dialog constantly interrupted by explosions. Literally happened like five times. Gets old after awhile. 

6. The humor. They try to hard to copy marvel but it just doesn’t fit. For example, the bar scene could have been cut from the movie and it wouldn’t have made any difference. They butcher is just like the new Star Wars movies do. 

The good: 

1. The costumes (other than Black Manta) were pretty cool. Especially the white and red guards. I liked them.

It feels like a truly great, thrilling, hilarious movie existed in a version that’s 15 minutes shorter.

He just seemed angry and vengeful for the convenience of the plot. He just didn’t seem like a very strong or complex character.

It has been said many times before, but the ""Africa"" cover was atrocious and the music throughout didnt fit the tone.

However, I liked it for what it was and enjoyed it the whole way. The action sequences, especially the parts done in Sicily, where Wan employed one-takes and various other camera angles made the scene exciting. The colors and visuals, unlike the dreariness of other DC movies, was a nice change of pace. The set pieces and various settings were insane. It was a great space adventure in the sea.

ec956u3,"**My Complaint:** It suffers a common DC film trait--a very  fast faced character introductions .The  first third is just plain awful storytelling. The way you would just realize how this story would fit in with the whole DC universe by watching it midway thru  is truly absurd and very confusing for someone who is not the most familiar with Aquaman Mythos. In addition, this portion of the film is anchored by flashbacks after flashback. Characters just flood in and the non-linear narrative is not really a helping.  It felt rushed for some reasons.  In addition, the surface CGI is so awful and fakey in the big screen.  


**Highlights:** After the first third of the film, everything about the film just picks-up. The story, the CGI and the acting is amped up. When things started to focus with Aquaman fight vs his brother, everything just started to make a whole lot more sense. No more confusing Intros.  


In addittion, special mention for Heard and Momoa, they are truly the heart  of this film. They are such a charming personalities on screen that their chemistry even lift mediocre lines. The underwater CGI is also so glorious and intricate and translated extremely well in the cinema though I wish for more fish people next movie hihihi ( especially the trench scene). 

**Verdict:** A very fine film. Probably the most approachable of all the DC films~~(together with Wonder Woman).~~  Momoa and Heard are gems and would lifted the film from its limitation.

There were some truly special scenes that made me excited for the future of DC more than I have been before. If they A.) hired good writers, and B.) embraced the over the top cinematography (think the last shot where he says “I am aquaman”, and the shot with his massive sea beast rearing up out of the water), and dark dramatic shots (Orm’s cloak when he lands on the ship for the final battle and the scene with the trench/flares), in a future film, it would be amazing. It was more self aware than anything else I’ve seen from DC and it made it super enjoyable. Hope they keep doing more of the same, take some risks now that they see it works!!

The movie was downright awful. From the synthetic wigs that mera and Nicole Kidman wear(for gods sake could they even bother to brush the fucking hair or spend some type of money so it didn’t look so bad?) I have never seen such bad wigs used in a high budgeted movie. Yikes. 

Every scene with any dialogue had to end with an explosion. It was action overload. They would talk for two seconds then... EXPLOSION!!!! It gets too exhausting after awhile and overdone. I understand that it’s a superhero movie, but at least let me get some semblance of a story, character development, etc. the scenes where he was young or with family last for 2.5 seconds. The dialogue in this movie is the most cringeworthy I have ever seen. I thought ant man and the wasp was bad, but this is way worse and it isn’t even close. “I could’ve just pee’d on it.” And the scene where the guys take a pic with him at the bar with his PINK smart phone lmfao fucking ridiculous. How could anyone write this and have the gall to actually turn in this script? The worst part is that the script was actually approved by people. Every “joke” in the movie fell flat and Momoa and ambers chemistry was nonexistent. You can’t have two actors like this with such cheesy dialogue. It’s just not going to work.

Also, what is up with all the random music dispersed throughout the film? The most vexatious one was the scene where black manta was building his suit. That music did not fit that scene at all and was jarring.

The positive is that the action scenes were well choreographed and shot really well. Some of the visuals were great. The first action scene with Nicole Kidman was fantastic. At least the movie has that because most people will be entertained by the visuals and action, but for me that’s not all I want from a movie.

I thought I was crazy and maybe letting the reviews get to me. But my friend that literally likes EVERY movie, especially when it comes to action films said it was the worst he’s seen this year.

ecujihe,"After the higher quality of Wonder Woman after the train wreck of other DC movies I wondered if this would be similar.   Nope, it wasn't quite a train wreck but it was a very forgettable movie.  Cheesy dialogue and flashy low budget looking costumes with a simple plot.  I will say that it was pretty to watch.  The underwater scenes were very well done and the battle scenes had a cool look, but I was brought out of it either by Amber Heard's ridiculous hair, the dumb dialogue, or the Atlantians weird costumes.  DC continues to show me that it cannot compete with Marvel's winning formula and they're not even close.  This is a 6/10 for me.  Not the worst movie, but more like ""ehhh ok""",a6qh98
eddodd4,"This was bad. The script was bad. It was Cheesy the whole way throughout, I laughed audibly many times at the terrible lofty dialogue. This was the first movie I've seen this year and I still don't think anything will top that exchange about tears between Nicole Kidman and Jango Fett on the wharf for the worst piece of dialogue I'll see this year. I really felt Zack Synder's influence with the terrible delivery of over the top lofty dialogue about becoming a true hero, alongside the over the top action set pieces like the final underwater fight that had no build up and the Italian town being destroyed (which apparently no one noticed these weird alien suit guys destroying the town but whatever). 

Every character is pretty one dimensional and has no depth (pun intended). There's so many half baked ideas in here that just get forgotten or were unnecessary, like does anyone think Aquaman is an appropriate film to bring up ocean pollution and climate change for a scene and then not mention it again? It was just weird. The soundtrack is really bad too, it's so inconsistent. There's like synths, then there's some random electric guitar, and then there's random Fucking pop songs that are really out of place and distracting. Like that 10 seconds of the Africa cover was awful and so unnecessary 

It's a schloky, CGI fest that is entirely predictable. I was only bored around halfway, but I was mostly entertained by the schlock and the bad dialogue and cheese. It's not a good movie on any level really, it has some cool action scenes on land (mainly the first Nicole Kidman one), but some of the ones underwater are nauseating. Besides that, I honestly thought it had no real redeeming features. The CGI was good for the most part I guess, but it gets a bit tiring when you're whole movie is filled with it. 

It actually had a lot in common with the star wars prequels. A CGI fest movie with a messy script of one-dimensional characters and terrible dialogue.

ec8e586,"You know what I had fun. And with a movie about Aquaman, I never really thought we would be here one day. Not to mention this may be one of the most comic book-y movies I have ever seen.

There were so many story lines all stuffed in here:

Black Manta: Absolutely amazing, although I did feel his origin was just a tad bit rushed I do think they did it as best as they could. I love when they had the nod to the original helmet in the comics with the first one he was trying to make, but his updated design was just as cool and is still very accurate to the comics! And we see he's got some more room to grow with that end credits scene!

Oceanmaster: Holy cow, his costume was amazing. Once I saw it fully on screen I was thinking, ""Ok, this is 100% corny and I LOVE IT!"" Seriously, I've always had a problem with movies ""updating"" costumes so they wouldn't be ""corny"" but my god did this movie embrace it's comic roots! The reason we love comics and these characters is because of how they look! Any chance we can see a faithful adaptation of it you know comic fans will be pleased! Patrick Wilson did a very good job in the role but felt a little 2 dimensional, except at the end when he saw Atlanna which I'll admit was a nice scene.

The Trench: Man, I did not think we'd ever see these guys in a movie ever since being introduced in the comics not that long ago, but damn did they look good! And I must say the scene with them jumping shipping and then the trench following the flare was just GORGEOUS cinematography. Speaking of cinematography I also really liked the gladiator fight, I really dug the ""camera"" movements.

Aquaman: I was a huge skeptic of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in Justice League but holy hell did he blow my expectations in this movie. It even made me appreciate Justice League a little more because we were introduced to him but then we got his movie later on to really let him shine and develop! Well Done!

Mera: Honestly, not a big fan or her acting but her powers were done really well. Also, god Amber Heard is insanely hot...

CGI: I must say, CGI is this movie's strongest and weakest link at the same time. There were plenty of times were I could have sworn I was watching a cutscene from Injustice, and other times were I thought I've seen PS4 games with better quality. BUT...I feel like I can't really fault them for that because they were absolutely stretched thin. I swear this entire movie was 70-80% CGI. But it had to be, there was no way you can make an Aquaman movie without almost all of it CGI. And I will happily give props to DC for willing to take a chance like that for Aquaman KNOWING how much it would cost.

Honestly, overall it was a fun and very enjoyable film and just may be my favorite DCEU movie yet (well it WAS a low bar to begin with). James Wan did amazing and I hope this is a sign of better things to come for the DCEU!",a6qh98

The de-aging effects were not good, the CGI fish looked cartoonish.

I don't know what it is, but just like Wonder woman, the CGI was too much and really took me out of the movie. Especially during the under water scenes. Everything except their faces were CGI at one point. Even the suits and capes, which too me looked really bad or unsettling.

I wish they would be more reserved with the CGI but I don't think DCs characters lend themselves to that. Most of their characters have flashy godlike super powers so CGI is required for pretty much everything. I really miss Nolan's Dark Knight because, while there was CGI it meshed so well with reality that I never felt overwhelmed by it.

Same with Marvel movies. There's plenty of CGI but most scenes have some reality to ground and balance it out.

ec8td55,"I've seen it twice now, really enjoyed it. Such a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Yes, it definitely had some issues but nothing that was especially jarring.

&#x200B;

Negative - It definitely suffered from origin story syndrome which considering the character was introduced in justice league, it really didn't need. I feel like all of the flashback sequences with Vulko could have been taken out and it wouldn't have impacted the story at all. Also, some of the acting was a little dodgy, especially the actors playing young versions of aquaman. The film also does take a little long to get going, its quite a while before aquaman actually shows up, which is once again origin story issues. The dialogue was clunky at times as well.

Positive - Visuals. Just see the movie and you'll understand what I mean, it looked incredible. There wasn't a single moment where the CGI took me out of the movie. Also, the fight sequences were incredible. That opening fight scene with Atlanna done with a one camera effect moving around was breathtaking. Jason Momoa is fantastic in the role and is a brilliant leading man, he was so fun to watch and made a completely ridiculous character work. Also, Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal job with what he was given, and made all the ridiculous dialogue work. Also, the trench scene, holy shit. But my favourite thing about this film was it surprised me, twice. Once with the centre of the earth reveal with dinosaurs, and again in the final battle when we see Mary Poppins's true form.

There were moments of greatness, mostly in the visuals. They pulled off Black Manta in almost every way. The visual look of Atlantis was terrific. The gold and green didn't look retarded.

But...the acting. This wasn't cheese, it was stinky rotten refuse. Momoa was just bro-boy until the plot said stop it. Heard was awkward as hell as Mera. Wilson as Orm...that must be the worst villain turn since Jupiter Ascending. Equal parts bland and screaming. Dafoe was criminally wasted. Kidman and Jamgo Fett were great if mostly absent.

And the theft! Kidman's reveal? We've seen this twice now: once in How to Train Your Dragon 2, and again in Ant Man 2. The look? Drowned Avatar. The plot? Bad Romancing the Stone ripoff. The sinking moment? Hello, Pitch Black.

James Wan really went full Aquaman comic book on us and it’s exactly what I wanted. Some of the jokes fell a little flat and were corny but others really landed. I feel like the movie knew what it was and that’s where some of the corny stuff came from. I mean cmon it’s about a merman that can talk to fish, some things are gonna be a little weird and corny. Also I feel like every time things started to chill out and they were working towards their goal there was some kind of explosion and you knew the action was starting. Always started with an explosion out of nowhere. And then there was the scene with black manta creating his suit. The scene was fine and I enjoyed it but what a poor choice of music for it. I was hoping for something badass and villainous. What an iconic scene though. Overall I really enjoyed the film! The monsters in it were very well done and James Wan really killed it with the design and characters. Can’t wait for the next time we see Aquaman! Go out and enjoy the film and if I have any recommendation that would mean the most, see it in IMAX!!!!

eca3t7f,"Alright, so.. yeah. As a DC fanboy I'm a bit disappointed. Not that it was bad, it wasn't, it was alright, but the bad parts could've been so easily avoided and it kinda pisses me off.

So, the great:

- fighting scenes
- Wan creates a beautiful world, both visually and culturally
- Arthur's dad carries this film, he's the heart and soul of it. Nicole Kidman was also a fresh breath.
- Arthur and his dad have a great dynamic
- FINALLY A SUPERHERO WITHOUT A TRAGIC STORY/PARENT HEALTH STATUS
- Arthur and Mira are treated as equals and that's great. I haven't seen a superhero film that balances the male and female lead without making one a doormatt for the other, or a damsel in distress. They both sass each other, they both save each other. Neither comes out looking like a fool, the relationship feels equally tilted.
- The 3rd act was great
- Arthur not knowing Pinocchio was also a book is fkn hilarious
- Mira and Arthur had good acting, though I question some of the stuff they made Arthur say.

The bad:

- Explosions during dialogue ( counted like 4, wtf man )

- Really weird music choice on 2 scenes ( Pitbull and the fight in Sicilia )

- Some kinda cheesy lines

- I actually think Orm's story doesn't make sense. Why is everyone rallying behind this dude when Steppenholf zapped into Atlantis and STOLE the Motherbox, their most prized possession?

Like holy fuck Orm's nukes just got stolen by the commies, he really shouldn't have support to go on a world war. I kinda feel like Wan forgot about than teeny tiny detail.

- Arthur not knowing Mira's name when they talk in Justice League feels a bit weird

- Arthur went from a silent badass with a few jokes here and there into straight goofy. I'm not sure I like it, I remember the stoic Aquaman from the JL series. The JL already has Flash and Cyborg as the BOOYAH dudes, I'm not sure they needed another in that dynamic.

- Some moments are kinda ruined by the writing. Arthur has a great speech for the Kraken and then he ends it with "" Go screw yourself "", kinda ruined the moment. There's a few of those.
- Orm's dialogue is kinda pish posh and he comes across as moustache twirling at times, but I guess I can excuse that as him being over the top to hype up his followers.

All in all, 7-7.5/10, where 10/10 is Infinity War and The Dark Knight.

I'd rank it slightly below Wonder Woman and Man of Steel.

eccr8fw,"Just some thoughts after coming back: 

* The audience absolutely LOVED this movie. I've also never seen so many people cheering over a costume reveal!

* I'd say 55-60% of the audience was **women**, and they were absolutely losing it over Jason Momoa's shirtless scenes.

* This movie imo takes the crown for best visuals in a comic book movie by far. Not once did I think the CGI looked bad except for (ironically) Ocean Master's costume. The action was also top notch.

* The audio underwater was at times hard to hear, but I also realize that it gives it a unique underwater effect. 

* The Trench scene was AMAZING! Would love to see more of that horror vibe in the sequel, as it had my whole theater on edge the entire time, even getting a few gasps and jumps at the first appearance of the trench. 

* The costume designs and makeup/prosthetics were phenomenal. I felt like everything in this movie had genuine life to it, from the Fisherman and Crab people (did anyone get the Scottsman from Samurai Jack vibes from the king!?), to the vehicles themselves. If I were to rank movies in terms of world building, I'd rank this in the top 5 of any movie ever (along with Avatar, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix).

* The music/soundtrack was good in some spots and could have been better in others. For the sequel, they should stick to an original score, as the parts with the original score were clearly more poignant (vs Africa/Pitbull).

* There were a few scenes that could have been trimmed: most of Vulko scenes, the fountain scene in Italy, Atlanna vs Atlantians at the start of the movie

* There were also a few scenes I thought they should have extended: i.e. Arthur's backstory, Black Manta waiting in the ocean (wish we could have seen the stars more!).

Black Manta was such a terrible character, all of his scenes were trash. The only good part with him was after his father died and you could see the rage in his eyes. 

Dialogue overall was pretty bad. It was very heavy on exposition, not even cleverly hidden exposition. Just straight up yeah this is what happened and this is what we need to do now. 

I do think the critical reception for this movie is fair. It’s not fantastic, I could see how plenty of people would not enjoy themselves. I could also see how plenty of people could enjoy themselves.

There was somehow simultaneously no plot and too much plot, which totally detracted from the fun I was supposed to be having.

The ridiculous pirate revenge portion was totally unnecessary -- it leaned way too heavily on the ""you killed my father"" trope and was totally nonsensical. The pirate should've been like ""I get that I'm a bad guy but I'm reasonably intelligent and understand that if someone is literally trying to kill you, you kind of have a reason to kill them first. Why don't we make this plot a little more nuanced and save it for a different movie."" And oy gevalt -- if you're going to open with a bunch of violent pirate thieves, DON'T MAKE THEM BLACK.

ec8noty,"I really enjoyed this film, it was actually a lot of fun and I think that comes down to James Wan's direction, the action and the likability of the leads. I had a big smile on my face throughout.

Personally I felt like everything else fell a little flat, especially the script which was really heavy handed (More So than other superhero films which are already heavy handed). It just felt a little less organic and more Fast and Furious. The amount of times they reminded the audience Nicole Kidman got thrown in the trench got tiring.

There were a few moments that were unintentionally funny. Like the flashback between Vulko and young Aquaman where he gets mad for not telling him about his mom. Moments like that where it didn't feel self aware felt really bad. The music also felt off and unmemorable.

When it leaned into the cheese it was hilarious like the whole romance in italy sequence when they eat the roses. It was endearing and funny. The entire adventure/quest aspect was great.

James Wan did a fantastic job with the action sequences they were so much better than a lot of superhero/blockbuster action. The hand to hand combat was fantastic.

When people said this had good cinematography I thought it was going to be another situation where 'Pretty colours/Slow motion = Good cinematography' but the film had genuinely good cinematography most of the time. It was blocked out so the camera actually moves and develops with the scene and the transitions were incredibly inventive. You could tell Wan was having fun with it when he threw in a dolly zoom at the start and he executed the action fantastically. I do think it fell flat when Wan would shoot dialogue scenes against a green screen (which happens a fair amount), it's suddenly became very static and he overuses Ken Burns (Digital zoom).

**TlDr - Good direction/leads/action/visuals, Bad script/music**

**Overall a lot of fun, I would recommend it (Unless you haven't seen Spider Verse yet. If not, get of your ass) because I had a huge smile on my face throughout. Rose eating scene was funny.**

ecvej0i,This was a Marvel type movie so no wonder it is doing a lot of cash just like the MCU. From now on DC movies will be similar to the MCU and do a lot at the box office. Like it or not this is what the general audience wants from their superhero movies after all.,a6qh98

ec8y6ik,"The effects were great (though the cinematography was a little tiring on the eye; they should have eased up on that, though maybe they wanted you to feel tired because that's what a human would feel like in Atlantis?). Momoa, Kidman, Abdul-Mateen and Wilson acted well. The arc they covered is a pretty interesting one that could have been exploited so much. Even the original score (not the soundtrack, which was... off) was very good.

It's just that the script was sooo. **Bad**. *So very, very bad*. It suffered from the same problems Justice League, Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad suffered from: everything is sped up, so nothing is earned. Unnecessary and clumsy exposition speech that covers relevant information they skipped showing. Characters that appear out of thin air for no discernible reason because they saved time by eliminating their background stories. Random behavior that one can't find a reason for because characters lack depth and motive since everything was so condensed. The battles themselves seemed wasted because you didn't really had any horse in the race and the fight itself was sped up so that the climatic real battle could happen.

Seems to me that Warner Bros. and DC should seriously consider finding better script doctors, and just stop chasing the Marvel hare. That hare is gone, they won't be able to catch it. The best they can do is at least make their stories compelling so that people will still choose to watch them, even if they are ""something old style"" already.

It just seemed like a wasted movie to me. You could have made one, even two really good movies out of this but they just chose to throw everything on the table at once. And like having a meal at a fancy restaurant and eating the entreé, main course and dessert on a single bite, it just tasted rather bad and made you wonder how great it could have been if it paced itself.",a6qh98

Like does she let them casually try and pry it out before eating them? Action was great, visuals were amazing. I liked the bad guy soundtrack.

Seeing Willem Dafoe with a man-bun was really fucking jarring and I could not get over that. Every single scene of Jason Momoa and Amber Heard having flirty banter made me want to gouge my eyes out. I can't tell if the dialogue in those scenes was especially terrible, if the actors just weren't very good or that they had no chemistry... But it's probably some combination of all those factors.

ecli940,"Some reason I did not like Kidman's acting and I kept seeing Aquaman's dad as Jango Fett (think he was the main voice actor for the video games as well, but he did do a good job in the film for his small part IMO). 

I also thought Patrick Wilson was miscast, because he was supposed to be younger than Mamoa's character. Granted they are only 5 years apart in real life. But Mamoa looks like he's in his early 30s, and Wilson looks like he's in his 40s. So that threw me off. Also, it was hard for me to picture Patrick Wilson as being stronger than Mamoa... even if it was literally happening in front of my eyes for the first part of the movie.

Also Dolph Lundgren was a miscast to me, even if it was a small part. And honestly, it's the small things that can add up.

On the bright side, thought Mamoa did a good spin on Aquaman, at least it should make Aquaman a fan favorite. Amber Heard, Dafoe, and the guy who plays Black Manta were good as well. 

Overall, thought it was an ok film with a pretty poor script but had good production value as whole. A step in the right direction for the DC CU, but still far away from competing with a MCU movie. ",a6qh98

It still had a bit of the convolutedness that the DCEU is known for, but not enough to ruin the movie.

",a6qh98
ec8u3vs,"What a fun and awesome superhero movie. Loved Amber Heard as Mera and Momoa really surprised me he’s great for this version of Aquaman DCEU has chosen to take. James Wan has done it again he really understands how to do cheesy action movie type stuff well. The visuals were outstanding, props to the cgi team and the writers and Wan again. 

My biggest concern coming in was how he would juggle most of Aquaman’s main comic villains. They laid some great groundwork for future sequel characters with Ocean master, Black Manta, the Trench, and Dr. Shin. What a beautiful and action packed movie I really hope this gets the DCEU back on track. Only gripes were that I didn’t think Momoa and Heard had the greatest chemistry for a romance themed film but that’s a small petty gripe. Main one is the first two hip hop songs in the first hour felt so out of place. Good god how did those songs make the final cut... especially when the film score was fantastic besides that. 

But ya I’m drunk and rambling now haha so I’ll end it by saying hats off to James Wan and your big brass balls you took a lot of gambles, had a very ambitious film in mind and boy did it pay off. That was everything I could’ve ever wanted from an Aquaman movie. I’m honestly still in shock of how much Aquaman lore he was able to fit in one movie godammit Wan you are one hell of a filmmaker.

It went so well with the trailer and it just makes everything so epic. Whatever song they ended up playing was so out of place. I almost fell asleep the second it started playing.",a6qh98
ec8ice9,"I’ll run through my thoughts based on some categories. 

Editing was really poor in the first 15 minutes. Like, I didn’t know what the hell was going on. It fixed itself a lot as it went on although it did suffer from pretty subpar transitions until the Africa scenes. Speaking of which....

The music was bad. No other way to put it. The score was very generic and having that Pitbull song was especially out of place....

Outside of Aquaman and Mira the characters were really lame. This was not aided at all by the generally crappy writing DC films are notorious for. Many of the “jokes” fell flat and the exposition was annoying although important for the world....

The world building was honestly great. The different areas and kingdoms each looked unique and I found the creature designs to be especially outstanding. Costumes were also amazing and never came across as out of place.....

Action scenes were generally pretty good. The third act’s underwater battle was freaking badass. I could watch those crustaceans go at it with the shark riders all day. I also liked the tracking shots a lot, they weren’t overused so when they came up they felt especially interesting.....

Cinematography was above average throughout but really shined in the second half of the movie. I think the color palette worked really well as well. Helped the movie feel more light and fun. I was annoyed a bit by how many times they would show the same thing from three different angles though. That’s more of a personal gripe....

This movie seemed really hit or miss in terms of what worked and what didn’t. There were some scenes that were unintentionally hilarious (like Manta running from the guy holding the bomb in the submarine, shit was hilariously shot) which, to be fair, made the movie more entertaining at the cost of its quality.....

Movie is definitely fun although I wouldn’t say it’s good. The writing and scene to scene editing made it feel like a video game plot. Epic fight scenes in the second half almost redeem a first half which meanders along and feels rather disjointed from the rest of the film. Character design and settings were bomb, feels like they really brought the spirit of Aquaman out in the design of everything. Improve the characters and writing so as to make the movie less predictable and copy-paste and you’d have yourself a pretty decent film. But as it sits now its shortfalls really harm it. 

3.5/10 

Edit: I’m pretty harsh on movies so take my word with a grain of salt. I did enjoy it a lot and I’ll rewatch it for sure. I don’t feel like enjoyment is inherently tied to the quality of a movie. Hell, Venom was one of my favorites this year in terms of how much I enjoyed it even if it was pretty terrible. Aquaman was the first DC movie since Man of Steel I felt like I had a good time watching. It has its down moments but overall it’s good fun. ",a6qh98

ec8cc2a,"I feel like some critics are being too harsh on this, maybe it’s the MCU vs DCEU thing but I loved this movie. Great visuals, action scenes were on point and solid acting from the supporting cast. 

However, the one liners don’t really work and I didn’t feel any chemistry between Jason and Amber. She was good when she did her own scenes but something is missing when they are both together. The Italy and Trench scene stood out, I’ll give it a 7.5/10. ",a6qh98
ec8n939,"Immediately the visuals are great, but the pictures don’t make the movie. There needs to be good dialogue, editing, character, and good memorable establishing shots. 

I honestly don’t remember any lines of dialogue from this movie.  The jokes never landed, or the speeches were too long and predictable along which character path they were (bad guys are loud and yell, or good guys are soft and cliche). 

There isnt much to distinguish the places from each other outside of visual differences. Some places are evil because evil, and some just exist. 

The viewer is constantly fed useless dialogue that goes nowhere to help breathe air into a world at the bottom of a generic sea.

Aquaman is horribly predictable, which makes it so boring to watch.

It also makes me bummed that the next Wonder Woman movie is already made because I want to see a Wonder Woman movie that involves the Amazons as much as this movie involved the Atlanteans.

I honestly don't understand how people can be complaining about explosions or cheesy lines or wine spears or sharks with lasers. I feel like people need to be reminded that this is a comic book movie and not an historical re-enactment.

- Stingray on the TV at the beginning.
- The Octopus playing drums.

It’s not perfect, some pacing issues and a lot of moments where people explode randomly because a baddie enters the scene but I honestly thought that might have been intentional to an extent.

eccv2je,"So I'll preface my review by saying I grew up with the edgy DC of the late 80s/early 90s and find I prefer my comic book films more serious, realistic, artistic, and deconstructionist - so stuff like M. Night's Unbreakable, the Nolan Trilogy, and Snyder's Watchman, MoS, and BvS (my fav superhero film of all time).

As for Aquaman, I thought it was just ok. The story was well told but was pretty thin and basic (if you're familiar with the Throne of Atlantis plotline you'll know almost everything that is coming). The seasoned actors (Kidman, Dafoe, Wilson) really shined, but Amber Heard...well, she's not that great of an actress. Jason was fine as Arthur. The soundtrack was good (except for the badly placed pop songs), but never reached Zimmer levels. The costumes and character design was spot on and probably the most impressive thing about the whole movie for me.

All that said, the movie was a little too cheesy and lighthearted (at times) for my taste. I'll concede that it's probably difficult to make a serious film about a guy who talks to fish and rides around on sea horses, but I found the artificial look of the underwater scenes, the breakneck pace, and over the top CGI fest action to be a little tiring. This is a problem I have with most modern blockbusters though.

The movie spends most of the time explaining the backstory, setting up the main plot, cutting to action scenes, and then wrapping things up. There was very little downtime to develop characters or let the film breathe. The bits that we did get, whether it was Vulko training Arthur, or Arthur and Mera in Italy, were highlights to me. I will give it props for not killing the villains and for resolving the main conflict in an interesting way.

Overall, Aquaman is a well made, straightforward superhero film that is sure to please crowds and lapsed DC fans, but it doesn't offer up much new (besides the underwater aesthetic), isn't particularly ground breaking, or thought provoking, or artistic, and it's story and characters aren't especially memorable, which, in this era of comic book film saturation, makes it painfully average.

I didn't feel the movie was insulting to fans like Justice League, but I hope WB eventually has the guts to go in bold directions with the genre again rather than just playing it safe going forward.",a6qh98

I hated how they muffled the voices to make it realistic because under water you wouldn't be talking so clearly, but in a movie you want the voices to be clear. Nobody was a memorable character. I kept saying plenty of times *oh that's his name* for Arthur's brother.

Nicole Kidman's ""armor"" in the trench was God awful.

ecct201,"Huge DC and DCEU fan, and I had a great time. It's nice to have a DCEU movie not be so messy so I can talk about it with friends without having to make excuses for it.

I like every single character in the movie. They were all fleshed out well and given some background for why they act the way they do. I also found it interesting that many of the DCEU movies have put such a massive importance on parents.

The action and visuals are top notch. Anyone complaining about CGI can go ahead and propose a better way to film an underwater war with sharks and giant sea horses. It's not real guys, move on.

I appreciate that Aquaman went from being an Aryan poster boy that would give Hitler a boner to being a Polynesian Atlantian mix. His race was a focal point for why Aquaman was hated by some people in Atlantis.

Want had fun with this film and it got in the way sometimes. I mostly appreciated the corniness and silliness and have to remind myself this is a comic book movie meant for fun. Still appreciated some mention of environmental responsibility without bashing us over the head about it.

edco1dr,"My dad is currently 47, and has watched probably 10,000 movies in his lifetime. He loves them, and always gives a movie it's fair shake even when he's pretty confident its not that good or just not to his liking. Because of that, he's only ever walked out on two other movies in the theatre in his life. ""Cabin Fever,"" and ""Jason goes to Hell"".

My dad was so excited to see this after watching the previews and hearing good reviews from critics online (specifically Chris Stuckman), so it seemed like a good way to spend time at the theater.

Fast forward to today, his birthday, and he asked me, my mom and my sister to come see it with him, and was super pumped up over the whole week to see how well DC could tell Aquaman's story. 

I can't stress to you how absolutely terrible this movie is. None of us could come up with a reason to care for anybody in this film, especially Aquaman. The terrible writing really dragged down a potentially decent story, and the utter nonsense of what we were seeing on screen was just making us question who greenlights this shit. 

At one point, my mom went to the bathroom during Black Manta's engineering scene when he makes his gear (spoilers: while Depeche Mode is neat the scene was incredibly stupid), and the three of us still sitting in the theatre all collectively agreed that we wanted to walk out as soon as she got back. I can't stress to you how long of a wait that was for my mom to get back.

Absolutely terrible movie. We were ready to refund the tickets, but I saw last minute that Spiderverse had a showing in just 18 minutes, and told my dad that he needed to watch that instead. (Me and my sister saw it, him and my mom hadn't yet.) Needless to say he feeling much better now and his birthday wasn't (totally) ruined.

I have absolutely no clue how this movie has made so much money.

Also, I loved the visual jokes waaaay more than the spoken ones. The “tale of the tape” of sorts they had for Arthur and Orm’s duel with the pros and cons, and obviously the octopus drums...

Wan really balanced the fun and serious and was able to avoid the cheesiness especially with how much of a comedy punching bag, Aquaman was before the movie. The visuals are striking especially the Trench scenes. Also had a great crew especially whoever he got as a Costume Designer.  
  
I liked the story touches including the button of his parents love story in the beginning and the end. Momoa really sold the everyman personality of his human side while learning his Atlantan side. Solid casting throughout including Black Manta.  
  
A couple of minor peeves: I don't think you needed the idea of Kanes to set-up Aquaman providing mercy to his brother, they were murdering pirates who killed for money. Some minor pacing things, etc.

ecj9ymi,"Saw it last night. Had a pleasant experience even though the script was awful. I recommend being high for the movie, it makes you more able to get past the awful dialogue and plot holes while really enjoying the scenery.

Totally worth seeing in 3d by the way. 3d is often an afterthought in post production and makes things worse, but this one used it really well. It enhanced the wonder of all the grand sweeping camera movements around all the sea life.

It tried to be too serious. Jason Mamoa has natural charisma and you can tell he's having fun with it, so the movie should've catered to him having fun with it. Make his character have a goofy sense of humor, take advantage of that natural charm, and don't worry about the whole thing being campy. Roll with it. It would've come off as more charming than the attempt to be more serious.

The dialogue and characterization is awful. Aquaman goes from being a laid back but smart, savvy dude to a dumbass who can't remember anything in every other conversation. He went from empathically not wanting to be the king to suddenly feeling like he was born to be the king for no apparent reason. They really didn't flesh out why it was even so important that he be the king, and why the second son's advisor and bethrothed risked their lives to save him. Seems like they could've gone more into that.

It also just sort of seemed to be two movies crammed into one. We have a very rushed origin story (we get the aquarium scene followed immediately by him having his full on aquaman powers) - and then we have two villains in a movie that doesn't really need them. It feels like they cut some parts short (him discovering/becoming aquaman) in favor of overly complicating the story with two villains.

Black Mantis seemed like maybe he could've been a good villain if he was the villain of his own movie, but just didn't work very well as a basically side character. Also, that costume/atlantean armor was kind of ridiculous. ""Oh shit, I'm being hunted by a humanoid fly, in the water!""

The world building makes so little sense. Okay, so the biker guys in the bar come up to him and want a group selfie. That's actually the sort of not taking itself seriously scene the movie should've had more of. And on the news, early on, he's called ""the meta-human aquaman"". So society apparently knows there's a superhero roaming around and what he looks like and that he's an Atlantean, but no one is studying him or trying to find his home or anything. We're told repeatedly that the surface dwellers don't believe in the existence of the Atlanteans, even though we've got people recognizing him in bars for a selfie. At the conclusion of the movie, we also see the news with a blank photo captioned ""Aquaman?!"" as if this were a new concept to them that only came to light after the resolution of the movie. How, then, earlier in the movie is he treated like everyone knows who he is and that he's a superhero?

Okay, so if humans don't believe in Atlanteans, why the fuck are they sending a lone sub down to the ruins of Atlantis to blow up some statues with a torpedo? That's what causes the whole fucking war and makes no sense at all. ""Hey, we don't think Atlantis is real or anything, but we think we found some underground statues or some shit, so instead of sending archaelogists let's go ahead and send one random sub to blow those statues up for no reason. If the humans secretly knew that Atlantis was real and it was a threat, it's not indicated anywhere, and specifically contradicted with all the ""surface dwellers don't believe we exist"" stuff. But if the military secretly knew, they'd sure as fuck do something more potent than firing a random torpedo at some old rusty sunken statues.

So, in conclusion, a waste of Mamoa's charm, can't figure out whether to take itself seriously or not, wildly inconsistent world building, two movie plots crammed into one, the whole hidden king and his supporters plotline isn't very well established as why it's necessary, bad dialogue, plot holes.

But really pretty scenery. Better direction and action sequences than most comic book movies. The humanoid hand to hand/weapon to weapon fighting was surprisingly well shot. All the expansive shots of Atlantean architecture and sea creatures were very cool. And since that's like 85% of the movie by screen time it's sort of redeeming.

Honestly, I think seeing this movie in a foreign language you don't understand without subtitles would make it better. You would get the gist of it, enjoy the scenery, and assume all the dialogue and story parts were better than they actually were if you didn't understand them. ",a6qh98

Does the director not know how to organically transition from a conversation into an action sequence? Why is the battle always conveniently when the person stops talking? Did the bad guys wait for people to stop talking because they thought it would hurt their feelings?

I did love the trench imagery. That was very cool and artistic. Perfectly describes what it feels like to go to sleep in your bed as a 6 year old.
 
Now onto an important discussion point. To the people that hated Man of Steel because Superman did not ""save"" the people that died in the city, what are your thoughts about this final battle? Aquaman literally brought an Old God that killed both innocent and guilty alike. With Man of Steel at least you can say that Clark did not mean to bring Zod to earth.

ec8iugj,"Personally, I didn't think it was a bad movie, but it wasn't a great one either. Visually it looked great, and that is probably the films strongest point. But I do have quite a few problems with this film. 

I think one of my biggest problems with the movie was Jason Mamoa. His line delivery was quite bad throughout the film. This made the jokes very hit and miss, mostly miss for me. It doesn't help that a lot of the dialogue was very cheesy and would probably be difficult for anyone to pull off, but still, I don't really think he is the best leading man.

The villains were another issue I had with this film. I didn't think either black Manta or Orm were very compelling characters. Both actually weren't really very good actors either. But both characters lacked depth.

The story itself was ok. I think the idea was basically King Arthur underwater, which I think is an interesting idea. However, I don't really think it was executed that well. It got kind of boring for me in many parts. It was also kind of predictable. I don't know if we were supposed to believe the mother was dead, but I knew from the get go she was still alive and they will likely find her by the trench.

I did think the action sequences were pretty cool for the most part. I really liked the one in Sicily. The big battle underwater was also another highlight.

Overall, this movie isn't really good enough to win my trust back in the DCEU, but it was at least decent. I'm going to be perhaps a bit generous based on my comments and give it a 6/10.",a6qh98
eca7xqu,"I really dont know how to feel about this film.. 

The plot was okay, dialogue was hit or miss all throughout, while the fights were great, the CGI was lacking (the Trench and grande finale CGI reminded me of The Witcher 3 graphics). Was anybody else bothered by how clean and shiny the armour in this film looked? It looked too clean and gleamy IMO. 

At the very least, the film proved me wrong and showed Jason Momoa could carry a film with a solid director backing him up.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but it feels like I've seen this all before.

I'm gonna give it a solid 6.75/10, it was fun, but that's basically the only thing that it had going for it. Hopefully a sequel can improve upon this first solo outing.",a6qh98

eebd5eb,"Confession: I'm Canadian, but am commenting here as Canada gets the US release version of almost every film made ever so.... 



Now, I enjoyed this movie for the most part but three things have caused me to downgrade it from ""really good"" to ""decently good"", one of them being a big thing for a certain group of actual IRL people, a subset  of which i am part, and the other two being sensory issues (at least in my case, in someone else's case they could be health issues). 


Issue one, the big one for me and others of the particular people group i belong to: the repeated use, mostly uncalled out on, of the word ""half-breed"" (or as my people generally refer to it as the ""h-slur"" or ""h-word"" ) in reference to Arthur/Aquaman.   For any one who is a bi-racial Indigenous person, or otherwise bi-racial, this word is a slur and an insult,  the very worse slur and insult imaginable at that, and we all know it. For  a Métis person, which is my specific subset of  the broad bi-racial Indigenous people category, this word carries a hell of a lot of history, all of it negative. To hear this slur used five times (FIVE) in dialogue and see it used twice in print (that Atlantean hologram thing that showed up just before the ring of fire battle started) against Arthur really made me mad. And yes, Arthur used it once about himself, but as someone to whom the insulting definition of the word applies, he can reclaim it and use it about himself (much as some real life Métis  and other bi-racial Indigenous people  or their family members do) without it being a slur or an insult.  But for anyone else to use it against him, well that makes it an insult. However I fully acknowledge that this is a personal issue and not one that is universal.  All three times i've seen it so far, I literally sat up straighter  in my seat every time it was used against him and the third time I saw the movie (with a friend i'd pre-warned about it), growled low a little. 


Issues two and three:  1) the explosions were quite loud. I'm autistic  and  as they were loud and a little jarring to the rest of the  theatre, they really bothered me my ears and thus i was distracted.  2) the bright flashes that happened during several of the battles. Those were very distracting and hurt my eyes. Sensory issues are a real and ongoing thing with autistic people.

 

Aside for these issues i really enjoyed the moive. I liked that they had cast Jason Moamoa as Aquaman back in Justice League and somehow it felt right to have Aquaman not be this white dude with blonde hair and all that. It felt like it was time to cast someone unexpected in this role. Somehow it just works for me.",a6qh98

The submarine fight choreography was horrible, but it would have been a lot more drawn out if it was actually logical.

You just can’t take it too seriously. There were a lot of times I stopped and asked myself why people were doing things (firing explosives by much larger explosives, waiting around and pausing  for some dramatic moment to come by instead of just attacking, black manta giving the classic villain reveal on how they’re tracking them when he had no need for it, the whole basis for attacking the surface was to save the sea life but they were happy to quickly switch it up and just start lasering some fish when they turn on them).

* Atlanteans can swim at super speed, have night vision and speak underwater, which is cool. But when they speak, does water not enter their mouths, and why dont air bubbles appear during speech?

* was Atlantis confirmed to be more technologically advanced as a society before it went underwater? Like with the trident powers in effect, it looked like it was rebuilt to be just as sophisticated in water.

For some background the last superhero movie I saw was Black Panther, so going from a mainly black cast to seeing only two black guys who are both villains was kinda dissapointing. To follow that up there wasn't any real explanation as to why they were bad, they just were. It was made even worse by the fact that the supposed good guy aquaman just lets the guy's dad die. I don't get the point of having the ""bad guy"" beg aquaman to help save his dad and having an emotional scene about the dad dying, if there are litterally zero consequences for it.

You would think aquaman could relate to losing a parent because at that point his mom was still dead, but he just doesn't care. He just moves on and basically kills him when he sees him in Rome or wherever they went. In the sequence directly after Aquaman's dad almost dies, giving the film a chance to build a parallell between him and Manta, but he doesn't, making the scene kinda useless. When he does actually talk about the incident he acts like he didn't pin him against the wall and leave him to drown, saying ""I guess he thinks its my fault he died"".

Overall I would say I enjoyed it. This looks to be a course correcting ship for the DCEU and if so I'm mostly on board with it. 

#Pros

* Gorgeous movie. This was in post-production forever and it shows. Many of the scenes look like paintings come to life. [The trench diving scene](https://youtu.be/BFm564nYFxI?t=38) with Arthur/Mera swimming through the creatures swarming around them was beautiful. And [the accompanying score](https://youtu.be/FwIpFiG4jBI) made it haunting. Above all else the movie is a visual spectacle. 

* It's probably the most brutal DCEU film yet in terms of just how much punishment people take falling through stuff. So many times dudes would crash through roofs, smack onto rocks coupled with sfx + fast camera work and it made everything much more bone-hurty. Especially the scene with Black Manta getting a giant concrete ball smashed into his face, his helmet exploding, and [ragdoll bouncing down the rocky hillside](https://youtu.be/FbpSwXf3CJY?t=4). 

* It's cheeky fun without going *too* overboard in the goofiness (*mostly, until the end*). It rides a thin line and for the most part balances the sincerity and the absurdity. 

* That final battle though was high test premium schlock. The kind of golden schlock prospectors rushed California for back in dickity-two. I had to muffle my laughter because it was goddamned bonkers! People riding sharks with laser charging crab-people like a fucking '80s Sunday morning cartoon. Pure gratuitous eye-candy in all the right ways. Then the Krak... or, no. The ""Karathen"" shows up. Nah, fuck that name. Kraken. It's clearly the Kraken, let's just call it the Kraken, right? The Kraken from Clash of the Titans shows up and goes all ""**rawr**"" with a bunch of *pew pew* GI Joe lasers all around it and I was laughing hysterically while all this was happening. This final battle made the price of admission worth it.

* It's a small touch but I liked that they gave everybody slight audio warping when talking underwater. Noticeable but not grating or distracting, and after a while you don't even give it a bother.

* They did the villains right. You have Orm trying to usurp control, easy to get his motivation both in terms of lust for power as well as simply being tired of regular humans dumping so much shit in their territory. And you have Black Manta being the real badass of the two villains. Dude owned every scene he was in. 

* THERE WAS A MOTHERFUCKING OCTOPUS PLAYING DRUMS LIKE THIS WAS THE LITTLE MERMAID HOT DAMN!

* Momoa was perfect casting. He gives what many people consider the goofiest Superfriends character some necessary gravitas. Since so many dingledongs today are still stuck on 1973's idea of Aquaman. 

* Patrick Wilson went full [Jeremy Irons in Dungeons & Dragons](https://youtu.be/BV3roWM0DSs) with his scenes. He was such a ham that Danny Devito wanted to infuse him with rum. It was beautiful. 

* Arthur is actually a hero. He doesn't seem to be in anguish when trying to help people. He doesn't seem like he wants to be doing literally anything else besides helping those he's giving aid to. No. He genuinely enjoyed helping people in this movie. That's exactly what you need DC. More of that. Lesson learned, don't let people that believe in Ayn Rand write/direct the characterizations of your heroes. 

* The movie was a standalone movie, not a chess piece being shuffled around to set up the next movie. This is where so many other of these ""*cinematic universe*"" movies fail. They care so much about the next step that they fuck up the step they're on. Besides a quick Steppenwolf reference in a throwaway line you would never know this is even part of the greater DCEU.

* Arthur learning regret in inaction. He realized the fault in his actions with not saving a dude when he was easily capable of doing so, and almost got himself/Mera killed later because of it. It was a solid life lesson for him to learn and build on, making him a better hero in the future. We, the audience, need to see these little ""*lessons*"" to understand just why they, the Heroes, are always so compelled to help everyone even if they're bad people. 

#CONS

* The soundtrack (*not the score*) was abysmal. Who tf thought [Pitbull's cover of Toto's Africa](https://youtu.be/VQsvACk6vxs?t=9) was a good choice? [Honestly?](https://youtu.be/an0bVaTjF_Y?t=16) And then they walk out the water all super sexy going 100% full Blue Steel with it like this is a fucking music video now? Seriously the soundtrack was jarring as all fuck in this movie and whatever suit was in charge of it needs to get sacked. 

* This is, to be gentle, a jumbled mess of a movie. It is all over the place. It's mixing up genres as much as it is mixing up locations. This tried to be too much of all things instead of a more solid attempt at one thing. After the 35th different location I was all about done reading text on which new vista we had suddenly traveled to. Didn't care at that point since we wouldn't be staying long enough for it to matter.

* James Wan needs to pull back on the James Wan. The number of quiet moments followed by a fucking explosion were too damn high. It was becoming a joke. Also knowing it's a JW film, the second [the camera panned over with Mera on the boat](https://youtu.be/8xSowfecJz0) I knew a jumpscare was coming. It's a tired cliche and JW uses it like a crutch.

* Momoa and Amber had no chemistry. At all. Amber Heard was all around stiff and just didn't jive with the rest of the cast/movie. Even Nicole Kidman's botox frozen face showed more emotion in her scenes with Arthur's dad. That was more believable than anything between Momoa/Heard. 

* Wasn't a fan of how dumb they wrote Arthur. They gave him a scene to show he's well educated, but then so many other scenes they keep trying to force the he's a dummy thing because they must feel dumb=relatable and they want Aquaman to be relatable! ""*Something something trident*"" You can write a fish out of water character without making them seem like a literal retard. 

In conclusion I would say the movie is beautiful, fun, enjoyable, and the bad parts about it are tolerable. Would give this movie a 6/10. ",a6qh98
ecq4cz2,"Yeah, I think that too much of the movie was wildly swinging and zooming tracking shots as stuff just whizzes around too fast for the human eye to follow.

Really? I felt like this movie was ALL Geoff Johns. Almost every major piece from his New 52 run (Aquaman 'killing' Black Manta's father, the Throne of Atlantis stuff, the Trench, characters like Murk and Nereus, the old king of Atlantis with the special trident etc.) were in the movie. They even included parts that didn't really contribute much to the movie's plot (Aquaman in the desert), presumably because they read it in Johns' run and thought it was cool.",a6qh98
ecszd1g,"> Although Black Manta scenes were limited, he was a badass and owned every scene he was in.

One big con for me is that there wasn't enough Black Manta in the movie. I would've loved to have seen him in the final underwater battle. Also, Arthur was kind of a dick to him and let his father die so his motive is completely justified. Its really hard to hate the guy!  😂",a6qh98

I don't know but it seemed like the whole visual style of the movie was just a bunch of really good ideas that were made without context to eachother? From the armor to the ships to the trchnologies to the soundtrack to the colors used, it is great to focus on one thing (i personally loved the armor design and scoring) but en masse it seems like a cluster of everything. I guess that makes sense during the hub? But the scoring was inconsistent with some tron feeling thingies and other not so much tron feeling thingies.

If these movies are too over the top for you then you’ve obviously never read a DC comic and have no idea what you should be expecting.

ec85vj2,">Dceu need to fix their poor dialogue and writing. Some of the lines were really cheesy and they tried to cram too many storylines

Too many storylines like what? The movie is literally “Dethrone evil brother by obtaining trident that makes you rightful king by law”, like for real how fucking simple do they have to make these movies for you ppl? Even a movie as straightforward and simple as this is getting “Too many storylines” complaints, come on bruh.

As for cheesy dialogue, almost all of it was intentional to fit in with the over the top tone, like “call me ocean master” or “call me black manta”, the movie doesn’t take itself seriously at all so why would you think the dialogue is serious?

Nothing ever happened naturally, forced coincidences led to every advancement in the story (all the way down to the girl randomly giving Mera a Pinocchio book).

I can accept some silly dialogue in a superhero movie but this one really was pushing things. If the movie was otherwise great I'd overlook it, but it's just another layer of low quality writing on top of all of the rest.

It's a shame because so much quality work went into this movie too. Good comedy, good (if overdone) action, and it's just plain fun to look at it. But I can't overlook this level of bad writing.

I know we have to suspend disbelief for stuff like this a little bit, but they didn't even *attempt* to explain this. The only DCEU character that even got namedropped was fucking **Steppenwolf.**

Like, take a five minute meeting with the guys running your half-assed cinematic universe, ask them for a clue as to what Superman might be up to in his next movie, and drop a fucking hint to it. Not only did you resolve the ""why isn't Superman fixing it"" problem, you tied your movies together and gave fans a little teaser. 

Even a hamfisted attempt is better than *nothing.* Have the burly bar comedic relief guys ask if he can get them Batman's autograph, *something* that acknowledges what literally just happened in JL and the fact that you're trying to build a universe (even if you're going about it poorly and in reverse).

The worst thing is, despite some bad dialog, I actually liked the movie enough that my main takeaway was ""why didn't you fucking idiots do this **before Justice League** like everybody with common sense knew you should?""

People like you complain about everything. Can your brain not process more than one thing? The script was simpler than simple, dethrone brother by getting trident, you’re making it sound like Flashpoint and Dark Knight Returns and Kingdom Come and Blackest Night were all jammed into this movie.

You will complain about anything tbh, just stop watching the movies and do something you would rather enjoy. They give you a movie with lots of sub plots like BvS, you hate it, they give you a movie that literally couldn’t be any simpler even if they made it with the knowledge of you being retarded, you still hate it.

The Aquateen portion actually briefly mentioned points I wish they explored further, but the kid's acting butchered any potential for real sentiment. There were no character moments in this movie because almost every conversation was interrupted by an explosion and some bad guys.

The music choices were odd, but one I thought fit well was the track by Sigur Rós at the very beginning. Back when I had hope for this movie. Though I will say that, much later, after I'd given up, I found the scene in which they dive with the flare rather striking, visually.

Thank god for A-List because I would've been upset if this cost me more than the $0 I paid for it. Reminded me of those disposable superhero movies from the mid-2000s.

They didn't take away Thor's winged helmet in the Thor movies, for example, because it ""wouldn't work in live action"" - they took it away because a new designer got to take a crack at Thor and put together a new design that they felt would both look cool and be appropriate for the tone of the movie and the actor portraying the character.

Aquamans dialogue is cheesy at times but it’s script as a whole AND villain are better than thors, whilst it’s score literally curb stomps thors.


Loki was just a whiny little brat jealous of thor, that was his motivation and it was weak imo. Orm had multiple reasons to hate Arthur, he blamed him for their mother’s death and he hated the fact that he was really trying to side with the surface dwellers over Atlantis but even aside from all that his main reason for wanting to strike back at the land was completely justified and reasonable.

I know that even in the comics they address people only seeing him as a joke, and it is annoying when people who know nothing about him just write him off. See: whenever he's mentioned on TBBT or any other mainstream media.

Having said that, I understand the limitations of Aquaman in live action. Since WB didn't want a totally grim-dark adaptation, and since they hired someone fun and charismatic for the role, it's natural for some people to look at it and be like ""Wtf...he talks to fish? What a joke."" The best way to subvert that is to make it tongue-in-cheek. It is, in concept, a silly idea, so leaning into it is probably the best way to go.

The whole film is epic and that final battle was definitely way way way way way better than i'd imagined.  saying the whole film was cheesy is just stupid honestly. most quotes you mention aren't even used in the movie and the one's that are, are well delivered.

&#x200B;

  Another thing i want to talk about is the notion that Manta was underused. He fit perfectly into the narrative, he showed how Orm is willing to do anything to conquer the surface, he was worthy adversary for Arthur. You could feel his determination, he has been perfectly set up to be the main villain in the sequel. He would have been underused if the last place we saw him was when Orm paid him for his last job.

&#x200B;

  I feel like the critics in the U.S just come up with dumb things to complain about as a group and then when they do it together, a lot of ""comic book fans"" start to follow the critics bandwagon. It's ironic because whenever its a marvel film and you check rotten tomatoes, all you see is ""so fun"", ""its super fun"", ""its super funny and fun"", ""every scene is super funny,it doesn't take itself seriously"". Bare in mind, most of all that praise are used to cover up very average films, what surprises me is whenever a DC film tries to be funny in some way, they say DC is copying marvel as though Marvel created comedy.

&#x200B;

i saw the film two days ago here in nigeria and it was really good, its not perfect but its really good. i think so far this year, this film and into the spiderverse have been my favorite and yes, i know Infinity War was also this year.

It's just that the movie was cheesy.  And people are retroactively saying the movie is self-aware of the cheese and doing it on purpose.  Nah, a movie that is self aware of cheese is something like Kung Fu Hustle, Kung Fury, and army of darkness. 

This movie weaved in and out of shit so abruptly its like the editing room kept going flaccid then taking epinephrine shots to the dick then immediately injecting xanax into their balls.  First it felt like i was watching ready player one with synth and all these disorientating visuals, then BOOM, its a rom com with this sabrina the teenage witch music and dialogue.  Then it would turn to avatar, then The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.

Basically, the reason bubbles come out of your mouth when you try and talk under water is because you’re releasing carbon dioxide(a gas) into the water from your lungs which is the by product of respiration. Atlanteans dont use their lungs for breathing underwater and this is shown when Mera uses hydrokinesis to create an air tunnel and trap orm as her and Arthur escape. When he falls on the ground in the tunnel, the first thing he does is vomit water, this means when underwater their lungs and stomach are filled with water to balance the pressure of the outside, it also means they most likely breathe underwater with their skin similar to amphibians, which is why when they talk you don’t see bubbles coming out of their mouths because there is no gas being produced by their lungs.",a6qh98

I've always enjoyed both of those movies pretty well. I went back and watched Phase One before Infinity War (couldn't commit to all three), and The First Avenger might legitimately be my second favorite of those six.



>Aquamans dialogue is cheesy at times but it’s script as a whole AND villain are better than thors,


I had a great time with Aquaman, but I don't think it had scenes like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E3eWjWhaM8) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj4iN-0pu4M). I really like Patrick Wilson, but I think Loki is definitely the better villain. We know Orm's motive, but we never really see it explored. We get something a bit interesting with how he blames Arthur for his mother's death, but overall, his purpose is just to be evil. Loki is actually really similar to Arthur on paper, and there's a lot of nuance to him. He's an outsider meant to unite two worlds who loves his family, but ultimately isn't accepted by his kingdom and must prove himself. I could argue that Loki going down the ""dark"" path made him even more interesting than Arthur, seeing him doubt himself as he betrays all of his family to do what is ""right"".



>whilst it’s score literally curb stomps thors.


Aquaman's score is more in the style of Ragnarok than the first Thor, so it's difficult to directly compare them, but ""curb stomp"" seems to imply that Thor has a bad score, which is not the case. In my opinion, it's one of the best in the MCU. *Earth to Asgard* is worth a listen at the least.



>Loki was just a whiny little brat jealous of thor, that was his motivation and it was weak imo. Orm had multiple reasons to hate Arthur, he blamed him for their mother’s death and he hated the fact that he was really trying to side with the surface dwellers over Atlantis but even aside from all that his main reason for wanting to strike back at the land was completely justified and reasonable. They’ve polluted his home for years, killing sea life and inhabitants of Atlantis and it’s time to take action. That’s my take on it at least. The best part of thor was leaving the theatre when the credits rolled.

It was very cool to me to see how other Atlanteans developed after the collapse. The Fishermen turned into Mermaids/(MERMAN!), the Brine giant crab things, The Trench are “nothing but animals”, and so on. 

In BP, the other tribes were okay, nothing cool or distinct about them (to me that is) and I feel as if they didn’t play as important a role. In Aquaman, 4/7 kingdoms were needed for Orm to get the title Ocean Master so he could invade the surface world. Orm was okay strong arming other kingdoms into this, hence the final battle. 

Now that I mention the final battle, the battle between Xebel, the Fisherman,  and Atlantis again the Brine blows the final “battle” of BP outta the water. BP had about 15 people running around in cloaks fighting each other.

The writing was overwhelmingly mediocre (I don’t normally have a problem with plot holes/inconsistencies but this movie had so many that stood out like a sore thumb), the villains felt criminally (heh) underdeveloped and lacked any sort of characters arcs... really now that I’m thinking about it I don’t think anyone in the movie had any kind of arc. Mamoa, the god damn protagonist, goes from a dude who doesn’t want to and shouldn’t be a king to a dude who still doesn’t want to and still shouldn’t be the king, but is because he found the Master Sword or whatever. He doesn’t change at all, his outrageously generic copy paste over sexualized love interest doesn’t change at all and is only there for Mamoa to kiss at the end... Like I said I wish I could see what you see, but on my end the movie is completely devoid of any decent writing. 

It’s funny you bring up worldbuilding too, as it’s one of the aspects of the movie that frustrated me most. We get a small exposition dump towards the beginning of the movie, but past that there’s literally nothing. No insight into the way Atlantian’s live their life, no insight into how the society is structured, and even less insight into any of the other sea kingdoms. They could have easily kept Aquaman underwater the whole movie and actually explored literally anything they set up, but nah he has to go on some Indiana Jones rip off romp through the desert with The Little Mermaid while Pitbull sings Africa by Toto in the background (or generic sit com music? I have no idea what happened there. Also a little side tangent that kinda expands on my point - after just stumbling through the desert for a bit they fall through the whole to this ancient society they were looking for... and it just so happens that they manage to catch themselves and pull them up to the exact area they need to be, despite the location looking absolutely massive. They could have spent some time exploring these old ruins, doing some world building explaining their history... but nah, they land right where they need to be and do exactly what they need to do before peacing out off screen). Those fish people show up for like two scenes, the first in which the king is killed (who is he? Is he well liked by his people? Who are his people, how do they live, where do they live? There’s no establishing shots or anything, just a straight cut to a generic cgi show room where they quickly progess the plot and move on) and then the second is his daughter just kind of... being in the battle. It’s like they meant to develop her character so it would make sense for her to be featured there, but they just didn’t. We don’t even know her name, stop putting the camera on her Wan no one cares. Those crustaceans at the end are even worse, they only show up in one scene despite being one of the main forces in the climatic war battle. Again, we get no insight into their culture, into their thoughts and motivations, into their cities... nothing. They’re just a plot device, like pretty much everyone in this movie. And it’s such a shame too, because a lot of what they set up is actually interesting. I would love to see how a bunch of sentient underwater crab-people live, or the fish people, or even just the generic human-but-underwater kingdom. Shit, explore that pirate society thing they set up with the completely pointless secondary villain. But they just don’t do anything with it. I don’t know shit about Atlantis past it’s generic DC backstory. For my money both TFA and especially TLJ wipe the board with it when it comes to world building, and those movies aren’t really even focused on world building at all. The universe is just a backdrop for stories to be told in, where as with Aquaman the story is actually *about* Atlantis and they hardly spend 15 minutes there. 

On humour... idk man, personally the only time I laughed during the movie was during was during the pitbull scene, and when the fish princess was floating on the water in her dumb little water pod thing (im cracking up just thinking about it tbh) but with both of those cases I don’t think I was laughing *with* the movie. I’ve seen the film twice now and the only attempted joke I can actually remember is the one where Ariel is like “wow Mamoa you’re stinky” and Mamoa is like “no I’m not.. oh yes I am”, and that just sticks out due to how far that joke missed. 

Visually the only scenes that stuck out to me was the boat/diving scene, which was admittedly pretty sick, the ancient society below the desert which we hardly see any of, and the big flood which ultimately doesn’t play into the plot at all aside from getting Aquaman to go do the movie stuff. Like really, you’d think maybe the world governments would be freaking out about this, there would probably be a lot of real world consequences to it. But the movie just totally forgets about it, which kind of sours the scene in hindsight. Atlantis is just generic cgi sci fi city but with turtles. Compared to TLJ it just doesn’t compete imo. Nothing took my breath away like the ramming sequence, nothing captivated me as much as the throne room fight or the absolutely gorgeous sequence on Crait (seriously the artist behind that planets design is my favourite person). Hell, even Canto Blight is beautiful, with a grounded and consistent aesthetic throughout that matches up with the world building and themes surrounding the city/scene. It really does look like the type of place a bunch of space war profiteers would go to have a fun time. 

Honestly I’m not the biggest fan of TFA, it’s a fun ride but is 100% “Star Wars, but this time by JJ Abrams”. It’s still a much better movie than Aquaman imo, but it’s lacking in ambition and set up the OT on a pretty boring course. But then TLJ comes along and actually manages to do something interesting with the generic set up. The movie as a whole feels unique in its franchise, the character arcs are handled beautifully and go in directions not very many other movies do, which brings up a lot of questions regarding how we think of the typical heroes journey. Luke in particular is just fantastic, they could have gone the lazy route and had him show up with a laser sword and win the day for everyone, but luckily they didn’t. Instead he’s a very real person, his past experiences in the OT impacted him and that shows. There was no “happily ever after” for Luke and the gang past RotJ, because that’s just not how it works. They’re still people, they still grow and change, and they still make mistakes. We find Luke a broken old man, and see his growth in the film as he remembers that the universe is worth fighting for, and in the last moments of his (physical) life he is that young Luke we knew from the OT again, but with the wisdom and experience that comes with age. Reflecting what he said earlier in the movie, he actually does walk out with a lightsaber and face down the whole first order, and he does it without even being there! It’s just so fucking cool, and is exactly what I want to see from the Jedi (not some videogamey over-choreographed warriors like we got in the PT). He has his moment of redemption, his last heroic stand, before he parts with the physical world allowing the new, better generation of Jedi to begin. It’s beautiful, it’s interesting, and it ties directly into the movies central theme of moving forward to the future while learning from our past. And that’s just one character arc. I might say Kylo’s is even better, but his isn’t finished quite yet. 

I could go on and on about this shit, but I’ll try cut it off here lol. It’s not a perfect movie, but TLJ is a creative film with something to say, and on the whole I think it pulls it off really well. It gave me everything I wanted out of a SW film (fun space action, cool planets and ships, sick Jedi shenanigans) and then a lot more on top of that. It’s not perfectly executed, but you can tell there’s a deep desire by those involved to tell a unique and thought provoking story in what could have just been a generic popcorn movie. There’s a strong artistic vision behind the project, even if Disney is just pumping it out for the money those involved in the project seem to really care. In comparison Aquaman just feels like a blend of generic action movie tropes designed to be as marketable and profitable as possible. There’s just no passion, no originality, no identity. It’s a product designed to make bank, and it really shows. It’s another Fast and Furious, another Transformers, another Venom. Normally I can still find enjoyment in those types of films, but with Aquaman I really just wanted it to be good. I wanted to learn about the world, I wanted to see actual character growth, I wanted to see an original narrative. But I didn’t get any of that, and it makes the experience too frustrating for me to just turn my brain off and enjoy the wildly outrageous ride it is. 

Sorry to launch off on such a tangent, and apologies if I came off as a dick at all. Like I said it’s just a frustrating movie for me, but at the end of the day it’s all opinions and I’m glad you were able to enjoy it more than I did.

And we’re not even talking about the fact that Justice League barely cracked the top 10 highest grossing films of last year (actually could be wrong on that, Last Jedi may have ended up pushing it out but I’m too lazy to look it up). In fact, JL *lost Warner Bros. money.* If you had told anyone 20 years ago that a Justice League movie would do that, you would have been laughed at. That alone should tell you either how mishandled things are at DC when it comes to keeping a low(er) overhead — the damn thing cost 600 mil to make — or that there is a general lack of enthusiasm among audiences for the way they’ve handled their roster of heroes.

And when we talk about “nothing to write home about in terms of quality”.... you did *see* JL, right? Suicide Squad? BvS? Dude, you have no argument there. But just to show you I’m not biased, I love the shit out of Man of Steel. It is a great fucking film, warts and all.

Also, not sure where you’re getting your figures for HP. The MCU has a running total of about 15 billion, which is not “a few” more. It’s almost twice that, but okay. Regardless, my point about Marvel establishing the number 1 film franchise still stands, whether you like it or not.",a6qh98

This isn’t like ppl complaint about how Bruce got to Gotham from the desert in TDKR at at all because in that movie, Gotham was under heavy surveillance from all angles by bane, so it was something that went against the plot and kind of mad it idiotic when Bruce just showed up in gotham.


For your second sentence, Batman in the DCEU has tech the government can only dream of getting, so what? Manta built the ship himself or stole a prototype from somewhere and worked on it,big deal?

Btw, when manta attacks the atlanteans they are close to the surface of the water(Nereus asks orm why they’re having the meeting so close to the surface then orm uses the excuse of meeting at the former kings court).

Your third point, Manta and his crew held the entire crew hostage which was obviously preventing them from sending a distress signal, Manta killed the Captain because he’s a fucking pirate and the captain was talking back at him(I’ve forgotten what he said), he did it to assert a position of power and they abandoned the sub because Mantas dad destroyed it with a grenade.

His birth world is starting to get directly involved in the world he was actually raised in, and even though he feels indifferent towards that world, the blossoms of a relationship that was ""forbidden"" like his parents' start to make him feel re-connected. This leads to him being the bridge between two worlds, and the start of a new balance between the two. (Ideally) It is refreshing that they didn't have him and Mera instantly fall in love also. This happens way too often in movies. In this one, at least she is a connection to his birth-world. I'm not saying any of this was done perfectly by any means, but it has everything you need, just not explained in boring dialogue.

It's same way that a person with a diseased lung and a bad heart isn't a bad person. Certain parts do not change the essence of the whole item.

Man of Steel was a mediocre movie with well done CGI and clearly visible action, Does that make it an objectively better action movie than Black Panther?

I’m not talking about Thor’s many films after or GOTG’s sequel (although we could and I’d have more to say there, but I’m keeping it simple because I feel this is the only argument I need to make my point).

As far as your SS/Hulk comparison, sure, you could pit a supervillain team-up film featuring the Joker (which you somehow neglected to mention), released at the time of peak superhero movie popularity, against only the 2nd MCU film, after a Hulk movie had already been released and critically and commercially panned, and before this whole MCU/DCEU debate ever really heated up... but would that be a fair comparison? Which actually further serves my argument, if we’re being honest... Wonder Woman, a film that was *also* released at time of peak superhero popularity, only pulls in 50mil over one of Marvel’s C-list properties released 3 years prior? Dude, I hate to sound like a broken record, but come on, that is a *big deal,* and just because you refuse to acknowledge the implications of that doesn’t make it any less so.

Only two of them passed $500M (Spider-Man 3 and Iron Man). In 2008, the MCU began and The Dark Knight Trilogy arguably hit its peak. Between 2008 and 2012, 10 DC/Marvel movies were released, and only one passed $500M (Iron Man 2). In 2012, The Dark Knight Rises did roughly the same numbers as The Dark Knight, not necessarily making more or less of an impact. Meanwhile, The Avengers became the highest grossing superhero movie of all time, and it did so by over $500M.


18 DC/Marvel movies came out from 2012-2016, almost double what came out in the same span between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. Only two of them *didn't* cross $500M (The Wolverine and Fant4stic), and three of them passed $1B (Iron Man 3, Age of Ultron, and Civil War).


I think it's safe to say that The Avengers caused a *considerable* growth in popularity for the genre, and it's only continued to grow since then. So yeah, there's really no basis for comparing the box office of six Marvel movies that came out between 2008 and 2012 to six DC movies that came out between 2013 and 2018.

>Transformers 3 and 4 are the highest grossing,

This really isn't comparable. The originals came out almost 40 years ago, and the sequel trilogy is already seeing a decline, with a $700M drop between Episodes 7 and 8. With or without inflation, Solo is the lowest grossing movie in the franchise.

Every Hobbit movie went down, with none passing Return of the King. Every original Alien movie declined. The last Hunger Games was the lowest grossing. 1/7 of the original Halloween movies passed the original. Neither Ghostbusters sequel passed the original. 2/11 of the Friday the 13th sequels have grossed more than the original. Every original Planet of the Apes movie declined. Every Ocean's movie declined. The last Die Hard movie went down from 3 and 4.

I'm sure they saw it as motivation to make more Batman movies with some Superman thrown in there. Green Lantern flopping the year before The Avengers probably didn't make them too crazy about doing Wonder Woman or Aquaman either.

I was never trying to make this a ""Who did it first"" discussion, but I'm willing to talk about it.


The DCAU was and still is great, but animated TV is far from live action movies. If we're making this discussion about all mediums, Marvel was technically the first to do a comic crossover, with the Human Torch meeting the Sub Mariner in 1940. Guess who followed later that year?
