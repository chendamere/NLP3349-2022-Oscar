ekotezu,Just here to point out the original story was a One Direction Fan Fiction.,bc0mfw
ekpc2fm,Hardin gave off a real Aniken Skywalker vibe.,bc0mfw
ekotn8s,"The after series started as one direction fan fiction. The source material is very rinse and repeat and this movie is not much different. The acting is sub-par, with no emotional connection between the leads. They had to fast track so many moment from the book to cram it into a movie that the characters move too fast to make sense, even as young adults making poor decisions. All the crazy conflict from the book is no where to be found in the film, deflating it even further.

2/10, would never watch this movie again. I‚Äôm not saying that to be mean either, it just makes no sense to make such an expansive fan fiction into a film like this. In my eyes, it was never going to work. 

I don‚Äôt recommend the books either.",bc0mfw
ekphegx,"I think there's nothing inherently wrong with fan fiction - it's fictional characters put in alternative fictional universes, nobody gets hurt and it's a ton of fun.  
I personally don't know any fanfics that are legitimately great (send them to me if you have some), but there's nothing saying that can't be.  

But I feel that fanfics about an actual person cross some line.  

Even if we all know that they intentionally created a persona as part of the band, so the Harry Styles this is written about is almost as fictional as Edward from Twilight, it is still very creepy to me.

Like writing and publishing entire sex scenes where one of the people is an actual living person who didn't consent to being in this story has to feel wrong, right?

I guess it's not very different than what tabloids are doing, but everyone hates them.",bc0mfw
el0a7lh,Watched it yesterday with my gf and man we both hated so much this is by far the worst movie i went to watch in theaters,bc0mfw
elbes6w,"My girlfriend and I both enjoy Harry Styles, and I guess she read this fanfiction back in middle school? We thought it‚Äôd be funny to watch this, like a ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs good‚Äù kind of thing. Turns out it‚Äôs just aggressively mediocre and extremely boring. It just kinda sucks. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend even as a joke.",bc0mfw
elr5k2v,I just don't get why Hardin didn't call off the bet when he was falling in love with Tessa? Like if he loved her why did he still show his friends the condom and the bloody sheets?,bc0mfw
ekt3674,"Haven‚Äôt seen, I just have a question. Is the relationship in the movie as toxic and abusive as it is in the books? I read them when I was about thirteen.",bc0mfw
ekq0nze,"Why does that movie still have no RT score? It opened in over 2000 theatres, there should normally be some reviews for it.

EDIT: 
There are already some reviews on RT, all rotten at the moment: RT score 0%

Metacritic score: 31",bc0mfw
ektlrpb,at my theater this sells pretty fucking well why is it so dead here,bc0mfw
ele954v,"This movie is just terrible! I read the books last month because I wanted to go see the movie and I was really disappointed. They messed up everything in the book! All the details that make it something have been put aside, the movie is completely rushed and does not make any sense .... It's just sad how Anna Todd sells for half a dozen dollars!",bc0mfw
eljav1v,"Honestly, I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. I came in with pretty low expectations and was... left feeling disappointed? The plot was as I expected it to be, much too rushed. Their relationship forms too quickly and not organically in the slightest. They told each other very intimate details of their lives far too quickly and they moved in with each other far too fast. The two lead actors had okay chemistry and aside from the atrocious British accent, there wasn't anything that really pissed me off about the acting. The girl could play the nerdy virgin and the dude could play the bad boy with a ""deep side"" (hint hint, drinking problems and daddy issues). There was a toxic relationship that gets really played down. Harding beats up one of their mutual friends for attempting to kiss her though they're not even dating and it struck me as very possessive. After the ""big reveal"" I just lost all hope. In all honesty, it was a bit surprising that Tessa would go back to Harding, but then I remembered, it was adapted from a Wattpad fan fiction. I've read many a Wattpad fanfic in my younger years and this was the same unoriginal plot and toxic relationship. Don't come to this movie with high expectations. My friends and I spent our time ragging on the movie which was pretty fun.",bc0mfw
ekwak0b,"I‚Äôm a guy who usually enjoys all kinds of romance, and despite knowing the origins of After (fan fiction and the book) I didn‚Äôt know what the film would be about. Personally, I don‚Äôt find anything wrong with it except that it is kinda boring, nothing really interesting happens and the relation between the two mains is very mundane. I don‚Äôt see why you would put that into a film, if the guy was more of a mess or even violent it would have given some depth.

Went to see it with me mum and being a 50 Shades of Grey fan, she said she liked After better. So if you liked 50 Shades, you heard me mum.",bc0mfw
ex2vmfi,"I read these books a long time ago.. i got completely sucked in for some mad reason. So when i saw the  movie pop up on Netflix, I just had to watch it. I think the movie was a healthier way of portraying the relationship, which was good idea.  But one thing that drove me absolutely crazy was the fact that Hero FT kept his eyes open during a lot of the kissing scenes which I found sooo weird. I copped it from the lake scene and numerous kissing scenes!! How on earth was it not said to him when they were filming???",bc0mfw
ewqvtb0,"i‚Äôm just rlly looking forward to awc , i think we are gonna see a lot more of the book hardin that we all love! and adore",bc0mfw
ewqvv1g,also they had to make it pg 13 which made their relationship look like a semi healthy relationship but in awc i think they‚Äôre gonna be a lot more book hessa scenes that we all love and need!!!!,bc0mfw
hxyrzr1,"i know this is old now, but I am just getting to watch these. can someone explain to me if Tessa loses her virginity in the scene she comforts Hardin in his house after he destroys things in a drunken rage? I feel like they first have sex after his dads wedding, but they fooled around earlier in the movie too, and it wasn‚Äôt obvious if they had sex there.",bc0mfw
ekpr6kx,[I listened to a review of the novel](http://www.frowl.org/worstbestsellers/episode-119-after/) and the author apparently had no idea how college worked because it's treated like high school in the book. Which makes sense because I'm pretty sure the author was in high school when she wrote it.,bc0mfw
ekotis7,it also reads like a sex crimes playbook.,bc0mfw
ekotvog,Glad to hear this is terrible. Made my night. Hoping for worse ratings that Hellboy here!,bc0mfw
ekyuki5,"Unpopular opinion here but I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again when it's released.  I don't think it would be a good movie for someone to watch that hasn't read the books. Granted, the movie is very mild compared to the books, but I think they did an ok job portraying the characters.

I think the movies layout was like that to introduce the characters to people that haven't read the books. I think if it gets approved for another movie that the 2nd installment will have more meat in it.
 
If you liked fifty shades of grey, twilight, or anything with that sort of ""bad boy,"" ""good girl"" vibe, then you will enjoy the series.",bc0mfw
ekq24td,"I agree. But I'm guessing people take it in the same vein as shows or movies that have actual actors playing them. Like are the writers really thinking about iron man and captain America in a romantic relationship or are they actually thinking about the actors. 

I don't know, rambling.",bc0mfw
elt9awy,Wait where was that in the movie ? I saw it twice and I missed that,bc0mfw
iujvnm2,I personally think that he was trying to fight that he loved her and this it was a form of self sabotage. He didn‚Äôt think he deserved Tessa and he didn‚Äôt want to admit to his feelings for her so he was being a childish asshole.,bc0mfw
ekuv3fo,"It‚Äôs WAY I mean WAY more toxic in the books. 
I‚Äôve read the After books on wattpad and what you see in the movie is like 1/10th of what‚Äôs in the books.",bc0mfw
ektc08f,Haven't read the books but the relationship in the movie is definitely toxic. This one of the most regressive romance films I've ever seen.,bc0mfw
ekqcrbk,RT 14%,bc0mfw
ektqnki,I don't think /r/movies is the audience for after.,bc0mfw
el0tlai,It's been mostly empty in my theater.,bc0mfw
eth0ws0,lollll at ur dislike of his accent bc he‚Äôs actually English and that‚Äôs his real accent üòÇ,bc0mfw
hip5otd,I read somewhere recently that he gave an interview (still haven't seen which one though) that Hardin esp at the lake was confused as to what his feelings were while he kissed her. He knew something was changing and he couldn't pinpoint it just yet. As if his heart and head weren't on the same page yet.,bc0mfw
ekqgdgr,"The novel (can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs allowed to be called that) is truly nothing worth spending time on. The prose is horrible, and it‚Äôs quite obvious it was not meant to go further than Wattpad. How it got all the way here to a movie, I‚Äôll never understand. 

The two characters basically meet each other, find ‚Äúlove‚Äù that is heinously embedded with deceit and lies and awful communication skills, interlaced with a ton of gratuitous sex scenes... which is probably the only reason it got published since 50 shades paved the way (equally badly written). 

Just to give you an idea, the first novel is 875 pages as an e-book (amazon says 592 for paperback). Why... how...",bc0mfw
ekpyivs,"You wish that the author would have written that fan fiction when she was in high school. At least it would explain why it is so bad. But the author was actually a grown adult obsessed with One Direction when she wrote it lol.

Fan fiction doesn't have to be automatically bad. There are some really good ones as well by really talented people (and I guess some of those would make for decent movies). But the fan fiction After that was later published as a book series is bad, really bad. It was inspired by 50 Shades of Grey btw.",bc0mfw
ekotsdi,Oh boy my favorite type of thing to watch /s,bc0mfw
ekovf27,"Did you see hellboy yet? I just glanced at the discussion post and those ratings are scary! This movie will get their demographics‚Äô votes; there were a bunch of teenage girls in the theater and one of the showings tonight was even sold out (wtf). I haven‚Äôt looked into hellboy too much though, so I‚Äôll be interested to see how it all plays out.",bc0mfw
emjgara,They're referencing the book.,bc0mfw
el9nsps,"haven't read the story, how is the relationship toxic? is it just a highschool kid's misguided thoughts about what's romantic?",bc0mfw
ekuhdzg,"Believe it or not, it's more toxic in the books :\\",bc0mfw
ekqdr73,"Just saw the added fresh review. Although, reading it I think the reviewer could have accidentally clicked the ""fresh"" button because the review is scathing concerning the movie and  Hero Fiennes Tiffin's acting performance.",bc0mfw
elunwc2,"I always wonder about this thread, it's demographics, and what seems to resonate with users here.  I would say that any sort of artsy foreign film, Fifty Shades, or based-off-teen-book story is not going to warrant much of a discussion.",bc0mfw
elvi6c7,"My theater didn‚Äôt even show it. They‚Äôve had all kinds of weird stuff before, but it seems they wanted nothing to do with this garbage.",bc0mfw
eth79yf,oh shit seriously?,bc0mfw
ekuap3z,It's funny because 5O shades of Grey started out as fan fiction for the writer E. L. James she took Twilight and just used Bella and Edward and added all of the BDSM and ran with it. I read the story on wattpad it will never be the next great American novel but if you want to kill some time and bored it will do. The movie as always is never as good then a actual book no matter if that book is amazing or terrible or like this one so so. There isn't to many great many novels out there but hey you can escape and kill some time with this why not right! There is worse out there!!,bc0mfw
el9s4lw,"Harry (Hardin) in the books does a couple of things that make him a completely terrible person. 

So I‚Äôm gonna give spoilers. Basically the first After book is entirely about the bet. The bet being, which one of us can sleep w Tessa first. So to prove to his friends that _he_ won, he keeps the sheets they had sex on, the _bloody_ sheets and stuffs them in his car trunk to hide them from Tessa. She finds them later on. 

The second thing I remember him doing is he‚Äôs protective of Tessa and doesn‚Äôt like it when guys talk to her. He‚Äôs _that_ guy. And when I say, he doesn‚Äôt like it, I mean he fights these guys and then flips out on Tessa calling her a slut and bitch and then says something like, oh I bet you wanted him to fuck you so badly. 

Also he‚Äôs protective of her virginity, and not like, ‚Äúoh I want you to wait bc I want you to do this only when you‚Äôre ready and you‚Äôve met the right one.‚Äù type of protective. He‚Äôs protective in the sense that he thinks once she‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen fucked‚Äù (his words) she‚Äôll mean less and be used. 


Also a HUGE thing in the Wattpad books that a lot of people hated was, whenever they‚Äôd fight, whether it was a small argument or a bad one, like things being thrown and smashed, they‚Äôd always make up by having sex. And it was always Harry who made the first move. And Tessa is stupid for not seeing through what he was doing. And this fight-then-sex thing happens throughout all the books. He started this cycle, and Tessa was roped in. Classic abuse. 


There are other things but they‚Äôre not coming to mind right now. But Harry was a total shitshow of a character. Although I liked the books lmao bc you knew the characters WERENT going to do the right thing lol. Like so many things could have easily been avoided or handled in a better way, yet the two main characters really decide to make things extremely difficult for themselves.

Honestly it‚Äôs not worth reading at all.


He also lies a lot and just blames her for everything. But she still ends up falling in love w him hahaha",bc0mfw
ethcuu3,"üòÇüòÇ yes, do a quick google search.  i think he‚Äôs actually related to the actor who plays voldemort and had a small role in the movie too",bc0mfw
ela510d,My god the book seems to tick all the requirements of a wattpad story lmao. Probably wise to tone it down for the movie,bc0mfw
exf6yaq,ralph fiennes is his uncle lol.,bc0mfw
eluo8ko,"Or maybe they shouldn't have and made it harsh as the book?  Seems to me that making more of a controversial film would have helped make it a few extra dollars.  The way it's advertised, it seems so average.",bc0mfw
ela6m2k,"Yeah they did! By a lot, which I was expecting bc the trailers seemed really relaxed compared to the books. 

And also the movie only shares what happened in the first After book so I‚Äôm hoping they don‚Äôt make a second After movie. There‚Äôs like 3 or 4 books total.",bc0mfw
