gu3p4lc,The music was really something,mnwmd5
gu3m0sw,Thought this movie was fantastic. Reminded me of Uncut Gems but with just a completely different setting and scale. Gasped a few times as complications were piled on (getting the phone back was brilliant!). Kinda want to rewatch it just to soak in the tension.,mnwmd5
gvvm6ie,"Shiva Baby is a GREAT debut! Shows some everyday realities of being female, college-aged, and belonging to a “liberal”-minded, but still quite overwhelming, Jewish family niche in the modern world. And I think it shows the insular world of this particular tiny slice of humanity—Jewish-American college girls, so well. 

Even small, very subtle details, like, for instance, Danielle’s straightened hair at the beginning of the movie with Max, vs her natural hair, for the rest of it, are a punch. Straightening hair (read: damaging hair) is a rite of passage  in “coastal elite Jewish-American girl” culture. Many Jewish girls have naturally curly, unruly hair, coming into conflict with what society, especially younger society, thinks female hair should look like. The fact that Danielle had specifically straightened her hair for her sugar daddy date already shows me her mentality: nobody wants a sugar baby with curly, “unsexy,” “Jew” hair. It tells me that Danielle is the type of girl who desperately wants to feel beautiful, and is also the type to conform to society’s standards in order to do so.  All that, and more, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. 

To paraphrase Jon Frosch from Hollywood Reporter, it ain’t “The Hours”-deep, nor is it prolly really meant to be, as a comedic horror movie. Notwithstanding, really enjoyed the nuanced ways the movie brought up different themes, even if it didn’t explore them as much as I’d have liked to see. And it does play on stereotypes quite a lot. But, in the end, the actors are so great in their stereotyped roles, you’re left remembering your own “shiva baby-like” family encounter, no matter if you pronounce it “rugelach” or “arugula.”",mnwmd5

Great film though.",mnwmd5
guafpsn,The best way I could pitch this film is that it's Noah Baumbach meets the Safdie Brothers with the Judaism somehow doubled.,mnwmd5
gu0tmtf,"Pretty great actually. My only complaint would be the compositions are so whacky, floaty and hand held that sort of diminish the effort a bit as a whole. I know they are thematically tied to the anxiety inducing vibe, but I've been noticing that a lot of filmmakers utilise the technique in many new films, basically for the same reasons, and I'd argue that there are other much more exciting ways to convey chaos through composition. 

There's certainly an argument to be had that there isn't a single memorable shot in the film, and, considering we are talking about the cinematic medium, that's a little unfair to an otherwise great story, with focused performances.",mnwmd5
gu091ze,"Enjoyable quick film, funny and cringe. Felt old when they referred to  Dianna Agron as old lol",mnwmd5
gu0ko81,Super good dialogue. A bit of it hit a little close to him so I don’t see myself watching again. Some of the camera work was really shaky especially in the beginning. But the main actress was fantastic.,mnwmd5
gu1gld3,"I know this movie is getting heavy praise particularly for it's bisexual representation, but for me, I loved it for it's Jewish-American representation. Just everything about it perfectly captured the vibe I always feel at extended family events that I don't really wanna be at because I barely know anyone.

Everything from the decor of the house to the food on the table brought back memories for me, and the whole ""Jewish family gathering edited as a horror movie"" really felt relatable.",mnwmd5
gu0dfco,">""*Did I say this was a love story? No. It's a horror movie*."" - **Deadpool**

This film is as chaotic and stress inducing as '**mother!**' minus the supernatural fantasy elements and metaphors. Cringe, but in a deliberately fun way.",mnwmd5
gul736i,"I see it described everywhere as a young woman encounters her ""sugar daddy"" at a shiva. Even since the short film that had been the pitch.

But is there any setup for it actually being a ""sugar baby"" type scenario? It just seems like she is a prostitute and he is a client.",mnwmd5
gu4hmzv,That was great. Not many movies can pull off the couple of hour time frame without feeling forced. Good acting and good direction. Mazel tov!,mnwmd5
gx1m6ny,"Thoroughly enjoyed it, the dialogue was very Baumbach-esque. The entire movie felt like Mother! meets Frances Ha",mnwmd5
h2c04h2,As a neat freak person this film was agonising to watch. No personal space.. everyone needed a good shower.. I wanted to go out and get some air. Made me appreciate my not so close ties with my family. Good movie indeed,mnwmd5
gu13r6r,"I don't think I've seen a movie that so accurately reflected my own personal anxieties of growing into adulthood than this. All those expectations of family and even family acquaintances and feeling like all you're going to do is disappoint them. I love how the director was going to take what in other instances would feel like a result of a small budget with the really tight handheld camera and make it a stylistic choice that adds to that stressful tone of the movie. 

I'm glad this seems to be getting such a warm reception cause I really want Emma Seligman to have the opportunity to make more stuff like this that has such a strong sense of purpose and voice.",mnwmd5
h3qlu55,"It was a great movie but one part has me baffled. What was Kim going to give Danielle when she asked her to hold the child. Apparently it seemed important because she didn't want max to have the child either. Kim gave her back her phone. I assume Kim saw her sugar daddy business popped up on the phone also, so was she going to assist her? Give her tips? I'm really surprised that scene didn't continue.

Any suggestions?",mnwmd5
gvjqflm,"Another great social anxiety simulator. Not quite on the level of 'mother!, but close at times. Just loved the performances and the constant escalation.",mnwmd5

gu8xujk,She really didn't look that skinny,mnwmd5
hmhoxr0,"For me, this was just a movie about an immature spoiled girl and her obnoxious family, where almost every character seemed like nothing more than a caricature of a hypocritical old person. It seems to me that our generation is unable to see any virtue whatsoever in anyone who isn't young, while at the same time we have a very hard time coping with early adulthood problems, and what baffles me is that we can't link those two things, which are obviously related. We complain when older people doesn't live to our moral expectations (which are mainly about minorities and gender or sexual behaviour). And when they are progressive enough (which is rare) we continue digging to find reasons to condemn them. It almost looks like, since we're unable to mature, get things done, or contribute in any way (and yes, it's very frustrating to grow up in this never ending economic and political crisis, I feel it too), we satisfy ourselves criticizing them. At the same time we are mainly concerned with moral issues but, since youth is a time of discoveries and mistakes, we are creating a social environment that entraps us and makes us feel impotent and opressed, since we are always vigilating ourselves and others and measuring everybody with our orthodox moral compass (which is absurdily opened about some things, like exchanging sex and atention for money - and considering it power!).

Now, about the movie *per se*: for me, the plot in istself is unable to create real tension and has nothing of a horror atmosphere outside the perspective of a young insecure and anxious girl who is struggling to position herself inside an institution that is bigger and older than her (her family) in part, because she is egocentric. But in order to put us in her perspective, the movie uses the chaotic rhythm of its montage and soundtrack, and also an overwhelming amount of close ups, since the plot and dialogues are unable to do it, and I felt like it was trying to fool me the whole time. Well, it didn't. The plot, the dialogues and the characters, in my opinion, all lacked strenght, so the movie thies to compensate it with cheap tricks.

Sorry, but I'm just being earnest.",mnwmd5
h18oyzg,Joel is an idiot. That is all.,mnwmd5
guje5yp,"In my opinon this is Gen Z's  The Graduate   a movie about a young  lost generation just becoming adults, They want to belive their mature and can handle life, but they can't yet. 

As a 20 year old this movie spoke me, I want to be an independence and want to be treated like an adult, and believe that i can handle things, but i can't. Particularly her relationship with her parents who still view her as a high schooler and do to circumstances are still financially supporting her.",mnwmd5
gu1dtt8,I kind of enjoyed it but it felt like the script was almost unfinished in a way. The different plot threads and the character arc could have been done better I think.,mnwmd5
h1pb5m6,"Omg this film was a wild ride and I loved it. I was truly beside myself in the theatre just absorbing allll the cringe and piping hot drama. The music was very fitting, the movie carries a lot of psychological horror energy. 

One of those great experiences where you just don't want to blink and miss anything. Transfixing and extremely entertaining to watch!",mnwmd5
gu72b3j,"Honestly, my inclination is to recommend you just watch Transparent instead.

The sense of dread and anxiety was there throughout, but it was bred amongst this backdrop of older Jewish characters, who honestly felt like one-dimensional tropes to me. 

Every non-millenial character in this film was a walking inquistor, who's only purpose at this Shiva was to enquire into the private and professional lives of the millenial guests, mainly the protagonist. Yes, i know - Jewish, Greek, Italian or whatever elders are meant to be intrusive and pushy, but this film just over-did it for me, none of them had an ounce of social awareness, empathy or restraint - it was just unrealistic as part of a film that i thought was seeking to be grounded in relatability. 

Maybe they were meant to be zombified, as if this were a horror film where we're meant to fear what ever corner you turn, you're going to get asked about your career, and if so, that's fine - it works on that level. However, If it's meant to be a realistic look at social dynamics from within Jewish communities, as i said - Transparent does a much better job, it just feels much more reflective of actual lived experiences, rather than just treating the Jewish boomers with disdain off the bat, potraying them as one-dimensional enquiry machines immediately. Transparent treats them as real people, with their own lives they spend their time worrying about. After all, whilst we may have anxiety about the odd remark made about our love-life or career amongst family, you'd have to be pretty narcissistic to assume you would be anywhere near as central to the lives of the every single person at this Shiva, as Rachel Sennot's character is. 

I think my issue is Rachel Sennot's character feels like the only actual character here, and rather than surrounding her with fully formed antagonists, she is surrounded by a selection of lazy Jewish caricatures, that whilst may ring true to some, are essentially stereotypes, stereotypes that exist in a few people you may encounter at a Shiva or Sabbath, but to portray Jewish events as being dominated by them.....eh, it just leaves a sour taste, it's a falsification that only serves to re-enforce to non-Jews that this is what 'we're like'. 

I now understand why My Big Fat Greek Wedding must have sucked for a lot of Greek people, when portraying a minority group, you should do so with nuance, not as a a uniform group who all adhere to one characteristic, which in this film is intrusion.",mnwmd5

guafkx8,"I found the cinematography really effective though, so I can't really discount it because it didn't have memorable compositions. The way it keeps you in Danielle's mind is fantastic, and I think the shots at the end of everyone packed in the van are actually quite memorable. There isn't anything screensaver worthy, but the cinematography was clearly aiming more for effect than visual strength, which I think was beneficial for the film.",mnwmd5

gvke19d,">  I loved it for it's Jewish-American representation

Lol ""jewish American"" we need more ""jewish african"" representation or ""Jewish japanese"" representation. Just call them jews, viture signaling by adding their region is stupid. 

And the other point....your glad to see more jews in hollywood movies? LoL every movie that farts out of Hollywood is filled to the brim with jewish actors and production members. If anything they should start putting affirmative action limits on the amount of jews that can be hired by hollywood so other ethnic minorities can gain employment.",mnwmd5
gv5n5ny,"One of the big giveaways, as others have pointed out, is the app. Sugaring apps/websites are very common in college circles, especially in NYC. The other main signs that it was a sugaring arrangement were the bracelet that both Danielle and Kim have and the comment about wanting to “help with tuition”. Not all sugar daddies will pay with just cash, many pay babies with gifts and luxury items. One of the central differences between sugaring and other forms of full-service sex work (like prostitution) is that, in a sugaring arrangement, the central drive/goal is a desire for connection and a relationship. A lot of sugar daddies seek to achieve this by helping babies save for significant costs/things to better their lives. A lot of the tip-offs that it was a sugaring relationship probably wouldn’t be super apparent to someone who isn’t familiar with the scene, but as someone who’s been in pretty much the exact same college scene as Danielle, it felt very accurate to the signs of sugaring.",mnwmd5
guoqhit,Yeah the app she uses is called “sugar” so she’s looking for those kinds of arrangements. Also he gives her cash early on,mnwmd5
gv2arxb,That’s because that’s what sugaring is,mnwmd5

gv5nthk,"This feels unnecessary and spiteful. We never see Danielle pre-weight loss. I interpreted it as her having been more on the chubby side before her weight loss (the section with her father talking about her being turned down for the dance reinforces this), and that resulted in her seeming much much thinner by comparison. Also, in Jewish families it’s incredibly common for mothers and older women to dote over younger girls/young women and criticize their weight, particularly by telling them to eat more. Food is a huge part of Jewish culture and one of the most common ways we show love and care is by trying to nourish each other/get everyone to eat more.

Also, Rachel Sennett is a pretty small woman. Just because we’re conditioned to seeing hyper-petite women onscreen doesn’t mean that, by real world standards, she isn’t pretty skinny.",mnwmd5
hkbdcy0,It's heavily implied that she used to be overweight so no need for her looking extremely skinny for everyone at the shiva to bring that up.,mnwmd5

guif7bf,"agree, this was really overrated to me and felt weirdly impersonal. like any online girl with over ten thousand followers on twitter could have had this made about them. the jewish stuff felt almost like satire how clumsily it was going down a hackneyed checklist and the technique of loud noise building to a crescendo then someone screaming or dropping something was used like seventeen times. the only actors who did well were the parents and the ex girlfriend who should have been cast in the main role instead. nothing about jewish culture or sugar babies or growing up was illuminated, no wisdom imparted at all, on the contrary it was annoying to see the main character act exasperated with an Oh The Drama! look as if the entire situation wasn’t their doing",mnwmd5

gv5mgyz,"I agree- I found the shots with Maya and Danielle to be the most memorable out of the film. The shot of them kissing under the window while the older woman is in the kitchen, the two of them walking behind the same old woman near the end of the film, and the sequence in the car while they keep looking away from each other before finally meeting eyes all stuck with me. I think those moments showed that the team was absolutely capable of framing memorable shots and I do wish we could’ve gotten more of that between Danielle and Kim/other characters.",mnwmd5
