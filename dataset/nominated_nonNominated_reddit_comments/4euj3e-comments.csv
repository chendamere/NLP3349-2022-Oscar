d24qob9,"The Jungle Book exceeded any expectations I may have had. I was wary (despite the all star cast) that this would turn out to be underwhelming for a live action rendition but I am happy to see my worries stifled, much like the red flower.  
  
**A few things that stuck out to me:**  
  
King Louie was much more sinister than I recall from the animated Disney version. I was impressed with the attention to detail when the director was building tension (such as Louie's hair being left behind as he arose due to having remained in his throne for such a long time undisturbed).  
.  
My boyfriend and I were both floored with how emotionally we reacted to the Bear Necessities. I was worried Bill Murray was a miscast (I recall some saying John Goodman would have been better and at first I agreed). The rapport was very organic between a naïve child and a cunning (yet oafish) bear.  
.  
Sher Khan's story about the cuckoo (and subsequent scene transition featuring one) was incredibly well done. It was tense, yet innocuous on the surface. The perfect balance to instill doubt without spoon feeding the audience with the metaphor.  
  .    
I could go on, however, just as a side note, I found both the porcupine and the pangolin's personalities to be quite endearing. A great amount of comedic relief without being overbearing.   
  
As another side note, the little dialogue between Baloo and Mowgli discussing ""Propaganda"" (regarding the wolves creed) was adorable. I audibly laughed, just as a young girl asked her mother just moments after that exchange ""what IS propaganda?"". My boyfriend and I couldn't help but wonder what the best way to explain propaganda to a young child would be, not unlike our protagonists.  
  
.  
  
Overall, we both really loved the movie. My boyfriend had no idea what he was getting into, as he didn't see any trailers or hear much about its existence. I saw the trailers and was wary, but I'm glad I knew about it as I went into it with low expectations and left with them exceeded.  
.  
  
**Edit**: I wrongfully thought Louie was in the book. Redacted that commentary. ",4euj3e
d23hdp6,"For a contemporary blockbuster this is a remarkably patient film. In order to instill in its audience the sort of wonder it ultimately summons, it allows itself to linger on small moments most modern blockbusters have no time for, so that by the end of the film, we know the Law of the Jungle as well as Mowgli and his pack, and we care that Shere Kahn has threatened it.

Of course none of that would be possible without the extraordinary work of the bajillion CG artists who worked to make this film as stunning as it is. It's easy to heap praise on the voice actors, who all certainly did amazing jobs, but their performances came to vivid life thanks to those artists.

I know some people didn't like the intrusion of the songs, but this movie is like a myth, and its songs are the most vivid reminders of the timelessness of this story.

This movie simultaneously made me proud to be human, and encouraged me to remember my responsibility to nature. I had a classic Disney experience.

TL;DR: got high, LOVED the movie
",4euj3e
d25txxt,"If you think about it... a big theme of this movie is a people (the wolves) coming to accept a person who is from somewhere else and isn't quite like them (Mowgli) for who he is, and realizing it's better to celebrate him for who he is rather than trying to force him to be like everyone else or leave. I don't know about you, but i'm happy that that's a story being told nowadays, especially considering some of the worlds biggest issues right now.",4euj3e

d23oxel,"Can we take a moment to admit that Shere Khan is really the tragic hero of this movie? Spoilers ahead.

Seriously though, all this guy really wants to do is protect his home from getting burned down. Everyone fully admits that man is destructive and talks about them burning down the fucking forest. But naw, this guy's cool. And you know what this little fucker does? He burns down the fucking forest! And after we have very clearly proved that Khan was right all along, they band together and fucking kill the poor bastard. What do the fucking wolves care, they live up on fucking pride rock, why would they give a fuck if the forest burns down? Shere Khan was sticking up for the working middle-class forest creatures against wolf pack tyranny.

Jungle Book represents everything that is truly wrong about society. Khan shows up, everyone cowers in fear at the sight of him. You know what that does to someone after a long time? Here's a place where everyone is supposed to be equal, but no, not the fucking tiger. Bunch of fucking racists. I mean the guy clearly has PTSD and instead of getting him the help that he needs they villainize him. Did Zootopia teach us nothing? #TigerLivesMatter

You know what, don't worry about it Mowgli, 80% of our home is gone, but since you came in with the fucking mute elephants and put the fire out we're totally fucking chill. Bullshit. All of this could have been prevented if they had just killed that little shit from the get-go.

d23h8ub,"I like this movie and this movie one of my favorite movies so far in 2016. The Voice cast were good and convincing from the Kaa, Baloo, to Shere Khan.

I don't have any problem if Disney took this approach for their upcoming live-action adaptations. It is a success with this movie and Cinderella. This approach may straight forward but they added some dimensions and properly executed those movie.

Also, Neel Sethi as Mowgli was amazing and it is not easy to for a child actor to act in front of green screen for the entire movie.",4euj3e
d23h3co,"So, overall, I really enjoyed it. 

I was absolutely blown away by the animation. It's probably the most realistic stuff I've ever seen in a movie, *maybe* excluding Avatar. 

I'm not joking when I say the animals actually looked real (for the most part). There was some stuff that didn't quite mesh well, mostly during the shots where characters and environments are moving or shifting around quickly, but those moments were few and far between.

The acting was really solid as well. Idris Elba, Ben Kinglsey, and Bill Murray were pretty much perfect in every way. Christopher Walken was...himself, which is pretty great. 

Neel Sethi, I thought, did a really good job. Some of his lines felt a bit forced or over acted, but he nailed the physicality of Mowgli. It's definitely not easy for a kid his age to act on a sound stage with that much green/blue screen happening around him, so props to Favreau for really pushing his performance to the max. 

I think the biggest problem I had was the editing. Some of it just felt really strangely paced and timed, specifically in the climax, which felt *really* drawn out. 

The songs were...weird. I think that's because there's only two, and the first one, 'Bare Necessities', doesn't come in until well past the start of the second act. To me, it seemed out of place with the how the rest of the movie played out. Maybe that's just because I'm used to the old cartoon version. 

But again, overall, I really enjoyed it. Super solid work all around from the cast and from the incredible artists who made the animals and the world almost literally come to life. 

Edit: I only saw it in 2D, so I have no idea if the 3D adds anything significant. If what I heard it true, then it's like a whole other movie and really something special. ",4euj3e
d23gsxd,"I really loved this movie. It still had the child story vibe but Favreau adapted it super well. He knew which parts of the story were vital and which could be kept out. I think one of the biggest things was how he gave Shere Khan more depth than the old animated film did. 

The visual effects are as good as everyone is making them out to be and it really baloo (hah...) me away. Aside from some of the smaller animals (flying squirrels, etc.) everything looked phenomenal and all of the main big animals and the setting looked as real as ever. 

For me, I think the voice acting is what sold me on it all. I think each character was perfectly cast and the voices were exactly how I would expect each animal to talk if I were thinking about it in my head as well as based on what the old animated feature gave us. 

The Jungle Book was always one of, if not, my favorite stories as a kid and I'm just happy that Jon Favreau could take advantage of the tools and technology today and bring this to life like we've never seen before. The movie is a ton of fun, especially if you are a fan of the classic and there are a ton of great moments. Favreau has always been great, but he seriously ups his cred with each new movie he puts out. ",4euj3e
d23jt48,"Disney has really been killing it with their recent films. Such a gorgeous film, really nice story, and great acting all around. Really loved the elephants and King Louie.",4euj3e
d23hfxr,"Wow, this was such a fun film to watch.

First off, yes the CGI was fantastic and totally engrossing. If you want a pretty movie to watch this is one of the prettiest I've seen in a good bit.

I think most of the voice acting was spot on. Lupita Nyong'o has some great, emotionally filled scenes. Other times she seems a bit wooden. Scarlett Johansson was also good, but her scene was kind of unnecessary imo.

Otherwise every other voice actor does their job perfectly. Kingsley as Baheera brings that wise presence to the film, Idris Elba is terrifying as Shere Khan, Bill Murray is just hilarious as Baloo, he has quite a few great jokes. Giancarlo Esposito didn't have much to say, but when he did it felt like a wise father figure.

And Chrisopher Walken as King Louie... maybe the best casting in the whole movie. He perfectly encapsulates everything I remember King Louie being in the original film. He stole the movie for the brief time he was in it.

Now Neel Sethi as Mowgli. Look, he doesn't steal any scenes and he's not great sometimes. In fact he has a couple of parts where you can tell he's just really, really inexperienced as an actor. But, I give this kid credit for the job he had to do acting across virtually nothing for the whole film. He gets a passing grade from me though.

The story is actually surprisingly well done. It doesn't vary much from the animated film, but it's more like a puffed up version. It has these little twists that make it entirely its own while still feeling familiar.

Music is great. Hearing Bill Murray and Christopher Walken sing will never not bring me joy.

Also, I really, really liked the way they handled Mowgli's character. You'll know what I mean when you see it. They give us little sprinkles of info about him early on that end up paying off gradually through the film until finally it becomes a huge part of who he is. I was very impressed with how Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks gave Mowgli some layers as a character that I didn't think the animated film version had.

Overall, this is by far the best of these new Disney ""live action"" films yet. And I say that as someone who enjoyed the Cinderella remake.",4euj3e
d23pazy,"This was and remains my all-time favorite animated Disney movie, and Favreau nailed it. 

So many nostalgic moments for me. The opening incorporating that mysterious, dark score from the animated film. The backdrop of Mowgli and Bagheera walking against the waterfall. The moonlight shining on the river after King Louie's temple collapsed. They found clever ways to weave the songs in, giving it a unique twist despite using the same lyrics. 

I think John Debney did a great job weaving the songs into his score too, though the soundtrack certainly sounded like a mesh of many different movies I've heard recently. The score when the elephants diverted the river flow was a particular emotional highlight for me. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the interpretation. Shere Khan and the expanded role of the wolves was great. The Akela death shocked me, especially. Kaa revealing Mowgli's past added exposition in a clever, interesting way. 

I loved Murray and Kingsley as Baloo and Bagheera, though the bond between Mowgli and Baloo didn't really gel for me, as much as it did in the animated film. Such that Baloo ""breaking"" the news to Mowgli lacked emotional impact. I also found some of the scenes of Mowgli running toward the beginning and the final confrontation between Shere Khan and the animals to be disorienting. 

But when that book closed at the end, I could hardly hold back my tears, as it evoked so many memories of watching this as a child. Well done Jon Favreau, the VFX/CGI crew, the voice actors, and all the other supporting crew.",4euj3e

Thought more time could have been spent on the Mowgli/Baloo relationship prior to him telling Mowgli to leave, but the rapport they had was excellent and Murray was, of course, great. ""I Wanna be Like You"" also felt quite forced and tonally awkward (Louie was all angry and intimidating while this boppy music played up...?). Think it would have worked better in just the credits alone, because Walken's performance itself was awesome.

Everything else was excellent. Disney once again proving that they're the smartest studio in Hollywood.",4euj3e
d23ml00,"Absolutely loved it! Breathtakingly beautiful animation. Usually I get annoyed when they show-horn A-listers to voice act to capitalize on their name, but the cast was phenomonal. I especially loved Ben Kingsley as Bagheera. One of my favorite Disney characters as a kid, and I loved how they showed him fight Shere Khan. When I was younger that was something that I always wanted to see and I never understood why they never interacted. We see Baloo's fatherly devotion and love for Mowgli in that he stands up and fights Shere Khan and I always was bummed how Bagheera didn't do the same. Favorite movie of this year so far

d27utmy,"I thought it was beautiful, and well directed. I thought the acting was pretty brilliant, but...I left so dissatisfied.

They Disneyfied Disney. Seriously. It drove me NUTS that Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle. The whole point of the story is that he HAS to leave because it isn't safe - not just for him, but for the rest of the animals. Man is not compatible with the jungle, nor is the jungle compatible with man. I would have thought there was a good conservationist moral to be made there, in a fun, and inspiring way, but they totally missed it...

Likewise, the idea that Mowgli is lured into the man-village by a pretty young girl could have been interesting, if they symbolically linked her to the elephants. She bends her arms, and draws furrows into the earth to redirect some water into her basin, showing that yes, man has the power of destruction in the red flower, but can also bend the earth to gentle, symbiotic purpose with water. Like the elephants. It just seemed like a missed opportunity.

Likewise, although I LOVED Elba's performance, I am one of the few unhappy with the fact that his accent wasn't standardised RP. I thought by having him sound like a cultured aristocrat, there could have been some interesting comments made about British Imperialism. Shere Khan with the voice of an English gentleman deliberately, and consciously stepping into the territories of other animals and oppressing them sort of how the British, you know, went into India. The wolves as the loyal, but unimaginative military force. Bagheera is the native officer who speaks like an Englishman but is never afforded the same respect. Mowgli as the outsider who loves a place, and can belong to two places, but can't force his own culture on another...

It just seemed like...I don't know, there was more that could have been said, more depth to have been exposed than there was. Not necessarily in the way I laid out, but it did all feel a bit shallow to me.

Also, this version was much less cut-throat than even the cartoon. It just felt gutless. I don't mean that I need blood and mangled corpses, but there were no stakes because no one was in danger of dying. Akela only did because it served to advance the plot, but death can also advance the themes that were in play, and because none happened (outside of Akela) there didn't really seem to be any danger.

Bagheera and Baloo are swiping at monkeys, and lying on them, and the monkeys get up, shake out their fur and run off. They don't even seem stunned. Fire burns through the jungle, but no one is ever seriously in danger. It doesn't even come close. Why should I care about the danger inherent in Mowgli's presence, or Shere Khan's actions, or marvel at the power of the jungle if there is none to be had?

ALSO Kaa - Kaa is totally shoehorned in. Why not, at the end of the story, reveal that Kaa slithered up, and devoured Mowgli's father, thus giving her presence there a purpose, and making her complicit in Mowgli's disenfranchisement?

And then, at other times, the script resorted to cheap cliches for no reason. Like when Baloo tries to drive Mowgli off by saying he means nothing to him? It was a cheap emotional ploy. Mowgli STILL would have been upset enough to go off and sulk had Baloo calmly, and politely told him he had to go, and why. No need to be a dick about it in the most cliche way possible.

Just...I don't know. It was extraordinary in some ways, but it didn't thrill me. It didn't give me the shivers.",4euj3e
d23lyak,"Loved it! though surprised the ending where he goes to the village was specifically left out, and I'm curious as to why... though assume it's for the sequel. edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OlIvMhnJkQ

(http://i.imgur.com/wbISXdY.jpg / http://i.imgur.com/buCZjOa.jpg) 

Have Favreau/Marks spoken to this yet?

I was anticipating it, and was looking forward to how they'd do it, but the movie didn't end with the girl fetching water and flirting with Mowgli, luring him into the village ultimately. Instead it ends just before that scene, when Bagheera, Mowgli and Baloo are celebrating (on a tree together, in this case – which was adorable, yes, obviously).

So are they having Mowgli stay in the jungle for the sequel? Would have been cool to see this scene play out in this new world, but if it's coming in a sequel I suppose maybe that's just as fine. But I like the bittersweet ending where he ultimately leaves the jungle, to stop playing, and grow up and discover new things.

d23mhlj,"Minority opinion here apparently, but the movie didn't do much for me. It wasn't infuriating but there were few if any real stand out moments. King Louie was great, Bill Murray did a good job, as did Elba, but overall it didn't leave that much of an impact.  It takes some elements from the books, that gave it it's gothic mythic nature but not enough so it just feels stuck between the Disney whimsy and it. 

I also thought the happy ending was a little too cheesey for the Jungle Book  and didn't make sense. Uniting the Jungle was never really a thing. Plus Mowgali gives up the fire when he sees how he's causing destruction the way a man does, but then fights Shere Khan with fire so that just seemed pointless.  Neel Sethi's acting left a lot to be desired too. 

I don't think it's terrible, just not very memorable. Nothing made me laugh out loud or really got me in the heart. 

Plus they mispronounced every Hindi word they used so that was really annoying. ",4euj3e
d24m55k,"All right, time to be that asshole... this movie is just okay. And I'm a huge Jon Favreau fan. But a 94% RT movie this is not.

Let's start with the good. Like the other recent Disney remakes, this film makes a decent attempt to differentiate itself from its animated predecessor. Making Mogwli an internally-troubled engineer (so to speak) was an awesome creative choice, particularly when he saves the baby elephant to John Debney's ""Bare Necessities""-inspired score. That was one of the few times the movie successfully wove musical nostalgia in a way that worked (more on this later).

Additionally, with all this talk about the animation, I will say that the filmmakers did a phenomenal job in making us buy the existence of talking animals. A goofy bear voiced by Bill Murray could have felt out of place in a live-action movie. But the filmmakers instead made the animals realistic enough to be impressive but cartoonish enough to avoid the uncanny valley when they talk. You can’t make a talking bear as realistic as say the Revenant bear, but this attempt is as good as it gets. R.I.P. Garry Shandling as well.

Now the bad.

The pacing and editing for this film are incredibly awkward. Baloo is introduced, develops a friendship with Mogwli, and breaks off the friendship in a “misunderstanding” cliché all in less than half an act. King Louie somehow knows of the death of Akela while the communication between different animals with different languages remains unclear. Mogwli somehow sets the entire jungle on fire instantaneously with one torch. These are just a few examples of the film’s oddities, on top of all the various sequences dully drawn out or rapidly chopped together.

Now, here’s the point I get downvoted… the actor playing Mogwli does not do a very good job, despite comments to the contrary. I hate saying that because after The Last Airbender disaster, any time Hollywood casts a child actor of the correct race should be applauded. But here the kid overacts and often times looks confused about what he’s acting toward. Not his fault, though. This is what happens when you take a boy less than 10 with no acting experience and throw him into an all-green-screen movie. I’m sure it was challenging, but with a $175 million budget, couldn’t we have given this kid a couple more shots at some of the key lines? I’d say bring on Andy Serkis as a motion capture coach, but of course he’s making his own Jungle Book movie.

The screenplay also fails to give Mogwli an interesting personality. Look at the animated movie. Mogwli moves around like an animal, scruffs down bananas without manners, whines and moans… not a perfect character, but at least there’s someone cynical for the positive Baloo can bounce off of. It’s interesting to watch. Here Baloo is part con artist bouncing off of a kid who has zero personality. Imagine if Mogwli bit back at Baloo’s comments as well as build the mechanism to bring down the honeycombs? You would have had a dynamic buddy relationship more interesting to listen to and watch than the animated movie. Alas, it falters instead.

Finally, the movie awkwardly tries to combine elements from the original book and the animated film together and suffers from it. “Bare Necessities” sung off key by Bill Murray is unnecessary. King Louie singing “I Wanna Be Like You” makes even less sense – he’s Disney-invented character, but uses the term “red flower” from the book, but then sings the lyrics “red fire” in his Disney-written song. The up-down inconsistency was grating.

Overall, Jon Favreau’s Jungle Book is vastly overrated movie. An admirable attempt to be sure, but not the must-see event it’s making itself out to be. Ball’s in your court, Andy Serkis.",4euj3e

d23sk2t,"Saw the movie last week in regular 2d. And I must say that I wasn't impressed. I'm not sure what I expected from this movie, but definitely not what I saw. First of all, the visuals were great for the most part. Obviously, the most attention was paid to main characters and their animation, so most other creatures looked a bit fake. The best animated and looking ones were Bagheera and Shere Khan, Balu felt bit fakey in my opinion. Wolves looked the worst of the bunch and had little emotion on their faces in comparison to other main animals. The cinematography was pretty nice for the most part, some really creative visuals here and there but aside from few scenes nothing much stands out in my mind. Don't want to spoil anything, but few scenes at the end of the movie were pretty breathtaking.

The kid that played Mowgli is alright. He's not terrible, but he's not very good either. I never bought him as a kid of the jungle, though, but considering that all he had to work with is green screen I think he did alright. He looked the part, that's for sure.

The thing that disappointed and underwhelmed me the most is the story. Yeah, I know some of you will say that it's just a kids' movie, what do you expect and the original wasn't that smart and so on, and all I can answer is that it's not an excuse. This movie felt shallow. Like really, really shallow and it felt underdeveloped. First of all, with new more realistic visuals the viewer expects a bit more realism in workings of the world. I can buy talking animals, I can buy singing animals, but what I can't buy is the kid who lived all his life in a jungle among feral animals who never shows any signs of it, never acts like an animal (aside from like one short moment in the whole movie) and overall just feels like just a human that just got lost in a jungle for one weekend. I know it was like that in the original movie, but that was a silly comedy that never made pretense that it's somehow serious. This movie really wanted to be smarter and more serious, but it missed its chance completely. You can suspense the disbelief only so much until it breaks. And it breaks hard right from the beginning. Kids' acting certainly didn't help, but I must say that he acted like a kid and never felt more advanced that he looked, which is rare among child characters in movies.

The plot was a bit more coherent and developed than the one from the original movie, but had little of that Disney trademark heart in it. The emotional moments rang hollow, because the movie never bothered to make a viewer sympathise or relate to Mowgli. He's a very simple character. He's just a kid who wants to stay in the jungle. That's it. There's little to no conflict or development in him. He almost never acts on his own and things just kinda happen to him and he gets thrown from one place to another, from one setpiece into another. He's boring. So is the movie, at least the first half. The first third, until Mowgli meets Balu contains plenty of cringeworthy moments (yeah, Disney family movies usually have plenty of them, but they usually feel genuine and with a heart in the right place) and was pretty boring. Lots of stuff happens that you, as a viewer, has no reason to care about because you had no chance to get invested in it. The story was very, very simple. A saturday morning cartoon kinda simple. There are no interesting themes being brought up, nothing of the sorts. Not entirely bad thing, but not enough for this movie's runtime, so there's a lot of padding.

Balu saves this movie. He isn't particularly funny, but he's likeable and brings much-needed silliness to the overall proceedings and gives the movie a second breath. He's a good addition to the story and makes it more lighthearted and fun. His song was also really nice and adds a lot to the movie. So does King Louie. He's the best part of the movie. I kid you not. He's menacing, he's interesting, he's awesome. And his song is so much fun, even if it starts from out of almost nowhere. I liked him a lot and his setpiece is very enjoyable to watch. Shere Khan is meh. Sure, his animation is spectacular and he can be pretty frightening, but he's just as shallow as any of them. You have no reason to care for him, out of sympathy or an interest. Looks cool, but he mostly does nothing throughout the movie outside of growling and looking menacing. Still, his scenes are enjoyable enough, especially at the end. Bagheera is a nice mentor figure, but there isn't much more to him.

Cinderella gave the tired old story new, fresh blood by adding much needed complexity into the story and its characters. Not the whole lot, but it was on point and made it much more enjoyable. It had plenty of heart and a lot of Disney's trademark magic. This one tries to do the same, but trips over its own tail constantly. It's like nobody knew what to do with it. Make it gritty or make it silly, make it dark or make it fun. It's a mess. When it works, it works brilliantly, when it doesn't it's just boring. Maybe if I watched the English version I'd like it more, but I'm not sure that good voice actors can save a lame story. Maybe I expected too much from this movie and wanted an epic journey full of perils and challenges, interesting story and characters. I probably should've known better.

It's not a bad movie and it's certainly watchable, but it's not very good either. If you love the original one you'll probably like this one too. It might be the best The Jungle Book out there, though, whatever that counts for. Usually Disney movies leave me feeling really good about myself and the world, this one left me with nothing. Btw, that awesome Bare Necessities music from the trailers isn't used in the movie until the very end for one small sequence. Major letdown. Also, the trailers showed every major setpiece in the movie. The theater was full of kids and they laughed all the time, so they probably liked the movie a whole lot.

TL;DR It was underwhelming.

d25ljrm,"So, who else felt absolutely terrified when Shere Khan was on screen? He had such a commanding presence. He did something in the movie that I was not expecting at all, especially for a PG rated feature. I wonder what the kids felt watching this",4euj3e

The visuals are gorgeous mostly, but there are some points where the live action and CGI just doesn't mix well. It seems to end up feeling fake at points.

The voice cast was good though, and the saving factor. Bill Murray and Idris Elba were probably the best part.",4euj3e

d23s0ym,I found the songs kind of underwhelming... like when King Louie just sits and sings. He should've moved around a little,4euj3e
d24vbv6,"Few 3D movies are worth the price hike. The problem is, at the theater I usually frequent, the biggest and best screen is also the 3D screen, which means I’m stuck paying extra to see movies that don’t need 3D, aren’t filmed with 3D in mind, and don’t use the 3D gimmick properly. Even a big blockbuster like Batman v Superman barely deserved to be in 3D. For the most part, it’s simply a gimmick to bring in more money to studios.

But every now and then, a movie comes along that totally makes the 3D effect worth it.

Jungle Book is it.

If I had to nitpick anything, I’d say it’s a little weird that there are only two songs in the movie and neither are heard until a good hour into the picture, and both happen within a thirty minute span. They kind of come out of nowhere, in other words. But they are very much “Jungle Book” songs. They fit the picture to a “T” and are sure to put a smile on your face. They serve to lighten the mood after some tense scenes (in the case of the first song) and really creep you out, in a good way (in the case of the second song). But that’s a very minor nitpick and barely worth mentioning. Really, this film is nearly perfect.

As for the 3D, it has perhaps the best usage of the format since Avatar, and in this case, it actually has a good film underneath the gimmick. Unlike other movies, that feel the need to fill the screen with particle effects and “pop out” visuals, this movie uses the feature to add depth to the picture. From the very first scene, as the camera moves away from the beautiful, hand-drawn animated “Disney castle” (sort of) to the heart of the jungle, the vast landscape feels wholly alive. It’s stunning at first, and though you get used to it after awhile, as you start getting into the movie, every now and then you are treated to a shot that looks like you’re staring out a window to a world that stretches for miles.  Amazing work for an amazing movie.

10/10 – There’s nothing I’d change. Brilliant film. Must see.",4euj3e

d23wz7c,"So I don't think this will be seen by anyone, but I am extremely surprised at how much /r/movies is loving this film.  I found it really underwhelming, especially compared to the praise it's getting.

The story and arc are extremely weak.  Just like the original, it's basically a series of loosely connected vignettes.

It's dangerous to center your film around a child actor acting opposite of CGI creations.  I understand that it's necessary for The Jungle Book, but the acting did not work for me.

The jungle literally has two women: Raksha and Kaa.  That's it.  Practically every other character that has a speaking role was male.

The two songs were wildly out of place.  Neither Bill Murray nor Christopher Walken are known for their singing prowess.  Nothing visually interesting or fun happens in those moments.  The movie just comes to a screeching halt to give us the two songs we remember from the original.

The animal CGI was admittedly very impressive.  The sheer 3D spectacle and scale were both pretty good (though nowhere near Avatar, as some have claimed).

I don't know what I expected.  This is exactly what I would have pictured from a live-action Disney Jungle Book, and yet all the rave reviews convinced me it was something more.  There's definitely some things to like, but I don't understand the ""one of the best Disney movies ever"" sentiment.  Zootopia came out literally six weeks ago, to say nothing of the past 80 years of classics.",4euj3e
d23hec9,"I watched the original Jungle Book over and over as a kid and this movie made me feel so damn nostalgic I almost shed a tear when they sang Bear(Bare?) Necessities. I'm really glad that they kept the songs from the originals but I still prefer the originals tho because King Louie wasn't as wacky(he's also goddamn huuuuuge). 

The overall voice cast was excellent but I personally didn't think ScarJo was the best choice for Kaa.

Immensely popular with all the kids. Disney took in the songs from the series for the localized versions and even brought in some of the voice actors from the series for the localized versions.

I thought the actor who played Mowgli was really bad, and I can sympathize as to why, he's just a kid and is basically acting in this movie alone, these animals aren't actually there. But still, it was just really taking me out the movie how bad it was.

I was honestly expecting to come here and see at least a divide, but this is overwhelmingly positive stuff and I just don't get it.

Its a really strange feeling to be honest. ",4euj3e
d23ju4t,"Thoroughly loved the movie. Glad that they had the songs incorporated although both were kinda repeating the same verses. Was smiling when ScarJo actually sang ""Trust in me"" in the credits and then realised it would actually have worked if Kaa sang during her scenes.    
    
Kinda clever that the story's end wasn't the same as the cartoon. Really glad that they are going for the sequel, but they better be quick. Neel Seethi is bound to go through a growth spurt so we might see Mowgli's teen angst instead.    
    
Just like Disney did before, kinda wished that they re-use some of the CGI from this one, and made a live Robin Hood too, heh. ",4euj3e

d23ig4o,"Truly incredible visuals. I was in awe at so many points in the film. The jungle itself felt like a character in its own, just as alive and vibrant as the speaking animals in the film. And the voice acting is simply superb. Elba, Murray, Kingsley, and Johansson, in her one single scene, are truly captivating. Not to mention Neel Sethi, who had the unenviable task of acting believably among non-existent characters on set.

I loved this film so much. The awe of nature, the music, the incredible action. Everything just worked so incredibly well together. After this and last year's Cinderella, I'm all for Disney remaking their classic animated films if they remain this good. Do yourself a favour and spend the extra few bucks to watch it in the biggest screen you can. Watching this in 3D IMAX was simply stunning.",4euj3e
d2c0089,"Ok, the people in this thread are taking crazy pills.  The movie sucked, and here's why:

-Mowgli's acting was fucking garbage.

-The animal cgi was good, but the facial/mouth cgi was awful.  And for those of you saying that facial capture is a waste of time, you are just wrong.

-King Louie was waaay too big, like, why the fuck is King Kong in this movie?  His hand is literally the size of Mowgli.  Orangutans do not get that big - what a joke.

-The songs were not well conceived.  I kinda get how Baloo's song comes into play when they're chilling, floating down the river, but King Louie's song during a moment of intense drama was totally out of place.  If they were going to include 2 songs from the original, why not include more, why make inconsistent use of them, why force Christopher Walken to sing at all when his voice is complete shit?  If they wanted songs at all, it should have only been Baloo's song, but really, I don't think they should have had any songs.  Just stick to turning the songs into dialogue like the scene with Kaa, which was actually well done.

-They totally blew the ending of the movie by keeping Mowgli in the jungle rather than him being enticed back into human civilization.  It sets up an obvious cash grab for sequels and totally undermines one of the strongest statements of the original movie that there are natural forces that drive like species to each other out of necessity (sexuality, social solidarity, instinct, etc.).

I have even more issues with the movie, but these are the major ones.  Hopefully people sorting by controversial will see my opinion because I know there are some like-minded people out there.  If you want to see a good Disney movie, go out and see Zootopia, or rent the new Cinderella, which were both excellent movies.  Cheers.",4euj3e

d24kyy6,"I can not complain as I'm 34 so for me this movie was about having a good time.. I had a good time but if I am going to be critical of the movie the one thing that sort of bothered me was that I found the facial expressions to be a little too subtle on the animals like in the cartoons you can really exaggerate the facial expressions to give a sense of emotion but I don't know. The animals looked absolutely brilliant in terms of realism but with them being too expressive I don't think it would have worked, probably have to be a little more pixary which I'd have enjoyed seeing...Either way it was a good effort and there was a lot of animation involved. And the kid acting as Mogali well bit hit and miss for me the acting felt forced whether that was intentional i don't know it was noticeable to me and put me out of the scene a tad...I'll give it a solid 7.",4euj3e

1. While I loved Christopher Walken's song, I felt it needed more energy than just sitting still and swiping at the ground. I think they could have gone for crazy energetic psycho gangster like Walken in King of New York rather than Kurtz/Godfather

2. And I think this might be the controversial one: Idris Elba was the wrong choice for Shere Khan. His accent was a little too Hackney and simply not regal enough. I get that the accent doesn't have to be a mimic of George Sanders, but the gravitas he brought to the role might be better matched by Cumberbatch in the understandably delayed, confusingly retitled Andy Serkis go-around.

I grew up watching The Jungle Book and seeing all the characters after so many years brought back a whole lot of memories. It was so surreal. The voice acting for Bagheera and Shere Khan was spot on. Idris Elba absolutely killed it! He made Khan sound so menacing and scary. I shuddered several times during Khan's altercation and interaction with the wolves. Ben Kingsley was absolutely fantastic as Bagheera. Bagheera (from what I remember) is the overprotective parent who is always concerned about Mowgli and more importantly doing things the right way. His actions throughout the movie in addition to Ben's voice acting were perfect imo. Also, I loved Bill Murray and Christopher Walken as Baloo and King Louie respectively.

My only gripe with it is that I wished that it was longer! The 1h 45min runtime seemed to go by so fast, with all the cuts and whatnot. There was one shot for example, where Mowgli notices a torch above him and the next shot is him running away with said torch.

4) Shere Kan was right about everything, which made him better as a villain. Moglie really was a threat and proved it by damn near burning the forest down at the end. Furthermore, the implied reason Kan killed Moglies father was because the father did the same damn thing!

5) The fantasy oversized creatures - snake and orang - were a mistep. Should have stuck with the regular proportions the other creatures had. It was out of place since everything else was accurate. Furthermore, kids watch this movie and now think those animals are real since all the rest were real sized. We have enough eco-illiteracy in the World.
 
6) Baloo would have NEVER faught that giant snake. Way out of character. Should have just roared at it or something and then make a joke about being glad he didn't actually have to fight.   ",4euj3e
d23jhvt,"1. All casting was perfect, in particular Idris Elba and Ben Kingsley.2. I was a little let down by Scar Jo's part, to be honest. All the other voice acting was phenomenal, and hers just seemed to pale in comparison. Still, gorgeous voice and gorgeous scene.3. The scale of this movie was perfect throughout. Stayed grandiose and huge when it needed to, and pulled it in for the intimate moments.4. The soundtrack was gorgeous. I especially loved the music in the last scene, right before the credits. 5. Kinda annoyed Mowgli managed to burn down half the Jungle and no one gave a fuck.6. The scene where Mowgli rescues the baby elephant was great to me! It would have been so simple to show us what was in the pit and what he was doing, setting it up so we instead found out with Baloo and Bagheera really heightened that scene for me.7. I liked the songs, I felt they worked very well in the scheme of things and were handled with care. The first one felt out of place at first, but I ended up enjoying it.8. I was sad there were no beatlesque vultures like in the animated movie, but all of my other favorites looked great! The CGI was really well done.9 Another stand out scene to me was when Mowgli meets Kaa. The cinematography in that scene was brilliant. There were so many shots an transitions, but it was all so smooth.Overall, I really enjoyed it!",4euj3e
d24sjr5,Be wary - Disney shills abound,4euj3e
d23kzks,"The Jungle Book is a great live action adaptation of one of their previous films. This version is their best of the recent live action films and I would say better than the cartoon version for sure.

The animation was astounding. Every animal looked realistic and I wasn't awkwardly jarred by their mouth's moving and their talking. The voice work was better than the trailers and the voices felt natural and wonderful.

Speaking of voice work, I wasn't a big fan of everyone. Elba was the best as Khan and a delight to hear every time on screen. Nyong'o and Kingsley were also pretty strong, although it took me awhile to accept Kingsley.

But I did not like Walken or Murray's voice work. They never really fit for me. I could only hear the actors, talking like they normally do, and it just didn't seem like they put effort into it. I guess that is why they were picked, to sound like them, but I would have rather had some fine voice work from an unknown than hearing just normal Murray and Walken voices.

I was both glad to see the songs in the movie, but also found their placement to be odd at the same time. King Louie's song especially felt out of place, Baloo's was a bit better, but neither seemed to really mesh with the rest of the movie.

Overall a solid picture for sure, just some nitpicking about voice choices and consistency in the film. You can read my [full review here](http://gorgview.com/the-jungle-book)! :)",4euj3e
d23i5s6,I just saw it in one of AMC's screens with the crazy surround and it was awesome.  The CGI was great but not amazing and the singing seemed a little out of place but not too bad.  ,4euj3e
d23myc6,I think the movie was solid but not great. After watching the trailers I was really worried about the voice acting since it initially didn't seem to match the animals but I was glad to find that it wasn't something that bothered me during the movie. There was other flaws though - one of them being Mowglis acting being way off at times and the movie not really exploring Mowglis relationship with the wolves enough. The Jungle Book is a worthwile watch and an amazing display of what modern CGI can do in the hands of talented artists.,4euj3e
d23ofgt,I liked it but was very disappointed with the ending. I was expecting the ending to be similar to the animated movie which was truly my favorite part as a kid. I loved the rest of the movie but the ending kinda killed it for me a bit. ,4euj3e
d24d0cv,"Well, I definitely appreciate how they reworked the story to be a little less...a product of it's time.

I saw it in regular 3D, and I have a feeling IMAX 3D would have worked a little better for me.

I was surprised at the amount of violence - they couldn't get away without it, but some of that was absolutely shocking.

I do wonder why the Law of the Jungle - said jungle created by elephants - refer to wolves instead of them but okay, that's a nitpick.

The added lines to ""I Wanna Be Like You"" were good, but the lines pulled directly from the original...yikes.",4euj3e

d2abkqp,"This was so underwhelming. Went in not expecting anything, left with nothing. The visuals are so bombarding and obvious they may as well just animated the whole damn thing, Mowgli included. 

Voice acting was bland too. Elba wasn't bad, Murray was playing Murray, Kingsley was alright. Everyone else was not good, especially Kaa. I knew Johansson would suck as Kaa, so wasn't surprised. And her rendition of Trust in Me was almost cringeworthy. She sounded so bored and disinterested singing it. Jon Favreau sucks at directing voices.

I can see im definitely in a minority here, but this was just a piss poor movie and definitely not worth the ticket money.

EDIT: I hate how people are just conditioned to downvote an unpopular opinion just so they can avoid a debate or an opposing view. I hate how sheltered and insecure people feel. ",4euj3e
d23kj0o,"I need to watch it again, but during the final scenes where Shere Khan is chasing Mowgli he keeps taunting him about his father and then reiterates himself saying ""Akela"". Every time he said ""father"" I thought he was talking about the man in the cave and the way Elba delivered the ""Just like Akela"" made me think he was referring to Akela every time he said father.

Was I misreading that or was it Khan seeing Mowgli as a denizen of the jungle?",4euj3e

The story followed rather closely to the original Disney classic. I liked most of the changes that were made. This is one of the only Disney movies where I actually wanted more songs... Or less. I feel that they should have thrown in a few more if they were making it a musical. Otherwise, the short tribute while floating down the river would have been more than enough. The one full song that they decided on felt a bit awkward. I wish I'd have seen it in 2d or imax 3d , because it wound up being super blurry in ""realD"" or whatever it was, which is a damned shame for such an obviously visually stunning movie. All around a fantastic feature. Disney is on a hot streak.",4euj3e

d240osj,"Really enjoyed the movie, beautiful cgi as everyone has said already. Wasn't a huge fan of the songs, though. Especially King Louie's, it just seemed a bit off to me. 

Also, just how far did Mowgli travel that he managed to get all the way back to peace rock with a torch? They must have made really bad time. Also I know it wouldn't really have been appropriate for the age rating but it would have been cool to see the predatory protagonists actually hunting prey, it would have added a little more shade of grey to the movie.

That being said, there is still enough that wasn't put in that the other Jungle Book movie will still have plenty to work with that wasn't already covered in this version. This movie probably has the best CG effects I've seen. I went to see it in 3d but the theatre I was at messed up and played the first few minutes in 2d. So i really got to see what a difference 3d made. I don't mean to sound like a commercial but if you can see it in 3d do it that way. The effects are just that much more impressive in 3d.",4euj3e

d24jz56,Time out time out time out... WHO as the giant squirrel?!,4euj3e
d24kmmw,"Holy crap! That was amazing. The CGI is so realistic. Usually animated animals don't look real because of their overly fluid movements, but here the animals had weight.

King Louie as a Gigantopithecus was pretty scary, especially when he ran outside and roared and swung around. I felt kinda sad for King Louie cause after all he is the last of his species so I can understand why he wants to have the fire like humans. I almost freaked out near the end when I thought Shere Khan killed Baloo. Also, Ben Kingsley and Idris Elba are perfect for their characters. 

There are some things I have to complain a bit about though. It was kinda weird how Mowgli just sets the entire forest on fire. Like he just proved what Shere Khan was saying the entire time about humans, but they just villain-ize Shere Khan; just felt they could have done more with Shere Khan there. Also, when King Louie started singing, it was kinda awkward cause he was angry but the song and music was all cheery and upbeat. Felt they forced the song in there a bit. Also, overall story didn't really have much of an arc, Mowgli is just kinda thrown around and only seems to make any decisions in the last quarter of the movie.

Nevertheless this movie is great. It's gorgeous, fun, and actually improves upon the original. I felt it could have had more meaning, and I felt they were trying to show a message of being yourself with the use of Mowgli's ""tricks"" saving the day, but it kinda got lost. Had a really exciting time watching this though.

It was gr8; I r8 6.4 out of 8 m8.",4euj3e

d24wh64,"LOOOOOOOOOOVED this movie. I walked into my house fully expecting my cat to start talking to me (hopefully in Ben Kingsley's accent). The CGI was spectacular, all the voices were absolutely perfect (especially Walken and Murray), and the subtle changes they made from the original animated version were great (I was pleasantly surprised at the end when Mowgli didn't go back to the man village, but stayed in the jungle. 

My only real complaint was tying Shere Khan's injury in with SK killing Mowgli's father, and all the animals knowing it was Mowgli that had been the child of SKs victim. Just leave the injury unshown and have it be the reason Shere Khan hates Man. Especially when the flashback we see shows Shere Khan just attacking them for no reason. He would have been more sympathetic if the cause of the injury wasn't out on the screen.

The King Louie sequence was so exciting, it felt like an actual disney land ride. SHer Kahn was actually a fuckin scary and sympathetic villain. My favorite was gary shandling as the porcupine. I got a little sad when i realized it was him, but it made me happy too. beautiful and fun movie. cant really ask for much more. gives me a little more hope too when you hear that disney is remaking alot of their older titles.

What I love about this movie was it updated the story so much, but not in a way that the other animated-to- live action movies Disney has done like Maleficent or Cinderella.  But rather, it was content with the first movie and embellished on its plot and themes that it didn't really do much to fix them. Just a bit of polishing up and reworking.  

The CGI was stunning.  I'm dead set that some type of facial mapping was used for King Louis.  The fur, movement, expressions for each character was spot on.  A new standard has surely been set.  

The singing was, well, kinda eh.  Not due to vocal performance (although I lost my shit when Christopher fucking Walken started singing), but I feel like they were forced.  A few live action movies in with no singing and people probably complained. But hey, at least there was only two songs and they were pretty short.

d26idej,"Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie. But I think I made two mistakes that hindered me from loving it as much as everyone else does

1. I watched the original a day before I saw this one. I expected this movie to have the same tone as the first one. I mean Jon Favreau was directing it. The darker, more realistic tone kind of shocked me. 

2. I went in with HIGH expectations. The good reviews, the director, the star cast and Disney's track record got me a bit too amped for this. 

There were so many great moments but somehow I left the theatre a bit underwhelmed. 
Definitely going to watch this again with the right mindset.

d26zvjh,"So, did this film make anyone else want to see the real ""Jungle Book""?  I loved the movie, but couldn't help but think how awesome it would be to have a real adaptation of the short stories and not a Disney version. To see Shere Kahn trampled to death by the water buffalo (that canyon scene was a definite nod), Mowgli skin him and dance on his hide at the wolve's rock. Then get turned away at the villiage, and exact revenge upon it with the elephants (I think the pit scene was another definite nod to the books). Could be truly terrifying. ",4euj3e
d273cpv,"I loved how this movie was a perfect balance between the Disney cartoon and the original book. It does service to both in such a good, albeit sometimes subtle way. 




One of my favorite scenes in the entire movie was when Bagheera finds Mowgli in Baloo's cave and scolds him for his ""tricks"". Right before the scene changes, you see Bagheera standing in front of Mowgli's tools he's built, and it looks more or less like a cage, which is a reference to Bagheera being imprisoned in Oodeypore in the book. Stuff like this was all over the movie, and I loved it. ",4euj3e

I know many directors struggle to get good performances out of child actors and also struggle to get good performances out of all actors when they are dealing with a ton of CGI and lack of real actors in front of them.

d27f9rq,"This movie was really great and I especially admired its great pacing apart from some glaring parts. The snake scene was just sort of thrown in there randomly to get Mowgli to Baloo and find out his past and it felt odd. Also, I was never really clear on what was King Louie's deal. Last time I saw the original animated one was when I'm very young so I'm not very familiar with it (I need to see it again now) but I always got the impression that King Louie was a fun and zany character but now he's like a mob boss. That's cool but then he starts singing and I get all confused. One final thing that nobody is mentioning, at the end, Mowgli just fucking runs through the ENTIRE jungle in like 10 mins  sort of undermining the whole adventure. None of these ruin the movie obviously as I would give it a good 4 to 4.5 out of 5.",4euj3e

d27m3eg,"I was going into this movie with low expectations, as I'm not really a fan of live action adaptations to cartoon movies, but I really loved this one. 

Everyone has already talked on and on about the positives, and I agree with them, so I won't repeat them. Rather, I'll talk about some parts that I didn't like all that much.

In King Louie's song, he explicitly says ""fire"" and ""flame."" I get that it made parts rhyme and was catchy and all, but I thought the whole reason the animals names it the red flower is because they didn't have a word for fire, and thus couldn't call it that. King Louie's song kinda goes against that. Nitpicky I know, but it just stood out to me. And also I haven't seen the animated version in forever so I don't remember if that version of the song had that line as well.

And lastly, the entire jungle forgives Mowgli minutes after he almost burns the whole jungle down. I would have liked it if the animals, aside from Baloo and Bagheera, didn't trust him for longer. Maybe not trust him until after he killed Shere Khan or it was shown the elephants trust him. It felt cheap for them to completely forgive him so soon.

And Neel Sethi had some not so great parts, but he did surprisingly well for a child actor, so I give him props.

Overall, an 8/10. I certainly recommend it to any fans of the animated, or even people who aren't fans.",4euj3e
d27nsm1,I actually didn't think this movie was that great. Whenever Baloo or King Louie spoke it was very apparent to me that it was Bill Murray and christopher walken just doing a voice over rather than thinking of them as the actual characters. I also thought the songs in the movie were ruined compared to the animated movie. I also thought it was so stupid that for a majority of the movie Mowgli is trying to get from one part of the jungle to the village but at the very end he can just sprint from Baloo's Den to the village and then back to the river where his wolf pack is all in matter of minutes.

Kaa appears and was totally unnecessary, So She's going to eat the boy, why does she tell his origin out of nowhere again? Really? And how did she even know? Why did baloo go the cliche be mean to push away  rout instead of saying something along like '' hey buddy You should get moving now we ate totally besties but a tiger might kill you''? Then Mowgil gets the fire and somehow magically sets the whole forrest on fire, but not only that it was out of nowhere it's  he does it in the first place.How many people did he kill doing that?

But it's a great week for Asian representation at the box office with the Jungle Book.
There's no reason they should have cast Scarjo. The Ancient1 would've been an Asian male supporting character from a universe full of white guys. There's really no excuse for this whitewashing and the only reason really is racism. How can an Asian be cast as a lead/supporting character when these roles go to white actresses?

This was amazing. The CGI was incredible, and Bill Murray was by far the best actor. I love how they modernized the songs. Shere Khan, in my book, was much more intimidating than he was in the original. You see him kill Mowgli's surrogate father, as well as his real one. And the way he lunges at the screen scared the shit out of me.

My only criticism is that Kaa was barely in the film. Her VA was great, but it felt like she didn't have much of a point besides talking about fire.

The voice acting was perfect. And the kid who played Mowgli seems like he was born for this role. Did a fantastic job. Hope he gets a lot of work after this. 

The story was great, the CGI was gorgeous, but for me the winner is the score. I'm a fanatic for all that classic Disney music. I LOVE that orchestra version of Bear Necessities (anyone know where I can find it?). Mowgli and Baloo floating along in the water singing it together made me tear up a little.

CGI was breathtaking. Fairly understated, but very accurate.

There was a lot more to take in than there was in the original, hand-drawn animated film from Disney that came before it. I'm very happy that 'Bear Necessities' was redone.

The cast were all pretty great, but I wasn't too big a fan of Neel Sethi's portrayal. Okay, he was the only human who was on screen, and he was in front of a green screen the entire time, but there were a few hokey moments of acting here and there.

Overall, it's a good family film. I'd definately watch it a few more times.

d2gbn4v,"Hi
I'd like to  tell my two favorite parts: I thought Shere Kahn was quite frightening, every time he showed up. I mean I knew it wasn't a real tiger, it was a picture of a tiger, but I was thinking of three teenagers here in San Francisco who were throwing sticks and one had a sling shot at the Zoo, and the Tiger leaped out and killed two of them. So that almost personal experience of running for your life leaving a trail of blood was pulling me into the story like crazy.
Another emotional part that got to me was after building up the stash of honey combes, Baloo realizes he must End his attachment with Mowgli... He says I Don't Want You Around...  Boy that got to me too. I think everybody identified with Mowgli, and his loneliness, and these substitutes who adopted him. Of course he latched onto Bill Murray and his Rejection and betrayal had to be very painful and confusing! I was feeling it too!
My other idea after seeing it, I read how Disney has policy now not to use exotic animals for anything. And you know the artists need to study the animals movements to make it look right, but most viewers haven't been on Safari, but we have watched old Tarzan and watched National Geographic and there's loads on YouTube. And the Creative director said they got their animal models off the internet. It's just a weird hypocrisy to me to take Samples from old movies or footage, trace over it, re bundle it, and litigate anyone who shares or watches outside the theatre. But that is the way the world is, huh? Everybody does it: sounds like a teens excuse, but it's true, everybody seems to be doing if, just seem weird to say No Animals were used in the film. We traced over others peoples animal abuse footage, so its OK.
Well I'm going to close my essay (sorry) with a reference to Tarzan, (I believe the Tiger is India and Tarzan is Africa) and the significance of the Jungle as Symbol and The Rope as Symbol... The Tarzans rope is clearly about England's and Man's dominance over animals and native cannibal tribes. 
Kipling came first: but Disney has appropriated Teamwork into the Law of the Jungle and given Animals conversation... Something Burroughs avoids... Man is master... With his Knife and Rope and Skills... Animals are food. 
Thanks for reading.",4euj3e
d2gdi73,"I'm not a zoologist, or psychiatrist...but I'm fascinated by how we each Project our own emotions differently on these characters. Shere Khan is the villan, not man, not in this story, sure the Moral question of Revenge... Do Tigers want revenge? Can they forgive? Is isn't Shere Kahn just being a tiger? 
The original stories were written in year 1895 or something. Are there metaphors about the politics of the day?
Quick story: Here in San Francisco, in 2007, three teen agers were taunting Tatiana, one had a sling shot, she's a Siberian Tiger, but still, and she made a tremendous leap out of her enclosure.... Any way she killed two and followed a trail of blood to find the third who ran away. You can read about it.
My point is it seems like she was Angry at those boys, right? Well that's a human reaction not a tiger reaction, right? But i bet you can make animals Angry if you mess with them. Try pulling her tail!
Maybe she was just bored, maybe she had been abused as a cub, the Zoo said she was well fed so she wasn't hungry... That sounds so stupid! She opened the jugular on the first then hunted down the others.
Everybody has fun speculating on the motivations of a Tiger character... We're giving her attributes and Morals from our own culture.
Well in the book, Mowgli gets adopted by a white family, becomes socialized, and works as a Park Ranger.
Oh I loved the movie... Shere Kahn was frightening and I was wrecked when Baloo sent Mowgli away.

",4euj3e
d2gigpt,"Then CGI is stunning, it feels like a real leap forward in digital effects.  I like the kid as well, I thought he did a good job - especially since he was probably just working with green screens.  No mean feat for a kid.

The action sequences are great and exciting, but I just don't understand why this story really needed action sequences in the first place.  Bigger ≠ better.  The filmmakers took the same approach to every detail from the cartoon, merely blowing things up and making them look giant and scary...but it doesn't matter if you don't feel anything or make an emotional connection.  (Minor note: I also don't get why so many animals were ginormous...I know it's a story about talking animals but what's the point of making it ""gritty"" and photoreal if several animals, for nor reason at all, are 10x bigger than everybody else?)

The cartoon is about a young kid raised by wolves, and his family realizing they need to return him to humans or else he'll be killed in the jungle.  Mowgli's weak, scrawny, just a little kid.  All the encounters with other animals prove how helpless he is, but Mowgli doesn't want to go live with humans, **which is what the whole film ends up being about**...Begheera can't convince him, and neither can Baloo, until Mowgli sees the first girl he's ever seen and is quite lovestruck.  He realizes his place, and follows her into the village.

This 2016 movie...is about a super kid raised by wolves who is nearly as badass as the wolves and also a clever little jungle inventor, making crazy Swiss Robinson inventions to help his animal friends.  He's being hunted by Sher Khan because his father burned Sher Khan, and he's being taken to the man village (which he's basically okay with until he meets Baloo) except meanwhile Sher Khan has also invaded his wolf family and killed his wolf dad.  When Mowgli finds out, he decides to face Sher Khan in a one on one battle with fire.  Amazingly, Mowgli manages to kill him using a few clever contraptions.  The film ends with Mowgli still living in the jungle and being basically the leader of the pack.

There's no depth, no consequences, no real themes to speak of...except the cliche and normal blockbuster territory of revenge, fulfilling your potential, etc...

So anyways, a story about a funky jungle and learning your place in it is turned into some fantasy about a super kid who lives among the animals, protects them, and is one of them.  Not one moment is even nearly as moving as Baloo's ""death"" in the cartoon...

I know he wasn't aware of what the fire could really do, but wow kid... you burned down a good chunk of the jungle to just toss your hard earned ""fire flower"" out in order to show others that you're not what Shere claimed you to be. But I guess it setup the final sequence and the battle, so there's that. 

Other than that, there were some voices that didn't fit the animals, character development and story progression that kind of bothered me. Overall, a fun movie, as well as an extremely beautiful film for your eyes to gaze upon. 

7/10 ",4euj3e
d23qn4z,"Loved it. The kid could have been better (acting ranged from meh to bad) but the rest of the movie was great. CGI was the best I had seen in a very long time. I wish it had more songs but Bear Necessities was in so that's good enough for me. Pacing was great, and Jon Favreau's faithful adaptation of the original (other than the ape king being King Kong sized) was something I am very grateful for. But man, more songs would have been awesome. ",4euj3e

d2458ip,But arent the voice overs pretty lame? Just seen the trailer. ,4euj3e
d24o1xt,"That was absolutely incredible. One of the best theater experiences in years for me. 

What was amazing was that a good majority of the movie is very stark, terrifying and harrowing. The imagery is not what you would expect out of a kids movie. Animals are incredibly powerful, they have gleam in their eyes and the I growls shakes you to your core. I also didn't expect so much of the movie to utilize rainstorms and pitch black darkness and it created incredible tension beyond just the antagonists in the film.

Also, Neel Sethi is one of the most convincing child actors I have seen in a long, long time. Sure, his voice is tiny and he is obviously inexperienced as an actor, but he gave it his absolute all. I hung on his every word whether happy, sad, angry or frightened.

Also, despite being vocal performances, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Lupita N'yongo and Bill Murray had some of the strongest performances I have ever seen out of them. They didn't hop aboard this movie for an easy paycheck. They put their heart and souls into this performance. Even more so than many of their live action roles.

This was *incredible*. I  actually am cheering for  best movie awards come awards season next year.",4euj3e
d250lcf,"The Jungle Book (1967) is both my personal favourite animated Disney film and favourite film in general. When I heard about a live action remake, I thought ""Oh...ok? You already have the 1994 version, Disney. What's the point?"". When I saw the first trailer, the visuals and whistling of The Bare Necessities had me hooked and excited. 

Today, I finally managed to squeeze a time, this afternoon. I went into it with no expectations but a reminder for me to remember that this is a new take on the legend, and that I cannot compare to the original.

The verdict - Good Lord, It Is Awesome!

Disney just took the 1967 original, polished it up a bit, matured the subject matter and put some meat on the bones, especially in regards to the plot. Everyone nailed their roles, particularly the kid who played Mowgli. His portrayal of the kid is smart, resourceful, stubborn, determined and fast. He's more in tune with the original book character than the film, except for the hair and loincloth. 

The movie is gorgeous to see and the CGI is pretty damn impressive! Any little worries that I had going into the film were quickly dashed, especially in regards to King Louie. 

The film balanced itself with enough hints of the original film while following its own path by covering new and mature territory. Great film!

By the way, I LOVED the credits! Am I the only one who thought ScarJo's take on Trust In Me sounded like a Bond theme? Her take on the song was sensual and mysterious. Holloway was great, but I love the maturity change that they put in on Kaa, here. ScarJo was a great choice! ",4euj3e
d252rxw,Loved it! Thought it was amazing! At some point I had the thought that they should do a Lion King Movie like this. I think it would be pretty epic but maybe that's just me.,4euj3e

d25kmzk,"I'm actually *really* pumped for this movie now. Initially I thought Disney was going to fuck it up big time, but apparently it's actually much better than the 1967 film was.",4euj3e
d26tpqk,"This movie was so much fun. 

The CGI was amazing, no uncanny valley at all. The animal movement was so extraordinary, I could watch the movie without sound just to see it (as someone else said). The landscapes and jungle scenes and water and . . and  . . .  just breathtaking.  

Worth the price of admission:
The cowbell. . . the Apolocypse-Brandoesque Christopher Walken. OMG. The adults lost it.

Bill Murray, the con. OMG. They could have made him a little more fun, even, I think, like have him impersonating another animal in a catch-me-if-you-can cameo type thing. This character was really fun.

Scarlet Johanssen, the seductress snake.

My favorite was Ben Kingsley, the black panther. OMG. The CGI. The pathos. The tragic undertones. How can his acting come through this CGI character? No idea.

OK, would have more but have to be done. 
Well done, Disney. 
The only thing that could have been better is if Disney lightens up on copyright policy.

d23gqyh,[deleted],4euj3e
d23mr72,"Just came back from it,pretty good, simple solid story that held up to the source material with some smart changes from the original Disney cartoon but I felt could've been tighter, not sure how close to the book it was.

Tech wise, it's reach slightly exceeded it's grasp, still not out of the uncanny valley just yet but still really well done, I think I had an issue with scenes with humor that called for a more animated approach.

The kid who played Mowgli was good, although I forgot a couple times who the target audience was, so I wasn't feeling his emoting at times, voice acting was good all around especially Ben Kingsley and Idris Elba and Christopher Walken.

Elba's Khan doesn't hold a candle to likes of George Sanders and Tony Jay but he was still damn scary. Scarlett Johansen was kinda weak, but I felt that they cut a lot of her character's screentime and painted the character in a different light (Yeah they totally rule 63'd Kaa but it was essentially the same character)

Overall I still really liked it, seamless professional editing unlike some Bull v Shit movies and a good score but I wish the narrative had a better sense of pacing and urgency to it.",4euj3e

d261clf,"Having just seen the movie, I thought it was good. My biggest gripe would be the ending. There are so many different mood changes and moving parts after it's revealed that Mogli burned down the jungle (which is also a huge wtf). And I know this sub loves Edris Alba, but Shere Khan was not an amazing villain or character. With the exception of killing Akilla I didn't think he was very fear inducing or intimidating.  Also, his relationship with Mogli was pretty wet. All they had were a few scenes where they noticed each other. And that ""I killed your father"" thing was such BS. The movie explicitly states that Shere Khan didn't notice Mogli and Mogli didn't remember it, but instead they make it seem like a whole destiny thing. Idk I just thought a lot of time was wasted with the wolves and Shere Khan was not that great, as opposed to the Baloo and King Louie stuff which was amazing.",4euj3e

d24z24h,LMFAO at all the comments basically saying the only good thing about the move was the CGI.,4euj3e
d25dwgo,"Must be in the minority here, I thought it was awful. The voice acting seemed really lazy, with Johansson's Kaa the most noticeable. Just felt like a waste of a scene and a waste of a good character on a mediocre actress. I didn't mind Elba as Khan, but goddamn you can just hear the actors real voices come through and it takes away the illusion. Favreau really needs to work on voice directing. 

The visuals were a clear distraction from the poor writing and even they didn't work. It was such a bombardment of CGI that it just reminded me of it's hollowness throughout the film.

Good for kids, maybe good for nostalgic adults, but for fans of the book, as well as nostalgic adults who watched the '67 film as a kid, I think you'll be disappointed.",4euj3e
d268wxu,"Can anyone tell me why Moogli has not died yet? 

I mean just in the movie there are plenty of scenes where he's out in the rain without anything or anything to dry himself with.. Should've died from atleast Hypothermia at this point..

d25pj2b,"Did no one else get annoyed by the ammount of night time scenes in the movie?

I understand that the jungle is super dark, I understand that having dark scenes will help them with the visual effects since it's more forgiving but most of the time the screen was way too dark. I would have been absolutely fine with this, and i kinda still am since i loved the movie, but when you have the last 20 minutes of the movie in night time, it's not very smart to have it so dark.

To add to that, before the climax, there were 2 night time scenes followed by a SUPER BRIGHT blue sunny sky that hurt people's eyes. Maybe this was just a problem with my theater but i thought it was really annoying, especially when you consider how beautiful (and expensive) the night scenes would look under a strong moonlight.

They're just really dumb and inconsiderate, so they end up making trouble for the other animals.

I'd say they did as well with Louie in this one as with the original animated film. He's this crazy, powerful ape who believes the only real separation between him and man (or at least the authority of man) is that he doesn't know how to make fire. So he's try to get his hands on it despite the fact he doesn't have any clue how to use it and would likely burn down the entire jungle with it (kinda like how Mowgli did, but with more ""oooh""'s and ""aaaaah""s).

>The Scape Auditorium is equipped with the only Barco 4K laser projector in the Baltic as well as Nordic countries - DP4K–60L. It offers superior image quality with an exceptional brightness level, increased contrast ratio and vivid colors for a radically improved (3D) movie experience.

> The incredibly powerful new generation Dolby Atmos sound system CP850 delivers sound through the total of 87 loudspeakers, reaching the cinemagoer from five different directions – from the ceiling as well as the walls. All sounds, music and speech move in the auditorium so that you will feel as if you were in the film yourself with all the action happening around you.

> The new auditorium is not only a joy for the eyes but a pleasant experience for all senses. Spacious premium class leather seats, allow you to lose yourself in the cinema auditorium and dive into the cinematic world.

As far as I know, this is better than most IMAX screens since they haven't really introduced this technology in their cinemas, only recently they opened the 1st one of this scale in europe.

d2427gr,"It's an interesting argument for sure. 

Here's how I took it: Mowgli was always told what made men evil was that they manipulated nature (through fire most notoriously) and that's why his ""tricks"" were forbidden by the wolves and Bagheera. Then, when he was with Baloo, his ""tricks"" were appreciated for the first time because he helped Baloo and some of the other animals eat. 

When Bagheera found out, he still looked down on the tricks, because this manipulation of nature just enabled gluttony, but then Mowgli proved himself again by saving the young elephant stuck in the pit. Mowgli was then convinced he could use his ""human powers"" of manipulating his surroundings and use fire to take down Sherkahn. 

Of course, he ended up burning down half the jungle on accident instead and beat Sherkahn just by uniting the rest of the animals against him, but afterwards the elephants dammed the river to redirect water and put out the fires. To me, this showed that the elephants also knew how to manipulate nature the way that humans do, but are wise enough to reserve that ""power"" and only use it when it helps everyone and not just for personal gain. That is why they are the most respected animal in the jungle and humans are the most feared. They have equal power to manipulate their surroundings, but different ideas about their responsibility to take care of nature and other animals.

Not to say the movie implied humans are just naturally evil and selfish. I think it's just kind of that the animals had only heard bad stories of Man and so Mowgli walks the line and has to choose between only using his ""power"" for self gain or for the greater good like the elephants.

That's why it doesn't suffice for Mowgli to be driven out of the jungle and to the village of Man. That's a solution but it's not vengeance - which is Shere Khan's true goal. He evokes the Law of the Jungle for his own grudge match. My, what Hathi would say if he wasn't busy being some weird demi-god of the jungle.",4euj3e
d25uzfu,"It's only lightly touched on in the film, but the Jungle is protected by the elephants. In the book there are several instances of Man being driven out of the jungle by the elephants; in one instance a besmirched group of elephants destroy an entire human village which the jungle then goes on to reclaim. 

Shere Khan is arguably just as bad for the jungle as Man; the other animals fear him equally to man (some fear him more than they fear man) and he is constantly undermining the Law of the Jungle and the other tribes.

d2o9zk1,">They Disneyfied Disney. Seriously. It drove me NUTS that Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle. The whole point of the story is that he HAS to leave because it isn't safe - not just for him, but for the rest of the animals. Man is not compatible with the jungle, nor is the jungle compatible with man. I would have thought there was a good conservationist moral to be made there, in a fun, and inspiring way, but they totally missed it...

They didn't ""totally miss it"", they made the far more important assertion that you don't have to change yourself to fit in. I mean that was Mowgli and Bagheera's entire character arc, that the latter gradually came to appreciate the former's ""tricks"" as something that were part of him and a *good* part of him at that, from getting bears honey to saving elephant calves. 

In the cartoon he doesn't leave because it's not safe, he leaves because something something hot chick flirted with him. Which is honestly just stupid. In the original he doesn't leave the jungle for good until he's seventeen, long after the events of the first book.

>Likewise, although I LOVED Elba's performance, I am one of the few unhappy with the fact that his accent wasn't standardised RP. I thought by having him sound like a cultured aristocrat, there could have been some interesting comments made about British Imperialism.

Why do you feel the need to otherize Shere Khan? The tiger is *the* symbol of India. As in, its national animal. Shere Khan is as much a part of the jungle as any of the other animals. There's nothing foreign about the tiger king. Or do you think India has no history of oppressors or power dynamics beyond the British?

The Jungle Book is not a Western tale. It's a bit sad that you'd only be able to see depth in it if it was connected to Western-influenced history.

>ALSO Kaa - Kaa is totally shoehorned in. Why not, at the end of the story, reveal that Kaa slithered up, and devoured Mowgli's father, thus giving her presence there a purpose, and making her complicit in Mowgli's disenfranchisement?

Do...you know anything about Kaa? He's Mowgli's mentor and friend. I realize this film tried to strike a balance between the book and the cartoon, but frankly I'm glad they didn't butcher her character any more than the 1967 adaptation did. I much prefer her portrayal here, where she's a bank of a century's worth of knowledge like the original, and Mowgli (albeit inadvertently) goes to her for wisdom.

d2k3rm3,"Yeah. I was glad I saw it as a matinee. I was not a fan of the voices (I went in not knowing the actors)...many of them were too high pitched in my opinion.

Baloo: Underdeveloped character, should have been Jeff Bridges. Worst voice casting.

Bagheera: Should have swapped Kingsley's voice with the lead wolf.

Shere Khan: Good voice with Elba, but his writing was kind of hammed up. There was no reason to fear him in the beginning, and then he just seems like an unstable ass the whole time, rather than a calculating villain. I would have liked to have seen him developed a little more..spying, holding court, a few assassinations so we really hate him. I mean, at no point did I really fear Shere Khan. Even when he killed the lead wolf, I thought it was just a snap decision, and it happened so fast to a character who had like 2 scenes (and sounded like he was 25...not the age associated with fatherly wisdom).

Kaa: besides Baloo, my second least favorite voice. The voice did not match the animal. The animal looked very masculine. Either make the animal look more feminine or get Kevin Spacey. Oh, and it would have been nice to have more Kaa.

King Louie: I was pretty excited at first for King Louie because I thought it sounded like Anthony Hopkins, but then he kept switching between a sounding like an old ape, a mob boss, and a jazz singer. Walken should have been a vulture or turtle or something. Great, great decision to make him so big. It made me wish the other main animals had been represented ""larger than life"".

Mowgli did an ok job but was clearly acting with a green screen. Acting was a little forced and the running was not shot to look very fast or real. He looked like a kid from a daycare center. IMO, they should have made him a little older.

There were too many side animal characters for children's entertainment. I felt like I was watching a mediocre kids G movie that had been given a big budget and asked to go PG 13. They either should have made it for adults or for kids.

Overall it could have been worse, but...I had glimpses of what it could have been.

Edit for spelling and info: Some of my wish list:  Could Mowgli please at least set the forest on fire in a plain, or in the dry season? Not sure if anyone has ever been to the the jungle, but a few embers aren't going to make a firestorm. Then the elephants could call the rain down, emphasizing their ""creator"" role. After Shere Khan says ""now you know fear"" could he have said ""and it is...Shere Khan"" or ""..and will see what Man will bring"" or something...that line just hung there.",4euj3e

d254uv0,"I think Louie's song was like that on purpose. If you think about he tone of their conversation he was already going back and forth between menacingly implying things and being ""friendly"" to convince the mowgli.

So blatant in fact that mowgli who is kind of easy to trick and manipulate throughout the movie can see something is up, gets uncomfortable, and feels the need to leave.",4euj3e
d2fklga,"I think Shere Khan's power was reasonable.  A tiger is much much bigger than a wolf or a panther.  One blow from a tiger can kill a wolf.  A bunch of wolves can snip at a tiger, but don't really have an easy way to kill it.  And tigers hunt and eat sloth bears.  ",4euj3e
d2632a3,exactly how i felt,4euj3e
d2spg64,"Agreed. The movie has no tension because Shere Khan wasn't even hunting him but waiting for him to come back. What you get is a series of set pieces that don't feel thematically linked together but rather a retread of the original cartoon.

None of the characters were that funny to me. Walken as Louie was just a resurgence of his previous roles and that really irritated me. The songs felt half-forced and like they could neither commit to full song and dance or not which is a problem considering that the songs are the only bit that people remember from the original cartoon.

Shere Khan was unlikable to the extreme and that stood out to me considering the film lacks depth. Some nuance to the character would of made a better conclusion.

The child actor wasn't great and stood out to me as being unusually clean. Cover the kid in dirt and have the character be more feral because it would at least reinforce that Mowgli doesn't want to go home. 

Overall, the film wasn't realistic enough to justify realistic CGI and felt too much of a retread of the original cartoon. The only scene that I enjoyed was with Kaa (snake) and wildebeest.",4euj3e

d2p2oex,"I think they didn't have move, because of how big he is. So when he finally did get up it was a huge moment and showcased how big he actually is. It also shows how he doesn't get up too often. I feel if he got up and danced he would have knocked everything over.",4euj3e
d24vl33,"I suppose the songs were used more sparsely because the movie pooled more from the darker tone of the original book than the cartoon. In a sense, the sudden move to the songs at least felt fairly natural in how they built to it. Maybe in its sequel, they can have more full song performances in the movie and not just in the credits.

I agree, the 3D was magnificient. Maybe one of the best 3D implementation ever. I like how most of the effect was to pull the viewer into the jungle world. It felt like I  was fully transported into the scenery than watching something on a screen.",4euj3e

I would hardly say the story is weak, nothing revolutionary but certainly not weak. It has been a while since I've read The Jungle Book but I don't know how many female characters are in the original stories. The Bare Necessities was badly done and I think Murray wasn't a good Baloo but I think Walken did well.

It isn't a masterpiece (although the CG work is near perfect) but it is still a brilliant film imo.",4euj3e

d24lck8,"I agree with your points, but I thought the non-expression made it so much more realistic. If you make it look expressive with smiles and stuff it looks too human.

Mowgli is younger than he felt in the book. That being said, I was entertained, and the visuals were impressive.

d2p5und,"For the first part of your argument, I disagree. I don't think it's a far more important assertion, but that's just a personal opinion, so I don't think there's any point in arguing perpetually with you.

As for Shere Khan, I understand that the tiger is the symbol of India, and I know there's more history of oppression than the British - my only point with this is that Kipling is a pretty notorious colonialist, very British, and both definitely factor in to his work. 

And, as far as I know, it IS a Western story, albeit set in India. It'd be great to have an actual adaptation of an Indian story, but The Jungle Book is not that, and has very English roots. Is there depth to it? Yes, but afaik it's also pretty deeply connected to Western history, specifically Britain circa 1890 during its Imperial century, so...yeah, I do feel the need to view it in light of that context?

Finally, re: Kaa, the balance is what I take issue with. The film is NOT giving us his/her status as Mowgli's mentor, and that's fine. But her presence in the film did seem rather forced - whether that's because her role wasn't properly balanced between book and 1967 film, or because the writing was otherwise weak, it doesn't matter. I take NO ISSUE with her knowledge, or the information she provides, but with the reason for her having it and giving it as it functions in a logical diegetic progression of motive, purpose, and thought.

Ie. It bugs me that she knows this, and dispenses it with NO reason. She has no prior relationship with Mowgli that would prompt this exchange of info, NOR does she have any purpose in attending the event of his father's death. 

As such, my previous suggestion (which was not a concept I'm married to, btw, just a suggestion), would have given her an internally logical reason for having witnessed his father's death because she was there to capitalise on it, also.

The original writer for the '67 animated film written by Bil Peet included an allegedly darker version of the Bandar-log (but we'll never know in what way) but when he left the project the part was more or less written for the legendary scat-man Louis Prima which is crazy in a much more lighthearted way.

What I love about 3D is how it can add texture to items. Smoke seems more smokey. Hair seems more hairy. Trees are more barky. Animal fur is more furry. This movie absolutely begs to be seen in 3D because the CGI on the animals and in the background is that good. ",4euj3e

He does have the hypnosis powers, but Mowgli is immune to it because something something man-cub. 

I read a bunch of the picture books when I was little - I'm not sure of their canonicity but they're set after the events of the first book. Mowgli goes to visit Kaa from time to time, he's more of a mentor than a friend-friend really. He's pretty close to Bagheera though. ",4euj3e

There are more elaborate reasons but, as I said, it's been a few years and I do not want to misrepresent them to you.

It adds that edge of Sharekhan not being the only danger in this forest and while other dangers are not revenge-obsessed, they could still kill you.

Bill Murray's jokes were great. The kid acted fine and interacted well with the CGI animals (the bear necessities scene made it really seem like he was with the bear). The CGI was top-notch (didn't suspend my belief though).  
  
I agree with some of the critics in the top post, like Walken's character singing not making sense if we treated this world as real (but come on), the difference in animal languages not making sense or being explained is very true.

Okay first off Hitchcock isn't a film he's a film maker. Also, you don't even list Citizen Kane in there?

But yes, it is more integrated in popular culture than any of those films (or films Hitchcock made). Now, am I claiming that the Star Wars movies are better films? No, I'm not saying that. Am I saying that Star Wars was more influential to cinema than Casblanca or Citizen Kane? No. But the Star Wars films took cinema out of its own genre and built an insane fandom that still exists to this day. Star Wars isn't just a film series, it's a phenomenon.

> And even they they are integrated into our popular culture more than any other films, they really very good films to be honest. 

I'm starting to think English isn't your first language, I'll assume you meant they aren't very good films? Which I think most people would disagree with you considering the original has a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, a 92% on Metacritic, and an 8.7/10 on IMDB. 

I mean shit, Roger Ebert gave it 4*, called the film an ""out-of-body experience"" and said, ""The movie relies on the strength of pure narrative.""

And let's also remember that film isn't even regarded as the best in the franchise, as Empire Strikes Back usually is.

> And Vader? gets wayy to much credit at being a great villian than he should.

In the original, I'll give you that. He plays 2nd banana to Tarkin. But in ESB? He's fucking terrifying and seems like this unstoppable force. He toys with Luke when they fight, imprisons Han Solo in carbonite with no regard as to whether he lives or dies, devises a plan to lure Skywalker, and chokes out the commanding officers on his vessel if they fail him. In Empire Vader is a truly great villain.
