db0fpcs,"The scene where Lee tries to kill himself in the police station is the most gut wrenching thing I've seen all year.

For all the talk of how heavy the movie was, I was pleasantly surprised at how many moments of levity there was. I saw this back to back with Toni Erdmann and I nearly laughed as much in this as I did with Erdmann.",5hi9i5
db0lg06,The scene with Lucas Hedges and the freezer/panic attack really fucked me up. I can't wait to see him in other films in the future. ,5hi9i5
dbb9o0r,"I did not see Casey Affleck on screen. I saw Lee Chandler, a hollow and irascible recluse who is forever tortured by his past. Some of the greatest acting I have ever seen. So subtle and subdued, he didn't have to lose weight or gain weight or play a disabled/gay character to get noticed. Nothing about his performance seems Oscar bait-ish. ",5hi9i5
db0k1dl,"Besides the police station, the scene that choked me up crazy was when Randi was asking Lee if they could have lunch sometime. ""I should burn in hell for the things I said to you."" They didn't need to put in a flashback scene to let the audience know the type of stuff she was saying. I immediately thought of when Tate Donovan's character sees Lee and one of the players says, ""You know that story is bullshit."" Fantastic movie. Think I still like Moonlight more, but I can't wait to see this one again.",5hi9i5
db1ptws,"I saw it today and found it incredible. A few thoughts:

* As a few have mentioned, the scene in the police station was heart-wrenching. Not just the attempted suicide, but Lee's testimony delivered as a confession and him ready to be punished for the death of his children. He wanted to be found as guilty as he felt and felt that it was wrong not to be punished for it.
* The contrast in the lives of Lee and Patrick. Patrick comes off as so youthful and exuberant even in the shadow of his father's death, and Lee is simply a dead man walking. Neither person understands where the other is coming from, yet the familial bond exists (especially where one doesn't between Patrick and Joe's friend George).
* Lee's resistance to Manchester is so strong and so insistent that you wonder why (especially for Patrick's sake) until he is alone with Randi. You see hints early on when he can't process that Randi is pregnant by another man, that life is restored but not through him. When Randi tells Lee ""I love you"", it cuts him so deep, like he didn't want to have heard that, that he didn't want to be forgiven in any sense for what happened.
* Patrick treats Lee like a surrogate father almost right away, asking permission for this and that, and Lee pushes back by declaring that he does not care what Patrick thinks or does. But Lee does care when he tries to assert that no, Patrick can't have one of his two girlfriends over, finding his nephew's two-faced gaming to be too much.
* The scene with Patrick and his mother and her new husband was so painful in the sense that we know almost right away it will not work out. The awkward moments that become even more awkward in being highlighted. The sense that Patrick could do whatever he wants but dwells in an atmosphere of control that the mother apparently needs to avoid sliding back. We further find this out in the new husband's email to Patrick where he asserts that he needs to control what the mother wants to do, apparently knowing what is best for her.
* When Lee says he can't beat it, he means he can't ever get past his trauma and embrace the opportunity to be a parent again (especially when his drinking leads to a fire scare that could have endangered Patrick). He does feel responsibility to his brother but has to find a balance between taking care of his nephew and avoiding his demons.

As others have mentioned, despite the trauma carried through the movie, there are moments of humor -- the hand-cutting exchange being the most highlighted, plus the awkwardness of loading Randi into the ambulance, Lee asking Patrick if he's going to Godspell, etc. The ending didn't feel out of place for me since there is no nice bow to put on the whole story. Lee delivered the best solution he could conceive, and he didn't ask Patrick his preference, taking charge of the situation.

I feel the above still isn't enough to capture the layers of the movie, that words do not suffice to write about the gaps between people and the stumbling that occurs throughout. It competes well with *Moonlight*, and I can't really decide on the better film, both being so different. (I've yet to see *La La Land* to compare with these two.)",5hi9i5
db2dcmu,"Anyone else catch what the second girlfriend's mom said to Lee when she was trying to convince him to stay for dinner? ""If you change your mind in the next 10 minutes, we'll all be here"" - just like how Lee remembered the fire 10 minutes into his walk to the store, but didn't go back, even though his kids were there (""we'll all be here""). Not sure if I'm over analyzing but either way it was a phenomenal film. Great writing with real characters and real situations. ",5hi9i5
db25ea3,That scene where Michelle Williams proclaims that she still loves Lee even even though she has a baby with another guy fucked me up. Both her and Casey deserve a statue. ,5hi9i5
db3toza,"For me, this movie is partially about what depression feels like. Lee is the personification of it. You don't like yourself. You sit around with your emotions bottled up, not really doing much, mumbling and avoiding eye contact, because apathy is better than what you would do if you let your emotions take over. You find yourself doing things that you know will ultimately set you back (represented by Lee purposely starting bar fights) just so you don't have to move forward. For whatever reason, you feel like you just *can't* progress. Almost like you know you shouldn't be able to. Like you don't deserve it. The way that most of the scenes are shot from a distance, with flat framing and angles and no camera movement - that's what it all feels like. Even when an opportunity presents itself for you to leave your shitty job and live in a nice house in a nice town, all expenses already paid, you're still resistant to leave your shitty one-room apartment. Is there any sense in that? No. But depression doesn't make sense. 

And then the ending symbolizes that there are times where it seems like you're so *close* to making something of yourself, to pulling it together, but... nope, nevermind. Turns out you just had a good week. When they paid for the boat, it seemed all good from there. At first I expected to movie to end on Lee going to the store, allowing Patrick to finally get laid. That's a cool fatherly thing to do, it puts a satisfying end to a running subplot for the secondary character, and Lee going back to the store (I think it was the same store he went to the night his house burned down but I could be wrong) could symbolize him finally getting over what happened that night, forgiving himself, and moving on. But then the movie keeps going. He puts Patrick in more capable hands and decides to move back to Boston. To paraphrase Lee, he just... can't. He can't do it. That's what trying to make progress with depression is like. And it fucking hurts. This movie was too real. ",5hi9i5
db0hcjl,"Its weird how this was one of the funniest films I've seen all year.

Great comedic moments.

The film did a great job of feeling so real. Its moments in someone's life, and we are invited to discover it.

There's no big climax, no big happy or dark ending. Its just....normal.",5hi9i5
dbkn1vd,"That last line was perfect. ""Let it go."" Such a simple idea when it's about a ball rolling down a hill, but so hard when it's about real life",5hi9i5
db63rab,"Severely underrated scene was the EMTs struggling to get Randi into the ambulance after the fire and Lee hesitating to help. Lee really didn't know what to do in that situation. Should he help or let the professionals continue to mess up? Lee, in his numb, emotionless state, probably felt like he shouldn't screw things up even more than he already had.

It was the most believable scene in a very realistic movie. Life doesn't slow down or get any easier when you're at your lowest point, it's just as awkward and infuriating as ever. ",5hi9i5
dbrqdd4,"one of the more interesting parts of the film for me was the opposition between Patrick's inability to tolerate the ""frozen"" state of his father while preparing for burial, and Lee's negligence to suggest cremation as an alternative (likely due to the way his own children perished)...",5hi9i5
dbqqprp,"At the final burial when Randy's baby won't stop crying while being held. Lee's look...brings back the beginning scene where he picked up and held his kid, ""See, he didn't cry."" Got me.",5hi9i5
db0szfj,"Anyone else think the musical score was too overwrought when the big twist was revealed?

Otherwise, awesome film.",5hi9i5
dbaiqwx,More like **Melancholy by the Sea**,5hi9i5
db0f2cr,Casey Affleck needs to be in more movies,5hi9i5
dbs922h,"I thought the scene involving Patrick's panic attack was interesting.  First of all it is the only time Patrick shows an emotional reaction to his father's death, which makes sense because his family knew for years that he could die at any moment.  It goes to show that no matter how prepared you are to lose someone, it is still going to affect you in a difficult way.

Also, in the same scene in the kitchen, it is interesting to see how lee is able to help his nephew calm down but he is unable to help him on any real emotional level because he himself is so numb he simply can't empathize.  But he truly wants to, he even goes so far to break open the bedroom door so the kid wasn't in there suffering alone.  Once he is in there he again can't comfort him but he does help the situation by being there.  Shows that lee really is a good guy.  Most interesting is the fact that lee in Boston is basically a guilt-wridden depressed human being who lives in that miserable little apartment where he must beat himself up constantly night after night.  He is walled up emotionally, walled up socially, walled up in real life.  But the second his nephew tries to do the same to himself, Lee breaks that door (barrier) down, and helps him. Just something no one has figured out how to do with lee, including himself.",5hi9i5
db0maw5,"Just saw the film. Absolutely fantastic. It's a very simple story but Lonnergan fills every character with so much depth and pathos. I love how he included those awkward moments during tragedy, like Lee misunderstanding Jacob leaving the car or the stretcher wheels never locking in place. It's a minor thing but it made the film feel so much more realistic. The scene where Lee explains how the fire started should win Casey an Oscar. What a remarkable piece of subtle acting. Really enjoyed Lucas Hass and I loved how there was no real villains, just good people trying to get by in a bad situation. Absolutely excellent film that deserves all the acclaim. ",5hi9i5
dd0oj4r,I really hate it when movies leave things unresolved... is Patrick going to Godspell?,5hi9i5
db0gmmo,"Was it just me or was this also one of the funniest movies? I swear I laughed out loud about 10 times easily, the dialogue between Casey and the kid was just priceless at times. Absolutely hilarious and heart wrenching. ",5hi9i5
dcklm3n,One thing I really liked about the film that I haven't seen anyone mention was the moment right after Lee makes all of his friends leave before the fire. I assumed that this type of behavior is what lead to the Lee and Randi breaking up. Specifically him standing on the balcony yelling. I assumed his drinking and partying drove the two apart. Once he goes back inside you see him and Randi talking and laughing for a brief moment. That quick subversion of where I thought the story was going made the fire that much more impactful because it makes you realize these two people weren't drifting apart. They loved each other and this horrible accident destroyed their relationship.,5hi9i5
db11ft5,"As someone who's been dealing with depression due to loss for a while, the scene where he goes ""I can't beat it"" in a way that he felt like he'd come to terms with it, that pretty much destroyed me.",5hi9i5
db0fiwx,"Saw this a week ago. It's my second favorite film of the year after La La Land so far. Casey Affleck delivers one of the most believable portraits of a man haunted by his past I've ever seen. It's a nuanced, funny, and thoroughly real performance, making for a career-defining display from one of this generation's best actors. If you've seen the film, you'll know what scene I'm talking about when I say I was in awe at how quietly he displayed his grief as the emotions bottle up inside of him. And the moment that grief erupts is one of the few times I've gasped out loud during a film.

One of my favorite aspects of this movie is how, despite the heavy drama and tragedy, it's *very* funny at times. This is due to Ken Lonergan's understanding that life is neither a strict drama or comedy, therefore his screenplay isn't binary in this aspect. Some of my favorite scenes are the banal moments that just develop these characters so realistically through their interactions.

""What happened to your hand?""
""I cut it.""
""Oh, for a second there I didn't know what happened to your hand.""

All of the actors give brilliant, understated performances and I never felt I was watching performers, especially Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. Brilliant writing, brilliant direction, brilliant acting. This movie floored me. 

Edit: Realized this is a discussion thread so spoilers allowed. That scene where he tries to shoot himself. Jesus",5hi9i5
dbqzuba,"Two scenes I found to be particularly affective:
- The scene after the interview is concluded at the police station when Lee realizes that no one else is going to punish him for what he's done, so he grabs the officer's gone and attempts to off himself. Fuck man, that was just so heavy. 
- The scene where Patrick has the panic attack as he frantically attempts to shove the fallen meat back into the freezer. As someone who frequently experiences anxiety, his acting in that particular scene really hit home and actually made me a bit anxious just watching him freak out. Incredible.",5hi9i5
dd07ojf,"The way he says 'please' in the police station, when they're stopping him from trying to kill himself haunts me",5hi9i5
db884ia,"I don't understand how people can see this more than once. I'm just so sad. I just want to hug Lee and hang out with him but he would jut shut himself off from every offer I would give. aaaaaaah, my heart hurts ",5hi9i5
db0k4l4,"My favorite movie of the year. The performances are just incredible. Casey Affleck is a broken man and you really feel it. Michelle Williams, while only in the movie briefly, is still fantastic. But Lucas Hedges was the real revelation for me; such a powerful performance and very convincing as a 16 year old going through tragedy like this.

The film is incredibly tragic. The scene where Lee tries to kill himself at the police station, the scene where he and Randi have their talk, and the scene where he tells Patrick that he's going to stay in Boston were all just so emotional and gut wrenching. 

But at the same time it is also very funny at times.

Gosh, I really loved it.",5hi9i5
dbj7a2f,"I read this in a review and I think it is spot on....Lee Chandler is a ghost who hasn't died yet. Perfect...
",5hi9i5
dcvgoaf,"The scene between Michelle Williams and Affleck alone should win Affleck the Oscar. Much credit to Williams who even in her limited time elevated that scene. When she admitted she loved him and started calling him honey it was heartbreaking. His response of ""there is nothing there"" and trying his best to avoid her naked emotion was an amazing scene. It was so visceral.                                             Affleck's line to his nephew of ""I can't beat it"" resonated so much. Sometimes people don't come back from tragedy. That's as real and relateable as a message as you can get.",5hi9i5
db0xoha,"The scene where Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams meet on the sidewalk is one of the best scenes in film I've ever seen--just seeing how broken these two people are after going through a terrible tragedy, how they can't even function anymore, can't even talk or make eye contact. And just the way all this pent-up grief just gushes out in public, how they're talking over each other, how they're not sure to try and make up or just never see each other again.  Incredible.",5hi9i5
db0fdgf,"This is one hell of a fucking movie. I probably cried 5 times, but none of it felt cheap or manipulative. It was just a sad, real, human situation. Casey's character had a lot of bad luck and wasn't the best dude but pretty much everyone in his life still cared about him in some way. None of the characters here are one-dimensional or antagonistic, even his ex-wife is kind of sweet and caring.

There will be a lot of talk about the scene in the police station, or the house burning, or the main scene near the end with his Williams, but the scene that got me the most was Casey and Hedges at the dinner table where Casey just says ""I just can't beat it"". That one scene is as accurate and honest a portrayal of grief, depression, and loneliness as I've seen put to film.

Also, did everyone else catch Lonergan's little cameo? Took me out of it a bit, was surprised to see him.

db7t13d,"I watched this tonight and have been stewing on it since. I'm going to give it some more time, but I honestly think this is one of the best movies of the decade at this point. Like on par with The Social Network and Inside Llewyn Davis for me. It hits all the notes by creating notes you didn't realize existed before you watched it.",5hi9i5
db0oato,"Only disappointing part of the film was using clips from the same bruins game for two different scenes. Obviously it didn't matter at all, but I thought it was a bit interesting. Fantastic movie though. Loved seeing Kara Hayward and Lucas Hedges from moonrise kingdom too!",5hi9i5
db0ula1,[deleted],5hi9i5
dcyn0r6,"I love the exchange between Randi and Lee towards the end. But another scene hit me real hard. When Patrick entered Lee's room and saw those three picture frames, he stops, and fully realizes just how deep is the wound for his uncle. Another standout scene is right after reading the fiance's email, Patrick is alone in the living room, watching TV. His face shows the vulnerability of a child; the face of someone no one would want. 

Lucas Hedges' acting throughout the film is outstanding. He deserves an Oscar for his performance. 

Lastly, this is a movie that will fuck you up. What a movie. ",5hi9i5
dd0ns2z,"Casey Affleck is one of my favourite actors, so I sat down to watch this movie without too much knowledge of the plot apart from his brother dying and having to look after his nephew.
I'm a firefighter with two young kids, so from the police station scene onwards I was a blubbering mess every 5 minutes. Affleck's performance just killed me, I bought it and felt it throughout the whole movie. The scene where he packs/unpacks [the photo frames](#spoiler) destroyed me.
I re watched the movie with my wife the next day, the early scene with Lee coming home to his family ominously shows [the fireplace](#spoiler). I had to leave the room...

If Gosling beats Casey for the Oscar, we riot.

edit: Just have to add how refreshing the realism of the movie was. A lot of people would say the ending wasn't a happy one but I believe they are wrong. Sure, as far as Hollywood goes there was no warm and fuzzy gratifying ending for Lee Chandler but in the context of the pain and suffering that he will carry for the rest of his life, the small hint of Lee wanting to be apart of Patrick's life is the happiest ending I could expect. I must admit I was scared when they introduced the girlfriend's mother, part of me thought it was going to tread the trope of broken protagonist finding how to love again.",5hi9i5
ddftz0e,"A lot of great analysis on here! Something that I was hoping for when I watched was when Lee met his ex-wife on the street. I was hoping that Casey Affleck would go into a heartwrenching, Oscar-worthy monologue where he reveals all the wounds and regret he's been holding back the whole movie. Same thing at the end when he's telling Patrick why he couldn't stay in Manchester-by-the-sea.

But then when I thought back, I thought that this would be uncharacteristic of the hollow, emotionless Lee. I actually really like the parsimony of ""There's nothing there!"" and ""I can't beat it!"". It says so much with so few words! What do you all think?",5hi9i5
db0gbz5,This movie made me feel like I wanted to cry in every scene. The drama felt so real and emotional. Movie of the year for sure.,5hi9i5
db1q48b,"I think my favorite part of the movie is the sound design. Let me explain. The entire movie is a masterful demonstration on subtlety, in its acting, writing and directing. But what really sold the sheer banality of it all was the sound effects. Non-stop, in every scene, during the tensest of moments. They never let up. ",5hi9i5
db27c8d,"Of all things, I really liked how natural the dialogue felt, specifically in the scene where Lee finds out Joe died an hour before he got to the hospital. It just felt so down to earth and real. I thought it did really great job at setting the tone for the rest of the film",5hi9i5
dbaun9a,"I'm not gonna bother using the spoiler tag for the following comment as I would need to tag the whole thing. Besides, if you're here and haven't seen the film yet you're probably aware that you've put yourself at risk for seeing spoilers. Nevertheless, SPOILERS ahead....:


I wonder if Lonergan ever thought of including flashback scenes of media coverage of the tragic house fire. This type of terrible situation is someone like Nancy Grace's wet dream (my thoughts on how Nancy covered tragic stories on her show is a different story). I feel like in the days/weeks/months following there would be extensive coverage of the events. It can be assumed that Lee was ultimately exonerated of any wrong doing in the death of his three children, correct? If that was truly the case, even if it didn't occur in a social media era, it definitely did occur in an era where stories like these would dominate TV/radio news programs, daytime talk shows, newspapers, etc etc. A young father of three children holds party at his house with his buddies until 2-3am in the morning, where cannabis, cocaine, and lots of alcohol was consumed. When the party is ended by his wife, the father sets the fireplace to warm the house and then decides to go to a nearby corner store. Intoxicated and not wanting to drive, the father decides to walk even though it's an altogether 40 minute trip by foot. 10 minutes into his trek, he can't remember if he put the fireplace screen up but figures it will be okay and decides to continue walking to the store. When he returns, he is greeted by the scene of his young wife resisting fire fighters and screaming that her kids are still in the house, which is now completely ablaze. His wife survives, but his three kids (one of them only a couple years old if that) do not. 

The father admits to authorities that he wasn't sure whether he put the screen up or not before leaving to go to the store. He also openly admits of the substance abuse that went on earlier that night.

It's obvious that Lee was blamed by a lot of people in the community for the fire, including his (eventual ex) wife. But I would wager the story reached beyond just his community. If he was in fact fully exonerated of any responsibility in the death of his three children, I would wager that the story went national for at least awhile. We can all imagine the amount of guilt Lee feels about his kids fate even without the public and media scrutiny. But I can't imagine the amount of stress, anxiety, and overall darkness the man went through if he had to deal with this tragedy in the public eye.

I don't know, this thought just made Lee's story even more powerful and sad. ",5hi9i5
dbgflh4,"Simply an excellent film. As a commenter previously stated, I didn't see Casey Affleck... I saw Lee Chandler. Great point.

[Suddenly seeing Lee's home engulfed in flames was an intensely poignant moment that shook the theater. The guttural wailing from Michelle Williams as she's pulled away from the house was eerily real.] (#spoiler) 

There were a number of completely silent moments in this movie that seemed to last a while, creating a bit of an awkward noiseless lull for everyone in the theater. 

Nice film.",5hi9i5
deaopl8,"What a film, finally got around to watching it after hearing all the hype and it was well deserved. Such an incredible depiction of grief and loss and how unique it is between people. Absolutely love the subtle conclusion as well [with the ball scene where Lee says leave it but Patrick picks it up and eventually gets him to continue tossing it. Such a great metaphor for Patrick helping Lee eventually make something of what he has left. I can see how people would have preferred a tidier ending but I feel like given the absolute shell the character was depicted as an entire turn around would just be too unrealistic. Too me what was best about the movie was its authenticity and a storybook ending would betray that. This ending hints at an uplifting ending without tying things up too nicely and also demonstrates what other movies tend to leave behind, that loss isn't something you ever totally move on from, you just adapt and eventually become better suited to live with it.](#spoiler)",5hi9i5
db0h5y5,"I have seen this movie now seven times. I have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. 

Kenneth Lonergan is the most gifted writer alive next to Annie Baker. A few points:

1. Those who find the movie melodramatic, I respect your opinion, but I also feel you might not be paying attention. The melodramatic sequence in this movie (the fire and S.A.) specifically exists as a flashback. The movie is not about the melodramatic event of someone's life, and we very specifically do not see the central marriage disintegrate. It's about what happens after the opera curtain comes down. Stories have a natural progression of ending in tragedy or using tragedy as their central focal point, but this is about dealing with the pain of the old memory after you've already made a new one. I think the movie as a whole would be almost as powerful as it is now if they removed the flashback sequence (though it does jerk the tears), and I wish that Lonergan didn't include it, not because he doesn't handle it effectively, but because I think it causes a lot of people to misinterpret the film (not saying that I'm somehow more perceptive, but I have a lot of experience with Kenneth Lonergan, having seen and read a ton of his work, and this is a fairly common thread in some of his plays.)

2. The way that Lonergan approaches cliché situations and manages to subvert them, not with any kind of spectacular plotting but with merely his ear for the way people talk, is kind of amazing. He reveals the truth in clichés. A lot of his plays cover this same topic as well (and are of equal quality to this movie)

3. Lucas Hedges is amazing in this movie, and basically gives the masculine counterpoint to Anna Paquin's performance in Margaret. If anyone actually cares, I could go into more detail here.

4. If you like this move, check out Margaret (extended cut), which is from the same writer/director and is possibly my favorite movie of all time.",5hi9i5
db0xmqx,"The biggest praise I can give this film is that it didn't feel like I was watching a movie. It felt like I was a fly on the wall watching these people go through tough situations. It felt so much like real life. Also love how naturally funny the film was. Not too funny, not too dramatic, just perfect. ",5hi9i5

db1p430,Saw this with my dad. I have never seen him cry in my life but during the conversation at the end between Lee and Randi I looked over at him and saw him sobbing. Honestly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! ,5hi9i5

db5b47u,"Manchester By The Sea was easily the best film I've seen all year and I can't really explain way. So much emotion packaged into a incredible film. I honestly think the November might be a stronger Oscar session/good movie month than December. We got Arrival (my number 2), Loving (strong 8/10), The Edge of Seventeen (one of the best coming of age films I've seen in a long time) and a few more I still need to see (Hacksaw Ridge, Nocturnal Animals, Miss Sloane, Lion, Elle) along with some October limiteds that expanded in November (Certain Woman, and Moonlight).

As for Manchester By The Sea it's self, It's a beautiful shot and written film. It almost feels as if the direction is a fly on the wall style. It feels like your peering into these peoples lives and it works. Extremely well.

Casey Affleck gives one of the most subdued performances I've ever seen. I know this is cliche, but this movie feels real. Very real.

One of the best parts is watching Lucas Hedges. We're here watching a teenager, that I for one, completely understood. He was very much a good kid that kept fucking things up. He has a band, and he knows they suck. He has two girlfriends, and two sets of friends to go along with them. He tries, but mostly succeeds at little to nothing in this film.

dcp6s88,"Fucking loved the movie. Art is supposed to make you feel something and that's exactly what this movie did for me. Moved me in so many ways. Had surprisingly hilarious scenes too, especially with some of the interactions between Lee and Patrick. The ending surprised me, but I realized that this isn't supposed to have a happy ending, it's a view into a segment of this guy's life. It tells the tale of Joe's arrangements, and funeral, and ends there. Someone behind me said ""there's two hours of my life I won't get back"" and ""make up your own ending"". Some people just can't appreciate a damn good movie I suppose. Mind you the lady that said it was easily in her late 80's so I understand why she is so upset about ""losing"" two hours of her dwindling life. Would highly recommend this movie.",5hi9i5
dfety2a,"I think this is not so much a film about grief, as it is about men.

My wife gave me this clue as we were leaving the theatre (she pretty much wept quietly all the way through): ""It's terrible to see men trapped in this cage of class and gender. Even the women have to be tough.""

The men, centred of on Lee, are not allowed to show grief. They're not allowed to show love. When Lee shows concern for his nephew Patrick, he does so by kicking the door down. When Lee decides to take on the guardianship of Patrick, he doesn't do it by telling Patrick he cares, but by telling him that he's going to sell the boat that Patrick loves, though he's doing this out of concern for Patrick's security and future. Patrick doesn't want to leave Manchester, so Lee goes looking for a job—but never tells him.  When Lee drinks, and the grief comes up, he expresses the grief through violence: by punching other men. When the grief is freshest and at its worst, he tries to shoot himself: an act of violence. When Lee meets Randi on the sidewalk, and Randi starts freely expressing how she feels, he responds by fleeing. The other men too. When Patrick is reminded of his father by the frozen chickens falling from the freezer, he doesn't cry: he clutches his chest and has a panic attack. When George expresses care for Lee, he does so by buying furniture, or saying ""anything I can do"" to help with funeral arrangements. 

Many people complain about the lack of emotion shown in the film, and the apparent lack of character development. But the film is as much about the cage as it is about grief. Into this group of caged men the writer throws this cluster bomb: the death of the three children by fire. The rest is the reaction of the characters.

But in this cage, both emotion and and development cannot be freely expressed. We have to read it through the tiniest of signs, some of them (like the ones described above) disguised as violence or cruelty.

There are signs of optimism towards the end. On the boat, Lee smiles once—perhaps the only time he smiles post-fire. There's also the ball play on the street. 

The tension in the film comes from the fact that straight raw emotion is almost never shown—except for in Randi's scene on the street, which is powerful precisely because of the background of emotional suppression in the rest of the film. Because it never shown, we have to pay constant close attention to try and figure out what the hell is going on inside the characters, hidden behind these iron shutters, clues only peeking out in tiny gestures, or in distorted forms as explosions of anger.

The film doctor Robert McKee once said that you should never tell your audience the whole story, because they have to left to work out what's not shown. This film does that in spades.

ddc2lp1,"Just saw Manchester By The Sea yesterday and what a beautiful film in every aspect. My only gripe with the film is the casting decision of Matthew Broderick. It was completely unnecessary and all it served was to immediately take you out of the movie for a brief moment. The reaction from most people in the theatre as well as myself was ""ahahah Matthew Broderick"". I was completely immersed in the film and the characters the entire time, and this scene completely took me out of that zone.

They could have casted any non a-list or recognizable actor for this small role and it would have been equally as effective.",5hi9i5

dc2yn41,"I saw this film last night in Boston. I moved to Boston from the west coast 5 years ago, and this film really captures a certain New England thing; where acceptance, not idealism, rule. Lee Chandler is a terribly damaged version of that, but it ring so true of others in the film.  There's the great recurring theme of frozen ground. The boy complains about it and is quite upset. Lee doesn't do much to help the kid understand or work through it. He just repeats 'ground is frozen'. Accept it, don't complain. Don't expect anyone to sugar it up for you. I liked the movie last night and am beginning to love it. It won't leave you for a while. As others note it's not fast-paced, but it is dense with suggestions of emotions, little clues to understanding. It feels like watching a leaf fall very slowly down from a tree in early winter. Makes you feel that way. ",5hi9i5

When he first moved away after the accident, he moves into a small 1-room apartment. Towards the end of the movie, he mentions that he's looking for an apartment with more than one room. I interpreted this as Lee finally starting to heal and let himself move on in life.",5hi9i5
dd22p8n,"Thinking back, there are a few lines that stand out to me as being especially important/heartbreaking. One was when Affleck was speaking to his ex-wife about Hedges's character being okay because ""he doesn't really open up to me, but he has a lot of friends, so I think he's okay."" Which was true, Hedges really leaned on his friends to maintain a sense of normalcy during his bereavement, and they were constant throughout the film. 

Then consider the scene where Affleck steps into the office if his former employer (I think?) to ask for shifts, and the guy's wife comes around the corner and tells him she doesn't want to see Affleck again. Affleck's character had no support from anyone but his brother. The rest of the town really seemed to turn on him. They left him to mourn alone.

It all sort of culminates for me when they're playing ball at the end of the film. Affleck tells him to let it go, and Hedges refuses. Two very different responses to tragedy, with two very different sets of support structures surrounding them. ",5hi9i5

db2bjti,"Here's my pitch for why this is a spiritual sequel to *Good Will Hunting*:

* Both movies center around characters keeping themselves hidden from the world in order to protect themselves from heartbreak (by working as a janitor in Boston, no less). 
* Both main characters project a rough exterior to mask immense pain (unsuccessfully, in the end). 
* Both movies’ central relationship is an older mentor and younger mentee trying to get used to each other. 

* Throw out the Will-is-a-genius-for-some-reason plot line and the audience-friendly love story, and *Manchester By The Sea* is basically *Good Will Hunting* from the point of view of Robin Williams’ character, a man trying to tend to the well-being of his young associate while also being crippled by his inability to move on from his past marriage.

This is all to say nothing of Matt Damon's involvement as a producer, the Massachusetts setting, and Lucas Hedges' [creepily-uncanny resemblance to a young Matt Damon](http://monkeygoosemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MbtS2.jpg).

dedsmis,"Manchester by the sea is for me the kind of fantastic movie that hits you really hard when you watch it, leaves you thinking about it for days, but that you feel you'll never have to, or want to, watch again. 


Manchester is a cold place in the eyes of our protagonist, a grey and white hell with chattering townsfolk. His return there does not grant him, or us the audience , any happy turnaround where the movie shows us that ""even though you've been through something terrible, you can still get back"", as you might expect. The movie hints about it with the single mom and a couple of endearing  scenes between lee and his nephew. Towards the end we get a 2 minute or so long scene with some happy music where it seems thing's are gonna be A - okay, ""i'm beginning to see the light"" ,maybe Lee can make this work with his nephew in manchester? But then he runs into his past, and is reminded that it will never be possible for him to ever live in this town again. Even with the forgiveness of his wife, he could never forgive himself.  

In the end  our hero is too far gone to ever live a happy and fulfilling life.  He is a tragic reminder  that if you go through a terrible enough tragedy the grief never ends it just... exist,as much a part of you as your eyes, your hands and your soul. 

The happy ending we is get is an extra room for the nephew  and a  tiny glimmer of hope that their relationship will give Lee a reason to go on. It's kinda sweet and profound in all it's tragicness.

dc1xzya,This was an amazing movie. Perfect movie if you want a good cry for no reason. Very melancholy.,5hi9i5
de6zkoi,"Commenting here as IMDB message board closed down. The movie was very boring, slow and very uplifting. 

As a resident, Greater Boston, Quincy and North Shore I find to be a very cold place. Personally, on a drive or walk to Gloucester/Cape Ann area (where Manchester by the Sea is) to the art galleries or deep sea fishing, I'd probably never taken a second look at someone like Lee and write him off as just a Masshole Townie; (for anyone outside of Mass who is shocked at my prejudice/elitism, simply refer to the beginning scene between the black female tenant and Lee in Quincy, even when there is empathy/understanding, there is a great chasm in town vs. gown relations and racial & class relations underneath the superficial liberal political leanings of New England). 

The movie didn't change my mind on Masshole townies nor increase my empathy for people like Lee. But it did change how I see love - or rather make allowance that I'd never be able to love someone, friend, relations or a partner in the Hollywood/Kodak framed moment kind of way; but will make do with imperfect gestures that will ultimately fall short, perhaps never be completely appreciated nor understood by my intended recipient and whatever heartfelt/self-serving content said completely forgotten later on; but the feelings felt in that moment between the participants will live on. 

It turns out that the people who have blocked their true selves and communications were Matthew Broderick and Lee's nephew's mother who concerned themselves with living the ""pious"" and ""reformed religious"" life that they had nothing to say except the rigid Hollywood/Kodak image they wished to preserve of themselves by withholding their vulnerabilities. 

I actually thought Michelle William's emotional scene was not as powerful as the restrained love expressed by Lee and his family; fishing, buying furniture, just driving the nephew in the car. Even Dr.Bethany's words explaining ""cardiomyal weakness,"" her empathy - down to the awkward elevator scene of the new male attending doctor who didn't have the same history with Lee's family but his attempt to show basic human decency to Lee by not even speaking. 

We plot out so many things to be perfect. Like our ideal vision of high school prom, college graduation, weddings when most of us plod along like being in an amateur awkward high school band concerned with critiquing our accompanying rushing or dragging drummer when we can't even manage the timing of strumming simple chords ourselves on the guitar either. Instead we have to rely on the graciousness of others to tolerate our first clumsy attempt, and help by pulling down their pants for us and get carried on with it. 

Carrying on with it is my interpretation. In a restrained relationship, we don't necessarily have to have reached an epiphany to call or rekindle the friendship. It will still be awkward, things will feel brief and negative feelings, unresolved stuff will bubble up; and any detente, reproachment may still fall short or could end abruptly. But moments are what we have and are too brief/precious for us to hide ourselves in and not take the opportunity to make asses out of ourselves. ",5hi9i5
dbquvq3,"Did anyone else think that Lee was actually a really smart guy? Not that that's a surprise because he's working-class or anything, but a surprise as in out-of-the-ordinary smart. Like when he's talking with Randi about how he had 7 beers in 8 hours on the boat and figures out the beer/hour rate to like 5 decimal points in his head in 3 seconds. Or how he's the only one who can seem to remember the damn town his aunt and uncle moved to in Minnesota.

decgqv5,"The movie is fantastic for many reasons - pace, acting, realism, etc. I want to touch on just one facet of why it was so good; its accurate depiction of grief and death. I've faced a number of losses in my life and I thought this movie touched well on so many of the things that happen after someone dies. All the little details regarding going to appointments and making decisions were spot on. Here are a few I noticed and wanted to mention off the top of my head. 


* Lee not knowing he was to be taking in his nephew Patrick, despite Joe putting it in the will


* Patrick's friends not really understanding how to deal with the situation and instead making jokes and trying to cheer him up and getting caught up in the banality of normal life. As well, Patrick going along with it because he feels like he's supposed to or wants to avoid the shitty feelings himself.


* The understated love that exists but is not as noticeable because of the circumstances and people's own insecurities and grief. People in the real world have trouble expressing their thoughts and ideas normally, nevermind when it comes to grief. I thought this captured it well.


* The lack of eureka moment. Often grief takes time to process and sometimes may take years. It is sometimes easier to push it all away instead of trying to work through it and deal with it.


* The sleepless nights that no one else has a window into. 


* The outbursts of violence - especially when drinking. If grief is left without being addressed, the pain and anger comes out when all internal guards are down. 


There were many more. This was the most accurate depiction of grief and death I've ever seen in a movie and as I sat in the theatre it brought me back to my sixteen year old self who had lost his father. And it has gotten me reflecting and thinking of how I dealt with grief and continue to. These days, it's not too often a movie has that affect and for that I have to say it was fantastic. ",5hi9i5

dgb74mt,"We are a group of counselors who do a podcast on **Mental Illness in Pop Culture.** As I've read through the comments on this thread, I strongly agree on the issue of emotion as related to masculine identity, and Lee's only ability to express rage while having the inability to allow himself to experience pleasure. We just recorded a podcast about *Manchester,* available at https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/mentalillnessinpopculture/episodes/2017-04-15T13_51_20-07_00

We explore abandonment, complex grief, depression, pain, New England masculine identity, forgiveness, dysfunctional coping strategies, anhedonia, family trauma, binge drinking, lack of professional helping, and acceptance of personal limitations in the Academy-Award-winning film Manchester by the Sea. We consider the film perhaps one of the saddest movies ever made and a realistic portrayal of the human condition.

We acknowledge Lee “doing the best he can” despite many flaws and shortcomings in the aftermath of tragedy. We also applaud the refusal to “tie everything up in a neat bow” with a Hollywood ending. Still, we reflect on Lee’s subtle development and transformation through his relationship with Patty, hinting at the potential for eventual hope.

Patrick wanted his Uncle to stay and he had been through so much and admitted that he could not do it after everything that had happened, but just that final scene where he tells him he's looking for an extra bedroom so Patrick can visit made me happy.

Every character felt so real and fleshed out but I thought the Patrick character brought a lot of humour and depth to the story and Hedges deserves a lot of attention for that. I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing what he does in the future.

Side note: I was SO glad that there wasn't any unnecessary ""you're not my real dad"" drama between Lee and Patrick.

de6ecgd,"During the ""Lets get lunch some time scene"" when he keeps saying ""There's nothing.."" and Carey keeps cutting him off or he keep stamering, at first you think he's trying to say ""There's nothing you need to say, you don't have to say sorry"" or something to that effect.

But his none reaction to the sorry just made me think that he saying ""There's nothing to say sorry too, I'm not that person anymore. I have nothing in me anymore"" he's essentially considers himself as a husk of a person. His grief is so profound it's stripped him of himself completely.

As well at the end when he tells Patrick to ""just let it go"" about the ball. Lee gives him an inch with playing with the ball and Patrick tries to get a mile but Lee just doesn't have anything else to give. 

That's how I saw it at least. This movie was incredible. ",5hi9i5
db4ddh3,"I watched the movie twice, and I liked it quite a bit. Although, frankly, the second viewing didn't make me love the movie that much more than I already did. 

And I think that was due to the score, and how intrusive I felt it to be, especially in the first half. There were so many scenes I just wish were silent. I thought the music kinda didn't allow me to breathe and absorb the scene as much as I wanted. Eg.: [When Lee and Joe were at Lee's burned-down home and Lee's sees one of his kids being removed in a bodybag. I feel toned down music or even silence would've helped the scene better.](#spoiler) I do remember reading that Lonergan was purposeful with this as he wanted the music the be representative of what Lee no longer felt and had in his life. While this does help provide some perspective, I still personally feel some scenes would've been aided more by something more complimentary.

Small thing I noticed: [in the bit where Patty is reading the e-mail from his mom's fiancé, there's another e-mail of Sylvia asking him to prom. Totally a small thing, but says something about the Patty-Sylvia relationship given that she asked him out through e-mail.](#spoiler)

Another thing I really, really loved in the opening and closing scenes. [The similarities are obvious: the Chandlers are fishing together on their boat. It's worthwhile to notice what is missing now in the final scene. One, the father, and two, that long white vertical pole railing thing at the back of the boat (which I presume was some sort of protective railing so kid Patty doesn't fall overboard). It's an interesting set design element that invites us to remember what was lost and what it used to mean to both Patty and Lee.](#spoiler)

One thing I didn't get: [there's this one scene where Sandy and Patty are walking into a house, and she mentions that she knows about his second girlfriend. Yet the next scene is them in bed after having sex. Why? How was she cool about her boyfriend cheating about her? Of course, this isn't a big thing, but I'm still left a little wondering haha.](#spoiler)",5hi9i5

The movie is a masterclass in acting, if I may say so. Both Casey Affleck and the actor who played Patrick (can't remember his name) were great. I felt like the director was aware that without magnificent performances, the movie would fail miserably. 

There were moments in which the camera lingered on people, which felt sort of awkward as we as an audience are not use to this gaps, but they also allowed the actors to show the full lenghts of the emotions they were portraying.

While the story unfolds I was thinking to myself: how can this man ever be happy again? In a way he cant. He is dead for a long time and now he is punishing himself every waking moment with the pain his actions caused. When he talked to the police and they said to him that he is free to go he couldnt understand it. He wanted to be punished like he wants to be beaten up in the bar fights. 

When he talked to his ex wife and she apologized for the things she said to him he couldnt no he didnt want to handle it.

What Lonergan does can best be described as an attempt to capture the feeling of ""sonder"" through cinema.  He puts his protagonists in the background of scenes essentially starring side characters, has them drop in late and leave early, so their stories play out in a fully realized world, like a series of candid moments casually observed by a random passerby (Lonergan himself has a cameo in one such role).

Anyways, I just finished this movie and some of the scenes and emotions on screen were too real. Affleck did such a good job portraying Lee and his struggle with staying in Manchester. 

I've been in a similar situation where you just cant be in a place because everything there reminds you of a certain event or a certain person. Its just a feeling you get in your bones that tells you ""this isn't right anymore"". Affleck hit the nail on the head with that for me. 

I think this is a movie that pretty much anyone can go into and relate to a scene or part of the movie because of the raw realness of it. There are some people in this thread saying the plot had no real character development or no real plot. Personally, I think thats more of an advantage than not because grief is not something that moves away quickly. It can linger for months or even years. So by not forcing the plot to jump forward or fostering insanely rapid character development, this movie does a good job off illustrating what grief can really be like, a long, drawn out, and arduous road to recovery.

ddvw9qr,haven't seen anyone talk about this but what always seemed kind of confusing for me is that Patrick never really suffers (besides the panic attack) about the loss of his dad.

A few days after viewing, i'm still replaying scenes and how/why Lee handled certain situations. That's a testament of a good film, still thinking about it and questioning the emotions felt. Casey Affleck did a superb job, Lucas Hedges held his own (but not as amazing as everyone is making the performance out to be).

dek2z7x,"I thought the acting was good in this film and I understand that the it is supposed to be realistic to what life would be like for someone like Lee who lost his kids in a fire he caused plus his dad and then his brother. But God was this moving boring. 
   Lee is literally the exact same person at the start of the movie as he is at the end. He starts out as a lonely janitor in Boston who gets into drunken bar fights. He ends the movie returning to Boston as a lonely janitor who gets into drunken bar fights. Lee starts the movie not wanting to live with his nephew and trying to dump him off on his family friends. The movie ends with him not wanting to live with his nephew and dumping him off on his family friends. His ex wife attempts to reconnect with him and he refuses. 
    I totally get that in real life, that's how a person would act but that doesn't mean I want to watch it for 2 hours.
      There's a scene in Adaptation where Charlie Kaufman (played by nick cage)  goes to a screen writing seminar. During the q&a he tells the speaker (played by Brian cox) he is trying to make a movie more real to life where the characters don't change, they don't have any epiphany's, more resembling real life. Brian Cox goes off on him that he will bore his audience to death, that the characters must evolve and that his final act must wow them in the end. 
     I immediately thought of this scene at the end of Manchester. The characters are all the same at the end as they were at the beginning and then it just ended. I don't get what people liked about this besides the acting.  
    I think this would be better as a TV series that follows Lee over several seasons so maybe we could see some evolution to his character but not rush it unrealistically in a 2 hour movie. Either way, this one was not for me ",5hi9i5
db5w1yc,"I thought it was slow and in need of editing and streamlining.

Tonally, it was all over the place -- the non-linear storytelling approach didn't work too well, either -- I was unfortunate enough to be catching a matinee and about half a dozen times I heard different old couples clarifying things for each other in the theater.

Honestly I really think if they'd cut 30 minutes out of it to lose some of the dead space, it would've been better.  There were even a bunch of random B-roll shots that they occasionally cut to for no reason.

It just felt kinda forced, honestly.  It felt like they were trying to make the most artful film they could -- with all the long pauses and all the people talking over each other.  But there were times when I couldn't hear what people said and it was just 'yelling.'

The tone really bothered me -- so relentlessly heavy yet they've got bizarre scenes like the one with Patrick and the doll house.  I get the need for comic relief in a heavy film, but a lot of times it fell flat.

I didn't much like how Lee's character didn't really have an arc.  Beginning of the movie, we see him break out in a bar brawl.  End of the movie, same thing.  

Matthew Broderick was so outrageously miscast.  Several people in the theater broke out laughing.

Towards the end, things really started to feel like they were being wrapped up -- lot of scenes just happening and not leading to one another -- just events happening in sequence.

I also think the movie shows you several angles that Lee Chandler is the cause of all his inabilities and shortcomings. He KILLED HIS KIDS; you are not supposed to feel bad for him. Right from the jump I think the film lets you know that no matter what Lee is going to make the worst possible decision for himself--He punches a dude in the face rather than flirt with the spilled-drink girl.

dbahom1,"So I liked the film - but I certainly didn't love it. I am surprised it is getting as much critical acclaim as it has. 

I gave it a total 7.5 out of 10, but don't get me wrong this is a good film, I am just a harsh critic!

9/10 for the performances, 8/10 for the writing, 8/10 for directing, 4/10 for editing

The dialogue and the performances carry this film.  

Casey Affleck was great. I'd never thought of him as a superb actor but this film definitely makes his case.  

Michelle Williams probably handed in the best performance, despite such little screen time. 

CJ Wilson and his brown jackets add that dash of New England authenticity to every scene he is in.  I feel like he was the *salt* of this film. 

I thought the interview/police station scene after the fire was very much on point, you could see the guilt and shame being shoveled onto Lee's shoulders. 

My qualms --

The Patrick character came off as a bit disingenuous.  The character seemed a little too jaded/wise/adult for a semi-bereft 16 year old.  I feel like a good percentage of his dialogue was a pandering to the adult audience.  Don't get me wrong I really liked the character, it certainly added the needed brevity to a film with such a grey setting and subject matter, but I didn't buy the character as being authentic. 

The pacing was slow, even for a film of this genre. 

Matthew Broderick's character was a bit obtuse.  His performance was good, but the lunch scene took the film off track for a few minutes.  

Could have left both of the Tate Donovan scenes out entirely and the film wouldn't change a bit. 

Still trying to figure out the reasoning/purpose of Lee's random acts of violence. 

I am usually a big fan of open ended endings, but this one was a little too abrupt for my taste (just my opinion) - I could have used a just a little more closure. ",5hi9i5

dbaq220,"Holy crap, this was so bleak. One theme seemed to be, ""some people just shouldn't be parents."" Which is...sort of compelling, I guess.

Technically, my main issue was the soundtrack. During the most emotional scene (and throughout the movie) the organ music took me out of the moment. 

Additionally, I think a better movie would have ""implied"" more than literally showing the dead children's body bags. I think showing the house in fire, Michelle getting held back by firemen, then cut to the confession at the police dept, with maybe a lightning fast flashback of the fire again would have been more subtle.

I did like Michelle Williams and the actor who played Patrick, as well as the narrative structure with selective flashbacks. Casey Affleck was a little one-note for me.

It was a fine movie, but I don't get why it's leading awards noms and at the top of critics' lists. I can handle a little bleak, but this was too much to the point where you wonder what the point of all the suffering is.",5hi9i5

When he says he's not going to college at the end, I felt disappointed in him but at the same time I couldn't really blame him.

db6298m,"All the way up until the [housefire scene](#spoiler), I was getting bored and thinking ""maybe this is just Oscar bait and nothing more."" But man, did that scene really get me into the story and the character of Lee. It was heart wrenching to watch. Casey Affleck's performance was so haunting and felt so genuine that as of right now he's my top pick for Best Actor this year. Maybe I need a second viewing or it needs to sit with me a bit longer, but I didn't find Michelle Williams' performance to be super spectacular. It was a great job she did for sure and I enjoyed her in the role, but I just don't feel like it seems a lot of others do in that it was ""groundbreaking"" or ""her best work ever"". Idk. Also, I felt like the most moving/entertaining parts of the film are all in the flashback scenes. As I was watching it seemed like my cinematic brain turned bright during flashback scenes and then kind of leveled back down or ""turned dim"" during the present-day scenes. Which kind of makes me think some of the film's pacing could have been improved. With that said though, I can't say definitively that I truly believe either of these critiques to be true (Williams' performance being less than spectacular and the pacing being off). I need a second viewing to be able to finalize my opinions on both of these aspects. Overall, I give Manchester by the Sea an 8/10 and I think it's one of the best films of the year. Terrific screenplay, beautiful cinematography, top-notch acting. Worth a trip to the big screen to see it!

I still haven't figured out what to make of Matthew Broderick's role in the film. The whole theater all kind of laughed when he appeared on screen. Y'all think he was the right choice or no? What'd you think of how he was used in the movie?",5hi9i5

db70put,"Well shit. I loved the script when I read it, but the movie just did not work for me. I liked You Can Count On Me, didn't like Margaret, and I just think that I don't care for Lonergan's style.

I don't know if maybe it's supposed to feel that way, but the one word that came to my mind for most of the movie (until the last third) was ""lethargic"", felt dead to me, flaccid, very real in a way, and maybe unnerving for that reason.

The very simple look and direction of the film don't help, it just doesn't feel cinematic to me (don't downvote :D ).

When the fire scene happens, I expected it a lot from it after reading it on the page, and onscreen, it just felt to me absolutely mundane, the music in that scene was so wrong and obnoxious, I read some comments on Twitter by some guy saying the final cut of the movie was ""ruined"" by the score, implying that there was some added music compared to the Sundance cut and that might be it.

That scene should feel emotional as hell, more dramatic (well, the movie avoids that at all costs, I get it), more cinematic, I was so disappointed by that.

It just lacks life, I felt like there was no life to it....... until that last third and especially that heartbreaking scene between Lee & Randi, it's funny because it's the first scene where Lee shows something for the first time really, and coincidentally, that's where I felt something. So, I don't know, maybe the movie is supposed to feel that way? But I quite like the last third.

Affleck is of course excellent, he's the frontrunner for the Oscar, sweeping every award ceremony but I have to admit that the restraint of the film, of not being this overblown dramatic thing like many movies are, worked on the page for me but ultimately the execution did not until that last third, and when Affleck gets to finally show his emotions, that's when he soars. 

Hedges excellent too, very funny.

I did have one question - there was a moment when Lee was driving to Beverly right after he got the call about Joe where it cuts to him in a short-sleeved yellow shirt looking over the sea (I'm assuming at Manchester). At first, I thought he had stopped for a second but it didn't make sense (different shirt and why would he be stopping when the matter at hand was so urgent). I think at this point, we hadn't had too many (if any?) flashback scenes, so it only dawned upon me later that it wasn't in the same sequential timing as the driving scene.

Was this meant to be a flashback or flashforward? What was the purpose? In a movie that had so much meaning and thought with every scene and how it was framed, this one left me a little puzzled. Can anyone shed some light here?",5hi9i5

The performances are great, but the direction and the editing hurt the film for me. The editing actually gets in the way of the film, while the direction merely does nothing to improve the film.


The editing is totally uneven. At times, the camera sits staring at characters as awkward moments pass or they wait for someone to return. At other times, scenes end mid-conversation, cutting away for no discernible reason and leaving out information.

The direction is uninspired, as far as I could tell. Nothing about it surprised me or made me appreciate it. A lot of the scenes have really boring direction, using one or two camera angles and just switching back and forth. Also, an utterly out of place slow-motion scene at a funeral that went on... and on... and on.

Finally, the music was way over the top. During tragic moments, the classical music soundtrack blared for minutes at a time. The filmmakers should have been confident enough in their work to let it stand without such heavy music.

I know this post is mostly negative, but these are the things I'm interested in hearing responses to. Overall, I liked the movie, but I just don't think it should be considered a masterpiece. ",5hi9i5

I was pretty tore up, almost lost my Uber due to ""Smelling like a Fraternity"". Anywho, this movie was really, really good. Its Oscar Bait, and film snobs are going to circle jerk this movie off all year. 

Watch it if like the trailer. The only downside of this movie is probably a little lengthy and Casey Affleck's punchable face. I don't hate the guy I just can't stand his face. Great Actor really coming out of his brothers shadow, still want to smack him in the face with a sack of black beans from my supermarket.

",5hi9i5
deb8zxt,"Reading the script, I have to say that I think this movie was originally intended to be more optimistic than it turned out to be in the end. I think that actually hearing the actors say the lines and act as they are described to definitely changed the tone of the movie, and I find that interesting. On screen, the loss feels more poignant, and palpable, and I personally intetpret this... very negatively.

Ultimately, when Lee says that he has nothing left and that he can't move on or continue to live in the town he lost his family in, I can't see any way for him to go on. The awkward distances between the characters and how much they will actually do for one another highlights a loneliness that is hard to describe. Patrick's girlfriend's mom can't sit and talk with Lee because of the awkwardness, Patrick's mom won't take him in, nor Lee; do any of these people even care for each other at all? It seems that when anyone tries to reach out, it never works. Lee's wife says it herself: her heart is broken forever. 

At the end, when Lee talks to his father's friend, I thought I knew how the story would end. He says his father ""went out one morning, little bit of weather, nothing dramatic. Never came back. No signal. No may day. No one ever knew what happened."" I thought for sure that Lee was going to go out to sea, and drift away from ""real life."" Figuratively, he definitely has. He's a shell of a human. He's going to live in Boston, alone. But I though maybe he'd hop on that boat and make it more literal. 
The entire movie is summed up in this quote. It's a little bit of weather - nothing dramatic. To the people complaining that ""nothing happens"" or that there's ""no character developement"".... this movie is like watching rain drip down your window pane. Nothing changes, but it's soft and watchable and kind of beautiful. 
The quote also sums up the death of Lee's brother. His condition made it so that his death was not a surprise. It was forecasted before it happened. Just a bit of weather. And he tried to save Lee from his own storm by forcing him to connect with Patrick, but it didn't work because Lee is stuck in a rut that he may never crawl out of. It's more likely than anything that he'll disappear just like that guy's father. 
The metaphor of the boat, stuck in the harbor with no one to use it; Lee's refusal to any offers of lunch/dinner/love; Lee shoveling and shoveling the snow away; everything here is purposefully stagnant. 

One last thing, I'm gonna wonder forever about why the hockey players/coach were interested in Lee.. I'm guessing he was a star player in high school  (?) but I'm not entirely sure. I thought that would be elaborated on, and it's interesting that it wasn't. ",5hi9i5

Lee is either a drunk dick or a mopey dick, that's it. No character growth. No real story. Basically a waste of two hours. Honestly, I feel some pride for being able to stay awake for it all. 

I feel like this movie's good reviews are because it seems, on the surface like a deep, well made film. In actuality though, it is utter shite. Basically a Zach Braff movie without an indie rock soundtrack.

db10e25,"[From my heavily hated post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5e4h0d/manchester_by_the_sea_i_dont_wanna_talk_about_it/) I made about this 2 weeks ago:

I saw Manchester By The Sea this weekend. My opinion will be in the bottom 1% of what this sub thinks of it.

As a longtime fan of Casey Affleck, and a starving film lover who has seen precisely 1 truly great movie in the last 2 years (Mad Max: Fury Road, before that I would say Birdman and Whiplash), I made the trip across the Hudson to see Manchester by the Sea after a 99% Rotten Tomatoes rating.

2 1/2 hours later, I felt the same exact way as Casey Affleck coming home to see his house burned down with all his children in it.
I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.

It's the kind of movie I hate the most - a film where not very much happens, and that's supposed to be ""edgy"" and ""cool"" and all of the film elitists will swoon and call it ""brilliant"" because they think they can see something we all don't.
I've seen this phenomenon with Boyhood, The Master, Inside Llewynn Davis, Synecdoche NY, Enemy and There Will Be Blood.
It's considered ""gritty"" or ""realistic"" to have a film where not much happens. Let the audience fill in the blanks.

Casey Affleck experiences the most horrifying event anyone can imagine, and we have 2 1/2 hours of him saying or doing nothing, and responding with ""I don't wanna talk about it"" or ""I gotta go"" to every possible conversation or conflict. There is no real dramatic scene. No true revelations.

He never changes from beginning to end. And the film drags you along the way.

I'm sure the screenwriter thought a big, dramatic awakening scene would be too ""unrealistic"".

When the final, anticlimatic ""fuck you, audience"" scene occurred, I literally shook my head in disgust and said ""oh come on"" out loud.

I'm reminded of the great Adaptation by Charlie Kaufman. When Nic Cage goes to the screenwriter and says ""I want to make a film where nothing much happens, much like in the real world."" And the guy says (paraphrasing) ""The real world? The real fucking world? Things happen everyday. Every fuckin' day, a mother gets beaten to death in front of her son on the steps of a church, someone goes hungry, a man betrays his best friend for a woman. If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend don't know crap about life!""
Manchester By The Sea is flat-out boring. It's 2 1/2 hours of waiting for something to happen that never happens.

Bring back real movies.",5hi9i5
deh42qv,"Am I the only one who thinks that this movie was ungodly boring and sleep inducing? I'm no fan of rapid action, explosions and quick cuts, I enjoy thoughtful slow movies with good plots (which is what I expected coming in), but god this movie was hard to sit through. The plot just seemed long, plodding and depressing to boot. Plus it had no resolution in the end. 0 re-watch-ability IMO.  All it really is about is a guy down in the dumps for about 2 hours and goes nowhere with it. Even then, I couldn't even feel bad for Affleck's character because his character is wooden throughout and doesn't breakdown or show any ""real"" emotion at any point. In fact all the characters express very unrealistic reactions sometimes.

It was borderline unwatchable and certainly not deserving of the insane hype and an Oscar nomination. Why is this so critically acclaimed? Between this and the equally boring but critically acclaimed Moonlight, it's like I watched  entirely different movies from a parallel universe or something...Could it be that these movies exist exclusively as Oscar bait where being depressing and boring is somehow being conflated with being profound?",5hi9i5

I thought some of the pacing was off but the message and writing was stellar. I haven't seen any previous Lonergan films so I'll definitely check-out his work now. I'm thankful they didn't fall into any easy answers, but instead allowed the characters to follow natural arcs and grow and change the way they needed to. Definitely a movie you have to see with the expectation that it's a slow, slow film, but is an exploration that we should all allow ourselves to take. Looking forward to award season to see if Affleck gets the recognition he deserves. 

Also, even though Kyle Chandler's scenes were limited, he absolutely crushed it. All the performances during the police department scene absolutely floored me. ",5hi9i5

db1m971,"I'm trying to decide exactly how I feel about this movie. I definitely enjoyed it, and I would definitely recommend it, so don't take this as a dislike post. Certainly the performances were outstanding, and I thought it was very well written. I really thought Lonergan struck a great balance between drama and comedy. This movie could've easily become a melodrama, but the comedy and the subtle performances resisted that territory, which I thought was a great creative choice.

However, I didn't really feel like it ventured into any new territory. Other than the scenic shots (which were admittedly beautiful), it didn't really feel very visually daring. If someone could offer me any insight on this that I'm missing, I'd love to hear it. 

In terms of plot, it was compelling and well structured, but not exactly innovative. There have been many movies about grief over the years, and nothing about this one separated itself from those in my eyes. It was well executed, so I guess it'd be amongst the better of these types of films, but I guess it just didn't hit me quite as deeply as I wanted it to.

Anyway, like I said, I don't mean to sound like I dislike the film. I really enjoyed it, it just wasn't among my few favorites of the year so far.

If he was so 'resilient' he could still go about trying to have sex with that one girl, why didn't he 'use' grief over his father's death as a sympathy play? This whole storyline seemed really unfocused to me and not completely thought out.

For all the issues I had with the film though, I appreciate what is was NOT. Most films like this are about people overcoming obstacles, while a few are tragedies where people completely fail. This is like something inbetween, a guy who fails to resolve his problem, yet makes an effort to meet the problem halfway - so it is neither a sad nor a happy ending.",5hi9i5

For that reason, although it ties with La La Land and Moonlight as the best films of the year for me, it won't be the first one that I recommend to other people.

I honestly don't understand why I put myself through this twice really. Each time I really sobbed through the tragic fire/police station sequence, and I mean both times, even when I knew what was coming the second time. The last time that I cried this badly was last year's Room. And the last time that I still cried after fully knowing what's gonna happen was, well it has never happened. Suffice to say that, with all the editing problem this movie has, that sequence was just incredible combining with its score and all the cutting between past and present.

Also, at about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, this film is actually a very easy sit.

db51prb,"I'm from Manchester. The original. The UK Manchester. Some would say the *real* Manchester. Its famous for being grey and rainy - and not near Essex. Nor by the sea. But, despite the weather, we make the best of it. I love this city. It is vibrant, youthful, energetic and positive. 

It is everything this film isn't. 

MbtS was an over-long 2.5 hour TV-movie melodrama - but without any dazzling, shouty ad breaks every 15 minutes to inject a bit of life back into the viewer.

I was bored silly. 

When I go to see a film I want to feel something (other than boredom). I don't care if that's sadness, revulsion, fear, elation, etc - I just want to feel. Yes, the disconnected numbness felt when viewing MbtS could be analogous to Casey Affleck's withdrawn character, but, I'm sorry, that doesn't translate to an arresting cinema going experience.

It comes to something when the most memorable character was the girl overheard telling her friend how she wanted to fuck Affleck as he unclogged her toilet. Unfortunately she was only in MbtS for 30 seconds. Everyone else, without exception, was bland, lifeless and tedious. 

*""Tedious""*.

That's the perfect word to describe this film. 

When a character movie has such dreary characters, the film fails. I couldn't engage with anyone. They're all so lazily written, monotonously acted and badly realised. 

Let's get one thing straight; a lack of emotion does not display Oscar-worthy range. It is not subtlety. It is not grounded. It is *not* to be applauded. A snotty, whiny apology with sadface is not good acting. Punching undeserving people in bars is not powerful drama. Driving an entitled teenager around a miserable town in a dull red truck is not entertainment. 

The lead is Affleck. He can't seem to keep away from tragedy, but he tries by avoiding conversation and drowning his sorrows in drink. A nuanced and original character he is not. 

The other main character is the orphaned teenage boy. Again, someone with very little emotional range. Other than the odd, unfunny wisecrack - despite a recently deceased father. Above I called him *entitled*. I fear I may be overselling him. He isn't interesting enough to earn the description. 

I saw this film only a few hours ago, but the only other characters I can recall are the brother that dies, a wife that used to drink, a [few charred kids in a bodybag](#spoiler), fat Ferris Bueller and... that's it. Everyone else is forgettable window-dressing. They are there to drag out the almost non-existent plot. 

Ah, the 'plot'. Well, boring Afflek has to look after a boring 16 year old kid after his boring brother (the kid's father) dies. That's it. For 2 and a half hours. 

Come. Follow them on their wacky adventures!

Or not.  

I'm afraid Depressing Afflek's character lost me the moment he started the first bar fight. Yes, 'first', as in there are more. 

He also fights a window. And loses.  

Normal people don't punch strangers for looking at them in a bar. That's psychotic behavior. That will get you arrested, no matter what your past tragedies. But in miserable-movie-world that's just a physical metaphor for his emotional plight. Sigh. 

From that point on I didn't care about him, his dull family, or their lazy dramas. 

And yes, [its all your fault your kids are dead](#spoiler) is about the laziest trope to give your character a tragic past.

I think the thing that truly killed it was just how easy everyone had it. There were no stakes. They were all devoid of struggle. No one had any real-world problems - beyond the dead family members. [The worm-food dad left the kid a huge paid-off house, a boat, and lots of cash to help Misery Afflek look after him, FFS.](#spoiler) 

[Their worst quandary was deciding what to do with the inherited boat. You see, it had an engine that really needed replacing, but the cash wasn't immediately available. Until it was. When they found the dad's presumably antique guns to sell.](#spoiler)

[I say found. They were in a moodily lit display cabinet in the house all along.](#spoiler) 

""But what about all the dead people."" I hear the menopausal MbtS fans shreik. You know, dying family members come up, but it doesn't seem to be all that relevant to the plot. No one seems all that affected by the deaths. They mourn in their own, boring, guarded ways - but so what? If they had to deal with that on top of financial troubles, or a criminal past, *or anything* then that could have been interesting, but 'interesting' was notably absent from MbtS. 

[I think the interview after the fire scene summed it up perfectly. Moaning Afflek is surprised that he can go free, despite killing three kids in an accident. That's it. A little suicidal emotional outburst is end-scene. Done. No need to revisit.](#spoiler) 

[Couldn't there have been maybe some suspicion of arson? Maybe the investigation was ongoing when he was forced to return to Manchester? Maybe the emotional weight of having to deal with dead children on top of the town's suspicious eyes would have given this film a layer of depth it cried out for?](#spoiler) 

[But no. That would have been skirting too close to the fires of plot. We've had enough of fire, thank you very much.](#spoiler) So back to the grey, uneventful, bleak dullness of it all. 

Here's the thing; if I don't care about the characters, I don't care about their apparent hidden anguish in a plot-less film. When a disconnect like the first groansome bar fight, or Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Diet, rips you out of the movie - why care what's going through these character's minds? They become just that - characters. Actors playing make believe. The film fails when all I see is pretense through the mucus. 

I could go on, but - unlike this movie - I know when to stop.

On the plus side, Casey Affleck was amazing and compelling. Kyle Chandler is always strong and the entire cast was talented. 

However -- the melodrama and pathos was just ridiculous. I was in a full theater and the audience chuckled and giggled as the music swelled during the pivotal post-fire scene. More laughs as Casey Affleck confronted Michelle Williams at the end. It was overwrought and unrealistic as written and scored. I personally felt that the movie was a poorly executed attempt at manipulation rather than a compelling story. 

Horrific tragedy in film is tough but when executed well (""Sophie's Choice"", for example) it's thought provoking and cathartic. This was just hamfisted and  a poor use of an incredibly talented leading man.

After all the hype surrounding Moonlight, I saw it last weekend. I have to say i forced myself through it. It wasn't bad, it was a good movie, well-made and acted, and ""important"" in the story it depicts, but I wouldn't ever see it again.

As for Manchester, well, for sad movies like Atonement, I would usually never want to see them again. But Manchester was so good, I saw it three times --once every day in the last week. It's in a completely different league IMO. It's depiction of sadness is just so real and profound.",5hi9i5
db44715,"> When Lee says he can't beat it, he means he can't ever get past his trauma and embrace the opportunity to be a parent again (especially when his drinking leads to a fire scare that could have endangered Patrick). He does feel responsibility to his brother but has to find a balance between taking care of his nephew and avoiding his demons.

This is crucial to the film, I think.  On paper, the scenario of the film's story would seem to set up a redemption story for Lee, where he finally finds the courage to be a parent figure again.  But remember, the fire *was* a result of Lee's negligence, and he just might not be fit to be that kind of figure.  The important part is that he contends with this and finds out on his own.  You get the sense that this is the first time Lee actually gets to know himself in the context of other people since the fire, and by the end he comes to understand what he's capable of and what he's not.  That's the real victory for him, along with finally developing a positive relationship with another person, even if it isn't one that somehow symbolically redeems his guilt and trauma.",5hi9i5

The way the movie captures that feeling of severe distance and total emotional withdrawal after a tragedy is so razor sharp and I haven't experienced a more emotionally relatable and piercing moving this year (IMO).

I totally agree. All of us carry these wounds. They shape and define who we are. Just because we don't have something as sad as this happen to us doesn't mean we aren't restricted and impacted by our experiences and incapacity to process and learn and move on. And so despite no cathartic release and then a new direction and happy ending sometime later, the glimmer was enough, given that there is humor throughout and this is life for some (many/all) people.

To get spiritual, it's up to him to figure out the meaning of those events, and his connection to his family going forward. At all times we have a choice to be more open and loving, or to cower and protect ourselves (and sometimes protection is the best coping strategy we have at that moment). Depending on our religion, perhaps it was all meant to happen that way; perhaps this is his lesson if he can find the will to learn what he needs to to end his suffering (for example Randi is moving on, even though her heart wrt the daughters and their marriage is broken). To quote Rumi:  “You have to keep breaking your heart until it opens.”

Plus, who's to say there wasn't a media frenzy and litigation off camera? There most likely was, but it was just not interesting enough. After all, his ex-wife apologizes for saying things to him for which she deserves ""to go to hell"", but we don't know what those things are. There's a lot untold about this story for a good reason.

This movie reminded me a lot of In the Bedroom, which actually involved some of the legal procedural effects of death, but didn't really care what anybody who wasn't involved would hear about the case. What you're suggesting would have turned the film into Gone Girl. Which I loved, but for different reasons.",5hi9i5

dd7n8hy,"A very good film indeed. I think a good male actor can pretty much do 'anger' but to do 'emptiness' in the way Affleck does it, deserves all the plaudits.

By the way the final music is from Massenet's Cherubin. The translation of the whole aria (though only the first line or two is sung) is below. This gives me hope that Lee can and will love, despite the hopelessness you feel for him.

""When you have nothing to do, summon me quickly next to you 
The paradise that I prefer, It's a cushion at your knees. 
You will hardly notice me, I will not speak ...
And I will hold my breath, If my breath can disturb you. 
So that in my gloomy heart, Winter makes way for spring. 
I ask very little: A smile from time to time.
And if it's too much a look will suffice to transform me.
For without saying anything I love you
As much as a being can love""
",5hi9i5
ddj7dtb,"I think people expected a ""movie"" ending. This film absolutely had a narrative arc and resolution though. While Lee is unable to beat his demons and can't stay in Manchester, he's able to make a little bit of room for another person in his life again, and find some shred of reason to keep breathing. Anything more than that would have been unrealistic, considering what he went through.",5hi9i5
dg11exl,"One more glaring plot development that stood out to me was how Randi was able to move on (materially, if not emotionally) from the tragedy and how Lee was basically still in the purgatory he had put himself in. I know for Lee the tragedy cut deep for him as he had placed the blame on himself for it, in a way ""failing"" in his role as a responsible adult and his role as a man and father as protector of his children. Consequently, you could read the situation as Randi being he victim of the tragedy and Lee being the cause (and also victim). Judging from the reception from some of the locals they might well share that view.

But for me it still highlights the discrepancy between how male and female vulnerability are received in broader society. How did Randi end up with a new partner, new household to settle down in and a newborn child? She couldn't have done so without revealing some if not all of the details of her previous life, and subsequently receiving all the sympathy and support she clearly deserves from family members, wider society and of course her new partner. Why has Lee not been able to build a new life in similar fashion? 

He hasn't received the same support, whether he has refused it or it has not been available. He wears a heavy burden of being a failure as a man, that he places on himself and that society places on him. I even felt Patrick was somewhat unsympathetic to his plight throughout most of the movie, until that poignant moment he stops to look closely at the framed pictures Lee keeps of his children, only then choosing to act in a more thoughtful manner towards him.

I thought the screenwriter was very shrewd in how he only ever showed the male characters breaking down twice, once after Lee has that gut-wrenching encounter with Randi and once after Patrick is told by Lee that he can't stick around to be his guardian. I think by only seeing those emotions truly overcome our male protagonists at these rare moments makes for a more realistic portrayal of male emotional turmoil and more impactful for the viewer.",5hi9i5
dffx16s,"I agree.

In the scene where Randi breaks down to Lee, if you look at his expressions, Casey Affleck perfectly captures the emotions Lee goes through yet struggles to show. Is it because Lee doesn't want to show them or is it because he simply doesn't know how? Brilliant movie either way. ",5hi9i5

Did he mean ""there's nothing there"" between them, that  he doesn't love her anymore, so no need to stay i touch?   
this seems the easiest interpretation but if so, why would he tell her that, to get her off his back so he won't have to relive those terrible memories?
or
Did he mean some other thing about his not having guilt about killing his daughters?
or
Did he mean there's nothing he holds against her for blaming him in the past.

You really picked up on something interesting about the Matthew Broderick character. He's clearly more interested in ""looking"" biblical rather than actually acting with empathy. If he truly studied  Christianity, I think he wouldn't act as a blockade between a teenaged son who just lost his father, and his mother. 

Honestly, the Matthew Broderick character really creeped me out from the first moment he was on screen. When he later wrote that wall of text that could be boiled down to: ""I'm controlling your mother, all in the name of her 'own good'""... it didn't surprise me, really.",5hi9i5

ddxo489,"The films plays with how people deal with tragedy, both unforseen [house fire](#spoiler) and expected [heart attack](#spoiler). Some people deal with it better like Patrick who maybe just has too many things going on in his life that he simply doesn't have time to dwell on his loss. Plus the fact that it was expected makes it a little easier. Some people run from it like Randi who presumably immediately jumped into a relationship and started a new family to pave over the memories of the old one. Then there's people like Lee who, from his perspective, had everything and it was taken literally over night. He never made an effort to actually try and move on or make new connections. He's been stuck in a kind of limbo ever since.

I think the scene with the bouncing ball at the end is very telling of how both characters attack their grief. Lee makes an attempt at play, but found when he had to put in effort to get the ball he'd rather abandon it. Patrick on the other hand ran after the ball multiple times to keep it in play. He understands the power of distraction and keeping busy. It isn't Lee that will help Patrick cope, but the other way around. Patrick is full of life and I think by the end Lee realizes that he could learn from that and that's why he makes arrangements to be able to see Patrick later on.

I think it's because both of the girlfriends were pretty undeveloped. Granted, they don't have to be, but it'll cause confusion in your case if they decide to introduce an element like this. We can't say for sure if this is out of character for Sandy because we don't know Sandy. It's possible she only wants Pat because she's sexually attracted to him and she has other boyfriends on the side. She doesn't seem particularly conservative herself, so it's not out of the scope of possibility that Patrick isn't her only boy toy. We only see Sandy and Sylvia's description through Patty; he's of course going to make himself sound like a stud. ",5hi9i5

dd22wpo,"For one, Patrick's father had been in and out of the hospital for most of his life. He was probably a little numbed by that whole process. And two, he was a kid raised by men who didn't really show much emotion. They taught him to internalize a lot of his pain. ",5hi9i5
ddhcrwv,"I think his acting was amazing! He captured a boy trying to deal with grief and loss, and not having many people around him to mirror and hold that space. Notice girlfriend1 wanting to draw out his emotions and protect him, yet not much comes out. Same with coach offering ""someone to spill your guts to"", but many boys/men aren't taught how to process emotion, and it doesn't come as naturally to us compared to women.

He's learnt emotional processing (consciously and unconsciously) from his father, particularly in the absence of an alcoholic mother. 

The scene in the freezer is a rare glimpse when some of the stored and blocked emotion rises to the surface. His pain in the chest and other physical symptoms are the unprocessed emotions under the surface, ready to be processed if he can hold the space. Unfortunately Lee can't hold that space either...in fact he is a well of unprocessed emotion triggering Randi every times she's near him. Yes she has her own feelings, but I expect given they were married there is a large amount of surrogation of emotion between them, and because he can't process his, she finds herself almost unable to control grief and other emotions in his presence.

edit:  For example, here's a [story from Conspiracy, (great film btw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZMuOhuB3Wo) - the interpretation could be different though. What if he didn't have any space and emotional safety to feel grief for the mother because of all that hate...but when the object of hate disappears, the heart can open and unresolved emotions that were blocked by having and being the hate surface.",5hi9i5

I totally get that; I too felt very sad at the end (saw the day before yesterday)  and for a moment I just looked at my companion and said WTF was that; is it over. Cause it just ends.  But then I thought about it, and what it is supposed to depict is real life and how real situations go down in the end.  Movie tropes have taught us that in this type of melodramatic family drama there is going to be either a big happy ending or a big sad ending. Real life isn't that way it's kind of somewhere in between and it doesn't end w/a curtain call or a movie ending, it just kind of meanders along. Like in MBTS.

So, WRT this specific ending, while we would expect Lee to grow and change and be all touchy-feely and be a proper guardian, in real life it just ain't that way, in such a DEFINED linear way. This particular soul was too damaged a person at that point in time to be a full-time parent.  And he knew it and he wanted the boy to have the best possible life so he made sure that he was taken care of with a close, loving family friend. All the while, making plans for the future ie getting a 1 bedroom apartment instead of the crappy studio he had; that's HUGE - this is subtle growth because heretofore he'd been living an extremely solitary life with zero room in any way for even one more person.  While he knew that he could not be full-time he made future plans to be a part-time guardian, the best that he could do because he was still extremely ill-equipped himself. His maturity was that he recognized this - he knew that he wasn't ready yet and that his nephew needed a more stable home - yet still made sure that he would continue his loving relationship with his nephew as best as he possibly could with perhaps hope for future living arrangements to change.

He goes out on the boat with his nephew: a repeat of the loving fun pasttime they used to do together in happier times. There is, for the first time in the present day scenes, a slight smile on Lee's face and definite contentment in this beloved hobby that they did together, as when they were closer years ago. This is a sign that Lee has started on the road to joy again, little bursts of joy. He is FINALLY on the road to BABY STEPS of recovery. 

So although it's a very subtle growth and we need to examine it - it is growth, there was a huge arc there from solitary recluse, to someone who sees a light at the end of the tunnel and will maintain this healthy, necessary relationship in the future in the best way he knows how. 

Remember he was suicidal at one point so this was a huge healing step for him.

Real life; this was a life changing movie, not to be missed.",5hi9i5
db17a8r,"It doesn't have a happy ending- that's true. But what you're missing is the presence of hope. When the film starts Affleck is a man who doesn't want to be alive anymore, but at the end he's a dude who has a connection with someone and gets an apartment where he can stay with him. That's *hope*",5hi9i5
db0lakq,"There was a definite juxtaposition between how Lee handles loss and how Patrick handles it, and the different kinds of loss there are.

We see Lee in his small ways make efforts about becoming a parent again (when he asks for a job at the shipping area), but directly following that scene him and Patrick have an interaction that reminds him of the kids he no longer has.

Depression and grief is crushing for him.  He just ""walks around waiting to die"".  Although it can be seen as inaction I think there is a tremendous depth to his character, and the little nuances to his actions and reactions are what truly let me know that Casey Affleck isn't asleep at the wheel but fully absorbed in the character.",5hi9i5
db2n3yo,"> what everyone got out of the film's resolution? 

My view is the film comes down in a place that is neither victory or defeat. Lee realizes he lacks the internal strength to do what's best for his nephew, but he does the next best thing in finding him guardians able to step in and do what he himself cannot. He also makes a compromise of quitting his job in Boston to be nearer to his nephew and making room for him in his new apartment to show him he is still 'there' for him as much as he can be (making him different to the mother who cannot even go that far for her son).

I love Casey Affleck but he underplayed this (blandly written) character almost to the point of total inaction. It was as bad as Tom Hardy in The Drop. This movie is an overrated dud, and if it came out in a ""real"" year like 99 or 2000, it would have come and gone with about the same fanfare as The Shipping News.

Even in her cleaned up act, she was going to be incapable of being there for him, and he learned that at the dinner.  She couldn't even sit down to a meal with him. 

The scene in the car after that meeting, when he tells Affleck's character that he'd do anything to get rid of him, that's the first time he admits in his roundabout way that he doesn't want Affleck to get rid of him.  It's one of the most important sequences in the whole film.

dboqvhi,"I think, those landscape shots were intended to depict the bleakness of the setting, or how the setting was perceived by Lee. This was a very subtle movie, and I think one of the most important lines of the movie was in between sobs of Lee's wife character when she said, ""You're a ghost."" 

This was the main point of the movie, in my opinion. [Lee couldn't live with himself for what he did, and therefore couldn't allow himself to live. However, he never received any consequences for an act that he felt was entirely his fault. This is why he starts fights when he drinks because he feels like getting his ass kicked is somehow his self-imposed punishment.](#spoiler)

dbs86vv,"I mentioned this to someone else above (below?)

> I gotta say, as someone who lived in New England for many years, the landscape felt like a character to me. I know lots of films are shot on location, but there are just so many things that make me feel ""New England"" that I don't find other places. It's a combination of the density of houses, the hills, the foliage, the white salty/grimy windshields, the rocky coastline, the tar patched roads, the angles of the power lines, the frequency of graveyards (although this was also a plot device and not just setting), etc. I really felt the presence of the setting and it really made me feel like the characters were ingrained Massachusetts working class Catholics.

I've lived several other places and have traveled all about the US and that mix of scenery is uniquely New England to me. The landscape shots really helped me identify and understand the characters because I kept feeling like ""I know these people!"" and the people and scenery were all accurate. 

The band scenes were really attention grabbing to me.  I'm not sure if I loved them or hated them.  They definitely made me feel like Patrick is just a sorta shitty (aren't we all at 16?) kid.  It also reminded me that Joe's death wasn't omnipresent for Patrick like death seemed to be for Lee.",5hi9i5

The first band scene depicted Otto (the drummer I think that's his name) who was behind on the beat. Lee also plays the same role, being behind everyone, for instance being too late to see Joe before he died or not being able to comprehend what his death means. The second band scene depicts Otto being ahead of everyone, sort of like Lee's new shift, as now he's ready to leave the town, the memories are getting to him and he is ready to rush out (but Joe's burial being delayed due to the cold is slowing him down).

dekhrcy,I moved out of Boston 3 years ago and this movie made me incredibly homesick because of how real it felt for me. ,5hi9i5
deerrt4,"I couldn't agree more. I just finished watching and I went online to find some discussions and I found [this](http://acculturated.com/manchester-by-the-sea/) article that really didn't enjoy the movie.   
It seems their main point is about the most distinct characteristic of this film, and what you pointed out, how 'real' the events are. I think each actor/actress does a great job of portraying their character, with the main characters being exceptionally well.

I think the main complaint that people who didn't enjoy the movie have is that it doesn't express the emotion of the events. I don't disagree with that completely, and I think what makes this movies special - if not for anyone else then just for me - is how it doesn't dramaticise the way the characters behave in order to get across an emotion. The movie doesn't try to pull you in, it just lets you watch the events unfold. 

They also commented, in the article, that Lee's character doesn't change in the movie, which I think is a result of trying to portray things as they would be seen if the audience was a character in that world, watching them do what they do.  
I think you can see this in where Lee's asleep and his daughter asks him if he smells something burning. When I watched him wake up and run to the kitchen, I was half expecting him to run in panic and maybe stumble or just something to show the emotional significance that the fire alarm going off would have for him. Looking back, I think the way they handled it - not spending too much time or giving too much emotional value to the scene - fits in well with the rest of the film by portraying it very realistically. From my experience, emotional moments in life are much more like this scene than they are in other, more emotionally reliant, films. 


EDIT: It also comes across when Randi and Lee meet and she apologises. It's a somewhat awkward scene but you can tell that she knows him from the way that she acts, she understands the way he is and so can expect how he'll react and also know how to deal with him.

As per the nephew, the scenes of him trying to get laid were way too long without any nuance of him grieving for his father - to the point it just seemed like a different movie to me and kind of off-putting.

I don't think Lee was supposed to have an ""arc"" per se. He was just a broken man trying to continue life knowing that he could never undo the mistakes he made. In fact, if his character did start to get better, I think it would have done the film a disservice. A great example being his awkward conversation with the mother who had a thing for him. He knew it was never going to go anywhere and she found out pretty quickly as well. No need to create an unnecessary relationship to show him overcoming anything.

As for the events wrapping up without really leading anywhere, I don't see how it could have gone any other way. Lee obviously cares for his family, but he was put into an impossible situation and didn't have the tools to deal with it.

The second time, the drummer was playing too fast.

At this point in the movie, Lee kind of just wants to dump Fred Weasly and move on.

deeyn4j,"i think stopping drinking would be a step towards trying to move on or get better or face reality and obviously as we see in the movie he's not ready to do that. 

i think the ""i'm not going to college"" part was just supposed to be this funny bit where lee is actually trying to tentatively put it out there that he's making room for patrick in his life (thus a HUGE progression of his character) and it plays on the fact that patrick still isn't there to necessarily respond appropriately to what lee is feeling so he's like ""i don't fucking care!""

Way off. So he is automatically supposed to hit on the girl even after she spilled the drink on him? (whether she did it intentionally or not)

The intent of the movie was that bad things can happen to good people, and you can still empathize with their struggles whether those bad things are a result of their character flaws or not. Your personal emotion can boil it down to ""HE KILLED HIS KIDS"" if you'd like, but what you're willingly ignore that it was a mistake, not intentional. He clearly loved his family, and the police station scene really showed he'd rather die than live with the guilt. The movie play with the trauma and empathy themes though his experience.",5hi9i5

dbb2kwn,"You make some good points.  I have a few further comments and questions for anyone.

Regarding Patrick's character: I was also thrown off by his slickness and apparent maturity level.  It occurred to me that perhaps that 'front' is part of his coping process and he doesn't fully understand his own statements/actions? 

In the lunch scene you mention, when Patrick's mother goes to the kitchen is it being implied that she is drinking?  

Also,  I'm trying to analyze the scene  when Lee is talking with Patrick and says ""I can't beat it"".  Is he speaking of his depression? Is he really without hope? What do you think he is saying there?

I think the ending IS open-ended, but not so much in regard to WHAT happens as to how that outcome is perceived by the viewer- in a positive or negative light.  I think it's fairly clear: Lee will be moving back to Boston, Patrick will be staying with George until coming of age, and they both have interest in remaining close in the future.  Personally, I see it as positive and with the possibility for a stronger family.  Lee seems to be hopeful but realizes he needs time.

Overall I really liked this film. A fun one to think on and discuss.    ",5hi9i5
deg1r32,"in reference to Lee's random acts of violence, if you look at the framing and set design and direction of the police station scene and the second bar fight scene, they're almost the exact same.

this to me is significant in solidifying the fact that Lee has not lived one day beyond the fire - his life stopped that day. and in the wake of the conversation with his ex wife, he lashes out in self-harm, just not suicidal this time. don't know why... maybe because he feels the need to keep living to punish himself, or he feels a sense of duty to Patrick, or he wants to honor his dead brother... but the reflection between those two scenes is uncanny and i think is important",5hi9i5
dd8v6jf,"The idea to me was very clearly illustrated to be the idea of attachments. When your a kid you believe your emotional attachments to other people are iron clad fixed relations. The movement goes to extremes to highlight how attachment to other people is a fluid thing. The fact the guy burns down his own house(while high on cocaine), is typical thing that shows the guy even before his kids died was struggling with how to be a consistent father. The movie shows that a kids mother hasn't really bonded with her son. That an uncle isn't bonded to the nephew. The nephew doesn't really have a deep emotional bond with his girlfriends(2). Casey's character struggles to make sense of a world where the only attachment that actually matters has been ripped apart.

You get these endless shots of scenery, of the characters talking about mundane bullshit, the kid playing in his band, the kid flirting with his girlfriends, etc, etc. Its like the filmmakers are suggesting that this is what life is really like, but it isn't. My life doesn't feel like that, at least. Even when much less is going on than in the film, there is constantly conflict, feeling, drama, etc. I don't feel like they captured that aspect of life, at all. Everything is detached and meandering. Cinematic language is meant to translate this non-physical aspect of life (feelings, emotion) onto the screen, and present visually something that is typically only felt.

dcrf8qu,"I respectfully had a different opinion.  I loved both movies.  Both were heavy, had some real despair and moving moments, and a bittersweet ending.  

Casey Affleck had an amazing performance of someone who was emotionally destroyed by his past.  He conveyed that guilt and resignation, regret, and wanting to punished.  

Moonlight really shared some great performers among a bunch of actors (my favorite being the drug dealer in the first act, the guy from House of Cards and 4400 - that guy has really improved!).  But Afleck really heald a performance through all stages of his grief, which I give a bit more admiration to.  

Both were great movies, but perhaps being a white catholic guy from the NE gave me a bit more of an ability to relate, versus a black gay male growing up in utter poverty.  

Both were able to tackle some really heavy and depressing events/lives without feeling utterly depressed at the end.  It wasn't sad for the sake of pulling the audience to tears, but more to show the beauty and pain of guilt and shame.

I wouldn't be upset if either won best picture.  But I think Affleck has surpassed his brother as a lead, has more depth (and I still like Ben despite shit pop movies).  I really hope he gets the win.

For directing, its close, but Moonlight had more of a style to it that mixed pastel colors into the story in a way that was very immersive.  

Good movie year - I just hope best picture doesn't go to Lala Land, which IMO was almost written to appeal to the Academy Awards by checking all the boxes that hollywood likes in a best picture.

I think Lonergan's theatre background might play a part as well--you get a lot of very basic shots and just let the acting do the work.

But I do disagree with your inclusion of Inside LLewyn Davis and There Will Be Blood on your list of Movies That Are Ruining Cinema. Sure they may not follow a typical 3 act plot structure, but in no way are they boring or actionless. 

""Not much happens""? You've got to be kidding me. There Will Be Blood is a masterclass in character driven conflict. The entire movie bristles with tension. And Inside LLewyn Davis is an incredibly subtle tragicomedy. It's painfully dark satire of the folk scene in Greenwich in the 60's. Here you have a man who is brimming with talent, and yet he treats everyone like shit so no one really takes him seriously. Meanwhile he's living with his partners suicide and a potential kid on the way further fucking up his life. Records a joke of a song, almost makes it big... but he took the easy pay-out to finance another abortion. Dude is trapped in a cage of his own making and he's too proud to see it. Brilliant.

What do you consider real movies? ",5hi9i5
db11b2z,"I don't think you have to be a film elitist to have enjoyed this movie. And to say that nothing happens is a bit of a stretch, yeah there are no action scenes or any big physical challenges,  because the main story is about the internal issues Casey Afflecks character is dealing with.  

 I thought his performance was great and while he didn't verbalise a lot of what he was going  through you could see it in the way he carried himself. And to me I thought the subtlety was the best part, it could have very easily been a melodramatic ham-fisted movie but I thought it gave a pretty honest approach to how people can cope with guilt and grief. But that's me, based on the other movies you mentioned maybe this just wasn't the movie for you? ",5hi9i5

But you lose all credibility for saying Fury Road is the best movie of the past 2 years. It's visually and viscerally stunning (A+ Cinematography), but how can you assail the movies above for having nothing happen, when Fury Road suffers from the same underlying issue. There is no real plot and nothing really happens in the story. You are watching a guy try and survive an onslaught for 2 hours. There is virtually no acting, no meaningful dialogue, and no character development.

I though that Affleck played the roll perfectly, It's unfathomable how devastating it would be to loose my children and have the guilt of it being my fault. I felt like his character was so haunted by this that if he let himself feel it fully he thought would be destroyed, but he continued to do the best he could to survive and do right by his nephew. That line ""I can't beat it"" really tells the whole story and was delivered perfectly.

Personally I choose to watch a 2 hour movie to be inspired, to view a character go through a journey or at the very least experience a character grow (regardless of the direction).  The main character seemed completely stoic preventing me from connecting with him and showed no real growth.  I understand some people praise it for being more honest to real life however I don't take a break from real life in to order to watch a movie about it.  

I certainly didn't expect that from a movie with such a high IMDB rating and Oscar wins/nominations.  I honestly am starting to think it's suspicious that this movie was produced by Amazon. The company that just bought IMDB and has plenty of money to push this movie down the throats of the Oscar committee.  Even on IMDB it's suspicious how the user reviews jump from 4/10 reviews to long winded 10/10 reviews.  After almost every bad review a 10/10 one pops up to negate it.  Same with the breakdown of its current 8/10 IMDB rating. When you view the individual ratings you see a massive amount of 10 rating compared to many low ratings.  It is rare for a movie to have such strongly opposing rating unless there has been outside manipulation involved. It is also rare for a movie (on IMDB) to even receive 10/10 votes.

It doesn't sound too far fetched when you consider Amazon made this movie AND it was their first one.  There was a lot on the line for Amazon to prove they could become a contender in the Internet tv/movie market.  Especially now that they are trying to compete with Netflix.",5hi9i5

2) You are more than welcome to have dissenting opinions, but no need to describe the fans of the movie as **the menopausal MbtS fans shreik.**

3) I'm not trying to garner any sympathy, but my grandfather is on the brink of death (possibly near Christmas, which I hope isn't the case) and as I get nearer and nearer to that inevitable end, I feel that I've come to accept what is to come. The characters all knew the brother's eventual death was coming, as they were told the life expectancy in the flashback was not all that long. So it can be understandable if most, if not all, were mournful but not overly emotional as you seem to want.

I find that what the movie bring is a level of truth that isn't seen in most of movies I seen this year. It's a small story, yes, but it's something I can empathize and on some level relate to. I didn't need anything else from it.  Sorry it couldn't bring you the same satisfaction.

Also the scene towards the end in which he is helping the older man fix his furnace is troubling.  When I heard the story of the man's father dying when he took his boat out in the weather that was not that bad and noone found the boat made me think that Lee got an idea here and was going to do this.

I think you make a great point about Lee getting to know himself in the context of other people, especially since he exiled himself after the fire.

And I think it's another way to show that when people try to recover from either a tragedy or addiction or whatever it doesn't happen all in one go. It's not like this Disney-fied resolution. The mom is getting better (is sober, etc) but that STILL doesn't mean that she is capable of being responsible for another human being.

 save. Which adds to the ending of the movie because it has no ending, it continues on. He just continues on.

Nobody's expecting a full change but some sort of growth is required.  Otherwise it's just a depressed character moaning for 2+ hours.  

Even just not having the barfight at the end would've shown some growth, but the choice to have it shows that Lee hasn't changed much at all despite his life being transformed, and that's very unsatisfying.

At first I wasn't sure why they had the scene with Patrick going to see his mom, etc, but I think that it really showed another example of a person working to make their life better but who can't be expected to go from 0-100. Just like Lee can't go from losing his kids to taking care of his nephew full time, Patrick's mom can't go from being a drunk to being 100% sober and ready/able to be a full time mom again. I appreciated how real it was. That healing takes time and it takes steps backwards and forwards and sideways and it's not always a Disney-style ""realization"" fix where you have a little experience that fully heals you.

also, i remember lee's ex-wife crying, ""i see you walking around... you can't just die"". implying that's exactly what he's doing- living until he dies. i predict he moves back to boston. patrick won't visit him (he will work on a boat in manchester). lee knows he can't be happy in manchester. he lost his brother, his father, his ex-wife. will fly under the radar ",5hi9i5

Ie the music in that section was just wrong, just imagine the same scene, not clumsily inserted during the visit with the lawyer and chopped up to pieces, imagine that scene playing uninterrupted, no music, it would have been so much better in my opinion. 

In a way, it felt very amateurish to me, that scene, the way it was executed, it's really funny to see that sometimes, stuff reads badly on the page, but turns into something great onscreen, and sometimes the opposite here.

Some of the other reviews mirroring my own on AW said the movie felt basic, and I understand those complaints, it does feel imo very simple, and others said that for a movie about grief, they didn't feel a thing, and same deal for me, except in that Randi-Lee scene towards the end.

But the fire scene is not enough to sway my opinion of the film itself, I would be curious to see Matt Damon's version of it had he directed it (even though he didn't direct anything yet), that script between someone else's hands I think would be,  and considering the insane critical reception will probably sound like heresy, something else.

It's the kind of symbolism-fest that makes film elitists go gaga.

You watch the movie and you leave saying: ""What did the cat symbolize? What about the 2nd cat? What about the poster on the wall? What about the man staring at him on the subway? What about the man who beat him up?""

Film elitists (I'm not calling you a film elitist, you don't sound at all snobby by how respectfully you engaged me) love it because they can't be wrong about their interpretation. Think the cat symbolizes Llewynn himself and his journey? Sure!

I loved the fact that the first scene was the same as the last and that he said ""au revoir"" which is literally translated to until I see you again ...

>But you lose all credibility for saying Fury Road is the best movie of the past 2 years. It's visually and viscerally stunning (A+ Cinematography), but how can you assail the movies above for having nothing happen, when Fury Road suffers from the same underlying issue. There is no real plot and nothing really happens in the story. You are watching a guy try and survive an onslaught for 2 hours. There is virtually no acting, no meaningful dialogue, and no character development.

I disagree, but also I should say that Fury Road stands out from any movie really of the past 15 years. I hesitate to mention how great it is, because people think I'm some Transformers junkie who just likes shit to blow up.

Mad Max Fury Road is everything that it wants itself to be. You want a fast-paced, action-packed film with amazing visuals and music? Choke it on, motherfucker. We're going to pound you with it until you submit.

>I'm not saying it was a particularly great two years in film, but did you see the Big Short or Ex Machina?

Big Short I wasn't crazy about and I loved Ex Machina. I concede that that Mad Max is the best film of the past 2 years (so far, haven't seen any heavy hitters yet like Fences or La La Land) because it benefits from a particularly weak class.

Just because you were drawn in by the cheap ticks of the lazy plot, does not make this a good film. 

Casey Afflek being a moody, violent ass does not mean a powerful performance. 

Michelle Williams crying is not Oscar worthy acting. 

You are not special. Nor are they. All families have to deal with grief. As you get older, the more you have to face. Its just a fact of life. 

Adult characters acting like teenagers in the face of loss is not compelling or engaging.

Their grief should have been the background to a bigger story. It should have been the depth behind another plot. But no. 

People, yourself included, laud the 'truth' or realism of this situation, but 'truth' seems to mean 'uneventful'. It seems to mean ease. It seems to mean 2.5 hours of nothing happening. It just goes to show how sheltered and warped your view of reality actually is. It takes more than washed-out saturation, a swearing teenager and driving scenes to depict reality. 

Reality is a struggle. The characters in this film had none. The kid inherited an estate worth around $750,000 FFS. This is pure Hollywood trash. 
 
Viewed as an adult with real life experience, I will stand by my assertion; this was an overrated TV movie. It was almost insultingly bland, emotionally manipulative (to those that are susceptible - i.e. the target audience), and in no way a real depiction of a slice of life.

Small stories shouldn't take two and a half hours to tell. ",5hi9i5
db6gslu,"Thanks for the support. Can you please clarify what a bro-mag is? I didn't know working in tech was such a problem. What profession do I need to qualify as not emotionally stunted? I know what you mean. Alicia Vikander is a difficult woman to find attractive. A multi-lingual, intelligent, funny, Oscar winning, ex-ballerina with flawless looks is gross. Especially in her breakout role. ",5hi9i5
db6hobi,"You said it. It is banal. Banal isn't praiseworthy. Banal isn't compelling. 

Banal and solemn just makes over-earnest movie critics nod their head and applaud the grayness of it all. Banal dupes them into not asking any difficult questions of the movie. 

If you think banal, slow and solemn is what they were trying to achieve, then you've been sucked in by the Hollywood marketing machine.

This is an old-fashioned TV-movie tear-jerker. Nothing more. It's even badly edited and poorly scored. It's by the book emotionally manipulative. But because people aren't crying, shouting or being OTT melodramatic (though it has its moments), its lauded as a masterpiece study of subtlety. 

Subtlety and internal conflict have been done much better many times before. People dealing with their situation in an immature, dull way, with no outside struggle, is not interesting or entertaining to those that see past the bullshit veneer. 

This film does three things well: 

1) It dupes people (mainly women) into caring with emotionally manipulative themes. 

2) It successfully, but pretentiously elevates itself above TV-movie trash by removing all emotion, vibrancy or plot, and masquerades as a ""slow, solemn movie covering the banality of unfolding events and characters, wherein the conflict is mostly internal, subtle and unspoken"".

3) By being moody, dour and uneventful, it will achieve its ultimate goal - to be showered with Oscars. ",5hi9i5

However, it has been abundantly clear that the, mostly liberal, media was certain that Clinton would win. Liberals, instead of going into an actual discussion would dismiss most republican voters as stupid hillbilies. And then got surprised when Trump actually won. Had they been able to discuss, maybe, just maybe there would be a lot less namecalling and a lot more issue-solving.

The same happens on this sub. People who don't like the movie are ridiculed, their movie tastes are questioned.

When Patrick and Lee were passing the ball back and forth (after the funeral, walking together - that's when Lee was telling Patrick that Lee was going to rent an apartment with an extra bedroom for Patrick ""or all my extra shit""). The passed ball was just a small, tiny metaphor for a shared connection between the two. 

And in the last scene, fishing together - a callback to the earlier scene when Patrick as a young child is fishing with his dad and uncle on the same boat. Lee is asking Patrick who he'd rather be stranded on a desert island with, and Patrick says his dad. In the end, he (Patrick) gets stranded with Lee, and it worked out. That's what the final fishing shot, the two characters now both adults (or close to it - Patrick has to make adult decisions, that's the theme of the earlier conversation, he can stay with the other family or make a different decision, it's up to him) says to me: Patrick got stranded with the wrong adult, and it worked out OK.

I don't really think that the movie stereotyped Christians. Remember, as Lee Chandler himself said to Patrick, ""We are Christians, too, ya know,"" in that car ride from the mom's house. Take a look at your own comments, about how Hollywood and Social Justice Warriors are trying to ""have you believe"" something. That in itself is a stereotype. 

I don't really intend to get into a liberal vs conservative type of discussion with you, but I think that there's room for you to expand your views, just as you hope that movies expand their views, too.

I'm really glad that you've got an open-minded Baptist Pastor brother in law. This movie's point of view doesn't at all negate the existence of open-minded men and women of faith, at all. Looks like you're trying to pick a fight, and to see stereotypes where they really don't exist.",5hi9i5

The way she gets hysterical trying to justify her actions and him trying to bed his torrent of feelings was a fantastic dynamic. The emotion was raw, uncomfortable and unfiltered.

You're the one that is using anecdotal evidence to assume no kid is prepared to deal with loss whatsoever. I'm sure maturity, reassurance and support play a big role in helping children overcome grief. 

This film was more art than documentary and being so I can attach all the interpretation to any given scene I desire. Patrick was hardly a kid. He was a young man and seemed very well put together. He knew his father was in dire straights from frequent visits to the hospital so I can assume that, although still tough to deal with his loss, he was better able to mentally prepare and took it in stride much better than Lee's surprise tragedy. He may not be willingly distracting himself to stave off grief, but the truth is that he had a lot going on for him in the movie and he simply didn't have the time (that Lee has) to dwell on his loss. They're from two completely different perspectives/mindsets. Patrick is just starting his life so he's a lot more optimistic, Lee struggles letting go and fears starting over. Patrick may be dealing with his loss better out of pure naivete, but it still think that ball scene illustrated their respective thought processes well.",5hi9i5

I found the raw humanity of this movie in a subject that many people dont like to deal with very enthralling. Lonergan was interviewed on Fresh Air recently and he said this, “People don’t want to move on from their feelings of loss, my father passed away this year and you don’t want to leave them behind, you don’t want to get over it and feel great about it, you feel like you owe it to the people you’ve lost to carry that pain around with you in some form.” This statement was so profound for me.

He claims to be this guy who doesn't have emotions in the same way as the average person, at least since the fire, but he does have some, and you can see it just a few times in the movie like with his wife.

As for the burning pot scene. I think it does evoke an emotional reaction in Lee. My point was that the way that they go about showing the emotional reaction is indicative of th movie's style.  
In my opinion, and you may already have read this so I'll keep it shorter, the major strength of the movie is the way that it doesn't over dramatise.

For TWBB, the payoff is when Plainview's lust for power finally overcomes him, he snaps and goes apeshit on Eli. There's no falling action, no moment of reflection, just cause and effect. Selfish characters making selfish choices in their quest for control. As an audience we are conditioned to expect some semblance of redemption for these people, but it never comes. They are beyond redemption, sinner and saint alike. Greed wins. That's the payoff. 

As far as LLewyn Davis goes, I have no idea what you're talking about with this symbolism mumbo jumbo.

I love the movie because it is a funny fucking film whilst also making me want to weep. One moment I'm railing against the injustice of the world to not recognize his talent, and in the next I'll be grinning because even though I want Llewyn to succeed, in truth he deserves everything he gets.

The scene at the end between him and his wife shows how strongly, completely, that the grief has destroyed him, how he hasn't and will be unable to ""beat this"".

I'd say that I enjoy artsy and slow movies. I don't need a lot of action in a movie for it to be interesting. My favourite movie happens to be filmed in one room with virtually no action whatsoever (12 Angry Men).

However, in Manchester by the Sea I see no real character development, no progression. Sure the backstory behind Affleck's character is tragic and it explains why he has such a bleak role and *doesn't want to talk about it*. But to me there is no real drama in the movie, maybe except 2-3 scenes, which is unacceptable at this level. I cannot symphatise with any of the characters, even though I have lost my father a year ago and know what grief feels like. Certain scenes felt so akward and out-of-place that I kept waiting for that one moment which would eventually get the movie going (pardon the expression). It's just full of scenes that do nothing to progress the characters or the plot (virtually non-existent except for the flashbacks).

The whole movie through he does nothing but go through the motions of being alive. He doesn't do anything playful or that makes him human, the only thing he does which isn't a necessity is drink and get in fights. Then at the end of the film we see him do something that is playful, which is an immensely human moment. On top of that this is very clearly set out at the beginning of the film which repetitively shows him doing the same things - fixing pipes, putting away rubbish, and clearing snow. This is mirrored in the end of the film where he does something spontaneous which shows he has changed in a subtle way.

I had the same problem with Kate Blanchett's character in Blue Jasmine. I liked Blue Jasmine but it left me cold because there was zero change from beginning to end. In As Good As It Gets, Nicholson starts out a complete anti social curmudgeon and makes a journey to become some semblance of a normal person. Nothing even resembling this happened in Manchester.

deai7wc,"If you're saying that Patrick did a great job portraying someone who shows no emotion over a traumatic event, then I can't really argue with that. As a movie watcher I need to see emotions, and he showed nothing (other than the freezer scene which was quite good). It's not enough to just assume that he is internalizing everything and figure that's why he shows no emotion. I don't know if the film-makers were hoping to portray someone who doesn't externalize anything or if they didn't know how to convey those emotions on film. Either way it detracted from the movie for me because I couldn't read what he was going through. As an example, some people deal with physical pain much better than others and to see, for instance, someone who gets their arm chopped off just look at the wound and continue on like nothing happened would take me out of a movie as well.

Financially, his nephew was accounted for and his guardianship rights were passed along to George. He could have, by all accounts, resumed his position and living arrangements in Boston.

He progressed gradually. He was opposed to keeping the boat after speaking with the lawyer, and then capitulated to his nephew about investigating the motor problems with George's help. His next step was identifying his brother's rifles and eventually selling them to pay for a new motor, something his nephew wanted from the beginning. The scene directly after, he inquired about work where before, he was adamant about moving back to Boston as quickly as possible. I think it suggests that over time, interacting with his nephew made him consider laying down roots again. 

The lawyer discussed options vaguely with him when Lee read the will. He floated George as a possible guardian, and after months of slowly battling, George was eventually asked to take Patrick in.

I have to disagree completely. I thought the character development was good, and where you felt it may have stagnated, I felt it was a reflection of the immense grief people go through and the way it binds some of us to a life of simple existence.

Lee made seemingly minute changes, after repeatedly denying the need to make them, as time went on. They may have seemed small, but given the incredible losses he suffered, I believed that a man that broken would experience change, no matter how slight, at that pace. ",5hi9i5

No, he was saying: ""half way there i can't remember did i put a screen on fireplace, i figured it's okay, so i just kept going to the store ""

 i don't know why you were laughing, cause obviously he wasn't sure did he put screen on fireplace or not, also was visibly drunk. In such state most of people not gonna make smartest decisions. 

The movie does have comedy in it, but i don't think death of his children was one of those moments, it wasn't like ""oooppps i killed my family"" it was emotional   scene with dramatic camera shots and tragic beautiful music on background.  

>The story, to me, is about a man who cannot deal with anything slightly emotional and is placed in the most emotional situations possible.



He deals with his tragedy as many people would, with self-hatred, that's why he choosing most shittiest job and why he doesn't interested in ladies in a bar, and instead going there to be beaten, he wants to be punished for what he did, his shitty job, shitty room without furniture, his rejection of every woman or social connection is a self-punishment.  In the police station he was very surprised that he not gonna receive punishment, so right after  main hero tries to kill himself.   

Audience and half of the town are conflicted, and eager to blame him for such tragedy, and main hero accepts such outcome with open arms, not only he agrees that it is his fault he's also willing to take any opportunity to punish himself, he's not trying to find happiness or even have a ""good time"". Lee doesn't care about social connection, relationships, happiness, comfort as it shown by his choices of how he talks,the job he takes and willingness to live without furniture. Comfort not necessary if your goal is self punishment. At that point he doesn't care so much, that he doesn't even trying to kill himself, and basically are detached shell of a man he was, observer to his self-punishment.

 When he was talking to his ex-wife and she was saying she sorry for what she said and  loves him, he saying there is nothing inside him ,  that's the truth that he already dead inside as a result of a punishment.  His ex-wife says he ""can't just die"", but it's too late.  Right after a talk with his ex-wife, he goes  back to the bar and starts a fight in search of a punishment again, basically  confirming that his desire of self-punishment didn't go away, even after his wife apologized to him.

 At the end of the movie he realized that he can't be Patrick guardian and continue to punish himself, he's giving away his nephew to other people, he's gonna just leave the picture, he's not gonna change or leave a road of self punishment, he's not gonna be saved by suddenly reconnecting with his nephew and receiving an apology from his ex-wife.


At the end when he is back to being a plumber and was fixing stuff  old men was telling a story about his father who died: ""A young man who worked on a tuna boat, he get up one morning  there was some weather,  nothing dramatic and he never returned, no signals no maydays, no one ever find out what happened to him""

A story that is a basically a metaphor to our hero journey, he just left, without searching for help or  giving any signals that he needed one, even though he left not on some dramatic note, we're not gonna find out what happened to him,  there is some ""weather"" and we can only assume there is nothing good ahead of him, but we're not gonna find out his end.

Things just keep moving forward. He's a broken man, and very little is going to change that. Casey aflecks character smiling while on the boat after they got the new motor was a major moment(imo), and it felt so real.

He was getting wasted and getting into fights in Boston, it's not like his life was much different there. He and Patrick could help each other out.

Everyone really did pussyfoot around him the whole movie, which is one way to handle the problem. But yeah, like you said, sometimes a person needs a wake-up call/bucket of water in the face.

db19i5l,"But that's kind of the point, isn't it? It's not about whatever bullshit they teach in Screenwriting 101. The movie is a reflection of reality. In movies like Good Will Hunting, it all boils down to one big ""eureka"" moment of catharsis, where the protagonist confronts their demons and cries for a bit - and then, boom, the trauma is gone. When does that ever happen in real life? How can it possibly work like that? The kind of shit that the character of Lee Chandler has gone through in Manchester will haunt him for the rest of his life. He's never coming back from that.

Kenneth Lonergan, the movie's writer and director, has gone on record criticising Hollywood movies for their clear-cut depiction of personal growth in that way. How can spending a few weeks or months or even years with his nephew lead to Lee suddenly moving past what happened to him? If you genuinely think this movie would have a good ending if Lee suddenly goes, ""Being with you has taught me so much and now I am ready to face the world again!"", then I stand by my original statement: on a deep-seated, fundamental level, you simply do not understand this movie.

Sorry if you're not comfortable with the lack of miraculous recovery, sorry if it doesn't fit in with your film school cookie-cutter ideal of how movies should be made, but that's how trauma works in real life, so deal with it.",5hi9i5

Exactly -- when a character's given up and we can see that, it's hard to empathize.  In fact, it's frustrating.

> Also the damn organ music was too overused and drawn out during some of the more important scenes which really ruined it for me.

Definitely felt out of place, especially when the shot changed and the music just kept on going.  It was overpowering for several minutes during integral parts of the film and I just don't understand why they wouldn't have a bit more restraint.

Like when Casey Affleck first walks in and sees his brother in the morgue -- they didn't have any music, they didn't have Affleck break down or overact -- it was quiet, intimate, and not drawn out.  One of the strongest scenes in the film in my opinion.",5hi9i5
dc3xjd8,"> Financially, his nephew was accounted for and his guardianship rights were passed along to George.

George said he didn't want to be his guardian.  

I didn't think it mattered, though -- I wasn't hoping/fearing that he'd leave or stay -- I knew he'd end up staying and doing the right thing.  

If George had been more willing to take Patrick in, then that would've created more of a dilemma for Lee.  

> I think it suggests that over time, interacting with his nephew made him consider laying down roots again.

I mean yes, there was some growth, but my complaint was there wasn't enough -- that it was too little, too late.  Too little to be satisfying, and too little to justify the melodrama in the film.

Melodrama works well with strong and pronounced character arcs. 

> I have to disagree completely. I thought the character development was good, and where you felt it may have stagnated, I felt it was a reflection of the immense grief people go through and the way it binds some of us to a life of simple existence.

I mean it is a reflection of grief.  But with no real catharsis and everything just sort of happening to the characters without them reacting much, it felt like it meandered. 

And with the tonal inconsistencies, it was even harder to get invested.  I feel the film needed to be focused and polished.

I've presented plenty -- read through them and respond to what I have said before saying I haven't.

What other specifics do you need?  The movie dragged on and the nonlinear approach didn't help.  The film was in need of simplifying and streamlining.  

I didn't find it added much variety -- a lot of the flashbacks were equally relentlessly depressing as the scenes set in present day.  I mean the entirety of the house fire scene is in flashback -- and the overbearing music and slow motion makes it so melodramatic.

The fact that most of the flashbacks are exposition doesn't help, either.  It draws us away from the conflict and hurts the pacing.",5hi9i5

The characters in this movie are just... so beyond unintelligent and it was always funny to me. He's self-punishing himself because the police/fire whatever refused to.
