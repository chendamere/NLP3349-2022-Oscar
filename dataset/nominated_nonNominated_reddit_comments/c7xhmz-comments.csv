esn4flf,"In the beginning I thought Gyllenhaal was kind of bad; kind of like he was phoning it in and a bit cheesy. Then it turned out it was just Beck that wasn't great at acting. Gyllenhaal was fantastic. 

Also the illusion sequence was so cool. I loved when mysterios helmet was the moon. 

I didn't feel like it slowed down through the middle like a lot of MCU movies. It had great pacing. ""Did I tell you my wife pretended to blip out on me?"" Lmao

The humor was really good as well. The two teachers were great. 


And holy shit that after credits scene.",c7xhmz
esl5xzy,The final web swinging sequence gave me goosebumps! It felt so good seeing him swing around Manhattan finally. Hopefully the third movie is set directly there!,c7xhmz

esmvgn4,I swear that for one scene where peter takes a selfie with a camera. That the photo is taken straight from the Spider-Man PS4 game. Did it look like that to anyone else too?,c7xhmz
esk6j75,"That whole sequence when he fucked with Peter, and then you think it's finished and Fury shoots Mysterio, but then it's another trick and boooom train.

I laughed pretty good at the whole reveal sequence behind Quentens plan and they were all celebrating. ""To Janice!""

I thought the funniest part was Nick Fury kept getting disturbed when in Peters room after sleep darting Ned haha.

I found the whole theme of Nick Fury being shocked at the little respect he's getting throughout. Was funny as. Sam L Jackson still got it. What a legend.",c7xhmz

esk5bo3,Seeing the snap from a different perspective will never get old. Seeing the snapped people blip back into place was goddamn hilarious,c7xhmz
eskm4ba,Jake Gyllenhaal did such a good job with being a such a good friend (seemingly) to Peter that I was genuinely sad at his sudden but inevitable betrayal.,c7xhmz
esljkpb,"“Execute them all”, really Peter?  Gotta choose your words carefully.",c7xhmz
eslao4n,"I really enjoyed the moment in the end fight where Peter uses his spider-sense (Peter-tingle!) to catch Mysterio's arm before he could get shot.

Something about that was really powerful and raw. So much of Marvel is giant battles with fancy powers, or scrapping around and being punched through walls and cars and stuff. It looks great and obviously it fits the genre, but it lacks a certain authenticity when it comes to the threat you feel the characters are under.

But Mysterio *tried to execute Peter with a bullet through the back of his head*. That's incredibly intense. Much more intense than all of the preceding fight had been. 

Great directing from Marvel. Instant tone shift to hint at something really, really dark, without changing the overall pace of the narrative.",c7xhmz

esk48sg,That damn mid credits scene. Holy cow.,c7xhmz
esmi6xs,"I liked how the entirety of Mysterio and his team were a sendup of film production, with big special effects, random storylines that are just believable enough to make sense (""the monster is feeding directly from the Earth's core"") and a weird focus on pretty unimportant (""I need that cape ironed!"").  
Loved the scene where he was going through the effect frame by frame, and how his non CGI costume is basically a mocap suit.",c7xhmz
esmsst6,"The Nightmare Imagery scene is, for me, one of the best things ever in the MCU. I'm hoping more superhero movies are willing to use horror sequences after how successful these were in FFH and Aquaman.

J Jonah Jameson being in Far From Home put one of the biggest smiles of my face this year.

And I think this movie is legitimately funny in a way most major Blockbusters have been lacking recently 

Solid movie but those three aspects were my favorite part.",c7xhmz
esk4onv,"They really, really did right by Mysterio. He’s so cunning and devious and trustworthy when he wants to be - I loved it. His character was so well done",c7xhmz

You're welcome.",c7xhmz
esk4rbg,Watching the teacher spend a solid 30 seconds to drop that camera in the water was the most stressed I’ve ever been watching a movie.,c7xhmz
eskpmca,"I went through a fair amount of comments but haven't really seen anyone focus on how fucking funny MJ swinging with Peter at the end was.

Like, *of course* it would be terrifying and in no way romantic.

That first time Kirsten Dunst's MJ swung with Peter she was all lovey and calm and holding onto a mannequin while her hair blew in the wrong direction.",c7xhmz
esk5kbi,"I really enjoyed this film overall, there were a lot of nods and references scattered throughout. 

Like Peter looking like Tony to Happy and even the whole giving him the necklace to hold onto like how Tony did with the ring. 

Then we had the bridge scene with the shield and drone bomb being held like Mjolnir (Don't think I spelt that right).

But just all in all this was a really good continuation of Homecoming, I enjoy that he has progressed in fighting ability but still had a scene where he gets beat down. 

Side Note: I'm thinking with his identity out there now there will 100% be a Sinister Six movie. Also it worries me what his life is going to be like now that he looked at as a villain by the public, and everyone knows who he is.

Edit: Just remembered how they (at least for right now) said that the multiverse was just a story and not at fully introduced.",c7xhmz

Anybody who has played Arkham Asylum will feel right at home with the illusion scenes.

I love the tie in with the greater MCU.

I was really happy to see more focus on Peters Peter Tingle. I know a lot of people felt kinda bad about it from Homecoming because the movie just took it for granted.

EDIT: Also our boy JK as JJJ. Correct me if I am wrong but is this the first kept casting in the MCU?",c7xhmz

esmr7lt,"Villains are becoming incredibly likable in recent years. I knew Mysterio would somehow turn out bad because of the comics, but I was clinging on to the hope that he would somehow, magically be a good guy. He was so charismatic. Jake Gyllenhaal crushed this role.",c7xhmz

eskj62d,"At one point, we see the back of Nick Fury's car, whose license plate reads, ""ASM-28956."" In the previous Spider-Man movie, a license plate read something like ""ASM-43246"" which eluded to the debut of Vulture or Shocker in Amazing Spider-Man comics. The first three numbers signifying the issue number and the following two digits specifying the year of release. 

Does anyone know what ASM-28956 means? I looked for issue #289 but the book seems to revolve around the Hob Goblin.",c7xhmz

-“Do not invoke her name”

Makes sense that the dude is gonna he intimidated and almost reverent of his space god friend who singlehandedly ended the Kree Skrull War and saved the entire race of Skrulls.

esk7dr4,Anybody else feel the train yard scene when Mysterio puts Spidey in illusions is hand downs one of the coolest CBM scenes of all time ?,c7xhmz
esk4rqa,"I liked that this movie continued the running theme of the Iron Man movies that the villain was someone who was scorned by/felt scorned by Iron Man — Stane in Iron Man, Vanko in Iron Man 2, and Killian in Iron Man 3. Except now instead of facing Iron Man himself, he faced his successor.",c7xhmz
esminyh,"Holland was terrific as always, I also enjoyed Ned’s B plot.

esn0l4j,"Talos was talking about us and to us when he was talking to Nick Fury.

esmzwdq,"I think my jaw actually dropped when Mysterio revealed Spider Man is Peter Parker in that end credit scene.  I have to think that by far this was the most significant end credit scene ever in the MCU.  There's no putting that back in the bottle, so it will be interesting to see how this new reality for Peter Parker plays out.",c7xhmz
esn19jo,They fully realized the Mystetio character in a way I wasn’t sure they’d be able to do; Gyllenhaal killed it. The final confrontation in the walkway was incredible. And I popped so big for JK Simmons showing up as JJJ.,c7xhmz

eskcvbr,"“Aww man, I love Led Zeppelin!” was my favorite throwaway line.",c7xhmz
esmvu31,"Mysterio’s plan worked! The world now sees him as a superhero in the same stature as Iron Man. I don’t think he even died, because his plan would have no longevity. As soon as a “Real” threat comes he would not be able to fight it. Like he does with his own created elementals. Setting up Spider-Man and making himself into the next sacrificail superhero was his plan all along. He did that exactly. He’s not dead and he won.",c7xhmz
esk4c3u,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but there was no Stan Lee Cameo.",c7xhmz
esk63ua,"There were a couple of moments where the pacing felt off, like when they suddenly cut to Peter on the roof in Prague after Nick chews into him a bit. 

But man, when Mysterio does that Mysterio shit in Berlin the movie really felt amazing. That was the type of Mysterio moment I really wanted to see as a fan of the 90s animated series.

Also super happy to see J.K. back! I hope this means Disney won't be afraid to cast non-MCU Marvel actors in the future if they're suited for the role.",c7xhmz
esk6z7t,"Turning Jameson and ”The Daily Bugle"" into an Alex Jones/InfoWars shitshow was a wonderful surprise. And a great contemporary take on the character.

Oh yeah, the movie: 

They did a good job adapting Mysterio to the MCU. Using advanced technology to achieve his goals. But I really loved how they made it a *production*, how it was a team effort with lots of people playing their part to make him the star of the show. A nice nod to his comic origins of wanting to rise above the background and take center stage.",c7xhmz
esk7ixf,The first after credits scene was fucking awesome.  I love the way they tied so many things in this movie to tony stark and the scene on the plane with Spiderman was awesome and hit me in the feels.  I love what they did with Mysterio and how they made it work.  Overall Marvel keeps knocking it out of the park.  This may honestly be my favorite Spiderman movie.,c7xhmz

Also Betty and Ned were so cute.

esmm50e,"A couple of thoughts:

* >!With the blip they had a perfect opportunity to introduce Harry Osbourne as a new classmate of Peter's and I am disappointed they didn't do that.!<

* >!I thought the stuff at the beginning with people still adjusting to everyone coming back was great.!<

* >!I thought the sequence in Berlin where Mysterio was tricking Spider-Man was excellent and reminded me a lot of Scarecrow in the Arkham games.!<

* >!The moment during the climax when Peter is in his suit (Stark tech) holding a sign and jumping off of it (similar to Captain America's shield), wielding one of the drones (which, when used, had a similar effect to Mjolnir) was very fitting.!<

* >!I loved that they brought back J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and I am very intrigued by the direction they have decided to take him (basically Alex Jones).!<

* >!During the post-credits scene, I got excited that they were starting to set up Secret Invasion, and was then disappointed to learn that it was Fury taking a holiday. On reflection, I still think Marvel are planning on doing a long con with Secret Invasion to make the betrayal by the Skrulls worse, as this just adds to the trust Fury has with them. It also makes sense for a couple of character moments throughout the film.!<",c7xhmz

esmdxyh,That shot took all three of Mysterio's health bars.,c7xhmz

esncvlg,"Anyone notice some influences from the recent PS4  Spider-Man game? Likely the result of parallel thought since they were in development at similar times, but Spider-Man taking a selfie in the 'final swing' felt very Spider-Man PS4.

They used so many different angles and it was mostly easy to tell what was going on and it never lost it's pace.

I had a minor issue with the drone piece MJ had picked up that showed so much of the hologram. Shouldn't it have just showed a little bit since it was hundreds programmed to show a complete image? But that's like a tiny problem anyway.

Jake Gyllenhaal was such a good Mysterio and it kinda sucks we won't be able to see more the character.",c7xhmz

If Tony had EDITH the entire time in end game, why didn't he use it against Thanos?

How was Peter able to throw giant boulders into the fire monster and not hit any of the illusion machines?

Why isn't Peter concerned that he woke in jail with his costume off? The Dutch police would have a photo of him and his fingerprints on file now linking him to the night monkey and Spiderman.

Why weren't the kids suspicious at all that a ""friend of Spiderman"" came to save them specifically? Wouldn't that also tell them that Peter is Spiderman, especially after saying that Happy was in love with Spiderman's Aunt, and they all know Peter lives with his Aunt.

The return of J Jonah in an Infowars type media outlet, Mysterio's twist and the reveal, how they handled the ""blip"" stuff. It was all really well done and if it's any indicator Marvel still has plenty of good stuff planned for us. 

One of my big things about Endgame was how everyone in Peter's class would have to have been blipped for these movies to continue so I loved that it started right off with explaining that and how they just rolled with it. I loved how Martin Starr got so much screentime and his character motivation of not losing a kid again. 

And then there's Mysterio. Look, I'm not comic book reader, but I could feel that this was an awesome and surprising twist on his character. I love how the trailers misled us into thinking he was a wizard from the multiverse. I loved his reveal scene in the bar. Marvel flexing on us hard by bringing back bit parts from Iron Man 1 to get us full circle. Homecoming had a great villain reveal and I feel like this one knew it had to kill it with Mysterio and it did. Man did I fucking love that tripped out scene where he bamboozles spiderman into an ass kicking. 

I also loved how so much of this revolves around Tony's death and who will take his place and what he left behind etc. Gave it a ton of heart. Holland killed it as he does. I can't help but feel like this iteration of Peter Parker just feels so right. Zendaya is also a wildly talented young person and got some time to shine in this as more than the weird outcast friend. 

It's hard to criticize this movie because I spent so much of it totally content with its twists and humor. I guess I wish there was more JB Smoove because I love that guy. Felt like he took a sidecar to Starr. 

Overall, if you don't care for comic book shit this may be a fun watch or whatever, but if you're into Marvel this is a great way to follow up Endgame and a really exciting telling of what's to come. 8/10.",c7xhmz

At the end of Homecoming there were neutral acquaintances at best, let alone friends. And at the start of this movie, they both have a crush on the other.

I get that they don't want to spend too much time on romance in a long super hero movie, but at least give us passing comment to explain what led to these feelings. I get that Peter and MJ like each other, but I don't really understand why or when this happened.",c7xhmz

esk49fq,"I'm not entirely sure if anyone from Marvel or Sony will see this but I just wanted to say:

Thank you. Thank you SO much for not spoiling this movie with trailers that reveal too much. I actually had some doubts going into this because I wasn't really *sold* on any of the trailers that were released. They all felt kind of generic and almost bland to me. But man, I'll take a mediocre trailer that's a precursor to a fantastic, incredibly well-made movie full of suspense and surprise than a trailer that ruins everything months before the film actually premieres. 

This movie had so much heart and Tom Holland really *is* Spider-Man in my mind moving forward. I used to go back between him and Toby but now, it's 100% Holland's role. 

And Jon Watts! What a fantastic sequel to an already impressive Marvel debut. What he and the writers did with Mysterio was awesome as far as I'm concerned, and the movie as a whole just made me smile from start to finish. 

Also, I'm still freaking out about the Mysterio nightmare/illusion sequence. Just absolute perfection.",c7xhmz
eskzbzj,"For me the real highlight of this movie was Jake Gyllenhaal. I mean wow. What a performance. 

I always thought Mysterio was a villain but he had me sold that maybe I had mixed it up and he really was a good guy.

Then at the end in the mid credits scene. Holy shit. I think I heard audible gasps from everyone in my theatre and I felt myself shaking with anger. That was incredible acting and also a great twist!

Also shout out to this movie for not using the same old ""Villain is just misunderstood and deserves some empathy"" that I've seen so many times before. Mysterio was a dick when he was first revealed and he was a dick when he took his dying breath. And even after he died he comes to us from beyond the grave for the express purpose of continuing to be a dick.

Finally the illusion scene was simply incredible. Maybe one of my favorite scenes ever.",c7xhmz

esk6bgz,"So anyone think Mysterio pulled another trick at the end? I think so. 

Too good of a character to not come back for the Sinister Six. Assuming the flash drive the drone operator grabbed was just the video given to the Bugel but wouldn't surprise me if MCU has more plans with Mysterio. I hope so at least. 

If they really wanted to put him over as a master of illusions, lies, and trickery it would make sense he could also fake his death so he could go underground and think of a new plan since this one got exposed. 

MCU has done crazier things and when they do the Sinister Six they kind of have to use him and Vulture since they are the only Spidey villains that have gotten real development. Prowler, Scorpion, and Shocker were kind of introduced but we know nothing about them really. Chameleon could be Dimitri, the Shield Agent that drove the bus, but that is also a stretch.

If they have to introduce 5 villains plus Vulture instead of Vulture and Beck + 4 then half the movie would be spent developing them or they would get no character at all.

Current Sinister Six roster guess: Vulture (reluctantly), Mysterio, Green Goblin, Prowler (reluctantly), Scorpion, Shocker. 

Comedy worked for me including the cringey teen romance and drama. Call backs on the plane with Happy were well executed and made me smile. Action was disjointed at times but makes sense with Mysterio and the 2nd act and 3rd act fights were fantastic and really built up a sense of dread. Just like the Vulture car scene you couldn't tell what was coming next, then BOOM fake out or BOOM I'm a train bitch!

1. Edith. I'm not sure Tony would even create Edith in a post-Ultron world. Maybe the blip put him back on that kind of track. I guess I can accept that he'd have it, but it just seems like a stretch.
2.  Up until the hour of Tony's death, Peter Parker was dead. He wouldn't leave something like Edith to him. So, unless giving it to him was not Tony's will, this plot point makes little sense.
3. Even if Tony did will it to Peter, I can't picture
Tony laying that responsibility in the hands of a teenager with no backup plan on place. At the very least, he would have Pepper have access to the system and the ability to shut it down. The moment the drones were exposed in London, or better yet, when Happy was told by Peter what was happening, Happy should have called Pepper and just have her cancel the drone attack.

Again, I liked the movie, enjoyed the Mysterio plan and how he was connected to Stark, and think the Talos bit made sense for how Fury acted (also, how long was he Fury?

eu2dv9g,"I thought Mysterio visually, especially the entire scene in Berlin, was great. Even thought I always felt like I knew Mysterio was messing with Peter, what they did with it really packed a punch. It almost got to Dr Strange levels of impressive. That one moment where Fury shot Mysterio and faked his own death, up until the train scene? Probably the best sequence in the movie. But as a *character* I still felt he could have done more. Vulture edges out as better on pure character alone. But this movie was just fun to watch...

...that got ruined in the post-credits. Fury and Hill being shapeshifters all along felt like a jumping-the-shark moment. As well as Spider-Man being revealed to the world. It just doesn't get me excited for the next film and it feels like after all that stuff about Spider-Man, he really is just going to be Iron Man Jr.",c7xhmz
eubr4na,"I really liked the movie as I was watching it but the more I thought about it the less I enjoyed it, which is a big shame because ideally you want your movie to be even better on a rewatch.

The villain had a killer actor and visuals and was enough to get the ticket's worth, but halfway through the movie he quite literally pauses the movie in a 'scratch record, freeze frame' to flashback to explain his motivations at the audience in a frankly really immersion-breaking way. Worst moment of the movie by far.

And then you have a fair bit of slapstick humor, characters acting in stupid, frankly non-realistic ways that sort of make you feel like you're watch the cartoon version of spiderman. After watching Homecoming, I was expecting this movie to also really make me connect to most characters and feel like they're all very 'grounded', but unfortunately I was let down.

Overall, it's worth the single watch. The villain's performance is worth it alone, but if you're more into spiderman himself then you might not enjoy it much.",c7xhmz

Y’know I was part of the group who wanted Mysterio to be a good guy with multiverse actually being canon, but once Peter was talking about how he didn’t know who he was, that’s when I knew that this guy was bullshitting. Even his acting was very terrible.

But once Jake Gyllenhaal started acting like the real Mysterio, he was amazing. He was actually terrifying as a villain, the scene where Mysterio catches Peter in his trap was crazy.

When Happy started playing Back in Black as Peter did his workshop, I definitely fanboy’d from it. Happy has definitely turned into a good father figure for Peter, and it helps that he and May are seeing each other.

Those post-credit scenes were insane! Mysterio pulling one last dick punch by revealing Spiderman’s identity to people was equally as insane as Tony Stark revealing his identity as Ironman. That really must’ve been intentional. Also JK Simmons cameoing as J. Jonah Jameson was such a good moment!

The last end credit scene where Nick Fury and Maria were revealed to be ~~Kree~~ Skrulls was great. The part where Nick freaked out on Peter saying “Captain Marvel” made a lot more sense after that. And the real Nick Fury just taking a vacation on a ~~Kree~~ Skrulls spaceship was also great. I really wanna see what he has in plans in the future in space.",c7xhmz

With all seriousness though, good movie. I knew that there was some twist coming for Mysterio (I mean, it's freaking Mysterio), but damn if I almost wasn't convinced by Gylenhaal's charismatic performance.

We got to see a little aftermath of the snap, really wanted to see that. I still kinda want a mini-series focusing on the normal people after the snap, there's a lot of potential there. I properly died with the Comic Sans ""in memoriam"" btw.

Really fun action scenes too. And Beck's illusion on Berlin, damn. Highlight of the film for me. And that damn post-credits scene man, what in the actual fuck.

Really not a fan of Beck's huuuuuge exposition dump when revealing his whole plan though. Might as well look directly at the camera and give a stereotypical evil laugh while he twirls his mustache. Also couldn't shake the ""Isn't this just like Syndrome for The Incredibles?"" feeling.

Where did the Gondolier go for Ned and Betty I must have missed it, did he jump in the water?

Edit: where did mysterio get the cloaking tech? Different from the holograms. The wakandaians have it, but I doubt they shared that technology to the world. The writers for [Endgame](https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-iron-man-heimdall-brawl/) had originally during writing the script had at ne point consider sending Thor/Iron man to asgard to retrieve the reality stone. They said I Iron man would use a cloaking technology and Heimdall would detect him and there would be a fight between iron man and Heimdall. So the disgruntled stark employees could have stolen it from stark technologies but since they changed the final setting they never gave the invisibility for Iron Man. Or Mysterio could have invented it themselves.

Edit 2: 3rd rewatch I know for sure the British script writer Guterman did reappear again near the end of the film when Harrington was leading the students away from the London Bridge they run underneath an arch building I am pretty sure was the entrance to the Tower of London. The camera had him out of focus but you can see him casually leaning against it with his Irish flat cap watching the Midtown Highschool kids and teachers run past him as we see later when Mysterio asks for a line to say he is still standing there casually giving him suggestions.

Seeing that people blipped back right where they blipped away.  It got me thinking that A LOT  of people probably died when they came back if these people disappeared while driving or working they probably popped back super dangerous situations.  If they disappeared while flying or on ships or anything else, they were probably fucked.  That's crazy.

Marvel really had me going with that multiverse shit for mysterio.  But true to form that brought it back around to the real mysterio and they did it GREAT.  It didn't all click for me until Peter wanted to give him the glasses. Then I knew he was the bad guy. Also, wouldn't have using the glasses been the better idea to begin with when they went to the fire elemental?  ""Oh shit, the fire elemental! Edith! Send some drones to kill this thing!""   They used Mysterio should be used.  And his hologram mental games were outstanding.

You would have thought everyone in Peter's class should have figured out he was Spider-man at this point.  

That scene with the cops and the restaurant wasn't in the movie.  Hopefully it's in the deleted scenes.

The new Spider-Man movies are so down to earth, despite being part of the MCU, and I really appreciate that.

Granted, the movie is far from perfect (no pun intended) but I enjoyed the high points so much that I can't say I mind it much. The action and illusion scenes were absolutely breathtaking and are some of the most visually dazzling sequences out of any MCU entry. The awkward romance between Peter and MJ was really adorable and I was also thankful that it never turned into a love triangle with that other guy. And while I wished they gave him better material to work with, Jake Gyllenhaal killed it as Mysterio and is among my favorite MCU villains.

The twist at the end floored me and was one of the most memorable endings I'd seen in recent memory. It's already enough of a problem that everyone knows who Spider-Man is now but Mysterio manipulating the people into thinking the former was responsible for the chaos is fucking *insane*.

2. I fucking love MJ in this movie 
3. I know we all knew Mysterio was SUS as hell, but I loved the concept of the drone illusions etc. Made for some incredible visuals and a truly daunting challenge. The nightmare scenes were scary as hell!!!!
4. THAT SCENE WHERE PETER’S SPIDEY SENSE CAUGHT THE BULLET!!!!?!?? SO BADASS!!!
5. Uh oh, not sure what this movie means for our theories about the multiverse, since it was all BS 
6. I pretty much cried during the plane scene over the flowers. RIP Tony 
7. Just saw post credits scene. OMFG, wowwwwww. Funny as hell but not necessarily my headcanon that Fury wasn’t there the whole time. I guess it explains some of Fury’s out of character actions in the movie. I do like the Captain Marvel continuity, though.

It really felt more out there compared from Homecoming. Mysterio? Never trusted him from the start, never will.. but that reveal? Frickin amazing. He played us all like a damn fiddle.

I just realised it now but even though he's just an illusionist, this movie really emphasises how much a threat fishbowl head is to spiderman. That illusion ambush part was mindfucc after mindfucc.

The movie was considerably slow as  i thought the movie would be like 2  1/2 hours long. Thats just me though. The movie however was super funny. We needed something refreshing after Endgame.

Homecoming wasn't that, it was still the story about a kid, but this was peak Spidey. SPECIAL MENTION to the lack of jokes. I loved that. Despite what the comics do, I remember Spiderman as a serious hero of justice from the Raimi trilogy who was dead serious when fighting against the Green Goblin and Dr Octopus whenever someone's life was in actual danger. 

I would have hated it if Peter suddenly started cracking one-liners at Mysterio while the city gets bombed and his friends are being followed by killer drones. Even without all of that, this was Spiderman fighting someone he thought was a friend. It really wasn't the time for the usual MCU humor.

- WATCH THE POST CREDITS SCENE, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST ONE! IT’S SO GOOD WTF

- Everything you expect from this film, yeah, you’ll probably get it. Not the most surprising but it didn’t need to be.

- The sequel’s gonna be super interesting depending on which way they take it.

#SPOILERS

- I enjoyed myself throughout the movie and there are no glaring flaws I can really notice. Humor is solid, less so than last move in my opinion but maybe I’m more jaded.

- I never trusted Mysterio so his heel turn took me by no surprise. His backstory was fairly bog standard, same as Vulture and Mandarin. Cute seeing the “HE BUILT THIS IN A CAVE, WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS” line again. He was a fun villain though, just mustache twirly enough but with a fair point in that he wants the world to have some sort of hero again. Obviously the methods were bad, and maybe I’m just partial to Jake Gyllenhaal, but I enjoyed him being on screen.

- Favorite part of the film by far was the first Mysterio vs. Spider-Man fight scene. Just a masterclass use of CGI, those effects were bugging me out, like holy shit.

- Nick Fury having some good Nick Fury lines. I called him being a Skrull halfway through the movie cuz he was being super aggressive and crotchety throughout the film, the post credit’s scene was sooooo validating.

- Tom Holland is a good actor. Zendaya is a good actress. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor. This movie was acted well.

- The relationships in this movie were well handled for teen romance. Just awkward enough, I could feel myself cringing sometimes at how overly mushy Ned and Betty were and how insecure and just awkward MJ and Peter were. People might complain about MJ lying to Peter I feel, but she explains it herself, she’s insecure and not good at attaching herself to people. It was cute and I wanna see where they take it from here. Speaking of...

- HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK EVERYONE KNOWS SPIDER-MAN’S IDENTITY AND NOW HE’S LIKE HATED BY THE PUBLIC OR SOMETHING? SILVER SABLE IN THE THIRD MOVIE MAYBE? I REALLY NEED TO KNOW HOW THEY DO THIS LIKE WTF?

TL;DR: Good movie, wanna rewatch it so I think it’s a better movie. Slightly let down but I had waaaay too high expectations, and it sets up for a killer 3rd film. Hopefully that one is better than Homecoming, which is a high ass standard. 7/10",c7xhmz

It was also interesting that the movie shows us that Beck and his team essentially had three ways of portraying Mysterio, depending on the needs of the ""scene"": first, the fully holographic projection, used for the flight sequences, and the larger, more drastic effects  (because Beck couldn't actually fly); second, his mo-cap suit, with the Mysterio costume projected on top of him (probably used for scenes where he needed to interact with Spidey, but, for example, needed to still use his powers, and use his helmet; and third, where it was Beck in the full, ""practical"" Mysterio costume (the one that the lady was ironing, so he could ""shake hands with the queen"").

Now that Peter's identity has been revealed, I wonder if the thugs and criminals in prison (post credit scene from Homecoming) will send people to attack Peter or how it'll pan out in the future. 


All in all, what a fantastic film. I'm not an avid MCU watcher as of lately so as a casual watcher I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Really loved MJ and Peter's little flying scene towards the end not to mention the awkward first kiss. I was actually fangirling. The awkwardness and chemistry between the two is very well balanced and I can't wait to see where it'll progress. The humour was great too. Ahhh there's so many things I loved about this film.

Gyllenhaal killed it, super entertaining villain. I'm not entirely convinced he's dead, obviously Mysterio still exists cause Ralphie took the holo data.

I LOVE Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Going into Homecoming I wasn't too high on it and didn't want to see it, but it ended up being one of my favorites, this had high expectations and passed them for me. Holland's a fantastic actor, love it.

I'm entirely convinced that either Flash or his dad is gonna be Green Goblin, or a villain of some kind. They laid some serious groundwork with him in this movie. And with Brad as well, got a lot of screen time to just be a romantic rival. Potential big bad later?",c7xhmz

I also love how Beck was a complete dick right until the end credits. We get this touching moment between him and Pete where he talks about how he regrets what happened between them and then he goes and reveals his identity to the whole world.

etgu8ia,"Loved the movie but can't shake the feeling that it felt like there was some deleted scene involving Brad at the end or a rewrite or something?  This occurred to me since Brad starts complaining to the rest of the class in London that Peter behaves weirdly and nobody else acknowledges it. Then when everyone returns off the plane at the end we don't see Brad at all (or at least not a close up or a specific moment like Flash realising his mum didn't come to meet him). Peter says something to MJ about being sure people have figured out that he's spider man, but then she says some flippant thing like ""nah, nobody takes notice of you except me"". I was certain that would mean we'd get a close up of Brad overhearing them, or making it clear that he is suspicious, but when it didn't I figured it must be included in an end credits scene, setting Brad up to be a bigger villain or foil in a different film. Then at the post-credit scene with JK Simmons I figured that the tip-off that the Daily Bugle received about Spider Man trying to kill everyone, or that his identity was peter parker was going to come from Brad and not Mysterio, therefore connecting those other strange loose threads.

etx6on1,"Overall, it was an enjoyable first watch. It's not my favorite Marvel or Spider-Man movie, but there were certainly good elements to it. Here're a few of my personal notes:

* I enjoy what they were going for with Mysterio, but I felt that the final result was lacking. He's a villain based on deception, so having him actually be a team of disgruntled special effects/tech experts was a great idea. I just wish the rest of the team had more of an active role in the deception instead of everything being controlled by Beck. In fact, I wish that they were the ones who were interfering with Peter's trip instead of S.H.I.E.L.D., giving him more and more opportunities to assist ""Mysterio"" in fighting the Elementals and fostering that bond between them.
* To add to that, it would have been nice to see Peter have to make more choices between assisting Mysterio or committing to his field trip. In Homecoming, he stumbled from scene to scene with little agency over his life until those final moments. Up until that point, the major choices in his life were dictated by Tony and others. Now, I love Sammy J, but I think Peter's arc and this movie as a whole would have been much stronger if they took out the S.H.I.E.L.D. element all together. This would make Peter's choice to abandon the field trip have much more impact and Mysterio's deception much more devastating.
* I really enjoyed the first confrontation with Mysterio. The illusions were creatively engaging, and the scenes transferred seamlessly from one to the other. It really was a joy to watch, but I couldn't help but lose my sense of immersion when they were trying to tell me that all of these things were projected images. Initially, I thought Mysterio had hacked Spider-Man's suit using the E.D.I.T.H. system to create such a complex series of illusions, which I could accept. Peter would have to rely more on his \*Peter Tingle\* in opposition to the suit, and it would build off of the theme of ""If you're nothing without the suit, you don't deserve the suit"" that was developed in Homecoming. But everything just being projections and drones seemed a little much, even by comic book standards. I would have even accepted if they went back to Mysterio's roots as a special effects expert with more practical smoke-and-mirrors type effects, or at least some reference to the Uncanny Valley.
* I think one of the themes that they were going for was developing your own intuition. What kick-started Beck's rise to power was Peter's poor intuition of him being a man deserving of the E.D.I.T.H. system, brought on by his lack of self confidence. And in the final conflict, Peter's good intuition is what allowed him to overcome Mysterio's illusions and capture him. I wish this theme was explored more, though. It would have been nice to see Peter exercise his intelligence and investigation skills, working with Ned and MJ to uncover the inconsistencies with Mysterio. Instead of showing us the ""big reveal"" in the bar, or the scene where we see how they construct the illusions, I think it would have been much more compelling for our heroes to revisit some of the scenes to discover a broken projector or other small clues to help them slowly piece together what actually happened.

It may seem like I really disliked the movie, but honestly I think it's still worth a watch. The actors are charming, the story entertaining, the humor solid for the most part. I have a few nitpicks, but they're outweighed by the good elements, I'd say.",c7xhmz

Jon Favreau gave his best performance as Happy too. The scene where he remembers Tony when looking at Peter while he was making the suit was just beautiful.

Mysterio was awesome. Jake Gyllenhaal was terrific in the role. The illusion scenes were absolutely incredible. I really do hope they bring him back again.

The action scenes are among the top 5 best in the MCU. And the swing at the end was such a joy to watch. I hope they include those more in the future. Michael Giacchino's soundtrack was epic.

You know Mysterio is gonna be the baddie from comics but it was so well executed. He was written so cleverly in comparison to many other villains; his plan actually makes sense.

The movie has consequences, and it's conflict is incredibly well set up, Spider-Man in this movie you really feel the conflict between Peter Parker and Spider-Man here and when his Spider-Man life crosses into his Peter Parker life you feel the results they are disastrous he almost got someone killed and he faces the consequences for that.

In this film you really see Peter Parker's intelligence much more on display here than either of the Raimi films.

No one is a damsel in distress they are in danger yes but they stay strong as character and MJ takes agency for herself.

ewjjthw,"I was nervous going into FFH. How would an MCU movie function without Tony Stark and Captain America? Would it revert back to the early days where the character movies felt strangely empty, like the larger superhero world was missing? The answer is I was worrying too much.

The Good:

Tom Holland remains excellent. By far the best Peter Parker, he mixes clueless teenager with serious crime fighter with seeming ease. FFH is a movie about growing up and Holland performs that progression perfectly.

The writing is where this movie shines. Can Peter Parker become the Tony Stark character that the world needs (and in an oddly meta way, that the MCU needs)? The constant imagery of Stark and the Iron Man set that tone well. And it combines so well with a familiar Peter Parker theme, responsibility. Peter is both literally and figuratively running away from his problems by going on a school trip. They seem too big for him and beyond his power to combat. At the same time, Mysterio, and the many disaffected scientists of Stark Industries (how cool would it be if these people became AIM?) are trying to steal Stark's legacy. But their power is illusory. Having Peter see through that power in order to take on Stark's legacy is just great writing.

Mysterio/Beck was mostly great. He's legitimately threatening but also full shit. When Jake Gyllenhaal wants to act like a crazy person he nails it. And the change from appearing sane to crazy was actually menacing. I really liked that he wasn't a lone guy either. He has an entire support team of people making his illusions work. In a meta way (there's a lot of meta stuff in this movie), he's like a movie producer, talking about an ""Avenger level threat.""

The scenes where Peter is trapped in Mysterio's illusions were awesome. A good excuse to pig out on CGI 'cause how else are you going to do it?

Zendaya is a fine MJ. I didn't think the whole 'goth, but not goth' thing would work at first. But there's a heavy dose of 'doesn't take anyone's shit' in there too. 

I like that they make Flash a total dick without tipping him over into caricature.

The after credits scene were some of the best of the MCU. One brought back JK Simmons as JJ himself, but this time as thinly veiled Alex Jones. The other explained why Fury was acting weirdly aggressive the whole movie.

The Bad:

Why was Beck doing what he was doing? I get he hated Stark, he wanted to steal EDITH, and make himself look like a superhero. But to what end? Money? Fame? Does he want to make other heroes look bad? Wish there was a little more meat there.

The elementals were fakes, so why didn't anyone notice that nothing was burned or melted by the fire elemental?

I both liked and disliked Ned this time around. His relationship with that girl was funny and somehow grating at the same time.

I really like that Happy brought up how Stark was a mess, but I kinda wish he got into how often Stark screwed up. From poisoning himself, to Ultron, to essentially getting Peter killed, Stark often created the problems he had to fix. It would've been nice if a similarity was drawn with Peter's mistake with Beck.

I'm not sure where I'll put FFH in the MCU's top ten, but it's in the top ten. It's well written, visually fun, and filled with fun characters.

Loved the opening with the school report giving us a glimpse of what both snaps were like for regular people. Wild. 

Really dug all the Tony memorials throughout. I wish Cap got more love since apparently everyone thinks he’s dead too. 

Almost teared up when Happy was watching Peter work on his suit bc we were all thinking what Happy was thinking; reminded him of Tony. And then him picking the music was perfect.

I also hope that the whole peter not having  a secret identity plays similar to the way it was in the spectacular spider man when venom revealed his identity.

esqt569,"Saw it a few hours ago. I’m more of a fan of lighthearted/humorous super hero movies, so while many will say infinity war/end game is their favorite, FFH is by far my favorite super hero movie in general. Deadpool and Shazam are a close second but what helped put FFH over the top was Mysterio. Hot damn now THATS how you do a villain. While villains like thanos were cool, I never really felt threatened or feared for our heroes with thanos because no matter what I always felt thanos would get taken out. 

Mysterio was a good developed character, played brilliantly by his actor, and did felt like a real threat. He was no nonsense by just straight up killing his targets and the scene where he nearly shot Spidey in the back of the head felt so real. Plus that end bit with him totally ousting Peter was amazing. Got a big “NOOO” from me and the rest of my theater. So the question now is, is Mysterio really dead...?

In his debut movie he grows comfortable with the role of the ""neighborhood"" spider-man, and in this one he's allowed to properly react to Tony's death and prepare to take on the role as a part of the avengers. The most unrealistic aspect about the previous peter parkers was that the writers were so focused on the action and glory part of spider man, that they forget that peter is a literal child.

Now I'm actually confused about something.

Maybe?). Even Happy says he grew it in the Blip, but he could mean he grew it *during* the Blip (as in during those five years) or while *in* the Blip (as in being one of the dusted). 

Either me or that source, which I am not yet considering the truth, are misunderstanding. Could some one more knowledgeable clear this up?

\- Loved that they showed us the snap being reversed, basically seemed like people teleporting into place

\- lol at that wife pretending she got snapped so she could escape

\- Really liked how Mysterio and his squad were tied into this universe by basically being ex-employees of stark  

\- Loved all the illusion scenes, so trippy and random... reminded me of Doctor Strange  

\- Not sure if this is Marvel telling us spidey is the next Iron man but I loved the callbacks to the first Iron man (Identity reveal, AC/DC)  

\- oh hey look it's that blonde girl from that Black mirror episode! she did great in this movie showing what a typical high school romance looks like  

\- His suit looked a bit weird when he was doing that speech, it's supposed to be his CGI suit from avengers but they prob wanted to save some money and made the suit practical but it just ended up looking like a cheap version of it, kinda like cap's suit in his TV commercials vs his real suit  

\- One thing that I didn't like right at the end is the fact that NO ONE who actually wanted to protect their identity would grab their significant other and start swinging throughout the city then landing on the sidewalk with dozens of pedestrians around, it literally takes one person to photograph them and then someone at school being like *""wait, didnt MJ just start dating Peter? now that I look at it, Peter's voice and body shape are kinda just like spider-man's....""* but oh well, it's not like he has to worry about that now",c7xhmz
esn81tn,"There was an Easter egg at the very end of the film, but before the credits, that I'm very very intrigued by. 

The whole time Spider-Man is swinging in the vicinity of the old Avengers tower. This is confirmed by the appearance of the Battle of New York monument atop Grand Central Station. When he finally lands to pick up MJ, you've been able to see that the building doesn't resemble Avengers tower anymore at all. The Easter egg is in plain view at this point.

On the fencing in the background behind Spider-man there was a banner. It had a series of arrows pointing to the numbers 1-3 in sequence; it visually resembled a Subway map with the numbers being stations. The arrow leading to #4 instead led to a question mark. The text on the banner read ""we're excited to show you what's next"" or something to that extent. 

It cannot be a coincidence that this was at the base of the old Avengers tower (or at least in the area, it's not completely clear what building is behind Spider-man when he lands). It's a clear reference to the three phases of the MCU thus far and the mystery of where the MCU goes next. Either it's a cute nod to fans that the MCU still has great stories to tell, or there is a literal connection to the tower and the ""exciting things to come next"".

IMO, this could be the strongest case for Norman Osbourne to assume a huge role in the MCU going forward. They hinted at the tower being bought in Homecoming. Now the building has its huge facelift and there is this leading message. Is it now Oscorp? Based off the mid credits scene, Scorpion now has his target. Vulture could still be in play too. How was Mysterio able to doctor that video if he was dead? Maybe he's still out there too. 

I'm stretching a very subtle and easy to miss Easter Egg into a wild theory. But I'm hoping we have real evidence of a Sinister Six movie in the works. Or at a minimum, Norman Osborne's pending introduction to the MCU.

TL;DR: Avengers tower is definitely Oscorp now. Sinister Six on the way.",c7xhmz

Seeing the Marvel title card quickly got me down, realising we're going back into a world with no Tony Stark et al so seeing the cheesy GettyImages slideshow was the perfect tonic to that. But damn, what a villain they created in Mysterio. Props to Gyllenhaal for absolutely nailing it. Even though it seemed obvious he'd be the antagonist, still felt so blindsided when the reveal happened. Felt like a vintage Black Mirror episode when they pull the rug from under you with the twists at the end, and I feel that's the best compliment I can give for it. Could just feel the stakes getting higher and higher with that fucking illusion scene which was one of the best scenes I've seen. Just feeling so drained at watching Spiderman getting one upped by illusion after illusion after illusion was quite something by looking at his grave with mangled Iron Man coming out of it...blimey. Loved him diving into the illusion with it all culminating in the final battle. Could feel the anguish with the whole ""I trusted you, how could you?"" and then realising the final illusion before giving Mysterio his death blow. Goosebumps from even thinking about it, wish they kept Mysterio alive but I guess there isn't much for him to do, especially after ""that scene"" which we'll get to.


Loved all the subtle touches to our favourite heroes. Spiderman with a ""shield and hammer"", ""how does Cap do it?"" and then Spiderman making the suit with AC/DC and Hogan looking on happily. Beautiful.


Post credit scenes had me floored. What an unbelievable moment that was to see JK Simmons back. Probably the first time I quite literally screamed in a cinema. Love how they've got him involved for the whole ""Peter Parker gone rogue"". Gave Mysterio an unreal send off with that too. Best post credit scene that the MCU have dropped on us hands down. Second one was OK, tied up a lot of thoughts I had during the film nicely.


Side characters were all great. Could see Zendaya slowly make Mary Jane her own with this film, intrigued to see how the relationship between her and Spiderman develop.


Terrific job, great way to end Phase 3, can't wait to see what Phase 4 will bring.",c7xhmz

est2bri,"- God this movie was fun. Nice cleanser after the Infinity Duology. 
- I knew from the comics that Beck was going to be a gigantic fraud, and yet they still made the reveal extremely satisfying. Having him be part of a crew of disgruntled ex-Stark employees was a nice twist as well, and it provided us an opportunity to see Peter ""Christmas Story"" Billingsley again. 
- I liked MJ a lot better this movie than last. She actually did stuff instead of sit in the back making snide comments now and then.
- Ned and Betty were hilarious too.
- They basically copied the Scarecrow levels of the Arkham video games for Mysterio's illusions but I'm not complaining.
- J. JONAH JAMESON IS BACK, AND THIS TIME HE'S ALEX JONES. SPIDER-MAN IS A MENACE! A THREAT! And he's Parker, so I can't even ask him for pictures!
- So, I have a feeling we might be seeing Spider-Man: Homeward Bound (or whatever) sooner than we are expecting. Having May learn his identity and then glancing over it off-screen is one thing, but having everyone learn his identity feels like something they need to pick up on immediately. Would also be a good way of using a movie without moving forward the amount of time between now and the ""present"" so eventually the real world can catch up.
- Congratulations to Nick Fury on getting some much-needed vacation in Tahiti. It's a magical place. Also, shoutout to how the Skrulls being fill-ins can explain how Fury and Hill are a bit off during the movie. I wonder if Fury being in space is hinting at something (perhaps the next Captain Marvel film?) or is just meant for the gag. Probably a bit of both.

I get that Tony screwed everyone over, but how is everyone a complete psychopath? They hinted at some of them not being ok with what Quentin was doing when he turned the guns on them, but they didn't elaborate on that at all.

I did like the reveal though. It really goes to show how flawed Tony was.

It is sad that there's no confirmed multiverse though. I'm sure they'll do it eventually though.

The mid credits scene was fucking amazing. I think the framing attempt on Spidey should get cleared up relatively easily. The video was quite clearly edited. Like in universe it's obvious that it's edited. And due to the fact that the attack did not happen even though Quentin said it will as well as Spidey's reputation.

But Peter's identity being revealed is something that obviously cannot get cleared and man I'm excited to see what they'll do. This moment truly shocked me.

And of course I freaked the fuck out at JK Simmons returning as J Jonah Jameson. But I actually think his performance was a little disappointing. He was focusing way too much on trying to parody and impersonate Alex Jones instead of bringing back his character from the Raimi movies.

esknnff,"The movie was very entertaining to watch, I loved the use of illusions and the Peter/MJ scenes. But... I hope I don’t get downvoted, but I think I’ve found my problem with these Spider-Man movies (I also didn’t particularly enjoy homecoming) it’s *too* connected to the MCU. This doesn’t feel like Spider-Man to me, it feels more like “the adventures of Tony Stark’s sidekick.” I was hoping they’d expand Spider-Man’s lore in this universe a bit, introduce Oscorp, introduce a villain that DOES NOT have some connection to Tony Stark please, show more about who this spidey is and his moral compass that’s not connected to Tony Stark. I enjoy Tom Holland a lot, and I hope that mid credits scene reveal leads to more interesting directions for his character. Overall I enjoyed the movie a lot though, it was nice seeing action in places outside the US.",c7xhmz
esk4e37,"That movie was goddamn amazing. One of my biggest issues with homecoming was the lack of consequence in Peter’s life, but in Far From Home, Peter keeps finding consequence after consequence for his actions. Funny that this movie, Tom Holland’s Spider-Man 2 has peter get shit on and the shit kicked out of him just like Tobey’s Spider-Man 2. 

Mysterio exceeded every expectation I could have had, the use of drones/the holotech from Civil War was next level. Jake did a fantastic job in the role.

This movie subverted my expectations in the best of ways, all the twists had me grinning like a maniac. 

I could go on and on about all the amazing gags/callbacks, but one that I really found funny was when Peter picked up a sign and drone part and channeled cap wielding Mjolnir, just amazing.

esncamo,"Really enjoyed this one. I think it edges out Homecoming for me...but I'd probably need to rewatch to be sure. Obviously saw the Mysterio twist coming but thought it was pretty well done! Plus the humor was great...I laughed way too hard at Night Monkey.

Three minor gripes though. First, Pete handing Beck the keys to a enormous weapons system after knowing him for days at most felt kind of ridiculous to me. 

Second, the Mysterio 'reveal' scene was fun and hammy, but the exposition and backstory was laid on so thick. Who is Beck describing all of his goals and motivations for, if not only the audience? Everyone in the room with him knows this info already.

Finally, this is a nitpick...but why didn't EDITH require voice confirmation from Beck to get handed back to Peter (like Peter had to do to transfer it earlier on). Was Peter just sort of an admin user in the system?

All in all though, a very good MCU entry. Plus...those illusion sequences were fantastic. I also really do love how these Spidey movies do seem to draw on the shared universe even more than most other stand-alone MCU films do. They take great advantage of Spider-Man finally being in the MCU",c7xhmz

My mom used to watch this movie called “Only You” A LOT when I was a kid. When I first watched Homecoming, I saw Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), and I recognized her from that movie. In the plot of Only You, RDJ and Marisa Tomei have a romance in Italy. There’s this one scene where she’s with her SIL in a car and there’s a shot taken from above on a winding road. Idk why, but that stuck with me.

In Far From Home, when they’re riding on a bus from Venice to Prague, I’m pretty sure they had the same winding road shot from above. I recognized it immediately, and right after that shot, Peter looked up romantic destinations on his phone.

Once he let go of the pressure of becoming the next Iron Man, watching him craft his own suit & use Tony's technology was amazing to watch. He was finally stepping into his power. The look Happy gave him was awesome too.

You might say that this was almost as if he was becoming the ""next Iron Man"", but to me it felt like he was evolving into what Tony wanted him to become all along - not the next Iron Man/Tony Stark, but instead the next evolution of Peter Parker/Spider Man.

esn6c0z,"Overall, very enjoyable film. It was somewhat tough to get through some of the early, awkward teenage scenes, but Watts held it together. The third act is a great. They brought in a feeling of Mysterio from the 90s animated show, albeit really with the illusions done to spidey. Those scenes were superb. And, the constant movement on the bridge, with all the webbing, and necessary coordination, turned out really well.

Zendaya shines. This gets me amped to binge the shit out of Euphoria. She's top notch. 

JB SMOOOVE. Not much. but still just enjoy him in anything. 

Both credits scenes were phenomenal. Setting up more to come and begging questions about the MCU history.

espue4i,"Just came home, just some quick thoughts. It was objectively a good movie(if one can talk of such a thing), love that they kept going with the  comedy Superbad-esq wibe, though this time around it was more reminiscent of  Eurotrip(2004), which I loved. I liked the film, the characters and the villain was cool enough. 

Hoooowever, there was something I couldn’t quite put my finger on, but then I skimmed the comments here and I saw someone mention something about “Marvel fatigue” and I guess this time around it finally got to me.  Now, it’s not fair to judge a movie just because you’re tired of superheroes or whatever, but these movies are so connected I think it’s understandable that people feel this way and kind of intertwine the movies together when they view em. Like the blip for instance, cool that they bring it up and somewhat show the consequences, but when they joked around with it for like the fourth time I was like “okay we GET it thank you”. 
I had the same feeling with some of the Tony Stark, “burden on my shoulder” scenes, but it’s weird because it’s all handled so well. Parker is so easily fooled because Mysterio reminds him of Stark, the “passing  on the mantle” scene with Led Zepplin is fun, great even,  and touching. Iron Man street art appearing everywhere in the background “I see his face everywhere I go”. It’s good, very good. It just…feels like we’ve been here before somehow, it feels too familiar, too Marvel. 

I find myself preferring the scenes where the movie is just some awkward school trip, and less so with the spectacular CGI monsters. Like up until the scene in Vienna It was a perfect spider – man movie. Awkward teenage love, spider-man having to fight a monster for a bit and then return to the class, loved that. But then we go ahead  with nick furry and spy stuff(which was less successful/flushed out in my opinion, the spy element) and Iron Man, end of the world and all this big wishy washy. It’s okay to make a grandiose spider-man movie, he doesn’t need to be in Queens fighting muggers all his life, but it just feels a tad too flashy and honestly a bit “soulless”/shallow this time around. Finally Tom Holland, love you man, but also here we’re getting close too some sort of breaking point. It's weird to say but he almost (but he didn’t, not for me least) came close to tripping that line over from charismatic and loveable too a bit annoying. Maybe it comes down to character development, I hope the next time around he has a bit more of a spine and the entire movie isn’t based on one of his fuck ups. 

Idk,  kinda seems like I just wasn’t properly wired in tonight, like some other time I would've loved the film and not given it a second thought. I have some other, extremely nitpicky stuff, like how I always prefer spider-man to fight humanoids type enemies over monsters, just simple due to the choreography of the fights, but that’s just for me. Also some people that Iron Man screwed over, yet again, are the villians? Didn't dig the whole reveal scene and monologue. 

Good movie, probably a solid 7/10 or even 8. For me it all comes down to: More high school trip stuff, could have had more spy stuff even (would be interesting to see peter awkwardly stumble his way through a 007 cocktail paty) and less MARVEL and scrolls and Iron Man and whatever else connecting all the movies together.

In thinking of the next villain, I think Kraven is the only classic villain that hasn't seen any blockbuster screen time. We've had Green Goblin, Hob Goblin, Doc Oc, Venom, Sandman, Rhino (lol), Lizard, Electro, Shocker (lol), Vulture, Mysterio, and a brief look at Scorpion in Homecoming.

To me, he’s the definitive cinematic version of the character. So much of the “high school romance/drama” scenes worked so well, even more so than in “Homecoming.”

Loved Jake Gyllenhaal’s transformation from “very serious ‘Quentin Beck’ who lost his family in an alternative universe” to an obsessed, embittered ex-Stark employee. He vamped up the character in just the right amount and ended up being pretty damn sinister. The whole “zombie Iron Man” thing he pulled on Peter was *such* a dick move.

I haven’t read the comics, so I’m definitely curious about how “Phase 4” of the MCU will play out. Has Peter Parker’s identity as Spider-Man ever become public knowledge in the comics? What’s up with having the Skrulls play-act as Nick Fury and Maria Hill? Who’s the upcoming Spidey villain, or who will the “new Avengers” fight against next?",c7xhmz

f2s1vo0,"Watched it last night. Thought it was a fun movie. My only question is that Quentin said he was from another dimension's Earth and yet he actually worked with Tony Stark. So I suppose he was lying about being from another dimension. But we know that the multiverse exists. The Dr Strange sequel will delve into it. However I've forgotten whether it's been officially acknowledged already in the MCU movies (before Far From Home.)

et09gt2,"As a huge Spider-man fan, I found myself quite bored for a good hunk of the film. Not saying it was bad by any means, but I felt pretty disconnected from it, especially the first quarter to half.

I think a lot of that had to do with Mysterio's story going pretty much as expected - pretends to be the good guy, but was bad guy. The tweaks they did with his origins with how he was connected to Stark was a nice touch. Jake Gyllenhaal was great in the part.

Great job with Parker's conflict trying to balance being a teen and Spidey. 

There's nothing more to say about the VR illusions that hasn't been said already.

I'm really tired of seeing such a tech-heavy Spider-man. Especially at such an early part of his career as the Web-slinger. 

The patented MCU humour was getting a bit much throughout the film. I couldn't stand the teachers. As soon as May said ""Peter Tingle"" I thought ""great, so now this will be a thing for the rest of the film.""; And it was.

The MCU Flash Thompson is beyond obnoxious. I get that's the point.

I really can't stand this ""MJ"". Her character using the name aside, I simply find her dialogue grating. I've known kids like that when I was in high school, as well as working with teens for so long, and the ""I'm obsessed with telling the truth even if it hurts people"" and liking things such as murders, is almost to the point of trying to be edgy for the sake of being different. I didn't like her in *Homecoming* either. 

I REALLY hope we get Spidey back in NYC soon. Watching him sling through the streets of the city near the end of this film and having just re-watched Spider-verse this week made me realize that I miss having a Neighborhood Spider-man.

Remember when Parker's identity was supposed to be a **massive** part of who he was? Hopefully this goes somewhere good.

Peter's block of Beck's shot was done so well. There was something imposing and powerful about Parker's stance.

All the fight scenes were great.

Simmons back as JJ is brilliant.

However. Was anyone else annoyed by how dumb Peter was in giving up EDITH? He’s my favourite MCU character and I know he’s a kid but also... it was infuriating to watch

I thought it was obvious but maybe I'm underthinking it. Beck is DEAD! Mysterio is still alive as that balding fat guy(Ralphie) who took the flash drive out of PC?

Loved how B.A.R.F was Beck's invention and they incorporated it as his ""power."" I loved the costume. I hope we get much more Jake Gyllenhall(sp?)/ Myseterio even if it's an illusion.

Jake Gyllenhall's perfomance reminded me of him in Nightcrawler. It was awesome.

&#x200B;

Loved all the suits especially the night monkey one. Tom Holland is killing it at PP/ Spider-man. The train scence wasn't as iconic as SP2 but was shocking!

I liked that Homecoming was him wanting to be a superhero so bad and Far from home was him wanting a vacation from it.

&#x200B;

I wish Happy had to leave an awkward voicemail ala ""Swingers"" We needed more Marissa Tomei.

&#x200B;

The Brad sub-subplot was annoying. Zendaya was cool hanging out with him until the plot needed her not to be. Zendaya was pretty good otherwise. I really like her MJ character. Edgy but I feel she plays it ironically more than annoying.

Ned was great in homecoming but I didn't like him here. Betty Brandt's character was meh. I get that it was supposed to be a stereotypical Highschool relationship but it was weird.

&#x200B;

I liked all the posters of Stark and Iron man. Zombie Iron man was shocking... Too soon.

Edith really bothers me that there was no training wheels protocol. He can ""hack"" every phone and Drone strike anyone? Lucius Fox would not stand for this and Christopher Reeves wouldn't sit for this either. This defeats the purpose of CA: The Winter Soldier.

&#x200B;

I loved the mid-credit scene. I slmost jumped out of my seat. It feels impossible to re-cast Triple J as JK Simmons is the best. I know newspaper is an almost-dead medium but it may take me awhile for me to get used to Alex Jones JJJ. I did NOT like that his identity was revealed. I know not to doubt the MCU team/ Kevin Feige(Yes I know this is Sony but still MCU).

&#x200B;

I sort of disliked the end-credit scene. I know Talos is very familiar with Fury but was there any hints it wasn't him? Him not afraid of the drone strike before Maria Hill RPG'd it was way more Fury and I could not see Talos doing that.

I got the impression Fury was just on vacation after endgame but some others think he' been fury longer. Since he mentioned that he didn't really know the Avengers, I have doubts about that theory.

- Mysterio messing with Peter's mind, especially the scene in Germany with the many Spider-Men and mirrors. Very cool, very surreal, very well done. 


- All the high school humor was well done, as it was in Homecoming. 


- The post-credit scenes were great, I even loved the ""but then everything went off the rails"" by Talos. BUT it shouldn't have been a post credit scene. This stuff was too good for people to miss.

What I didn't like so much: 


- The pacing felt almost too fast. Everything happens very quickly. I sort-of had a similar issue with Ant-Man and the Wasp and other Marvel films. There's so much cool stuff happening and it's a bit of an overkill. But that didn't apply to every scene here. On the one hand it's great because the movie doesn't feel like forever but on the other it sometimes feels too fast. Also I think they cut the scene with the cops from the trailers.

Also I'm not sure why Beck died. On wikipedia it says ""misfired gun"" but how did it misfire? It was aimed at Peter, who stopped it. But where and when did it hit Beck?

et99uj4,"How come no one is talking about opening sequence?  For a brief moment after the Sony and Columbia title sequences, when the SUV was driving through the devastated Mexican city, I was worried the wrong film was being projected.  Then, when I saw Nick and Maria and later the standard Marvel title sequence, I realized the movie was basically setting a tone of illusion and how nothing is quite as it seems.  Maybe I'm too easily tickled when movie-makers try to be coy (or maybe I'm too gullible to think that the wrong movie can be played in a theater these days), but I genuinely enjoyed that.",c7xhmz
et9fraw,"Overall i thought it was lots of fun and was really well-acted. 

What I liked:

- The character-centered stuff was all really on-point. Charming teen love story between peter and mj. Mysterio was a memorable and well-acted villain. 

- themes of how to balance the work of a hero with a normal life were interesting and satisfying. Peter being a little over his head was nicely set up. 

- action scenes were well done.

What I didn’t like -

- I sort of missed the “classic” Spider-Man story of shit going wrong in NYC. Felt a bit like Spider-Man himself got overshadowed by the demands of the MCU as a whole. I hope the next one is more confined to a story about Peter Parker.

- as much as tony’s death played into the story, it felt like the movie didn’t really do much to engage with Peter grieving the loss of Tony. He basically lost his dad, but he seems pretty chill about it.

- “who will be the new Iron Man?” isnt a question I care about really. I’d rather know “what is the world like after half its people vanished?” and I feel like the movie didn’t spend much time on that second question.",c7xhmz
et9fwfz,"All I can think about when watching Jake play Mysterio was Louis Bloom from Nightcrawler.  Pretty sure that was the main reason he was cast as Mysterio and of course Jake knocked the role out the park.   Jake's dynamic with Peter was very similar to Louis and Rick, with the sociopathic-like faking praise and comradery in order to abuse their insecurity and trust.  Also the scene with Mysterio yelling at his crew, was also like Louis yelling out his list of demands to Rene Russo's character...a perfectionist demanding stuff with no empathy or remorse to others.  I freaking loved Nightcrawler, so I was happy to see these parallels",c7xhmz
et9hcoz,"I really love this movie. First of all, it's visually impressive with the CGI shown for the elementals and the illusions Mysterio used on Spider-Man. The action is also framed well with how easily you can follow Spider-Man despite all of his acrobatic maneuvers. 

Then there's the fact that we have Spider-Man globetrotting across Europe. It's refreshing instead of regurgitating another Spider-Man in NY movie. I know that upsets some classic Spidey fans, but I think it works because how the final scenes in the movie has him finally swinging around NYC""s skyscrapers, which feels symbolic with the narrative of Peter finally accepting full responsibility of being Spider-Man. 

MJ is fleshed out better as a character as oppose to some weird girl who shows up only to make zany comments. Her crush on Peter makes sense given how in Homecoming she kind of stalked him around, but Peter's sudden crush on MJ did feel out of the blue. It wasn't ever established in Homecoming given Peter's feelings for Liz. Still, they work because of how awkward both of them are. 

Love that the trailers hid the running gag of Ned and Betty getting together. I do like how Peter Parker is still the underdog despite being an Avenger. It makes you care about him and want to root for him on. I do wish we see more talk about Uncle Ben eventually who does exist given the initials on the suitcase. Moreover, it would give deeper material for Marissa Tomei to work with instead of just being the fun/hot Aunt. 

Mysterio as an villain was great thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, which echoed a bit of Nightcrawler narcissistic character. I did feel like we could have used another scene Beck and Peter together aside from the rooftop sequence to really drive home the friendship he developed with Peter. It would have made his betrayal with Peter more significant. 

So many Iron Man call backs. I love how Marvel acknowledges the greatest MCU line with ""Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave... with a box of scraps!"" Although it was comical how the call backs kept on showing how all these employees were scorn by Tony, I don't mind because Spider-Man always embraced its comic book goofiness (one of the reasons Amazing Spider-Man didn't work as well with its tonal problems). Does make you wonder what future villain will be created due to relations with Tony Stark. Is Doctor Doom going to be one? How about the real Mandarin that will show up in Shang-Chi? 

At the end Peter starting swinging a camera around and carried something like a shield, was that a call back to Cap in Endgame with the hammer and shield? 

The mid credits though... I'm now excited for Spider-Man 3 because of it. How the hell did Marvel manage to keep J.K. Simmons appearance from leaking? His come back as J.J. Jameson is awesome. That along with the whole identity reveal is why I'm excited for the third movie. 

Then there's also the Skrull reveal. How much of Nick Fury's appearance in past MCU movies are actually him now? Will the Skrulls ever do a heel turn especially with Talos?",c7xhmz

etjo8rv,What was that project download scene about? What did the other guy download?,c7xhmz
etk05jy,"So I'm assuming Mysterio didn't die? Because I don't even remember them showing how he died and then the last scene means he has a bigger plan obviously and I doubt his henchpeople are carrying it out since he became pretty dictator like over then. Also it would explain why he didn't need to transfer Edith over to Peter.

When Peter meets up with Fury to tell him about Mysterio, and it turns out Mysterio is conning him the entire time, is Fury part of the illusion? We see him (at least I thought I did) react to the illusion and then get shot, however next time we see Fury he's working with Mysterio in London. So was that Fury an illusion and if not, why are Mysterio and Fury acting like nothing happened.",c7xhmz

etziwav,"So here's a silly question that really isn't that important at all in the grand scheme of things but still had me wondering.

Spiderman destroyed a good number of EDITH's drones during the final fight with Mysterio. Does EDITH have some sort of repair and restocking feature that replenishes the satellite's supply? Is there some sort of Stark base that keeps inventory and resupplies as necessary?  Or do you suppose it just has its limited supply? 

On a similar note, how did mysterio ""upgrade"" the drones to have the advanced holographic projecting technology as well. I assume there's a way to upgrade the defense system remotely? Or did I miss something from the movie?

Yes, I know, trivial questions that are silly to even think about, but it's been bugging me for some reason and I'm curious as to what others think, and who knows maybe I missed something.",c7xhmz

esk6wna,"first things first, this movie's got everything. fun, action, romance, and WHAT IS THIS an emotional journey through grief and acceptance and responsibility?????? it's a very satisfying Spider-man film, with a great big hook for an ending. when I wasn't smiling, I was just watching in awe (open mouth and everything) because it was just that good to me

excuse me if these are out of order and sorry for the long ass recap, I mean it when I said I loved everything

- I didn't know whether to cry or laugh at the beginning. Was almost disappointed at no Spidey theme but holy shit that in memoriam segment
- IT'S SO NICE TO START THE FILM WITH PETER ALREADY LIKING MJ HIS PLANS WERE SO ADORABLE if not a little naive BUT CUTE
- combed through interviews and some of them had Tom directly address it as ""the blip"" 
- the footage from the gym was horrifying then suddenly hilarious, nice way to get through all the post-Endgame questions, especially BRAD and;
- Aunt May's organization for displaced housing. Got scared af when I thought Peter was going out without his mask on after talking to Happy
- the amount of times they've used the word ghosted in this film YOU DON'T GHOST NICK FURY
- ""Peter tingle""
- ""Bachelors in Europe""
- I love my teen films with a huge dose of cringe and awkwardness and they deliver it in spades
- amazing first(second?) showcase by Mysterio, poor Peter and the church bell my head hurt for him
- I love that EDITH stands for Even Dead I'm The Hero
- yes use million dollar tech for high school thing I love it sign me up for more
- non-verbatim ""Fury is the most paranoid and _______ person I've ever met""
- nice way to segue into the name ""Mysterio""
- Fury redirecting Peter's class trip is the exact kind of thing I miss him for
- I almost thought blonde lady was Sharon
- Martin Starr's character gets more manic by the hour and I love it, also JB Smoove and witchcraft
- Europe's very own night monkey
- the moment there was that sudden electric surge near the ferris wheel you already knew what was up, and the fact that Mysterio managed to defeat it this early on
- collective face palm at Peter giving EDITH away,
- but amazing 180 by Jake as soon as the projections went away
- great reuse of BARF by frustrated Stark employees and wow that iron man 1 throwback
- MJ knowing about Peter being Spider-man was expected because yes, Peter, people are just dumb at this point not to notice, but smart of them to incorporate the stealth suit because of suspicion.
- me in the moment: DAMMIT FURY DID NOT JUST GET SHOT AGAIN
- That breathtaking illusion sequence scared me more than the Skrulls, and him getting crashed by the train was so raw and brutal, the entire sequence was amazing to watch
- the Amsterdam location gag was a nice breather
- Brad being the only person noticing how insane this all is just adds to his character
- RIP tulips but thank god for happy. seeing him sew peter up was hard to watch, and Tom and Jon were so great in this very needed scene, especially Tom
- seeing Peter in sciencey action was so great, bonus ACDC too for the feels
- ""HOW DOES CAP DO IT""
- ""Avengers-level threat"" is a normal term now
- I love how the suit never pulled back on Peter's ingenuity, the bomb for the drones was a great way to show it, and they really put it through the ringer
- Peter catching Mysterio's gun was ""I have nothing to prove to you"" levels of cathartic and YAY THE PETER TINGLE IS BACK
- PETER FINALLY GETS THE GIRL
- way to go Ned and Betty, poor Flash

Midcredits
- SPIDER-MAN SWINGING THROUGH MANHATTAN, was expecting to look for a certain corporation's building but of course,
- Peter's life was going too well and it probably felt like too many people already knew so why not have it all come crashing down with NOT JUST AN IDENTITY REVEAL, BUT AN IDENTITY REVEAL WITH NONE OTHER THAN AN INFOWARS-ERA JJJ JK SIMMONS I slapped my thigh too hard at this moment
- ""you'll love what's coming next 1-2-3..."" FOUR

Post-credits
- I actually thought Fury acted like such an ass when he was asking Peter to drop everything to save the world again, turns out it was Talos
- where is he tho

A few things:
- Tom is Peter I will not hear anything else
- kinda relieved at no multi-verse, we already had a hard time with the time travel holes
- true to their word, there are no more stan cameos
- super pumped to see where the MCU is going especially since we have nothing on slate right now, knowing nothing feels so exciting again
- pack it up fam, the MCU is in good hands",c7xhmz

esqcadk,"I liked this more than a lot of the other responses I'm seeing in here.  I think it's probably my favorite Spider-Man movie, and my favorite superhero movie of the year.

What I liked: I'm going to start with the two credits scenes. I didn't see it until today, but I was able to stay completely spoiler free on those and I loved it.  I was losing it at JK Simmons appearance, I've been semi-vocally anti-Skrull in the MCU but liked the post credits scene, and I'm pumped for the future of the Spider-Man franchise. The Peter side of the movie worked better than the Spider-Man side, I really liked all the scenes of him just being a high school kid. Obviously Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal are great, but this movie is also the most I've ever liked Zendaya in something. And the first Mysterio vs. Spider-Man fight is great, it's a scene I feel like I'll be watching on Youtube for years (in that way it reminds me of the elevator scene in Winter Soldier).

What I didn't like: The Spider-Man stuff didn't work super well for me until the Mysterio reveal. I knew he was going to be a villain and the vague outlines of his plans so until it switched it just didn't feel like there were any stakes. While Gyllenhaal was great, I didn't really need Mysterio explaining his motivation and exactly how the plan worked to the people who already knew.

Quick Nick Fury aside: My read is that Talos has only been impersonating him for a short time. I don't think the real Nick Fury would have missed Tony's funeral, and I think this movie took place roughly a year later, so perhaps as long as a year but no longer.

This is a 4/5 for me. I was mildly disappointed in Endgame, and this movie kind of restored my excitement for the MCU.",c7xhmz

et0bzvw,"YES JK SIMMONS
Still needed a menace line but I’ll excuse this.

Overall it was a solid 6.5/10 for me. Visually, it was phenomenal. Saw it in real IMAX so the extra aspect ratio for the big sequences felt awesome. They really nailed Mysterio in his fights. The illusions were straight out of the Spider-Man comics, games and cartoons which was a blast. Loved Spidey actually looking like Spidey too unlike in Homecoming. We had a plethora of his moves on display and he was actually super acrobatic. Props to finally getting some great swinging action in NY too.

Story wise I think it was too safe and nothing was really groundbreaking. It felt like an extended filler episode of the animated series but with the usual Marvel flare and comedic moments. I thought the whole vacation hijacking was hilarious and there was a good amount of screen time for the whole class for it to actually feel like a school trip. With that said, Peter’s personal growth could have been handled a bit better and been more grounded or relatable, which is the basis of Peter Parker. I’m still not a fan of Uncle Ben pretty much being replaced with Tony as the sort of idol/father figure to Peter, and it’s not everyday that your big mess up is entrusting the glasses to a drone army to a supposed hero.

Anyways, still a fun movie to see and I’m interested if they actually will chase a true multiverse story in future Marvel movies.",c7xhmz

et737z6," *Far From Home* places the last pieces of the foundation of who the MCU Peter Parker is in contrast to past portrayals. After the death of most of the Avengers, the heroes still make an appearance: there is a slideshow for Black Widow, they study Thor in Physics class, Peter wields a broken sign like a Captain America shield. This Peter grew up in a world saturated with heroes, apparently [even saw Iron Man in action as a kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kriY9C0uwgs). It makes sense why he is a little different, personality-wise than the other live-action portrayals. It emphasizes his connections to *these* heroes, that audience also grew up with and followed, and pulls him back into the bigger world.

etccpwd,"The movie was not a masterpiece for sure, the first half was really below but the second half saved the whole movie by itself ( I cut the movie the moment peter gave the glasses to mysterio).
Jake totaly nailed mysterio, I only knew the charactere from the xbox game spiderman 2 but I totaly believed he was a good guy.
My favorite scene was the ilusion scene, it was so great because as a spectator we know what special effects are but in the movie specials effect become reality since you have no way to know if you are being tricked or not and all the mind game mysterio pulled of waw actualy clever.

I don't know if anyone has mentioned it before but I think the reason peter managed to get acces to the glasses back so easely was because Tony knew that Peter would fucked up and being tricked into giving them to some weirdo so he gave Peter permanant  control over them .",c7xhmz

like seriously? what exactly did he want? to be the next tony stark, then what? what was his end goal?

esllvqd,"I’m biased because Mysterio is my all time fav Spidey villain but hot damn his portrayal exceeded my expectations and catapulted this to my favorite Spidey film ever, the hallucinations scenes with Peter seeing copies of himself and + the scenes showing how Mysterio does what he does gave me major Spider Man 2 video game vibes and I LOVED it. 

While Mysterio and Jake Gylenhaal easily stole the show I think Zendaya and Tom Holland do such an amazing job of portraying that awkward teen stage of “I like them but I’m not sure if they like me back” that a bunch of us go through, and they have really good chemistry. (Aren’t they dating in real life too?)

Also HOLY SHIT HOW DID THEY GET JK SIMMONS BACK WITHOUT ANY LEAKS OR ANY RUMORS ???!?

I liked the Skrull reveal at the end because during the movie it was way way too much of a stretch for me to believe that Quentin could fool Fury so easily. That removed what would’ve been my biggest complaint of the movie. If I had any other criticism it would be that the MCU (And really comic book movies in general) has a really shitty habit of killing off amazing villains.

Peter's arc of trying to become the ""new Iron Man"" and learning to just be Spider-Man was genius and totally felt natural for this iteration of Peter Parker to go through. I was skeptical of Zendaya's MJ since she's so deviant from the comics, but I actually think she and Peter are a great couple and totally fit with each other. 

Mysterio, while his motivations was a little wonky, was still a really cool villain. Truly a first in comic book movies to have the antagonist be a showman who's just pretending to have powers. Everyone in the Marvel Fandom knew Mysterio was going to end up being a villain and that he was likely using tech to fake the Elementals, but the build up and reveal was done super well and constantly kept me second guessing it. Also, the illusion scene in the abandoned warehouse was literally one of the favorite MCU moments ever.  JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson again is another. 

This was a just a great movie. Not only entertaining, but well written too. I hope Sony renews their deal with Marvel and we get a third film to finish the trilogy with Jon Watts at the helm. This Spidey franchise is shaping up to really be something special!",c7xhmz

You don’t have to show the origin story and shoot uncle Ben for twenty minutes to have Ben be recognised as an important part of peters life and the key reason peter became spider man. Spider-Verse had a brief flashback of Ben and Peter telling Miles you can’t tell everybody. It was meaningful to Peters history.

Possible evidence: Peter had to confirm transferring EDITHs control over to Beck. The movie made a big deal about this. Yet when Peter got them back, Beck didn’t have to relinquish control. 
Makes everything after more suspicious, including EDITH saying that there were no illusions regarding Becks death. 
Otherwise, when did Mysterio film the video that showed at the end where he revealed Peter is Spider-Man?? We watched the whole interaction where he “died” on the bridge from Peters point of view.yet in the video, Mysterio clearly filmed his rant about Peter from beside him on the bridge. He’s got to be alive.
 
Mysterio could have put in a failsafe plan for EDITH to follow if he ever lost control, in order for Spider-Man to think he was dead. 

Pls Marvel don’t go back to killing all your interesting villains :’(",c7xhmz

It doesn’t conflict with EDITH telling Peter that no illusions are active, which was not the response he was asking about and also worded extremely carefully. Thoughts?

Seeing J. K. Simmons as JJJ at the end blew me out of my seat. I was NOT expecting that. Also, of course, Talos and Soren were a surprise as well. Begs the question, ""okay, Nick is off in space, but I didn't see Maria...?""

The only thing I couldn't understand was that the EDITH glasses seemed to immediately pop up all information about anyone Peter looked at, regardless of whether they asked him to or not. So why didn't the glasses alert Peter to exactly who Quentin Beck was the moment he donned them and looked at him in the bar?

One of my few quibbles was that it felt like Nick Fury (the most paranoid man alive) was way too quick to trust Beck... but that was explained away in the post-credits scene.

In this it doesn't completely mean that the original basics are thrown out either. For example, Peter Parker will never sew his own suit again. BUT he will create it with Stark Tech.


There's just a lot of things that's almost classic, such as Peter working for the Bugle. Or even how MJ is typically portrayed, maybe even throw a bit of Gwen and Aunt May, that's completely changed.

Mysterio was fantastic. His heel turn was pretty obviously going to happen but it was still a great moment when the penny dropped. The full-on Mysterio illusions were amazing.

Wasn't crazy about how Iron-man centric the story was. That's 2 Spider-Man movies in a row with a main villain who was the result of Iron-Man's actions.

The teen-romance-comedy was pretty take it or leave it. MJ didn't really feel like she had anything to do for most of the movie.

Spider-Man vs drones was... not terribly interesting. The final bit with him using Spider-sense against them was great but the proceeding moments of him jumping around and killing drones were pretty standard MCU-late-movie-cgi-fest.

""They were Skrulls all along"" is exactly the sort of left-field comic book logic I hoped the MCU would never delve into. Didn't like the decision to make Nick Fury extra grumpy for the movie for a quick gotcha like that at the end.

esk4ghw,JK MOTHERFUCKING SIMMONS BABY,c7xhmz
esk5ely,"**Some ramblings off the top of my head - spoilers for pretty much everything:**

* The Iron Man tribute at the start... I wanted to laugh but it was somewhat touching. I love how The Snap/The Blip was touched on in the film. Also why was Cap in the memoriam tribute? He dead already? Granted I dunno how old he’s supposed to now but maybe it’s getting close to his time, haha. More likely the world doesn’t know about Cap coming back as an old man but I still found him being in the memoriam amusing.

* The CGI in this was fuckin’ wild. The illusions allowed Marvel to do stuff with CGI I don’t think they’ve ever done before. Zombie Iron Man rising from his grave was definitely the highlight for me.

* Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio was amazing and I almost wish he was this guy from another world fighting the Elementals. Peter having someone to talk superhero stuff to was so nice. I also felt for Mysterio when his fingers trailed over the marital ring on his finger. Man cooked up a good BS story. All the other members of Mysterio's cohort were good to. The trailers did a great job of hiding that Mysterio was the real villain. Bless Marvel and Sony for not ruining this movie by revealing too much in the trailers.

* The only weird part of the movie that felt off to me was when Mysterio took down the Fire Elemental. It felt too quick a victory and then for Mysterio to have not died felt cheap. BUT, this whole scene sat so much better to me within like the next 10 minutes of the movie.

* The fight scene with the Fire Elemental in Berlin was intense and so great, felt like a big step-up for Spidey since Homecoming. It really felt like the Fire Elemental could be this massive threat.

* The ‘fake-outs’ and twists in this movie were well-executed I feel. Mysterio being a villain caught me off-guard and ‘Fury shooting him and saving Peter’ also had me going for the brief moment it lasted. The illusion fading away in the bar when Mysterio received Edith was so awesome. Initially, I had no idea if the illusion was all Edith’s doing. Mysterio and co’s use of the drones and projectors was amazing and a cool way of having a villain without any powers whom on the surface level appeared to be doing mystical shit.

* The cinematography in the Netherlands was really pretty, especially the tulip field. Probably one of the most colourful shots Marvel’s ever done.

* Fury constantly hi-jacking Peter’s trip was fun banter. I also enjoyed the antics of Peter’s teachers and classmates.

* Maria taking out the drone that otherwise could have ended Fury was awesome.

* Peter’s Spidey-Senses, oh sorry, his Peter Tingle was definitely on display and used better in this movie than all Spidey’s before it. Watching Peter fight the drones while they were still cloaked in illusions I think highlighted how Peter was the optimal person to fight Mysterio.

* Peter swinging around the bridge constantly and taking out drone after drone also had me hyped. I don’t think Spidey is viewed as the strongest Avengers but his strength, agility, and endurance were all on display here. He’ll likely only get more experienced with age too so it’s not hard to believe Spidey could be one of the Avenger’s best.

* This movie felt really grounded and human, not just because of Peter’s struggles. MJ’s struggle to get close to people, her tendency to blabber out random morbid facts, and her overall weirdness was also really effective I feel. I like how this take on MJ is clearly different from Mary-Jane in Raimi’s movies.

* Spidey designing his own suit on the plane with Back In Black playing in the background was amazing. Glad to see Led Zeppelin making another appearance in the Marvel films.

* Speaking of Raimi’s movies, just couldn’t recast J. Jonah Jameson now could they? Hoping to see more of J.K. Simmons in future.

* The mid-credits scene was amazing and the scene prior to it with Peter sitting down with his Aunt and Happy made me believe he might have been going public with his identity then. But nope, Mysterio gets the last laugh apparently. Hoping Spidey gets out of this alright but seems Peter might not have an alibi at this stage.

* No idea what Fury’s up to but glad to see the Skrulls again. Interesting that none of the Avengers had any cameos here but maybe why they didn’t show up to help Talos/Fury will be revealed in future.

Overall, super enjoyable, Marvel shits out another golden nugget.",c7xhmz

Did old man Steve die of natural causes, or did the Avengers and the government provide the public with an ""official story"" that says he died in battle during the events of Endgame? The fact that the video used a picture of young Steve makes me lean towards the idea that the public thinks he died fighting Thanos.

And while I expected the heel turn from Mysterio, part of me actually did want him to be a hero just to keep Gyllenhaal around in the MCU.

If I have one gripe, it's that the MCU is starting to feel just a bit like a big-screen TV show. ""Previously on the MCU..."" is basically what the beginning was, and then the cliffhanger post-credits scenes to make you go ""WTF?!"" and have to tune in next season.

eufizh5,"It doesn't feel so much like a Spiderman movie as it does the MCU movie that came immediately after Endgame. I get that the typical Spiderman story of a kid trying to hide his superhero identity and balance his two lives might be a bit played out but these mind-numbing endless CGI action sequences where entire cities get destroyed are way more played out. The best parts of the movie for me were definitely the Spidey vs. Mysterio illusion bits. In those moments the scale of the movie was toned back a bit, with just our hero and our villain in a 1v1 battle, where the hero has to learn how to use one of his abilities (instead of relying on over-the-top technology) in order to win. That felt more like Spiderman to me than the rest of it.

I’m not expecting some sort of proverbially written masterpiece from the writers of a fucking Spider-Man movie but goddamn I could not refrain from laughing sometimes at how predictable yet ridiculous some of the scenes with Spider-Man and MJ or even for the small moments of Mysterio and Spider-Man were. The first action scene with Mysterio against Spider-Man was easily the highlight of the movie for me, and the following action scenes we’re also pretty neat, but I felt like I was in a children’s sitcom for a large part of the film and it just took me totally out of it.",c7xhmz

His ""true"" costume with motion capture suit and plastic HUD was a great reinterpretation of character design. Also now that Peter is living in Manhattan we can expect more web-slinging action in the upcoming movies. And, of course, the return of one true JJJ was an unexpected treat.

That all said, I think everything in the movie happened all too fast. The scene where MJ and Peter figure out Mysterio was using projections seemed awfully convenient. I find it hard to believe that his friends would believe Peter that fast when they've just been in the middle of ""the attack"". (The drones, however, were nicely foreshadowed)

eslparh,"* It is a little goofier than the Earth-based MCU Films tend to be. But that's not necessarily bad and this movie serves its purpose of decompressing from the meta-narrative of this Phase of the MCU.

* There's only two scenes that I'd call too goofy, or bad; the first is Mysterio's exposition dump in the bar where he introduces his crew to audience with the flashbacks. The flashbacks themselves weren't bad, but the dialogue was too, ""Hey, Audience, we're doing the explaining bit now."" Thankfully, the rest of the scenes with his crew were solid, and it's especially fun to see Mysterio direct the hologram rehearsal. Gyllenhall killed it. 

* The second bad scene was Happy and the kids inside the vault. The confession-under-fire cliche is kind eh, and it seemed like they really wanted to give MJ some character depth, but the comedy of the scene didn't super work, and it seemed forced. 

* The rest of Peter's class are mostly totally fine, but I feel like Brad should either have been more important, or been cut. I understand the narrative purpose of his character, but it was pretty flat. 
* The CGI sections of Peter being trapped in Mysterio's illusions were fantastic. Interesting visuals, disorienting camera work (in a good way), and solid fight choreography. 
* The post-credits scenes bump this up from a 7 to an 8 for me. JK Simmons was the best part of the Rami spiderman films, so having him back as Jonah is fantastic, and the name reveal is something we haven't seen in the other spiderman franchises, so that could be nice. 

* I'm kind of over Peter being in highschool, so hearing that he's still on 16 in this one is kind of a bummer. I'm ready for college spiderman. 
* I also hope he loses access to Tony's gear. Spiderman is a gadget heavy hero, but he's not really the kind that normally has a private jet to call on, and I think he's better that way. Harder to root for the underdog, working man hero when he's got billions of dollars of tech at his beck and call.  

* Overall, this is movie functional, fun, and elevated by a few moments of true surprise.",c7xhmz
esmhhot,"This is my favorite Spider-man movie to date. And may even be my favorite Marvel movie. I have always liked how Spider-man isn't just a superhero movie, but is also a coming-of-age story for Peter Parker. Jake Gylenhaal was great casting and an all around great villain. The CGI is the amazing and I love it when Marvel gets real trippy with the visuals ala Doctor Strange. Also, this has to be the funniest Marvel movie, I mean their movies are clever and funny, but this one for some reason really gave me some good belly laughs, especially at the start with how they explained how the snap affected the students and Stark's tribute. 

Also that first scene after the credits was wow! What a great way to wrap up Phase 3. Can't wait for the next to see how Peter Parker handles being known as Spider-man.",c7xhmz

In his dying moments, he absolutely ruined the life of a 16 year old kid, made him and his loved ones who are also mostly teenagers targets for every criminal and vigilante in the world, and left the world believing he was really a hero.

Obviously the snap was the in-canon biggest and most far-reaching event, but the effects of that only carried between the 2 films it was concerned with. Zeno may have torn apart the Avengers, but that only felt relevant across Civil War and Infinity War and was cleaned up with relatively little effort. Peter absolutely cannot just resolve this problem quickly, and I feel like this will somehow play in to other movies and heroes as well. If they somehow don't get it proven to them that the video is fake, there are some very powerful heroes out there that might be hunting for him now.",c7xhmz

I think Homecoming does that better as well as Raimi's Spidey 1 and 2. I absolutely love Mysterio and Happy though. Regardless, I appreciate how well they are moving forward with Peter's story post-Stark/Endgame but I still miss the *friendly neighborhood Spiderman*. Really wish they'd show him do some of his usual hero work around NYC earlier and in the end.

The fight choreography and camera work during Spidey's sequences are great. Everything is all over the place and fast but they still didn't lose me. That's unlike what Michael Bay usually does. Large, bombastic and chaotic effects but in FFH its still easy to follow. And Illusion sequences are trippy as hell especially the battle at the construction.

et31az0,"I thought it was a good, fun movie and I kind of liked how it felt like a continuation of Endgame. I also thought the illusion scene's in Peter's Mind were amazing and really unique. 

But there is one thing that the Raimi Spiderman films have that the MCU Spiderman barely has, which are hand-to-hand combat scenes. All of the MCU's Spiderman's fights are really cinematic, but there's no continuous punching or kicking. It's more like explosions and dramatic movements.

Spiderman's fights versus Mysterio were really beautiful and still really cool, but if you look at Raimi's Spiderman 2 Train Fight scene against Doc Ock, you can see that they consistently trade punches with each other, and it's interesting to see who can land a harder punch.

The MCU Spiderman fights are more like action scenes rather than fight scenes. I want to see Spiderman fight like Captain America does in Winter Soldier, boxing and kicking and maybe even grappling or submissions.",c7xhmz

I'll admit, I hadn't read any of the Mysterio comics going into the film, so I didnt know *for sure* that he was a villain. Either way, I was glad they went that route with him.

After all, he's *not* a hero (nor arguably a 'villain' in the cinematic sense); he's literally just an actor. The whole time, he's wrapped up in this deluded scheme to gain approval points for his ""role"" as a ""hero"" - directly damaging civilians in the process.

-The introductory “In Memoriam” video was very tasteful as the “Marvel Studios” logo came on and turned into a great dive into the high school perspective that these films go for as it continued.

-Peter designing his suit in the jet mirroring Tony perfectly and Happy noticing this with a heartwarming gaze

-Beck was not-so-subtly the exact opposite of Tony – something he saw as virtuous, but as we all know was not. Tony – “Even Dead, I’m the Hero”. Beck – Even when he was dead he was still the villain. 

-Marisa Tomei ass

While really well done and handled very differently, I was absolutely shocked Marvel did such a “normal” presentation of the character. I was really expecting a twist where he **really was** from another Earth, but his MCU-world version was around and evil. Having him just be... well... the bad guy behind it all felt almost too expected. That said, Gyllenhaal did an amazing job with the role and it was written and performed super well.

It's clear hes still in the process of grieving and I'm glad that they showcase that without it really eclipsing everything. It's just a presence that motivates Peter and affects him but it's not the core to the movie.

esrscxk,"Enjoyed Jake Gylenhaal as Mysterio, Peter+MJ interactions, and humor in this movie.  
  
That being said I got problems with it.    

- Tired of seeing the ""villain is someone the Stark family carelessly wronged"" trope. I know it made for fun callbacks but this one was the flimsiest yet and it's been done to death at this point. They did that with Vulture in the first movie but there was much more to him and I felt his motivations were much stronger than Mysterio's in this movie.  
- The climax of the movie was underwhelming drone destruction. Hard to match the awesome Mysterio illusion fight from earlier but it felt very mindless. Also the ""Peter can't use his powers"" thing felt really tacked on/ underutilized. (Compare to Spider-Man 2 where they took time to develop that)  
- The first movie was all about Peter trying to prove to Tony that he can be his own hero, but I was excited to see where it would go from there. Where it went in this movie is...Peter trying to prove to Fury that he can literally be the next Iron Man? Odd direction that will only fuel the annoying people who just call Tom Holland Spidey ""Iron Man Jr.""  
- I hate everything about the five year difference between people because of The Blip. It was utilized so awkwardly in this movie with Brad (out of nowhere) and I'm still questioning the bigger decision to do that.",c7xhmz

The post-credits scene had me choking on my popcorn. JK Simmons is magnificent in its own right but somehow that wasn't even what I'm most excited about. Outing Peter as Spider-Man felt similar to the ending on John Wick 2. Everyone is going to be out to get him.  Obviously, not just anyone will able to get him. This task requires someone who will get the job done. Enter Kraven The Hunter. In an ideal world, I'd have Benicio Del Toro playing him but he's already been in The MCU so what can you do. Oscar Isaac is the man who I believe could nail the role. I know I'm getting carried away but that's just how perfect the cliffhanger is.

Like Happy saying he's in love with Spiderman's aunt, super traceable in my opinion. Then he drops MJ off in the middle of NY, like that doesn't start feeling strange eventually.

Once the pace started to pick up a bit midway through Act 2 I thoroughly enjoyed it.

The humour and tone I found a bit inconsistent.  With Homecoming you had the 'awkward' humour sprinkled periodically throughout and always hit the mark, in FFH it felt like they were just firing everything at it just to see what stuck and it made the tone quite jarring as well similar to how GOTGVol2 undercut each serious moment with a joke, this issue with FFH is it couldn't decide on a tone, especially when it came to the Mysterio mindfuck scene(one of my all time favourite MCU moments) with Zombie Iron Man.

And the 2nd point being

Why would Tony pass on clearly unnecessary and dangerous equipment to Peter especially when A) he gave him the whole 'if your nothing without the suit then you shouldn't have it' and B) gave him the Iron Spider which should of  been more than enough - just seemed like a forced plot point.

etjdifg,"Can we talk for a moment about how stellar the writing was and how on point the foreshadowing and acting? This screenplay was pretty damn masterful and the actors executed it flawlessly. Eg:

- I love how ""Even Dead, I'm the Hero"" not only applies to Tony but also hints at the final twist in the mid-credits scene
- Jackson and Hill totally had me feeling at the back of my head that something was slightly off the entire time, especially with the ""don't invoke her name"" line, but it was done juuuuust right so you were never sure if things were simply illusive or if there was legit something off about them, right from the start
- The entire climax giving us just enough villain dialog to guess that there's more going on than meets the eye, leaving us to evaluate what might have been done with/to Edith off screen. Kicking the finale off with ""they'll believe what I tell them to believe"" was so perfect.

eske90q,"This was..okay. There were some good moments here and there, but overall it was disappointing for me.

I really, really dislike that this is essentially yet another Tony fuckup. Why the hell would he have made this drone army? What *possible* help could they be against superpowered threats? None, right? The only practical use they have is to take out human targets, and the idea of him making a system like that after Ultron feels like a complete betrayal of his character. Even worse, why would you give that kind of responsibility to a sixteen year-old kid who had already shown he was hesitant to become a full-time hero?

Mysterio ended up falling flat for me as a villain, too. I liked him for the first half of the film when it was clear he was masterfully manipulating everyone, but after getting Edith he just became *boringly* evil imo. His and Peter's early dynamic had actually been pretty great, with Beck presenting himself as exactly what Peter needed in Tony's absence, but their interactions after that point felt oddly impersonal and lacking in emotional weight, which is a real step down after Vulture. If it wasn't for all of this I'd probably be more annoyed that they (seemingly) killed him off. I also thought most of the action (including the battles against the fake Elementals) was a **literal** CGI borefest. The warehouse illusion nightmare was visually cool, though.

Even the final reveal of Peter's identity being made public was a little disappointing tbh. After Endgame, I was hoping that Spidey's story would deescalate and allow him to focus on the smaller stuff, but now his world has been thrown upside down all over again. Oh well.

Other thoughts:

* J.K Simmons back as J. Jonah Jameson is amazing, and that reveal was the most exciting moment of the movie for me.

* Peter building his suit to AC/DC music as Happy watches was great.

* Skrull involvement was cool.

* With how careless Peter was about being unmasked in public, it feels like his identity would have come out eventually anyway.",c7xhmz
etibsjr,"Saw it last night. Really loved it and, while I didn't think it was possible, I liked it more than Homecoming and now sits somewhere around 2nd or 3rd favorite MCU movie behind Infinity War and possibly End Game (still working out the order in my head).

Things I really liked:

Mysterio was really well acted. Whether you knew about Mysterio before the movie or not, you could tell something was off in the first few elemental scenes. It just felt like a more generic super hero movie in the first half, but I think that's what the movie was going for.

Holland and Zendaya killed it. Really great acting in the whole movie from everyone and Holland is my definitive peter parker now. He doesn't look like a 30-year-old playing a high-schooler like Tobey Maguire. Holland's charm and how he's playing the character definitely beats out Andrew Garfield, though I'll acknowledge that Garfield wasn't exactly dealing with good writing.

The first scene where Peter is put into the illusions was one of my favorite MCU scenes. Furthermore, the last fight scene/climax were really well-done. Spider-man actually beating Mysterio was impactful as well. Something about a gun to a head just feels more grounded and impactful than a superpowered alien preparing to destroy the world.

These movies just keep surprising in a good way. I honestly give it a 9/10 and I can be picky.",c7xhmz

esveh1y,"I didn't get this:
Spider man told EDITH to give all access to Quentin Beck. When EDITH was successful in doing that, shouldn't Spidey be wondering how EDITH had data on a person from EARTH 833 when they're on Earth 616.

EDITH needs all physical data for matching and  authorizing the owner. Right? 

So much for being the smartest one in the room?",c7xhmz

et2t8x2,"I have two qualms about the movie. Other than that i really enjoyed the film.

It seems that Peter was extremely incompetent in trying not to reveal his identity. From just having a drink at a bar with his ""night monkey"" suit still on, just having a opera mask in Venice when fighting and showing his face on the London bridge.

Also are we meant to believe that the hologram technology was already preinstalled on every EDITH drone?",c7xhmz
et5t7yq,"Movie was awesome, but I wish>! Mysterio hadn't been shown to be a murderous narcissist so immediately after his deceit was revealed!<.

etna7bz,"I loved this film. For me it was the best Spider Man or Spider Man 2 was. A lot of people are unhappy with it, so I guess I’m in the minority. 

I actually watched Nick and Maria mention ‘sleeper agents’ and I thought they said Kree. I’ve only found out through this thread they are Skrulls, I did wonder why Fury was being a bit more of a dick than usual & why he didn’t even harbour a doubt about Beck according to Maria. They both seemed cold in this film now I think about it & finding out they’re Skrulls imo is testament to both the writing and acting to play their roles slightly different but not obviously noticeable. I haven’t seen Captain Marvel yet, I mistakenly believed it wouldn’t matter that much to this story but that’s my bad. 

The cinematography and visuals in general were perfect, particularly the web slinging & the Mysterio scenes where Parker gets his ass kicked. I feel like Mysterio was done perfectly. 

I don’t care that I knew he was going to be a villain throughout, we’ve never seen him on the big screen before, for the script to have Mysterio play out as the good guy for the first half and then quickly delve into him turning out deranged was the best way they could have played it. Not everyone knew he was a villain as hard as it is to us more in-the-know fans to believe. 

JJJ cameo and the reveal got me so hyped. I’m excited for where the story goes from here. 

Tom Holland is an incredible actor, his scenes with him grieving over Tony were moving and he just has this quality that makes Peter feel more real somehow. And he suits both Parker and Spider Man perfectly though Homecoming & Avengers made this clear. 

If it’s not the best Spider Man film it’s a close second. I’d say probably 6th or 7th in MCU.",c7xhmz

But that first half was real boring, I thought they really underdeveloped Mysterio as a hero and they didn't really try very hard in making his story believable.

At this particular theater chain, they typically have an employee welcome the audience to the theater and give a basic (but often personalized by each employee) message about the not talking, putting away cell phones, etc. So at my showing, JON WATTS was the employee. Then he goes on to say that some special guests are in the building and calls up handful of folks including the movie's screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, Amy Pascal, AND KEVIN FUCKING FEIGE who goes on to introduce John as the guy who directed the film and says thanks for coming in the most casual way.

eswq5em,"Far from Home continues Homecoming’s world building as it once again successfully shows life in the MCU universe. The events of Endgame have an impact on Peter’s arc and the overall plot, the idea of super heroes and villains showing up is a part of the characters’ lives, and the ever-growing roster of characters and events that can be referenced is utilized in fun ways. Peter goes through the classic Spider-Man struggle of balancing his personal life with being a hero, though this time it ties directly into the plot instead of being a personal obstacle to overcome. Jake Gyllenhaal seems to be having fun playing Mysterio, Tom Holland is charming, and Zendaya gets to shine this time as well. The first act has some pacing issues and judging by the trailers there was a ton of stuff left on the cutting room floor. There are also some logical leaps and the villain’s plan hinges on big conveniences and assumptions. It doesn’t really detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, though, and it has surprises and jokes to distract from faults.",c7xhmz

esog1n5,"found it interesting how the movie was in a lot of ways, an Iron Man 4 and also sort of a cover version of the first Iron Man movie,

2. Tony goes overseas and just wants to party while Rhodey was trying to get him to take the mission seriously. Peter goes overseas and just wants to relax while Talos!Fury was trying to get him to take the mission seriously. 

3. Tony is kidnapped by the 10 Rings, meets Yinsen who teaches him how to be a hero, and gets a new suit. Peter is kidnapped by Talos!Fury’s operation, meets Mysterio who tells him to be selfish and get the girl, and gets a stealth suit. 

4. Tony finds out Stark Industries was giving his tech to the 10 Rings and using his it to terrorize people, and makes it his mission to stop them. Peter gives EDITH to Mysterio and finds out he is using EDITH to terrorize people, and makes it his mission to stop him. 

5. Stane was a disgruntled Stark employee who wants the company all to himself. Mysterio is a disgruntled Stark employee who wants Stark tech all to himself. 

6. Pepper infiltrates Stane’s computer for some intel and escapes Stane with the help of Coulson. MJ gets a piece of Mysterio’s drone and escapes Mysterio’s attacks with the help of Happy. 

7. Tony builds/perfects the suit he has earlier in the movie but is handicapped by a weak arc reactor. Peter builds/perfects the suit he has earlier in the movie but is handicapped by his webshooters running out. 

8. Stane is ultimately defeated by the same tech he was coveting the whole movie. Mysterio is ultimately defeated by the same tech he was coveting the whole movie. 

9. Iron Man ends with Tony telling the world he is Iron Man. FFH ends with the world finding out that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. 

10. Iron Man post credits scene is Nick Fury revealing a much larger universe than the movie shows. FFH post credits scene is Nick Fury revealing a much larger universe than the movie shows.",c7xhmz

But it got me thinking as to why Homecoming didn't work as well for me and I think what it comes down to is the setting of the film. When I go to see a Spider-Man movie I really want to see webswinging and acrobatics. I feel loke Homecoming missed a lot of opportunities to showcase that by putting all the action set pieces in environments where that's just not really possible (a park, a boat, an airplane, a beach). I felt like Far From Home on the other hand did a better job playing to the character's strengths. Scenes like the clock tower falling, the fire elemental fight, and the final showdown (especially that part where he lands on the bridge in the spidey pose) were what I wanted.

2) how did Beck die? His hologram self was shot, but when did his real body die?

3) the scientist who worked the ARC reactor and now works for Beck — what did he download when Beck died? There was a brief second where we can see something like “Drone Program Downloaded 100%” before we cut away, but does this mean he’ll be another villain? If so, who?

This is a very fun and funny movie, just like Spider-Man should be.",c7xhmz

What an absolute fantastic film. The Dutch guy was Jeroen van Koningsbruggen. A respected Dutch comedian. Was an amazing suprise to see him in the film. Mysterio reminded me of my fights with him in [the 2001 ps1 game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJZny1N0yJM).

I mean, doesn't his suit from infinity war already have an AI that tony made? And the suit also makes a good balance too, like it gives spiderman an identity while clearly having a Stark legacy to it. Nothing about the glasses screams spiderman though. I can just not imagine spiderman using an enormous army of drones in any way, shape, or form. Seems to me like in the next film, the glasses will maybe be used for a gag, like that whole thing with brad in the bus, or it'll play an extremely minor role. Hell, take the aforementioned suit he got from Tony in infinity war for example, it was used to open some curtains and then it was written out of the script because Europe trip, even though Fury could have easily gotten it.

Maybe I'll eat my hat though, I vaguely remember some spiderman comic had him using (tiny?) spider drones (that'd be pretty funny if he redesigned the Edith drones to resemble spiders), so I guess we'll see.",c7xhmz

The Illusion sequences were really well done, and the fight scenes were what you would expect from an MCU movie.  I was going to give this movie a 7/10 but then in the mid credit scene to my surprise they brought in JK Simmons to reprise his role as J. Jonah Jameson for a cameo appearance which put a huge smile on my face and seeing how that scene went I hoping to see more of Simmons in the next MCU Spiderman film.

euaem0u,"IMO overall alright, not especially great.

The first half is suffocating with its cheap humor. Except for one joke that really got me, I was mostly frustrated and bored. Also, the way Europe was shot was shockingly bland and cheap looking. Venice looked like a movie studio, I was rather taken aback. I've been to Venice, it's not hard to make it look more impressive than this movie did.

Second half is where the movie picked up for me. I predicted one of the major twists from just watching the first trailer, but the execution was still fun.

The references to Tony Stark got annoying, but what you're gonna do.

Mysterio was fun, visually pretty cool and Gyllenhall is always great.

All the returning actors did great, CGI was a vast immprovement over Homecoming and I still love MJ and Ned as characters.

The two twists in the post credit scene were fun. The return of *that* character was an awesome concept. The execution was so and so, but he's still awesome.

Not one of the best MCU movies and definitely not the best Spiderman movies ever, as some are saying. Homecoming had inferior CGI but was an overall better movie. And it's not even in the same league as Raimi's first two or Spiderverse.

6.5/10

EDIT: Biggest problem I have with the plot is how Mysterio used to work with Tony Stark and yet this didn't come up at all. Shield didn't check to see whether this guy had a past. No facial recognition. No background check. They just went with his story.",c7xhmz

I was hesitant not only as to whether or not Marvel could follow up Endgame with another decent movie so soon, but also if they could continue the great job they’ve done with Spider-Man so far. But I’m happy to say that I think they pretty much nailed it!

The character of Mysterio was handled so well, and the personal journey Peter went on during this film (grappling with being Tony’s replacement and his relationship with MJ) felt so genuine and came to a satisfying conclusion. The humour was pretty spot-on (personal highlights include the “in memoriam” segment at the very beginning, as well as Ned & Betty’s relationship) and I liked they way they handled the “blip”.

My one gripe with this movie is the scene where we discover that Mysterio is “evil” - by him toasting each and every one of his helpers, it basically turned into a 5 minute exposition scene where Quentin is pretty much just narrating his entire plan to the audience in a monologue. It felt kind of lazy in terms of writing, but I do love the fact that Mysterio wasn’t working alone and there was a whole team of people behind his plans. In contrast, my absolute favourite scene was the illusion fight scene in Berlin - it felt like it was something straight out of the pages of the comic books; the imagery was amazing, particularly the zombie Iron Man and Spidey stuck inside Mysterio’s helmet/snowglobe.

And of course I’m really intrigued as to where that mid-credits scene will take the series next. A bold move for sure, but by now I’ve learned to trust Marvel.

Overall a solid 8.5, maybe even 9/10 (admitted bias since I am a huge Spidey fan after all) and this film just further solidifies in my mind that Tom Holland is **the best** Spider-Man. Between Homecoming, Far From Home and Spider-Verse, it’s never been a better time to be a Spider-Man fanatic!",c7xhmz

FFH just checked every boxes: technically great, the story is fantastic, all around acting is great, Tom Holland just embodied Spider-Man, the action scenes are just top tier and only beaten by Avengers movies, and Giacchino's scores are fantastically uplifting.

I mean, other Studios really have to step up their game if they don't want to get demolished by Marvel year after year if FFH is indication of what's coming up next. I really marvel at Marvelstudios' ability to make fresh sequels.

My prediction is this movie will swing past $1 billion.

Thought it was really good that they made a good spiderman movie at the same time a good mcu movie that felt connected with Happy, NickFury, and the Ironman lore of using the BARF technology and disgruntled stark employees. I have a little nitpick that it was too fast and convenient for peter to just give beck the glasses but I guess that just had to happen for the plot and man that 3rd act payoff was definitely worth it. Biggest highlights were definitely the illusion trap with spiderman vs mysterio first. Shit was happening so fast and it was super disorienting but still so cool on how that tech can be really weaponized against someone in a 1v1 combat situation, even that final nick fury shot and then cut to hologram threw me off, damn that was good.

&#x200B;

Then the final action bit with all the drones vs spiderman and the hallway scene was great. They really made a good fight showing peter's science side of stringing all the drones together to disable them and then using the most of spider-man's acrobatics, agility and webshooters. The shield/bomb-hammer thing was a bit cheesy but it was alright. The final use of his spider-sense was badass, even catching that last bullet was awesome.

I LOVE Spidey in the MCU. I loved Mysterio. JJJ is back, and the Simmons in the role! The scene where Spidey uses the full extent of his powers to overcome the illusions at the end, and then also uses them to stop Mysterio from shooting him....aweome.

Now, the bad.

I do not like how Spidey is being positioned as ""Iron Man, Jr."" Not in the tech way, but ""he's filling Iron Man's shoes."" Spidey is Spidey. He's not Iron Man's protege. I have never liked that aspect of the MCU Spidey and I still don't. 

Peter Parker would NEVER give away those glasses to someone he just met. 

I like Holland in the role, but this might be the least Spider-manish Spider-Man of all of the iterations we've seen on film. Enough of the ingenue Spidey. Enough of the HS Peter Parker. Let's get the college-age Spidey/Peter. Where's the sarcastic/joking Spidey? The Spidey that kicks ass and cracks wise while he does it? This insecure, uncertain Spidey is not appealing. 

And while we're at it, I get that the writers may not want to re-hash stuff we've seen in the previous films, but do they have to throw out EVERYTHING from the canonical Spider-Man? All the characters are different, the interactions are not authentic, and I do not really recognize the Spidey world I grew up reading in comics. Aunt May drives a Volvo? Peter is not a photographer at the Bugle? ""MJ"" is Michelle, a smart-ass Puerto Rican girl? There's no Harry at all? I could go on.

I'm conflicted. I want to like this Spidey because FINALLY WE GET MCU SPIDEY!

eudlj1a,"Listen Spiderman was like my childhood thing and I'm still sentimental about it so I have a lot:

* I really like Tom Holland as Spiderman. I think he's great for it.

* On the flipside, I just do not like Zendaya as MJ. I'm not sure if I think she's a bad actress, but she is just so bad at trying to act awkward and ""weird"" and quirky.

* I was worried about it, but I really did find the fights with the elementals to be boring. It feels irrelevant that Spiderman is even.. there for them, and while I get that Mysterio's powers are supposed to be nondescript because *surprise* he doesn't actually have any, it just feels like 2 dudes flying around a blob for 15 minutes while one occasionally shoots gas at it.

* I loved Jake Gyllenhaal, I loved that they used (what I believe are) the actual suits they use to make CGI, I thought that final shot where he's holding the gun looked really cool, but I felt that Mysterio had ""Marvel Villian Syndrome"" where he/she makes one good point but then starts killing and the audience is supposed to go ""oo how morally gray"". I liked his whole thing about how intellectuals and PhD's and genuinely talented people are being completely left on the wayside by society in favor of big guys who can punch really hard with magical powers. I thought it was cool, I thought it was maybe even a meta commentary about the Marvel Movies themselves which are these big dumb powerhouses quickly taking the cultural zeitgeist maybe from other things with a bit more substance (even if I do like them). But then he immediately reveals himself to be a crazy guy who will kill his #1 partner on a dime and murder half of Europe, so I guess that makes him ""morally gray"". It just feels kind of cheap.

* I thought the illusion scenes were good, but I do wish that they removed Peter's suit in his mind in order to give him more of a sense of vulnerability and ground the scenes in his expressions. It just felt a bit weird to watch something that was completely 100% CGI for so long.

* Really liked the scene where the soundtrack cuts out and he's able to sense the drones though.

* I'm not sure if this is a popular or unpopular opinion, but I really don't think Nick Fury or SHIELD is cool. 

I dunno. I think maybe part of it is that I just feel tired of Marvel movies. After End Game it feels like you've just finished a long marathon only to suddenly realize you were on a treadmill the entire time. At some point you have to let things die",c7xhmz

It’s so weird that during the big reveal I was like “Oh come on!” Then I was like meh it kinda reminds me of an Iron Man movie, where misuse of technology and ego comes into play. Like Iron Man 3. For some reason when the characters say “Illusion tech” I’m like alright, works for me. When you see the full use of how it all works, it’s pretty awesome and exciting to see, especially in that trap for Peter before he gets hit by the train. 

Jake Gyllenhaal is the perfect actor for the role, because he has a lot of charm, but is great at playing crazy.

Homecoming left me disappointed, and I was debating if I even wanted to see this but I'm glad I did now I can't wait for the next one.",c7xhmz
esysuds,"- I'd put it a hair above Homecoming because of the post-credits, which included maybe the best in MCU history thus far with JJJ's return 

- Great job by all the actors, especially Gyllenhaal whose performance made Mysterio my favorite MCU villain since Justin Hammer

- Speech in the bar totally reminded me of his Nightcrawler performance, which I loved as well

- I think Mysterio's still alive and used Dimitri/Chameleon as his double to die on the bridge or used some kind of illusion/projection at least

- Film was excellent in little easter egg callbacks to MCU's past while also getting me excited for the future 

**I give Spider-Man: Far From Home a score of 9.5 Night Monkeys outta 10.**",c7xhmz
et3vryk,I kind of feel bad for Uncle Ben. His death was always used as an emotional brace of sorts for Peter but that’s kind of over shadowed by Tony Stark and the other Avengers now lol.,c7xhmz
et4szfw,"Really enjoyed it!  

However...

Anyone else think that Beck’s speech after he got the glasses was the worst part?  Seemed so forced.  I knew we needed to know his plan and I loved the callbacks to the first Iron Man with the characters, but tell us this information in a better way than a monologue.",c7xhmz
et8ih1q,"TLDR :: The film is alright, but the writing throughout is inconsistent and relies too heavily on the Cinematic Universe. 

On mobile and this will be long, so apologies.

I’m a huge fan of Homecoming. I think it’s one of the best MCU films for its great humor, brilliant connections to the cinematic universe, and excellent character driven story telling. To say the least, I was very excited for Far From Home. The humor in this movie is hit or miss and felt like several jokes could have been cut. For example, the teacher taking a selfie with a 35mm camera isn’t necessary and we all saw the joke coming from a mile away but one of the jokes that had me cracking up was him talking about his wife faking being blipped. There are some great jokes but to many are obvious and fall flat which is a problem when so much of the film relies on the dialogue carrying most of the film. It’s biggest crime in the humor department is that it wastes J.B. Smoove. How can you waste J.B. Smoove? He has a few moments but most of it didn’t even connect with other people in the audience. 

The entire MacGuffin of the movie really felt weak for me because I don’t believe Tony would have left Peter (or anyone) an army of flying drones that fire on targets without confirming them as a target. The last time we saw Tony in the universe, he was retired and living his family life so either
A) he built all of this before retiring and for some reason didn’t use it when Thanos was going to wipe out all life or
B) he had it built after he was gone and left it in the hands of others to hopefully get it to Peter or
C) he built it while he was retired and never used them?
Everything we learned about Tony leads me to believe he wouldn’t build such a powerful weapon because it’s very existence could always put innocent people at risk no matter who had control of it. That was his arch from the very first movie so to have him leave behind the ultimate weapon feels so out of place for his character.

The scene on the bus when EDITH targets Brad felt so out of place. I’m alright with Peter doing something’s in front of his classmates without them noticing but there has to be limits. Peter should have been able to tell EDITH to abort instead of jumping out of the bus, destroying it, AND landing without anyone on the bus noticing. What he did in Infinity War was perfect, everyone was looking out the back of the bus when he left out the fire escape. I just can’t believe that no one noticed anything happening when they were looking out of the window. Another scene that felt out of place was his fight against the water “elemental”. The whole movie, Peter is adamant that he live a normal life and is trying separate his life from Spider-Man’s life and that he wanted to be his own hero and not have to step into the life of Iron Man. I liked that he didn’t bring his suit because I thought it would force him to be Peter Parker and play down his Spidey powers in-front of his peers in a grounded and realistic way. It would have been a great to see Peter in a Spider-Man moment and having to sacrifice Spider-Mans heroics for the sake of saving his friends but instead he uses his web-shooters and risks all of the people he is closest to discovering he is Spider-Man. The movie had him saying he wanted to live his normal life and be the hero he needed to be, but that action is the exact opposite of exactly what he has been saying.

This brings me to my next point: he becomes Iron Man. The whole movie felt like it was about Spidey becoming the hero HE needed to be so that he wouldn’t be compared to Iron Man. He kept refusing to help Fury because he wanted to have a life where he could be the hero he felt he was supposed to be, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, not save the world hero like Iron Man. It felt completely out of place then when we see him being Tony by building a new suit and listening to AC/DC (I mean Led Zeppelin). His pep talk even comes from Happy and not Aunt May who would have been perfect because she knows he is Spidey. It felt so out of place to have this scene because it felt like the type of thing the series wouldn’t want to do after Iron Mans death. 

Now comes Mysterio. I think for the most part he is done terrifically. He is played perfectly by Jake and he has some of the best scenes in the movie. I liked the cute nod to Civil War and Iron Man but it’s incredibly annoying that AGAIN the villain worked with and was disrespected by a rich billionaire makes him want revenge, just like IM2, IM3, AM and AMATW. All of those films have the weakest villains and I thought the MCU would be past characters like this. My largest problem is I don’t feel stakes because I don’t know what his plan is beyond tricking London into thinking he is a hero. It’s hard for me to believe that he thought his plan would even work after Tony saved ALL LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE when all Mysterio would be recognized for is saving London in another world ending event. His character wasn’t bad, but I expected the writers to be able to elevate him beyond wanting to be seen as a hero like they did with Vultures character from Homecoming. The power that would come with Starks drones is a starter, but I don’t understand how he planned to use them once he got them. For financial gain? For power over the world? To start a war? If someone has the answer I would love to hear it. Another issue I have is that he said that he could have changed the world with his Illusion technology but we are never told why he thinks this. I thought the MCU’s villains would be given more thought from now on but that doesn’t appear to be the case. 

The movie relies on the MCU too much. It relies on the callbacks during Mysterios reveal to hide the fact that it was a huge exposition dump. It relies on Tony too much when the villains purpose, objective, and tools come from Tony Stark. It relies too heavily on having callbacks to Tony for Peters scene when he pulls himself back up to save the day. It relies on the MCU too much when we see Spidey use a shield and hammer as a callback Endgame. It relies on the MCU too much when it has Happy Hogan helping push Peter instead of Aunt May. 

I could keep on going but I feel these points best incapsulate my problems with the movie. Im going to see it again in the hopes in can change my mind because I still had a good time watching it, I just don’t think it is a great movie.",c7xhmz
ettplxb,Why didn't Tony use these attack drones in the fight against Thanos? I felt like the movie was mediocre and the final fight being against drones wasn't all that satisfying. I wish they still had him fight Mysterio with the projections instead of the drones. The illusions were really well done though and the bit where Happy plays the music from the Iron Man movies was really cool.,c7xhmz
est39z7,"The raves for this are a little surprising. As much as I loved Gyllenhaal, I found the action sequences a little repetitive with the elemental monsters and the drones. It doesn’t quite make sense how Spider-Man would have interacted with them during the fight. If he accidentally webbed any of the drones it would have destroyed the illusion as one fell to earth.

The tone was all over the place and Parker basically becomes Stark after spending a few minutes modding a suit. I just didn’t buy the emotional beats other than the high school drama. As much as Homecoming felt a little bland, I enjoyed how grounded it was.

Let the downvotes rain down.",c7xhmz
esnqnw3,"Holy shit. That was fucking amazing. I usually don't watch movies twice no matter how good it is but this is very tempting, specially that illusion scene. It looked like an acid trip, and the amount of twists is insane. Even the mid-credit and post-credit scene was a fucking bomb.",c7xhmz
etk0btu,A couple notes: I hate edgy MJ. Like at times she's cool but I'm done with all the edgy comments constantly.

esp6shu,J Jonah Jameson must and should be the key to bring back Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire in the MCU.,c7xhmz
esms8o2,"Surprised so many people seem to have enjoyed it this much. I thought it was barely okay, gave it a 6. I think I actually prefer homecoming, despite that also ranking low in the MCU for me.

* I liked Mysterio a lot of course. I did not like that he was supposed to have a good motive but it is instantly clear he doesn't. I thought the MCU was past boring ""bad for the sake of being bad"" villains. Also, he never checks to see if Spider-man is dead. 

* The elemental were pretty boring tbh, glad they weren't the real threat. 

* If Edith did not require Mysterio to hand over access, then why couldn't Spider-man just yell to revoke his permits? 

* I feel like they missed a lot of opportunities. I was interested in seeing how Peter has changed and how he misses Tony but they skip that. He should have revealed his identity himself, showing actual growth and taking on the responsibility.

* Overall, this felt like a pre-MCU superhero film. Still liked it but don't think I will rewatch for a long time.",c7xhmz
eswn9sp,"This is going to be quite critical, but I really did enjoy the movie. Everyone has already discussed most the stuff I liked though so I'd rather go into the issues I had with the film.

On paper I love what the MCU is doing with Spider-Man. Starting him in high school in a world where superheroes dominate and showing his coming of age story right where it began. It makes perfect sense. However, Homecoming for me left a lot to be desired e.g. supporting character changes, uncle Ben pretty much being sidelined and far too much focus on Iron Man Jr instead of Spider-Man. Unfortunately Far From Home also left a lot to be desired, and I feel overall the movie was far weaker than Homecoming so it's flaws stick out more.

The teenage drama had stuff I loved and hated. The scene of Peter wanting to sit next to MJ and that not going his way is all sorts of relateable. I loved seeing MJ open herself up to Peter and then put on her act when Ned is there, it makes her jarring behaviour in Homecoming make more sense (she felt reshot into every scene she was in, like you could cut her out of the movie and nothing would have changed) and their kiss scene was cute. I really hope Zendaya gets to be more charismatic with MJ coming out of her shell because she can offer so much more for the character and truly become ""MJ"". I do think it's a shame we never saw the start of their attraction for one another though(I get the movie starts 8 months after Endgame so it can happen off screen, but to me it's boring going from attraction straight away and ending up together, I want more blossoming romance, will they won't they etc). 

The whole Ned/Betty thing was just an absolute waste of screentime and didn't feel realistic at all both in a character sense and in a ""there is no way he would get her"" sense, no offence. Brad as a character was needless competition for MJ and that scene where he tells Peter he has to show her the photo because he liked her too had my eyes rolling as being needlessly one dimensional. I worry about where they're going with Flash, it makes me think they're setting him up as some Harry Osborne replacement and I really hope that's not the case. I also think in terms of teen drama Far From Home has the exact same problem as Homecoming: lack of consequence. Peter decides to do Spider-Man stuff instead of spending time with Liz/MJ and yet he still gets the girl to go to prom/kiss him. His decisions to be Spider-Man should be distancing himself from his friends, not having nothing change. It would have been horrible if Peter's decision to be Spider-Man at one point led to MJ and Brad talking and her moving on from him, even if she still liked him. Good stuff to then explore in sequels after a bit of build up.

The main story is where I had most of my issues. On paper it's a really good story, but it wasn't developed well at all. Firstly I just can't believe that after Project Insight and Ultron that Tony would make EDITH, it doesn't make sense. I also can't believe he would give this sort of power to Peter, especially without any sort of Training Wheels Protocol. Peter handing EDITH over to Mysterio was just absolute bullshit only done to let the plot happen, they had like 3 scenes together before this. I don't care if Peter is 16, that really is not an excuse when we know how clever and experienced he is. This isn't the sort of mistake I can see him making. I also just cannot believe how much they brushed aside everything to do with Aunt May. So you're telling me we go from her panicking about Peter missing during the ferry incident in Homecoming and now suddenly she's okay with Spider-Man? Where's the necessary fucking development in between these two extremes? Just such a waste when this should be an incredibly emotional and important moment. Also great to see her shagging Happy without any sort of care in the world for uncle Ben. I'm fine with it, I just want that development, that talk, just anything that references uncle Ben besides a quick shot of a briefcase. Literally the biggest plot point from Homecoming (May finding out) reduced to absolutely nothing, not even a discussion about it. Not sure what to call it really. Lazy, inconsequential, boring. 

This movie was completely carried by Jake Gyllenhaal, who was annoyingly wasted in the first half of the movie. When he finally got to be Mysterio though holy shit, fantastic. The score was wonderful for him too. The action set piece versus Spider-Man is hands down one of the best fight scenes in any Spider-Man movie and is pretty much the only part of the movie I had absolutely no problem with whatsoever. It's some really great stuff with some wonderful comic book cover shots, especially that one of the ""snow globe"" helmet at the end of the sequence. 

I have no opinion towards the credit scenes. I'm happy to have JK Simmons back but that cliffhanger is obviously going to be wrapped up without consequences, just like the snap brought people back and then nothing changed. I'll happily be surprised if this does actually change things going forward. The Skrull stuff is hard to judge it's importance right now. Fury in space, okay cool. Not much to really say on that otherwise.

To be honest I'm really looking forward for the next trilogy, presuming they plan on carrying on Peter Parker Spider-Man movies (and why wouldn't they?) so he's in college. I hope Jon Watts completes his trilogy and then we get someone else in charge, and a ""reboot"" occurs. I don't obviously mean continuity wise, but Watts has his Hughes inspired high school movies and I'd like a tonal shift to occur with the change to college. I also think it's the perfect opportunity for them to make a more classic Spider-Man e.g. he befriends Harry and Gwen (Ned leaves to go to a different college), MJ becomes more confident and maybe ends up becoming a model, uncle Ben is brought into the story somehow with Peter having closure on his Iron Man obsession etc.

Spider-Man: Far From Home feels like a movie with a lot of great ideas but the way they came together and were executed left a lot to be desired. I think it had potential to be one of the MCU's best but ultimately it falls short in ways Homecoming didn't, if only because of the nature of a story that leads to a lot of different locations rather than one focused place. The best way I could describe Far From Home is Homecoming but with better action and an underdeveloped story. More of the same, some stuff better than others and some stuff not as good.",c7xhmz

I want to see the worlds reaction to the new villainous Spider-Man. Imagine Flash watching the news and at first thinking Mysterio is full of shit and then finding out Parker is Spider-Man. Imagine Aunt May finding out and feeling guilty because she sent him there in the first place.

&#x200B;

I hope the mid-credits scene comes to absolutely nothing.  It would take so little to completely discredit Mysterio, and Peter should have a whole team backing him.  I can understand how JJJ would maintain his criticism in the comics, but the dynamics in the cinematic universe are different.  The Avengers know how much Peter meant to Tony and they probably know Peter was the reason behind Tony's participation in the time heist.  It'd almost feel like an insult to Tony's memory if the Avengers didn't check in on Peter periodically and in this situation, come to his defense.",c7xhmz

Still, I wanted to believe Beck was telling the truth up until the reveal, but I kind of expected this.

I think Mysterio and Vulture have been some of the most interesting Marvel villains thus far. Just a few questions:

I kind of had a blink and you miss it moment with Mysterio and Peter on the bridge. What bullet hit him? Was it from a drone? For a second there I thought Peter ""killed"" him.

Is Mysterio still alive? Did he record that post-credits scene before his death and the confrontation on the bridge? After it?

Still not crazy about this MJ’s personality, maybe now that feelings are in the open that will change, but the edginess, I’m not even sure that’s the word I’m looking for, gets old real quick.

I do wish they had explored the Blip some more. Nothing that would seriously depress the tone of the film, but more stuff sprinkled throughout the movie referencing its effects would have been welcome. (Loved Gilfoyle's wife pretending to be snapped!) Not sure the name ""Blip"" works either, especially if other films are going to try to maintain the tragedy of the event which they definitely will. Those five chaotic years are the perfect way to set up origin stories for random heroes/villains in the next phase. The general audience is already familiar with it as the 'Snap'.

Also felt the last act was a little weaker than the first two. The Mysterio illusion trap sequence was *stellar* \- right out of the comic books, but I was not a fan of the London part.

Finally, I think they're pushing the character of Spiderman too far into Iron Man territory. There were times you could almost forget you were watching Spiderman. I really hope the third movie focuses on getting the character back to the root of his power set. Maybe ditch the Stark tech.

I know a lot of people didn't like the teenage romance subplot, but I thought it worked. Hope Happy becomes Pete's new step-uncle! Every scene between the two of them was great. >!AND THEY BROUGHT BACK JK!!<

I also like how the MCU Spider-Man films are just so much more light in tone compared to the previous efforts. They’re just so much fun while still being really emotional (but not too emotional that we spend more time watching Peter be depressed and hating his life while people close to him keep dying).

There was so many interesting concepts explained in the movie 


I like how the world has ptsd post blip and they're struggling to have anyone to believe in after Tony died, cap left, and widow died too

I like how mysterio paints himself like an antihero to Peter based on dialogue the writer he has creates, and the whole people need something to believe in metaphor, I thought for a moment they were going to give mysterio the two face dark Knight treatment where he would be preserved as good because they needed someone to believe in


They did that in a better and more fun way with the end stuff and mid credits

Making it so that quentin fake news's Peter and reveals his identity and the whole massive world changing point of turning the daily bugle into an right wing info wars journo type website WITH JK SIMMONS REPRISING HIS ROLE was perfect. Absolutely pitch perfect and I hope they formally get him back


There's lot of topics covered in the film that touches on many current day topics. Even the use of drones again as well.

I love how Peter is hunted by everyone and it does feel like an iron man 1 rebirth for Peter along with the identity reveal as well.

I really hope that Sony do another deal with marvel to keep Tom Holland and spidey  but Amy pascal has gone to Warner and they don't have anyone in the Sony side to sort of collaborate together with.

They even had the allusion in the film. Happy says that spidey will call fury not the other way round, its kind of a subtle push for Sony to try and get on board again.

I hope they do. They also totally rehabilitated mj which I liked. I didn't like zendayas antifa style portrayal in the first one but this one was great and she became much more of a love interest to Peter which was great. 


Honestly there are such a lot of layers of excellent dialogue to this movie to peel back. Jake gyllenhaal as per usual absolutely knocked it out the park I loved his good guy mysterio and then his might crawler style turn was perfect. 


There was a lot about fake news in this. 

And that's not even to mention he amazing psychology horror mysterio puts Peter through fighting himself, fighting the half decayed iron man shell corpse of Tony, getting hit by a bullet train, all the psychology elements were so good as well as the fakeouts with quentin 


It was all just so so good. 

Am confused by end credits thought it was the ship from captain marvel but some big blog like vf or something says its not the same ship that furys in. 

I hope they have the kid from iron man 3 take over as ironman, they even have him in the funeral scene.

This feels like the start of season 2 of the MCU. Since 22 episodes is pretty standard in TV for a season and there's 22 MCU movies through to Endgame, this was definitely Season 2 Episode 1 of that structure.  
  
Nothing in the movie involved Thanos or the Infinity Stones. There was a line in the trailer unused in the movie that mentioned the Snap causing a multiverse.

Also loved the Captain America End Game reference

et1neba,"I'm surprised that so many people don't like the High School stuff.  One of my issues of Homecoming was that it didn't lean enough into that, but this time it was a lot more in the forefront and I really enjoyed it. The Ned/Betty thing is cheesy, but I thought that it was funny enough not to really drag or feel unintentionally stupid.  It actually felt like Peter had to balance his social/superhero life, which wasn't all that present in Homecoming, and is something I was hoping to see more of in the future.

I didn't like the opening, didn't add a single thing to the movie and hurt the initial pacing.

I thought the final talk with Mysterio was oddly edited and rushed in a weird way, though I was more than happy with how he was used in the film, and is probably my favorite villain in the MCU.

I thought the movie was quite funny, and never relied on quips like most other Marvel films(I can't stand when a quip undercuts a dramatic situation). I can only think one time where it felt like it stopped the scene in its tracks.

CGI is still bad on Spidey though.

The reason I’m confused is because in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Peter’s suit records every single that Peter does under the “Training Wheels Protocol”, but in Far From Home, even if it is a new suit, although the previous suit did have Karen, and this one did not, wouldn’t the full end encounter or “Boss Battle” with Mysterio be captured? Which would allow Spider-Man to show the world that he was actually innocent? Unless he didn’t have it set to record, because he did build the suit. Anyone else confused or is it just me?

Surely Beck would have a contingency plan regarding the glasses in case Spider Man came for him. Maybe his death could've been another grand illusion. Either the movie really sets up for a very good 3rd part. I could definitely say this is the best Spider Man movie we've seen so far.

The first act felt like it was going to be a Europe-themed teen shenanigans movie with a Spider Man plot in it. But I'm glad it got going soon enough.

The twist that >!Mysterio was just a guy with some illusions made by drones!< was pretty clever, reminded me of >!Iron Man 3's twist with a bit more complexity.!< The sequence where Peter ""hallucinates"" and sees his worst fears, including >!Zombie Iron Man!< was very well done, reminded me of Scarecrow. Jake Gyllenhaal played his character perfectly, as both a mysterious hero from a parallel Earth and >!A guy who's gone mad with power and wants to become the ultimate hero by defeating fake monsters, a la Syndrome from The Incredibles!< A couple of scenes felt a bit contrived for the situation or for comedy, but it still overall worked in terms of story structure. And of course both credits scenes were hilarious, especially the mid-credit scene. It was nice to finally see >!JK Simmons as JJJ again, and have him be a parody of Alex Jones. A perfect ""modernization"" in my opinion!< And of course I liked seeing >!Talos and Soren!< again with that neat post-credits scene, mostly because I just like seeing >!Ben Mendelssohn as the good guy for once!<.

Overall I throughly enjoyed it, was a good balance of funny, clever, and action-y without ever feeling like a retread of Homecoming, and nothing ever being too predictable.

espjbv8,"This was the first MCU film where I properly started to feel the fatigue set in.

The film was fine. Kept me mostly entertained and full of fun action sequences and character moments. But it just felt like such an empty experience.

Mysterio's illusions seem like the perfect metaphor for how I feel right now about superhero films, especially in the MCU. At first, you're distracted by the bright, showy attractions on the exterior. But now I can't help but only see the machinery within, all the story beats, all the conventions and the formulas. Nothing compelling or emotionally engaging. All style, no substance.",c7xhmz
et8llq4,"Unpopular as hell opinion but this was disappointing as fuck. Loved Homecoming but this just pails in comparison in almost every way 

Jake G’s Mysterio was a huge disappointment. Way, way, WAY too campy and not menacing enough.  The cool illusion sequences came way too late in the film. His character was also underdeveloped as hell, and we didn’t get to know him at all before the twist came so it wasn’t much of a shocker.

Michael Keaton’s vulture was just far superior. The humor in that movie was also much better. The plot felt more grounded and human, I couldn’t get emotionally invested in this movie at all. 

Honestly as someone who loves practically all Phase 3 marvel films, this disappointed me. Was expecting more. Hopefully Black Widow breaks the marvel envelope a bit more than this did.

esoe32b,"So after Homecoming came out I did a pretty big analysis on the theme of the dynamics between Peter Parker and Spider-man.  If you're interested you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6lu64f/the_official_spiderman_homecoming_discussion/djwrh57/), but basically the idea was that in that movie, Peter was basically ready to give up his own life to *be* Spider-man, and a big thing Tony was trying to get through to him that if there is no Peter, there is no value to Spider-man.  You need something to fight for.

So now what's interesting about Far From Home is we are literally seeing the opposite story-line now.  While Peter isn't looking to get rid of Spider-man, like we saw in Raimi's Spider-man 2, he is definitely looking to make his personal life a stronger fixture, to the point of wanting to limit Spider-man's role.  

A big aspect of that is MJ.  In Homecoming we had his crush Liz.  While it was clear he had feelings for her, until Stark took away his suit, Peter put Spider-man before Liz anytime he had to make a choice.  

In this movie, he put his plans with MJ before his role as Spider-man.  We can see this in multiple instances, such as not packing the suit, turning down the mission from Fury, handing the glasses to Beck. 

So what are we supposed to get from this?  A few things.  First off, Peter cares more for MJ than he did for Liz.  He is definitely making a greater effort to separate Spider-man from interfering with his life too much now.  With where Peter was in Homecoming, it wouldn't have even been a concern to preserve the santity of his trip, or, more specifically, his plans to confess his feelings to MJ.  In this film, we can see how truly important his own life has become to him.

More importantly though, Peter failed in each of his attempts to push Spider-man aside.  Everyone around him refused to let him keep Spider-man separate.  Aunt May foils him by packing his suit, Fury hijacks the trip, and when it comes time to tell MJ how he feels, she moves the discussion to Spider-man himself.  In every case, the people around him force him to be Spider-man when he's trying to be Peter, even MJ.

And then of course he was foiled once again by Beck, who took the glasses. 

So what is this all trying to tell us?  How does this fit in with the themes in Homecoming?  

The answer is, there is no such thing as the ""Friendly-Neighbourhood"" Spider-man.  In the first movie Peter was trying to shed himself of the Peter identity in order to be Spider-man.  He learned that wasn't the right move, so he figured the best way to balance them is to limit Spider-man to a small-time deal.  But that wasn't actually what Stark intended as the lesson, he wanted Peter to learn to be Peter and Avenger's Spider-man.  Peter felt like he couldn't handle that.

But he doesn't have a choice.  Friendly-Neighbourhood Spider-man simply isn't an option.  Spider-man isn't something that can be contained or brushed aside.  If he is going to find that balance between his identities, he has to figure out how to do it with a full-blown Avengers Spider-man.  

When he tries to keep Spider-man small time, that results in him brushing aside major decisions, like what to do with EDITH.  But in doing so, he is always going to end up hurting those he is trying to get close to.  Beck summarizes this nicely when he says something along the lines of ""It's so easy to fool those who are already fooling themselves"" (I don't remember the actual quote, but it was SOMETHING along those lines).  Basically, he recognized that Peter was in denial about the signifiance of Spider-man, that he felt that Spider-man *could* be contained.  

Now, there were some far less subtle nods to this theme, such as the whole movie being about Peter being pushed to fill Stark's shoes, and the incredibly not subtle theme of Spider-man going ""international"", you know, outside the ""neighbourhood"". 

In summary, while the first movie was about the *need* for a private life and a proper balance between being Peter and being Spider-man, this movie's focus was on *how* to go about that.  Specifically, the answer *not* being by limited Spider-man because that can't be done.  When he is Spider-man, he needs to take that role on with the seriousness it deserves.   So if keeping Spider-man small time isn't the way to do it, then what is?  Well, the movie doesn't really answer that question, and based on the after-credits scene, I suspect this is going to be a continued exploration for the character.  However, considering that the people in his life (May, Fury, Happy, MJ) were all people who shifted his focus to Spider-man when he was getting distracted, I think it's pretty clear that a big part of it will be making use of the people in his life to help ground him in both Peter Parker and Spider-man.",c7xhmz

et0s7ls,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't love it. There was nothing that really grabbed me. I'm trying to figure out why.

My favorite part...probably when MJ first kissed Peter. I'm a guy that refuses to watch romantic comedies, loves plot-dead movies with kung fu and laser-shooting robots. Yeah, and I think that was still my favorite moment because it was the most heartfelt and meaningful bit of the whole movie. I also liked the Happy pep-talk leading up to Peter echoing Stark as he designs his new suit. That scene could have been too sappy or over the top, but I think it worked out nicely.

I also loved the actors. Top-notch all around.

One issue is that nothing felt fresh. We've seen so many comic book movies by now, done the whole Endgame thing, watched Spidey go all Instant Kill versus space aliens. The pizzazz was missing.

Maybe, more importantly, it didn't seem like Peter progressed that much, personally (other than MJ), or as a superhero. I get it's kind of unfair that Spiderman has to shoulder the weight (of moviegoer expectations) after Endgame, but...yeah. Those are definitely some big shoes to fill, and I don't think it quite made it.

Take the illusion scenes. They were quite well done, but honestly, I was bored halfway through them. I *knew* they were just illusions (as should have Peter), so I didn't care as much. Plus, we've seen so many amazing special effects in movies, another snazzy sequence doesn't quite do it on its own. I feel bad saying this, because there are undoubtedly some underpaid, overworked effects artists who put everything into those gorgeous scenes, but storywise, I had little interest.

The best counterexample I can give is in Ragnorak when Thor arrives on the bridge. That scene stuck with me, the one from the trailers where Hela asks, ""What were you the god of?"" and then Thor does his superhero landing in a streak of lightning. He proceeds to kick the ass out of the bad guys.

CG-wise, that scene was likely less expensive (I think), but it was so majorly badass. It wasn't just the cinematography, but the moment was a such a confirmation and redemption of Thor's identity. He lost his powers, his people, his father, his hammer, and that one iconic moment was such a THIS-IS-WHO-I-AM-MOTHERFUCKERS moment, taking back his birthright.

I wasn't cheering the special effects. I was cheering a broken man who fought back and won. The special effects were all thematically in line with this. Everything aligned.

With Far From Home, we've had such awesome visual moments in the MCU already, along with plenty of Spidey fan service. The action, the special effects -- they just didn't have the same punch for me in the context of all that without stronger emotional support. The Peter issues were just meh. There was no visual illustration of Peter triumphing in the same way Thor had. The gun thing at the end was perhaps the closest, but the theme/imagery were no where near as powerful. The alignment was a lot weaker.

I've always thought sequels are tough. One way to make them work is to keep ramping things up. New powers, greater stakes, more deaths, and so on. The other way is to keep things the same, like sitcoms do. We just want to watch Spidey chill with his friends, beat up bad guys while cracking jokes, and pull some slick swinging moves. I think that's why I enjoyed the MJ (and Ned) stuff the most, because there was no way FFH was going to beat Endgame in terms of novelty or increasing stakes.

The more I think about this, the more I'm realizing what a difficult job the director and writers had. How the hell are you supposed to finish off Phase 3 after Endgame? All things considered, they did a great job with a perhaps impossible task.

In any case, I'll be looking forward to the next one!",c7xhmz

et3foui,"Seriously, WOW!  Well done, seriously. They really gave you the goods after ""Endgame"" and kudos to Jon Watts. His take on Spider-Man, visually and the story with his writers and how it treats it's villains within the MCU is well done. I feel like after The Russos with Cap America and Favreau with the first Iron Man, he's the best director/superhero pairing.  

The Berlin/Mysterio sequence might be my favorite sequence in the MCU. Well done!  

I was a little bit nervous when I saw Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to play Mysterio but man he really brought it just like Michael Keaton in ""Homecoming"". These aren't just megalomaniac I wanna rule the world with my great power or strength. These are smart, clever I just want what I want villains.

etdurac,"I really liked this movie, probably my second favorite Spider Man movie after spiderverse. But I have one issue. It's not so much a nitpick as it is a problem I have with Iron Man. I didn't like EDITH. I don't like the fact the Stark put a satellite in the sky that can spy on anyone and launch surgical strikes anywhere.

To be clear, I don't think it's a plot hole. This sounds like something Stark would do, especially after Thanos attacking Earth, but I just think it's a really unethical thing to do. It kind of really sours my opinion of the character. It almost makes me wish the movie called more attention to how shitty it was for Stark to build this. Like Beck could have a throwaway line to Parker like ""you think I'm the villain? Who do you think built all of this?"".

Other than that though, I really liked all the Spider-Man stuff. We've never gotten to see Peter Parker go on vacation. It's a new spin on the character. I thought the action set pieces were much better than Homecoming. In general I thought it was a good movie",c7xhmz

I see people speculating whether or not Quentin survived being shot or not but what if he never even got shot in the first place? What if the entire battle including winning was part of the plan? I think that Quentin was never even there to begin with and that the fight was solely for the purpose of framing Spider-Man. Why couldn't the hologram technology be used to fake Quentin being there?

3. Bar scene replaced with Beck have a big smerk. Leaving audience like creeped out that he has just been given Eidith and he must be a creep with a vilain grin like that. 

Leaving the audience with that lingering thought for 5-10 minutes instead of instant reveal would be great. You know something must be up, but don't know the details. Only learning them along with Peter.

etrzyi7,"One of the weaker Marvel movies and we're starting to see the late stage limitations of that bigger universe forcing a movie that could have had so much potential into a box.  
  
- Disappointing direction to watch Peter spend the movie trying to prove to Fury he can be the next Iron Man when his whole arc in Homecoming was proving to Tony that he could be his own hero  
- Villain (while fun) had flimsy motivations (""Sins of Stark"") that have been done to fucking death in prior Marvel movies (Vanko, Killian, Vulture in the last movie ffs)  
- Side characters have zero development. Ned is just a running joke. MJ gets nothing. I can tell you nothing new about either of those characters. Flash Thompson gets more development than either of those two and that should not be the case.  
- Finale was an underwhelming drone army beatdown that not only pales compared to the awesome illusion sequence earlier but is reminiscent of something you've again seen too many times in *Iron Man 2*, *Age of Ultron*, and even *Venom*. Robot army is unimaginative and is more flip-flopping on the Stark Weapons legacy plot that Marvel keeps flipping back and forth on. 
- Brad sideplot comes out of nowhere, is resolved quickly but still dragged out, and feels downright uncomfortable/creepy. Is this really the best that larger five year skip decision has to offer?

esn43yt,"I love marvel. I've watched every single one in theaters. I'd say this is the first time I've been disappointed. Maybe the bar's been set to high. This was merely a serviceable movie. It's very funny and the action is decent. The villain plot felt contrived to me even though he has a cool gimmick. But that's just Mysterio being inherently cool. On a technical level this movie just felt sloppy to me. The cutting of scenes felt jarring in certain parts. The soundtrack was wholly forgettable, although this has been a problem with marvel for some time. Their only memorable theme has been the Avengers one. I don't know why they don't use the Sony spiderman theme. This movie was produced by Sony right? It's not great when I legitimately think the best parts of the movie are the opening (in memorium) and the mid credits scenes.

My biggest issue was that in a movie that was supposed to deal directly with the aftermath of endgame there was barely any emotional bite to it. The whole taking over the mantle from Tony thing feels unearned and wasn't explored well. Can someone pls explain why Tony felt it was a good idea to hand over a weapon this powerful to a 16 year old? I'm gonna put aside the fact that he even thought building something like this was a good idea after Ultron, and even after he argued for more oversight on heroes in Civil War. He must have had this contingency planned before they set off to retrieve the stones in endgame, possibly even as far back as civil war. There were plenty of other heroes he could've passed this to. War Machine? Black Widow? Black Panther? Pepper Potts, his own damn wife? And I know he was mad with Cap, but he must have known that Cap is literally the perfect person to entrust something like this to. Also Iron Man is the saviour of Earth but it's not as if that's his official designation. Why is there even a need for someone to 'take over'? As Peter pointed out himself, Dr Strange exists. Cap Marvel exists. It is literally their job to safeguard the galaxy. While Carol has other responsibilities, Strange is based on Earth and he's far more powerful than Iron Man ever was or could ever be. What he was doing during this movie is something I hope is explained but I doubt ever will be.",c7xhmz

estp0k4,"Good movie but not nearly as good as the hype or reviews. Really feel like Disney marvel movies are given benefit of doubt more than any other franchise I’ve ever seen. Their villains are usually one dimensional or bland & the writing is usually average at best. 

For example, one of the worst scenes in the movie & perhaps entire marvel slate was when the Mysterio twist happens. He literally monologues in the bar & explains point by point each disgruntled worker & their motivations, etc. Any writer will tell you that is an extremely lazy way to describe the plot but it’s something they do al the time. I hated that scene so much bc it’s so unrealistic, forced, & cheesy. 

Action was decent tho hated how they turned Mysterio into basically just an evil producer. Think they ruined his character similar to how they ruined the Mandarin (tho not quite as bad). Would’ve loved if Mysterio remained in his first half of movie form and then just turns bad or something. 

Way too much time spent with frivolous side character stuff with the class & school. 

Overall doesn’t come close to any of the better comic book movies. It was decent & a good time overall but nothing special (many other Spider-Man movies are much better imo).",c7xhmz

etaydvo,"My thoughts in no particular order:

- Did the beginning of the movie make anyone else think they were in the wrong movie? I suddenly got worried but was received when I saw Fury and Hill.

- It was great to see the school newscasters again. Getty Images KILLED me.

- Was a little confused as to why Peter was so awkward during the press conference at the beginning rather than his usual quippy self. Was there any reason, or was it just from losing Tony?

- Both of the teachers were hilarious. Also, fuck Brad.

- I loved MJ in this movie. She actually seemed like an interesting character and sensible love interest for Peter, other than someone who was there just for the sake of being a girl that Peter liked or a damsel in distress like in earlier versions. I was a little worried after Liz in Homecoming, but they nailed it with MJ.

- I seem to be in the minority that doesn't like how ham-fisted the efforts to make Peter the next Iron Man. There's an important distinction between following in Tony's footsteps and being the next Tony, and I felt the movie did too much of the latter while ignoring the fact that Peter and Tony are actually very different people aside from their tech genius. Peter is the next hero, not the next Iron Man.

- A little weary about Peter being able to call in drone strikes anywhere, anytime. 

- The Mysterio twist was handled superbly IMO. The gradual change in motif, music, and ambience perfectly fit the scene. I can only imagine how I would have felt with no knowledge of the character (curse my excited self reading too many hype threads in this sub).

- I loved the stakes in this movie. I wanted something bigger than Homecoming but smaller than Avengers, and Mysterio fit the bill perfectly. I was disappointed about the lack of any ""friendly neighborhood"" stuff at the beginning (even just a quick crime bust would have been nice), which is the only thing that keeps this movie right behind Homecoming in my rankings.

- Flash's neglect by his parents felt too random to just be for a small amount of sympathy. I'll be surprised if it's not foreshadowing anything in the next movie (cough cough Osborn?) 

- I yelled when I saw J.K. Simmons in the mid-credit scene. I hope we get to see him again in the next Spidey movie.

And now the movie gap begins. Can't wait for February...",c7xhmz

If the multiverse were really happening, then Beck would have referred to the MCU as the correct Earth number (Earth-199999), but instead, he referred to it as Earth-616 (the Earth number of the main Marvel comic continuity).

If he was able to scan through the multiverse like he claimed, then he would have known the correct reality number.

The sad part is that i REALLY LOVED the ""YOU GUNNA DIE LITTLE SPIDER "" part , but it felt so incoherent with the rest of the movie. I mean they tried to give a deep character to Mysterio, only to make him go crazy near the end, again in a matter of second. The toast scene with all the others former Stark employees was the turning point. And imho it was badly written, wasting Jake talent with a lousy script.",c7xhmz
esk90fc,"7/10, not bad but I liked Homecoming a lot more. 

- really like how they handled Mysterio’s illusions. The drones and use of previously seen technology was a very clever explanation, and a lot more believable than I thought it was going to be. That trippy scene in the middle was also great.
- apart from that, Mysterio was ok, not as good as Vulture but certainly not the worst villain we’ve seen. 
- none of the emotional moments really resonated with me. There wasn’t a strong sense of consequence to the whole ‘wanting to be a normal kid’ theme that, IMO, was done a lot better in the Raimi films. Most of the stakes were presented comically, which was rather disappointing and a bit predictable with these films.
- they get a sneaky pass for the special effects because half of it was literally supposed to be fake in the context of the film. 
- Jameson was great, though I wish he had his iconic haircut.

Probably my least favourite MCU villian so far, and thats saying something considering I can't even recall the name of the bad guy in Iron Man 3.

esotdk9,"Homecoming was one of my favourite marvel movie, this one was a letdown. I didn't even have high expectations because the concept of spiderman around Europe seemed limited to me. 

I found the first part incredibly mediocre. It was forced Marvel humour non stop. Not even 1/3 of the jokes landed either with me or the cinema audience. They also threw the writing out of the window for more than 1 hour. Seriously, Peter with no costume jumping out of the bus and nobody noticing because they were looking at goats, wtf?! 

They also recycled Peter's character act from the first movie and just replaced Tony by Happy... Peter even though being still a teenager was a better Spiderman than the one seen in the movie. He was all about accepting responsibility and not avoiding them childishly.

The second part was way better. Mysterio's twist was obvious to anyone that knows the character but it was well executed. Mysterio was a success as a whole. In my mind that's exactly how you modernize him. The illusion action scenes were also top notch. 

As always the acting was great. Romance between Peter and MJ was fine when they were not trying to make it too funny. And of course the post credit scene were great. Happy to see that they're going for a post civil war situation with Spidey, that way they won't be able to recycle the same conflicts a third time.

eubuw8p,"I'm actually fairly disappointed with it.  I feel it largely abandoned what made Spiderman stand out among the dozens Marvel comic movies.  Namely the high school dynamics of Peter and his classmates.  In Homecoming, it felt like Peter was actually a part of the student body.  Where he knows each of the dozen or so teenagers in the school and debate team.  In Far from Home, Peter only really interacts with Ned and MJ.  Where the rest of the members of the school trip are just obligatory.  And everyone not Peter or MJ is an absolute moron, especially the teachers.  Granted, the Peter and MJ scenes were very good on their own and worth seeing.

But that entire after credits scene where Spiderman's identity gets exposed left a bad taste in my mouth.  The entire movie felt like a retreat from the comedic but surprisingly sweet high school dynamic with somewhat low-scale scales stakes of Homecoming in favor the large cinematic battles that I see in every Marvel movie.  The MJ date had me hoping the series would return to the old dynamic.  The reveal just told me that will not be happening and gives me very little to look forward to in the next Spiderman.",c7xhmz

I didnt really feel excited until mysterio started his illusion game with siderman. That was really creative and terrifying. Only thing I dont understand is how  mysterio became THAT much more loved than spiderman so quickly? Seemed like he literally showed up, became the favorite, and now everyone is going to turn on spiderman just like that? Spider man is an avenger and has been a part of multiple world saving events. Seems a bit flawed but I guess they're going on how easily fooled the mass can be.  7.8/10",c7xhmz

While not as airtight as Homecoming, I admire the direction they took Peter in this time around.  This serves as the perfect epilogue to Endgame. Far from Home is bold, big and ballsy. The future of the MCU is brighter than ever before. The mind illusion sequence is my favourite scene of the year so far.

------------------------------------
Things I liked:
--------------------------------------

The teacher had good moments throughout the movie

MJ finally showed more character than deadpan sarcasm in this movie

I like Tom Holland as Spider man more and more with each movie

More jokes landed for me than I expected

Swinging scene at the end pre-MJ was some nice spidey-porn

Somehow not expecting the villain reveal, I genuinely thought he was an alternate reality Mysterio that was good instead of evil in his world. I got duped

lightsaber door cutting scene.

-----------------------------------------
Things I anti-liked
--------------------------------------------

The movie interrupted scenes with tension with comedy in places that didn't need it

I thought Brad was going to figure something out at some point, all his suspicion was for nothing.

Mysterio minions didn't betray him for some reason

Predictable moments everywhere including but not limited to:
-""I like it better this way"" to the broken necklace
-using ""Peter tingle"" to defeat illusions

Lots of cheesy stuff, the worst offender for me was the suit building scene in the jet when happy was looking at Peter being ""the new iron man""

Villain's character was very boring after initial reveal, very 2D

Peter tingle was broken and fixed but wasn't broken but only works if he wants but not on bananas, idfk and neither does the movie",c7xhmz
esu69h7,"I watched it today at a 10:20am showing at the largest CineMark in my area.  Looks like 80% of the seats were purchased, it seats about 200 so I'd say about 160 tickets purchased to this showing.

&#x200B;

I was really disappointed with Spider-Man: Homecoming but I'm happy to announce I absolutely loved this movie.  I can't even think of a scene that should be taken off, I feel it was really well directed.  From start to end I was either laughing or by the edge of my seat hoping Spider-Man and his friends wouldn't die.

&#x200B;

Was I the only one saddened by the twist in the story when you find out Mysterio is not who we thought he is?  I was completely fooled just like Peter was and felt it was a shame because he seemed like he could have been a good replacement for Iron Man.

&#x200B;

I thought it was cool following his class around in their field trip to far away countries.  I was so glad that Peter's friend Ned found a girlfriend because I think part of the reason I didn't like Homecoming was that he was too close to Peter.  Unfortunately near the end of the movie we find out they have broken up.  Hmm well hopefully they get back together or he finds another girlfriend.

&#x200B;

Zendaya was excellent this time as MJ and maybe I should rewatch Homecoming, maybe I was a bit too harsh on her portrayal.  After I watched Homecoming I thought she was just way too negative and nothing like what I thought MJ should be.  Now after Far From Home I'm in love with her character.  Maybe when I watched Homecoming I was in a bad mood or something I don't know.

&#x200B;

Awesome movie I'm going to see Far From Home again tomorrow and maybe Saturday too.  Even the end credits scenes were good, and speaking about the end credits how is Peter going to handle the revelation to the world that he's Spider-Man?  I don't think that has ever happened before in the Spider-Man movies.

et95kqc,So if Mysterio succeeded and became an Avenger... how would he have helped during actual threats?,c7xhmz
et9s0u2,"Just....spoilers ahead. Lots of it. Also, these are all hot takes, so expect some jarbled garbage.

I'm surprised that they never referenced the end credit scene of Homecoming, or the previous love interest. The fact that he's moved on doesn't bug me, but the fact that he fell hard for one girl then moved on to the next seemed really jarring. 

I liked Mysterio overall, but knowing the twist beforehand made the first half of the movie feel...pointless? I guess at points where Mysterio got really likeable made me hope he was a good guy and something turned him bad in the movie and he was telling the truth, instead of him lying the entire time. Honestly, he becomes uninteresting once you know his origin. His character becomes way too one dimensional, and very cartoony. its such a shame. Jake Gyllanhall offered such a nuanced performance until the toast scene (which I actually enjoyed). Eventually he just became the stereotypical angry, yelling villain. 

My biggest issue with Spiderman movies in general, is I feel like they are a lot about nerfing him. And I fully acknowledge that this might just be a me problem. I watched Homecoming, and was really excited for him to use the new suit but its in baby mode for the first half of the movie, we get a small taste of what the suit can do, then it gets taken away. Then Infinity War/End Game comes out, he gets the Iron Suit, but is in both movies for maybe a combined 10 minutes where we actually see him using the suit. Then we get here, opens with ANOTHER new suit, and he decides to just leave it at home, and gets a ""stealth"" suit. When we get to the end of the movie, and he gets ANOTHER new suit, we see him use two new features, once. 

Nitpicking aside, I thought the movie overall was pretty good. Most Spider-man fans probably knew that Mysterio was the main villain, which made the first half of the movie drag on waiting for the actual villain, but at least Gyllanhal's performance was really solid to carry them out. The big drone fight was really good, and I really liked Spiderman's choreography throughout the movie. It feels good that he's using webs as more then just wrap baddies and swing around (The net he makes to capture the drones I thought was one of the best scenes in the movie). Especially in 3D. And like I said, Mysterio was great early in the movie. I really liked Peter's character when he wasn't being so...insecure. He still has really funny quips, and some of the more outlandish positions he finds himself in is great. But the best part of the movie, by far, is when he's in the plane making a new suit. You can see his intelligence, and I feel like this movie showcased that way more then any other Spiderman movie, where we just accept that he's intelligent. We see what happens to him when he's thrown out of his element and has to improvise (not great....) and then we see what happens when he has time to actually plan things out. He's a 17 year old genius. When he is caught off guard by Mysterio in the warehouse, we see a scared 17 year old not knowing how to deal with all this new information. Then in the plane, designing the new suit, we see that yes. He is a genius. He can plan for things, he can come up with contingencies. 

Also, they finally showed off the Spider-sense! I'm not excited about the new name for it, and I am hoping it's played just for laughs in this movie. 

The mid-credit scene was really good, and I hope that they don't retcon it. It really pushes Spider-man even further into having to grow up. A few people know the truth, but unfortunately they are all people who have worked in the background. It's a long road ahead for Peter to turn his image around. 

Overall, I felt like the theming of the movie is how Peter needs to gain confidence. He has so little faith in himself. While not touched on directly, I actually feel like they've been leading up to this. He started off as cocky, and started seeing how big of problems the Avengers actually have to deal with, and he keeps getting punched down. If you think about it, since Infinity War, he has just been taking hit after hit. Even in Homecoming, he is constantly coming up short and has to find some way to overcome his cockiness. The mid-credit scene was a good way of saying ""You really don't have the luxury of a slow and steady pace to becoming a hero."" 

With that being said, the entire movie just felt like an exercise in pointlessness. Like mentioned earlier, the first half of the movie is pointless because its just an hour long set up for the second half of the movie, which doesn't play into the first part at all. Then the actual post credit scene makes Mysterio's entire plot of wanting to kill Fury pointless. The entire journey Peter has to make because Iron Man chose him is pointless because now he's thrust into that position instead of getting to choose. Hell, even his relationship with MJ is probably pointless, because every super hero does the whole ""We can't be together it'll be too dangerous"" (which is a stupid trope, because they end up getting targeted anyway). 

Overall, I think the movie is best equated with Ned's relationship. A nice summer fling that is fun while it lasted, but ultimately, pointless. 

I know I complained a lot about the movie, but I really did enjoy it. The good parts outshone the small parts, and most of my complaints are nit-picky. Honestly, if you haven't already, I would definitely check out the movie.",c7xhmz

Is anybody else iffy on the whole Glasses plot device? Like, it feels like a stretch that Tony would make those with barely any safeguards and then hand them over to Peter, considering he wouldn’t even let him access all the programs in his own suit in the last film.

etsxsiz,"I personally was kind of disappointed. For me it has its problems and I honestly expected it to better. Don't get me wrong there's definitely a lot I enjoyed because ultimately it's a fun movie with great action and likeable, well acted characters. And I really like Tom Holland's spider-man. That being said I personally feel the movie struggled with pacing and felt kind of all over the place at times. The movie takes place after the catastrophic events of endgame, so it's understandable that the story suffers a bit with how much it has to cover. I wish there was more time with Mysterio, I thought he was fun to watch but as a villain I thought he kinda fell flat, idk though it seems like this is a very unpopular opinion. And in general I wish they spent more time with the dramatic or emotional scenes. I think that a lighter, more fun tone makes a lot of sense for the mcu spider-man but I still think they can balance this and heavier themes more successfully. The jokes could be toned down but just a tad. I felt homecoming was more successful with its use of humor because this one a lot of the jokes to me felt forced and didn't hit the mark. But I think the final act was pretty strong and the first act was where it struggled most. My biggest gripe is I think it's really lame that they made aunt May knowing he's spider-man a big deal in homecoming and it looked like it was set up for a conflict in this movie. But instead they did nothing with it and she has not just accepted he's spider-man but is full on supporting him putting himself in danger. It's unrealistic and contradicts with her characterization in homecoming, which was a lot better because she was treated like an actual mother figure but in this movie her whole character is being a milf. I think this movie took a lot of steps in the right direction for spider-man's character and the consequences he faces, but it also took a couple of missteps. All in all a pretty mixed bag.

Going into this, both the trailers, critic reviews, and just general gut feeling made me think that this film was going to be an average MCU film, nothing too special.

Thank God the game and Spider-Verse's a thing, and i have my ""true Spidey"" version out there to look forward to because there at Marvel they forgot what makes him awesome.

They totally had it in Civil War, but they ditched it in favour of being different.

et0y9zi,"Overall I give this film a 6/10. 

  
The Positive

  
Mysterio was a awesome villain. Seriously Jake killed it and really did a good job at being very manipulating. I liked the brutality of Mysterio, I gasped when it showed he tried to shot spidey in the head, really wasn't expecting that in a Disney movie.  I enjoyed the fight scenes and the visuals a lot. Happy did a really good job in this movie and it's weird, but thinking back I wish he had gotten more screen time.

&#x200B;

The Negative

&#x200B;

This feels a lot like Homecoming to me except with a different villian. Peter really didn't grow as a hero or really even as a character from Homecoming to this movie.  The cringey romance plot really got boring to me after a couple of scenes (maybe because I'm old).  I know it's dumb but I really don't like the secret identity being spoiled, it's such a huge part of Spiderman's story that I feel kind of robbed by giving it out while he's still in high school.

&#x200B;

Overall not a bad movie, but I don't really feel like it brought anything really new to the table.  It seems that Disney played it pretty safe with this movie.",c7xhmz
etocnna,"Peter is a dummy in this movie. He shouldn't have trusted someone he just met with Stark's gift, not to mention that it is a totally OP weapon.

etso14k,"Was anybody else disturbed that the Black Dahlia murder was referred to so many times? Peter getting MJ a glass Black Dahlia because that's her favorite murder or something like that, and it getting brought up a couple more times besides?

If you didn't already know the Black Dahlia was an infamous unsolved murder where the victim was dumped by the side of the road cut in half at the waist. I saw photos of her body sprawled out when I was a teen and it fucked me up good... I've seen worse photographs since then but none that had the impact the Black Dahlia did. It's insanely horrific.

It bugs me so much because I wonder if 10 year olds are going to get back from watching the movie and do a google image search for Black Dahlia. It's really not necessary to put that idea in a family friendly film.

If you've never seen it, you're probably the kind of person who wouldn't want to.",c7xhmz
eua11i6,"Cool visual fx (as one would expect from a high-budget Marvel film) and some tight fight scene choreography. The trippy scene in the warehouse with all the drone illusions was really cool to watch; definitely my favourite part.

That said, the dialogue was pretty cringey and any moments that involved character development watched like a shitty teen drama. A lot of the plot was predictable and riddled with cliché. The relationship between Peter's friend and the blonde girl was entirely unnecessary and just gave the cringe-inducing dialogue more time to shine.  

Wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend a film enthusiast go and watch it, but if you have kids there's probably enough visual entertainment there to keep you in your seat.

There were a few cool/fun moments that I liked A LOT, but I felt like the middle was a bit blah. That being said, the cool moments I enjoyed:

* The cheap tribute to the lost Avengers, and seeing an explanation of what happened when everyone returned from the snap.
* Mysterio, and the whole scorned Stark employees thing.

Mysterio telling Peter how people need some kind of hero/lie was cool because it showed what the screenwriters could’ve talked about in the film but instead decided to make Peter inconsistently stupid throughout the film by forcing conflict incredibly hard. 

Peter has to pick up a suit not in Berlin but at random stop from a hot blonde chick who forces him to unclothe at which point the one guy we hate comes in (where was the SHIELD agent driving the bus?) and grabs a picture that he then threatens to show to MJ but doesn’t do right away and instead waits to do until after Peter becomes 5 years old and doesn’t know how to say the words  “Edith stop” and instead continues to make things worse in the most convoluted way possible until solving it in the dumbest way I can think of. 

...And then an hour later in the film on the Iron Man plane he can easily operate the much more complicated suit building gadget? But he can’t talk to glasses. Cool. 

Oh and his Peter Tingle™️ goes away why? and comes back why? 

Whats worse is this is the best cast we’ve gotten yet with easily the best live action spidey and it cant hold a narrative candle to what Raimi did nearly two decades ago.

etbeanz,"So I’ve had a few days to think about it, and next to the Amazing Spider-Man 2, this is probably my least favorite Spider-Man film of all time. I know that will be controversial, but it is what it is. These films just change too much about the character of Peter Parker. We don’t get a single mention of Uncle Ben, it’s almost like he never even existed. Aunt May knowing Peter is Spider-Man and actually encouraging him to put himself in danger makes her a horrible guardian and doesn’t make any sense. A lot of the humor just doesn’t land. The Ned/Betty stuff was funny at first but the delivery after they got off the plane just fell flat. Jake Gyllenhaal is probably my favorite actor and he’s given absolutely nothing to work with. That scene in the bar with the embarrassing exposition completely took me out of the film. There’s just no tension, no stakes. I’m legitimately not scared for anyone’s safety. The action sequences are pretty generic and uninspired overall. I really hope Jon Watts isn’t directing the next film, because his interpretation of Spider-Man might be one of the least appealing I’ve ever come across.

Also, it's kinda wack that if tony hadn't left that post it note in the glasses, peter never would have been inspired to give them away. That's like one step below the rat from end game levels of luck for Mysterio.

I also really like how the MCU MJ is way different from plain vanilla MJ. She's weird and quirky (and also somewhat smart.... hey she figured out who Peter is!). Hopefully she gets some red hair soon.

The beauty of these movies is the minor details, that said. I may have missed some stuff, but they were building up to the Sinister Six at the end of Homecoming with both Vulture and Scorpion. I didn't see this get mentioned. Or do you guys think that his friend who operated the drones from a remote location will carry on Mysterio's legacy having downloaded information to the thumb drive? (I was hoping Mysterio lives, because Jake did a great job).

Was a bit bummed out that the alternate Earths weren't real... Or did Mysterio knew about the time travel event of Endgame and just played that into Nick Fury's trust?

did anybody else expect them to do another bait & switch with the rival character who also liked MJ? AKA, i was expecting them to say his last name was osborne, and his family calls him harry LOL

Rushed pace, choppy editing, contrived (but pretty funny) gags, complete absence of the Ned-Peter dynamic that was so good last time, and far too little MJ. I laughed a lot, so Idk if I can really complain, but from a filmic perspective it was pretty underwhelming. Even the action set pieces were weak; Mysterio as a hero is soooo boring lmao. The dumb lasers and flying green smoke vs big water/fire monster fights we got were slogs. And in both fights, Peter has minimal contributions, swinging around trying to keep tower/ferris wheel up. And the moments with Peter out of suit jumping around in Venice looked fake as shit.

&#x200B;

The 2nd half is much better. More MJ, a bit more Ned, more interesting Mysterio -- the BARF fights are very very good, Gyllenhaal is excellent once he's allowed to stop playing a bad actor playing a superhero. Still, thematically a rehash and largely filler in the grand scheme of things.

Gyllenhaal was a good choice for Mysterio, but even though he's one of my favorite villains, i don't think they nailed the character. The part before his big 'reveal' (surprise surprise) is just too damn long. Then there's 2 minutes of actual one-on-one mysterio illusions and then he dies (or does he?). It was awesome to see J.K.

\- Once again, everything is about Tony Stark. Of course Mysterio is a disgruntled ex-employee of Stark. Why can't Spider-Man be about Spider-Man?

A universal surveillance/spy system that can kill people with drone strikes due to misunderstandings, and anyone with a pair of glasses can control. Yeah, brilliant. Not to mention that being able to spy on and hack into people's phones & computers is apparently a good thing. 

\- The MCU must really hate secret identities since both Spider-Man films have been full of people finding out, culminating in the mid-credits scene.

esp9e5i,"It was great. A solid superhero story with a look into a post-Endgame world, which is exactly what I wanted. I wish Mysterio's motivations were different though. The whole thing with him being pissed off at Tony Stark felt too similar to Vulture in Homecoming. I'm not a fan of MJ in this movie either. Her and Peter's relationship felt a bit rushed and her character felt off compared to how she was in Homecoming. It's been a while but in that movie I remember her being witty and a fast talker, but here she was just as awkward as Peter.

Peter does go through genuine character development though with him feeling pressure to be the next Iron Man. Ned is hilarious too. The CGI was amazing. The Mysterio illusion sequence had some of the best visuals in the entire MCU - that fucking part where Iron Man comes out of the grave caught me off guard.

The twist in the post-credit scene was great and has me excited for future movies, but I feel like I'm the only one who thinks they shouldn't have brought back J.K. to play Jonah. It's not because he isn't a good fit for the character (he's perfect and I doubt anyone will ever beat him), but because this obviously isn't the same Jonah from Raimi's trilogy so I think they should have gotten a different actor to portray him. Imagine if they brought Wolverine into the MCU but Hugh Jackman was still playing him. That would be dumb and very confusing for general audiences.",c7xhmz
esw1mx1,"The mindfuck illusion in the middle  that ended in Peter getting hit by a train and the credits scene was probably the best parts of Far From Home.  I also liked Peter's character development and how he copes with Tony's death. It was well done. And MJ is a cool character too. But if it weren't for those points, I probably would have given this movie a less favorable rating.


Felt like Mysterio was great in this movie but slightly mishandled. Like they slightly rushed his character and gave more time to the cluster bag mess  of a European school trip.  I like the idea of the twist scene that Mysterio faked the illusions, is an egoist on steroids, and is willing to lie and manipulate the media to become the next hero-god of Earth. But the  plot twist scene after he deceived Spider-Man should have been a little bit more ""serious"" instead of comedic.  Not sure if comedic is the right word to describe it, but it was.  Yes, it was wrong of him to betray Spider Man and I hated him for it, but it felt off. That part when Mysterio started talking about why him and his gang of minions hate Tony Stark especially with scenes from earlier films had me chuckling instead of being shocked. It reminds me of the scene from the 2012 Sacha Baron Cohen comedy movie ""The Dictator"" where the Dictator ""General Aladeen"" walks into a restaurant in New York, and it turns out that all the people that Aladeen had executed for no good reason turned out to be alive sitting in the tables . And the very establishment he walked into turned out to be an Anti Aladeen restaurant. [ Here is the scene for reference ](https://youtu.be/Sl1ziJtr0zc). Specifically the beginning part of it.  I liked the  Far From Home twist and saw it from a mile away but the scene should have been handled better with a bit more of a heavy emotional weight. Or maybe I'm interpreting it wrong and that Mysterio is willing to fuck over the world and deceive them all because of Tony Stark calling his work barf.

 Still, Mysterio is one disturbed man, most likely a narcissist. Jake Gyllenhall did him good. He went from Spidey's fake friend- hero buddy to a theatrics  super-villain that's willing to kill anything in his way for the sake of recognition and power.  He still liked Peter, but because of his grand goals, Peter had to die for the cause. Still felt there should have been one scene by himself where he has a breakdown when things don't go to plan or a better rage scene than pointing the drone at his minion, since he was shown to lose his temper. I just watched Prisoners the day before, and [I felt there should have been a rage scene similar to this ]   (https://youtu.be/xCyzdQ8kqis ). 

Despite what I said about my gripes about the movie, I admit some of that is due to slightly higher expectations for this movie and the fact that I'm a fan of Gyllenhaal's  acting in his past works.  I gotta bring up that shot of him lying down on the glass saying  “People will believe anything."" was so haunting based on how he delivered it face down and how that particular shot was framed. It help foreshadow the scene during the credits, where he lied to the world that Spider Man was behind the elementals  attacks on Europe that has cost many lives. He has fucked up Spiderman's life and reputation for good, because much of the public will believe his word.  Mysterio is probably one of the top MCU villains so far.

Also, that JK Simmons cameo was top notch! The post credits with the revelation that Nick and Marie Hill was a Skrull was pretty funny too. Seems like Avengers will go to space next with the revelation of the battle station.

Overall, I liked this movie, and the dark consequences that will impact Peter in the future. I'm super excited for the sequel. I'm excited for Mysterio to return. I don't think we've had returning Spider-man villains on film before, if I am mistaken.

 If you wanna see more Mysterio - like roles from Gyllenhaal ((maybe even creepier than Mysterio)), I would recommend Nightcrawler.  Maybe Lou (the NightCrawler character) is not like him exactly, but he is a manipulative and mentally unstable son of a gun. https://youtu.be/5srYR6oGJ_k   He's ..creepy.",c7xhmz

I'm especially surprised cause I really liked Homecoming, but this just felt uninspired, and it just wasn't what I wanted to see in a Spider-Man movie.

\- Peter has many times he could have given away his identity. (only a festival mask against the hydro man, swinging with MJ at the end)

\- the amount of drones kind of took me out of the moment. i find it hard to believe spider-man was able to dodge so many bullets flying from like what 100+ drones?  

\- what i really loved in the movie the most , of course, was Mysterio. His illusion were awesome BUT the part that left me a little disappointed was when Spider-man found Mysterio at the end. The moment Mysterio casts the illusion where its all black and green smoke starts appearing, i thought Spider-man was going to be in deep shit where he was going to get really fucked before finding a way to escape. NOPE! his spidey sense kicked in and just breezed through it.",c7xhmz
esna3g8,"Post movie thoughts...

1.) The movie was a 7/10 imo

2.) Loved the Spidey action

3.) Liked Tom and Zendaya's chemistry/relationship

4.) Mysterio was good - some of the third act visuals were awesome (Loved the whole Mysterio voiceover too) but my god the drones became too much

5.) Aunt May is sex joke the character...love Marisa Tomei but not a fan of this iteration


6.) The pacing was bad...movie drags at times.


7.) Peter and the Iron Man ""create your suit"" scene was cringey imo...just not a fan of this storyline at all


8.) Let's build up Peter's world and keep the MCU connections to a minimum. There's a lot to work with without referencing the guy Obediah yelled at in Iron Man or shoehorning Nick Fury and Colbie Smulders into the movie. 


TL;DR: The movies frustrating because there is some really great stuff here. But the pacing, and some character choices keep it below Homecoming for me.",c7xhmz
esnhslq,"Overall I'm someone who isn't on the ""Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-Man"" hype train. I thought Homecoming was a good but flawed movie and the first half of this movie really dragged a bit and it didn't feel like anything special or particularly entertaining. I also thought the humor fell very flat overall in the start. However, the second half of the movie once the stakes become apparent and all, I thought was actually great and was highly entertained by. All the Mysterio stuff is wonderful and one thing that's actually carrying these Spider-Man movies highly are the antagonists much more so than the hero which is kind of a 180 for MCU flicks. The depiction and use of Mysterio's illusions was perfectly done and the movie gives a lot of cool Spidey action overall, including some really awesome Spider Sense feats that feel very aware of fans (ridiculously) claiming that suddenly he didn't have Spider Sense for some reason even though it was distinctly depicted from the start in Civil War.

The mid-credits scene was an awesome note to end on, JK Simmons returning as Jameson and still seeming like he'll be playing a different version of him was really well done and it sets the stage for an actually interesting premise to the next Spidey movie, which I think will help a lot because Homecoming and Far From Home haven't really been that enticing as far as just having a good context for the story being told, but they did have good ways to twist the stories they had and make it better.

The post-credit scene is surely interesting, but it feels like a little *too* little to put on this movie? It's so unclear what the state of the MCU is right now that I think simply showing us Nick Fury is out in space wasn't quite enough.",c7xhmz

euf6y5e,"I was really disappointed in this.

The whole travelogue in the first half just doesn’t belong in this genre of movie.

The teachers were stupid for no good reason.  They didn’t add to the plot or character development.  It was perhaps intended as comic relief, but occurred at points that needed no coming relief.

The idea of Peter not being ready for all this responsibility has so much potential, but was handled shallowly.

The villain was an egotistical trope, with no real motivation for him being the one in charged.  They played a little bit with the tropes around villain and underling, but never took it seriously, nor did anything with what could have been a good evil team.

The “imposter to get information” tactic is another overused trope.

The “hero isn’t really dead” was way too obvious.  There was nothing to make us work at “how does he get out of this one”.  

The technology was too omnipotent.

The whole “not the real villain” trope ending Act 1 was way too manipulative of the audience.",c7xhmz
etbr4dq,"Felt like a half-effort. Coming off the climax of the series, this film felt like an attempt to tie up loose ends and set up future plots, but they needed a story so they threw together a half-baked light comedy.

The first half is pretty sloppy and mostly forgettable. Too much exposition (Gyllenhaal has a speech that was only for the audience), and the rules of Mysterio’s powers were fuzzy. Some timeline and plot bending that is maybe explained, but not clear. But, once the third act gets rolling the film picks up.

Zendaya is probably the greatest actress of her, or any, generation, but her character was not very consistent with the first movie. Still, she should be the star.

This doesn’t feel like a marquee entry in the MCU, which is a shame as Spider-Man still feels too unimportant in the grand scheme. This one will go down with many Marvel movies as an okay, but forgettable, piece to the Marvel Universe.",c7xhmz

et068kv,"Saw this last night. IMO this was a really sub-par MCU and Spider-Man entry. To it's credit, the actors all do very fine work and the movie is VERY funny, so you will probably walk out feeling entertained... but then get home and realize there was no substance at all and virtually nothing at stake in the film.

Literally every other line/scene involves some kind of joke, and it's honestly just too much. You can insert that Captain America line: ""Is everything a joke to you?"" right here and it perfectly describes this movie. There is not enough seriousness to give the film a proper balance and emotional weight. Even when characters believe that the Earth might be doomed, they still have time to crack jokes. I mean, that worked in Homecoming because Spidey had mostly parochial concerns. But in the MCU canon now, he's been to another planet, got snapped, and then helped defeat Thanos. You would think there would be at least *some* more mature and serious attitude towards his superhero life.

The action scenes were mostly disappointing with some really bad direction. For instance, the Hydro-man fight where Peter does nothing except hold the tower up... why!??? There weren't even any kids or people under it and he didn't even manage to save the tower for ""culture"" anyway.

How about the Molten Man fight where Spidey is nearly completely useless... That fight was like watching a Wood 5 League of Legends team fight unfolding (speaking from experience here) where Peter couldn't decide whether to go help his friends in the ferris wheel or fight the bad guy. Seriously, if you can web and swing heavy boulders around, then it shouldn't be too hard to just snatch your friends out of danger and then focus on the fight.

The best of the action pieces is the construction site scene where Mysterio overwhelms Peter with illusions. Visually, it was very well done, but I couldn't help but feel it was a bit too one-sided. Even if the villain wins a particular battle, the hero should still get a couple of good shots in... and surviving getting hit by a HSR train straight on like that strains credulity.

The climactic battle was kind of a mess. When it's just Spidey versus the drones the action is cut a bit too quickly so that it just turns into a CGI fest with a bunch of explosions everywhere. When he finally gets inside the bridge to confront Beck, it's once again way too one-sided. Spidey literally just walks down the hallway and wipes out all the drones faster than Darth Vader wiped out those Rebels in Rogue One.

In terms of the overall storyline, it's just not believable. Beck can only do his ""Avenger-level threat"" because of Stark's defense network. It's just not believable that Pepper who runs Stark Industries wouldn't know what was happening and have a way of shutting those down remotely. And even if she somehow couldn't, the moment one of the stronger Avengers on Earth like Dr Strange, Wanda, etc. find out about it they could literally just take out Beck in 2 seconds.

So all-in-all, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a really poor entry in both franchises. The acting and humor are well done, with the latter perhaps going way overboard. However, the action is really unbalanced and lacks the back and forth necessary to create the necessary dramatic tension, and the story makes no sense within the greater MCU.

6/10",c7xhmz
et3j1tp,"Movie was good but not great. I can’t describe it but it didn’t emotionally fulfill me I guess. The movies just feel too episodic. Not only in there nature but in they way they play out scene to scene. 

The movie is focused on Peter juggling his teenage life and Spider-Man which is quintessential to his character. But there were ZERO actual stakes in that. For example, his rivalry with brad. Brad was a dick, and we don’t see any actual comeuppance for him. Peter flaked on mj constantly, yet she didn’t give a shit and liked him the whole time. It would have been a lot better imo if brad actually had a little competition, and scenes like the opera showed the consequences of Peter being Spider-Man as she and brad grew closer. But no that conflict that was present in the beginning just immediately dropped without any resolution. Ned didn’t care that his best friend was gone for a good lot of the trip. His aunt didn’t care at all and didn’t really show the SLIGHTEST concern over Peter fighting. Honestly it seems like she was just eye candy... in every other incarnation she gives Pete some guidance or something and we usually get some emotional scene between the two. She didn’t give shit though. Once again kind of lowered the emotional stakes of the movie to me.  

Throughout there were way too many jokes that didn’t land in this movie. Particularly in first eurotrip third. Also moments like that one joke after Spider-Man stops all the drones, the teacher says to ned ‘give me that spear’ and Ned says ‘it’s a flabbard’ or whatever the fuck that’s called. Why did that need to be there!!?? That should have been a somewhat emotional moment I thought. Just an example, cheap jokes like that were littered throughout the movie. 

The mysterio illusion scenes were brilliant though. Easily the best part of the film, felt straight out of the comics. Drone fights at the end was really good too. And the end credits scene was awesome. 


All in all movie definitely felt straight out of a comic book. But it didn’t make for a stellar movie, just a good one. I guess i just don’t buy peters character development, and like I said the movie didn’t feel like it had that many consequences to me. I think the movie would benefit from cutting some scenes down. Like maybe the Denmark prison or other scenes like that.

et1om5p,"Idk. I am super conflicted. This was not a bad movie. There was nothing bad about it (well, the constant ""omg I have a plan to make MJ like me!!!11!1!1!!"" Shit at the beginning got annoying). 

But it just felt like such a placeholder. There was nothing really standout about it. It wasn't bad. But........it wasn't good either. Here I am hours later and there's nothing about it that has me excited (all of Endgame had me stiff for days, Iron Man getting stabbed in infinity wars had me super excited. Captain marvel just being a smartass had me excited. Far from home......has Marisa tomei? Really nothing stood out to me)

The bridge sequence was awesome.

I am just not invested in the future of the MCU with Tom as the face of the franchise. Maybe I am finally too old, but the high school drama theme does not appeal to me. Hopefully the next few installments can bring it back for me.",c7xhmz
esshoz4,"I found it to be just okay. Obviously both Tom and Jake are fantastic, but the rest of the movie was a little flat? Idk i felt like the flow was weird. There were tons of jokes at the start that weren't funny at all. It took a long time to get going. I felt like there wasn't enough fun times with spiderman. You don't really see him saving people. There's no train or building on fire scene. Just ned who obviously isn't going to die. 

And if you're gonna go on a road trip through Europe maybe show Europe? We say Ponte di Rialto, Charles Bridge and Tower bridge (What is it with bridges?) but basically nothing else. This could easily have taken place in america.

etkirg4,"Okay, before I get torn to shreds, this wasn't a bad film.

But god damn, Endgame really should have been the end. Anything less than fantastic would not be a solid follow up. This wasn't  fantastic.

Also the ""plot twist"" of one of Spider-Man's most famous villains being the villain was pretty lame. The scene where it's revealed Mysterio is evil was awful. I normally love Jake Gyllenhaal, and think he was solid for the rest of the film, but his ""I'M YELLING NOW THAT I'M EVIL. I'M ACTING!"" monologue was cringey.  I still find MJ annoying as well. She was the one thing I really didn't like from Homecoming.  Liz>MJ. Don't @ me.

Now the stuff I like. I thought the first battle between Mysterio and Spider-Man was one of the best scenes I've ever seen. Fakeout after fakeout just for the mother of all fakeouts was brillaint. The soundtrack was great too: Ramones, Go-Gos, ""Led Zeppelin"" etc I was nodding my head many a time. Martin Starr was a huge highlight of this movie. While I found humor very hit or miss, every thing he said was a hit.

Overall: 6.5/10. We didn't need this. Just my take. Trust me, I know I'm the odd man out.",c7xhmz
evtkz7g,"This movie has destroyed the spider man franchise IMHO.  It was such pablum.  Gone is the comic book element,  to be replaced by a long running sitcom;  and I hate sitcoms.  Spiderman is supposed to be sarcastic,  angst ridden,  and is supposed to have a first person commentary about his troubles.

The sitcom writers would never allow the actual comic book background story of spider man to infect their politically correct pop culture bubble gum story.  There is little to no tragedy now in spiderman.  His friends are randomly chosen from every race and pressure group that appeals to the leftist intelligentsia.

Spiderman's enemy has no real motivation for his crimes.  Spiderman himself is now 90% awkward teenager and 10% superhero.  There is no sense of mystery or amazement in the special effects. Thus there are no science fiction elements, really, and there is really no comic book sensibilities.

I truly miss Sam Raimi.  His movies were the best version of spiderman.  How long will be stuck with this fake spiderman I don't know,  but it's not looking good for Marvel's future.  Disney has finally sunk it's evil claws into the franchise,  and will now turn it into cinderella with sticky feet.",c7xhmz

Thought it was beautiful and completes the arc of him no longer being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He's an Avenger and now one of Earth's biggest heroes. Its not just Queens now or Venice.

esq3wh9,"Just got back and wow, my favorite Spider-Man live action film to date. Holland just continues to prove that he is undoubtedly the best Peter Parker/Spider-man ever. From the awkward crush scenes with MJ, to being a kid who still just wants to be a kid, to still mourning the death of his hero, Holland keeps on killing the game. The developing love between Peter and MJ was staged really well and Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry together. Their awkwardness yet attraction is super realistic to high school romance and I smiled with every scene they were in together. Mysterio was a fantastic villain. Gyllenhaal had a great performance and I’m hoping he is still living and will make another appearance in the MCU. 

Issues I had: MJ’s character was a little off to me. I loved her boldness and confidence in Homecoming and felt she was more shy and awkward in FFH. But given the blip and her and Peter’s relationship developing I can see the justification for her being shy. 

Mysterio’s motive was a little bland for my taste. It was clear from after his first scene that he was going to be the antagonist, and I was either hoping for a bigger reveal or a better backstory... neither happened. Though the contrast between Beck hating Tony and Peter loving him was interesting, hatred for Tony Stark isn’t mind-blowing or substantial enough for me. That whole BARF backstory scene at the pub was awkward. 

I was hoping for a little more emotional vulnerability from Peter after Tony’s death. I wish the scene with Peter and Happy had gone just a little further emotionally and we really could have seen Peter fully grieving Tony’s death. I was assuming Tony’s death was going to be the “Uncle Ben moment” for this Spider-man and was left unsatisfied. I think Peter’s character development was really tested in this film but I wish that scene had gone a little further.

CGI was hit or miss, some fight scenes it was just pretty bad but I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as early MCU movies (come on guys- worse than Thor? no way).

I was hoping the multi-verse plot was explored more and was disappointed that we didn’t get more closure or explanation about it. I was super excited to see what that revelation would bring to the MCU but I’m still holding out hope. 

Things I won’t be able to stop thinking about: 

The scene with Peter working on his suit with Happy watching on and playing music. Ugh. That was amazing. Such a great tease and I loved seeing Happy and knowing exactly what he was thinking. That scene was perfect and I wouldn’t change a thing. 

The first fight scene between Peter and Mysterio. Wow. I’m not one who typically LOVES MCU fight scenes - especially when they drag on for so long- but this was hands down the best fight scene in a non-Avengers MCU movie. The VFX in this scene are amazing and it was unlike anything I’ve seen in a MCU movie. Mysterio’s voice over gave me retro-villain speech vibes in this scene which I appreciated and Tony’s grave and Peter getting hit by the train shocked me in the best way. 

The mid-credit and post-credit scenes. Phenomenal. I loved seeing JJJ back (though when I gasped I had to explain to my younger brothers who that was) and I was so happy to see The Daily Bugle in the MCU- which was a story line I was missing. Not sure where Marvel is going to take that story line but I can’t wait to find out. So glad thay the post-credit scenes cleared everything up. I kept finding myself asking wtf was up with Fury, then the post credit scene happened and it was exactly what I never knew I needed. Wasn’t expecting it but was so happy to have that extra layer. Can’t wait to go rewatch it and look for things I missed. 

Edit to add: I also loved seeing Peter get emotional at parts where the typical “hero” shouldn’t get emotional. He tears up multiple times throughout the movie, and I loved seeing that he’s still a kid trying to process his emotions. Seeing him tear up while fighting Mysterio was a touch I loved. 

Overall a great MCU movie and the perfect way to tie up Phase 3. My issues with the movie are pretty small when considering how much I enjoyed it. The contrast in high school movie and superhero movie perfectly capture Peter’s struggle and I’m excited for the future of the MCU. 8/10.",c7xhmz

esptowb,"I may be in the minority here, but I just watched this movie and was thoroughly underwhelmed. Let me first say that I loved pretty much everything about Homecoming and when Tom Holland was first announced as Peter, I couldn't have been more excited. They have nailed the recasting in every way. That said, I have some serious gripes with this movie, and apologies ahead of time for the length of this post.  


1. The plot is a huge problem for me in that the villain ""twist"" is so completely telegraphed, it's comical. From the first fight scene and Mysterio's interaction with Peter, you immediately get the sense that he's ""putting on a show"" and the reveal loses all momentum. After that rooftop convo in Prague you're basically like ""Yep, Mysterio is the bad guy."" Which brings me to.....
2. The reveal of the plan itself. That bar scene was one huge cringefest of hamfisted exposition that couldn't be any more rushed. It's akin to the old trope of villians who monologue before their master stroke is complete. It drags on for so long and Gyllenhaal is so ridiculously over-the-top that I couldn't help rolling my eyes at every flashback. For comparison, I look at Zemo in Civil War. That is a great example of a villain that drops subtle hints along the way before the big reveal of their motivation and by the time he actually explains it, it's too late to stop it. This movie treats the audience like idiots and lazily explains the villain's entire origin/motivation/master plan in a 3 minute rant. (Also, why does the big baddie feel the need to explain the entire plan to his crew that have been in on the whole thing helping him from the start??)
3. Peter/MJ's romance. This one is hard for me because I think Tom and Zendaya have great chemistry on screen. I get that the filmmakers are going for the whole ""two-awkward-outcasts-bumbling-their-way-into-falling-for-each-other"" thing, but those scenes were so drawn out, and hit the same beats so many times, that I began to facepalm through every prolonged, awkward silence. It would be one thing if they did it once or twice, but they REALLY want you to know how bad Peter and MJ are at feelings. It isn't cute anymore and ends up taking you out of the movie completely.

&#x200B;

TLDR: All in all, was unimpressed. The plot is too predictable, The villain lacks subtlety and depth, Peter and MJ are trying way too hard to be goofy-cute together, but there were some decent fight sequences.",c7xhmz

esmlgtz,"It was a fun movie.  The only issue I had with it is that he gets Tony Stark's wonder emporium to build a new suit and... he builds that.  I mean he's got the Iron Spider suit at home, knows what it can do, why would you not make/use something like that!?  Sure, maybe there wasn't enough time, ok.

I feel like they introduced the Iron Spider suit too early, and it makes his other suits look like odd choices in comparison.

MJ... still not sold.  I actually don't mind Zendaya's character but, it's just not MJ.  Now I know people get all up in arms with the whole black vs white thing, modernization, etc.  But MJ is the center of Spider-man's world.  She's a fiesty red-headed girl who gives Peter a run for his money.  Zendaya is kind of... boring, by comparison.  Better in this one than in Homecoming though.

Still super confused by the ending with the Skrull.  I'm not sure what they were teasing there.

esnm2zj,"I don’t know if it landed well with me. Not to shit on it, I liked it and had fun. I think I still need to process the movie more, and also was having a bad day before anyway.

I really liked that they did the villain reveal early on rather than wait until the end. I don’t think any marvel fan ever thought Mysterio would actually be a good guy. I liked Jake Gyllenhaal overall. I loved the red and black suit. I loved the illusion fight scenes. I liked zendaya. The summer flings were funny. I liked the connection to the glasses with the drone tech. I liked the scenery overall and felt like they did more practical effects on the suits this time.

I didn’t like the stealth suit as much as I thought I would. I would have liked it to have some special function to it. I didn’t like that Mysterio’s groups were all angry ex-Stark employees, and it felt like they were trying to sell us on this idea that Stark was still an asshole. I didn’t like that none of them faced the consequences of their actions except for Mysterio. Idk that I necessarily liked that it was basically Spiderman vs drones. I like J Jonah Jameson but having the same actor feels messy with the canon. I didn’t like or understand the Talos end credits.",c7xhmz
esyoufc,"I thought it was alright. I'm not really into Marvel movies but there were some good moments. The projector tech led to a couple cool action scenes although I really am not a huge fan of how Marvel movies are pretty much science fiction at this point. I like more grounded superhero movies.

I kind of wish I didn't know who Mysterio was going into the movie. It probably would've been pretty cool if that was a twist. I think that knowing Mysterio is a villain makes the 1st half drag since you're kind of waiting for him to betray Spiderman. 

I was a big fan of how Mysterio looked with his mo-cap suit and the two flying drones next to him. It was a very distinct and organic look for a villain. 

I thought the bar scene where JG thanked everyone was pretty awful. There has got to be a way to get that information across without such a ham-fisted exposition-filled monologue.

I thought the Brad character would have been much more interesting if they didn't try to sway how the audience felt about him. In the beginning they seemed to work too hard to make him a chill, cool guy. And then later they worked too hard to make him antagonistic. I kind of wish they'd just made him a normal teenager who also liked MJ. 

I thought the other secondary teenage characters were one-dimensional too. Betty and Peter's friend. Compare these teenage characters to the teenage characters from the original Spiderman-- Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Mary Jane. Those characters felt a lot more real. Brad, Betty, Peter's friend, and the live-streaming kid in this movie felt like cardboard cutouts.

I think Happy is one of the most interesting characters and I think his relationship with Peter is interesting. The conversation on the plane stands out as some well-written dialogue.",c7xhmz

ethmwdb,"Did it feel like Spiderman was a little awkward? He displayed his power/humor well in Civil War, but since then, he's been hesitant to grow into his superhero role for a few movies now. The Spiderman I know is deadly. I know he's a high schooler, but he knew when the situation called for seriousness. 

The visual effects from Mysterio were obviously 100/10, but otherwise the plot felt very teen movie. It's missing a sorry of epicness to each film, almost like each film is ""the daily adventures of Spiderman"" rather than a standalone movie. It's at the risk of becoming forgettable. Perhaps if it was more about Spiderman lore rather than MCU movie, it would have been better. I appreciate that Marvel respects continuity, but each movie should be primarily about the titular character, and not ""Avengers: Spiderman's story"".

On to the good stuff...
Mysterio was hands down the best. Absolute best. But that's to be expected when great actors like Gyllenhaal join the MCU. A very smart villain.
Funny how at one time he and Tobey Maguire were getting confused for each other/contending for the same role, and now he has a role that calls even better acting chops required for Spiderman, he's the villain.

etq93zb,"I don't think this is a good movie. But before I continue, I'd just like to clarify that I found it to be entertaining and enjoyed it quite a bit. But that does not immediately equate to being a good film. So obviously, HEAVY SPOILER ALERT for the remainder of this. The film focuses too heavily on being fun and comedic and falls short of having any lasting impact. The most important part of the film is the after-credits scene, which quite honestly was so important that it should have been either the last scene of the movie or the only credit scene. Although I'm getting pretty tired of these post-credit scenes, I think their novelty has worn off and it's now just some ploy to tease the next film. If you're going to make a movie, please put the scenes in the movie, instead of increasing the number of credit scenes.

Jake Gyllenhaal appears out of place in his character, and his costume looks more like a Halloween joke in this film than anything else. I don't blame Jake for this, he did what he could with the script he was given and I think did an alright job, but I just don't believe him, nor do I feel any threat from his character. You knew exactly how Spider-Man could defeat him and it was just a matter of time before Peter thought hey wait, I have a developing spidey sense I should use (non-existent when his Aunt May hit him with a banana early on in the film). Mysterio offers no serious danger to the hero once the viewer realizes this and, given that this is now the eighth Spidey film along with decades of comics and pop culture references, that realization occurs pretty early on. We know what Spider-Man is capable of. Admittedly, fighting Peter was never really Mysterio's goal, but a movie about Spider-Man and a villain at least needs the villain to be able to stand his own, or at least have some advantage that would cause the audience to fear him. He even uses his real name and everyone just believes him when he says he's from another universe. His real name!! His character remains underdeveloped and the way in which the film explains his motives is incredibly weak. Myserio/Beck toasts to his crew at one point, using that opportunity to narrate exactly what they all did in the past, building an easy-way-out 2-minute backstory to satisfy the audience's questions about Beck's origins. This should be a sin in script writing. Rather than building proper dialogue throughout the film to reveal the backstory, shoehorning it in under the guise of a toast where Beck explains to his crew who all already know exactly what happened is amateur and downright shocking to see in a movie of this scale. But back to Mysterio's antics. they were simply an opportunity for the movie's VFX team(s) to flex their muscles, and for the audience to go wow. But they forgot about fight choreography and actual believable sequences. The fights are boring and predictable. And Peter is only involved in the first out of pure coincidence, and then gets roped in to the rest. Ultimately, Mysterio was just some wack-job angry at his former boss (understandably so) who killed a ton of people with his Elemental spooky ghost drones shooting at and destroying a ton of infrastructure. But let's not worry about bystanders actually getting injured or dying along the way, because this is about Spider-Man and his quest for love.

And while we're talking about people dying, the film missed an immense opportunity that was presented to it with the last MCU film. It's been five years and now everybody is back, and basically....ya nothing happened. Everything is the same, except for some younger siblings now being the older siblings, and the whole city landscapes being back to normal. I agree that this is a huge plot point to try to tackle, but it must be included to a more significant degree than what we got. It immediately was made into a joke within the opening scenes, with some comedic slideshow newscast and a marching band popping back into existence in the middle of a basketball game. None of the repercussions of the ""blip"" are fleshed out. What about the people that were not blipped away? What if they moved away, now in new relationships, died, etc. Such a big event thrown to the side as if nothing happened to make way for the REAL story at hand: Peter gallivanting around Europe with the girl of his dreams. I get it though, addressing all the repercussions might lead to some morbid places that the MCU usually doesn't go too much into, and I'm ok with that, but I still think this was poorly handled (basically not at all).

So the movie starts off with Peter going on some European educational trip (basically vacation, let's be honest), but not before appearing at a charity gala organized by his Aunt. The reveal at the end of last movie where she finds out he's Spider-Man was exactly as we thought: a funny way out of actually writing in a scenario where she discovers the truth and then being required to deal with what that means. This introduces the Happy/Aunt May comedic love plot which went nowhere and added basically zero to the plot. It also introduces Peter's grief about losing Tony. But not too much grief, as it never reappears with the same impact for the rest of the movie. The scene with Peter and Happy in the plane seems less genuine and more like a cheap ploy by the writers trying to prove to the audience that, see? Peter doesn't believe in himself without Tony, but oh wait, he magically knew how to operate that suit-making machine  and now Happy smiles out of admiration at the next Iron Man. And why bother showing Peter using Uncle Ben's briefcase (which then got destroyed, but whatever...) if Uncle Ben isn't even a character in this adaptation? he's never mentioned, so is this just fan service? What was the point?

So he goes to Europe. The trailer showed that bringing the suit with him was a big dilemma for him, but.... then shows him in a suit in Europe, so I guess that wasn't much of a dilemma after all. They show up in Venice, take a vaporetto (water taxi) from Marco Polo airport to Venice's Grand Canal and this truly annoyed me. They scene showed them entering from the south mouth of the canal, then the next shot is them travelling still on the Grand Canal but in the OPPOSITE direction near the Rialto Bridge, and then the very next shot they're back at the southern mouth of the canal entrance area going in the original direction. Google maps it, you'll see for yourself. I think this bothered me more than it should have.

His two teacher chaperone are bumbling idiots, although J. B. Smoove is hilarious. Why would anyone trust a travel company that redirects you after your first day in Venice and sends a thug in a black bus to transport you to Prague. But it's all business as usual and nobody questions it. Dimitri even LOOKS like a suspicious guy, cmon! And how were all his friends on this trip coincidentally not blipped away except that Brad guy? Seems too convenient. And the Brad Peter MJ love triangle was absolutely useless. Why did we need Brad involved in this now? Nobody even believed him when he tried to claim he saw Peter hooking up with someone, and why did he even walk in there? Everybody clearly went the other way for the bathroom? His character made no sense, and his sole purpose was to serve as reason for Peter to misuse the EDITH glasses and then arrive at the conclusion that he can't trust himself and then hand them off willingly to some dude he spoke to for 5 minutes the day prior.

That really bothered me. Peter handing the EDITH glasses over the Beck after having met him the day prior. The excuse that he's in the process of maturing and confused or whatever is just not going to cut it. He doesn't even know him!! He could have kept them, or given them back to Fury?? But instead hands them over to a guy he just met. It shouldn't matter how strong he is. And another thing, how did Beck even know that Peter had the glasses? They claimed ""after we found out who had the glasses"" or some nonsense like that, but that's ridiculous. Why would this knowledge even be anywhere? Tony would presumably not have told anyone, nor would he have had any need to create a digital trail about that. Maybe he had a will that Fury received, I don't know. But I do know that there is no situation in which Beck should have known about this.

And why did the trailer reveal that MJ knew Peter was Spider-Man??

There are other minor things in the film, like Peter not seeing Fury sitting in his room behind him when he's brushing his teeth in the mirror. But this is enough. The movie is fun, comedic, and has some impressive CGI. But it falls short of being believable and relies too heavily on convenience. Many character interactions are simple throw-aways and the villain is predictable and boring. The credit scenes were way more important that the movie's final scene about Peter confronting his Aunt and Happy about their supposed romance. I am interested to see what Fury has been planning though so I am looking forward to see where this leads. But this movie I just find was a waste and that post-credit scene was the only important addition to the MCU storyline we got with it. Damn this was long, I didn't expect to write so much.",c7xhmz
eskfj1g,"Crazy to think just 5 years ago TASM 2 was out and Sony was throwing everything at the wall to see what would work. A testament to Marvel for not only sweeping that under the rug so fast and well while simultaneously setting up a much more cohesive and impressive future for spidey.

esq8gkh,"While not as solid as Homecoming, [Spider-Man: Far From Home](http://hvnreviews.com/spider-man-far-from-home/) is still an incredibly fun superhero film with a lot of great comedy, drama, and excellent characters played by terrific actors. Tom Holland has serious chops, both in the comedic and dramatic scenes. I loved the scene between him and Happy talking about Stark. This feels much more like a sequel to Endgame than Homecoming, where all of it is about Peter and the whole world grieving Stark.  


Gyllenhaal was great like he always is, but I felt he was very underwritten. I didn't really buy his motivation and everything about him being a bad guy was very predictable, even for someone who's not a big comic book guy. The plot also felt pretty clunky, with a weird structure and pace, and some choppy editing. But still, the heart and soul were there, mostly thanks to the great performances across the board.  


I remember when this was first announced as the final film of Phase 3 that a lot of people were disappointed that Endgame wasn't the official end of it. Well, I think this is a much more fitting conclusion with Peter having to move on from Tony Stark and take on the responsibility he needs to. It's like a goodbye to the old heroes, ending an era, and then setting the stage for a new era.",c7xhmz

The stuff I didn't like:  The second fight was a bit too over the top for me. Peter wasn't moving fast enough to be dodging thousands of bullets from the drones. 
Someone above said it, but the swinging just looks too weightless, I guess? 
I still don't really like his Spidey suits. I wish his latest was just a basic suit with no Stark tech. That was the whole point. He's not Tony and he never will be. But that doesn't mean he can't make his own way.

No NY, no parker quips, forced humor, odd mysterio motivations. it just didn't work and there's nothing to gain from it.

I need help making sense why so many people enjoy this movie. I'm also starting to think the MCU is having real trouble making good solo films since Black Panther.",c7xhmz
eue2erv,"It was decent, but I felt like there wasn't much depth, much substance too it. The high school stuff was mainly badly done, jokes were often not great, the villain was very one-dimensional and the whole illusion tech thing made it a bit silly at times (few mins of solid cgi where spiderman gets destroyed, then it barely being used in the last fight.)

Still love Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal wasn't given much but did a great job with what he did have and thought the relationship between Peter and MJ was believable. 

However, the ending was extremely bad in my opinion and just seems like it has a ton of holes in it. When did he find the time to make this message? Couldn't this just be immediately debunked? I'm hoping that only the identify revelation bit gets kept, and they don't try to follow a spiderman is hated avenue.

Overall somewhere between a 6.5-7.5 for me. Depending on your enjoyment of marvel movies and how much you like tom holland, this movie is either decent with some great parts, or decent with some good parts.",c7xhmz
esvjkkl,"I personally would have liked it if they included the Mysterio-fake news scene as the real ending and not during the credits. It changes the tone a lot and just, I dunno, those mid credit scenes are supposed to be cool nods. Not massive plot points.",c7xhmz
et1hol9,"Saw it yesterday and while I did enjoy it, it did have it's share of problems. The running time is around 2 hours. I believe there's a great 90 minute movie in here. The first half of the movie (roughly until they get to the opera house) was too bloated with 90's high school movie stuff. The whole ""let's go to every country stuff"" was just there to show of different countries and did little to advance the story or plot. There was an abundance of focus on Peter Parker and a lack of Spider-Man here. It also reminded me of the weird supporting class. Ned somehow looks like he's in his mid thirties but is an ok character, although the ""romance"" plotline didn't add to the movie. Flash is just annoying but lacks the qualities that other Flashes had in the past. He's no athlete or...actually he doesn't have any qualities to get jealous of, which is kind of the point of the character. He doesn't have to be a jock. Heck, take that streaming stuff and emphasize how successful he is at it and how much money he makes of it. Now he's just....an annoying character with the name of a better character. 

And then we have MJ....oh boy. Talk about a black hole of charisma. She treats everyone like trash and we are supposed to believe Peter Parker is attracted to her? Another case of a bad character with a popular name attached to it. The easy way should have been to just give the characters different names.

However, the second half is awesome as it focuses more on Mysterio and Spider-Man. Mysterio is great in this movie and I was surprised to see how good his comic book costume works in live action. His illusion worked and actually made him surprisingly competent even though he has no super powers. I liked his motivation and it's awesome to see how they pulled of this character that comes across as hokey in other forms. He had he fooled for a bit with the multiverse-thing and being a good guy. You never know with multiverses and comic book craziness. I hadn't read up on this movie in advance so I had a feeling they may just have gone with Hydro-man as villain in this movie, with it taking place in Venice.

Like other posters, commented I agree that having the world know who Peter is feels a bit rushed. Having ""MJ"" and Ned know who he is, is one thing. They could have used that in the next movie with the next villain trying to find out who Spider-Man is. That in itself is a very interesting and tense storyline. Now that the cat is out of the bag, it kind of feels like they're going through the Spider-lore in fast-forward. It was a huge shock to see it and an awesome moment in itself with JK returning but I feel like it's going a bit too fast. That being said, I am curious what they're gonna do next now. I just hope they don't retcon it with it being revealed as being ""fake news"" with the help of Edith. Just stick with it.",c7xhmz
et3k98l,"Too much teen cringe for me. I mean, I know Peter is a teenager and therefore the context is going to reflect that, and I think the movie does a good job at showing ""the teen life"". It's just that it's not my flavor. Loved the fights with Quentin, though.",c7xhmz
etap3y0,"I wasn't a fan unfortunately. I thought the humor was either too bland even for MCU standards or played out by the first beat (the Ned/Betty scenes were immediately not funny). I felt that Peter really didn't grow throughout the entire film until how just has a conversation with Hogan and them bam I guess he's all better not. Really lacked any true change and introspection. And while Jake Gyllenhaal was great, in the end he was just another in a line of weakly motivated villains killed off before the credits role. I think if the best part of your movie is the post-credit stinger, you probably didn't make a great movie. Very dull, very lifeless, very forgettable.",c7xhmz
f065h2k,"So bland. The equivalent of eating a dry bowl of corn flakes. No element of surprise if you know Mysterio in the comics either. Acting reminded me of an episode of Power Rangers. Good for the younger audience I guess. As much as I am not a fan of Tom Holland's portrayal, I think it is partially due to the fact that they keep using his spider man movies as a filler for the avengers. I like the PS4 Spider Man game so much because it just feels like *SPIDER-MAN* and not Spider-man and the Avengers. Also because that spidey feels like a genuine person and not some fake looking kid who looks like he's been picked up and dropped into some fake setting.",c7xhmz

etwpwrj,"Having seen the movie twice here's where I'm at. I have a surprisingly long list of things I did not like for a movie that I would ultimately say I kind of liked. The highs are ***VERY*** high, it's pretty funny all the way through, that one fight scene you know the one is awesome, and Gyllenhaal is just always great. My gripes though:

- It's politically half-baked and lazy
- I don't fault the movie for the fact that I knew the twist was coming because I know the character. But the reveal is incredibly lazy and takes fucking forever. Gyllenhaal almost carries it on pure charm but it's just the least inspired thing ever
- The E.D.I.T.H. MacGuffin is trite nonsense even for a comic book movie
- Brad is poorly written and both of his big scenes are shockingly stupid
- Aunt May is treated like a piece of fuckmeat for two movies now and I hate it
- The first Mysterio fight is the peak of the movie creatively and it goes on for another hour. The final fight is just Peter blowing up a shitload of drones with Stormtrooper syndrome and my eyes glazed over.
- The script thinks MJ shouting a line of introspective dialogue is character development
- I like the post credit scenes generally as little extra treats, but when most of your narrative happens in two 40 second vignettes after the film is nominally over it's a problem

Overall, riddled with problems, carried by it's tone, it's peak, and it's two stars. A 5/10, but an enjoyable 5/10. Don't feel like I wasted my time, but won't see it again.",c7xhmz

* >!How did the drones not kill the kids and Happy in London when they were trapped in the room, the movie clearly shows how one drone had open vision on them before it crashed.!<

* >!Haven't seen Captain Marvel yet but the giant space station should be very able to not only locate Mysterio but also blast him into a pulp!<
* How could Mysterio even damage the elemental Beings? As far as I understood he only shoots gas at high speed",c7xhmz
et539i3,"I wanted to like this movie so bad but it just didn't do much for me. This felt more like episode 3 of a television series than a movie. It felt like they rushed a ton of it and half-assed some parts that could have made it really good. I liked Mysterio having a connection to Tony Stark but it was really weak at the same time ""I designed BARF but Tony made fun of it, rejected it, fired me, and called me CRAZY so I am crazy I guess,"" is what it felt like. I wish they added even more to show him being humiliated and ousted by Stark. Without someone like Gyllenhaal as the actor I think the character could have come off as awful. Marvel movies rely on the CGI action instead of strong and fulfilling dialogue in movies which I'm just tired of now. I really wish there was another emotional scene with Mysterio and Peter before his turn, and then the scene with Happy and Peter in the plane was better to really show that Happy could be the help Peter needs after Stark, not someone like Mysterio. Something to just add more depth and struggle to Peter after what should have been a huge event with Endgame. I didn't feel the impact.

&#x200B;

The final fight was extremely disappointing. Just Peter swinging around a bridge destroying drones. It was cool before the illusion was taken down but felt boring and generic after that. The final hallway was a great set-up for another illusion Peter would face but it was just a dark hallway that led to nothing really (the illusion that Mysterio gave Peter before he was hit by the train was amazing and the best scene in the movie I think). The humor was good but I think it was used as a crutch a bit too much to undermine some scenes that could have been emotional and compelling (yeah yeah Marvel does it a ton/broken record but I just wish it would stop).

eu1ugzw,"Movie was enjoyable, but pretty forgettable, Didn't seem like a genuine spider movie. Too many plotholes in my opinion

1. The whole thing with projectors just didn't sit well with me. Too many plotholes with relation to that.
2. I have no idea how Projectors could imitate touch. There is the case when Mysterio flys next to spiderman and sits next to him and has a conversation with him. I'm pretty sure he touched him, even if he didn't you would know if it was not a real person sitting next to you.
3. How can a projector blind the sun and make it seem like its pitch dark in mid day. As a far as science goes, you need a solid object to block  the sun .
4. The projector's don't have any hands, so when something actually takes hold of spiderman and throws him in some of the action scenes, what is holding him??
5. So Talos and Soren were as smart as Nick Fury and was able to see through all Mysterio's plans? That is not possible. That was a dumb reveal to me that it wasn't really nick all along
6. When Fury Picks him up and takes him and  then it is revealed it was Mysterio all along, So again spiderman never senses that the Fury next to him is a Projection? And that too with his spidey sense?
7. Did Mysterio also have the technology to imitate other people's voices, as that does not seem like something which could be readily available.

We didnt really get to feel any of this, or really explore it. I didnt feel sad about Tony, I didnt get why Peter liked MJ, I didnt feel the urgency of the Mysterio situation, etc. And the ""kid in high school"" tone of the movie did not work nearly as well as homecoming for me. On top of that, I thought the boat sequence and fire sequence were pretty underwhelming, just a bunch of particles flying everywhere and Peter shooting webs randomly 

Everything starting with the illusion sequence with Peter was good though. The visuals were great, the action worked well enough, and Fury's stuff was cool.

The mid credit scene was super hype, the after credit scene was cool enough, I dont really care that they were kree the whole time but it doesnt upset me either.

Overall, 6/10, an average plays-it-safe MCU film",c7xhmz

etf849c,"Thought the movie was all right, Mysterio reveal felt REALLY broadcasted and I really didn’t find Ned or MJ as likeable as before which was disappointing... Highlights were Peter running to hug Happy in the tulip field, and the trippy simulation sequence ending with Peter getting hit by a truck. 

Thought Fury was really unlikeable in this movie as well (most paranoid man on the planet doesn’t do a background check on Quentin Beck?) but I suppose that can be forgiven after end credits. Really curious as to what he’s up to TBH.

Also, really wondering if they’re going to do anything with the multiverse and Earth 616. I assume it was all lies by Beck but seriously hope it comes into play later. 

As a side note, Flash had his own little arc through the show. His texts asking his parents where they are, they haven’t talked to him in a while, made the later scene in the airport where he realizes neither of his parents showed up and simply sent someone more heartbreaking. I wonder what Marvel has planned for him??? #flashmob

&#x200B;

Problems I have:  


* Pretty much everyone and their Grandmother knows that Mysterio is a villain. Was everyone supposed to be under the impression that he was going to be a hero? Was this supposed to be a twist? The pacing felt so all over the place until the reveal.  

* Also - if Beck is supposed to be from another version of Earth then someone would have done background checks on him, come across his past at Stark industries and would have got suspicious?  

* Look I get that they're doing something different from the Raimi and godawful Sony films but I feel like they are slowly getting rid of all the small details about Spider-Man. The fact that Uncle Ben wasn't even acknowledged in the Mysterio visions is ridiculous. It's an overdone bit of the origin story but it shouldn't be ignored completely.",c7xhmz

Also I understand maybe a couple of people being upset with Tony, but there were **so many** ex-employees helping Beck...I have a hard time believing that many people would still be angry with him after 10+ years of being Iron Man.",c7xhmz
espv1r4,"I thought FFH was kinda meh tbh. 
I do have to say that I generally feel pretty checked out from the MCU as a whole after Infinity War and this movie mostly just cements that for me. 

Mysterio is the best part of the movie for me. I haven’t read as many comics for the marvel heroes as I have played video games for them so my first introduction to a lot of these characters (Mysterio included) are from them and the MCU’s feels like a faithful and fun to watch representation. 

That being said, the movie as a whole relies entirely too much on bait and switch for my liking. It’s fine to have a twist or two but when there’s so many happening all the time it just kind of numbs me and dulls any potential impact for any action or possible consequence. I get that it’s part of the character and I get that this movie kinda tried to go for that classic spider man disappointing hero reveal staple but it fell mostly flat for me. Mysterio and Spider man just never spend that much time together for it to really work for me. It doesn’t feel as believable here as it does in other stories including the recent PS4 spider man and doctor Octavius portrayal. Would’ve liked more of Mysterio and spider man considering Mysterio was the best part of the movie for me. 

I always complain about mcu humor so I won’t waste too much time on it here. It feels lazy, and overdone yet again and here it gets in the way entirely too much for my liking. Once the 7th stupid teacher gag happens and a potentially interesting scene of conflict gets interrupted by a lame joke for the 11th time I can just feel myself giving up on caring about anything. Humor is necessary for spider man but peter gets like one or two staple lines and the rest is just memes and jokes that fit better almost anywhere else but this movie. 

I didn’t like the random “oh I can’t use my spidey senses anymore oh wait now I can” contrivance. Usually that would be tied to some sort of distraction, emotional turmoil or feeling that spider man or some other hero or special power user is going through. But here they don’t tie it to him mourning iron man or being distracted by MJ or feeling resentful about being spider man, nothing. It just comes and goes. He can’t ever adapt during the first Mysterio FX drone attack but during the second he’s already got it back before he even starts. Just feels like a random contrivance than a cool character moment or journey. 

Another common complaint of mine but it’s one that really drains my interest is just how much the mcu is progressing to a bad comic structure where new tech pops out of nowhere or is forced into convenient positions constantly and every single individual movie feels much less important and impactful than the previous one. Doesn’t matter how cataclysmic the stakes, everything will be fine. Doesn’t matter what happens in the movie, the consequences that are inconvenient for the writers and plotters will get brushed aside as jokes and the consequences that could spawn new movies will be hyper expanded and the entire movie will reach heavily to make the connection. I felt like the MCU for a while was mostly better than that and that it could be more interesting and impactful than it is. 

Peter Parker’s journey here just felt like less than the sum of its parts. There’s 2 or 3 inherently interesting things going on with him that they could focus on but really they don’t give any much time. The scene with Happy on the plane was getting close for me but it ends almost as soon as it starts. Maybe I’m just getting old but I feel like none of these newer mcu movies really breathe anymore so to speak. Like they don’t give us adequate time to really feel what’s going on which is something homecoming did far better imo. 

I thought the score was lacking too which I was really disappointed by considering how much I enjoyed Homecoming’s score. I don’t understand what Giaccino’s obsession with out of place Gentle harp music during action scenes is but this is why he’s such a hit or miss composer for me. Movie could’ve used punchier tracks imo. 

The action scenes with the elementals are inherently meh because even if you don’t know who Mysterio is and you’re not in on the FX background you still don’t know what his supposed ‘powers’ are or what they do so when he’s shooting green mist at them it’s just like idk if he’s really struggling or not  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and the movie goes out of its way to say his effects are really ultra convincing but those don’t really work for me and spider man rarely ever shows creativity and ingenuity In his actions in this movie aside from the tower scene at the start and the bridge scene at the end. And fighting a thousand drones isn’t that visually interesting anyway. 

Overall just felt meh to me. All the elements were there but I felt like the execution was cheap and lacking and just not assembled well to begin with. The movie relies way too much on bait and switch and bad humor for my taste and not enough on really fleshing peter and his  between a rock and a hard place dilemmas our enough. Plus in the MCU like with bad comics it’s harder than ever to believe someone is really dead, something really did get destroyed, etc. 
It just feels like every movie resets perfectly at the end with some new random crap to tease the next one instead of actually progressing what’s already there. It’s harder and harder to care about these characters’ journeys and this cinematic universe as a whole when what follows through from movie to movie in a coherent way feels so artificial and arbitrary.

6/10 it was meh for me, not much there to enjoy and could’ve been executed a lot better. Kinda feels like the iron man 2 of the MCU spidey movies. Not as bad but still kinda similar to me.",c7xhmz

Nowhere near as much depth in his character compared to the way they handled Vulture. 

Everything else about the film was great (not counting the cheap drama and humor they did with Brad and Flash), and it would have been even better if Mysterio wasn’t a two-dimensional crazy Steve Jobs. 

The twist came too early in the film, and the instant reveal immediately telling us Mysterio & Crew’s backstory made the entire thing corny. Honestly, just keeping Mysterio’s comic backstory would be easier and more interesting.

Before the twist, Mysterio is a hero from another universe fighting elemental giants that can destroy worlds. After the twist, we learn he's not from another universe, and doesn't even have powers. He's just a disgruntled ex-employee of Stark using drones and holograms to trick people.

etw84yw,"My problem with the movie is that in the end Peter Parker never really has any kind of emotional breakthrough, and there is no sense that anything was lost for him in the movie. If it wasn't for the first post credit scene with his identity being revealed it would have been a pretty pointless movie imo. And I love Spider-Man.

With Homecoming Peter is told ""if you're nothing without the suit then you shouldn't have it"" and you get the uplifting scene of him getting out from under the rubble and it's a great moment for Peter Parker as a human - a person just like everyone else. Far From Home doesn't do that. There's the moment of Happy telling him that he doesn't need to be Iron Man, but in the end that's a Spider-Man problem, not a Peter Parker problem. The appeal of Peter Parker as a character is that anyone could be the hero, anyone could see themself as that innocent kid. If Peter Parker isn't developed as a character, why should anyone care about the story?

The movie does a lot of things really well, and as an action/superhero movie it's pretty good. But in terms of it's story, it really lets Peter Parker down. There needed to be more than just a post credit scene to carry the weight",c7xhmz
etx8pb9,"
Look, I didn’t hate it, and I laughed at the 40% of the jokes that seemed to actually be trying. But so much of this felt surprisingly lifeless, and I’m confident I could turn in a 3-slide PowerPoint pitch on Peter’s character development post-Endgame that could be a more compelling arc then the one he gets here. (That said, I actually liked the conflict of a teenager with a lot of responsibility but also a lot of desire to just hang and kiss and chill. That’s more interesting to me than “I’m not good enough to be Spider-Man,"" and I wish they’d deal more with the former). ",c7xhmz
esndu3w,"The first half was really just eh for me. There was that Adam Sandler-level joke where Peter gets walked in on with his pants off, the pacing was off and most of the humor outside of Martin Starr fell kind of flat.

ete1v7r,"Mysterio is a pretty solid villain overall but his exposition dump was really awkward. A lot of people guessed that he try to set himself up as Iron Man 2.0 and the elementals were illusions, but I think that worked. I'm kinda disappointed that both of Peter's villains are basically taking their grudges on Tony out on him, but it's somewhat redeemed by them establishing personal stakes with Peter along the way.


The Europe trip was an interesting idea for a New York hero and I think it let Peter get beat down to a whole new extent. By the time he gets sent to the Netherlands, he's totally defeated. It was like his version of the IM3 house attack, although Happy is a bigger help than Harley was to Tony. But the movie made it clear that this is about Peter coming into his own and driving him into the deepest of corners was the best way to create that. The warehouse scene was great (although how did Mysterio know about Pete's original suit?)


The whole drone things was kinda odd but I was okay with it because it's a very unsubtle battle over Tony's legacy. And I think those personal stakes are a good direction for the MCU going forward. I'm sure we'll get another universal threat soon in Phase 4 but for now it's good that these problems are grounded in the characters and their lives. Peter being a villain will be easily disproven as people said since the suit and Edith probably have recordings. But at the very least Peter's identity is out in the open and I'm sure that people in-universe will argue that if Mysterio knew Spider Man's true identity, maybe he was right about Spidey's motives too. Sadly I don't think we'll get anything addressing this until Spidey 3 and by then who knows how much in-universe time will pass. But I'd rather seen this than a random Galactus foreshadow.


Overall, I'm biased but I really liked this movie. Mysterio was a great way to show Peter's personal struggle even if he wasn't the best villain in a vacuum. Honestly it was a bit weird to see a relatively normal movie after the whole Endgame thing, part of me still can't believe the MCU is still going. But Phase 3 really knocked it out of the park for me and it upgraded a lot of these from ""good enough"" to outright ""good"", or sometimes better. This is a really nice finish for Phase 3.


Edit: after thinking about it some more, I'm not really satisfied where Peter's character is after this. They went hard on him claiming the Iron Man mantle but I was hoping that he'd be willing to shoulder that responsibility in his own way. He's unique among all the Avengers by being a literal child and the conflict between selfish desire and needing to be a hero takes on a different context if he's just a teenager. And the narrative doesn't even allow him to feel comfortable by adding the post credits plot twist. It doesn't really diminish my appreciation for the movie but I feel like there needs to be a clearer development of his mindset since it's already his second solo.",c7xhmz
eterroy,"Shoutout to the editors. Lots of comedically timed shots of facial expressions that got me chuckling. When Beck says the elemental is taking power from Earth's core, the camera focuses on Samuel Jackson as he makes this fucking face that just got me, and *then* he says the story is bullshit which got me even more. When Peter declares Brad a target and the camera immediately switches to a satellite in space launching the attack drones, that shit had me doubled over too.

Another example of this movie's dry comedy is the intro scene with the video announcements, with the comic sans font and the super JPEGed Vision pic, plus the performances from the anchors. Just a whole lotta cringe humour.

That stuff aside, the movie was really good. JK Simmons scene was awesome, and Spidey's identity getting revealed is a great cliffhanger and I'm really anticipating what happens next with that. Nick Fury being a Skrull was a neat little Captain Marvel 2 tease that doesn't add much to the movie but its a cool little twist.

It's insane how much Spiderman goes through in  this movie, dude just gets fucking ragdolled half the time. Hit by a train, hit by cars, falling off tall buildings, this guy's a trooper! The scene where he uses his Spidey sense to beat the illusions and fuck up all the drones was awesome. Love the Peter/Happy dynamic, all the scenes of them on the plane were awesome. I hope he's in the third film too.

Mysterio's a decent villain and I thought it was cool that he was the one who invented BARF, and the scientist guy was from Iron Man 1. Cool way to keep everything feeling connected. Mysterio is also a super intimidating villain and I liked that Spider-Man was perfectly equipped to deal with him, thanks to his Spider sense. Thor or Captain Marvel wouldn't have been able to handle the illusions like Spidey did. I assume Mysterio is dead but if he's not it'd be cool to see him in the Sinister Six or something.",c7xhmz
esmptjw,"The most surprising thing was that my theater got the Red Band trailer of Tarantino's once upon a time in hollywood before it started. I thought the wrong movie was gonna start for a sec or that I was in the wrong theater. All the kids were treated to that F-Bomb lol.

As for the movie, it's official. Peter's secret identity is the worst kept secret in the MCU. I think just maybe only Doctor Strange's identity is safe from the general public. I wonder if this all some kind of revenge against Tom for all the stuff he's spoiled lol. 

Sadly to say both Spidey movies are like ranked somewhere in the bottom for me. I got the same feeling I did after watching Homecoming. That I couldn't believe I think I'd liked TASM1 better and then when I saw Into the Spider-Verse, I couldn't believe Sony, of all companies, gave us a better movie than Marvel did with Homecoming and now lastly with this one, that Into the Spider-Verse is still better.

I think this movie shared one of it's problems with TASM2, too much romance. Feels like I was watching basically a DCOM of Spider-Man on Disney Channel instead. I still feel kinda bad for Liz Allen. I was totally ready for the focus to be on her because I thought it was gonna be like the show, Spectacular Spider-man, annnd she got written off to Oregon. I legit wonder if that was always the plan or a result of when Zendaya joined and accommodating her character instead. Who speaking of, I got nothing against her but calling her ""MJ"" was just a stupid a decision and reeks of last-minute BS and should been left as Michelle to differentiate from Gwen and MJ. That is all im saying because it was needles confusion and drama. I think I even remember Zendaya on a talk show saying she's no one unless she was ordered to lie. I did enjoy her ""MJ"" better here but I honestly can't see the appeal of her being the rumored Ariel either in a L/A Little Mermaid either.

It still kinda of sucks that Pete is just getting Tony's leftovers as villians but Mysterio was great, Jake did a good job. I do think this movie had its positives with 1 of them finally having Spidey swinging in NY. I think everyone has been waiting for that.

Disneys production values mean that even if plotting is childish, watching it in IMAX 3D is still stunning. The scenes with Mysterio's illusions were amazing, a genuine highlight for me.

I hope Gyllenhaal gets to reprise his role because he's a terrific actor and was great in this too. He has great range and can do sweet characters (Even though I know >!Misterio is a bad guy, he was kinda heartwarming as he was advising Peter Parker before the heel turn!<)as well as totally unhinged characters (I actually think he could be a great Joker after watching him in Nightcrawler).

esnrj17,"This quite honestly is the worst Spider-Man movie

Honestly wasn't that bad for the most part. It was average and even the romance with MJ wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be from how Homecoming did it (althogh it does feel incredibly rushed and I still don't buy her instantly knowing Peters identity but more on that later). Also the side characters themselves didn't feel nearly as bad, although that may be because I've finally managed to dissassociate them from the characters they take their names from and realize they're basically just original characters

I personally didn't like how they have made both of Spider-Mans villains tied to Stark, I would have preferred him to maybe be a thief who uses illusions to aid him in stealing certain macguffins from European Shield headquarters or even just a regular gem thief with a flair for egomaniacal drama rather than some guy who wants to be Iron Man.

And now my biggest gripe, and why it is auite literally the worst Spider-Man movie (even worse than ASM2). That is because it just fundamentally does not understand Spider-Man. Just like Civil War (the comic) before it fundamentally did not understand Spider-Man in revealing his identity. The Great Responsibility that Uncle Ben speaks of (which we have not had mentioned even once in the entire history of the MCU, but thats a nitpick) is not in reference to him just being a superhero, his great responsibility is that he can't let people know that he is a superhero as he has to protect those he cares about. The great responsibility is that he will get fired or yelled at for being lazy or late or tied when he was just saving the world or saving someones family or just being a hero. 

Its that he will never ever get credit for anything that he does or helps and it will only ever hurt him, but it is his responsibility to keep helping those who need help. And the post credits scene just complefely destroys any semblence of that in about 5 seconds, it destroys the entire core of who Spider-Man and Peter Parker are and if this continues will change Tom Holland from playing Spider-Man to generic YA Hero #5. There is nothing left at the core of this character, on all levels except name, Spider-Man is dead. If they had left it at Spider-Man being seen as a villain that would have even been clever and good, but with those last 5 seconds, they ruin the MCUs Spider-Man permanantly in my eyes

And that is why it is the absolute worst Spider-Man film and why anyone who claims to be a Spider-Man fan probably understands the character as much as Zack Snyder understands Batman and Superman.

Also the scene where he just gives him the glasses... that scene just felt like a deleted scene or something. like it was a bad cut. other then that... starting to feel over the marvel movies. burnt out/overkill/bleh.

esk6htg,"Was kind of bored during the first half. I knew a heel turn was coming and wasn’t really engaged. A lot of the humor reminded me of the worst jokes in Homecoming, and it’s a shame so much of the teen banter is so forced, since the teen interactions outside of the main characters are really genuine and fun (Flash getting a tapper took me back to high school).

Once they finally got to the turn though, holy shit. They used Mysterio to his full potential. Gyllenhaal’s performance went from bland to hilarious. His expository monologue in the bar is great. Him fretting about his cape is great. Him being fed lines was great. Mysterio was great. I also love the stuff with Happy at the end, and the mid credits scene was perfect. JK is back, and nyc hates spider-man.

I am a little hesitant about the name reveal though. To me, the character of Spider-Man (more than other heroes) is all about the balance of his normal life and his hero life, and the sacrifices he has to make. Apparently those two lives are now converged, and I’m nervous how it’s going to change the character.

- **Too many Avengers references**: Listen, it's nice and all, but I wish they were more subtle like in the previous films, there was a reference to them coming up every 10 - 15 minutes, the movie can try to hype people up, but it doesn't work on me.
- **Stark Tech ruins Spider-Man**: Spider-Man has access to overpowered shit now and pretty much now needs zero of his own science skills to do anything now... okay I guess...
- **Relationship with Discount Mary Jane is kinda cute... but weird and rushed at the same time**: Nothing much to add here besides to ask the question why Peter gets his web-shooter up for MJ all of a sudden, he gave 0 shits about her in the last movie now he starts talking about his love for her in the first moment of the movie... felt like it could have done better.
- **First half of the movie feels more like a near boring teenage love drama then a proper Spider-Man film**: It feels pretty down to Earth in the first half I'll give it that, but things get better once Mysterio unveils his true intentions, the best parts imo were when Mysterio messes around with Peter for the first time with the AR and J.J.J. showing up in the end. But, I hated how Peter's identity was revealed to everyone at the end, which really ruined it. Overall/**TL;DR**, it takes a while for the movie to start to pick up but eventually gets into some good stuff.

So yeah, there were only a handful of parts I enjoyed (which I pointed out to some above). But that was my feelings about the movie, I know some will disagree but hopefully some would understand where I'm coming from. Thanks for reading!",c7xhmz

esus5mb,"Edit: Also, did anyone get some Incredible vibes off the plot?

Enjoyed the film, but it doesn’t really stand out imo from the other MCU films - it’s a typical good vs bad cityscape plot, nothing new really I think it’s fair to say?

Although I love this new light hearted Peter Parker, I do kinda wish there’s more of a serious tone in some points, whilst maintaining the light heartedness in other scenes, just to change things up a bit and make the character development a bit more pronounced. For e.g., all the collateral damage and deaths that would have resulted from Peter giving up those glasses were glossed over a bit, they could have done something there maybe (or not idk, would just like to see a more mature performance in 1 or 2 scenes like we saw in Infinity War/Endgame).

I also feel like that post-bar scene was a little unnecessary - I think the deception would have been easy enough to guess if they relied on subtle hints and details more. I would have preferred it if they kept us guessing as to what Mysterio’s true motive is, and maybe made it a bit harder to deduce than ‘oh here’s a projector’ or actually just stating it as they did in the bar scene. Loved the Teachers though, and I wish there was less focus on the drones, and more in Mysterio himself. I also reckon Spidey could have come up with some radar-assisted visual overlay or something to get past the illusions, but in the end it did give us that awesome action sequence at the end through the spidey sense.

All in all, I’d give it a 7/10 probs, which is by no means bad. Just wished they did a bit more with it.

So why is he chilling in space when a guy on Earth has control over ALL OF STARK’s TECHNOLOGY? Isn’t that a threat? Should Fury care a little more?

Some notable things/questions:

\- When Peter asked Nick Fury whether other superheroes are available and mentioned Captain Marvel, Fury responded with ""Don't even mention her name"". I thought that was weird, but after it was revealed that Fury was Talos, that was really smart foreshadowing.

\- The scene when Quentin Beck wore the glasses really sells the ""the next Iron Man/Tony Stark"" thing because Gyllenhaal looks a bit like Downey. I think that's one of the reasons why they picked him for this role.

\- So if everything is just an illusion and prerecorded, does it mean that the village in Mexico and other places are never really destroyed? I mean, surely after Beck and Fury and Hill left the scene, there will be other SHIELD agents deployed to monitor and guard the scene of the incident? And unless Beck's drones stay there for a long time, surely some people will realize that it's just an illusion?

\- In addition to the point above, the scene with Beck flying over to the roof to check on Peter is weird as well. He can't have recorded that conversation before right? And if it's not recorded, how did he fly over to the roof?

\- In the end, there's this weird scene where Flash asked his butler/whatever where his mom is. Not sure what it is but definitely teaser for the sequel.

\- If Fury is Talos, how did he know the coded message from Happy?

\- I don't actually care for the post credit scene where Fury's leading the Skrulls in the space. Don't really like Captain Marvel's Superman-esque battle scenes where she just flew around destroying huge ships. I mean, they surely have to nerf her by taking away her power or something for her second movie to work, right?

Tom Holland again shows that he is a great actor in the making. He nailed every emotional scenes with his watery eyes.",c7xhmz

eth9kfs,"Just saw it.

1. Only saw the first trailer. Haven't read the comics. So, went into the film fairly unspoiled.

2. The Beck/Mysterio twist was unexpected and clever. Well done on the studio keeping that out of the trailer. For me, that reveal was one of the two best scenes in the film.

3. Most of the characters felt flat. Didn't feel a sense of urgency or that anyone was in real danger (later found out why). Beck's character showed the most emotion, so, connected with him more than the others.

4. Ned's comedic relief didn't work in this film compared to Homecoming. His romantic interest was weak and felt out of place.

5. Those two chaperone teachers. Mr. Harrington was annoying and not needed. Mr. Dell should've been the only teacher. His performance and comedy felt natural.

6. Didn't care about the other students (except for Peter and Brad). Didn't feel they added anything to the story line. Yes, not even MJ.

7. Peter and Brad's rivalry was well done and hilarious. It was fun to see their relationship go back and forth. Disappointed their conflict didn't tie up at the end of the film. I see why MJ was needed for their conflict to work, but, she still felt like a third wheel.

8. Genuinely enjoyed Happy Hogan. His performance felt natural. Loved that moment when he sees Peter on the plane channeling ""Tony"" while constructing a new suit. Second best scene and a very cool moment. It suddenly felt like a Marvel film. 

9. Even though we find out about Fury and Hill later in the film, both of their performances felt flat. Felt no sense of emergency from either of them. Frankly, they acted like this wasn't a Marvel superhero film compared to the first Avengers and Winter Soldier.

10. The reality-bending sequences Beck did on Peter was cool and trippy as all get out. Totally bought into Peter's exclamation to Happy when he came to pick Peter up in that tulip field. I, too, wasn't sure what was real or still an illusion.

Overall, I give this a 6 out of 10. Far From Home was good, but, it was far from being great.",c7xhmz
esm8vvk,I liked that this movie did a good job of showing how Tony kind of stunted Peter's growth as Spiderman. By giving him the rich tech suit Peter didn't have to rely on his own skills as Spiderman as much. He didn't need the Peter tingle because his suit handled that for him. He started to do it on his own when his web shooters went out and he had to fight with just the strength (holding the car door) and his agility. Then using his tingle to stop actual Mysterio from shooting him. Well done.,c7xhmz
esmk73j,"I usually just enjoy the MCU without thinking about it too much, but for some reason I couldn’t help but be critical of it this time.

et0z4pd,"With its super fun action scenes, simpler story, and effective humor, S-M: FFH is better than Homecoming in almost regard.

I really like how this film’s narrative feels like the logical progression of the Marvel universe. From Mysterio’s comments about public perception to Thor being studied in physics, this universe is both fully realized and fleshed out. In many ways this film is Marvel critiquing their own narratives. One can easily draw parallels between how movies are made and how Mysterio manipulates the public. Both use smoke and mirrors...literally.

As previously mentioned, the direction was confident and engaging. The humor didn’t rely solely on the dialogue and had some physical humor (which I really appreciated). And the scene with zombie Iron Man was easily the best within the film. Said sequence was reminiscent of the best parts within Dr. Strange.

Unfortunately once Mysterio’s motives are revealed, the film simply isn’t as fun. Awkward exposition dump aside, the mechanics of it all makes no god damn sense. Granted, this is a problem within most Marvel films, but this movie explains too much while explaining too little. The deeper the film explains Mysterio’s actions, the more contrived they become (from a logical perspective). Can other people see zombie Iron Man? Did Mysterio’s team map out each location? Why not just do said projections in an open field? What if someone tries to interact with Mysterio while he’s a projection?

Also, can someone please explain to me the logic behind the blip? I’m hoping I missed something because I’m really baffled by the idea that those who came back from the blip aged an additional 5 years. Doesn’t it make more sense for those vanished people not to age or did I understand this incorrectly?

Overall, I would rather see Spider-Man fight Mysterio rather than fight drones. I feel like Mysterio’s backstory could have been simplified and reworked a bit, thus strengthening the film’s premise.

B+ for me. Tons of fun, but turn your brain off before walking into the theater.",c7xhmz

esk8bma,"Just got out of an IMAX midnight showing. Far From Home is the best Spider-Man film since Spiderman 2.

* To everyone who keeps thinking comic book movies are done, this is a rude awakening. FFH feels fresh, unique, charming and sweet. Whatever sorcery Marvel is doing to keep these movies be so good so consistently, I hope they keep doing it.
* Speaking of sorcery, Jake Gyllenhall's Mysterio is perfect as the man behind the curtain villain. He is so convincing as the good guy that even though you know a turn is coming, you are along for the ride.
* The story is engaging and feels light in spite of its weight. Not one minute feels boring from the opening shot to the final scene.
* The movie's re-watch value shows. There are subtle hints about the surprises in store, like when Fury says, ""Beck is from Earth, just not yours..."" Cannot wait to go back and find more of these.
* Peter tingle, Night Monkey, J Jonah Alex Jones ... I can see the memes already. 
* Every suit works perfectly in the movie! Very subtly and elegantly, at the end of the movie, the spider suit ditches its original red and blue, and I loved it! Always forward, forward always.
* The train yard/Spidey nightmares scene is my favorite scene in the movie. It is my second favorite scene this year, after Portals from Endgame,
* That ending! What the f--?!

Go go Spidey go! Bring on the sequel. My guess? The title will be Spider-Man: Home No More",c7xhmz
estrbx0,"Villain is literally Syndrome from The Incredibles, lol

Illusion looked too much like Spider-man games...",c7xhmz
estxtlq,"Well it was good. However, not nearly as good as the critic hype make it look like. It was just a competently executed superhero movie but it's nothing exceptional (even less for Spider-Man). I see this as a trend more and more with MCU movies sadly (hi Captain Marvel), critics should not be fanboys.

So my point in a messy list : 

* Action was really good and far superior to Homecoming which was a little lacking in that sense. However, it was a lot less personal and down with Peter if that makes sense. Though the more visually impressive Spidey movie to date for sure. Loved the scene when the illusion go crazy in Germany (remind me of Arkham Scarecrow sequences). Kind of easy that Spidey can just use the spider sense to see through them perfectly though.

* MJ was better than in the first movie especially when she learned Peter was Spidey, she kind of shed of cringy personality and that's all the better, may it never come back.

* The romance was kind of weird between the two, it was well executed and everything but Peter just like her in the beginning of the movie while he didn't show any sign of it in Homecoming. Also, btw, I'm still kind of disapointed that the MCU (the more true to comics version normally) ignore Gwen Stacy for MJ as his first love (well his second I guess)

* J Jonah Jameson played by JK Simmons was great, loved that he has an Infowars style website, clearly better than a newspaper for him nowadays. However, still no Osborn hint, a little disapointed (what about that ex-Avengers tower ? We could have seen it with Oscorp logo when he swings in the city)

* Mysterio twist was seen from 10 miles away if you knew who he was. If you didn't, I guess it could have worked as it was well executed. Kind of disappointed that the multiverse thing (but hey that's who Mysterio is so that's fine) wasn't real, hope it doesn't mean it won't appear now.

* Speaking of Mysterio, he looks more like an Iron Man villain than a Spidey one with his tech and origin now. Doesn't make Peter less Iron Boy I guess (the rest of the movie doesn't either). 

* Is he dead ? The world and Peter seems to think so (btw Peter doesn't seem to flinch to have killed someone, he's supposed to avoid that at all costs). The reveal at the end and him being Mysterio (plus Sinister Six plans) probably means the death is faked though, wouldn't be hard to explain with him.

* The idendity reveal, I don't know what to think. In a way, secret identity are not a thing in the MCU and I find them kind of boring but it was nice to have ONE superhero which had one. But considering that basically all important characters know it now (and that Peter is really not careful with it !), it probably isn't that big of a deal. Also not sure how people will believe this because Mysterio deal with illusion is known right ? (people saw the fake elemental). But then why say a random kid (and if you actually do research on him, it's pretty obvious, without counting all the people that Peter is around).",c7xhmz

My only complaint is that this isn't really Spider-Man. It's a weird amalgamation made out of Spider-Man ideas from over the years, some good and some not, but it's sort of an entirely new creation based on the mythos...and probably my least favorite of all of them, somehow.

eskbe3x,"This movie really delivered. It had a real feel-good vibe throughout and felt bright and poppy throughout. Once again the Spider-Man movie was real low-key and really got to show how the world is in the MCU especially post-Blip (movies about heroes on the airplane, it being called the Blip, how Iron Man's death effected the world). I hope the next one is just as grounded. 

Spidey himself was great. They really made the push to make him his own hero, not the next Iron Man necessarily, but the next Spidey. Totally felt like that since he was the one making **his own** suit. I think the action reflected that perfectly too. Peter uses his smarts to get out of his situation. He literally MacGyver's his way out after his web shooters stop working. And he **finally** fully embraces his Spider Sense (its been a long time coming and him destroying the robots and dodging that bullet was quite the payoff). The action at the end finally improved the more held back MCU Spider-Man we've gotten used to, a real step up!

Mysterio was really great too. Dude was just as jackass and full of himself as he should be. The illusion scene was a perfect Spidey moment. It really felt straight out of the comic. Also Zombie Iron Man was crazy (Closest thing to Marvel Zombies we'll ever get). Also the fishbowl was in full effect even down to becoming a snow globe and Spidey being trapped in there. I was so happy Spidey got the usual break the fishbowl with a punch moment at the end. 

The romance was also really great! I was really rooting for it! It was so adorable and felt high school-y.

Alright, I gotta talk about the fan service tho. JK Simmons is fucking back baby! (and with a new hair style). Spidey finally swings through NY! The costume scene had a bunch (OG Iron Spidey, Bulletproof Spidey, **I think** the PS4 one). Lil things about the world of course. The post credits scenes were also real big game changers in a different way than I expected. I'm really excited for what's next for Peter. 

Overall, it was a great movie and lots of fun. Had a real high school vibe to it, and that made it better! Characters were great, villain was awesome, and the Spidey action finally is picking up. I will admit it isn't very close imo to beating Spider-Man 2 as best live action Spider-Man but that isn't to say its a bad Spider-Man movie. Just an overall fun time!",c7xhmz

Spider-Man: Far From Home beings all the (current) MCU story home. It is the perfect Summer date movie. With enough twist and turns to make your head spin, you'll feel like the mighty web crawler in action.
         
Pros     
Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Holland once again prove their stellar acting. Their on screen chemistry is a force that will even make Star Wars rethink their script writing. 
        
Cons    
Some focal plot points could have better execution and the love triangle doesn't make the story better. Some scenes feel rushed or drastically overwhelm the viewer with too much to take in at once.

et7ngbh,"Enjoyable movie that had some good old fashion Marvel comedy stuff. However the villain wasn't that great (a problem for most Marvel movies, to be fair) and the action scenes seemed kinda off. It was often difficult to see what exactly was happening. On top of that, Spiderman fighting a bunch of small drones doesn't really make for a dynamic enough action scenes.

&#x200B;

Thumbs up to the acting from all involved and for the storyline managing to keep both the main plot AND the dating sub plot alive throughout the entire movie in a good way.

Let’s see we got the spider-man unveiling, Peter feels more comfortable in his role as an Avenger and now Peter will be public enemy #1? Well I guess that’s a lot but still, it felt like an episode of TV as opposed to a movie, if that makes any sense. 

The Mysterio scenes were really cool! It was everything I was hoping for when I learned that Mysterio would be the villain. I really liked Jake Gyllenhaal’s performance as well, his motive was kinda lame but overall he was great, hope he returns! 

I also really liked the parallels we got with Peter and Tony, when Pete was building his suit and also “I love Led Zeppelin!” got me haha.

et6thml,"I was a bit confused when Nick replied to Peter's inquiry about Captain Marvel with ""don't invoke her name"" in the manner he did because last we saw they were on good terms and it did not make sense for Nick to have that negative reaction to her. And it stayed in the back of my head until the after credits when the truth was revealed and then it made sense because while the skrulls did end up on good terms with her, they still already had years of being hunted by her and her team and that won't fade away that easily. Gotta give them credit for that subtle foreshadowing right there. 

That said, while the ""Peter tinkle"" (for I definiy heard tinkle not tingle) bit was funny, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with Spider-man movies in general. They seem to go out of their way to NOT give us the iconic lines and concepts. Like, when was the last time we got the actual ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line? That's right, last time it was actually said was back on the Raimi films, and that was back in 2002...17 freaking years and every incarnation since has gone out of their way to not say it and give us a variation instead. And now we don't even get spider sense, its peter tinkle. C'mon. At some point it starts being insulting.

Still loved the movie. Not sure where they are going with revealing Peter's identity. I could see them setting him up to take the blame for the attack and start the ""he is a menace"" thing (great they had the REAL JJJ again btw, there is nobody else in my mind that owns that role), but putting his identity out there like that seems like an odd choice. Hope they don't write themselves into a corner one more day style. Too big a step to try and fix with anything but a hand wave.",c7xhmz
eta53cm,"So in Homecoming: Michael Keaton's guy is an honest man trying to make a living my cleaning up New York post Avengers. Tony stark shuts it down, seizes all the materials, putting him out of business and he becomes the vulture using the same technology. 

In this movie Beck is someone who used to work for Tony stark, developed a technology which ultimately got  him fired  and he later becomes Mysterio using the same technology.  

Both movies, very similar villians with similar backgrounds.

Would have liked if Mysterio's reasons fro doing what he does had something to do with Endgame or even Infinity War. Curious to know if he was bliped, because if he or others or any of their family was, then Iron man sacrificing himself to bring them back surely would be a good reason to not take ""revenge""

Also, I know this is supposed to a fun movie after the intense Endgame, but i kinda hoped that Spider man, post endgame would have ""matured"" a bit. Having being part of the biggest battle he will ever fight, and to see his second father figure die in front of him, should have some effect on him, other than the occasional sad scene we see of him sitting quietly. I would have liked if he had no intention of pursuing MJ as he was still grieving Iron Man's death, decides to give up being Spider man forever and then is forced to be a hero again. I know they did a variation of the latter, but it was just i'm taking a break from being Spiderman than giving it up.

Also, it was the Skrull Fury who gave Parker the glasses, which i assume he got from the real fury. Spy like Fury would never give something like that to a kid, without knowing what it is. Would have preferred if Happy gave it to Iron man.

And finally, when did Stark get the time to develop EDITH (funny acronym) and if he had it, why not use it during Endgame battle. Sure the drones would have come in handy in the final  battle. Just stick the gauntlet on one of the drone and fly it away. Think this is highly inconsistent.",c7xhmz
etfydsr,"***This whole comment is full of spoilers and I can't tag everything. Collapse it if you don't want to be spoiled!***

**SPOILERS START NOW**

I have to admit that upon the reveal that Mysterio isn't real at all, and all just smoke and mirrors, I was a little skeptical. While I ""knew"" Mysterio wasn't going to be a good guy for long (I suspected he was a villain or was going to die), I didn't like the idea of handwaving such an important character as just being fake. However, it was an absolutely brilliant twist basically having the villain actually be a group effort to make up a superhero story; it isn't totally original -- many children's shows have similar plots for a single episode -- but I've never seen it executed so well.

It also presented an interesting issue: the whole plot seemed so overly-aggrandized and generic up until the big reveal (saving the world, titans, alternate universes, really?), but it's totally understandable because it was, in-universe, made up by somebody trying to emulate the things they saw happening in the real world. If I were a supervillain trying to make up a threat for our hero, I'd probably pull a lot of the same tropes.

All in all, it was a very interesting movie and a joy to watch. Spiderman's battles only get more and more intense and dynamic as the films go on, and this one's focus on his Spider-Sense was particularly unique. I can't wait to see where they go next.

However, the first half was extremely boring to me and for lack of a better description it was too cliche, corny, and as someone else described it rom-com. I'd probably say that the movie became good once the water elemental showed up, but the scene on the bus came after that and that was arguably my least favorite part of the entire movie. Overall, I still have a positive opinion of the movie because the second half was just that good. I would like to share what I think would've made the first half better though:

The movie still begins with Fury meeting Beck followed by the Marvel logo, school news broadcast and Peter telling Ned he's into MJ. Instead of the charity scene, replace that with the scene of Spider-Man beating up thugs and telling the cops he'll be out of town for a bit which was shown in the trailer. Follow this up with Peter packing at home and Aunt May comforting him about his spider sense not working correctly. Peter gets on the plane, they land and go to Venice where he fights the elemental and meets Beck. Fury still tricks the class into getting on the bus to Prague, but the bus scene is short and briefly explains the glasses, EDITH, and drones. 

Get rid of half the jokes, keep the better ones like the marching band reappearing after The Blip, Flash respecting Spider-Man but trashing Peter when he walks into the room, and Ned dating Betty. Remove Brad completely.",c7xhmz

It felt kind of slow at times, stuck in Austrian alpes and doing accidental drone attacks and so on, felt like we got a little too much comedy without really moving the story along. These superhero movies are far from realistic but this was kind of next level, Mysterio really takes a non serious mind to grasp, it's truly on the brink of lunacy, technology so ridiculous it goes from sci fi to star wars to harry potter but hey whatever. Overall the movie Just kind of felt a little lacking in stakes, maybe due to it being positioned post Endgame, but it just felt a little stale, not very dramatic. Some dialogue was iffy too, VFX was a bit of a hit or miss here and there, the action looked really rubbery at times and wasn't very spectacular, the CG spider-man suits looks pretty fake.   


Postives:  The actors were good, it was a good teenage drama in general, some funny comedy, and a nice way of developing Peter's story, his arc was a smart/good approach. But compared to Homecoming - which I think is the best MCU movie with Infinity War, it was a stepdown.",c7xhmz

esog32a,"I'm developing a fan theory. It's a bit of a stretch, but hear me out:

Both Spiderman movies have villains that are obsessed and/or angry with Tony Stark. Those villains have plans that involve stealing Stark technology. At the end of FFH, we see a guy downloading the hologram program from a computer to an external hard drive and taking it. If this person was one of Quentin's associates, we would've seen his face. The fact that they kept his face hidden means this will be an important reveal later on. I believe this is a person that has been hidden in the shadows, recruiting and helping people who are angry with Tony, and basically turning them into supervillains in order to get Stark technology. Think about it. It makes no sense that a cleanup company would be able to build an exo-skeleton capable of flight like the Vulture suit, as well as all the rest of their equipment (the shocker gloves, etc). They wouldn't know how to use Chitauri technology and turn it into something like that by themselves. Who has the knowledge to build suits like that? Who is angry enough with Tony that he would recruit other people who hate Tony? Who would be angry enough with Tony that they'd even go after his sidekick? In the after-credit scene for [Homecoming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iutGJV8t1_I), we see Scorpion saying he's got a ""voice on the outside"" who would love to kill Spiderman. 

I believe this is Justin Hammer. 

&#x200B;

My theory is that Justin Hammer is creating a Sinister Six-type organization (since the rights to some of those characters still belong to Sony, the MCU would have to make up something else) in order to take down Stark. Or at least that was the plan before he died in Endgame. His plan now is probably to destroy the image of Stark as a hero, by going after his protege. Which is why they gave Peter's identity to the Daily Bugle.",c7xhmz

etpz9i7,"I really don’t get how anyone who reads Spider-Man comics or claims to be a fan of the character can enjoy this interpretation. Peter has been in FIVE films now and we haven’t even gotten a mention of Uncle Ben? Seriously? For anyone who’s going to say “But we’ve seen him die so many times already!” Okay? Do it like Spectacular Spider-Man. Have Peter and Aunt May talk about him in passing, have it be a serious conversation. Or do a flashback of a powerful moment between them so we can see how that relationship has affected him to this day. It’s just inexcusable how Ben’s death, the biggest event in Peter’s life up until him fully becoming a hero hasn’t even been truly mentioned. And it frustrates me. Aunt May has been reduced to a sexualized joke. All she’s there to do is look pretty and get hit on. Marisa Tomei has the acting ability. Why not actually fucking use her? Why is she so okay with a 16 year old kid fighting murderers and aliens? Why did we get no follow-up or addressing of her finding out in Homecoming? Are we just supposed to buy that she’s accepted it with no fight? I won’t get into the character changes that I dislike because I know I’ll be made fun of for those, but they feel unnecessary. No Gwen Stacey, no real Mary Jane, they turned Betty Brant into a high school student, Jameson into an Alex Jones type who knows Peter is Spider-Man.... And that gets me into my final gripe. Why would you reveal his identity this early? That’s one of the biggest aspects of the character, Peter having to choose his superhero life over his normal one. Watching himself disappoint his friends and family over and over again because of his secret, because of his promise to Uncle Ben, himself, and the city of New York. And now that’s ruined. Everyone knows his secret. He’ll never be able to live normally or face that personal life struggle again. I know people will disagree but this doesn’t feel at all like Spider-Man. I don’t see how any fan of this character can be okay with what the MCU has done with him. I get being open to new interpretations but there are SPECIFIC aspects of the character that always need to be there for it to be a good adaptation. What is Superman without the Clark Kent persona? Batman without the Bruce Wayne playboy persona? It’s just.... not okay. And I may consider checking out, because I hate seeing what’s being done to my favorite superhero ever",c7xhmz
eso804c,"After Avengers: Endgame ended things pretty conclusively, there was uncertainty to how the Marvel Cinematic Universe would continue from Spider-Man: Far from Home onwards. Starting right after the events of Endgame, Far From Home explains exactly what happens when things went back to normal and focusing on Peter Parker getting back into his high school life again. Similar to Homecoming, Far From Home focuses a great deal on character development and scenes with Peter Parker and his friends more than the actual Superhero action stuff. I liked how the movie deals with the absence of a specific character and everyone trying to move on and get on with their lives. In a way, it acts more like an Epilogue to Endgame in that regard, but make no mistake this is a Spider-Man movie with some good humour and emotion that connects everything nicely.

Far From Home is essentially a road trip movie mixed with Superhero stuff. Peter Parker and his friends go on a school trip to various locations with some personal shenanigans and issues happening as subplots. Peter bumps into a new Superhero named Mysterio, which Jake Gyllenhaal performs a rather hammy and charismatic role in it. He's definitely one of the best things going for Far From Home. I do have some issues with how his ""Powers"" exactly work and nobody else seems to find any flaws with him or his technology, but he does give us some interesting fights and visuals for a Marvel movie. There were definitely parts that looked cool from him and without spoiling it his motivations are a bit of a twist and spin on the usual Marvel Superheroes stuff we've seen so far.

As for the other characters, Peter's best friend Ned is being his usual jokey self now tied to a new Romance subplot making things awkward for Peter, who is trying to win over MJ throughout the school trip. You really feel for Peter and him trying to connect with his other friends awkwardly while also having to juggle with his Spider-Man self. Peter continues to make sure he is never revealed to be Spider-Man, although it takes quite alot of suspension of disbelief that he takes off his mask in European towns and cities with not a single person noticing his real identity. Nick Fury and Happy Hogan get a good amount of screentime here too, and they both have nice little interactions with Peter Parker and his friends, and there's some good moments in the after-credits sequences worth watching too.

Some problems I have with Far from Home is that it does feel a bit on the long side. Alot of the road trips changing locations that so happen to conveniently work out for Peter and his buddies feel a little far-fetched (Yes I am aware ""Nick Fury"" does set some of these up on purpose, but I still feel it's a bit too coincidental in places) and some of the logic and possible plot holes that are present are hard to ignore and you start thinking ""Why didn't that character just do that?"" or ""How did they not notice at all?"" which can be a little distracting and making you question if it made any sense. Some of the jokes don't land too well and there's definitely a sense of retreading old ground a bit here and there. The visuals are mostly great, but there's a few that look a bit iffy. The music is fine, most of the acting is solid, and yeah it's good Post-Endgame start for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall, Spider-Man: Far from Home was decent, but nothing amazing for Marvel in my opinion. 6.5/10",c7xhmz
etnlgcm,I’m not going to lie I am not some superhero move nerd and literally came into this movie not watching Avengers or Spider-Man. I will even go far thinking the new Spider-Man looked cheesy and thought the whole new cast was just cringe. But man I was actually impressed with the acting. Holland wasn’t amazing but he was good. I really liked the characters from that kid Ned who is actually funny as fuckabd I thought him and that white girl dating throughout the movie was hilarious as fuck. Gylenhall is a beast like always. Always been cool with his work. He just does his shot and he nails hit. IDK what I missed other than Iron man dying in endgame but honestly don’t really care. I worried I wouldn’t  understand but I enjoyed the film even with spoilers. IDK if I will watch the Spider-Man homecoming or endgame but I would watch another Spider-Man if there is one. It really is simple and just fun. Not the best film ever nuff a good superhero film that actually had a good plot. I figured Gylenhall was a bit shady but they still did a good on with it.,c7xhmz

Hawkeye takes a deskjob and might take over as head of New Avengers along with Rhodey and they focus on Earth based problems including training some hot 20 somethings in some Disney+ teen drama.

If so then what's next for Peter & why the Skrulls were pretending to be Maria Hill & Nick Fury where as Nick Fury was up in space? Also I didn't expect MJ to figure out that Peter was Spiderman, I mean that actually surprised me.

I know I know it's just a movie but it gets to the point where other films need to fact check and error proof every scene otherwise critics trash their films but marvel can have shape shifting aliens take over whoever's convenient and have multiple stark crew plot against him with no one from stark industries to nick fury finding out and critics dont fault the films at all.

Also like that the villains so far in these movies have been similar to Spider-Man in the way that they seem like real people with problems and motivations and not super villains just evil for the sake of it. Also funny that Iron-Man was partially responsible for both of Spider-Man’s villains so far.

Back when Spider-man: Homecoming first released I recalled that fans were pissed that After the Intro with the Vulture cleaning the mess left after the Battle of New York in the  first Avengers Movie, there is a time skip to 8 years later. I recalled fans being pissed because that would mean Captain America Civil War takes place 8 years after the first Avengers Movie since Spider-man: Homecoming takes place 2 months after Captain America Civil War. If that wasn't enough Peter Parker is 15. In Avengers Infinity War, Avengers Endgame, and the most recent Spider-man: Far From Home, Peter Parker is 16. That would mean the gap between Civil War and Infinity War could only be a year apart at best. If that's not bad enough, in Avengers Infinity War, Rhodey, when talking Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, Vision, and Wanda, he says ""It must have been a rough couple of years"" suggesting its been a couple of years between Civil War and Infinity War. With all of that stated, someone please try and make the timeline make sense again.

eso05ea,"Bit of a hot take here but I feel like this is definitely one of the bottom 3 marvel movies. Literally nothing happens the first hour and a half of the movie. The acting and script are really really bad with some of the worst dialogue and delivery I've seen in a Marvel movie. There's no Spiderman action, or even villain almost at all until the very end.

The majority of the movie was a will they-won't they between Spiderman and MJ, but like it's MJ, we already know they're going to get together, so all of their scenes were just awkward beating around the bush that were hard to watch. MJ and Peter have zero chemistry, with the only reason Peter seems to like her is that she's a total weirdo and is a personified ""I'm not like those OTHER GIRLS"" persona.

The writing overall was astonishingly weak. The elementals thing was so boring. Characters say and do weird illogical things that don't make sense for their characters, only because the plot needs them to and the writers couldn't figure out how to do it naturally. There wasn't really any character development between Peter and his classmates because his best friend fucks off immediately and the only other person from school we know is the bully, who just acts the same way he always does, but is somehow more insufferable. Like are we all going to ignore the whole bar scene where Spiderman realizes Tony Stark's wording that he's not supposed to be the next Iron Man, but is supposed to choose, but like that's not at all what he meant, because by the end Spiderman does get that torch passed over as confirmed by the jet scene? Like the movie just says and does things only to further the plot without any thought behind it. 

The comedy with the two teachers was so bad. For example, the whole JB Smoov and witches thing wasn't really funny the first time, and they did the joke two more times just for good measure.

I know the plot twists near the end kind of explain why some of these issues are the way they are, but honestly I don't think that matters. I was bored out of my mind the whole movie with the dumb and honestly nonsense elementals plot, and the fact that it was all supposed to seem dumb and not a good story isn't going to retroactively make me enjoy that part of the movie.

I saw this opening night in a huge theater and I've never seen this lack of a response towards a marvel movie. The movie got maybe 5 total laughs, and several people actually walked out. Which is a shame because the last half hour was actually very, very good.",c7xhmz
esnc6cp,"\*SPOILERS\* (Obviously)

&#x200B;

\- Honestly, the writing could have been better. There were so many corny one liners that made me cringe like when Brad Davis spotted Mysterio and said something along the lines of ""look it's Mysterio!"". It was just something quite obvious that HAD to be pointed out by an irrelevant character. 

\- The CGI in this film was fantastic except for the one scene when Happy flies in with a plane to pick up Peter from the flower garden. The green screen was quite obvious and someone clearly got lazy. The crew filmed in multiple countries and you're telling me they couldn't just film a simple scene in a garden? They had to use a green screen for that?

\- One loose end I noticed was towards the end during the downfall of Mysterio, the computer guy on the team downloaded the drone software onto a USB drive....the movie never followed through with this. Not even in a post-credit scene.

\- Where was Vulture and Scorpion? We had a post-credit scene with them in Homecoming. Maybe the third Spiderman film will involve the two villains.

\- The twist of Mysterio revealing his true identity was quite predictable as everyone knew he was a villain in the comics.

\- The first post-credit scene was amazing. This reveal changes everything about Peter's life.

Overall this movie deserves a 7.6/10. I was quite pleased with it as it was significantly better than Homecoming.",c7xhmz

etq0fq1,"Just watched it yesterday. There are still some small miss steps here and there but the film is really fun and I had a good time with it. It's entertaining and has enough of action, humor, romance and plot mix together. And of course an opening with 2 after credits for the next installment. 

Some of my complains are: the villain is kinda predictable and one-dimension, but that's the same for almost all villains in hero movies these days. I didn't catch MJ = Marry Jane when they first introduced her so for a good minute I thought finally someone has ball to create a new female character. And can we have a superhero movie, especially featuring teenagers, that doesn't involve romance? Girl and boy can be close friends without loving (romantically) each other you know. Also it's so stressful to watch a whole minute of a plane destroying a lovely flowers field. Like COME ON!!! Pay for that poor farmer you just take away probably hundred of dollars from his pocket!!!

Well other than that I don't think these is much to complain. The film is fun, well done, well directed with some very good action sequences and worth to watch if you are fan of superhero movies.",c7xhmz

eson38c,"This movie had a lot of problems in my eyes. Beyond the obvious pacing issues that stem from a halfway bait-and-switch with Mysterio, the writing and dialog was _super_ cringey at times. Pretty much everything involving Flash and the school teachers was so uncomfortable. All the jokes fell flat in my theatre. What was up with that one teacher and witches? Are they setting up that thing with Flash's family for a later film? Also, ""The Blip""? Really? That's the best thing you could come up with? I know no one else knows it by ""The Snap"" like the audience does, but you gotta do better than that.

Beyond that I thought the film had some decent set pieces, but ultimately felt like the entire script was written just to take the film crew to global destinations. By setting the film against this ""school trip"" all it did was deny the audience any opportunity to feel grounded or like we could find our bearings. The film was shot in some of the most beautiful destinations in the world, but they are given next to no screen time due to the jumpy nature of the narrative. If the writers just wanted Spider-Man to have a tangible way to show the audience that he needed a break, there are better ways to do it in my opinion than a disjointed country hop masquerading under the guise of some arbitrary field trip.

Fortunately, there are some things that the film did well, like that first fight against Mysterio. The distorted reality thing was super effective, and I loved the imagery of it all. It really felt like it was ripped straight out of the comics. Even though I thought the drones/projectors concept was super absurd, I didn't mind the execution of it and it was a decent tie in to previous films in the series - all the way back to Iron Man 1.

Jake G was good not great as Mysterio. A little too comic-booky over the top for my liking, but not bad. Just felt like a pretty dramatic contrast to the grounded, realistic villain we got in The Vulture from Homecoming. I didn't understand the video that got leaked at the end of the movie. When did Mysterio have the time to put that together before he died? Even if the image of Spider-Man was a projection, he used the audio of him calling off the drone strike, which happened literally seconds before he died. Must have iMovie installed on that little wrist tablet of his. Otherwise the bald guy did it?

Again, all of that only reinforces this weird tone the film carried. It felt like a comic book movie, but not like a Marvel movie. But then you have these really powerful scenes with Peter and Happy that really resonate, but then the villain is super cartoony and over the top. Overall I'd give it a 6/10. Definitely worth seeing, but just felt super out of place within the scope of the rest of the present composition of the MCU.

All that being said, I’ve officially accepted this isn’t the classic SM that I knew and loved in the comics, shows, games, and movies. These movies are very entertaining, don’t get me wrong, and this one did go deeper/darker and play with more themes of angst and responsibilities, but damn do these movies in general just lack the gravitas and weight I need in a SM movie to feel complete. I know he’s still Spider-Boy so the stories might grow into deeper themes, and have villains that challenge Peter more, and character deaths that really make Impacts, but for now mostly things are played for laughs or brushed off very quickly. Until they go deeper and more epic with the stories and world of SM in this new iteration, SM 2 and Into the Spiderverse will always be my favorites. Shit Spiderverse was still about younger characters and was more of a comedy and even still had deeper themes and darker moments, and even character deaths, all things that define the best SM storylines of all time. So yeah, I like these movies because they’re still solid, and I’m a huge webhead, but I don’t love them just yet.

But no because we need Mid-Credit stingers let's chop up this movie and force something together. I like the mid credits and post credits stuff but not when you remove actual plot points or stuff that makes a movie. I dont use the excuse of these being a ""Marvel movie"" as an excuse to do sloppy filmmaking like these. It's like the equivalent of removing Thanos sitting at his farm at the end of Infinity War and moving it to an after credits. It's so bad and I know Marvel knows how to do these right the Shawarma scene is a perfect example of that. Also Fury and Maria revealed to be a Skrull is another perfect example it's so relevant to the plot especially to those who thought SLJ was legit acting kind bad, no one should have to stay till the end credits to get such a relevant plot point nor should it be okay for it just because it's a Marvel movie! They couldve had the Skrull reveal in the movie which thematically fits with the theme of paranoia that was present and then still had the reveal of where Fury was in a post credits scenes.

esr5u7h,"""Spider-man: Far From Home"" is a delightfully flawed film that has little substance in its plot and relies on fan-service, awkward character moments, and eye-popping scenes to keep the audience entertained. The film follows Peter Parker/Spiderman (*Tom Holland*) as he attempts to both confess his feelings to MJ (*Zendaya*) and save the world from the threat of the Elementals along with Nick Fury and the heroic Mysterio. Neither plot provides enough sustenance to satisfy the viewer, and this is due to the characters. There are no characters in this film asides from Peter Parker. Everyone else is static. The MJ plot line fell flat because MJ was not a developed character in either of Sony/MCU films. MJ was a glorified cameo in Homecoming and this film portrays her as a cardboard cutout with little to no character or character development. All characters are like MJ in the movie. Not one feels alive and apart of the world on screen, and that made the film a bit jarring.

The acting in this film is average as there is nothing for anybody to do asides from Tom. At fault for this are the director and the screenwriter. Far From Home's script needed a couple of rewrites before shooting began. It lacked an overall theme and relied too heavily on ""appearances"" by Robert Downey Jr. For goodness sake, the film has a 5 minute exposition dump. The entire ordeal was tiring. Also, how many more Spider-Man films must be made before Sony retires the mentor-villain trope? Even though he excelled in Homecoming as a director, John Watts was not the right person for this film.  Watts did not properly define what Far From Home should be in pre-production and it shows. At times, the two main plots did not felt cohesive but instead gave the illusion of two separate films featuring Spider-man. The editing and the costumes were alright but nothing really popped from the latter. 

Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home portrays an unrevised script with static characters that does little to make the audience care for the plots. The directing felt a bit jilted as there is little cohesion, thematically, between the two main stories. One word that can describe this film is ""rushed"", and that description cannot be hidden behind the numerous references to prior movies, the very few outstanding scenes, and the quirky love story arc. There is no need to see this film in theatres unless you're bored.


**Notes** ^^Spoilers ^^^ahoy!

* There was a better film somewhere in this movie about friendship and acceptance in the post-blip world
* Why doesn't the blip have more of an impact on this film? People have been gone for years. Where are the tearful reunions between friends, the need to cling on to loved ones, and the therapy sessions?
* MJ is not a character! I do not understand why Peter and Brad fancy her 
* How is Brad not freaking himself out!? The first kid shown during the blip world responded to Scott Lang in a depressed state. Why is Brad doing okay? Why isn't there a difference in mentality between him and the other kids on Peter's trip?
* That Mysterio scene was good and felt like something straight out of the comics or the ""Animated Series"" (The **REAL** animated series) 
* Could someone explain to me how Mysterio died at the end?
* Was there a Flash arc in this film? I felt that there was supposed to be one
* Sword!
* JK Simmons is back as J. Jonah Jameson

The In Memoriam bit made my eyes moist. There were couple of people who literally cried in my auditorium.

Mysterio is such a good character and the writers really had fun with him and definitely Jake Gyllenhaal but i won't lie, there was a little room from improvement this side. Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man, probably the best and that's coming from someone who loved Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. The stakes were high and then they were not? this is where it gets tricky and thus resulted in some bizzare things happening, because it's all part of something Mysterio does. Then leads into a ""CGI army"" battle at the end which i did not care that much but the ending was good.

Zendaya was great in this one but it's Angourie Rice who the stole the scenes whenever she was on the screen.

>!but back to the first film, a major theme is being spiderman and concealing your identity. to sacrifice yourself to protect the public. your friends, aspirations, and the dance with liz. but in this film, peter completely forgets what he learns as the cast makes a joke every fucking two seconds. the first half was so bad. spiderman turned into a comedy and all the serious business turned into sad jokes. it feels so messy in execution and as a result it's all over the place. getting back to protecting your identity, he literally goes in public clothes to save the day. literally confirms it to mj. carries mj on a date which makes everything obvious that mj is in romantic relationship with spidemran. connect dots and it's so easy to find out it's peter parker. spiderman also caring around his friends more during that ice monster fight than his usual decision to save the public. spiderman is iconic for sacrificing himself selflessly for the greater good. but literally here spiderman didnt give a shit about anything but himself and getting with mj!<

>!but the twists though pulled outta their asses at times with no proper build up, had great vision. i was fucking like what? why does mysterio have power and is being helpful? i believed in giving myterio the glasses too. and then boom the twist. the movie was so bad that i dropped all my theories that they were gonna do anything good with this and that everything was a joke. i disregarded my previous knowledge because the story telling was so bad, i just accepted this nonsense. it was a such a stupid way of tricking knowledgable fans and it was so poor but it got me. its stupidity made me stupid.!<

>!it was a fucking entetaining mess that sucked and was awesome. 7/10. code geass r2 but this time, actually fuck every sense of logic. the nuke didnt just only not killed glasses who should had died. IT DIDNT KILL ANYBODY. should you watch it? yes. is it entertaining? yes. does it have a good story? definitely FUCKING ABSOLUTELY NOT. it ruined the first movie's progression. the ps4 game has a much better story. it's sarcastic comedy half the time and some characters have been simplified to gags. but i liked it. but please dont ever make something like this again.!<

>!i dont know what went wrong but pls bring bck 1st movie staff!<",c7xhmz
eu79d8z,"4/10 Awful Spider-Man movie. I hope Sony takes the character back for their Marvel universe and cast someone new for the role. Tom Holland is the worst Peter Parker, so whiny, always complaining about every little thing, and that Brooklyn accent is unbearable. Drone plot was balls to the walls ridiculous, 10 solid minutes of mysterio and his crew speaking nothing but exposition, MJ is beyond annoying with her Wednesday Addams personality, EDITH? (c'mon now). The post-credit scenes have convinced me not to invest any more money into MCU spider-man. Some of the only redeeming parts of the film were the two teachers (fucking hilarious) and the reveal of Fury being in space somewhere got me hyped for more Captain Marvel and other MCU characters. I'm done with prepubescent Spidey though; the worst portrayal of my favorite superhero. I loved Tom Hardy as Venom and am hoping against hope that an older actor is cast as Peter Parker when the character swings into the Sonyverse. I've nothing against young Spider, Andrew Garfield was great under the mask, I just don't like the way MCU portrays him.",c7xhmz

esy0rwo,"This movie is by far the absolute worse MCU movie i have seen to date . I wanted to leave the theater half way into the movie .
So where do i start ? Once again our friendly neighborhood spiderman cant think straight for half the movie because he cant keep it in his pants for a girl ...i was ok with that in the first one because we were introduced to the character of this teenage boy and shown his growth into a hero but in this movie it s on a whole new lvl .

So we have Peter Parker who ignores the calls of a man who never calls anyone  just for small talk .A man whose job is to keep the world safe  but Peter is beyond that shit so he just dodges the calls because he s on vacation .
Now when finally nick fury explains to Peter what s going on and that earth is in danger and he needs his help what does our super hero say ? ""Sorry homie but i m on vacation and besides i need to bang that chick. Anyway good luck with your earth threatening elementals but thats none of my business "". 

And it doesn't stop there . When nick fury gives him gives him Edith what does Peter do ? ""Mhhh i m too immature to handle this doomsday device i better give it to that guy i met 2 days ago "".

AT that point i was thinking of walking out of the theater. I mean you show a character grow through  many movies . Getting more mature and responsible , learning the burden of being an hero , sacrifice and loss , and suddenly he turns into a retarded insufferable twat ?  Civil war was at its core about the problem of someone holding too much power and control and watching the watcher . Stark and the Cap drifted away from each other because of different views on the subject  . Peter was THERE .He has the maturity to know  realize that he s too immature for all of Stark s power but he s retarded enough to just hand it to someone he has known for 2 days ? 

His mentor gave his life for him and everyone else but he s too focused on banging MJ to be bothered to help defeat a threat that could KILL MJ ? 

This is the last time i pay for a marvel movie and that i trust the critics . I mean every critic out there rates this movie like it s the new Citizen Kane . Did we see the same movie ?",c7xhmz

 Im not against that as here 15 is the age of consent and many teens date adults, but i always though this was an extreme taboo in USA? Even seen 18 year old men go to jail for having sex with a girl that is 17 years and 364 days old....  
 I assume it is still illegal in USA for 16 and 21 year old to have sex unless they somehow got permission to get married and are husband and wife?

Previous MCU movies keep the theme of the credits scene/cliffhanger about the NEXT movie that’s about a DIFFERENT character.

Ok what the hell is going on with MJ? I mean come on changing it up a bit fine but completely different?? A dorky completely different character in every way.

Why would Marvel completely change these characters that have been with us for many years? Oh because we got to be down with the cool millennium snowflakes?

7.5/10. 

Spider-Man Far Away From Home was decent. The comedy routine from the kids actually was somewhat hilarious but there was still clearly some issues. I didn't care for Jake's acting as the Mysterio nor did I really care for the whole bullshit that Fury/Hill even believed Mysterio was from another planet. After all the bullshit that Fury had to deal with skrull shit, he would at least call some bullshit sooner or later. 

I like the villain's concept that these villains were all apart of Tony Stark's sins and his past misdeeds onto others. It was pretty interesting and it told us how people actually were going to be revenging off of Tony's Elon Musk activities. 

Also why the hell is there mini-conflict with Jock Brad vs Mary Jane aka I like death? It feels force and it feels really stupid of the writers to even implement that childish thing when Zendaya is this progressive actress who has shown to not really care for the actress role stereotypes. Also the guy is getting girls from everywhere and he decides to go for the weirdo who likes to mention death shit to get away from others as a cover?

""Ned's getting all clingy with his spontaneous school trip girlfriend."" ""My coming out plans aren't just perfect!  Nothing else will work!""  I walked out before the credits and the scenes I knew were there partially because I knew I wouldn't miss any of the actual conclusion wrapping up them getting home and crap.  But at least I know I can probably expect that from any future Holland Spider-Man films.

What made it even worse was the high school age boys sitting next to me gasping at the stupidest shit like MJ and Peter's hands almost touching or moaning when Brad steps in.  At one point, I shot them a look like ""Seriously?""

Spider-Man fighting an imaginary villian wasnt too fun to watch on screen, minus when it got really trippy. 

Mysterio was a pretty bland hero, which is really surprising due to how amazing of an actor Jake gylenhaal is, and the villian idea of an acquaintance who iron Man wronged has already been done in the mcu and was a bit frustrating to see yet again on screen. 

The relationship between Peter and mj from the start seemed a bit rushed. But later on was shown to be well done and well crafted. MJ can seem a bit too edgy sometimes but overall I think she's a likeable character in this version of MJ.

A lot of the jokes seemed to not land and the comedy was a massive downgrade from other Spiderman movies.

Loved the after credits scene with jk Simmons, a nice odd to what started it all.

etmajay,">level 2

I'd say it was a teeny bit slow at the start. I enjoyed Gyllenhaal's performance. Defo one of the best MCU villains. My problem with him is that him being the villain was expected from the start and his motivation was a bit weak (being fired by Tony Stark). He pulled a Syndrome, but Syndrome had a scene in the beginning when he was a kid, which establishes great buildup (plus it was less expected for Syndrome to be a villain). If Mysterio had more of that he would be epic, but the way he did his things were good.",c7xhmz

esmy8lm,"Who is next?

I think Chameleon would be a natural successor to Mysterio, but it might get really confusing with the Kree and all. 

MCU likes socially complex and deep characters, so I dont see anyone like Rhino or Scorpion headlining.

Goblins are a natural choice, but they have been done to death. Venom is also great, but with the spin off, I'm not confident they want to touch that character.

MCU seems fixated on Flash Thomson, so maybe he is a future villain? Or kingpin?",c7xhmz
eststbf,"Absolutely loved that. 

We haven’t gotten Spider-Man swinging through Manhattan like that at all in the MCU until that.

I was actually getting frustrated since New York is such a major part of Spider-Man, but we saw him in an airport, DC, Europe, another planet, and never swinging around Manhattan. That last scene made up for it, it was that good.",c7xhmz

99% of marvels casting has been amazing. But that's mostly been people doing something with aspects of the character to make them their own. RDJ was an amazing iron man, but its because he made iron man into that character on screen. 

JK Simmons takes that character, both visually and behaviorally and fucking rips it out of book and slaps it on screen.

Anyway, when Tobey eventually escapes the terrorists holding him captive and gets back to his family, this is the kind of shit that happens, https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVVJy15ItE1E&ved=2ahUKEwiDm7agrJbjAhVaf30KHUhCCJoQwqsBMAB6BAgIEAU&usg=AOvVaw3UKcJK_HXIuyxdChLUMVWS.",c7xhmz

My guess is that Beck never actually got shot by his own drones, and when EDITH tells Peter ""all the illusions are down"" that's a response it was ordered to give him. Beck knew he was screwed going up against Peter, so he fakes his own death in a way that also screws over Spider-Man.

Flash has neglectful parents which has really messed with him. When gets out of high school  he decides to join the military against his parents wishes in an effort to be a better person like spider-man. he raises through the ranks and gets Jacked then gets into some special forces unit. 


His parents still care nothing about his accomplishments. Which drives him to Excell more. This next mission goes awry leaving him disabled.

It's not just because they've got bigger budgets and have found the MCU's voice, it's also because all the early villains just *sucked*. They kept getting all these great actors like Jeff Bridges and Hugo Weaving, and then their characters would boil down to ""You've got the same powers as the hero, but you're *eeeeeevil*."" And that just doesn't make for a compelling villain.

The more recent villains like Beck, Ego, and Killmonger have all have far more interesting and satisfying stories, and just been stronger characters overall. They still occasionally fall into the ""villain's powers mirror the hero's"" trap, but they've been better at avoiding it lately.

etqa2u6,"Watching the trailer I saw it like ""okay there's obviously context we're missing here"" like maybe Peter will just keep denying  and she'll forget everything like some TV trope. andgured Marvel is just messing with us.

esmkzu0,"I saw that coming when he called the MCU Earth-616, cuz that's the [main] comic universe.",c7xhmz
esziy8f,Honestly the bar scene was my least favourite part by far. It was just straight up exposition with Mysterio literally just saying the things that everyone was doing as if they didn't already know. I'm sure there was a more natural way to have introduced the team of bad guys.,c7xhmz

et5huah,"How so? They shoehorned in a motivation to tie into Tony Stark for no reason whatsoever. 

My problem with these Spider-Man movies is they can't just be Spider-Man villains, they need to be villains caused by other Marvel movies which is just annoying.

Mysterio is a villain because he's an egomaniac that wants to be painted as the hero due to his failed acting career. Instead of that, he needs to be insulted by Tony Stark just to tie into the MCU.",c7xhmz

In this one you actually got to see her interact and be shy and awkward and have her harshness as a defense mechanism. They went a layer deeper and it paid off.

She was so much better in this one it did erase the fact that Hollywood seems to like replacing gingers and redheads all the time lol",c7xhmz

esk9fts,"They did that with JJJ in the PS4 game too, although it was only a podcast and you didn't get to see motherfucking JK Simmons in the role.

What a perfect post credits scene.",c7xhmz
eskos4o,I loved how they framed his villain monologue as a toast to the team,c7xhmz
esl4o80,"I just want to add to this, and it may have been obvious, but still worth talking about: the whole movie had an ongoing theme of not trusting everything you see and hear in the world around you, and so this modern take on JJJ was not just a welcome surprise, but thematically consistent with the rest of the film proper. 

From minor characters commenting such a message in relation to online news and the like, to the entire premise of Mysterio as a villain using holographic technology, deception and lies, I thought these themes on the whole were very timely and relevant (in an age of misinformation where it seems all too easy for those in a positions of power or trust to be openly, consistently, and quite scarily, frequently lying). That's not to say the film is entirely relevant to audience or reflective of how this misinformation is spread, or how it should be dealt with in the real world (it is a superhero movie after all, and having the villain being a tangible stand in for lies and deception seems fitting enough, even standing above many of the other MCU villains). 

But, by the time JJJ appeared in the post credits scene, the audience was already primed with the repeated message of not trusting everything you see and hear, that it made his appearance in the post credits scene all the more thematically relevant. And as an Alex Jones-esque stand in, this was probably the most overt or real world exploration of this theme in the movie. 

I actually think this post credit scene is perhaps one of the best the MCU has delivered, for 1) re-introducing a highly regarded character and actor 2) having an appropriate modernisation/transformation in this appearance (misinformation in podcast/digital broadcast, rather than newspaper) and 3) was thematically relevant to the movie as a whole, and I can't think of a post-credit scene that carried on the themes of the movie, rather than just hyping audiences for future movie events (thought I would be happy to hear other examples, where I may have missed them). 

I actually think this easily could have been a character or scene that could have benefitted in being a part of the movie proper, rather than an end tag, for how well considered it was, though I am still incredibly excited to see what is next for the MCU and in particular Spider-man.",c7xhmz
esl6f55,"I think the whole angry Stark employees he's pissed off over the years teaming up was a nice idea. Tony is great but he was a bit of an asshole so the fact that he has people that hate him is no surprise. It was clever how they used Stark tech in the ways that they did. Considering Mysterio's comic book backstory includes him being a hollywood guy makes the whole team of evil treating everything like an elaborate production makes a lot of sense.


I'm not sure if I'm fully on board with J Jonalex Jones Jameson",c7xhmz
esleqo0,"Mysterio and his team were such an interesting take on superhero movies also.

I don't know... oh, and the same guy got up and left before the last end credits scene. All of that and he apparently didn't care enough to sit through more credits. 

That's all sorta beyond the point though. I'm torn on the JJJ stuff. Don't get me wrong, I love J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, but I'm really not a fan of all of this backtracking and nostalgia bating we do nowadays. Sure, I remember the Raimi films fondly (I still think they're the best Spider-man films, even if I prefer Holland to Maguire), but can we ever just let something die and remember it fondly?

I do think it’s brilliant that they brought back J.K. Simmons to play him. Many have said it before me, but he *embodies* the character and really nailed it.
I think a studio like WB/DC would be hesitant to bring an actor back that previously played a character, main character or side character. That actor and portrayal being connected to the previous franchise/universe would be a lot, and I just don’t think WB/DC would do it. It’s not quite s risk, but it’s a bold move, and likely wouldn’t even consider it. Simmons did an amazing job in the Raimi Trilogy, and it would be a dumb move to find a new actor to portray him, when J.K. Is still available and, obviously, still willing.",c7xhmz

Just drones in general) which means that there is no accountability seems backwards to what he was arguing for post Ultron/Civil War. 

2. I had this same question while watching the movie. My only head canon that makes sense is that Tony made Edith a while ago, and would just add biometrics to people he deemed worthy. We see that you can ""transfer"" ownership. And when it scans Peter, Edith said something that made me think other people that Tony approved of could wear it. I suppose the other theory could be he made it shortly after Homecoming, as a contingency should anything happen to him. I could almost, ALMOST see it making sense as something he gives Peter so that he could mentor him while he stepped down from the Avengers, but the ""Even Dead"" portion of it makes that part harder to believe. 

3. It felt weird that there was no back up plan. Especially if you were going to just allow Edith to transfer ownership. Seems like a huge oversight on the movie producers. 

Edith was a cool toy, but after reading your post, I think it was unnecessary. There could have been other ways the plot could have gone for Mysterio to do what he needed to do. The only thing Edith added was ANOTHER time for the movie to say ""Oh look, Peter isn't confident he can be the new Iron Man"". I guess when Happy says that Stark never never hesitated or doubted choosing Peter could be why there was no backup plan, but even in the comics, Stark programmed a back up plan in the Iron Spidey suit he gives Peter. I just feel like they could have gotten the Peter's confidence arc in a way that didn't introduce Edith",c7xhmz
etb1rat,"Good criticisms. In addition to the Ultron thing, there was also the Winter Soldier deal with helicarriers poised to take out targets... pretty much EDITH 1.0. An idea that works if good guys control it, but the theme of the film was about this power falling into the wrong hands... which it did, and it happened *again* here. 

One issue I have with its existence is the fact we didn't see it in Endgame. If Tony Stark had satellites that can spit out thousands of killer drones, there's no way he wouldn't have used them in Endgame in the final battle. 

And as pointed out, if he intended to gift them to Peter if he died, that means they would have already existed in Infinity War, too. So where were these killer drones the whole time?",c7xhmz
et9xgd2,">Edith. I'm not sure Tony would even create Edith in a post-Ultron world. Maybe the blip put him back on that kind of track. I guess I can accept that he'd have it, but it just seems like a stretch.

Glad someone else voiced this. I really didn't like Edith at all, it felt like a cheap McGuffin. Used to allow for the writers to take story shortcuts (allowing Mysterio to easily locate his friends in danger and being able to put Spidey in more danger in the final act).",c7xhmz

My question though, is the Fury we see right after the lava actually Talos-Fury, or part of the illusion? He gives a speech that lays it on thick about Spiderman stepping up, and it felt like that played right into Mysterio's plan.

One thing leads to another, Aunt May gets shot and Mephisto (basically the Devil), offers to erase his identity from everyone's memory at the cost of his relationship with Mary Jane -- this retcons a whole bunch of other history due to them never being together and it was a dumpster fire of a storyline.",c7xhmz

eso10c6,"To Quote [this article](https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-15-things-you-never-knew-about-his-spider-sense/)

> Spider-Sense only works in relation to enemies and potential threats; people like Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson are neither. In turn, Spider-Man’s Spider-Sense is completely ineffectual against his close friends and family members. People whom Peter Parker’s trust won’t set off alarms; this means they can, and sometimes have, sneak up on him and surprise him.

>Typically, this only involves Mary Jane playfully taking him by surprise. However Aunt May has, in more than one instance, conked Spider-Man over the head with some piece of furniture, knocking the web-slinger for a loop. It’s also acted as a detriment for Spidey as it allowed Mary Jane to learn his identity years earlier. Since Peter’s Spider-Sense didn’t register her as a threat, he entered his home in his superhero garbs while Mary Jane watched in astonishment from her home next door.

est9rwx,"We are meant to believe at this point in time that Beck died, yes. Until proven otherwise that is the truth. 

However as trickery and illusions are kind of his thing, people are understandably suspicious. 

People say that he must be dead because Edith confirmed no illusions. Edith was also completely under Beck's control and could have been tampered with beforehand to give that answer. Or maybe there really was no hologram illusion, but Beck was still faking his death with more traditional methods. ""Mysterio"" also doesn't necessarily need Beck to be alive to continue operation, there's a whole Mysterio team. There are multiple easy ways to write around this going forward. Lots of reasons to be suspicious.

I think the biggest reason to be suspicious is that he seemed to plan his death ahead of time. Well before the confrontation on the bridge walkway, when Beck revealed the drones and his team was concerned, he basically told them to chill and that he had a plan. We see this plan come to fruition in the end credits when the video is released pinning them all on a rampant Spider-man killing him and disassociating the drones with the Elementals.

So his whole goal is like ""Why is it that everyone is latching onto these big brawny superheros as essentially 'leaders of everything' instead of the most intelligent and well-qualified people of our own world?"". He feels that people like PhD's and scientists and whatever else are completely left behind in society in favor of big dudes who can punch really hard and run really fast and whatever else. In a way I really almost felt like it could be interpreted as a meta-commentary about how much people absolutely love Marvel movies at the cost of things that maybe have more substance to them. 

So really at this point in the speech I kind of felt for him, and I think you're supposed to. Like ""Yeah, people should value intelligence and hard work over some supernatrual strengths and power"". But then of course he immediately becomes a murdering lunatic who wants to indiscriminately kill to achieve this goal so the audience can say ""oo I guess I was wrong"".

Plus Tony did blackmail him into going to Germany by threatening to tell Aunt May, so there's that: Peter has a lot of idolization and noobery going on. It's nice to see hero worship from Peter's end and to realize Tony was great but he was human and did morally questionable things to try to save people, and that hadn't stopped despite him dying heroically in EG.

Just hoping the next plots will branch away from Stark and Stark-made villains. Would be great to see antagonists that Spidey made, not Tony. Mix them together with Vulture, Scorpion and Mysterio and make the Sinister Six.",c7xhmz

I thought about that as well, but if this is truly supposed to be the capper to the infinity war saga, I'm pretty fine with it. There's some subtle teases though. Multiverse mentions from Mysterio even though they are lies, might point to the future anyway. Specifically mentioning 616 matters to me. I really do think in another 10 years we'll be dealing with the collapse of the marvel multiverse. Talos at the end, with Fury covering for him for some unknown reason maybe could be planting a seed for Secret War. They're already in power in some places, so why couldn't they be in charge elsewhere?  Just some general ideas I had watching. Maybe both of those are just bit parts for something unrelated and laying the groundwork for other stuff.


Totally 100000% agreed on JJJ. I look forward to seeing what they do there, because they could totally making him a full on villain in a really interesting way that hasn't really been done before on the big screen. Plus getting JK back for the role was nice.",c7xhmz

I think the post credits scene might have.  The skrulls have been a major threat throughout the Marvel comics, and since they have been introduced as ""the good guys"" in Captain Marvel that will be a nice diversion of expectations. Also, Talos (as Nick Fury) says ""don't speak her name"" when Peter asks about Captain Marvel, so they may have had some kind of falling out some time after the 90s.

Especially with the movie’s theme of him becoming the new Spider-Man and not Iron Man Jr. I wasn’t a fan of the announcement, and have no idea why the writers did it, but I know it’d be for a reason.

I feel like they've exhausted most of the jokes and drama they could from that premise (Aunt May found out and it wasn't even a huge deal) and counting the other Spiderman films we've had like seven films where this was the case. After watching the Raimi films and the two MCU Spiderman films (and there were two others films that also did this) I'm kind of glad his identity is being revealed, because we're finally moving into new territory. 

They made the decision to fast track Spiderman years ago, and I prefer it this way. I don't know if you meant 10 years in-universe but I don't know how long the MCU will last or Tom Holland wants to play the role.",c7xhmz

I like the Spider-Man arcs where he's been a more public figure, and even had his own company at one point, making some use of the fact that he's just as smart as Tony Stark or Hank Pym or Reed Richards and can potentially do as much good by making use of his mind as he can with webslinging.

I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but meh. Peter being 'outed' to the public like this left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean, my one big dislike from Homecoming was Aunt May finding out his secret in what amounts to a comedic stinger, and then isn't really explored much in this movie either. But this is just...ugh. One of the things I like about Spider-man has always been that he is masked, has a secret identity, and has to juggle his responsibilities as a hero along with those of his civilian life. Whenever a comic or movie or show or whatever ends up unmasking Peter to the public, I feel like some of the 'magic' of Spider-man is gone (and tbh, I feel this way about other superheroes as well, though maybe to a lesser extent).

And finally, his costume, which is very comic booky and seemed super difficult to translate, was done perfectly.

The more he went on, the more fascist it looked like he was leaning (which wouldn't be too far from his Civil War 2 iteration in the comics).

It's all a part of Peter's growth and all, sure, but it kinda gets in the way of the plot as a whole. It's less ""Spider-Man vs Mysterio"" and more ""Iron Man's protege vs Mysterio"".

This is what killed the movie for me. I otherwise found it entertaining enough, not the best from Marvel, too much like a cartoon in parts, but not bad (especially the outstanding illusion sequence.)

But I just couldn't get around the fact that SHIELD had this guy supposedly from another dimension - something they've previously not encountered or even proved existed - and they didn't even do a cursory questioning of how this guy was able to dimension hop, what his powers actually were or how they worked, etc.

And then there's that non-sensical post credits scene that seemingly exists to hand wave away the question of how SHIELD/Fury were so stupid. Because it wasn't Fury at all, haha. But that makes it even worse.

>I was interested in seeing how Peter has changed and how he misses Tony but they skip that. He should have revealed his identity himself, showing actual growth and taking on the responsibility.

This was literally the whole point of the entire movie. How Peter has changed now that Iron Man is gone and accepting that he can’t be Iron Man Jr and instead is Peter Parker/Spider-Man. That’s the core identity of the character. Him announcing himself would undo 2 movies worth of character development establishing that he wouldn’t do so. They even trick us and make us believe he’ll announce his identity in a Tony-esque ‘truth is I am Spider-Man’ announcement when the screen fades and we hear his voice asking for the truth. But then they reveal he’s only taking about the truth between May and Happy.

This movie was to end Peter’s arc as the student of Iron Man and to begin his arc as his own independent Spider-Man. I don’t know how revealing himself and indulging in the superhero stardom that Iron Man and Mysterio thrived on would be a sign of ‘actual growth’.

Flash, on the other hand, greatly respects Spiderman even though he has an antagonistic relationship with Peter, and comes from a rich family we know little about.

I could easily see Flash having difficulty reconciling his perceptions of Peter and Spiderman, and its possible something happened to his parents due to the events of the previous movies- something he blames the Avengers for, with Peter being the symbol he fixates on for revenge.

I'm reminded of two sayings: ""A lie gets halfway around the world before truth puts on its boots.” and also ""A really effective lie comes wrapped around a kernel of truth.""

By sending out their fake story first, and loudly, Team Mysterio put Peter at a disadvantage in setting the record straight. Especially since Team Mysterio's message was mostly false (""Spider-Man arranged the Air Elemental attack"") but also partly true (""Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker."")

So now what does Peter do? Say the entire story is fake, and let ""Spider-Man"" take the fall for the Air Elemental attack? Or somehow state someone else (e.g. Flash Thompson) is Spider-Man, which then sets him up to be exposed later as being a liar about that? 

OR, does Peter own up to his being Spider-Man, but setting the record straight about the Air Elemental attack? Even though now his life will be never be the same if the whole world knows who he is. 

Other people ITT are saying ""In the MCU they don't have secret identities so it's no big woop"" but I would say, for Peter it is a big woop. He's still a kid FFS, he was just beginning to solidify his own identity. 

And besides, Tony Stark was able to tell the world he's Iron Man because he's rich AF and has 24/7 security via JARVIS / FRIDAY / being able to armor up in seconds. Thor has no secret identity because, duh, he's near indestructible & from another world. Captain America has no secret identity because nearly everyone from his old life died off while he was on ice.

But for characters who DON'T have ""fuck off"" money and who DO have friends & family whom villains could target for reprisal, having and keeping a secret identity still makes loads of sense

EDIT TO ADD: so why did Team Mysterio send out the story anyway?  because they're villains. Because they have no compunction being shitty to Peter, even after Mysterio died.  hell, *especially* after Mysterio died, this would let them get a small, petty level of revenge",c7xhmz

Or we could say that tony put in some safeguards that would always recognize peter and give him control no matter what, as it says something like “bio mechanical structure recognized, welcome back peter” when he takes control of the glasses. Although there are quite a few weird plot holes regarding Edith, like why would tony make it that it doesn’t really ask to confirm kill orders but it does to withdraw them? Also, that he didn’t put it any sort of automatic shutdown feature when someone like peter or fury is ever selected as a target. Then again, I guess you can explain this all away by saying disgruntled employees made it this way on purpose.

If you really wanted to go crazy with the idea, you can say that Mysterio faked his death (or his fellow employees took over) and told Edith to pretend like peter was under control again, and give the news network incriminating evidence against him. This would be pretty cool, and would give Mysterio (or his coworkers) a sort of second wind. However, I feel this is far more unlikely, as i highly doubt the directors want to make another (and possibly the last Spider-Man) movie with peter dealing with an army of drones or Sins of Stark once again, but hell, who knows. Again, if we’re being real here, Mysterio and friends probably just had one last trick up their sleeves in order to immortalize his legacy and fuck over Spider-Man, the one that took the “mantle,” so to speak, from tony.",c7xhmz

• Peter wasn’t trying to be the next Iron-Man. He obviously didn’t want to, which is why he gave Edith to Beck. 
• Yeah Quentin’s motivation wasn’t as good as like thanos but it was good enough for this movie.

The answer is similar for an in-universe logical reasoning from Tony’s standpoint: he knows Peter is a good kid who has the potential to be a great leader of the next generation of heroes long after he’s gone. If you think about it, Tony doesn’t really know many of the side-tier heroes personally, and that’s on top of the fact he already doesn’t trust many people.

War Machine - old and worn out from fighting; plus Tony’s death means updating and maintaining the war machine suit would be much tougher on his own.

Black widow - well... you know...

Black Panther - He is the king of a international power house sitting on top of a stockpile of the world’s foremost technology, weapons, and energy resources. Even if he did have time to take over Tony’s place, it would likely be seen as an attempt at world domination, despite his intentions. 

Pepper Pots - The literal plot of Endgame was to find a solution to bring back all the heroes without jeopardizing his family, i.e. his wife and daughter. While it seems likely we will see his daughter take his mantle when she grows up and Pepper might occasionally show up for emergency aid in future movies, Tony’s intention was clearly to NOT involve them in superhero stuff.

Falcon and Bucky - they are Cap’s replacement.

Cap - he’s retired.

Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange - like you said, they deal with more intergalactic matters. Even if Strange is based in NY, he is more often than not dealing with mystical threats rather than everyday bad guys. His character has a bit of a god complex and he views mortal bad guys as trivial compared to what he should be dealing with.",c7xhmz

etbf7eo,">- Was a little confused as to why Peter was so awkward during the press conference at the beginning rather than his usual quippy self. Was there any reason, or was it just from losing Tony?

Remember when Peter was talking to Happy about everywhere he goes he sees Iron Man's face. When he was talking to him he talked about having to live up to being the next Iron Man which is a pretty big shoe to fill. Most of the questions at the charity was about him being the next Iron Man which obviously was a lot of pressure on 16 year old Peter Parker so close to after losing Tony Stark and wanting to enjoy what was left of his childhood. He wasn't ready to be the main hero people look on. If the audience was asking about the charity or local neighborhood questions (he asks if any of them have any local neighborhood questions instead of stuff like Avengers/Iron Man stuff) he would have done better. Everything before that speech was what made him think he was doing the right thing by giving Mysterio EDITH. His talk with Happy helped him realize he isn't going to be the next Iron Man. 



>- I seem to be in the minority that doesn't like how ham-fisted the efforts to make Peter the next Iron Man. There's an important distinction between following in Tony's footsteps and being the next Tony, and I felt the movie did too much of the latter while ignoring the fact that Peter and Tony are actually very different people aside from their tech genius. Peter is the next hero, not the next Iron Man.

Happy's talk to Peter addressed that. While he obviously has a lot in similar to the MCU version of Iron Man we still have the 3rd film to see him become his own as Spider-Man probably. 

>- I loved the stakes in this movie. I wanted something bigger than Homecoming but smaller than Avengers, and Mysterio fit the bill perfectly. I was disappointed about the lack of any ""friendly neighborhood"" stuff at the beginning (even just a quick crime bust would have been nice), which is the only thing that keeps this movie right behind Homecoming in my rankings.

Did you watch the trailers? Seems like a bunch of deleted scenes/alternate takes. I am just going to copy paste this from a previous time I listed the differences. There seemed to have been filmed a scene where Spider-Man actually did some neighborhood saving in a restaurant against mob goons.

They showed a few scenes of the [restaurant take](https://youtu.be/Nt9L1jCKGnE?t=22) down with him quipping to the police. A good one is they changed Fury's line for the trailer to prevent people from making theories that it wasn't really Fury. [When Beck says](https://youtu.be/Nt9L1jCKGnE?t=79) ""Could have used someone like you on my world"" Peter responds ""Your world?"" Fury responds ""Beck is from Earth, just not ours."" In the film he says ""Just not yours"". They also used D[r. Strange excuse](https://youtu.be/Nt9L1jCKGnE?t=95) ""Unavailable"" which Maria Hill said for why they couldn't ask him for help instead of Fury ""Do not invoke her name"" line for why Captain Marvel couldn't help. 

The [Deli/Grocer](https://youtu.be/DYYtuKyMtY8?t=26) store owner asking about planning a trip as he buys supplies in his store and getting his Passport. [They didn't show the class walking](https://youtu.be/DYYtuKyMtY8?t=50) up to the Oprea House doors as the next time we see them they are inside.[ They changed](https://youtu.be/DYYtuKyMtY8?t=80) ""put some clothes on lets go for a ride"" to ""Put your suit on lets go for a ride or something"" in the final film by Fury in the Venice hotel also with Peter asking if Ned would be alright tranquilized and Fury's response wasn't in the final film. Peter never jumped from this location in the film in the [final London fight](https://youtu.be/DYYtuKyMtY8?t=96) as he came in from the sky and was fighting drones on the bridge the entire time we see him in London. They show a little more of that restaurant sequence with thugs [bursting in with guns or cocking them](https://youtu.be/DYYtuKyMtY8?t=107). Flash's comment on why he admires Spider-Man is slightly different about how Spider-Man inspires him to be a better person before [insulting Peter](https://youtu.be/DYYtuKyMtY8?t=141) and Peter's response with the sarcastic thumbs up

[Extended scene with the Custom's officer](https://youtu.be/V38cLTYYXNw?t=5) about the banana with Peter responding ""no banana great"". Also looks like Peter got a bad Passport photo taken and montage of all the students going through customs and immigration getting stamped which also seemed to spoiled that betty and ned were dating.

[This one has more scenes of the mob in the restaurant](https://youtu.be/pTFwbF33sk8?t=14) where he webs the mob and Aunt May asks about it. Flash [line about getting so many](https://youtu.be/pTFwbF33sk8?t=106) followers never appeared in the film

>- Flash's neglect by his parents felt too random to just be for a small amount of sympathy. I'll be surprised if it's not foreshadowing anything in the next movie (cough cough Osborn?) 

They foreshadowed Flash neglect a little bit earlier in the film. When Peter was using EDITH to scan everyone's phones you can see Flash texting his mother about why none of them have been responding to him.

eteqml2,"The love triangle was there to make Peter feel threatened. As in, if his plan to confess to MJ fails to happen, he very well may lose his chance. It gave the characters some stakes, even though the audience didn't need to worry about whether Spidey would get the girl.

Honestly, it was one of the least intrusive love triangles I've ever seen. Usually, the writers will milk something like that to death.",c7xhmz
etuiy82,"But that universe designation would be the LOCAL designation.

In another Universe they might use letters to designate.  Or even words.",c7xhmz
evpisk6,"To me it made perfect sense. Mysterio is a con artist, all he does is an illusion. Let's look at his good-guy moments again: 

When it comes to his hero-role as Mysterio, now that was all fake, a total trick to make himself look like a hero, even endangering/hurting innocents in the process. Also: he was acting hilariously theatralical. Like I get it, there are such heroes in the MCU (Thor/Dr Strange etc) but that's exactly what Beck used to make people believe in his ""vengeful outer-world Power-Ranger""-role. People where so overwhelmed with heroes and villains and things that they never could've imagined to exist and the world was slowly trying to cope with the unimaginable being real (Science vs witches), it posed the perfect circumstances for someone like Mysterio to abuse and make people believe in something that's actually fake. Because who could really tell anymore after all that happened? 


Now his interpersonal relationship moments with Peter are a bit more complicated, but still make sense after the twist. Pretty much all of his alleged kindness was an act. Why? Because Beck was a sociopath who saw everyone around him as mere pawns for his main objective to become the ultimate ""hero"". He needed Peter to trust him, to look up to him, only that way he could've gained access to Starks AR-technology to make even better illusions and become even more of a ""hero"". That's why he groomed Peter, made him feel comfortable, acted like his cool step-dad. 

Now, Beck was insane and plotted his revenge ever since Stark took his technology and fired him, but he wasn't a monster and I think he might've actually started to like Peter a bit. At least to a degree where he tried to make him leave the whole super-hero business behind and be a regular kid again. See? He was seemingly nice and interested, but in the end all he did was try to get Peter out of his way. And once Peter didn't give up and start to pose a threat to his main objective, Beck lost it. He was done trying to play good cop with Peter, it was time for going bad cop and getting rid of that damn spider before his entire plan would collapse. And when that eventually happened and everything he worked for became pointless and nothing mattered anymore, he delivered one final blow to Peter, one last revenge, by framing him as a bad guy. 

He didn't ""go crazy in a matter of seconds"", he was always a vengeful bad guy, ever since he was fired. He just tricked everyone in the beginning and as soon as he started to loose control his true colours came showing more and more. 

Now Mysterio _is_ a good character. He's just plain evil. But villains can be complex too and I do think that Beck's motive/plan/worlview were highly interesting and relevant in today's time. People need something to believe in and these days they believe in everything. Who can tell the real from the fake anymore? Does authenticity still exist? Who even wants to pursue the truth anymore and who wants to be fooled? Sometimes a good lie can be a thousand times more pleasant than reality. But it's still a lie. 


Great motive, great character, great acting by Gyllenhaal. Sorry for that monster of a comment, I just came out of the movie and currently am in a fit of post-movie creativity where I want to discuss everything in great detail. But those are just my two cents on it. :D",c7xhmz

I get that this is all because they are a part of Mysterio’s bullshit (which was handled fantastically when it was revealed), but it didn’t sit well with me that it was so low-effort. The first half of the movie all felt really uninspired. Mysterio saved it in the last half (as did that INCREDIBLE post credits scene) but this is still one of my least favorite MCU films.

Even then replace ""screwed over Stark employees"" with ""Screwed over Oscorp employees"" or something. All it does is remind us that Peter exists in the MCU.

Illusions? 

Again the illusions still cause physical damage. It didn't fake wiping out a town, Mysterio wiped out a town(unless it was an illusion). 

Peter was fulled by the illusions because they are that good. They also cause physical damage so the danger is real.

Peter never fights the elementals in his Stark suits. He does so without tech beyond his webshooters.

Edith is never used to analyze the fire elemental. 

Shield intelligence as we saw were Skrulls. Who knows how much access they really have(or if Shield even has the reach anymore).

 

Maybe Mysterio is dead or maybe an illusion. This isn't the comics. It could take many years to build this stuff up. Also the Mysterio crew seemed to still be at play so ..........

My main grievance is the Mysterio reveal, not because Gyllenhaal did a bad job at selling it, but because the flashbacks just felt like bad daytime TV and he was so blatantly pasted into Civil War footage retroactively.

He's a master of deception, did he really need anything more to him than jealousy of Tony? I get they didn't want to repeat the Vulture backstory, but I liked how 'clean' and straight forward Vulture's motivations were. 

I was surprised too that Keaton didn't make an appearance at the end, totally thought the actual last post-credit scene would be him in jail watching the announcement and getting into a brawl with that guy from Homecoming and perhaps even breaking out.

Everything else I really liked though, MJ and Peter, the handling of a post-Tony Stark world, Peter not only questioning his role as Spiderman but as an Avenger.

I agree that the humor fell a little flat. Theater was pretty quiet, though it was 9am in the morning. I think a big issue was chemistry, and that they threw a lot of hte best jokes into the trailer

I think the big scenes that could've been cut down were actually some of the Mysterio ones. I figure they have to give Jakey a bunch of screen time, the reveal and the rehearsal felt really slow

I've been trying to sort through your first point, and I think you're right there too. While I never got the feeling that this was a movie about Spidey's friends and relationships, more about Peter's internal conflict, I can see how it might've been good for the character to have these conflicts take on physical form in the film. I don't mind Brad having a small role, I think he served his purpose even if MJ showed no interest. Ned's whole plot was that he was preoccupied, and even then he showed concern still for Pete. May knows he's spiderman and left him his suit, so I think she trusts that he'll be fine no matter what comes.

So I think the big point then that I would've liked to have seen was MJ having some conflict with Peter in some way. The movie hounded this ""MJ or the World"" type choice, to the point where I was half-convinced she'd die at the end of the film to really sell that he needed to step up. It's kind of unfair that Peter basically doesn't have to make a choice, he gets to be Spiderman and get the girl with no trouble.

While I imagine they'll do a whole conflict plot point in the third film, I think it would've fit more here than previously",c7xhmz

etnqx1f,"So. I do agree it was a mistake to have S-M:FFH come after Endgame. As the final film of a phase, and not only that, but the culmination of over 20 films worth of stories, it should have been the end.
THAT being said, it’s really only words, and labels. If you and I just want to think that Phase 3 finished with Endgame, and Phase 4 kicked off with S-M:FFH, there’s really nothing that makes any difference at all. It’s just where they drew the line, but it makes no difference at all, does it? It even makes more sense. If the Skrulls end up being a big part of the future movies, and if some of the seeds that were “planted” in this movie end up happening, it makes sense that this be the kickoff movie for it. So it’s just think the imaginary line that ends the phase is moved one movie to the right, and all is good cause nothing in the movies says different.

Besides that, that’s where our agreement ends. I’m not really certain that Mysterio being “revealed” to actually be evil was meant to really be a plot twist. I think they know that at least one third of their audience knows Mysterio is a famous villain for Spider-Man, and isn’t really a hero, and maybe even two fifths of the audience. For the rest of the folks it would be a shock, but for most it was expected.

And that’s why it wasn’t meant to truly be a twist. It was half way into the film, not where you would normally put a twist that you intended to drop jaws in the theater. I don’t think there was supposed to a twist, or a shocker moment, because it was expected that almost half, and maybe more, would already know. It was interesting to hear how Mysterio was actually well connected to the established universe, as a precious Stark Industry employee, and I think that was well executed.

I also disagree on Gylenhaal. I know you said you liked him the rest of the film besides his turn from good to evil, but I think his entire performance was outstanding. Honestly, IMO. His acting was some of the best, maybe the best, in the whole MCU.
At the beginning, while watching, I felt different though. When we first meet Quentin Beck, and he’s being friendly and nice, I thought the acting was bad and fake, and it seemed Gylenhaal was almost trying too hard and it didn’t seem genuine. When he finally changed, and became an asshole and revealed himself to have other plans, it all really came together. The reason why I didn’t like his acting when he was being friendly, and the reason it seemed a little fake, and a bit forced, and kind of odd in some way, was because the character was acting and pretending to be nice. During the reveal in the bar, when he starts ranting and talking shit, you hated him immediately, and that says something about his acting to me. He really does a great job as a pompous, arrogant, conniving villain is really well acted IMO.

When I first heard they were going to have Mysterio, I was worried because even for the comics, he is one of the more ridiculous characters all around. His costume, motivations, background and even his powers/illusions are really out there and clown-ish even for comics books. But I really think they did a great job changing and tweaking the character enough for him to translate well to live action. I didn’t think it would work, but he was great, and one of my favorite villains for sure.",c7xhmz

Perhaps if it was more about Spiderman lore rather than MCU movie, it would have been better. I appreciate that Marvel respects continuity, but each movie should be primarily about the titular character, and not ""Avengers: Spiderman's story"".

What, if anything, is political about the movie? Or what is even supposed to be political about a superhero movie to begin with? The only slight political note is the JJJ/Alex Jones parody in the mid-credits scene.

Yeah, well. So was Ultron. Technically, so are the infinity stones, the gauntlet, Thor's new axe, the FTL engine/energy thing from Marvel, you name it. The only thing I'm wondering about is how Tony got all these defense drones into play and into orbit around earth but how they did fuck all in the final fight against Thanos. Did he somehow build them/have them built after his death? Maybe this was explained (there was the throw-away line about how he was the ""hero even after death"").

Who cares about Brad? He was supposed to be a bit of a dumb twat and that's how his scenes came across. Job done well enough I reckon? Were we expecting more for some reason?

I agree. The Hot May shit was sort of a funny take in the first one because it played well with Tony as a womanizer. But I'm missing the wise old supportive May. Now she's just a hot milf cheerleader who seems down with everything and kinda sorta wants to bang all of peters co-workers.

Maybe you can also say that peter was using a little bit of his tingle powers to dodge the drones, but had to full on use it when mysterio started using illusions again in the bridge fight.

For your second point, I was under the impression that peter canceled the attack as soon as it opened the room, because the drones were still trying to break in with whatever that sonic blast attack was when peter grabbed the glasses back. Maybe my memory is a little fuzzy on this, but I’m sure it was something like that.

As for your third point, see first paragraph. I’ve had similar thoughts as you during the movie, but then I concluded I was overthinking it, our heroes always manage to survive some pretty insane feats. I don’t want to tell you to turn your brain off, but in the same vein, there are probably a lot of different counter arguments you can come up with if you think about it, as well as other areas of the movie that could use some explaining like many commenters before you. Especially with something like the drones, you’ll have to turn your brain off to a certain extent if you want to enjoy it fully, as with a majority of the marvel movies.

Regarding the giant space station, I’m not sure it’s 100% operational yet, and it surely didn’t exist in captain marvel. And I would do yourself a favor and not watch captain marvel, that movie was legitimately boring imo. Again, you can also ask something like “where are all the other heroes during this giant, city threatening elemental(and drone) attack in London?” It’s a Spider-Man movie, they probably aren’t going to introduce elements that will take the spotlight away from him unless they are really trying something new.

They didn't touch

>3. How can a projector blind the sun and make it seem like its pitch dark in mid day. As a far as science goes, you need a solid object to block  the sun .

Drones are solid objects. There were thousands of them

>4. The projector's don't have any hands, so when something actually takes hold of spiderman and throws him in some of the action scenes, what is holding him??

I don't even know what you're referring to. This never happened.  If you mean the dog pile, then a bunch of drones are just dog piling him

>6. When Fury Picks him up and takes him and  then it is revealed it was Mysterio all along, So again spiderman never senses that the Fury next to him is a Projection? And that too with his spidey sense?

The whole theme of the film was the Spider-Man doesn't trust himself or his instincts.

Yes. Dumb question

 You're definitely right about the projection stuff being unrealistic (can't block out the sun, imitate touch, etc.), but so is 90% of the tech in Marvel movies.  No one could survive the Iron Man suit for example.  No amount of metal is going to mitigate the impact on the body.  Anyone doing what Tony did in there would have broken every bone in their body.  And the same could be said about most tech like the helicarriers, bucky's arm, everything Jarvis/AI related, etc.  I'll admit the projector gimmick wasn't my favorite, but I think that came down to be it being poorly utilized (except for the Berlin scene) than because it was unrealistic.

Second thing I didn’t quite like was how Mysterio got Edith and knew that Peter had told his two friends and intended to kill them but still didn’t use Edith to summon the drone. It was literally showed a few scenes before that Edith could almost instantly terminate anyone Peter told Edith to kill. Same goes for killing Nick Fury. 

Finally, I didn’t like how Spidey was not trying to hide his identity. Like web swinging with your girl friend in front on everyone after you’ve told Nick that he can’t be spiderman because people will connect the dots with Washington tower. Any half witted person who knows MJ and knows that she is now dating Peter Parker will figure out who spider-man really is!",c7xhmz
eu8hh5y,"2. It WAS him sitting next to him. He probably flew up by standing on a drone and the drones were just emulating the suit he was wearing. They show the whole suit emulation thing later in the movie.

3. You're thinking of them as regular projectors when in reality they create holograms. Since holograms don't actually exist in real life, the rules as to what they can can do and how they work are completely up to the writers. So yes, theoretically holograms could block out the sun.

4. I had this same question and would like to watch the movie again to see if it's plausible that the drones just cloaked themselves and surrounded him to ""grab"" him. Although, I think that was just a plothole like you said with no real explanation.

6. Yeah agree with this being a plothole. Although his spidey sense was revealed to be iffy throughout the whole movie so I don't think he could really rely on it at that point. Not to mention he's so confused by everything he'd just seen, even at the end he asks Edith if what's happening is real.

7. I imagine this tech, which can create holograms and cloak a drone, can also take a recording of someone's voice as a sample and then make it say whatever it wants. I think we can even do that now with some of Google's technology so that's really one of the least far-fetched things in this whole story.

8. Yeah Spiderman's strength has always been ""convenient"". Sometimes he seems super fragile and sometimes he can take bullets for no reason. Makes no sense and best to just enjoy the action haha.

End credits sequence reveals that Maria Hill and Nick Fury from the film were actually Skrulls covering for them while they are otherwise occupied. Talos, the Skrull who was imitating Fury, calls the real Fury.

Cut to Fury on a beach in a tropical shirt. As he stands the beach fades away as it turns out to be a hologram. Fury is then revealed to be standing on a sort of space station.

-this isn't too unreasonable, tony has been in the public eye more than Natasha and the world wide reaction to cap was probably stifled by his exclusivity to the US, plus he was disgraced for a while post civil war

-i agree the 1 scene in the homeless shelter felt rushed and shoved in for the sake of the continuity.

-fair, it felt like they just straight forgot aunt may even had a character.

-i agree as well, their questions were blatantly tailored to further the plot and Peter's inner turmoil, not realistic

-i felt this too, something must have happened during production

-an argument could be made that this makes sense. Recall the scene on the bus in the alps where Peter looks away immediately after brief eye contact with MJ, this follows with the idea that Peter is unsure of and/or embarrassed by his feelings.

-lol

-I actually didn't catch this on my first watch, it's possible that the reason she isn't there when Peter comes out is because she didn't want to wait with Brad and he followed her(idk)

-yup, it didn't seem like an agenda was being pushed though...

-i thought that was awkward too, I'm going to write it off as a weird reference to the reimi films

-i didn't think this was too unreasonable, he was an arrogant prick, that was his character

-this is true, it makes even less sense when you consider when he says 'no avengers, good to go'(or wtv) at the climax of the movie

-literally a cardboard character

-i get what you mean but flash couldn't have fit the role, MJ has been shown to dislike him iirc

-but the baby goats!

-could be explained by the massive celebration in the streets, don't know why the opera wasn't canceled in anticipation tho

-super suit?

-i was confused by this too, they could have shown his cruelty in other ways, I kept expecting a betrayed of some kind, that scene felt weird after finishing the movie.

-in endgame he also complained he didn't have suits everywhere around the globe, Edith seems beefy enough to substitute.

-she was literally there only for the post credits scene lmao

-yup

-never saw split

-i anticipate Norman Osborn in the next movie(he was involved in sword(hammer) I think(?))

Nope. Stuff gets wrecked. That's part of what they're using the drones for, to add damage and physicality.

>\- In addition to the point above, the scene with Beck flying over to the roof to check on Peter is weird as well. He can't have recorded that conversation before right? And if it's not recorded, how did he fly over to the roof?

He uses his dome-head controller to act through the projection.

>\- In the end, there's this weird scene where Flash asked his butler/whatever where his mom is. Not sure what it is but definitely teaser for the sequel.

I thought it was a nod to why he's so needy for attention and a bit of a bully.

""Coded"" is a strong word. Happy just tried (and failed) to be subtle about ""not believing everything you see"".

>\- I don't actually care for the post credit scene where Fury's leading the Skrulls in the space. Don't really like Captain Marvel's Superman-esque battle scenes where she just flew around destroying huge ships. I mean, they surely have to nerf her by taking away her power or something for her second movie to work, right?

That, or they need to give her problems to solve that she can't just smash her way through. Sure, include the zipping/smashing bits for the spectacle of it, but make the ultimate problem something she can't brute force. That's how they manage her in the comics, by giving her smaller, more delicate problems. Often an arc will start with her smashing her way through things, then follow through with dealing with all the aftermath, or some smaller, but ultimately more important problem.

You missed something. The people who were not blipped aged. Those who were (i.e. most of the class) did not age. This is why, to them, the people they left were suddenly 5 years older - because the blipped are suddenly 5 years younger.

Yes, people other than Spider-man could see the illusion - if they were present. But they did lure him into an empty area, and then project the illusion inwards to them - and illusionist guy definitely seemed to be quick enough on the draw to be able to create some situation that would dissuade anyone intending on passing through.

But as the drones could project stealth fields around themselves (and Mysterio - see climax), they could also just cloak the entire fact that anything was happening. Anyone looking from outside would just see the normal terrain, hero- and drone-less.

They don't explain this, because there are enough context clues to figure it out - We see that the illusions look like from inside (a colour-distorted version of the outside world) and we see them cloaking themselves and others.",c7xhmz

Spider-Man was originally a sci-fi superhero, with all of his enemies being scientists or victims of accidents or experiments. I like how they've managed to keep that so far without rehashing Green Goblin or Doc Ock. 

As for other elements that have been missing, such as J-Jonah and the hatred of Spider-Man as a public menace. Original public view on the Avengers would have been positive as they appeared to save New York from an alien invasion. The events of Ultron and the Captain America films may have marred the world view on the team but it was still generally positive. Now, without the charismatic face of the Avengers and the more public members out of the picture, and Mysterio's attack on Spidey's reputation, the public view on superheroes may shift. Worse yet (or better for the story), in the comics Spidey pretty much took all the hate from the likes of JJJ due to his isolated approach and refusal to join the team and have to reveal his identity. However, in the MCU, he's pretty much the most public face of the remaining team and has been Tony's/ Iron Man's protege since his first big public introduction. It may be that the third Spidey film has him dealing with the negative public view and trying to redeem the public image of the Avengers name rather than just his own.",c7xhmz

Marvel eventually introduced the idea of a multiverse too. In Marvel's case they have a character called Captain Britain who is the only character to exist in every single universe. The Captain Britain from the main universe the comics take place in is universe 616. They just picked an arbitrary high number. 

When Mysterio says what universe he's from he says it's 8311. That's an easter egg because 8311 is the Spider-Ham universe. 

When the Avengers and Justice League did a crossover the Marvel universe was referred to as Earth 616 implying that DC and Marvel are part of the same multi-verse. A lot of comic readers refer to the mainline Marvel comics universe as Earth 616 because of that.",c7xhmz

esqqzfn,"I read in an article when homecoming came out that Vulture has a strict sense of honor/fair play.  Spider-Man  saved his daughter's life so his initial choice to spare Peter's life with the warning to stay away repaid that action.  Then at the end of the movie, Peter saved vulture's life. To repay that debt, vulture did not divulge Peter's name to that other inmate.  Now they are even, in Vulture's eyes. 

I don't think there was a any character growth or seeing the errors of his ways. If he gets out, and crosses paths with spidey again, all bets are off.",c7xhmz

I think you're maybe getting downvoted because of how aggressively you argue your points and because you're doubting how much of a fan someone is if they do enjoy this movie. But it's not unreasonable to wish for uncle Ben to work his way into the story, which doesn't mean showing him getting shot again. He is a very significant part of both Peter's life and why spider-man is what he is. I'm still holding out for him to be referenced more in the next one, but it's kinda looking less and less likely. And the biggest offence I think was uncle Ben's suitcase being destroyed and no one batted an eye.

Fury and Hill are driving in the SUV. They change and its revealed its Talos and his wife. She urges him to call Fury and Talos resists but finally caves in.

People keep asking me where the avengers are and I dont know how to answer that.""

They cut to Fury receiving the video call on a beach, where he hangs up midway. The beach fades away as a simulation, and then Fury steps out from his simulation module.

Question is how could Spider-Man be throwing actual rocks into the Fire elemental. Could be explained by how during the Berlin sequence that when Spider-Man thought he grabbed mysterio and pulls and it turns out he grabbed a crane instead. The illusion showed a rock. Spider-Man web grabbed it and swung it. Drones created the illusion it hit but the actual rock either never existed or it just being hidden by the illusion and it just hits the ground or something.

Tom Holland doesn't struggle in the same way older Peter Parkers do, but it is the same struggle nevertheless.  Older Peter Parkers have to balance career, college/post-grad, social and love life with being one of the strongest superheroes in Earth's arsenal. Holland doesn't have to worry about money, but school (Homecoming) and social/love (Far From Home) keep Holland's Spiderman struggle in the same way any other Peter Parker does. 

The difference, and what I think your actual with Tom Holland's Spiderman, versus Toby Maguire's, or even Andrew Garfield's, is that Holland's Spiderman doesn't suffer isolation with these problems. From the introduction of Holland's character, he has Tony Stark, Happy, and Ned helping him cope with the difficulties of living both as Spiderman and Peter Parker (especially Ned), later picking up Aunt May and MJ (and now, apparently, the world), so it takes a lot of the edge that these existential-esque crises that arise at the core of other Peter Parkers' aforementioned struggles.

Its refreshing to not have forced in conflict between Aunt May and Peter, and allows us to focus on the meat of the story. 

I think this movie tried really hard to be standalone. Tony was an important character for Peter, and we needed to see him deal with the aftermath and, in the scene with him and happy on the plane, step into Tony's shoes.

eswzb6q,The trailer actually kept that part secret by having nick fury [saying ours ](https://youtu.be/Nt9L1jCKGnE). Though watching the trailers there are quite a few deleted scenes. Spider-man talking to the cops. Him talking to the deli owner. Getting his passport done. Asking if Ned would be ok on his back.,c7xhmz

eu46u5x,I really liked that scene it was trippy and amazing. But I feel like Mysterio is the type of guy to come up with something a bit more fucked up than Iron Man coming out of the ground. I was seriously expecting a short Uncle Ben throwback or if they still wanted Tony in there they could have had him and Peter talking before Tony starts to dust away the same way Peter did at the end of Infinity War. That would have had a bigger lasting impact on Peter and the audience would have been shocked by the throwback.,c7xhmz
esvfngw,[deleted],c7xhmz
esvnpu9,That also felt like a scene from the Spider-Man PS4 game.

In the comics Mysterio uses hypnogens and hallucinogens alongside the illusions - only illusions just makes no sense - how are a bunch of drones supposed to make Peter feel like he's knee deep in sand?

It works really well, given the daily tabloids the Daily Bugle originally parodied/represented aren’t at all culturally relevant anymore.

I don't know, it's not like Mysterio actually presented proof. It's just the word of someone who will seen be revealed as a brutal murderer. When the truth comes out, a lot of people will assume everything he said was a lie. Some will still believe the one true thing he said, but if one of the Skrulls poses as Spider-Man with Peter in the room, then that should convince enough people that Mysterio was lying for the secret identity game to still be in play.

They've done much more convoluted things in the comics to reset the status of heroes whose identities have been revealed. And other times, they've gone in the other direction and just kept it simple (like in Mark Waid's Daredevil run, where Matt Murdock just denied being Daredevil even though his identity was already public knowledge; there's no reason they couldn't do something like that here, but the Skrulls seem like an obvious out either way).",c7xhmz

et148dd, I agree it was pretty clunky exposition but I feel like they had to do it and did it maybe the best way they could without having a shitty ‘villain reveals plot to the hero’ bit and instead made it them celebrating with each other and bragging about how far they’ve come and how much they had to do to get there. I also kind of appreciated the cheesiness of it as it’s what helped make this movie feel like a full on cbm.

esr0kpz,"You can tell by the state of the galaxy in GOTG 1 the Kree chilled out a lot. Ronan has gone full batshit crazy, bathing in blood, screaming a lot and allying with Thanos. In Captain Marvel hes a lot more reserved and better natured.

I think CM really messes up the Kree, probably by killing Supreme intelligence, wiping out their military, removing their forces from their 'outposts', and forcing them to sign peace treaties with Skrulls and co. By this point they probably just want things to go back to normal but Ronan is an extremist and he'd rather fight to the death so they cut him loose.


 Until he signs up with Thanos AND gets the space stone he s more annoying than anything else so he flies under her radar, leaving him to be defeated at the last minute by the Guardians.

The MCU Kree created Inhumans by stealing humans and turning them into living weapons for war. When they got too strong to control they pissed off back to space. In doing this they inadvertently caused like 90% of the conflict in the tv show. Ronan calling her a weapon is actually referencing this, and she was (accidentally) created by Kree science, so having a new Kree made human weapon totally wreck the Kree empire is delicious irony.",c7xhmz
esms2ld,I don’t think it’s over.  At the end Ronan was all about catching her because she’s a cool weapon.,c7xhmz
eskmue5,"Presumably only since Endgame, since getting Snapped and back seems like it would warrant a vacation, and Fury probably wouldn’t trust Talos with his Captain Marvel pager for 30-40 years, not to mention that his general persona was pretty different from the rest of the MCU in this film. Talos also left with Captain Marvel and the rest of the Skrulls at the end of CM iirc, and Talos probably wouldn’t be down to immediately bail on his family he just reconnected with after many years just to cover for Fury.",c7xhmz
esnpuul,"Captain Marvel is basically a god like being who saved his wife, daughter and people. So when someone casually suggests Captain Marvel for something that might be something below her pay grade or casually he might be offended.",c7xhmz
etktodg,"Ok, but first off, Talos belongs to a different culture. There might be a major politeness factor in Skrull culture that we simply don't have on C53. 


Second, Carol basically saved his entire species from the Kree's horrific race war genocide. She's also super strong and apparently immortal.

It's not too surprising Talos would have some major hero worship emotions tied up to her now, especially considering Parker is a 'young child' bringing her up semi-disrespectfully and for the sole purpose of fobbing off his hero duties.",c7xhmz
esu0es3,"The Skrulls were shown to be standing in for Fury likely per his request, as they are shown nervously reporting in to him that they followed his instructions albeit with some mishaps along the way, followed by Fury hanging up on them as he leaves a simulation of a beach vacation and goes back to work commanding a Skrull ship",c7xhmz

Complications arise from creating a fictional universe in which that fictional universe doesn't exist - and the actors playing roles within it do not exist.

It's one thing for a movie to say - a trilogy... but now we've got - for the first time in history - a franchise that heavily plays into contemporary pop culture. And pop culture contains celebrities. And celebrities play characters in movies.

So you have to kinda believe that The Big Lebowski exists in the MCU, but stars someone else. The same way Sylvester Stallone plays the Terminator in The Last Action Hero.

Tony also tells that kid in Iron Man 3 in the restaurant ""I loved you in A Christmas Story"" - but that kid worked for him and Stane at Stark Industries and is now one of Mysterio's cronies.

>
>From minor characters commenting such a message in relation to online news and the like, to the entire premise of Mysterio as a villain using holographic technology, deception and lies, I thought these themes on the whole were very timely and relevant (in an age of misinformation where it seems all too easy for those in a positions of power or trust to be openly, consistently, and quite scarily, frequently lying). That's not to say the film is entirely relevant to audience or reflective of how this misinformation is spread, or how it should be dealt with in the real world (it is a superhero movie after all, and having the villain being a tangible stand in for lies and deception seems fitting enough, even standing above many of the other MCU villains). 
>
>But, by the time JJJ appeared in the post credits scene, the audience was already primed with the repeated message of not trusting everything you see and hear, that it made his appearance in the post credits scene all the more thematically relevant. And as an Alex Jones-esque stand in, this was probably the most overt or real world exploration of this theme in the movie. 
>
>I actually think this post credit scene is perhaps one of the best the MCU has delivered, for 1) re-introducing a highly regarded character and actor 2) having an appropriate modernisation/transformation in this appearance (misinformation in podcast/digital broadcast, rather than newspaper) and 3) was thematically relevant to the movie as a whole, and I can't think of a post-credit scene that carried on the themes of the movie, rather than just hyping audiences for future movie events (thought I would be happy to hear other examples, where I may have missed them). 
>
>I actually think this easily could have been a character or scene that could have benefitted in being a part of the movie proper, rather than an end tag, for how well considered it was, though I am still incredibly excited to see what is next for the MCU and in particular Spider-man.




Thank you. I tried to say this too in my comment about it but you worded it much better


I also like the allusions to fake news, ptsd after a big awful event, drones and drone strikes, fake attacks, real attacks, not believing in heroes, survivors guilt, so many things were so well covered.

And the movie was funny and heartfelt on top of that.

It was so deep",c7xhmz
et5brqo,"I also love how this the can be applied to our heroes as well, with MJ's comment to Ned and Peter about how easily and comfortably they can lie when coming up with excuses for Peter's absence. This reliance upon dishonesty, albeit altruistic, ultimately has a shelf life for our hero, and his secret identity being revealed without his consent at the end of the film is a perfect note to one of the film's main themes. Good, bad, or somewhere inbetween, whatever is perceived as the ""truth"" holds the ultimate power.",c7xhmz

But as soon as that switch flips in the bar, I realized how perfect this character was for him. When he was hero!Mysterio all I could see was Jake Gyllenhaal playing a Marvel character. Once he became the neurotic villain he totally disappeared  into the role, it was great.",c7xhmz

I know they delve into this with batman a lot (especially in regards to the joker),how they only exist because he does but it's true with Spider-Man as well.

But I also think it would be kind of odd to have Quentin Beck have beef with Spider-Man when he's only been around for what a year or two before he got snapped?

I think it's a nice middle ground to the other side tho because they do that with Iron Man and so it carries on to Spider-Man.

Broke the pacing of the movie entirely. One minute Jake is playing a hero really well, then one bad out-of-place scene later he's a (honestly still very enjoyable) villain. That scene sort of sundered the movie in two halves.

- When he's making his new suit in the jet, some of the web customizations look like they do when you're upgrading your web shooters.

This movie actually went a step further and focused on the fact that Tony's reputation of unrivaled brilliance was in no small part propped up by his taking the credit for the work of thousands of his employees.  He might not have done it intentionally, but like most tech giant CEOs, he let people think of him as the singular visionary genius behind everything his company made.

Peter isn't supposed to be Tony 2.0 by being smarter than Tony.  He's supposed to be Tony 2.0 by being wiser, more humble, and less self-absorbed than Tony.  That's why all of Peter's villains so far have been products of Tony's arrogance.",c7xhmz

But with the advent of social media and smartphones, the first part isn't really a thing anymore. Plus, this version of the Daily Bugle seems to be the equivalent of InfoWars, so I doubt there'd be any value to joining it at all.",c7xhmz

Peter gave control of the AI to Mysterio who abused it. We've seen that Stark considers Parker smart enough to use the power of his tech responsibly, hence why Parker had the suit with Instant Kill Mode available to him and could dronestrike someone.

It's just Tony being a bit too trusting in Peter there, but then Tony was never great with people.",c7xhmz

Also the fact that he has protection and offensive capabilities without his suit. But like the whole leaving the Iron Spider suit behind in the Europe trip, these glasses can easily be written out of the next script by ""lol i left them at home""",c7xhmz

It is an intelligent AI that doesn't care about killing innocent individuals, it seems to do exactly what it is told to do no matter what it is. Killing a kid on a bus with no questions asked, killing people at mysterio's orders. So it stands to reason Mysterio could have given an order for the glasses to tell him there is no illusion. Or the whole glasses could have been an illusion in the first place. Maybe Peter never even got the back on in that scenario. It's the whole inception sort of thing, you can't really know if what you're seeing is real or not.

The snap was almost completely glossed over in this film and that really upsets me. It was probably on the level of the Darth Vader being Luke’s father reveal in cinema and we should have seen the real aftermath of it here. The MCU doesn’t take enough stuff seriously, and that makes watching them do this to my favorite superhero that much harder. If you haven’t played Spider-Man 4, watch the cutscene of Aunt May telling Peter she knew that he was Spider-Man. Makes me tear up just thinking about it. And I agree. Just like with Bruce Wayne, Peter’s secret identity is what makes him a unique superhero. He gets bullied at school, is awkward with women, and struggles with money, but can erase all that when he puts on the mask. And now it’s never going to be the same again",c7xhmz

Everyone took movies super seriously so they were able to get away with a lot of things that were endearing and SM2 was PERFECT at that. 

Now movies need to be self-aware, actively dodging criticism and themselves cynical in order to survive in this hyper critical era of film. Spiderman FFH, I thought, did enough of that to let you enjoy the movie, and then just gave you a super fun movie. It followed the infinity war ilk where it was so fast paced with so many different backgrounds that it didn't give you time to think about what was going on. The reason that works so well is that it covers up tons of ""plot holes"" or issues because the movie is constantly so engaging.

An inexperienced Spiderman, who doesn't know his own strength, would demolish anyone below him, *accidentally*.

>It wasn't about not being able to use his powers it was about honing an ability.  
  
So then why was it explicitly said ""It's not working"" as opposed to something like ""I need practice""? It's never explored *why* it's not working which would have been simple enough to do given his frustration with not being able to talk to MJ. He doesn't ""learn how to hone it"" because it just doesn't work until the end of the movie at which point it magically does again.

>This movie is Peter realizing that he doesn't have to be the next Iron Man. He is Spider-Man and that is enough.  
  
I would wildly disagree. The climax of the movie is him literally stepping into Tony's shoes (or his workshop program) while Happy beams at how similar they are for the purpose of reclaiming Iron Man's mantle (EDITH glasses) from Mysterio. If anything he realizes he can't just be a neighborhood Spider-Man like he wishes at the beginning of the film because there will always be people like Mysterio.

Mysterio also had some kind of [god complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_complex) going on, and was completly inable to accept that maybe he was wrong or his plan wasn't going to work. When some of his subordinates started having doubts about his plan and suggested he lower the destruction, he threateneed to kill them. Even when the holograms went down and Fury called bullshit he maintained that his plan was still going to work. He wasnt thinking clearly, had terrible backup plans, and never anticipated that Peter would return.

Was fine which is why I didn't criticize it. Again though, tell me one new thing about MJ from watching this movie. In Homecoming they establish she likes Peter, she is an artist, and she has a dark sense of humor. Tell me a single new thing. Brad isn't developed.

He gave EDITH away because he didn't want the responsibility, he didn't think he was good enough. And regardless of what Peter wants, the movie itself wants Peter to be the next Iron Man (symbolically). Notice how Happy puts the Iron Man theme on right after their talk, completely undercutting his message to Peter?

His arc in this movie is going from his self doubt that he can't live up to Tony's legacy to accepting that legacy and proving to everyone (including himself) that he is worthy of it.

\-That's fine, but I still found the moment cheesy,  because the moment where Peter was making the suit (manipulating the hologram, etc.) was very tony-stark-esque, communicating the message to the audience that Peter was finding his stride as a hero, picking up where Tony left off, the following close up of Happy's face was a little on the nose to me.

- Was the whole multiverse thing a lie?

- The illusion scenes had great CGI but felt too confusing to get the message across. We get it, this guy makes illusions 
- The villain reveal was probably the most underwhelming in any Spider-Man film ever
- The film felt very rushed, it didn’t feel like we had a real ‘coming of age moment’ where Spidey realises he has to step up to the plate, it’s a quick scene in the plane and that’s it. I get this isn’t as big budget as EndGame, but honestly? Compare this to the 2 Amazing Spider-Man films and you will see clear character development

Spiderman has been gutted. Sure the raimi films had their flaws, especially with the story, but at least the Spiderman character felt really genuine.

Its not a question of *supposed* to be. GotG is the best Marvel movie and doesn't make any attempt at political relevance the whole film, which is just fine with me.

I though this movie was trying to grapple with the  ""fake news, post-truth world"" political angle wayyy earlier than the mid-credits scene, with Beck's dialogue about people believing anything and at one point screaming ""I DECIDE WHAT THE TRUTH IS, I AM THE TRUTH"" or something like that. But I found that the film was only paying lip service to this theme, doing enough to invoke everyone's familiarity with the concept but without actually doing anything meaningful with it. This is an issue I have with a lot of Marvel movies but that's for another day.

Maybe I'm reading too far into it, but I just found myself wishing that there would be some teeth to the political angle if they were going to go that direction.

>Yeah, well. So was Ultron. Technically, so are the infinity stones, the gauntlet, Thor's new axe, the FTL engine/energy thing from Marvel, you name it.

There's a whole act of a film about Ultron coming to be though. And the infinity stones and Viking weapons are part of the mythology, you sign up for this when you buy the ticket. The EDITH system was just fucking ridiculous though. Tony goes from losing his shit when Peter turns off his suit's training wheels, to giving him the keys to a WMD and Orwellian surveillance system? I know 5 years have passed but not for Peter, so umm, what?

It's hamfisted, and took me right out of the movie for awhile.

>Who cares about Brad? He was supposed to be a bit of a dumb twat and that's how his scenes came across. Job done well enough I reckon? Were we expecting more for some reason?

I'll expand on this a bit, because I don't think I was clear at first. I don't care if the character is a dumb jerk, that's fine. But the ""kill Brad"" scene on the bus was annoyingly stupid, everyone in the script just acts like a halfwit for 10 minutes to make it happen. Why do they have Peter strip in the middle of some tavern to put the suit on? Just hand it to him? Why is Brad's immediate reaction to take a picture and go show MJ? That's really weird? Why does the brand new, highly sophisticated, EDITH system execute a kill order 4 seconds after booting up, without any sort of confirmation - something it needs to sign in with another profile! - or tutorial for Peter? It just doesn't make any sense.

Then the other Brad moment is when he just stops in the middle of the road in London to tell everyone what a loon Peter is and its like??? Why is this happening now? People don't behave this way? And it doesn't pay off at all as far as I remember so just take it out of the movie.",c7xhmz

On the Tingle Powers. That might be an explanation, although I would say the aerial fight with the drones would be more ""difficult"" than the finale on the bridge, but that might be just personal opinion.

You might be right on the part with the drones being taken over at the very moment they opened the room, I was under the impression that they already burned a little window into the door and then went on aiming for several seconds before being taken over by Peter.

I dont know anything about the space station so I cant really argue against that. I would just think they have some greater defense against edith than spiderman.

To be honest, I don't want to take my brain off. It doesnt have to be full on logical but they could have make him atleast take one bullet or something, or give some explanation why the drones just didnt zerk him down or have the same ""quality"" and combat efficiency like every other Stark Invention.

As for Mysterio, I’m fine with that being his backstory, just give him a bit more. Show him be even more humiliated or hurt by Tony (also this is later life Tony being an absolute asshole to someone for no reason, wtf lol).

It's a commentary about fake news, social media, and increasingly dangerous technology like deepfakes that make the very fabric of objective truth malleable. It's why they tossed in that George Orwell quote, why Flash's stupid updates were shown in a helpful light, etc.

etnnaa8,"One thing I could definitely relate to was when Peter was forced to leave the opera, and he watches that other dude go and sit next to MJ, knowing he’s gonna move in on her, but Peter had to leave.
I played a sport all through school that basically owned my Saturday’s, which meant often times Friday night I could stay out late. Often I’d be at a party, talking to a girl I liked, and have to leave, knowing she was staying, and other guys would be moving in on her, and everyone would be drinking too. Sometimes almost the exact scene, leaving a party and watching a guy walk over and start talking to her, knowing he has the whole night to flirt and work on getting with her.

I think you’re totally right about being overwhelmed, and all the other circumstances.
The movie was well done, and the biggest achievement of all IMO is successfully pulling over translating Mysterio to live action. He is one of the silliest comic book characters, all around top to bottom. Every party of him, from his costume, his motivation, his backstory and his lowers are all fantastical and honestly, ridiculous.

They tweaked it all just enough, and pulled it off perfectly. His costume in the comics is outright ridiculous, even for a comic book. But they toned down certain elements and emphasized others, and somehow made a purple and green, caped super villain who wears essentially a fish bowl on his head look great and NOT outright ridiculous

His motivation in the comics is he is a successful Hollywood special FX guy and failed actor who wants to be a super hero, so he creates fake crimes using illusions and his special effects knowledge to create fake crimes he can solve. Tweaking that to a genius engineer, and disgruntled Stark Industries employee was a great move. It connects him and the movie to Stark, who has had, and continues to have a big role over this generation of Spider-Man, while also connecting it to the MCU as a whole, while exploring how every day people in this crazy hero world might react, and the collateral damage to not only buildings and cities but people, relationships and families.

His powers needed update for translation as well. In the comics, suspension of disbelief can be enough that you can believe that Hollywood special effects can create real enough illusions to fool a super hero. In the MCU world, it was genius to make him an engineer, working with a team, at the control of drones who project holograms, something that’s actually viable currently, although admittedly not at the level in the film... yet.

Having him be off to the side, making calls and giving orders, pulling all the strings like a director, while keeping himself far from danger made a lot of sense, and IMO the perfect way to actually make Mysterio not only make sense, but he enjoyable and interesting.

Overall, very well done, and that’s not even going to the outstanding performance by Gylenhaal, who did a great job going from sympathetic, friendly ally, to petty, arrogant, maniacal villain.",c7xhmz
etpnw1m,Agreed; I had so much angst at that age that I still remember it well 35 years later. This is one of the best “teen” movies that I’ve ever seen. The constant struggle with Peter’s desire to be teenage against his responsibilities as an Avenger are perfectly portrayed.,c7xhmz

She ultimately keeps putting up with this fear though because she knows that Peter's  sense of responsibility would never allow him to just quit and his morals have always been at least a part of why she falls for him in the first place.

When you fluff up half of a superhero movie with a ""will they or won't they"" love interest sidestory with a jealous rival angle, it's bound to slow it down.

I guess it’s just the John Hughes influence on Watts’ direction for the movies. But I think Ned, Betty, Flash can be used as supporting characters for high school stereotypes, whereas MJ should be more fleshed out than that.",c7xhmz

3) It implies a hierarchy that won't do anything positive for the less powered characters. Dr. Strange is never going to say ""Oh dead, this foe is beyond my abilities.

I am a not some anti-fanboy just trying to nay say the MCU or this movie in particular. In fact I'm a huge MCU fan, and one of my favorite aspects of the MCU films is that unlike so many other comic book movies they almost always nail just the right tone of humor and just the right amount of taking themselves seriously. This movie on the other hand felt to me like it missed that mark. The jokes didn't land. The badass moments felt forced. And the CG looked really fake. The early scenes with the closeups of the IronSpider costume looked terrible. And considering how great it looked in Endgame, I don't understand how they could screw that up. Obviously this is an unpopular opinion and maybe it was partially to blame on my particular experience in my local theater (the seats we got were a little too close to the screen and the speakers). I just expected better. Endgame was my absolute favorite MCU film, and following it up with this felt like a huge step backwards.",c7xhmz
esnfa5i,"Where do I begin.

-Mysterio had Spiderman absolutely dead to rights in the first mind bend sequence. He decides to let him get hit by a train. Mysterio is 100% aware he is fighting a SUPERHERO with SUPER STRENGTH and he thinks a train crash is gonna kill him. SPIDERMAN LITERALLY FIST FOUGHT THANOS TWICE AND WAS INVOLVED IN A SPACE BATTLE FOR HALF THE UNIVERSE. -- Mysterio could've EASILY KILLED HIM by STABBING HIM or SHOOTING HIM or DROWNING HIM or A MILLION OTHER THINGS when he had Spiderman COMPLETELY SUBDUED AND BEAT. Of course Spiderman walks the train off in the very next scene rendering the whole scheme an absolute joke, removing any bottom that they had set up for Spider-Man's character (that's his low point? Seriously?) Mysterio is shown as 100% ineffectual beyond the means of a sensible plot and now creates no tension for the rest of the movie.

-Nick Fury/SHIELD is WORSE THAN USELESS as they do nothing but DIRECTLY AND KNOWINGLY ENDANGER CHILDREN AND CITIZENS. 

They are the ultimate intelligence agency. But are unable to get by Mysterios COMPLETE LIE that he IS A MAGICIAN FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION but instead WAS A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF TONY STARK. 

DID THEY EVEN ASK MYSTERIO TO PROVE HOW HE CAME FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION AND WHY HE IS THE ONLY SURVIVOR. THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION.


Believing there to be an escalating threat that could wipe out the world trusting Mysterios info on where and when the next attack will be on just his word, SHIELD DOES NOTHING BUT SEND SPIDERMAN TO HELP... but not just that... THEY DO NOT MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO EVACUATE THE AREA EITHER BEFOREHAND OR DURING THE ATTACK but instead.... DIRECTLY SEND THE REST OF PETERS CLASSMATES WITH HIM TO PRAGUE WHERE THEY KNOW THE NEXT ATTACK WILL BE FOR NO REASON. It would've been easier to make an elaborate excuse to pull Peter from his class and SEND THEM TO SAFETY. Spiderman literally almost watch his best friend and the blonde girl die on a ferris wheel along with MJ one block away, and them being in that almost fatal situation was 100% NICK FURYS FAULT.  Spiderman  shouldve tell nick fury to go fuck himself if the movie made any sense. 

""Hey spidey, great job. Wanna go grab a drink WITH OUR SUITS STILL ON AND OUR MASKS OFF!?""

I can easily reverse it and say the same thing except change each positve hyperbole with a negative one and people will still complain that I didnt back up my opinion.

In Homecoming he was used to swinging around in Queens, but got terrified when he had to scale the Washington Monument. Now he's comfortable swinging around skyscrapers while carrying MJ. He's big time now.",c7xhmz

esoyudd,He opened up and accepted the Peter Tingle.,c7xhmz
esrcb1n,Darth Vader in rogue one,c7xhmz
et84h8j,They try to keep him family friendly but put something in front of him that wont increase the rating of the movie for him to kill and he will tear it apart brutally.,c7xhmz
esnq9ef,Come on Spiderman!,c7xhmz
et160oe,No older than my son,c7xhmz
et8dpj1,Both of them also had next-level villains compared to most Marvel movies. The Secret Six is gonna fuck Peter up.,c7xhmz
etfyyh5,"This scene was conceptually amazing but I had a hard time really feeling the weight of it because of how frequently Peter had been getting bailed out by Tony and others. There just wasn't any point in Homecoming where I actually felt like Peter was in danger.

That's where I think this movie was a big improvement. Even with Fury and Happy looking after him, it felt like he was much more independent and fighting his own battles.",c7xhmz
et9emdb,"That's what having a really great actor does. He played both of those scenes with such intense focus, you really feel his desperation.",c7xhmz
ew3ur1s,"I know this a month old, but the MCU Spider-Man has been my favorite screen rendition of Peter Parker, movies and TV included, for this reason. I don't think anyone has ever nailed down that this is just a kid. Into the Spiderverse nailed it with Miles too.

As a kid, the coolest part about Spider-Man is that you could be him. He's just a kid who accidentally got bit. Not an alien, a mutant, a super rich dude, etc. It seems almost plausible as a kid that it could happen to you. Maybe super powers could be real. And then they show him Petering everything up and you're like, ""yeah that's about how it would go."" But then he finds it within himself to beat the villain and you're like ""fuck yeah, I can do that."" I don't know, I think these adaptations have gotten that down more than anything before.",c7xhmz
ew2ukc8,I think this is a reference to one of the earlier issues of Amazing Spider Man (#33). Very powerful moment.,c7xhmz
esmw5c9,That’s the moment that took me out of the movie. He gets crushed by rocks and comes out without a scratch on him.,c7xhmz
esob3zl,I was not prepared for how dark he was. I loved it.,c7xhmz
etnjtld,"Dude, at the end of the day, this was a grown-ass adult ready to murder kids with drones. He was playing zero games",c7xhmz
esv7uig,Totally agree. How often does Spider-Man get hit so hard he blacks out? Pretty intense.,c7xhmz
et6cf8r,The whole preceding scene including zombie Iron Man crawling out of his grave didn't do that for you?,c7xhmz
etq9m3x,Well he was pretty foolish handing over that supremely dangerous tech after knowing some guy for a day or less,c7xhmz

esnr5tb,"They’re definitely attempting to humanize him for his douchey behavior by showing he has a strained home life, and by golly it’s working",c7xhmz

esuo3ju,"Sad that it was spoiled in the first trailer, though.",c7xhmz
f20447i,because he's an asshole and his life at home is not perfect.,c7xhmz
et6ffxc,Unfortunately venom has made a good chunk of change. Far from home was the last movie on the sony/marvel deal. If this next venom movie does the same amount or better they'll try to dangle further spider-man usage over marvel's head and try to force them to include venom. I know marvel does what marvel wants but I definitely see sony at least attempting this.,c7xhmz
etesskk,I was thinking spider-man noir sans the coat,c7xhmz
f204aj2,He's a bully. People get glad bullied don't live a happy life.,c7xhmz
esnnfo3,"Nope. He's Harry Osborne. 

Remember this when SM3 comes out.",c7xhmz
esqbiar,I dont think this version of flash would work as venom for me,c7xhmz

esqqx2v,"Home Run ends with a battle with the Sinister Six at Yankee stadium, right?",c7xhmz
esna7nx,"Given that Peter is pretty much the only hero in the MCU with a secret identity at this point, I doubt they're going to just ""undo"" that. Plus this would be a new, different direction for the character, rather than continuing to tread the same ground yet again.",c7xhmz
esow7xs,"They could even go the ultimate Spider-Man route and just not undo it. In that run, Peter got outed/unmasked on a regular basis. By issue 100 pretty much everybody in Peter’s immediate circle knew except Flash Thompson",c7xhmz
esn72gp,I would love for people to go after one of the hundreds of other Peter Parkers.,c7xhmz
esu5zno,">Some will still believe the one true thing he said, but if one of the Skrulls poses as Spider-Man with Peter in the room, then that should convince enough people that Mysterio was lying for the secret identity game to still be in play.

Yeah, that'd probably be the best way to try to handle it (if they wanted to try to put that toothpaste back in the tube).

Though the Skrull in that scenario would probably be a stand-in for Peter, not Spider-Man. 😉",c7xhmz
esv6fw5,"Also, it's pretty easy to explain away. ""Tony Stark knew Spider-Man and had this kid intern called Peter Parker. Surely Peter Parker is actually Spider-Man?"" makes some logical sense that conspiracy theorists would come up with. Pepper could explain away and say ""No, Peter Parker was an ordinary intern, and Spider-Man is not Peter Parker"".",c7xhmz
eth6t7p,"Just have Peter go to a Christmas party wearing a sweater that says ""I'm Not Spider-Man""",c7xhmz
esr2gkh,"I can't knock the logic, but thematically, I think they can do some interesting things if Peter has to figure out what to do with his newfound celebrity/infamy. It's a continuation of Peter filling Tony's shoes; it likely forces him to take a more active role in The Avengers (and/or STARK Industries) and leverage the same resources/precautions as Tony to protect himself, May, MJ, Ned, etc.",c7xhmz
esqkt3p,I'm really suprised Beck didn't pan the camera up a bit to show Peter's face.,c7xhmz
ew65sl6,I think the fact that Peter Parker freaked out in public after the reveal kind of confirms it.,c7xhmz
esp558c,"I don’t think the world was ever aware of the parallel dimension story Beck was pushing, that was just to trick Fury-Talos. To the average person, he was just another hero who popped up to fight the elementals and then died within the week.",c7xhmz
etfv98r,"My assumption is that Beck knew not everyone would buy his version of events, he just wanted to fuck with Peter. That's why they had JJJ-as-totally-not-Alex-Jones pushing the story; most people are going to get the actual version of events and realize Spider-Man isn't a bad guy, but enough idiots are going to buy the ""conspiracy"" that his life will still be a living hell.",c7xhmz
espjnrd,The Negative Man's son clearly,c7xhmz
esnhb24,"Not to mention NYC barely even knows who Mysterio is, he was world news relevant for what, a few days at most?",c7xhmz
esnh5rm,"You know what I mean lol, Fury's existing network should still have plenty of influence in government/intelligence/media to cast plenty of doubt on JJJ's assertions, so it's not like there's suddenly going to be a manhunt for Peter.",c7xhmz
et668us,"May god have mercy on MCU if we start another fucking ""accords"" story.",c7xhmz
esk6b9k,That’s *exactly* what I mean!,c7xhmz
eskziqj,"If we get a MCU version of One More Day I might cry and not in the good, 'overwhelmed with joy' way.",c7xhmz
esndpua,"They later sort-of changed it to Doctor Strange using a spell to wipe everyone's memory of Spider-Man revealing his identity to the public.  
 
So it's possible they might go down this route, but I'm curious how this will all play out. It's pretty uncharted territory to have a teenaged Spider-Man framed for murder and have his identity outed to the world. 
 
Also JK Simmons damn well better be back in a recurring role and not just a a cameo.",c7xhmz
esk6kl0,"Hmmm. Yeah, probably not good.",c7xhmz
eso7mzq,That Kingpin beatdown was nuts. All time fav.,c7xhmz

ettknzf,"> shot-up aunt May, beatdown of Kingpin,

OH YEAH

oh no",c7xhmz
esmz79n,Doubt anything of that will be in the MCU. Gotta make it family-friendly.,c7xhmz
esmv522,We got back in black didn't we?,c7xhmz

esv7ev6,"I'm gonna fuggin' laugh so hard if they do a One More Day story arc and they wipe Zendaya as MJ and she becomes black cat hence the ""I kinda have bad luck when it comes to these things""",c7xhmz
et7nab0,"Shhhhhhh, that didn't happen!",c7xhmz
et7ykfv,"There's a what-if scenario that MJ gets shot instead of Aunt May and dies (no coma like May). Instead of being him up, Peter punches *through* Kingpin's chest, killing him.",c7xhmz
etc55be,"Wait, who beats down Kingpin, and why?",c7xhmz
ete74vh,Someone needs to make a list of who in the MCU would want to kill Spider-Man or do something to him or his family. Off the top of my head it's mainly cosmic people he's dealt with right?,c7xhmz
et9j419,If someone kills Marisa Tomei I’ll literally hunt that actor down and the writer of the script,c7xhmz
esk84hu,Mister Dormammu? I've come to bargain.,c7xhmz

etoag8v,That or Hail Hydra?,c7xhmz
esl4ftw,"I feel like Edith would’ve recorded everything on her own and Peter could release the footage of Mysterio plotting everything to convince the world. Then it would become a war over fake news. I don’t think this will actually happen at all, just that there’s no way Tony wouldn’t set his systems up to record everything and back it up a bunch. So theoretically Peter should have a whole ton of footage that would disprove the frame job.",c7xhmz
esoxjz6,"Yep, also when you think about it, Talos was the one who put Peter in this situation, he told Peter to take off his mask and show himself to Mysterio and everyone else. So it’d make sense to get him out of it.",c7xhmz
esyvgon,Since skrulls are a bit of a retcon introduced into the MCU after the events of Winter Soldier idk. In Winter Soldier Black Widow released all the files on SHIELD to the public. SHIELD in Captain Marvel had at least 1 dead skrull body for dissection and learned of shapeshifters so there probably are files on skrulls or shapeshifters. Unless Talos as posing as the director of SHIELD destroyed the evidence or Nick Fury did or they both did.,c7xhmz
esnee68,"Right, right, cause the kid in the 2 BILLION dollar suit is going to stop Mysterio! COME ON!",c7xhmz

eslhlf3,Same.  It was wild.,c7xhmz
eslm21e,"Immediately? There's that 2 seconds where everyone is processing and making sure what they think they saw really is what they think it is. That low rumble before the cheers. I'm from the UK, we don't cheer or clap but that did get a rise from people.",c7xhmz

esnf7gh,I was so disappointed that so few people were as excited as I was.,c7xhmz
esq721j,"I said it somewhere else in this thread, but that got the most sincere feeling cheers/applause I've ever seen in a movie theater. It was wonderful.",c7xhmz

eszx2pq,"I hate that, it's not like anyone care hear you cheer, quiet down and watch the movie",c7xhmz
et50ul7,Cheerings in movie theaters are more retarded than clapping after your plane landed.,c7xhmz
esxb42y,"Agreed

The movie needs the first mid credits scene to stay self contained, and then what’s weird is it kind of needs the second one to explain why Samuel L Jackson was acting so off in some scenes",c7xhmz
etk2cg2,Yeah that completely changed the movie. I'm pretty sure it means Mysterio won and Peter didn't even come close to defeating him lol. Crazy that that's just hidden at the end even though it literally 180s the movies end.,c7xhmz
et8uh8q,I love that,c7xhmz
esn6k7z,Looking like he was maybe at SWORD (the galaxy’s SHIELD),c7xhmz
esn4qqd,"It was fantastic that they played up his acting roots with him having a set crew, makes so much more sense than doing it all solo.",c7xhmz
esn83kx,I liked that a lot of his behaviour was still very director-esque as well,c7xhmz
esn9jvt,[deleted],c7xhmz
et3upcs,I was also holding out hope that Mysterio in the trailers was a red herring and he'd actually be good and there was some real villain we never suspected because we were so busy waiting for Mysterio to turn. But yeah as soon as he tried to refuse the glasses I was like okay yeah he is definitely just the normal con-man Mysterio.,c7xhmz
et4bmm7,Did you tell him what a chump he is?,c7xhmz
ete19bg,Nobody thinks they're watching a documentary lol,c7xhmz
etblc6c,"Yep, was just gonna mention this. It doesn't get any more accomplished as a super villain when you get to trick a respected hero to go berserk on other heroes. Imagine Mysterio just sitting back and silently giggling and cackling with glee as he watches Logan tear through and murder the X-Men, his very own family.",c7xhmz
esqqpau,Idk a lot of people like it but I hated that story myself. I just thought the writing was terrible and felt like bad fan fiction. It was 3 issues too long as well,c7xhmz
esobysl,A bit aggressive. And that story was solid but it wasn’t anything exceptional or character defining IMO,c7xhmz

Also, Peter asked ""is this real"". Not for vitals. With the device Mysterio hacked. Nothing definitive",c7xhmz

etk3d4a,The plan could have (and probably was) executed by the assistant that he asked to save the data to the USB.,c7xhmz

[This](https://comicbookreadingorders.com/marvel/characters/mysterio-reading-order/) list compiles some of his most notable appearances with zero spoilers. His first appearance was obviously a huge influence on FFH, although Stan Lee's dialogue has mostly not aged well. If you can look past that, you'd probably enjoy it. I would also add *Old Man Logan* to the mix -- it has one of the craziest Mysterio moments ever.

Great point! In retrospect, GOTG clearly shows Captain Marvel did something major to the Kree, probably destroying the Supreme Intelligence and the militaristic society it fostered. And yes, this drastic 'revolution' definitely contributed to Ronan's fanaticism.

> wiping out their military
 

But no: Captain Marvel wouldn't go full *Thanos* on the Kree, wiping out the military she once was a part of.

I hate saying this because I also just watched Now You See Me (yea I'm late) and that was a pile of shit that didn't make sense throughout, but it worked in Far From Home for me because the spectacle was just the wrapping for a deeper story: where is Marvel taking the Avengers after the main cast is gone? 



I thought it was brilliantly done. We start with some new catastrophic monster (yawn?) to a new random super hero in Mysterio who just amazingly looks just enough off (Jake Gyllenhaal looks like his Prince Of Persia character with superpowers and a cape??) to think this movie is gonna suck and Marvel just lost it. >!When the reveal happens, you're just along for the ride and you realise it's not about the villain or the action but who will take over after Tony? Why this teen? Who will stand with him?!< The inconsistencies don't matter as much any more because you're more invested in the overarching story, all without yet another world ending disaster. I thought it was a brilliant move. And I say that as someone with superhero movie fatigue. 



I noticed there was also a sorta shoe-in about ""people will believe what they see"" and wanting to have a strong (but fake) hero that can lead the way. Was that a jab at the current US political climate? A bit limp but hey.

Spider verse also did the whole new mentor for spider thing but made it respectful to the origins of spider. Here we have beck talking to peter about responsibility while Peter thinks about Tony Stark. Like? That would have been the perfect time to just throw out ‘my uncle said something about that once’. Have Peter talk to heck about his greatest regret being his uncles death being his fault and then link it to him saying something about and now Tony’s gone as well and that’s my fault. The illusion with Tony could have been uncle bens grave at first that then morphs into iron man. 

In canon we’ve literally seen peter and Tony meet like what, four times? Small meeting on civil war at his house then peter goes on the plane with happy and meets stark in the battle, Tony spends most of home coming wailing on peter for being a fuck up then we see them again on infinity war with no mention that they’ve seen each other since.

The villain connected to Stark was a bit much, but BARF makes sense for Mysterio. I’m hoping the next few films do have a bit less MCU-y type stuff though and feel a bit more standalone. 


This movie didn’t have anything just silly and overly connected though, like the random ass Ultron head in Homecoming.",c7xhmz
esn4f3u,The fishbowl helmet even had similar cameras that pointed at his face.,c7xhmz
esnkpup,"Totally agree, the movie was so self aware and constantly addressing plot holes and criticism before you got the chance. That was one forced scene that just had to be included to explain the loose ends and there wasn't really a better way of explaining all of it.

esywyy4,"It may be a little different but I think it suits this version of spider-man. They've already established that he has the mechanical eyes to help him focus because his heightened senses are very ""noisy"" and hard to interpret. They've just extended that to his spider-sense as well, where he always has it but needed to learn how to interpret that information. 

And that doesn't mean he still wouldn't struggle to keep from reacting to it in public like you mentioned. A strong reaction could still feel like someone clapping in his ear, even if he hasn't mastered interpreting it yet. 

It's neat to see a young Spidey who has an ongoing learning process with his powers. By the end of Far From Home he's feeling a lot more established as the Spidey we know, while in Homecoming it felt like he was still incubating.",c7xhmz

esn8e49,"Beck had drones before he had access to Edith, he knew that he was in deep shit when Spiderman revealed he was a phony, he was already planning something well before Spiderman got to him, so he might have either modified E.D.I.T.H. or used drones not connected to E.D.I.T.H. to perform this trick.

eso13e5,It seems like the most noticeable case of this was on the bus during infinity war when he realized the spaceship was above him. but yeah their lack of messaging in the movies are why this is sucha  problem,c7xhmz

he has married to betty too. 

unlike the original hobgoblin he didn’t have the serum and get all crazy healing factor and strength - but that was kind of pushed out as the super soldier serum. 

there’s too many properties in Sony’s playbox for a sinister six film to be good or make sense. 

so my money is this all builds to **Secret Wars**

that was what the Russo’s originally wanted to do before Inifinity War. 

and THAT is how you get Venom into the MCU proper sense that suit is found/given post after the dust settles when he gets back to earth.",c7xhmz

Why would you think that? He never used/talked to in either Infinity War or Endgame.",c7xhmz
esv76w6,I don't think we know for sure.  The ending where Beck appears to die could also have been an illusion.  There was no limit to the amount of times he could create a mirror of himself.  Then we see one of Beck's colleagues uploading something to a computer (which I assume is what gets revealed in the after-credits) but there could be more to that also.,c7xhmz

Trains have insane amounts of momentum. Thor, I could see getting hit and being relatively ok. Iron Man maybe, with his suit, and honestly that should still fuck him up. But Spider-man was basically wearing a cloth ski mask and didn't even break anything getting hit by a train.",c7xhmz

ethr4dd,He hacked the suit to get to access to kill mode though. Tony didn't trust him at first and didn't made it available.,c7xhmz
eucmfzb,Comic Mysterio is basically just a special-effects asshole that hates Spider-Man and wants to destroy his reputation because he's petty. He isn't supposed to have a deep philosophical motivation and I think that's what makes him so fun.,c7xhmz

eslzs39,"But Peter Parker is Spider-Man, Man.",c7xhmz
esnafk4,"Yep, and you can clearly see the influence of Spiderman 2 on several Far From Home scenes. Most prominently...

Game Mysterio:

- First encounter takes place in a crowded opera theater that gets lit on fire.

- Mysterio attacks the statue of liberty with holograph projector drones, claiming it is an alien attack.

- Mysterio forces Spiderman to run through a funhouse of horror, with sequences including a room full of mirrors and being attacked by distorted clones. 


Now compare to MCU Mysterio:

- Early encounter takes place at a festival that gets set on fire. Notably, Peter's class is coming back from an opera show.

- Mysterio uses holographic projector drones to fake attacks by transdimesional beings, one target being the Tower of London- which is as iconically British as the Statue of Liberty is American.

- Mysterio traps Spiderman in an illusion, with sequences including being surrounded by mirrors and getting dogpiled by Spiderman clones. 


Far From Home's Mysterio draws from the events in Spiderman 2 in an incredible amount of detail, but with a fresh take on the character. I loved it, even though (or perhaps because) I already knew what was going to happen and it still held up.",c7xhmz
esnetnw,Haha just trollin bro! The whole theater gasped when they showed that scene,c7xhmz

wow that's hilarious, i totally missed that",c7xhmz

et8m55k,"I guess Arrow is where most people would get first exposed to it. Every other time it's been some bullshit comic story, like with Iron Man or Batman.

I first noticed it with Civil War. I barely remember it but one panel annoyed me so much. It was someone telling Iron Man that his identity is secret and has to keep it that way. Someone else said ""Wait didn't you expose yourself to the world?""

And Tony replies ""Oh yeah that was a while ago. I went back to a secret identity when Rhody saved my ass in Issue 265""

It's the Pat thing. I hate how little narrative continuity there are in comics. And that all stems from different writers wanting to do different things, though they're all confined to some extreme basic bullet point list that the general public can agree on.",c7xhmz
esmgxrq,"Yeah, also there’s some short dialogue where Beck asks why aren’t all the drones firing and it’s because he’s in the blast zone, but he says to fire them all anyway, thus enabling the situation where he gets himself shot by his own drone.",c7xhmz
esmdemf,"I’ve loved all the actors for Spider-Man, and never thought that Maguire didn’t quip enough, so I don’t think I’m biased. I just think that in this movie there weren’t really any situations where him quipping would have felt natural, to me.",c7xhmz
esmb89m,That's the one. Only one I can even remember off the top of my head.,c7xhmz

et0i7h9,Now we need a sub similar to r/ImSorryJon but for JJ,c7xhmz
et6x33q,I felt like Dunst was kind of a flat character. She was just there to give Peter a reason to care about the climactic sequence of each film. I think I've accrued nearly 100 downvotes for saying I like MJ because she's woke. I've still got bigots blowing up my inbox,c7xhmz
et6szuz,You don't read much do you?,c7xhmz
et6qbvb,Everyone on the internet was going crazy for it. People are totally racist. They couldn't handle a black woman playing a redhead comic book character and Disney pulled back. Even the GoTG director said it was supposed to be Mary Jane. As did the Spidey director.,c7xhmz

etuiwan,"The plot will overall make sense, but you’ll be missing some emotional weight for Peter’s character arc. Some characters will show up without a proper introduction, because there’s an assumption that everyone watching already knows everyone. The movie does starts off with a couple minutes of exposition kind of recapping Endgame, so that might be confusing, but beyond that you shouldn’t be too lost.",c7xhmz
espppvs,Exactly. Strange would probably just portal over.,c7xhmz
eska5zh,but tony kinda fills that role in the movies,c7xhmz
esu7ch1,"I think it's a bit early to jump into Sinister Six.  I'd rather those characters be introduced in other stories first.  (You still need at least two or three other villains, and Toomes was left a bit more sympathetic toward spider-man at the end of Homecoming).",c7xhmz
esvx0yo,"He worked at Stark Industries, not Shield.",c7xhmz
esvrv6r,"I mean, he was a Stark employee that likely never interacted with the Shield folks, no?",c7xhmz
eta2ujh,"Well there are different kinds of smart. He might be a technological genius (he did create his spiderwebs) but on the emotional/psychological level he is still a teenager. A teenager who wants to live a normal vacation with his friends, a teenager who has seen how terrible the actual superhero job is. He's been burdened by the responsibilty of filling Iron-Man shoes and he is overwhelmed. If Peter met a guy that not only knows what loss is (For Peter, Beck's entire planet was destroyed) but also risked his life to save the world - not to mention is trusted by Nick Fury - AND ALSO means he gets to free himself from the burden that has been plaguing him for a time then yes he is going to rationalize the decision that EDITH is better off with Mysterio. 

We can fully see it is a dumb decision because we have the whole picture.  Peter doesn't and he has other motives for not wanting EDITH. So yeah it makes sense.",c7xhmz

et5ioei,"I won't worry about it. I'm guessing that scene is just like the Nick fury scene in iron Man one. Makes it seem like something really important will happen and the e in iron Man 2 ""I told you I didn't wanna be in your club""

et5ipc4,"I had my issues with the game, but I liked its story much better than far from home.",c7xhmz
et905cd,"Understood, but it's still jarring to see this really big moment glossed over. It's not that often they've shown Aunt May finding out. It's like glossing over JJJ finding out who Peter is - like you could do gloss over it but it's more interesting not to.

 Showing Aunt May adjusting to his identity would've cemented the whole ""neighborhood"" thing and made her appear as more of a character than an NPC showing up every now and then to forward parts of the plot.",c7xhmz

esnsy8y,Sure. I don't disagree some people will be like JJJ. I am just saying 99% won't believe that for long.,c7xhmz
esns5z2,"Yeah, I am not saying people will ignore the name Peter Parker. I am saying no one has any reason to believe Mysterio (who was never actually interviewed or was anything other than flavour of the week) over an Avenger who saved the universe. Only half of the midcredits video will stick.",c7xhmz
esnsgq3,"Yeah and they have Spider-man to believe in now. All it takes is a statement from any hero or Nick Fury saying the truth and you get 99% of people back on your side. Of course there will always be JJJs but they're very few.

&#x200B;

That said, I still don't think it makes sense that the world is acting like every hero has disappeared. And it's very convenient that no one else was called by ""Fury."" Bruce, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Falcon/new Cap, Bucky... the Avengers are there.",c7xhmz
esmw6pc,It doesn't make sense for the general public to believe Trump but it happens a lot anyways.,c7xhmz

esnnhmt,"I don't think it's hard, it's just a matter of balancing the screentime. For me Mysterio wasn't bad at all, but he's missing like another one scene or few character moments that would really punctuate him. He is quite clearly to me not on the same level as Thanos, Loki, Killmonger, or even Vulture as a character. As far as presence goes though he's great because Gyllenhall is a fantastic actor and the effects given for his visuals are a highlight.

The exposition drop is weird because it has to be given to us in some way, but the way they did it came off awkward. If they handled that better it could've really been what made him elevate to being a better character.",c7xhmz
esnnnif,"I thought he was more than just a one-off because his Spiderman reveal is going to reverberate through the next films. Scorpion knows his target, and Vulture doesn't have to pretend any more. Much better than for example the dark elf Malekith who really was just a disposable villain.",c7xhmz
esnk1os,"Yeah, I think it all just comes down to personal opinion. They both are truly great films and it is awesome we have so many great iterations of Spider-Man on the big screen! Makes it truly feel like a comic book universe when you have such “amazing” (pun intended) stories of one singular character brought to life! 

If I am being honest ‘Into the Spider Verse’ is probably my favorite “Spider-Man Movie” (so far) but that even goes to show how if the story is done right the character can thrive.",c7xhmz

estr21r,"It's like how attempts at recreating the Super Soldier Serum led to Wolverine, Deadpool, and others as well as Hulk in the MCU. You can argue the merits of just how much is attributed to fallout from Stark but, again, given the context of his character within this specific universe it kinda makes sense for things to still be spinning off from him.

""It's not working"" in the sense that it's not coming to him as naturally as it did. You're right, it could've been talked about a little bit more but it's not gamebreaking. And it doesn't magically come back. It's there and he uses it the while movie. Just not necessarily as strong or as accurate as he'd like especially when confronted with illusions. The climax is Spidey learning to focus on and trust in that sense.

Yes, he's using Tony's stuff but it is to be Spider-Man. The creation of his suit is him realising he doesn't have to rely on Tony's toys. He can be his own hero. Using the machine doesn't make him Iron Man anymore than that makeshift shield made him Captain America.",c7xhmz

et2ut4r,"who said it wasn't? It's been nearly 20-30 years since the events of Captain Marvel, since we don't know jack about Skrull physiology, they could have replenished their numbers. I mean at some point factions will arise, someone might have the bright idea that it may be easier to just be on Earth. And they start slowly and I do mean slowly taking over the government, maybe so they can allocate resources for their people, cover identities and what have you, and that's the start of the skrull invasion. Like something that starts off completely innocent, but power is intoxicating.",c7xhmz
evjqqcd,"Okay, either you're not being very bright or you didn't read the plot correctly. 

&#x200B;

The drones project large holograms from inside the illusion and small ones from the outside (There's thousands of them). At that point of the movie, everyone has seen that they were drones anyway after Mysterio de-cloaks all of them to frame spidey (Dunno if your reading mentions the post-credits showing Spider-man's identity is revealed to the world). 

&#x200B;

Apart from that, the whole area was evacuated after the ""Elemental"" attacked. Therefore, nobody was really around at the time, even if they were, it would look like he was fighting drones anyway (since the illusion was targeted at Spidey), which as previously mentioned were already all de-cloaked and revealed.

esu34ph,Put on a Cape and people will believe anything.,c7xhmz
esu35iw,"I see two possibilities: 

1. There is no multiverse because (as far as I know) the MCU's Earth is Earth-199999 and not 616 (which is the main comic book universe) so the multiverse thing was just made up/a nod to the different universes.
2. They might see how the fans react to the reveal of the multiverse and the ""fake-out"" and go from there.

I personally think that 1. is more likely than 2. simply because it would me to difficult to keep up with all the ""new"" universes unless they bring everyone they need to the MCU and that the question would be if it even mattered that they are from another universe.",c7xhmz
esuk4m0,Yes the multiverse is the plan for phase 4 of the MCU movies.,c7xhmz

esrqqbv,"I'll have to recall by memory most of it but the only instances where we've seen Spidey Sense clearly till now is in Civil War when he is talking to Tony and catches the vial thrown towards him, then the Airport battle where he senses something hurtling towards him thrown by the Winter soldier, then I don't remember a direct scene from Homecoming, but we see it again in Infinity War when he senses the ship in New York before seeing it and then here but then also you can see instances where his Spidey sense weren't being used. So, for my money, I just believe it's an ability he had which he never put on the forefront relying more on himself than what his Spidey senses told him and as he is getting older and more in tune with his powers, he is getting better with each of his abilities and how to apply or use them.",c7xhmz

eslumwe,"I think this movie does it a little better than the last one. Sure things tidy up for him at the end for the most part but I felt this one had a bit larger stakes and it felt like Peter had to suffer more consequences for his actions.

It's not the same level of misery he gets in the comics or most of the TV shows, but... Progress?",c7xhmz
esldx4f,In beck's speech he talks about how he designed the technology and then stark turned it into a joke. Or was that just the projector tech?,c7xhmz
esvlmyr,Another tell of this is that earth 616 is the comic universe,c7xhmz
eswnwp5,"While what you are saying is true, the comment you are replying to is a valid answer to the question. The point is that Peter at that stage believes in a multiverse, and he might therefore assume that EDITH can't tell the difference between his Earth's Beck and an alternate universe Beck. Thus it might not set off alarm bells for him.",c7xhmz
et609a3,"I get that. But as a first time viewer of FFH, it dragged and it felt like it could've been shortened to give more screen-time to other plot things. Maybe if the movie was longer, then okay, fine. But at the current length, it felt like there were other things to cover than lingering on this.",c7xhmz
et7qe6l,"EDITH is basically a decentralized Project Insight under the control of a single individual rather than a vast organization. Anyone with common sense would realize how problematic that is, but unfortunately it was Tony Stark who had the wherewithal to build it.",c7xhmz

Peter's suit and all those drones could have been recording from any vantage point, so he can find real evidence of the actual events.

evrox9s,"It wouldn't be a separate villain.  It would be Will and the rest of the crew continuing to create holograms and faked audio recordings of Quentin Beck, probably bringing someone onboard the team to be his ""voice actor"" speaking through a digital filter, to create the illusion that Beck is still alive as Mysterio.  Beck's image would be the face of the team so that none of the rest of them ever have to expose themselves, staying safely anonymous.

Not having EDITH means they'd be restricted to the handful of non-EDITH drones they were using at the start of the movie, with their more limited scope of illusions.  This would weaken Mysterio enough that ""he"" could plausibly be, say, a member of the Sinister Six.",c7xhmz

But based on context when you say authentic you mean comic accurate, which is true it isn’t, but to me that’s not a problem. All adaptations change things, so I try to judge things on their own, not how close they can replicate the source material. 

And yeah we didn’t get the duality of man stuff in this movie, but that’s been such a huge present in all past six movies so this one not focusing on it isn’t a big deal to me.",c7xhmz

Meanwhile, the Raimi Spiderman was far more compelling; he had to balance his work, relationships, and school with his heroics, and often compromised his ability to find any real peace in life.

* He isn't trying to join the Avengers, pretty sure when Happy told Fury that ""He'll call you"" (referring to Peter), he is telling Fury that Peter is doing the Spiderman thing. If anything, I think the point here is Peter needs to be his own man, not Iron Man. That's the whole idea of Tony Stark being the ""mentor"" in homecoming - to reinforce that whole ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line. I think Stark is the Uncle Ben character (can't remember if they mentioned Ben in Homecoming) - at least the way I see it. 

* I think its the love that Peter had for Tony Stark, it turned from an admiring fan (being Peter) to Peter seeing Tony as a father figure. This is why he was that broken after Tony Stark died. So he's protecting the legacy of Tony Stark rather than Peter trying to be Tony Stark.

Besides that, Tony would not have given EDITH to Cap. Cap has never relied on tech so I doubt he would’ve even accepted it (he probably would’ve suggested destroying it as it was a flagrant example of Tony overstepping his bounds). 

Same thing with Black Widow: in Endgame, she specifically says how tired she is from managing Shield and the remaining Avengers. There’s no way she would go back to being Fury’s lapdog after all that.

As soon as that was over, and Peter got back to his vacation with MJ, his relationship with her wasn't being threatened at all. 

He was basically just meant as a 1st act threat, to give Peter some personal stakes before things got intense with Mysterio. Brad wasn't much of a player after the Fire Elemental because he fulfilled his role. He was only a threat for as long as he needed to be. 

I liked that he didn't overstay his welcome, but I can certainly see why you weren't a fan of the love triangle. I'm sure if it had gotten any more screentime than it did, I would be let accepting of it.

evsec9g,"I kinda get where you're coming from. The movie made the switch/twist from Beck keeping his hero act up to openly going villain rather quick. Some people like that and some people don't. I think Marvel knew that many people who were going to see the movie would have some sort of idea who Mysterio was and what he's up to, so they boiled his backstory/reveal down to the bare necessities: Beck was screwed over by Tony in the beginning of civil war, his team went trough similar troubles, they decided to create this ultimate fake-hero to get recognition, he faked his way into everybody trusting him and now he's off to mess things up. 

Mysterio is a master of illusion and I think they already embraced that in the first half. They made him perfect. Flawless. Showed pretty much no sign of his actual intention. Filmed it like he was actually gonna be a hero. But they didn't change their minds mid-shoot and made him evil, that was always the intention, no they did it for the illusion, for the twist. As much as Mysterio fooled everybody in the movie with that, I think it was also intended to fool the viewers, especially those who didn't know him from the comics. And man, even I started to doubt him being evil for a moment, also greatly due to Jake Gyllenhaal's amazing performance. But as soon as he had acquired BETH in the bar and sat there smirking, I couldn't help but smirk too. 

I think they sacrificed a good chunk of Beck's character development (his true, evil character that is), to keep the illusion of this perfect hero going for half of the movie. We don't get to see the real Beck for half of the movie, I mean I understand why that troubles some people. But as soon as the viewer had seen Beck's true colours, while Peter and MJ almost simultaneously also find out the truth, they do their best to try and show who Quentin Beck really was: An insane perfectionistic sociopath, who needed everything to work out just as he planned and wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet into his own team's heads if something went wrong. 

Ultimately it's subjective. Their handling of Mysterio's character was more experimental than many might realize, consciously not showing us his real self for half a movie just to try and trick us. I can understand why some people aren't 100% happy with that decision, but I can also understand why others loved it. I loved it.",c7xhmz

People who aged and moved on yet when people Blipped back into existence they stayed the same.

They address the story of the blip but they don't do it in a way that's detracts from the overall story of Far From Home.

&#x200B;

That's why I don't understand this criticism of them exploring the Blip more this is a Spider-Man story not Avengers or AOS, and FFH addressed what was caused by the Blip without going into extreme detail about it because there was no need to. 

The Blip can be address in other movies, and tv shows but to expect FFH to address the Blip in it's entirety or even more than it did in my opinion it's incredibly unfair.",c7xhmz

etns337,"Right but there is absolutely a different between them.

I remember when IM3 came out and even comic book readers being shocked, and most of the time, angry/bummed.

But with Mysterio, almost all of the theories on here, and in speculation videos online, and even in mainstream media (like Entertainment Weekly, Fandango and Yahoo Movie), we’re talking how he is almost certainly still a villain and controlling the elementals. The speculation was not whether or not he was a hero or not, almost everyone agreed he was a villain posing as a hero, but what his motivations were and what exactly he was up to.

So yes, to someone with absolutely 0 idea about he movie, or the comics, or anything Spider-Man related in the past, it would be a twist. But I think the MCU folks knew that over half the people knew Mysterio was up to something, and so the “twist” was less about “oh my god he’s actually a villain” and more so “so THATS what he’s up, and holy shit! He worked for Tony and was responsible for those holograms and all these other people working with him have been in the background of the movies all along!”

Oh well, whether or not Mysterio’s reveal was meant to be a “real” and “shocking” twist, or just a revelation, no different than the villain revealing his plans in any other MCU movie, isn’t that important.

Bummer you didn’t love it, cause I did. I think you’re spot on though about them making a mistake by saying the end of phase 3 is after FFH, when Endgame was such a perfect and obvious end, but like I said, it’s easy to just “head canon” it, as people say, cause the movies give no hint to it either way.",c7xhmz

eu0hlgv,">with Beck's dialogue about people believing anything and at one point screaming ""I DECIDE WHAT THE TRUTH IS, I AM THE TRUTH"" or something like that. 

Well, influencing people through propaganda (in Mysterio's case fueled by illusions) isn't really that new of a concept. It's true that it can be seen as an attempt at political commentary in the movie because the theme rings true in today's day and age, but it's far from the first attempt in comic books/superhero movies to use that as a theme. 

I saw it more in the light of; with everything that's been happening in the recent decade - from the advent of superheroes, super soldier programs, magic space stones, rogue A.I.'s, governmental secret agencies that work together with the superheroes (and also happened to be evil i.e. Hydra), public outcry/pushback against the damage heroes cause, and even space aliens and time travel and half of the universe dying...the fabric of reality in terms of what people thought was possible is kind of unraveling. Nothing's off the table anymore in terms of what could truly happen. After such a huge traumatic event such as the snap/blip, people are probably desperate to look towards new saviors (and scared of new threats) and with there being no limit on what seems to currently fall within the 'realm of possibilities' in terms of heroes, powers, and threats. It does seem like people are willing to believe anything out of desperation and out of sheer ignorance (most people would have no real insight into how these superpowers work or how events have truly unfolded).

So to build on that theme, even if only by paying it lip service as you say, seemed to fit well within the current state of the MCU Earth and its population. I didn't necessarily take it as a dig against Trump or current real-world politics, even though it could have easily been intended to be just that.",c7xhmz

There’s a million things like this I can think of, both for the benefit to the heroes and the villains. I’m sure something like CinemaSins has a lot more to list.

Again, there’s a few things you can think about when it comes to Spider-Man dodging all the drones (aside from the tingle thing), if you really wanted to. Spider-Man is well known for his supernatural agility after all. Think about how difficult it is to smash a stationary fly (regardless of the size of the object you try to smash it with), for example, even though on paper it should be easy. Their agility and eyesight makes this incredibly difficult without a tool specifically designed to kill them. A weird analogy but you get the general idea.

That's kind of weird seeing as how seeing as how over nearly 20 years and nearly 10 movie appearances the only time Spider-Man has died was either because he was shoved into a hadron collider that exploded and fell on him or because Thanos killed him with the infinity stones.

> Tony Stark is far more beloved for saving half of humanity than Steve Rogers or Natasha Romanoff or the Vision.

Other than Steve Rogers (who didn't die in the Inifinity War/Edgame conflict) these guys are not as popular/well known to the general public of the MCU world compared to Tony. And Tony was the one who defeated Thanos.

> Everyone is doing alright post-blip despite half the population being totally scarred and the other half off-put by why everyone else is five years older now.

Yeah, but this is a cheery Spider-Man movie, not The Leftovers. Endgame was the serious movie. I'm not sure what kind of tone or heady content you were expecting.

> Apparently Aunt May is now cool with her nephew living the dangerous superhero lifestyle, despite her telling him to turn tail and run, and yelling ""what the f---"" upon discovering his alter ego in the last film.

The boy is an Avenger now, what is she going to do? Ground him? But yeah it was a change that was weird because it wasn't even plot driven. Like, I could forgive them rewriting the character if it was important for the movie, but the movie wouldn't be noticeably different if she was against it. 

> Apparently Peter Parker has a crush on MJ now, even though he barely paid any thought to her in the previous one.

I mean, it's a teenage crush. How long do you need to develop that? 

> MJ might've been looking to join the mile-high club hanging around outside the bathroom.

Yeah, Zendaya's ""I'm a dark teen who's above it all"" face looks kinda flirty.

> Venice in sinking. Climate Change cannot be denied.

I didn't read that scene as a climate change commentary or message. If you did, why do you think that's an issue?

> Quentin never really fully thought through what if Nick Fury brought in a different superhero for help instead of Peter.

Yeah I was thinking about this too. Can anyone confirm if this is a plot hole?

> One rival, Flash, wasn't enough for Peter - they had to give him an entire unnecessary second one named Brad.

Nobody would believe that MJ would go for Flash so he wouldn't work as his romantic rival.

> Quentin's crew will still go along with him after he threatens them.

Did they have a choice when he's in control of killer drones from space?

> Tony Stark had attack drones that could be implemented to kill targeted people ala The Winter Soldier. Are we still sure he wasn't evil?

He would never get away with that if Cap was still around. After all, the Winter Soldier killing system was also Stark tech, was it not? (At the very least he helped upgrade the helicarriers - and god knows what else.) The two simply had different opinions on how to protect the world. The creation of a worldwide drone defense system to protect Earth would be a triumphant moment in an Iron man movie.

> Maria Hill just enjoys being there and not really doing anything every movie.

Yeah she was there just so Fury would have someone to talk to (and people recognize her so why not).

That's basically the same from the comics.  He was never a high level threat, or an ""Avengers class"" villain.  The character is decades old, with dozens of story arcs.

Why Peter fell so hard for MJ all of a sudden, when in the first one there is no romantic chemistry at all.

About Mysterio not killing spiderman and letting the train hit him. I dont really think he had planned to kill him. Just make him back off. That's why he didnt expect him to be around in the final illusion. 

The end credit stinger basically explained why Nick Fury wasnt on top of his game so that explains all the problems regarding him you mentioned. 

Fury did mention that the city didnt want to evacuate people either so there was indeed an attempt, as to why it wasnt him extensively trying to evacuate the cities the end stinger is still a relevant explanation. 

I don't really think you can tell Nick fury to ""go fuck himself"". If he wants Spidey some place then he sure as hell is going to make sure hes there.

About your issue with SHIELD not asking Quentin to prove how he's from another dimension; how do you know they didn't? The movie can't spoon feed you all of the information, it's meant to be implied. Plus, half of the entire fucking universe was gone for 5 years due to a giant purple alien using stones that control all facets of reality and everyone who went missing was then brought back with those same stones which were plucked from the past using bloody time travel.

2. I mean that's just comic book convenience. If realism is your complaint maybe you shouldnt be watching a movie within a universe where a Norse God is a superhero with electric powers.

3. Peter is still young. Naivety is a real thing. 

4. The whole movie the question of where the avengers are is thrown around a lot. But this deep into this series of marvel movies, the fact that no other superheroes are around is just something youd have to get used too. Again the movies aren't going to be leaning on realism.

A lot of public schools have trips to other countries, but usually the students have to provide their own funding unless they can get some kind of grant.

There was an [interview](https://www.vulture.com/2015/10/freaks-and-geeks-oral-history-of-the-nerdier-half.html?wpsrc=nymag) with Vulture with most of the cast and creator of Freaks & Geeks and I loved this funny story about Martin Starr back then.

>Levine: We shot at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, and at one point, everybody gets these notices that the studio gym is now available to us if we’d like to use it. So James Franco says to his fellow freaks, “You guys, we should really start hitting that gym.” And Seth [Rogen] and Jason [Segel] could not have been less interested.

>Seth Rogen: We did not work out. No. [Laughs] We would never do that.

>Levine: Martin Starr, on the other hand, was very interested. So he started working out every day with James, and he started to put on muscle weight.

>Starr: I think I had aspirations of being a strongman. Which is ridiculous when I think back on it!

>Feig: He was getting these giant guns, big arms. We were like, “Martin, you can’t look like a bodybuilder.”

>Starr: They asked me to stop working out.

>Levine: But then of course he continued to work out.

>Starr: James and I went for, I don’t know, about a month? We didn’t go that much.

>Feig: The problem was that we had to cover up his muscles when we did the Bionic Woman scene.

>Starr: I’m supposed to just have a bra on, and so they got really self-conscious. They thought it was a misrepresentation of the character.

>Levine: So when we went to shoot “I’m With the Band,” the episode where Sam Weir doesn’t want to shower in gym class, you see these three geeks getting ready for showering, and they had Martin wear a robe! And as punishment for defying them and continuing to work out, not only was he wearing a robe, he was wearing a lady’s robe.

>Feig: We just did that because we thought it was funny that he would wear a bathrobe. We liked the idea of how these boys — who are inherently old men in their own way — comport themselves in the locker room.

Following up Endgame was always going to be a tough task but they did really well in keeping it relatively small scale and not try to outdo the previous movies.

I even liked the >!twist regarding Mysterio, that it was a bunch of disgruntled former employees of Tony Stark!< although it did depend on a lot of supposedly intelligent characters acting kind of dumb. >!Did nobody investigating the scenes monster attacks realise there were bullet holes from the drones all over the place and wonder why? Did SHIELD really not check out Mysterio's story that he came from another dimension?!< Of course, the Marvel movies always have their fair share of technology/magic ex machinas, but for whatever reason, the ones in this movie seemed to stand out more.

You're right. It's funny how America is this highly developed futuristic place with Stark Industries, superpowered beings capable of global destruction, magic users, Hydra & SHIELD shenanigans, floating fortresses, and Wakanda being an impossibly advanced nation with invisibility forcefields,  while Europe just remains...very European, even after Sokovia gets lifted up to the sky by an evil AI.",c7xhmz

ev242sg,"> The only other person I can think of off the top of my head who could see through that would be Dr. Strange - or someone wielding the Reality Stone. 

So looking at the former avenger's level threats, in the first movie the holographic projections are too localized to stop the Chitauri, and Loki himself couldn't be taken out by Mysterio, only suppressed. The drones don't have enough power to stop him.

Further, we don't exactly know the extent of Loki's sorcery, but I imagine a master of magical illusion could figure out a technological illusion fairly easily. Or he could just summon something like the Casket of Ancient Winters to AOE all the drones in the area.

In the second movie, Ultron can just use his technological manipulation to take over all the drones ez pz. Then Ultron controls the illusions.

In the third movie, you are back into the same problem where Mysterio's drones don't have enough power to take out Thanos, and they are too localized to stop his armies. That's even setting aside the infiniti stones themselves. Same goes for the fouth movie.

So yeah, Mysterio isn't going to stop any Avenger's level threats. I'm not saying he is a worthless hero, but his best case scenario moving forward would be that his lies would have been revealed the second an actual Avenger's level threat showed up.",c7xhmz

>Also, the MCU is very true to the source material but have intentionally made story decisions that were never in the comics

Yes and no. For instance, Iron Man is fairly true to the source even with changes. Fat Thor in Endgame couldn't be further away from Thor in the source material (and doesn't even make sense for MCU Thor with what they established).  

Peter wanting to be an Avenger is such a bad motivation because it's so abstract, confusing, and contradictory to his established Civil War motivation of ""great power/responsibility for the little guy"". It takes so much of the grandeur and intrigue to Peter as a character. In the comics, he wants a normal life and is dragged into trouble by his superhero counterpart, which is a responsibility (even if he enjoys doing superheroics). In Homecoming and Far From Home, living a normal life seems to be a tertiary want, which really goes against the spirit of what Peter Parker is as a character. How does one ""be an Avenger""? Aren't they just a group that gets together when a problem arises? 

Not to mention, I am SOO tired of seeing these classic Spider-man antagonists just have their weaponry and tech from Stark technology. It takes away from the technological intrigue and developments by these characters just piggy-backing from Stark. Having all of these constant references and cameos from other characters don't make the universe feel bigger, but instead makes it feel smaller.",c7xhmz

Imagine instead of fighting a bunch of drones he's fighting a hundred ""Mysterios"" or even an ""Iron Man"". These drones can project anything but they did nothing creative with them for the finale.   
  
But really that personal interaction between Tom Holland and Jake Gylenhaal is more compelling to me than more mindless robot busting.

ettljoo,"> I think the point here is Peter needs to be his own man, not Iron Man. That's the whole idea of Tony Stark being the ""mentor"" in homecoming - to reinforce that whole ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line. I think Stark is the Uncle Ben character (can't remember if they mentioned Ben in Homecoming) - at least the way I see it.

I agree with this 100% which is why it's so frustrating. I want to see that happen. It sounds like you want to see that happen too. But we've now had four movies of a Spider-Man in Iron Man's shadow, we've had very apparent imagery of Peter in Tony's program building his own suit to ACDC like Tony and fighting for Tony and countless dialogue worrying if he can live up to the legacy, etc. that it kind of astounds me that yourself and honestly many others will still try to tell me he isn't trying to be Tony Stark.  
  
>So he's protecting the legacy of Tony Stark rather than Peter trying to be Tony Stark.  
  
And we see he accomplishes the former by doing the latter. Again, we see Peter building a suit like Tony in Tony's jet, listening to Tony's music, while Tony's bodyguard tells him how much he's like Tony. He'll go into battle and improvise like Tony and take back Tony's glasses and control of Tony's satellites and STILL people say he's not being like Tony Stark. I will believe he is his own hero when the movies stop completely beating us over the head with the contrary.  
  
>Drone army sure is more grounded in MCU world compared with intergalactic reality altering artefacts.  
  
Agreed, but I don't think anyone was expecting that kind of cosmic craziness from this movie. A drone army isn't grounded compared to the older Spider-man movies which are just character on character. If it's unfair to compare to those, the drone army is just unimaginative and more flip flopping with the Tony's weapons legacy (and that's a bigger Marvel problem)",c7xhmz

That would make sense, although, I feel like it will be a while until we get another team up movie.

I thought that felt true to what I know of Spiderman, especially given this Spiderman is in that age range where you're trying to skirt those responsibilities. It felt heavier than it did in Homecoming too since we're dealing with this death that has very high stakes in the MCU

I think we'd agree that themovie felt a little rushed towards the final third. The Happy Jet scene felt like it solved the whole PTSD thing in way less time than it deserved.

I agree - that and just the whole justification of good-guy-turns-bad being mind control, even if that's how it was in the comics, is weak storytelling.

esqvga3,"Again, it’s not Disney’s call. If a Spider-Man movie wants to get made, Sony has complete control.  It was Sony who signed a deal to allow it to be a part of the MCU. This is how rights work, marvel wasn’t doing so well back in the 90s, that’s why Fox bought the rights to X-men ( which as of a few weeks ago is now back with Disney ) and Sony bid and successfully purchase the rights to Spider-Man. When iron man was made in 2008 it wasn’t yet owned by Disney, that deal happened later. When Disney purchased marvel, they were finally the company with the money needed to work out negotiations to Sony. Sony could have said no, and Disney wouldn’t have been able to do a thing about it. Spider-Man is a Sony franchise that Sony and Disney worked out together to allow the character to be apart of the mcu. I don’t care if Spider-Man and Thor are in the same comics together you need to understand intellectual propriety ownership and see that Sony has final say. If they decide to pull Spdierman from Marvel , they can, because again, they own the rights to it.

etaz7lv,"> and he doesn't have any powers of his own, just some stolen technology.

He did legit create the holo tech though, right? It's the resources he stole (EDITH), but I didn't get any indication that he was lying about being the creator of the tech - his motivation hinged on him really feeling like Stark took credit for his invention (and made a mockery of it). 

I think this is reinforced by Happy's remarks about how Tony wasn't perfect and wouldn't live up to his own standards. I think Beck really did come up with the tech, and Tony saw a different use for it and repurposed it, and it never crossed his mind that it would piss off the researcher behind it who sees it as basically stolen. 

There's some parallels to Age of Ultron there too - another problem created by Tony's hubris and overconfidence, while glossing over the negatives. It makes the movie thematically deeper, because Peter is feeling he can't live up to Stark, who he idolizes as perfect, while the villain's motivation exists explicitly because Tony was NOT perfect. In the end it's less about trying to live up to an ideal, and instead believe in yourself and try to do the right thing, instead of what standards you believe other people have. And the 'fake news' theme of the movie plays into that as well - Peter thinking Stark was some perfect ideal he could never live up to was a sort of 'misinformation' in keeping with the overall theme of the film, and it was what Mysterio exploited by pretending to be that 'perfect hero' archetype and playing off of Peter's insecurities.",c7xhmz

But on the other hand, if they are introducing the character in an universe like the MCU I don't think is realistically possible. It would need DC levels of suspension of disbelief to make the spandex suit, secret identity and isolation from the rest of the superhero world work. To have him in the MCU they need to do their own thing with the character to make it work in that frame.

Just for the get go, how realistic is that a teenager can make a suit like the one Peter does in the Raimi movies? The home-made homecoming suit is far more realistic for a teenager to be able to make than the spandex one Tobey used. How realistic is for a teen to be able to keep his identity a secret in this modern world, with people like Nick Fury or Tony Stark around? Honestly, is even more realistic to think that people that cares about him, like his aunt or his close friends would eventually discover his identity rather than having him dating a girl that is unable to realize he's spider-man.

And on the same vein, is not realistic for Tony to know Spider-man is a teenager and just leave him alone, and is not realistic for Peter to want to do his own thing aside from the Avengers after what happened in Civil War. In that sense, I think Homecoming worked great to make Peter go from wanting to be an Avenger to reject Tony's offering and choose to stay apart without it being forced.",c7xhmz

*VOILA*!

Endgame is the end of Phase 3, and Far From Home kicks off Phase 4. There’s nothing in FFH that explicitly says it’s Phase 3 or implies it’s the end of something bigger, and nothing in Endgame that makes it seems like there’s loose threads that need to be wrapped up in Far From Home, and it does everything it could possible do to make it really feel like not just the end of the movie, and not even just the end of that phase, but the end something bigger, of all the previous 22 films in all the prior phases.

Honestly I think the only reason it’s part of Phase 3 is cause it came out so close to Endgame and was developed alongside the other films that recently came out. As fans, we think of the MCU phases purely from a story telling perspective, but I really think internally at Marvel Studios it also is a way to group films together with shared development and production (not saying they’re made at the same time, but with their films being released so often and so often, I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of the behind the scenes folks and a lot of the dirty, unglamorous work that goes into these movie are shared a lot and grouping the movies into phases helps with planning and figuring out logistics/production roadmap.

The framing of winter soldier is just another plot device where Iron Man questioning Capt’s ideology of what it meant to be a Hero where it end up in a plot twist questioning Capt’s loyalty and friendship.

Second, In the Captain Marvel movie, the skrulls are actually kinda good guys in the plot twist where they ended up like war refugees and victims of the Kree and captain marvel ended up looking for a new home for them. And also in the end credit scene of Far From Home, where Talos ended up reporting to Nick Fury in space because of the shitstorm they have caused on spiderman. Thus, the skrulls could not ended up be framed for “killing aunt may” cuz they work under Nick Fury and they are too busy rebuilding their new home.

etw4hhu,"Let me just say I am speaking for myself and not whatever some YouTuber says.

First, there were no consequences shown, or are you inventing consequences AFTER the post-credit scenes? Until they show us the consequences to that reveal, there are no consequences. Look at the last post-credit scene with Aunt May, absolutely no consequence. I bet and hope this Parker won't be villified, as that makes no sense given the popularity of these MCU superheroes. As for his identity, I'm confident they'll need 10 minutes or less to deal with that, it won't be a big deal, MCU superheroes are already public personas, plus Peter is already taking his mask off whenever anyway.

Second featuring Ben Parker is not a must, but the Iron Man hero worship is weakly portrayed. Which is fine, as it is accurate, but some scenes indicate Tony is this sort of important father figure that's wholly unjustified in the scenes we saw, fans just love filling in character details from *their* knowledge of Tony and assuming he is such a mentor. Makes no rational sense.

Third, yeah this movie just retreads the themes of Homecoming, of being his own man amidst the hero he looks up to. Both films also involve Peter losing and then regaining his trust in himself, last time due to th suit and this time due to a seemingly more capable Beck.

As for the movie's other failures like the telling/not showing scene in the bar, to the plot device that is EDITH, or the weak portrayal of numerous side characters, I'm sure you can read some of those points here.

This movie is fun and enjoyable, but it is just McDonalds and Starbucks.

et8gaza,">Edith didn't bat an eye when it thought Peter was issuing a kill order on a kid in the back of his bus.

But why should it bat an eye?

It didn't *think* that Peter gave the kill command. He DID give the kill command. Jarvis and Friday would have done the same thing - Tony says ""This is our target, take him out."" and that's what they do.

Peter made a mistake by giving the kill command. Edith was just doing it's job.

But even if that was the case and you're saying Jarvis or Friday would have stopped it - then that means the tech that Tony gave to Peter was incredibly more dangerous than Jarvis or Friday. Handing over death drones with no ""second guessing"" protocols to a teenager is absolute madness!

Edith was linked directly to the drones. That's why Mysterio wanted it so badly. The fact that Edith failed to inform Peter that those drones were being used to create Beck's whole scheme would have of course totally changed the stakes in the 3rd act, but it is kind of a silly plot hole, imo.",c7xhmz

&#x200B;

The crown is a symbolic crown, its to play off the recurring theme of ""great power comes with great responsibility.""  In homecoming this idea is played with spidey's suit. In this movie that theme is played with EDITH. EDITH is power(the ability to control stark tech) and the lesson to learn is that this power entails responsibility(""Heavy lies the head that wears the crown""). The whole film is about Peter lying in order to dodge responsibility so he can be with his classmates. He even willingly throws away his inheritance to dodge responsibility. After the first fight with Mysterio he realizes that giving away the crown to keep his friends safe/away from danger through his own lies has backfired and he's defeated. Dies... goes into a cave and is reborn. He strips his stealth suit(identification with deceit) and wears the Netherlands jersey signifying his embodiment of Truth(even the other prisoners were honest). At the end he accepts his responsibilities to retrieve the crown back from deceit/illusion. Peter with his willing acceptance of responsibility and identification with Truth is united with the symbolic Father(Stark). Peter then creates a new suit/identity thats united with the Father(figure). In the climax I think is the pivotal moment. How do we discern Truth. He closes his eyes and trusts his instincts, trusts his heart. In the end, Truth wears the crown.

The writers have to take creative leaps to make it distinctly different from the other spiderman movies. The main thing separating Hollands spiderman is his connection to the MCU...",c7xhmz
ethq4be,">And that lack of trust comes from what? Living under Tony's shadow. Letting go of self-doubt about what? Becoming the next Iron Man.

It comes from being a 16 year old kid that is pretty naive and gullible. It wasn't subtle. He says it out loud.

I respect your opinion and respectfully disagree. I think Spider-Man resolved the conflict of the film in a way only Spider-Man could have

With all due respect, I don't really see a theme of taking on iron man's mantle. The only theme that comes across to me is learning to trust his instincts.

esoepbg,">This isn't comic Peter

Okay? Then why call them Peter Parker or Spider-Man? Were peoples upsetness over the portrayals of Batman and Lex Luthor in the DCEU justified in your opinion?

A character is still typically is expected to follow the archtypes their characters (or in some cases INTENTIONALLY subvert them). The general idea of adapting characters isn't to take things one to one from their works, but find the idea and cores of the character and build stories around those cores. 

What imo is the core of Peter Parker is the inherant weight of responsibility that comes from having super powers in that he can't just tell everyone hes Spider-Man because then everyone will attack Mary Jane or Aunt May in retaliation (like what happened immediatly in comics when he revealed his identity post Civil War). And his responsibility is in protecting people first and foremost which makes it so he is always missing obligations and deadlines and meetings because he has to save the people of New York City and he can never tell people thats why hes late.

It is in the difficulty that he has balancing those lives without letting either one know about the other side that is the truth behind Uncle Bens statement of ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". And letting the world know who Peter is absolves him of that responsibility of keeping his two worlds seperately contained which is the central internal conflict that makes Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

Also, on the topic of the Rogues Gallery, they can still build his rogues gallery with or without Tony Starks shadow, Mysterio could have been a special effects whiz who was stealing various Macguffins accross Shield hesdquarters in Europe, or a jewel thief that Peter had to stop. They could do Chameleon framing Spiderman for theft and robbery only to have it turn out that the reason hes doing it is because Adrian Toomes is paying him from jail or being in hiding after escaping jail with money he had hidden before he was arrested.

The point is that its not like Spiderman has borrowed villains or even only big threat villains, he has plenty of villains that could literally just be introduced in a solo movie or would be perfect for making their first apperance as the villain in a Spiderman solo movie. That's how you build up a Rogues Gallery. It doesn't all need to be based on Tony Stark.",c7xhmz

>First, there were no consequences shown, or are you inventing consequences AFTER the post-credit scenes? Until they show us the consequences to that reveal, there are no consequences. 

Peter Parker's identity was revealed. If you arbitrarily decide that's not a consequence then you're just being dishonest. Not off to a good start.

>Look at the last post-credit scene with Aunt May, absolutely no consequence.

So you're saying Homecoming has no consequences? Cool, I agree with you. That's one reason I like Far From Home better. This is completely besides the point, but okay.

>I bet and hope this Parker won't be villified, as that makes no sense given the popularity of these MCU superheroes.

This is speculation. Also besides the point.

>As for his identity, I'm confident they'll need 10 minutes or less to deal with that, it won't be a big deal, MCU superheroes are already public personas, plus Peter is already taking his mask off whenever anyway.
>

Yeah, or the next villain could try to target Peter's friends and family which could be a whole movie plot. 

I just want to point out that your three arguments for why FFH had no consequences were 1) I'm just going to ignore the consequences 2) another movie didn't have consequences 3) i speculate the next film will resolve this quickly. Not really proving your point

> but some scenes indicate Tony is this sort of important father figure that's wholly unjustified in the scenes we saw, 

Tony has been the de facto father figure to this iteration of Spider Man. Like have you seen Civil War, Homecoming, Infinity War, and Endgame? Peter literally died in Tony's arms. The only reason Tony does anything im Endgame was because he missed Peter. Are you high or something?

This is also beside the point. FFH had nothing to do with Iron Man as a father figure. It had to do with the fact that Iron Man is dead and after Thanos the world wants someone to protect them. Spider Man is being thrust into that position but after being a monumental fuck up in all of his MCU appearances so far he is scared. This is something you would've noticed if you watched the movie and listened to the dialogue. This message wasn't some metaphor hidden in the subtext. The characters say it multiple times. 

>Third, yeah this movie just retreads the themes of Homecoming, of being his own man amidst the hero he looks up to. Both films also involve Peter losing and then regaining his trust in himself, last time due to th suit and this time due to a seemingly more capable Beck.
>

False. Homecoming is about Peter learning his limitations. In Homecoming Peter is constantly getting in over his head because he's eagar and reckless. Then Vulture drops a parkimg garage on him and he realizes that he's not invincible. At the beginning of FFH Peter is completelt different. Instead of blowing up Happy's inbox begging for the next Avengers mission he's literally avoiding Nick Fury because je just wants to raise funds for May's homeless shelter and go on vacation. He doesn't even want to bring his suit, May packs it for him. In Homecoming Peter wants more than anything to be a hero. In FFH he wants more than anything to be a normal person, but everyone else is pushing the hero role onto him. You have to completely ignore the events of both movies to say they retread the themes.

>As for the movie's other failures like the telling/not showing scene in the bar,

If that scene didn't explain what was happening you'd be hete complaining about how improbable Beck's plan was.

Spiderman is *the* marquee Marvel franchise, not Iron Man. It's a waste of his character to serve as Stark's junior. And it completely contradicts the themes we've agreed they were going for the last two movies.

None if we pretend these aren't established characters.  However if you consider 60 years of Spiderman, then the character feels weird and fucked with.  Like someone didn't care about the details.

It's really shitty in this respect because they can basically fuck with something and as a fan you complain about the details but then people can ignore your perspective as a fan and say you're only saying things because of racism.

> So you're saying Homecoming has no consequences? Cool, I agree with you. That's one reason I like Far From Home better. This is completely besides the point, but okay.

How is far from home any different? Stop inventing consequences we weren't shown yet. As of right now, there are no consequences.

> This is speculation. Also besides the point.

I agree, fair enough. But it's not besides my point, which is that most post-credit scenes are fluff and mostly serve to introduce characters.

Also speculation, but at least mine was based on Homecoming's precedence with post-credit scenes. Same with most MCU post-credit scenes, really.

Yeah, like I said in that quote, that portrayal is wholly unjustified in the scenes we saw.

And yes, I've seen Civil War, then Homecoming which really regressed Peter's character in Civil War, then I saw Infinity War with Peter now solidly an Avenger and him being happy about finally being 'in' (but not at all the fatherhood stuff, unless that's how shallowly you thought of fathers and sons LOL), then Endgame, which was (like you said) much more about Tony's guilt about Peter than Peter's feelings. 

So what now?

> This is also beside the point. FFH had nothing to do with Iron Man as a father figure. It had to do with the fact that Iron Man is dead and after Thanos the world wants someone to protect them. Spider Man is being thrust into that position but after being a monumental fuck up in all of his MCU appearances so far he is scared. This is something you would've noticed if you watched the movie and listened to the dialogue. This message wasn't some metaphor hidden in the subtext. The characters say it multiple times.

And tell the film that, because it's really leaning on that father figure angle in those two scenes while ignoring it the rest of the film. And after Thanos the world has lots of heroes to protect them, Peter is right, they don't need him to do anything more than he already was doing. LOL you just reminded me of yet another flaw with this movie. Hell, this was a world-ending threat, and where are the rest of the superheroes? You'd have thought there'd be at least one guy who can fly out to Europe. Then again, this is a consistent weakness with most MCU films.

Oh and for the record, Spider-man has done a great job in all his films, except for this one where he was portrayed as incompetent for half the film, and dumb for the bar scene. The rest of the time he was great as usual. Did you really think I just zoned out watching this film? Don't make me laugh.

Edit: Let's complete this, and then I'm done.

> False. Homecoming is about Peter learning his limitations. In Homecoming Peter is constantly getting in over his head because he's eagar and reckless. Then Vulture drops a parkimg garage on him and he realizes that he's not invincible. At the beginning of FFH Peter is completelt different. Instead of blowing up Happy's inbox begging for the next Avengers mission he's literally avoiding Nick Fury because je just wants to raise funds for May's homeless shelter and go on vacation. He doesn't even want to bring his suit, May packs it for him. In Homecoming Peter wants more than anything to be a hero. 

Limitations? Nope, while that scene happened, the lesson he actually learned that he is still Spider-man without the suit. You forgot the most pivotal scene?

If anything, this movie was about responsibility, and him not trusting himself is related to his emotional issues and 'Fury' uncharacteristically badgering him about his responsibilities (no idea where you got that Peter really cared about raising funds for FEAST, it's just one scene, and Happy was more than happy enough to give the check away. No struggle). 

> In FFH he wants more than anything to be a normal person, but everyone else is pushing the hero role onto him. You have to completely ignore the events of both movies to say they retread the themes.

But I'm not ignoring those events. LOL sure in Homecoming he was eager and in Far from Home he was reluctant, but both films traced an arc where he lost trust in himself and then regained it.

> If that scene didn't explain what was happening you'd be hete complaining about how improbable Beck's plan was.

Isn't the point of showing, not telling, to SHOW? Why would I complain if they gave us the information beter? And thanks for sidestepping my legitimate complaint, that's just acknowledging it's true.

> I don't even know what to say. I guess Iron Man's suit and mjolnir are plot devices too

Why would I say that? Stop with the bullshit, EDITH is problematic for many reasons. Read the comments before us to highlight some of them.

> Who?

Pick one - MJ, Ned, Betty, that kid who wasn't snapped, the teachers, 'Nick Fury', 'Maria Hill', Aunt May, Happy, every villain except Beck. All weak characterization. Not saying they all should be well-developed, but I want more of them to be so. Even side characters with more lines like MJ were just the same as their previous iteration. I never bought why Peter liked her now when he was indifferent the previous movie. Then again, his massive crush came out of nowhere too.

> These are movies based on comic books. Were you expecting an arthouse film or something? Do you think the Raimi films are like high art or something?

Nope, and the first two Raimi films were really good, yes. Along with Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Thor Ragnarok, and Infinity War. Also, dunno what's your issue with arthouse films, do you think good films are limited to those? Who cares if they're based on comic books, some comic books are really well-made and top quality, just like some novels, some films, and some tv shows.

But that's not how the movie was done, Thor just saved the world and we got no mention of anyone else. With Black Panther as well it'd have been easy to have T'challa try to contact the exterior and bring some people in, since Kill Monger getting access to all the vibranium weapons would certainly cause a world war with millions of dead the didn't break the immersion by mentioning other heroes.

But if it's any help to you, this Spiderman movie was explicitly done as a sequel to Endgame. They even talk about that on interviews I think ,and it's also clear from the tone. For starters it starts with a video about the fallen Avengers, this movie is right after the apocalypse caused by Thanos where they all fought together, so try to forgive a Peter wanting to go on a vacation asking for all of these other dudes he fought along 8 months ago better suited for fighting Elemental gods. 
Remember this isn't exactly a problem he got himself into, Nick Fury just dragged him along because there was no one else.

Also, in the comics, Spider-Man actually appears. Peter is a minor character. In this movie, Spider-Man is barely in it.

etwa3xv,">There's no movie yet to show the consequences, I'm not arbitrarily doing anything. LOL you're the one assuming that the consequences would be devastating.

Ok, you can say they weren't devasting. It was still a consequence

>
>How is far from home any different? Stop inventing consequences we weren't shown yet. As of right now, there are no consequences.
>

So let explain to the concept of a consequence. It's like what happens as a result of another event. So of you watch Far From Home really closely, you'll notice the consequence of the whole plot was Peter having his identity revealed. You can say Homecoming had no consequences but it really didn't. Nothing really changed. And you didn't need to wait 3 years for Far From Home to realize that. As a direct result (which is a synonym for consequence in case you weren't following) Peter's identity is revealed. I don't need to see the next film to see that the character's actions had a consequence. So yes, you literally are just ignoring the consequence to make your case.

>I agree, fair enough. But it's not besides my point, which is that most post-credit scenes are fluff and mostly serve to introduce characters. 
>

Yeah, but this mid-credit scene was actually a conclusion to the story. This is even further beside the point.

>Also speculation, but at least mine was based on Homecoming's precedence with post-credit scenes. Same with most MCU post-credit scenes, really.
>

And my speculation is based on common Spider Man comic tropes. It also just happened in the Spider Man PS4 game too. If you can speculate about future films then so can I and it's equally valid. Either we're both wrong or we're both right.


>How can you lie like this? LOL me saying there was literally nothing after the post-credits to show any consequence is reality. If you can't accept facts like that, stop right now.
>

You're the one lying, to yourself. The fact is the film has a consequence that will change the status quo for the next movies featuring Spider Man.


>
>No, I also argued how *this* movie had none. Remember that Aunt May thing? The consequences of THAT were supposed to be in THIS movie. Got it? But hey, enough about that scene, I'll wait for any other sort of heavy consequence from you.
>

You know what happened between the Aunt May Scene and Far From Home? Thanos wiped out half the universe and Iron Man died. The film very much deals with the consequences of those events. But this logic you're using is really stupid. Are you going to tell me Endgame had no consequences until Peter's High School's eulogy? If this is your defintion of consequences then it holds no water because the entire plot of the movie is a consequence of Iron Man's death. 

If Homecoming had a consequence, which I agree it didn't, it would've been in that movie. If you're going to FFH had no consequences because it didn't pick up where Homecoming left off, then I don't know what to tell you other than  movies don't work that way. Stories don't work that way.

>No the point of that was to show *you* were just speculating, and if we're gonna play that bullshit game, my speculations are gonna be more grounded in the films we've seen before.

Ok, well by that logic, the last two movies with this Spider-Man in it saw him die and be the primary motivation for Iron Man to give his life to save the world. That story arc took almost 6 hours to resolve, which is a little bit longer than 10 minutes.",c7xhmz

Endgame does not reflect this optimism to begin with. Contingencies are for worst-case scenarios, and planning for the that would make much more sense.

And even then, I'm not gonna randomly invent all these stories about Ironman inventing contingencies for all sets of outcomes, not when he can't even invent contingencies for EDITH being used against Peter, given the events of both Winter Soldier and Ultron.

And I don't understand how you think my criticism reflects some lack of appreciation, that's just nonsense dismissal.",c7xhmz
etiluf3,"It's not really about the film revolving around Iron Man, but the film doing so why saying it's about Peter being his own man. The inconsistencies are one of the biggest issue with this film, and that is not gonna stop with future MCU movies, as there're too many masters to serve.

In fact, I'm confused why people say this is the definitive or comic-accurate Peter, when he is clearly based off of Miles Morales - non-poor household, bestfriend like Ganke Lee, young aunt, non-awkward and overall popular. He is a superhero fanboy, just like Miles. Peter Parker is Miles's mentor, as Iron Man was to this Peter.

The thing with Peter B. Parker is he is constantly getting shit on by life, that his personal life always suffers because of the things he does as Spider-Man. This MCU Peter has EDITH, so 90% of his daily life responsibilities should be easily solved by EDITH plus his personal connections to Happy and Nick Fury. He will not have further issues juggling his Peter and Spider personas from his friends and loved ones. No issues surrounding his secret identity, which isn't a big deal in the MCU to begin with. I doubt they can realistically turn the public against him, given the popularity of superheroes in the MCU (goodluck JJJ).

Look at Joker, what does his themes and character say about Batman and his themes and character? Same thing with Magneto to Xavier, Loki to Thor, Thanos to Iron Man (and others).

et6wrg5,"Sorry, I'm juggling like 6 different thread with other bigot trolls like yourself so it's hard to keep track. Name three movies with black characters that are not slaves, not about oppression, or not about being rescued by white people with no backlash.

Also, you being oblivious to the racist backlash against this iteration of MJ is bigotry by definition. But we've already established you don't read much so I'll give you a pass there",c7xhmz
eteufiv,"So to you, my statement that Edith is a back up plan is a rationalization? So it would also be acceptable to you that Stark's primary plan is to die and leave everything to someone else after Thanos? 

The second one isn't a rationalization either, based on what we're shown in the movies. How many suits does the guy have? How many versions of Jarvis? The guy comes from selling weapons and defense systems. It would be insanely out of character to not plan for different eventualities.",c7xhmz

eto8nqx,"There was a line about Uncle Ben when Peter explained his motivation to Tony in Civil War, and another when he explained May's situation to Ned in Homecoming. Those are two situations related to Ben, and the lines were there. 

But in FFH, you are saying you'd like to include a scene in just so there could be a mention? Why? How long Batman's adventures should include references to his dead parents? Does every single adventure had to have a mention even when there's nothing calling for it?

Just notice how you wanted him to appear on Mysterio's illusions even when it made no sense for him to be there:
Mysterio is no Batman's Scarecrow. There are video footage of Peter wearing the home-made Spider-Man suit, surely also the Homecoming suit, and Tony's death is public knowledge, but how you'd explain him knowing all the Uncle Ben's deal to put him in his illusions? That's the problem, you want Uncle Ben in so much you'd like him to be even when it doesn't make a lot of sense for him to be.",c7xhmz

This time he only earned confidence not responsability per se",c7xhmz
etfv5uk,"At this point, I'm not really sure what you expected. They didn't want the plot of Homecoming to have much to do with MJ, so they kept her on the side until Liz was out of the way. They skipped over half a year because the story they wanted to tell featured vacation and budding romance. They summarized the semester, and the events of the blip, because fans would probably complain if they didn't acknowledge the Snap's affect on school life, even though it wasn't a plot point that the writers wanted to dwell on.",c7xhmz

esnafln,"But that's not really true, they know Tony Stark wasn't the genesis of the suffering. They know Tony Stark didn't attack them, they had clear misplaced rage. Panther had misplaced rage aimed at Bucky.......do you think Panther was justified in his feelings? Misplaced rage is a thing, but it doesn't make it justified. 

This being obvious when they got over it so fast. If you truly believe someone killed your parents you don't just get over it. Tony didn't just get over Cap protecting his parents killer. In the beginning of Infinity War Tony was very hesitant to call Cap because clearly Tony wasn't over it yet.",c7xhmz
etga810,"You can't tell me how, as a fan. I should behave.  MJ is not real and therefore can be whatever race, ethnicity, religion what-have you. You not liking something because the skin is different is the definition of being a racist. So therefore you can bite me.",c7xhmz
etgnfpq,That is a fair point to make but I don't accept it because this character replaces Mary Jane Watson.,c7xhmz
etg63cg,Umm? We did see mysterio take on that role? Did you even watch the movie?,c7xhmz
etxdqjp,"Just gonna poke my head in here real quick- the problem with Far From Home’s identity consequence is that although, yes it is a consequence, we aren’t shown this problem until the end of the movie. We don’t see any consequence for Peter during any other moment until the credits, in a very quick scene. So, there’s not really any consequence in this movie we can really hold on to, just something we’re going to see in about 2 years.",c7xhmz
etggs7b,"It really doesn't matter how many outcomes, every other outcome seems to have a more simple solution since it involves tony still being alive or peter dying. Really not that hard to think laterally when your a genius. As for second guessing if peter would hand it off to someone else he did build a contingency for that since it still worked for peter at the end of the movie even though he gave its control to beck, so yea tony even thought peter might want it back.

You don't have to invent contingencies when thats exactly what edith was and how it was presented in the movie.

>And I don't understand how you think my criticism reflects some lack of appreciation, that's just nonsense dismissal.

when did I say this, your criticism seems more like you just not getting it than actual criticism since you only say things don't make sense.",c7xhmz
etin9wq,"Yes I can agree with you there, but now with tony gone I don’t see marvel continuing that in the future. We kind of needed to close off the whole iron man death thing in this movie, but I definitely see peter getting villains more personal to him in the future. Also if vulture and mysterio come back I can see them developing a more personal conflict with Spider-Man that doesn’t revolve around iron man.",c7xhmz
et0h0f7,"I'm not sure I follow your first point.

As for the second, I think that was just context. They skipped the whole Spider-Man original story (including Uncle Ben) in the MCU because it had already been done on film recently…*twice*. A lot of the criticism Amazing Spider-Man got was for retreading ground already covered in Raimi's Spider-Man, by telling the origin story again. So by the time they were doing a third Spider-Man on film, origin story and Uncle Ben were just too played out.",c7xhmz
