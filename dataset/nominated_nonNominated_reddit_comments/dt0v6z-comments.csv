""Dick also means penis.""
""Our neighbor's name is Dick. Is his name also penis?""

f7u69lt,"I just came out sad, tbh. I didn’t see him being a ghost, I saw him being a product of a severe mental breakdown. The scenes that show of her doing everything alone when she thought she was doing it with him just made me extremely sorrowful for this girl who was deeply ill and completely delusional without even realising it. I felt the movie marketing was completely misleading and felt quite cheated out of my Christmas cheer hah.",dt0v6z
f70obd4,Did anyone else think Tom was going to end up being Santa's dead son and that is why she kept giving Kate all those chances at the shop? And that she knew that Kate was living with Tom's heart.  That would have been over the top even for this movie.,dt0v6z

f70yy2l,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had plenty of rom com-xmas movie tropes and plenty of laughs. >!While I did suspect he was a ghost, I expected it to be more like ""the ghost of xmas past"" kind of thing, and he would somehow find a way to become human and be with her. What I did NOT see coming was that the heart was his and he was the donor. The fact they didnt end up together, for obvious reasons, and that he was very much dead, really made it bittersweet for me.!< Had it not been for that, this movie would have ended up as a must have and must re-watch many times.",dt0v6z

f6ve04s,"Saw it tonight and it wasn't that bad. A piece of fluff but not too bad as far as pieces of fluff go.  Emilia Clarke is very charismatic and shines. Michelle Yeoh practically steals the movie. Some of the jokes fell flat at my showing but the audience seemed to eat it up.

I had a few problems with it - shoehorning some of the George Michael songs into places that don't quite line up and the bit about xenophobia seemed really out of place in what is supposed to be a light comedy.

The big twist you could see coming a mile away though.  (Last Christmas I gave you my heart... literally.)",dt0v6z
f6vvnml,"I want to watch a movie where I can finally have a good laugh, a bit of crying and feel better with myself in the end.. I think this one would do😍

f91gqek,"I just saw this movie and quite honestly I don't give a shit about the plot. Emilia Clarke smiling, being silly and wholesome needs to be its own genre with like a thousand movies. I can't get enough and she fills me with joy.

To edit in some actual thoughts lol. I really didn't give a damn about the ""relationship"" because it was just too obvious it was just a conduit for her to be better. On the other hand her relationship with Santa and her mom were the actual highlights. It was a cute story and I found it endearing that the lyrics quite are literally the movie. It was time well spent I love these flicks.",dt0v6z

f7de9kd,"""Lesbian Pudding""

-Emma Thompson, 2019

but really though, I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It actually had a lot of heart and a few pretty funny lines. Cheesy but Clarke fully committed to it so that was fun. Batshit insane 'twist' but it didn't really derail it like a big twist like that sometime does (looking at you, *Serenity*).

f8uagct,"Idk how obvious it was for everyone else but i’m pretty proud of myself for putting two and two together early on. The two things that did it for me was in the beginning when he’s dodging/dancing around the people walking by, the people didn’t react at all to a random dude seemingly jumping in front of them. And Tom saying to stop depending on him confirmed it for me

And i’ll be honest, the lesbian pudding got a laugh outta me",dt0v6z
fh57myu,"\*Spoilers ahead\*Before watching this movie I've only heard that there would be a twist. Haven't seen the trailer and generally tried to avoid any spoilers (as with any movie really). I have to say I got immersed into the movie so much, the characters were charming and fun, it was like a typical rom-com.I did take notice of some stuff that was off about Tom e.g. when he swirled to dodge the man, the man just kept going like he didn't even see that but I really didn't give it much thought. Knowing there would be a twist however I thought maybe there would be a problem with her transplanted heart or something like that, worst case scenario she would die.

Come the scene where she talks to the realtor, and the twist unfolds (combined with the piano melodramatic music) I was genuinely shocked to the point that I fucking felt heartbroken. I even shed a tear which pretty much never happens while watching movies for me. This was just completely unexpected and having been through some tough stuff recently (not a bad breakup but something of a similar impact) it hit a chord.Of course in hindsight it makes sense just looking at the title and the lyrics but it truly caught me off guard. The movie had a beautiful message and it also got me thinking what it would be like living with a transplanted heart, something I've never thought of.   
All in all not at all what I expected (in a good way), I am however a bit down because I'll never be able to experience it again without knowing the twist, that's how much I enjoyed it.",dt0v6z

fc2pa50,"Did not see “the trailer” (aka the thing—or, the top comment—that may have spoiled the film for some) until after I saw the movie.

Held out to see it as a feel good thing, but it turns out this is not your typical Christmas movie.

Devastated. Such that the remaining film, I could hardly think about the denouement. I can “ha ha” about it now but I went in for an easy romantic comedy. This one is a bit more serious than that. It made for a...memorable...Christmas Day.

But. As a result...I:

Found out Emily Clarke was on a television show, and not just “that girl from the Terminator movie”.

She also wrote an amazing article this year about her life story, which is super inspiring.

She has an organization to help those needing brain rehabilitation.

Reminded that we can be of help to others even in just one act.

Reminded that George Michael died of a heart problem 3 years ago—on Christmas.

So. I learned a bit. I felt, a lot. Inspired.

Will see again. Loved it.

Would love to know how many people went in with a feeling about it, and still left with...a feeling...about it.",dt0v6z

f7gnvm6,"1) as someone who watches Korean Dramas, called the twist so early on. Apparently it's a trend to do heart transplant korean dramas now.

f77dtd0,"This movie is a...charming mess? 

There's a lot of pieces I really like. Emilia Clarke is really doing a great performance here especially cause she's channeling a lot of her public health scares into the part. She's got really great chemistry with Henry Golding. It's shot decently, I love the reoccurring theme of George Michael music throughout the story, there's a scene I was legitimately touched by when the two talk on the floor of Henry's apartment.

However story wise there's too many things going on at once. The editing is kinda sloppy that makes the pacing really awkward. There's a Brexit plotline, there's a lot about homelessness, they are pulling heavy on the Eastern European stereotypes with Emma Thompson, there's Michael Yoeh's love interest who is just really random and quiet, there's the sister who is a lawyer and also has a lesbian relationship kept under wraps. The movie just has too many things going on and barely enough time to do any of it. So while I like the core aspect of the plot, it doesn't have much laughs or content to really make it work.

I was really impressed with Paul Fieg after seeing ""A Simple Favor"" so I was a bit disappointed he just made a really glossy Hallmark movie (with melodrama and all) that didn't really add anything new to the mix.",dt0v6z
f8ukcyr,"Honestly, I feel like Tom’s character was a hallucination she was having since he wasn’t there and kept coming and going, etc. it reminded me of A Beautiful Mind where John Nash’s roommate and others aren’t real and just a byproduct of his condition. Idk, whenever she was talking about being messed up in the head that’s where I saw it going but it didn’t go there at all. Also like other people have mentioned it didn’t go into a lot of the heart transplant stuff either so it was hard for me to make a connection. It was a decently sweet movie but honestly weird in some areas",dt0v6z
faklgqj,"Well I actually enjoyed it, it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously buif you go into it expecting an Oscar winner you'll probably be let down, but it was a fun little movie, Emilia Clarke is gorgeous and play her character perfectly, some good laughs too...and the twist, I can usually see a twist coming from a mile away, and I knew we were heading towards one here too...but I thought Henry's character was actually going to turn out to be one of the homeless people!",dt0v6z

fa46kr5,"Utterly abysmal. A disgrace to call this the ""next Love Actually"". And what the fuck was up with that weirdo who was hitting on Santa?

Then they talked about the heart surgery, and then I figured it was maybe his wife that died and the heart went to Kate, and maybe he was keeping tabs on her to see what kind of life she was leading with his wife’s heart. 

I was half right on both of them kinda, he was a ghost and the heart was personal to him.",dt0v6z

I did notice weird things...like I thought it was strange that this perfect human didn’t offer to help with her suitcase. That made me think “this guy is not who he seems to be,” but I didn’t predict the twist. 

Overall a fine movie...but like many have said, very Lifetimesque. I have AMC A-List so I’m not disappointed I went.",dt0v6z
f745guq,It was alright... my one critique though... how do you have a rom-com with George Michael music and NOT play Careless Whisper?!?!?,dt0v6z
f6ve67f,"Okay so going in to this movie a friend of mine told me he had this wild theory that Golding was a ghost and that this movie is a literal interpretation of the song that involves him being a heart donor. I knew nothing about this movie other than Thompson wrote it and the cast. So imagine my surprise when he starts dodging people who aren't moving for him I was like holy shit I think he's right. 

And that aspect of it was kind of interesting? It's a really weird movie to try and read into. I suppose after her transplant she wasn't feeling quite herself because a literal part of herself has been taken away. So her Golding hallucinations were not only her body coping with her new heart, but also this new part of her urging her to carry his torch of goodness and, in doing so, reconnect with her friends and family and make amends and just overall get her shit together. 

Okay, that's neat I suppose, but the bummer of it is that the movie just isn't that great. Like it has its moments where it's doing well, but they're short glimmers. For the most part everything needed to be either two points funnier or two points more emotional. The beats just weren't landing. And even though Clarke and her mad brows were doing great, the side characters were falling a little flat and the humor just wasn't very consistent. 

I mean, I didn't even really know what the movie was about until halfway through. It was just generally about how her life is shit and this weirdo keeps popping up. Wasn't much driving force or stakes behind it. And then it starts coming together when it starts feeling like an episode of The Good Place with her trying to be better, and it achieves an okay third act with a cute ending, but getting there should have been a lot more fun. 

Emma Thompson was the funniest character. But in the end this Elf/Ghost/John Q blend didn't really do it for me. I mean, look, I've got worse things to do than watch Emilia Clarke be a cute mess in an elf outfit for two hours, but I just expected more out of the writing. 

5/10 and only because someone had the tenacity to translate a movie script out of arguably the best Christmas song.

fal89ht,"I didn't think too much of possible twists, so yeah, a tearjerker for me. Ultimately, a very wholesome movie, and, as I am a sucker for romcoms, I went home really satisfied.

Only criticism for me - the George Michael songs here and there. They somehow managed to be not enough to be taken seriously and too much in some scenes. I think this movie would've worked fine with maybe just the last christmas and some of Kate's recital songs from childhood.

Even so, I at least hoped for my fave GM christmas song - the December song. Still, loved it.",dt0v6z

 It was meant to be a romcom cheesy/corny Christmas movie and it delivered. 7/10",dt0v6z
f787hv3,"It was charming at the start. Neon lights, Christmas vibe, immigrant bitterness, millennial despair. A recipe for a cozy Hallmark movie with a few stars to give it shine. What’s not to like?

Well, there’s the issue of the characters, which are kind of essential to a movie as familiar as this. You know how the narrative ticks. It’s up to the dynamics to give it verve. Paul Feig has a good touch for laughter, so there’s plenty of sparkle on the face of things. (My friend and I were rolling at Michelle Yeoh’s love at first sight — a good leg to start on.) But the flash dwindles as the movie wears on, and at the core there isn’t much left to warm me. There’s Emilia Clarke, a lovely wreck; Emma Thompson, full of motherly fuss; some other cardboard people filling sound and space… and Henry Golding, the somewhat less than love interest, smiling dashingly and dropping wisdom and supporting a human disaster with superhuman grace, standing handsomely by while his natural charm cooks down bland as his oatmeal coat.

That’s where the heart goes haywire. We spend so much time and feeling with Emilia and Henry, but Henry isn’t anybody. He’s shallow as a glass. He has no personhood. He’s nothing more than a crucible for her growth. This isn’t a wholly new thing for a romantic lead in an Emilia Clarke movie: Sam Claflin was that crucible in *Me Before You*. But Sam spent his screentime *feeling* like more, airing fury and hurt, revealing desires at odds with his lover’s, standing firm despite her desperate cracks at overhauling his mind. Within the story, he felt tragically, exasperatingly human, though in the eyes of the storyteller he existed as a device to drive her forward. 

Henry isn’t allowed that solidity. He’s the threadbare dream of an emotional support animal, ever selfless and sympathetic and devoid of personal drive. And yes, that makes sense within the story. But is it any fun for us? The thrill of predictable schmaltz like this is in the characters, and Henry Golding isn’t a character at all. The twist doesn’t hit because you always suspect he’s less than real.

Imagine Henry Golding as more of a ghost than a hallucination: an imprint of soul with enough independent being to challenge Emilia Clarke. Imagine him tied to Earth by his heart in her body, falling in love while anguishing over his own restless death. Imagine him as a genuine romantic lead with interiority and personality and desire… and already you’ll have imagined more than Hollywood ever has, for in their minds men like Henry Golding don’t get to play real lovers to women like Emilia Clarke.

Shame. Our movies suffer for their failing. *Last Christmas* kicks off all right, but by the end everyone involved deserves to be in something with more zest.",dt0v6z
f7fgelt,"This was a cute and charming movie. Emilia Clarke was adorable throughout. The twist was pretty predictable (especially if you watch the trailer), but I enjoyed it for the most part.

f6wdfdl,"This was a misfire for me, and I say that as a big fan of most Feig films. We ended up going to an advanced screening; I would not have gone if I had first seen a Rotten Tomatoes score (even though I have A-List). Our crowd didn't laugh or react much. 

SPOILERS AHEAD OF COURSE: Most of all, Golding should have been a co-lead, not the supporting character swinging by here and there. My main suggestion is that the movie shouldn't have saved the twist and instead made it a main plot point ala Just Like Heaven. Make Golding a point-of-view character. Show us his mission to help Clarke, show us more of his flashback life and maybe his ghost life. Just give us more Golding charm. 


Having gone into it knowing the expected twist, Golding's character actually was way too obvious and weird! Why was he cagey about his phone (yes he had it in the cupboard, but also like, he would check it here and there obviously if he was alive, or know his phone number offhand)? Why did he act so weird about his life? Why is no one else talking to him? Why is he spinning around people? It was too strange to hide the twist for the sake of a twist. Bad storytelling decision. 

All the characters aside from Emilia's main character weren't fleshed out enough. Definitely could have used more dialogue/jokes from Michelle Yeoh, more scenes from her sister, and her parents. And Emilia did what she could, but her character was tough to stick with throughout her tough times. ",dt0v6z

faee43q,"I was 100% off the wagon in the first five seconds when it opened with the exposition “Yugoslavia, 1999.”

Yugoslavia was dissolved in 1992. There was a lot of time to catch this one.

I’m sure most viewers don’t even read the exposition let alone know about the bloody dissolution of the Slavic union. But it’s an episode of history I care deeply about. And everything about the timeline of the movie hinges on one glaring historical inaccuracy and it drove me crazy the whole movie.

htv4ib3,"The movie was pleasant enough, but the Croatian connection seems forced, and for anyone who knows the region that timeline doesn't make any sense. They supposedly left Ex-Yugoslavia (what part isn't made clear exactly) ""because of the war"", but the only conflict still going on there in 1999 (when the family is still there in the opening scene) was the NATO bombing of targets in Serbia in order to get the Serbs to lay off Kosovo, and that was definitely over by Christmas of that year.

Also, Kate is 28 in 2017, meaning that that she was 12 in 1999. Why, as an adult, does she speak Croatian \[the Netflix subtitles alternative between calling it Croatian and Serbo-Croatian\] with a thick English accent? It's basically her native language if it's all she spoke up to age 12 - it should still be fluent and accent-free as an adult.

f8tbcxv,"I saw the movie a few days ago and liked it a lot, even though i find Paul Feig's agenda-driven work and comedic style insufferable most times.

I liked the plot more and more as time went on. I did enjoy the intro scenes that established Kate/Katrina's history and current situation, and liked how they established early that she's obsessed with George Michael (hence creating a theme to the story that fits the title), but for the first quarter of the movie it really seemed like the reviews were gonna be correct that this is a bland cookie-cutter rom-com meant for easy holiday-season money.

However I grew more intrigued with what was happening between Kate and Tom, and I noticed peculiar patterns. I first suspected something when he started disappearing more and more as she was working on herself. That opened the doors for the ""ghost/hallucination"" theory.

The first sign, however, that I felt this theory was possibly true was when Kate goes inside the homeless shelter for the first time to look for him. The fact that none of the volunteers knew who he was at all, despite him saying he worked there, set off alarms. Now granted, I also felt it's possible that he lied as a trick to get her in the building to volunteer, but either way that's when I first suspected something was up.

Also, I found it weird that Santa asked Kate about Tom, speaking of him as if she's seen him too. I don't recall Kate talking about looking at him through windows, so can anyone tell me if they remember Santa seeing him? Please let me know.

Anyway the thing that REALLY convinced me Tom was a ghost/hallucination was when, after Kate had her life pretty much back together, she hadn't seen him for weeks, and she was worried, and all of a sudden she sees him in that part, and during the conversation they have he said ""you can't depend on me"". I had known through the way the movie played out from middle to now that this wasn't going to be a typical rom-com, so it would have been cheesy to make him out to be a deadbeat who needed fixing, especially since she was the deadbeat and the one who needed to be ""fixed"" and he was the therapist to her. It was then I knew that the plot twist was incoming. She needed him less and less and he appeared less and less, so it only made sense

Many seem to hate it, but I really liked the plot twist. It fit with the overall plot of the movie, didn't feel out of character, and it's also an atypical twist in a romantic comedy.

As for the rest of the movie itself, I liked it a lot. Funny in a lot of parts, the characters were very relatable even with outlandish quirks some had, and the story made sense overall. My favorite aspect was Emilia Clarke's acting, but that's also what drove me to see the film in the first place. The acting was great from all the actors and actresses, especially Emma Thompson and the woman who played Santa. 

Pretty much the only negative that stood out was the political commentary/statements about Brexit. I wasn't surprised at all given it was a Paul Feig movie and he has to insert politics into all his work lately, and ultimately those parts drew nothing more than an eyeroll from me, but overall I felt that Kate's family being established as immigrants was already completed and the extra commentary took away from the plot, as well as potentially divide audience members unnecessarily (im sure some pro-Brexit supporters watched it too). On top of the obvious political leaning in the message, it was also inaccurately portrayed, because the immigration issue is focused mostly on Muslim and Middle Eastern immigrants when it comes to the ""Britain First"" movement. Sure theres a pocket group that only wants British people, but the majority of them support immigrants from the rest of Europe just fine.

Anyway, to sum it all up, it wasn't perfect, and it's not the next ""Love, Actually"", but it's a damn fine Christmas Rom-Com that I'm considering buying when it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray",dt0v6z

The truth, that he was her heart donor, turned the movie into a pretty Hallmark level plot. 
This movie had so much potential and so much going for it (hello Game of Thrones-Crazy Rich Asians mashup of my dreams, Emma Thompson, London, all the George Michael songs one could ever desire, Christmas, Patti LuPone, Sue from Great British Bake Off, I could go on...) but ultimately fell pretty flat. 
The beginning was actually pretty funny and the set up was great, the plot just never developed past surface level and I found myself not really caring about anyone. Too many clichés, too many social issues crammed into one movie, too much sauerkraut.

There were some moments that they tried to insert some important themes, like racism etc., but they didn't handle it well, it felt like preaching. They handled the ""don't waste your life"" theme much better.

However, I very much disliked the twist at the end. Come on, really? The movie was very optimistic to have a twist like that. I wanted to see Clarke's character to stand on her own, living her life, regaldess of having someone in her life or not (which I think is a good message), but I didn't want that guy to be just an imaginary advisor, I don't think Clarke's character needed this.

f6we6nq,"I cannot and will not condone two love interests staring deeply into each other’s eyes, singing some George Michael song in harmony, then KISSING, even if, umm, hmm...that person is a ghost? 

I wanted to like this movie and have my feel goods, but this film is why these movies have gone the way of the buffalo. How did this get funded and made in 2019? could have been on streaming easily. 

I wanted to support it. I paid and took myself to a local theater. I love Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding is hot. London is delightful. George Michael is entertaining. I fucking love Christmas. All recipes for success. I want these movies to be made more often because they are important! people like them! it can’t all be RDJ in a robot suit yadda yadda.

then... by the one hour mark I was checking my phone to see what time it was and why nothing was really happening.

The film does have nice sentiments and messages but overall it’s something akin to Always Be My Maybe, which I’d argue is the better film because it feels more authentic and is funnier. This is closer to a hallmark fluff piece I’d turn the channel from.

HG’s character is never really fleshed out. Some might say that’s ok bc he’s *not real* but I’d hard disagree. Is this a comment on how women in these movies never get full personalities? I don’t think so but let’s just go with that. What do I know about you, charming Henry? You keep your smart phone locked up and are organized. 

Emilia’s character is sweet and she does a good job of being a messy/flawed human who is still endearing which is great. Fuck ups deserve second chances and love. Trauma is real and affects us all in different ways. 

The family story lines and homeless commentary were a little hamfisted but we are in a holiday romance so that’s whatever. Didn’t bother me. 

Why actually bothered me was the other terrible, awful cliche of the scar being gently caressed. I had flashbacks to boy band fanfic I read as an 11 year old. Please don’t caress the scars. 


Um overall 4/10. Enjoyable easy watch but if we’re comparing it to the gold standard of love actually or the other big romantic holiday films it doesn’t look great.

Don’t be like me and watch in an empty theater (except for 1 couple who were making a baby in the back row, I’m pretty sure) and waste $23 on a ticket and 3 beers. Stay home. Be warm. Watch a Nora Ephron movie with some tea.",dt0v6z

I didn't even care how much critics hate it cause I still liked Bohemian Rhapsody despite the bad reviews. I thought that was the case- boy I was wrong. It was neither rom-com nor comedy, I felt like watching hallmark channel as soon as the sauerkraut boy showed up. I know this movie was dedicated to George Michael and the messages are good- but his songs were used ineffectively ( lyrics don't match the scenes ), too many characters/issues made everything blur. As some people stated, I really wish they made this movie a ghost love story focusing on two main characters. I wanted to know more about Tom's background, how he lived his life, etc,.

Someone asked Paul Feig on twitter ""perhaps a prequel ? "" then Henry Golding answered ""I'm free next Christmas"" lol. There is a Korean drama called ""49 Days"" which is about ghost and human love story. It is heartbreaking yet heartwarming, beautiful love story that touches your heart.

Then, Golding turns out to be Santa and the German's son, who she gave up and left behind with the German for some tragic reason, which explains why he's in town too and hanging around the area.  He and his dad both arrived in London together.

Then do the other one about the Sixth Sense heart-transplant, still around Christmas, but she's not an Elf and is instead more of a Scrooge as well as being an absolute mess.  Sort of a Grinch/Scrooge with the Sixth Sense plot twist and the family reconnecting drama.",dt0v6z

Thompson knocked off the ""Love Actually"" musical number.

See the anti-Trump references? I do, however, like the anti-Polish reference. Nobody is above prejudice. That needed to be said.

The homeless plot probably  would’ve been better. There were also a million subplots that they never circled back to, all creating a very confusing and choppy narrative. 
A few outstanding items that bothered me that I can’t stop thinking about:
1. Remember when that guy made a really dramatic entrance into the Christmas shop and you assumed there was a history there but then there wasn’t and then that story line was never completed?

2. We got no context into why she loves George Michael 

3. A phone was seriously sitting in a cabinet after a full year in an already cleaned out apartment?

Bland, unoffensive, with a couple of funny moments but overall not very interesting.

Saw the twist coming a mile off (way back when the trailer came out even), but it still shocked some in the (absolutely packed) cinema when the reveal happened.

Not entirely sure why they built the movie around George Michael songs, it appears to have nothing to do with him other than the lead character being a fan of his music (and yes, I’m aware of the play on the chorus of Last Christmas. Did they write a movie just around that?). I suppose it in that case it makes sense that the main storyline is happening in her head considering we only hear her favourite music.

5/10 for me. Nothing offensively bad, a couple of funny moments and made the girl I go to the cinema with happier than The Irishman and Doctor Sleep did",dt0v6z
f6vj5xq,"Went to a screening at AMC on 34th Street in NYC on Tuesday. Honestly? It wasn’t bad at all. Saw the trailers this summer, and I wasn’t expecting much, but that ending got me. Was not expecting that, and didn’t suspect a thing throughout the entire film. Apparently, some people on Twitter predicted the “twist” when the first trailer dropped, so I’m glad I steered away from that. I don’t think I would’ve liked it otherwise. The film takes itself literally when it’s described as “Based on the song ‘Last Christmas.’”

I really liked Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson in this one. My theater and myself laughed at every one of the jokes. That’s another thing: this movie is so much more than a holiday rom-com. There’s queer representation and Brexit talks, which didn’t feel forced because it was contemporary (2017/2016 London). Maybe it was necessary so that it wasn’t just a rom-com or maybe it was necessary to add some character depth to Kate’s family. Idk. Emilia Clarke was great too! I’ve never seen anything she’s been in (even GOT, yes), so I can’t really compare her performance to anything, but she was great! I loved her character’s family backstory and background. Speaking of which, I was about to rip on this movie about Tom’s lack of backstory until the twist was revealed. But honestly? Tom could’ve been played by anyone; Henry Goulding’s casting didn’t really make a difference for me. A win for diversity and Asian representation, but still.

Overall, I liked it. Maybe 7 out of 10. Didn’t dislike too much about it, but it didn’t totally amaze me either. Would I have paid to see it? Probably not, but I’m glad I got to watch it in a theater. Quite a difference between critics’ opinion and audience opinion. Don’t go into this expecting anything groundbreaking. It’s a “feel good” type film for the holidays, and yes, it accomplished its goal imo. Great work, Paul Feig.",dt0v6z

While I genuinely enjoyed the inclusiveness of the cast and characters in this movie, the screenplay tried entirely too hard to fit in every social issue under the sun creating an absolute mess:


* Anxiety and depression >!in the setting of chronic illness!<
* Xenophobia >!and discrimination against immigrants peri-Brexit!<
* Homelessness >!as acting-out vs. necessity (the implication when we find the realtor that perhaps Tom wasn't a volunteer but shelter resident)!<
* Homophobia and intolerance >!with the older sister's girlfriend/flatmate being a secret from her parents!< 

The only inclusions that felt natural to be were >!the doctor, the homeless center director, and Kate's depression now that she's no longer 'special'!< because they were either appropriately just good inclusions or explored enough that it didn't felt shoehorned in.
To be honest, all of those issues would be fine if the main character wasn't written initially and stayed as one of the most unlikable characters ever to stray near the rom-com genre. Maybe this film wasn't meant as a classic rom-com and I was misled by the trailers. But between the interesting casting (>!I love Emma Thompson and Emilia Clarke but the accent felt extremely forced on everyone and they kept having to emphasize KATE! to try to remind us...!<), bloated number of issues, and most importantly the ending >!which could have been a great Shyamalan twist if they explored her clear mental breakdown over the past year sensitively, instead of making this weird, maybe-they-met-pre-accident, maybe-she's-genuinely-in-love-with-the-spirit-of-her-organ-donor ambiguity... !< I was happy I didn't leave the theatre mid-movie only because of how absurd of a story I had to describe to my friends and here.

f6x83ez,">This was a misfire for me, and I say that as a big fan of most Feig films. We ended up going to an advanced screening; I would not have gone if I had first seen a Rotten Tomatoes score (even though I have A-List). Our crowd didn't laugh or react much.  

&#x200B;

I guess I'm weird, but if I see a movie has a poor critics' score, I don't usually think about it other than going in with lowered expectations and usually liking it more than I thought I would. Of course, this is after I got A-List otherwise I probably wouldn't actually seek out many of these films. For instance, I didn't think Gemini Man was that bad as the critics made it out to be although it wasn't all that great either.

So I went in with lowered expectations for Last Christmas because of the reviews, but at the same time, I figured it couldn't be that bad because I generally love rom-coms no matter how bad they are, and it's been awhile since one has been out. Unfortunately, it did end up being pretty disappointing. I agree that it was a misfire, and the humor was definitely lacking. 

&#x200B;

>SPOILERS AHEAD OF COURSE: Most of all, Golding should have been a co-lead, not the supporting character swinging by here and there. My main suggestion is that the movie shouldn't have saved the twist and instead made it a main plot point ala Just Like Heaven. Make Golding a point-of-view character. Show us his mission to help Clarke, show us more of his flashback life and maybe his ghost life. Just give us more Golding charm.   
>  
>Having gone into it knowing the expected twist, Golding's character actually was way too obvious and weird! Why was he cagey about his phone (yes he had it in the cupboard, but also like, he would check it here and there obviously if he was alive, or know his phone number offhand)? Why did he act so weird about his life? Why is no one else talking to him? Why is he spinning around people? It was too strange to hide the twist for the sake of a twist. Bad storytelling decision. 

YES!!! 

One of my biggest problems with the film is that I felt like Golding's character really didn't have any reason to exist. >!I have no problem with his character if it would have gone more in depth into Kate's backstory and how she didn't feel like herself after her transplant and that he was there to help her accept that, but I felt that by the time she opens up about that, the movie is almost over and it doesn't really matter. As the story was structured though, I figured he was an angel or ghost, and even if that's cliche, they could have added in something about him trying to help Kate before he's able to go to the afterlife or heaven or whatever. Being a figment of her imagination that just popped up randomly and that she gets over pretty fast once she figures what he really was, seemed like the worst way to go because it doesn't give much depth to Tom or to what Kate is struggling with until near the end. That she had a transplant is only alluded to until the movie is almost over, when it would have made more sense for her and for the audience to have more sympathy for her, if they had made it clear from the beginning that she was suffering ptsd because of having a new heart. !<

&#x200B;

>All the characters aside from Emilia's main character weren't fleshed out enough. Definitely could have used more dialogue/jokes from Michelle Yeoh, more scenes from her sister, and her parents. And Emilia did what she could, but her character was tough to stick with throughout her tough times.  

I feel like Emma Thompson and Greg Wise were trying to do something like Love Actually, but I don't think it worked because you're only focusing in on one character, and even that character doesn't have very much depth at all. The supporting characters were written even worse. I think the actors did their best especially Yeoh, but the story didn't make me care at all about the secondary romance or Kate's family problems.",dt0v6z

f6yhig9,">I'd like to see this movie split into two. Take away the Christmas store stuff and George Michael and put that into a pure rom-com movie that focuses on this quirky guy coming into her life and helping her become a better person. But also, make the German the long lost lover of Santa, trying to get up the nerves to reconnect with her. Then, Golding turns out to be Santa and the German's son, who she gave up and left behind with the German for some tragic reason, which explains why he's in town too and hanging around the area. He and his dad both arrived in London together. 

  
I really like this idea because I wanted to care more about the Santa romance, but the script made it hard to cheer for it because the German guy only got to say two lines I think. Also while Yeoh does her best, she's wasted too. Plus, I think maybe they could have explored why Santa ended up with the shop since she there was like only one throwaway line about her liking Christmas when it could have been a backstory there about how she worked her way up from working from a bakery, to a pet store and so on and on. 

It would have also made the break in and subsequent scene mean something more. I thought it was a poor script that Kate didn't get in trouble again later at work because that happens whenever someone gets one last chance in a movie or television show. Usually it's not the main character's fault, but something happens that their boss or significant other or whatever thinks is their fault, and that ends up being the last straw for them. Instead things went pretty well for Kate despite a few setbacks.

She leaves home and bounces from place to place, but she ends up being able to go back home. Sure her family has problems, but they're pretty minor compared to being homeless or having to go back to an abusive situation or a serious situation like that. She leaves the place where she works unlocked, but Santa breaks a window to cover it up so insurance covers any money that she'll lose. (I guess her boss's insurance would go up, but the movie of course didn't get bogged down into those details.) Then Santa gives Kate one last chance, but nothing ever becomes of it. Some family drama happens, but again pretty minor, and everyone's made up a short time later. 

&#x200B;

>Then do the other one about the Sixth Sense heart-transplant, still around Christmas, but she's not an Elf and is instead more of a Scrooge as well as being an absolute mess. Sort of a Grinch/Scrooge with the Sixth Sense plot twist and the family reconnecting drama.

Imagine ""wrong lever!"" or some shit written on a military memorial or ""get out of the way!"" in serious gold writing..

f710vk2,Haven't seen a movie/show where Emilia Clarke played as herself until now. She has shown she has quite a range from GoT/Terminator. So it's nice to see her in a more cheerful/comedic role that seems like her real life self based on her interviews.,dt0v6z

Of course Brexit is a major issue today, as it was in 2016.  This Brexit plotline would make sense in 2019 London.  So why then does the movie make the deliberate choice of being set in 2017?  Odd.",dt0v6z

Plus he was throwing the extreme ""Britain First"" wing in with Brexit supporters, which is highly inaccurate because those who support Brexit because of immigration issues mostly are concerned with muslim/middle eastern immigration and the development of ""no-go"" zones in various places in London and the surrounding area, and the invasion/changing of western culture via Sharia Law.

There's no way most Brexit supporters are against European Immigrants, which is what the movie was implying.

Honestly this hurt the film a tiny bit because on top of the inaccurate agenda-pushing, it was redundant because we already established Kate's family as immigrants on hard times.

But thankfully there were only a couple scenes that had that agenda, so they mostly only caused me to eyeroll and move on.",dt0v6z
f8wy3zx,"I mean that’s what most of Hollywood is


There’s very few actors without connections that just move to LA and get their big break. Most either have industry connections or are former models and performers",dt0v6z
f7dqqkv,Lol,dt0v6z
fblzka6,Thanks for the spoiler asshole.,dt0v6z
f8tqw0h,"That's where I was going with that, in more words than necessary. He was saying they'd have found eachother anyway and probably fallen in love had he lives

The Guardian angel part meant I feel he was compelled to help her out of that potential love lost",dt0v6z
f8tr0ht,"Lol I literally started dating a guy that treated me like that at xmas last year. Conversation after a few upsetting months went exactly the same as when she called him out on it, except surprise, he really did just have commitment issues lol. So this twist really got me",dt0v6z
f8tce35,Ok... Thank you. It helps me answer whether this was a hallucination or a ghost situation. Still could be either admittedly but ghosts can sometimes be seen by more than one person,dt0v6z
f8tivgc,"I lived in Germany for two years, wasn't like a London getaway or anything haha",dt0v6z
f6wyc3n,"Oh that makes sense. I think it's because George Michael died December 26 2016, so Christmas 2017 was the more George Michael than usual in memoriam.",dt0v6z
f6zp1e2,I just assumed it was probably first written in 2017 and they just never changed the references to the year.,dt0v6z
fixt8dd,"Yeah prople are just like ""i saw it coming"" no you fuvking dodn't.",dt0v6z
f9g4fxl,Ah I didn’t watch the trailer unfortunately,dt0v6z
f7y99ko,"How about another dracarys, CersAY?",dt0v6z
f6vxgiy,Hahaha amazing.,dt0v6z
f8tqh4h,But Santa asked about the boy who was always looking up at stuff,dt0v6z
fabv006,"Ohhh. Yeah, I have no explanation for that.",dt0v6z
f6y5lxr,I literally posted that on Facebook this morning hahaha I said shes absolutely adorable in the movie haha great minds think alike.,dt0v6z
f8vcq79,"I too liked it overall, but found it impossible to ignore. The whole theater would laugh or protest whenever something tied to that was on screen and it was stupidly amusing where it shouldn't have been. I wonder what my experience would have been like if I hadn't focused on that entirely.",dt0v6z
fae1ylf,I at first thought the protagonist's family was Catholic Albanian living in Yugoslavia and would face troubles with Kosovo and the like. But then they turned out to be Croats.,dt0v6z
f6xi71n,"Agreeing with you. Her character wasn't sweet at all, but Emilia Clarke is so damn cute and charismatic that it was difficult to separate her from Kat.",dt0v6z
f76uehe,She probably got everyone to go when she was trying to apologize and make amends to everyone,dt0v6z
f7285um,Now THAT is a movie worth the price of admission. Absolutely gut-wrenching film.,dt0v6z
f75evmi,I did! Haha :),dt0v6z
f9bc99j,"Exactly and it creates a stagnant, formulaic vacuum and we’re expected to clap like seals? This is not the norm if you look at film history, there has always been a balance of self-made actors alongside those that were well connected. Now, particularly in Britain it has become an exclusively elitist environment just like our Art and most of our sport. I don’t think we should accept it so blindly.",dt0v6z
f8tr917,"That's exactly what I thought the twist would be, a he seems perfect, but... Twist. Just didn't expect the but to be he's dead lol",dt0v6z
f8te2gc,"I am strongly in ghost/spirit camp, if it were mere hallucination she wouldn't have known where he lived or that his phone was in the cupboard.",dt0v6z
f6y99hh,or unstable minds think alike,dt0v6z
f8vkhsd,"It's a Paul Feig film, so I expected some form of political agenda in it. It's a shame he even had to get the date wrong to keep the agenda while keeping the main character the age he wanted her at.",dt0v6z
f6xk7aw,"Thanks, the OP’s response really confused me because the character wasn’t sweet at all even though Emilia was/is adorable.",dt0v6z
f8te8di,"I'm leaning towards that too, especially with the apartment thing. Even if he didn't interact with the world in front of us the audience, I'm sure he did a couple things to open some doors like ghosts do",dt0v6z
f8teeuv,"Yup, Also its not necessarily something that would accompany it, but she didn't do anything besides see him that would suggest she was crazy or anything to hallucinate so strongly.",dt0v6z
