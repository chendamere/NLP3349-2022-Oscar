e4bxjrk,"It was not good.

The opening scene with the raid on the russian safehouse was a strong start, but that, unfortunately, seemed to be the movie's peak. I'm not honestly sure what I was expecting from a Mark Wahlberg-starring action movie, but I was drawn in by Iko Uwais' name having seen The Raid 1 and 2. Iko's bone crunching physicality, however, was disgracefully butchered by an over indulgence in rapid cuts and shaky camera. The action doesn't get better with the gun fights either, they all boil down to c*ut to gun, cut to bullet hole, cut to other guy's gun, cut to another bullet hole, repeat*.

The action portion of this action movie was disappointing. What about the rest? Well, Marky Mark plays the character of Marky Mark with a gun, I guess? It's up to you whether or not you're into that. Overall, there were no blatant cases of terrible acting, but nothing was good. I can't even remember any of their names. The premise and plot were fairly basic and hard to mess up with a good ol' ""gotcha"" twist in the end, so the story was far from the worst aspect. With nothing else to elevate the story, whether it be good acting or good action, the movie doesn't stand out in anyway. You can tell at moments that the movie really tried to make some cryptic and dark comments on government affairs, but the closest it got was a couple presidential bobbleheads. The usual /r/im14andthisisdeep stuff.

It all boils down to bad action, bland acting, and a boringly unoriginal Hollywood script.

No reason for the plot point about Wahlberg being super smart.

Why leave Annie's fate so ambiguous? If there's a sequel they'll show that she actually killed the other guy and was alive? ""Do you want to talk about what happened to Annie?"" I don't care what happened to her.

e4bwrio,"what a clusterfuck of a movie. This is just one of those ""where to even begin?"" with problems.

* Firstly, I don't remember hating a main character as much as I hated Mark Wahlberg in this movie. I get being an asshole was 'his thing' but this was just another level. Shitty backstory made for a real shitty character with absolutely zero redeeming characteristics. His monologues were hilariously bad. He just shits on everyone in his team at every opportunity. His 'tick' was more an annoyance than anything.
* The baddies would risk World War 3 over some personal vendetta? What?
* Peter Berg's cameo was so unnecessary and laughable.
* Wahlberg & Cohan do not make for a good duo at all. Also, they go around breaking shit and leaving? What was up with that lol? 
* How many grenades could they possibly have? I swear they used like 30 of them during this movie. They were just getting thrown left and right.
* Ronday Rousey is such a terrible actress. They didn't kill her off fast enough. Also, ""fucking nerds!"", is on track to be the single-worst line in movies this year. There's really no competition.
* ""Let's explode 2 grenades 5 feet away from us and hide behind this mattress. We'll be alright.""
* The 'laughs' all felt cheap and undeserved.
* Iwo Kuwais was inches/seconds away from dying every few minutes but this entire movie/plot/attack/etc depended on him surviving until the very end. That was really shitty planning.
* The bad guys were just idiot bullet-fodders the whole movie. The body count was stupidly-high. Who cares about action scenes if they're so goddamn unrealistic?
* The Overwatch team in general was an incompetent, bumbling group of idiots. I can't imagine/believe that 
 hundreds of thousands of peoples' lives would depend on them.
* That entire first mission was probably the single worst special forces mission of all time. It was such a simple thing that they had locked down. Then one of their agents dies and it's just like 'eh, whatever, just another Tuesday. Like what? That was a disaster.
* This is Berg's Mission Impossible-lite with no heart or brains. It's sequel-bait trash. Also, really bad sequel bait. 
* Lauren Cohan's entire family/divorce thing was dumb. The part when she screams out 'Family Talks' or whatever during a top-secret mission briefing was mind-blowingly bad screenwriting.
* Complete waste of Iko Uwais. Could Peter Berg squeeze more cuts into his fights scenes?
* I can't handle John Malkovich with hair.
* So much more but I've wasted enough time with this movie. That was a long ass 90 minutes.

That ending lol. ""The entire team is dead except for the shittiest, most irritating character, please give us another $12 next year"" is not a good way to sell a sequel.

The rest is cut fast but for maximum impact and it keeps the high intensity up. Berg's best talent is shootouts and the guns are deafening. The movie pretty much never stops and at 90 mins it was perfect length. Geuinely didn't see the plot twist coming. I hope they get to make a sequel.

also Ronda Rousey was a pleasant surprise as her previous acting roles have been pure cringe. Obviously she wasn't great here but she was at least believable and didn't make me cringe with her line delivery like in her previous movies.

e4drj3x,"I liked this more than some of the other responses here, but it's not great.  Why cast Iko Uwais in your movie if you're just going to have shitty fight scenes?

What I liked: I think the use of Mark Wahlberg as a total asshole all the time is pretty much the best possible use of him. I liked that the movie had some guts with respect to killing off characters. I think the concepts for most of the action scenes were pretty good, and a better action director could have gotten some great stuff out of the exact same scenes. Imagine this movie directed by Leitch and Stahelski. As it was the action led to some brutal moments (Iko killing the one guy by dragging his throat on the broken car window) which were pretty cool.

What I didn't like: Again, the action scenes are shot really poorly. I personally thought we had progressed past this, even Peter Berg has done better than this, but the shaky-cam and over-editing was noticeable. I thought this movie did a weird thing I've noticed in a couple other movies recently where the line reading they chose for the trailer is different than the one in the finished film, and the one they chose for the film is worse. I'm thinking specifically Wahlberg's ""You're chaos, but I think I might be worse"" line. I wish the team members other than Wahlberg and Cohan had more character. Like it's cool that they killed off most of the team, but did I really care about Ronda Rousey's character? Finally I thought the total lack of resolution on what happened on the plane was a weird choice.

Overall I think this wasn't very good, but at the same time I did enjoy parts of it, and if it's successful enough to get the sequel they're clearly hoping for, I would probably go see it (and be excited for it).  I'd give this a 2/5.",97yb41

Oddly enough I did like Mark Wahlberg's character and It might be because I'm not jaded to his type of acting. Maybe it's because I haven't seen many if any Wahlberg films. I liked his assholeishness, I could've done without his rubber band quirk thing. Everyone else felt bland and pretty much pointless.

ed7707j,"I'm late to the party but I just watched the first 45 minutes of this on a plane and I have to vent.

- Opening action scene: They capture 5 bad guys in the house, take their pictures and **do dental impressions** to ID them, but they don't bother to restrain them?  Nobody had some zip ties?

- What the fuck was with all the fucking cursing?  

- Is Mark Wahlberg's character supposed to be on the Autism spectrum or something?  Or just a sociopath?  

- The subplot with the female character video-chatting with her ex-husband--played by Peter Berg giving himself a distracting cameo--over an app that removes all the curse-words was one of the strangest, most out-of-place things I've ever seen in an action movie.

- The running time is only 1 hour and 34 minutes.  I made it as far as the first Iko Uwais fight scene, which was about 40-45 minutes into the movie, and they hadn't even gotten to the ""we have to transport this guy 22 miles"" setup.

Granted the US may still have to grant the guy's wish because of those chemicals but at least there wont be any bloodshed along the way.

2. Where were the guards at the hideout for overwatch? We clearly saw some opening doors etc. I would think a sophisticated place would have some sort of security measures. At least show us how those securities were bypassed.

e4hh6bs,"I thought the movie was enjoyable until the ending twist. Now I'm not sure what to think about it. Its an obvious attempt to set up a sequel, but it also doesn't feel like it was a story that really needing one. 

I feel like, in a regular movie, that the twist of Li actually being a Russian sleeper agent would have been the end of the second act. Saving act three to be Mark Wahlberg-v-Iko Uwais. 

Instead they saved it for the final minutes of the movie and end it with Silva beginning to go on the hunt for Li. They leave it unanswered as to whether Alice is alive or not.

The action scenes were pretty intense. I was really surprised that they wiped out so many of the Overwatch team. Rousey got killed almost immediately when the fighting started. The editing was a little too crazy when they were fighting in the apartment building. Sometimes you couldn't tell what was happening.

I'd give the movie a 7/10. It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't as good as the other 3 Mark Wahlberg-Peter Berg films. If they make a sequel that's about Marky Mark and the guy from The Raid trying to kill each other, then I'll probably go see it.",97yb41
e8ct06w,"If I only had read the reviews before watching...

The writing on this movie is terrible, here is why:

* redundant boring monologues from the lead actor, just shittalking all the time...
* Annoying oneliners and way too many of them
*  People die left and right. The editing seems like we should care about them when they die, but the character aren't developed at all in the story.
* without spoiling it, the plot 'twist' was so obvious.  >!not about the kid but the triple agent and the involvment of the russians part !<
* Oh and what about that habit of Silva snapping the rubber, we get a small indication why he does it but it accomplishes nothing to his persona in the movie. i kept rolling my eyes every time he did it.

Then we have the editing... I think a lot of people already mentioned this here, the fast cuts are ridiculous. Something i haven't seen anybody mention yet is the duplication of the radio contact sounds. It goes like this: 

fieldoperative view(FOV):FO says""enemy is attacking us from x"" Headquarters view(HQV): HQ hears ""enemy is attacking us from xyz"" HQ says ""go to y for extraction"" FOV: HQ says ""go to y for extraction"" FO responds ""OK"" HQV: HQ hears ""OK""

This might be the most prime example in recent memory of a script which is completely broken. Nothing could save this, not the production value, the acting or even the directing.

The storylines were overstuffed and inconsequential.

That was fresh and cool for the first Bourne, but it’s been so overdone now. In a movie packed to the gills with quick cuts, there were a few unnecessary ones that hung around uncomfortably long. 

Mark Wahlberg’s character is an asshole but I didn’t exactly hate it. Ronda Rousey was meh until “fucking nerds”. Maggie’s family background was the biggest waste of screen time ever, it literally made no impact on my feelings for her character throughout. Iko Uwais was awesome and I feel like we could’ve shaved from elsewhere to give him at least 1 more ass-kicking scene. John Malkovich deserved a better script and hairpiece.

&#x200B;

The Achilles heal of this movie is definitely the ending. What the fuck... The twist literally comes out of nowhere for no reason. Had they just escaped on the plane at the end, it would have ended up being a decent action film to me. Why did they feel the need to throw in that twist? It didn't tie anything together. It also made Iko Uwais's character much less likable, limiting the rewatchability. Lauren Cohen's send off was atrocious. Theres no real explanation and it really just wasn't necessary at all. Did they run out of money at the end of the film and setting for that garbage?

Anyway, it could have been better, but it was enjoyable for what it is: **an entertaining mindless action movie**. I didn't get in for the plot; all I wanted to see was Wahlberg, Cohan and Rousey shoot some bad guys, which they did accompanied by Iko's incredible athleticism (seriously... **wow**). Although I admit the end was a terribly delivered plot twist. I mean, I'm fine with the *triple agent* twist, but it was delivered so confusingly that I didn't understand what exactly happened other than ""cool guy is bad guy"". The rest of the movie was fine... or at least for people who got in expecting what it delivered.

e4g7811,"it doesnt deserve the ultra low RT score.  It is an okay movie with a fair amount of flaws but was short enough to not become frustrating.  And I did like the ending twist, despite it being sorta contrived.  

Ill list a couple flaws to perhaps outline why the movie may or may not be something you may enjoy.  

In the opening scene we see our group who incredibly efficient and skilled spy's/delta force folks infiltrate a house using incredibly cut of the edge technology, quickly subduing a house full of russian spies.  But, while holding the russians at gun point, not once are their hands ever zip tied, something average military troops do.  So we know what is going to happen.  

The opening credits show sequences of real life terror attacks montaged with news reports.  It is an odd way to open, what is otherwise, a kung fu action movie.  

Iko Uwais was very entertaining, but Berg's film style did not work well to show off how talented Iko is.  All the fist fighting was edited to make it pretty difficult to be too impressed by the choreography.  It seemed like Berg wanted to make a straight forward action movie after making real life tragic films.  I Don't blame him, it's pretty stressful and emotionally draining directing a film like Patriots day.

There is a sequence toward the end of the 2nd act in which are protagonists spend, what felt like, 20 minutes in apartment hallways while fending off waves off attackers.  Too me, this was the worst part of the film.  It felt like I was watching the same thing happen again and again, the apartment was a boring design and I had a hard time keeping track of where each character was in relation to each other (because all the hallways looked the same, plus Berg editing).  Oh, also the fact that it made me think of the Raid, which did essentially the same thing in a much more imaginative way, did it no favors.  

Whalberg was directed poorly and it made him not seem believable as his character.  Which is that of a no bullshit, intimidating quasi genius delta force operator who is constantly yelling at people.  Whalberg is a by and large good actor, and I know he has a good relationship with Berg, but him constantly yelling at people for being stupid or fucking up at work just didn't fit work.  It isnt intimidating if a character is just constantly yelling at people.  He maybe should've been directed to be more like his character from The Departed.  Sarcastic, dismissive and then only yelling and showing anger when the occasion deemed it. 

So those are some flaws off the top of my head after watching the film earlier today. 

On the plus side, it did have a fun sequence.  I enjoyed the concept of ""overwatch"" being this supremely state of the art tech shadow group, the film just didnt really do much to convince me the characters were actually competent enough to actually be in such a group.  (i mean, they kept losing their feeds and no one was trying to do anything about it beyond asking why they kept happening). 

Ronda Rousay has taken acting lessons and can now emote, she won't ever win an oscar but she isn't a distracting wooden actress like she was in Fast 6.  

John Malkovich was fun to watch.  Id like to see him in more movies like this, he was a good fit as the somewhat corporately detached mentality of a leader of a group such as Overwatch.  

I wouldn't consider this a movie worth paying to watch in theaters, unless you wanna kill a couple hours at the theater on a hot day (like i did).  But when it comes out on HBO in 9 months id definitely recommend DVRing it, it is a solid average film.

e4iu4sf,"I usually like Berg movies. (Hell I liked Battleship)

This felt like a mess.

Too many jump cuts in moments where it wasn't needed was the first thing that popped up to my mind. There were a lot of normal conversations that had like 20 jump cuts, and it felt nauseating and difficult to follow what was being said (because it was focusing on a special tick that Wahlberg's character was doing, and trying to relate it to the special tick that the Uwais's character was doing [and spoiler, one was doing it as a calming mechanism, the other was to remember his training, at least that's how I interpreted it](#spoiler)).

Action scenes were still well done. 

You could guess accurately what was happening in the movie. So it felt more foreboding to me than a surprise [at least Overwatch HQ being attacked and destroyed, not Uwai being a bad guy](#spoiler) 

The ""main"" antagonist, Asian cop of asian special forces, did a pretty good job in making me not like him much. Uwai had a good performance [and mainly his performance in Raid made me want him to be a good guy and so him being the bad guy was a decent twist. All of it culminating with the Russian guy doing the same thing that Uwai does with his fingers surprised the shit out of me.](#spoiler)

Otherwise, Wahlberg felt like he was playing the same character in all of his movies, an asshole who has a heart in the end. Cohan did a good job, but her divorce/family sub-plot felt pretty out of place. 

I'd say it's a movie to watch if you have A List or if it's somehow on MoviePass. Otherwise wait until it's out to rent/stream if you really want to watch an action film.

eb6zps1,"Okay.. I know this movie wasn't well liked,  and maybe I'm reading too much into things, but I think there was a lot more to it than what was on the surface.

For starters, Mark's character is said to be a genius,  who lost his family early, and has signs of mental illness. The ART found in the bogus cargo container was pointed out by James Silva to be by Edvard Munch. From Wikipedia: His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Sounds like Silva...
The obvious similarity between Silva's popping of the rubber band,  and Li Noor could imply they were working together on their own mission to take out the entire network of this team. The editing intentionally focuses on this before a character has to manipulate others. i.e. insisting Alice take her family calls when she says no was to get her off her game and distract her... insisting on taking the ""walk in"" was to give the cell number of the French ambassador and distract the director with other matters.. 
Silva could also have orchestrated the attack on Li. He was one of few people who would know this would trigger the activation of his team. 
When he interviews Li they ask each other coyly if the other is a ""witch"". I got this from Google: If you’ve read John le Carré’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, then you’ll recall that “Project Witchcraft,” the infamous operation that guides the plot of the novel, is in fact a beautifully orchestrated KGB dangle, using a Soviet cultural attaché who connives with a British double agent to defraud “the Circus,” or MI6, which thinks Alexei Polyakov is actually its man.
When Silva leaves the cafe, he conveniently distracting everyone from the pending attack.
 Each attack picking off the team, while buying time for the Russians to zero in on offsite teams. 
Whalberg's character and performance appear over the top and grating, but his character could have been using it as a tool to distract others and drive his plan.
The most puzzling ending... the line about saying hi to mother was an obvious reference to the other teams. Silva,  this supposed genius, shouldn't have been able to let it go. It seemed a nod to a co-conspirator of mission success and the impending attack on the tech teams.
FINALLY why else would Silva not get on the plane too? And why would the Russians have been content to leave a single team member, specifically the actual shooter, considering all their efforts. 

Admittedly, no matter if I'm right or wrong,  the story was sloppily told. It was heavy on choppy action scenes and short on character development and lacked focus and explanation of the overriding plot. It seemed to me that there was much more going on than what was on the surface. ",97yb41

My main gripe was also how half-assed the story was.  Literally nothing gets resolved; Alice's storyline with her family has no resolution and is left with some ambiguous ending, and the twist at the end isn't really a resolution so much as it is a setup for unneeded sequels.  Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of James Silva was him just being an asshole the whole time, and he has no development whatsoever throughout the film.  All of these different story arcs were covered but never finished, so what's the point?  This movie was an action-thriller cash grab that is trying to ham-fist a franchise to audiences with a low-quality film.

If it wasn't for /u/Ghost-Mech's comment linking to Berg's instagram to where the editor and director are arguing over the cuts, I would've thought this was just a film destroyed by the editor. BUT NO IT WAS PETER BERG GETTING AS FRENETIC AS MICHAEL BAY! I don’t know if some Freaky Friday shit happened to Peter Berg because “Mile 22” embodies all of the trappings of a Bay film, but somehow maintains Berg’s style.  
For starters, let’s talk about the movie’s editing. One of the major aspects I cannot stand about “Mile 22” is the editing, for the shot composition is terrible. The film is composed of nothing but fast cuts that are filmed from various angles (if not every shot imaginable) but no shot lasts five seconds. I tried counting and each shot is disrupted by a quick cut. No shot has any room to breathe which makes it incredibly exhausting to follow the film. It makes you question if any scene had a master shot, which is the first shot a filmmaker must shoot when starting a scene before he gets to the coverage shots. This movie is comprised of nothing but coverage shots.

Barely any scene carefully plays out because they’re constantly cutting back and forth between the three different locations the film takes place at and often times it would be mid-sentence. The way this movie is spliced together feels less like a movie and more like the longest commercial for the CIA ever created. This has the same flow as “Speed Racer”... not the Wachowski sisters’ movie, but the show from the 60s where characters talk so fast that a constant cut occurs at the end of each sentence. Now I'm just thinking that because of Colby and Berg's disputes the film took a massive toll because of it.

But even then, the performances by everyone who is not Iko Uwais are terrible. When it comes to Mark Wahlberg, what he’s known for best is his knack of talking so fast that when he does, it’s usually often humorous. It’s not in this. The stuff he says is just stupid. What makes it worse is that his character is autistic. Not as a joke, but Jimmy has some violent tendencies and a rubber band around his wrist that he keeps slapping his hand with in nearly every scene that you can make a shot a game out of it. You know that he’s autistic and you question, “WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HIRE HIM TO DO THIS COVERT OPERATION MISSION?!” He is clearly mentally unstable. It can’t be because of his skills because they’re not all that great. Honestly, others can do it better.

e4caj6g,"**The bad:**

1) Too many fast cuts, just unnecessary.

2)  Pacing: the movie stalled a little in the middle (partially because of 3.) They needed to transition from the Russian safehouse to the medical room and then to the escape quicker.

3) The fact that they are trying to set this up as a franchise.  Too much exposition. I didn't care that Wahlberg is super smart... didn't seem relevant to the story (and its something that they could have shown, not told, the audience.)  It was also obvious that there was some apocalypse fuel that will get released if they don't meet their goal... they didn't need to spend so long explaining it.  Would have been better to structure this movie as a one-off, then retcon later as necessary.

4) The apocalypse fuel should have been a biological weapon.  That way some of the dumb dialogue could have been less dumb.

5) Only a few of the quips worked.  The script was shit.  Malkovich deserves much better.

6) Their team got way too small, way too quickly (which isn't to say I didn't like that they were willing to kill some of the team, its just... they got rid of almost all of them almost immediately, which means that the rest of them had plot armor.)

**The Good:**

1) Just an incredible variety of injuries and manners of death.  Plenty of hand-to-hand combat, including sharp objects going into necks and heads.  Probably upwards of 20 deaths or mutilations by gunfire (and a LOT of indoor shooting which looked great,) and honestly some of the best small explosion work in recent cinematic history.  Did they have a lot of grenades?  Yeah... but they all served some tactical/plot purpose.

2) Talking about those grenades, while I'm sure this won't win sound editing awards ala Master and Commander, they didn't scrimp on the sounds of battle.  Given the perspective was close in pretty much throughout the movie, you were pretty much enveloped in sound throughout with plenty of thump (worthwhile in Dolby theaters.)

3)  When the pacing was good, it was excellent.  The dilemma about saving the remaining team member versus getting on with the mission was well done, and added tension.  

4) They were willing to kill ""heroes,"" and added a couple of last stand moments that were very good.

5) This film didn't preach, play identity politics or rely on sentimentality.  It was basically get person X from point A to point B in the allotted time (including a curve ball or two,) and murder everyone that tries to stop you.  We need more of these movies, that don't complicate things with a big moral message.

6) While, as I mentioned above, the script was shit, there was very minimal dialogue (other than exposition.) They avoided having Ronda Rousey or Iko Uwais speak, and Mark Wahlberg and John Malkovich were plenty likable (because they were goal focused.)  They both played their characters according to their presented goals and traits.",97yb41

Those were well-received, so it's not like a Chinese-Hollywood co-production automatically means there's a bad movie coming. Hollywood was pumping out so much crap long before this China money came flooding in, so I haven't noticed much of an overall quality difference between then and now. This movie may partially qualify as an Eastern production, but it's very much a typical Peter Berg movie, so I'd primarily put the blame for the film's problems on him, the writing, and other technical aspects.

e4h27lw,"The entire setup (for both sides) was to get Li Noor to ""safety"" where he'd willingly give up the code to keep the fake disk from self-destructing. The overwatch crew inputting the code revealed their own location to the hit squad that got them all in the end, and that squad was pretty close to their physical location already. 

If the bad guys popped Wahlberg's crew early, Noor wouldn't be able to give the code to anyone-- he needed someone to hear it and relay it to ""Mother"". If Noor gave the code too early, ""Mother"" would have realized sooner that Noor was a triple agent, and the crew would have bailed before they got got. 

So basically the bad guys let Wahlberg's crew escape because they'd all die anyway. They were buying their own guys more time, plus at that point only two people were protecting Li, then one person.

1. The russians mentioning their mission is failure ""if he dies"". He meaning the traitor.
2. The cyber girl mentioning the encryption is done by a ""women"". We dont know if the russian female commander is skilled at that so it might not be a direct hint.
3. the tapping - i guess since they scanned him he is not ""transmitting"" via morse or a new code. Or maybe he has some new stealth tech that bypasses it?

I dont think any of the ""hints"" are blatantly obvious as any of those can be countered by something else. The most obvious is the Russians hacking into the system at the convenient time. BUT even so you can argue the foreign country's ""cop"" is in on with them OR the traitor but there's no definitive answer.
Also, they showed the guy's supposed family or maybe just cover and that puts a wrench in it too.

EDIT:  Also, I don’t completely buy that they were refugees.  They’ve rigged the house to destroy evidence, and the only thing in the movie I can recall saying that they were was the same news footage that contains the lies about who killed them; clearly suspect information in general, and it doesn’t matter in the least to the movie’s awful plot if they were or weren’t.

I'm saying the antagonists aren't the villains because the ""heroes"" shouldn't have shot those people in the opening act in the first place, bad intelligence or not. They didn't get an accurate count of people in the house, didn't restrain any of the ""spies""/""terrorists"" they detained so that those supposed ""spies""/""terrorists"" couldn't use their hands, didn't check for any weapons, allowed that shit to go pear-shaped and figured the solution was to shoot every single person there. The ""heroes"" were hilariously incompetent.

e4h1bge,"Oh yea, I forgot about peak pricing as well. It went to shit fairly quickly. Honestly if I didn’t have AMC I’d just hit up 5 dollar Tuesday every week again. Stubbs is 20 plus tax but if there’s multiple theatres so you have a ton of options it’s great. But I go with my wife so it’s always something to do since we’re both cinephiles.",97yb41

e4e5lr2,"Yeah they did, but not in a good way. Let's make an action film...only tear the scenes apart in editing so it's not clear for anyone to see. Let's cast and market actual talent but kill them off and under use them for the entire scene. I'm all for subversion with a point but like I said before, it felt mean spirited. ",97yb41

e4lyer6,I really liked his English acting though. He was the most believable part of the whole movie. Totally ruined his fight scenes with the shaky cam and editing though.,97yb41

e4lp4y6,"> But we gotta go back for Lauren? Well, okay.

It did make sense because as far as [Mark and Iko knew she wasn't harmed in anyway.  The others were visibly hurt to the point they would just slow them down.](#spoiler)",97yb41

Honestly, I didn't want to say it outright, I didn't get chosen for this particular job with Berg in the end. I meant to say that after I got rejected I heard some negative things about working with him.

I've taken some jobs that I didn't like but I know that's the game. Gotta do whatever it takes to move up the ladder.

e4rhasc,"Oh, alright. 

The way I understand this is that even if the chip was at the Embassy, the chip was just a ruse to give the Overwatch team a reason to crack a code that would reveal their location (but they didn't know that part). 

Wahlberg's crew and at least some part of the Overwatch team (the ""fucking nerds"") were all in the same physical location at the beginning of the movie, at the Embassy in ""Indocarr""/Indonesia, but it'd be messy for the Russians if Li gave the crew the code right there, they unlocked it, and suddenly there's a hit squad at the Embassy. 

The whole op was a set-up by the Russians to take advantage of how the U.S. runs their ops, with turning their people into ""ghosts"" and disavowing them if shit goes wrong. They're on a mission and out of U.S. protection until it's done. The 8-hour time limit forces Overwatch to act as quickly as possible to complete their mission at the cost of not having much time to pick an actually safe location to operate at.

So they set up in the same country but at an undisclosed location (to save time). Li needs to be transported (to keep Wahlberg's people away from OW and leave Mother unprotected). The comms get hacked and random cops and hitmen show up from seemingly nowhere, picking off each Child one by one (so Li has next-to-no opposition to kill him when they figure out he's a triple agent). It worked out well for him, he was next to Alice who already got her ass kicked a bunch not that long ago. And he's still alive and she's either dead or a hostage.

So the Russians' revenge plot worked. If OW had more time they would've questioned basic stuff like how that one cop knew where they were hiding, or switched their comms again, or pressed for more information about Li's ""family"" that was supposedly killed by corrupt government; he doesn't give names or dates. Or theyd have wondered why a bunch of cops thought Li giving out ""government secrets"" was more important to them than what he knew about the cesium which would've caused the biggest shitstorm and world war 3 if it went off.

In comparison, letting a dying dude set up his guns and pop off a couple of paid hitmen wasn't nearly that bad.",97yb41
e4gqvbn,Had no clue about The Dark Knight. I suppose I've only noticed it recently because I have seen far more films this year than any other.,97yb41

e4c06m0,In the ring. On the mic shes trash ,97yb41
e4mgmze,"They already had a sequel planned and probably greenlit, but we'll see how that plays out depending on how it did in the box office. I don't think it's made its budget yet",97yb41
e4dyl6q,"Just did. It was fine. Nothing memorable, but with A-List and $5 each towards concessions, it was a cheap night out. ",97yb41
e4kr3fw,"Evans has expressed uncertainty over it in the last year or two. I guess he spent so much time doing the first two that he wanted to branch out and tackle other projects. My hope is that he's been formulating action ideas for the third one all these years, and in a year or two he'll be more optimistic about closing out the trilogy. If anything, at least we have 'The Apostle' hitting Netflix in October.",97yb41

Edit: fixed a word",97yb41
e4xpgo3,"The issue is that Overwatch has no reason not to be in a secure building in the US.

Also, you can't disavow a team that clearly left the embassy to move a defector. Impossible Mission Force works because Hunt and Benji aren't walking around embassies and other diplomatic posts waiting for a job. ",97yb41
e4s3kkz,"Yeah true, I think Alice is going to be alive but a hostage.  They hyped her up with some background information that would be otherwise useless unless a second movie is coming out (which they said its going to be more than one.)

Also, they are probably going to use Taken(the movie) aspects for her and try to make a movie series based on that, then the 3rd will probably be some big job and be their last.  ",97yb41
e4gsuvv,"Yep, the CEO is from Hong Kong, Bruce travels to China and all the shots of Batman from that sequence are all in IMAX so it’s featured prominently. I’m sure the China film industry funds Nolan’s studio, Syncopy since there’s parts of Inception in China and I think the Chinese govt is mentioned in Interstellar",97yb41

e4zivjd,"It's the premise of the movie, what more do you want to nitpick about? You're not even the person that made the original point. They're a shadow group that's meant to operate with 0 traceable connections to the U.S. in case things go wrong. The Russians exploited that to kill a majority of them off because of their initial cover-up of the incident that opened the movie (they blamed murdered Russian refugees on other Russian organizations).

The fuck's the point of mentioning Mission Impossible here when that series has had entire movies built on framing the IMF, targeting members of the IMF including Ethan, etc? They're not any more plausibly shadowy than whatever was going on with Overwatch on that alone.",97yb41
e4vhiar,"Yeah and the part in Dunkirk where the Chinese soldiers are in the ship cafeteria before it gets torpedoed, and there's a whole scene of them waving to the main character's group.",97yb41

e4cz9kr,Link? Last I heard he was still down for 3 but wanted to take a hiatus from it.,97yb41
e4xp70a,"Chinese troops at Dunkirk? No way. They *might* be Indian/Nepalese but there weren't any Chinese soldiers in Europe. 

China wasn't really a country in the 1940s and was busy slowly loosing to Japan.",97yb41
