Quick Question:

dv3p5z4,"Saw the movie this afternoon and it took me a few hours to decide how I really feel about it. Overall I had a pretty good time, I’m always game for a slow paced spy movie. While there are certainly issues with the script and some of the brutality, I feel like a lot of the hate is underserved. It had some really tight sequences of suspense, particularly the scene on the runway. While it isn’t the easiest movie to watch, I was really engrossed by the story and Jennifer Lawrence’s performance, accent aside. If you’re willing to look past some of its faults, this is a pretty worthy successor to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. ",81bwds

dv2aj23,"***Why*** would you have sex with this woman, Nate Nash? She is a walking pile of red flags on top of a flashing neon sign reading I AM A HONEY TRAP.

Given that JLaw's whole schtick was being able to read people and the academy pushed sex as a manipulative tool so much, I actually would have found it a neat twist for her to say ""this guy doesn't want sex. He's shown himself to get overly emotionally involved in protecting his source, but not in a sexual way. He just wants a vulnerable source and he's the only guy who can contact them and he's the only guy who can protect them. It's a power thing and a protective thing, but not in a sexual way, he's just out to prove that he's a great agent. So I won't fuck him, I'll just keep making myself look vulnerable and battered by the Russians, and that'll be enough to lure him in.""

dvop9ik,"I know I will be in the minority when I saw this...but I really, really genuinely enjoyed this film. Firstly, not only did I *not* think it was too long, I in fact thought the pacing of the film was great. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard was riveting, with the track ""Didn't I Do Well?"" being a bop. I found that Jennifer Lawrence did a good job (I don't think I have the linguistic authority to judge an actor's Russian accent), and I actually believed the violence and sexual content to be grounded and not at all egregious. 

Conversely, I will agree with the critics that it was tricky to find chemistry between JLaw and Joel Edgerton. Despite this, I had an extremely fun time viewing this film, and all of its twists. Daresay...I may see it again with a friend?...I have MoviePass so it wouldn't be any extra financial burden.

Anyway, *Red Sparrow* was a really enjoyable film that I found to be well-made, and upon which people are hating for the sake of doing so.",81bwds
dvchcig,"I know this was a big part of the book, but the movie didn't need to have that entire Sparrow/Sex School act that took close to half an hour.

It was wildly incongruent with the rest of the movie, as Dominika doesn't use seduction or sex in her actual spy activities - instead just using standard spycraft. To the average moviegoer who has not read the book, the Sparrow School plot would seem like ridiculous editing and directorial mistake.

Removing this would also make the pacing much better.",81bwds

Also, I've heard some criticisms of Jennifer Lawrence's accent - but to me Charlotte Rampling's was much more egregious.

For what it is, it's great. Visually, it's amazing. Some people are calling the sex scenes superfluous and also saying it's too gory. I don't see that. There is sex and gore, but it's not too overwhelming that it distracts from the actual story.",81bwds
e064kni,"I'm not sure why so many people hate on this movie. The accents may have been lacking, and maybe it was a bit predictable due to the entire 'american movie involving a usa-vs-russia plot', but what movies of its kind aren't?

I checked some reviews, and apparently some people went into this expecting some sort of Fast&Furious style action bullshit? Really? Wow.

I loved the suspense. I loved the interaction. The beauty of this one was in the subtlety. Anyone can guess sort of how it will end (again, usa-vs-russia in an american movie ...), so it is the route to get there that matters.. and it was suspenseful every bit of the way.

It is one of few movies I consider excellent. There wasn't too much nudity. There wasn't too little. Same with blood, gore and death. Every single instance of blood & sex emphasized exactly how large the stakes were. Any single instance of these in this movie is worth more than a hundred deaths or romance scenes in many other movies.

It was a wonderful, albeit somewhat predictable journey.",81bwds
dv250rl,Was I the only one that found the torture and rape seems a bit gratuitous? For the most part they didnt add to the story and just prolonged a movie that was already considerably lengthy. ,81bwds
dv647rp,"I don't think this movie will be received well by people who didn't read the novel. I mean, I'm not trying to be elitist or anything, but the articles I saw mentioning it leading up to release seem to think it's a very different thing than I would expect having read the novel. When I saw people calling it ""Black Widow"" I knew they were expecting something the novel never really promised, and after finally watching it I got about what I expected. 

Overall the movie paid off on the general feel of what the novel was going for pretty well-- it was a Le Carrean spy thriller built around a subversive ""Bond Girl."" It actually did things a little better by merging Marta and ""Swan,"" (Swan was admittedly a small part of both the novel and movie, yet Mary Louise-Parker still felt the most synonymous with her book counterpart to me) and having Dominika set up Vanya as the mole instead of actually giving up Marble. Of course, doing it that way kind of creates an impossible divergence from the source material if they're going to follow up with the rest of Matthews books. 

Anyone expecting another *Salt* or *Atomic Blonde*, will walk out disappointed, but if you're prepared for something more methodical I'd say it's a 7/10. ",81bwds

dv24ngz,"It was such an unbelievable spy movie. Lets take a somewhat famous ballerina for the Bolshoi Ballet (that gets recognized in public and could be easily Googleable), whose Uncle is number 2 at the KGB. Lets send her to a spy school one that lasts for years and only has former military recruits and let her finish after only 3 months. During those 3 months she doesn't follow instructions and beats one of her fellow students.

Lets then send her to the field unprepared and barely supervised in a foreign country, where her boss fucks the interns and her roommate is a fellow spy who can't even bother hiding documents or securing them in a safe.

Then she immediately switches sides after a few conversations. Every time she is  with the American spy they are either in public where people can see or in an apartment with all the windows open.

This American spy has a high placed contact in the Russian government, but at no time is he protected and the Russians can kidnap him at any time. They only think to tie up and torture him after he sleeps with Jenifer Lawrence. Multiple times they both could be watched and yet they never sneak around. 

During a meeting with an American selling secrets, they meet again in a public bar in a major hotel. The spy boss from Belarus even shows up, so we know the Russians know and at no point does anyone think to call off the meet or close the ""fucking"" windows.

Somehow through luck and outright BS, Jennifer Lawrence frames her uncle, protects the mole and manages to both be a spy, protect her mom and become a hero of Russia. All with little help from the mole and with less than 3 months training.

The craziest thing about this movie is that it was written by a CIA operative, yet it has less spy craft and intelligence than a Roger Moore Bond Movie. And never mind Jennifer Lawrence's half assed Boris and Natasha accent.


Skip this film and watch The Americans on FX. That has real spy craft, people actually speaking Russian and is both smart and realistic. It also has similar levels or nudity and violence.",81bwds

dxrs61y,"I really liked the film. A solid 8/10. I would say it is Jennifer Lawrence's best movie since Days of Future Past. It was good to see a grounded spy movie for once that actually focuses on the spy-ish aspect rather than the over the top action we find in most spy movies.

The best part was the story. Unpredictable, suspenseful and was developed well. I also liked how Dominca transitioned into a spy. I think Lawrence and Egerton were terrific. J Law did a nice job with the accent. But the supporting cast of British actors were terrible even though i like many of them. The actor playing Ivan the uncle was also in good form. 

Production design was excellent. The costumes and sets gave this movie and elegant feel. James Howard's score is another plus and goes really well with the tone of the film.

Overall, I felt it was a pleasant surprise and it is disappointing to see it get poor response from the critics and the audience. The movie cost 70m and has made 145m, so double its budget. Despite the bad reviews and word of mouth its impressive that it made that much. Seems like J Law still is a solid draw.",81bwds

dv2881n,"I liked Jennifer Lawrence's performance & the movie overall, but it has a lot of flaws. It bugs me that almost every character does something really stupid:

* Dominika: why didn't she keep assaulting Simyonov in the final encounter, instead of freeing Nate as the deadly assassin recovered?
* Nate: why does he think that keeping a routine of swimming & other repeated behaviours every day would lure out the mole?
* Korchnoi: why did he keep advising the termination of Dominika if he wanted to eventually recruit her?
* Egorov: why does he keep popping up in plain sight at cities with active espionage plans underway?
* Matron: why does she teach only seduction/rejection of sexual limits but no other skills useful for a spy (i.e. combat, surveillance)
* Marta: why are her critically sensitive notes in plain text & poorly hidden?

The generic agents are also blindingly stupid, especially when the one guy goes for Boucher's bag of cash. The whole movie feels like it needed someone to slash half an hour, fix the logical gaffes & smooth out the wildly inconsistent Russian accents.

**Watch the Movie If:**

* You are a Jennifer Lawrence fan.
* You like Steven Soderbergh style slow-burn and low-key thrillers
* You want your all your propaganda-driven impressions of Russia confirmed

**Don’t Watch The Movie If:**

* You are looking for something original
* Stock characters annoy you
* You think sexy = feel-goods


**BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE**

You wanna see a real, holy-shit, edge-of-your-seat espionage drama? Do ya? Well??

Then skip this one. Watch The Americans TV series instead. Every episode of that show is better than this movie.

How do you do this to a movie a movie headlined by Jennifer Lawrence? Or even a movie supported by the likes of Jeremy Irons, Joel Edgerton, Bill Camp and Charlotte Rampling, or a movie directed by Francis Lawrence? How do you make it a through and through ‘meh’?

A shit script, that’s how. More specifically, you do it by writing a story where none of the relationships matter. You do it by writing a story where we care about the main character because she’s played by Jennifer Lawrence, not because the character herself is worth caring about.

The writers of the movie ought to have taken Ron Swanson’s advice: “Don’t half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.” You can almost hear the poor and confused movie asking itself: ‘Am I a spy thriller? Am I a *sexy* spy thriller? Am I a ruthlessly truthful examination of the world of espionage where everyone nevertheless speaks in grindhouse-style dialogue? Do I even *like* me?’

I don’t think the screenwriter believes that people in Russia are allowed to be occasionally happy. Like, they probably don’t even play with puppies. Heck, in a dog-eat-dog world like this, even the puppies probably don’t play with other puppies. 

That’s not to say I hated Red Sparrow. I went to see Jennifer Lawrence, and she acts her frequently centre-screen butt off. So, whatever. Got my money’s worth. In Lawrence’s own words: “Am I good in it? Who can say. I’m naked in the movie, so please go… I’m naked. There’s boobs.”


**AFTER YOU SEE THE MOVIE (HERE BE SPOILERS)**

Lawrence’s unfiltered plea that we ought to go see her movies to check her boobs out shouldn’t be the only reason we go to watch her movies. So what else Red Sparrow has to offer?

**Jennifer Lawrence’s Performance: The only reason this movie will make some money**

Gotta give Lawrence credit for making dull dialogue look good. Coz that’s all the script ever gives her. In fact, Lawrence’s performance here is best during the monosyllabic and silent stretches when the script isn’t forcing her to sound dull. 

The movie did put me in mind of something. Have you seen the [Nerdwriter video essay on Jack Nicholson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK7TiA9qmuU)? Go watch it, and then come back. You will find parallels between Jack Nicholson and Jennifer Lawrence’s acting resumes. Like Nicholson, Lawrence often takes on characters who are filled with rage. Rage at circumstance. Rage at the system. Rage at themselves. Both their talents lie in expressing that rage in colorful displays of passion… or stoicism. You see the latter here, as you did in Winter’s Bone.

There’s been a lot of talk about how hot she is in this movie. It’s true, Lawrence is confidently and disdainfully sexy in this movie. You won’t care. All erotic nuance is drowned in the bleakness of the hell her character goes through. Here, sex equals power, never pleasure. Even in that scene where she seems to bond with Nate Nash (Mr CIA), you’re gonna be unsure whether she’s actually into it or faking it to manipulate him.

**The Screenplay: Meh**

You’ve probably seen better versions of literally every scene in this movie. The absurd plot assumes everyone other than Lawrence is an idiot. The dialogue is written by someone who thinks Russians are a collection of tropes rather than thinking, feeling humans. For a movie dressed up to look stylish as fuck, the dialogue is about as interesting as paint flaking off a wall. Ditto for the much hyped violence, which is completely lacking in spectacle, skill or flair. It’s not a bad script. It’s just thoroughly unoriginal. And unimaginative. I think the script wants us to ask whose side is Red Sparrow really on? The Russians? The Americans? I didn’t care. I just wanted the poor girl to be happy one way or the other.

**The Other Characters: What were their names again?**

Rule one of designing characters: make me give a shit. I don’t have to like the characters. I can hate them if you like. But for all that is good and green on this Earth, give me a character I can emotionally respond to. Other than Lawrence, though, I could give fewer shits about the characters in this movie. Everyone has a cynical, knowing, and dead-eye look. Moments of vulnerability are few and far in-between. Even the usually mischievous Mary Louise Parker, who plays a senator’s chief-of-staff, is reduced to dealing with a jaded sort of snark. 

The movie does not care about relationships. Lawrence has to deal with exactly three: her slimy but polished uncle, her slimy and unpolished embassy boss, and her more-or-less inept CIA agent/boyfriend. And even there, the only character other than Dominika who actually makes you feel something is Boss Letch, because it's genuinely satisfying to see Dominika own him. I mean, Uncle Letch gets his head blown off at the end, and I don’t care. If he had lived, I wouldn’t have cared. There was more on-screen chemistry between James Bond and Jaws than there is between any two characters characters in this movie.

**Production Design: Bleak and cold**

You’ve seen movies with bleak landscapes before (The Revenant). You’ve seen dramas where the camera spends a whole lotta time in stricken close-ups (The Handmaid’s Tale). You’ve seen sets where everything looks depressed (Melancholia). So you know what’s that like when you’re heading into Red Sparrow. Some time in, though, you realize there’s something missing: beauty. In other movies, even the ugliest of worlds has some pretty corner or perspective that touches you, if only to provide a contrast to the harshness of everything else. Not so in Red Sparrow.

The whole thing doesn’t take place in Russia alone. Sometime we’re in Bucharest. At other times we’re in London. Could’ve fooled me. There’s no sense of our Red Sparrow actually going places. If Lawrence did indeed film all these scenes in multiple countries, then I must congratulate the studio for making it feel as if she was shuttling from set piece to set-piece inside a single studio lot. It’s not bad production design. It’s just unimaginative. You may be picking up on a theme here.",81bwds

dw0lx54,"The movie was pretty draggy. Jennifer Lawrence gives her all, but I felt like the script and the director let her down. 

When it is functioning like a spy thriller - connections, drop-offs, cat and mouse conversations, high stakes meetings - it is actually very good, and springs to life. However, those moments are separated by long, rather dull sequences of Lawrence walking down the street or through the foyer of her hotel, or conversations that don't amount to much. The saving grace is that even the duller scenes are shot well, with a great production design, so it is interesting to look at, but that doesn't make you any less impatient for things to start moving. 

The irony is that the thing they sell the movie with - the sparrow training program - is actually the dullest, draggiest part of the film. It takes forever and you find yourself wanting them to just skip to getting her into the field. 

Also, I felt there was no thematic development or follow through on the intriguing main premise:: how to fight back when even your own body and emotional intelligence has been taken over by the state and weaponized. 

On a complete sidenote: Did anybody else find the score intriguing? It was a kind of a lush, orchestral score that you don't really see in these kind of movies anymore.

Jennifer Lawrence was once again great in this, and pulled off a quite convincing Russian accent most of the time. The few times her American accent slipped through were minimal, and didn't really distract from the movie.

What made this movie worth it for me however wasn't Jennifer Lawrence, or the story, but honestly just not quite knowing what she was going to do. The whole movie I spend wondering whether she'd defect, stay with the Russians, find some loophole, escape, or find some other way to surprise us. I'm sure some people guessed what was going to happen early on, but I definitely didn't.

I'm not particularly squeamish about violence or sexual imagery in film or television, but it has to serve the plot in some fashion, otherwise, it just feels manipulative.

Unlike some others, I found much of the plot needlessly complicated. Perhaps in the novel it was presented more clearly, but I had a difficult time believing the betrayals and counterbetrayals. Some of them didn't make much sense to me. Such as when [Dominika manages to convince the Russians that she was captured and tortured in order to gain the Americans' trust.

-It is actually really good on what it proposed itself to be: a unpatriotic bad blooded female double spy.
-She learned at the school to manipulate. Not to fight, not to shoot guns. She played a victim over the whole movie just to rise above the whole situation she was put into: [a daughter with no way to help her mother and threatened by the Russian state.](#spoiler) The unclearness of what she does, motives and acting is a consequence of it. By the end she is not on anyone's side, just on her own. She made her future.
-Disliking a movie for its gore because it triggered bad emotions is such a plain way of appreciating a film.
-Violence and sex were totally necessary. The first sex scene between Nate and Dominika is tied really well into the plot. [she acts a quick, pleasureful sex and he is simply given by her honesty, it seemed that she did it for own pleasure and that was the point where Nate finally gave up and began to truly trust her](#spoiler)

dv8buew,"I am genuinely surprised by all of the negativity around this movie.  One review I saw even said that this was an ""early contender for the razzies.""

I don't think this was a bad movie by any stretch.  Suspenseful, intriguing story with a twist at the end that really caught me off guard.  In fact, the ending was so satisfying that it redeemed the movie for me.  (I'm not going to argue that there aren't plenty of flaws.) 

People described Jennifer Lawrence's performance (and the movie in general) as dull, but in my opinion the mood added to the intrigue, offering a contrast against the many gratuitous scenes.  

I suspect that many people are caught up in the graphic sex scenes and commentary on sexuality.  My opinion on this is nuanced.  I think certain scenes in the movie were over-the-top to the point to where it did feel like I was being exploited.  But as a whole, I would not describe the movie as being exploitative.  If you can sort of accept that the scenes are there, roll your eyes and then move on, the movie is still enjoyable.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that the movie can definitely stand on it's own, and shouldn't just be written off as a soft-core porn staring Jennifer Lawrence.

I like this idea of playing physiological thing (mashup between the sexual theme) and it built up the main character intention in the story. But I do have minus point in this film, from middle untill the end, I loose my self with the story because there are so much things happens.

Love the juxtaposition of the two characters' ""day in the life"", and the expectation subversion that although both characters get their routines ruffled, it's the one with the more docile life who gets physically hurt, not the one who is in constant peril.

Then again, if the movie is realistic people will complain about it not being imaginative enough. Too much sex, not enough. Actors miscast, actors not professional enough. Why can't we just sit down, watch the show and enjoy the ride?

The promotion of Red Sparrow might not have done it any favors. They did make it seem like the beginning of some female James Bond/Jason Bourne super spy movie. Though to their benefit they never really showed a lot of action in the trailers.

Also, outside Hollywood politics, PR, gossip and other things created a less than favorable audience environment.

However...

If we look at the film about a Fictional individual, working as a spy in a fictional world then maybe we can let all of our expectations and take it for what it is.  A  spy movie about a Mada Hari spy groomed by a Russian secret organization. There's nudity but nothing way out there and didn't help move the plot along. This can be said about the tape scenes as well. The movie doesn't really go anywhere that we haven't been before. But at the same time it does introduce us to some surprises. Some positive, some not and yes, some forecasted way before their moment to occur.

All in all an enjoyable movie. Not earth shaking. But better than agreeing to watch your sisters kids just to get access to their liquor cabinet and put stash.

Gratuitous violence has always been interesting, but I do admit, this script seems like it was written by an edgy 16 year old trying to check off every taboo/social immorality at once. Also, for a movie seeming to aim to be female empowerment, it did not offer much there. Not really much empowering about a woman whose job is to give certain men a boner.

e1ku4ad,"Ok, I'll give it to the movie that it was suspenseful and that the cast was doing a great job with what they were given. I also liked the twist(s) at the end. But some of the rest... it just made the whole high-budget, tense thriller fell kind of cheap and sleazy. Some points that immediately come to mind:  

- whore school: really? starting with the bullshit political ""speech"" the headmistress/teacher gave, and continuing with the awkward ""embarrass and/or rape people in front of the whole classroom, that will teach 'em"" idea, it all made *so little* sense. you want proper sex spies? how about properly motivating and educating them, instead of breaking and forcing them, how would that ever work?? in general, all the sex scenes are horrible and exploitative yet somehow voyeuristic, feels more like a cheap thrill for the moviegoers than a tactical element for pro spies. 

- language: so, what are they speaking? I guess we are supposed to assume that ""English with bad Russian accent"" is substituting for ""actual Russian"" for storytelling's sake, and I can live with that (except for that cliche accent). but how is it that they are never paying any thought to Hungarian, the language of the country they are in most of the time? how does our Sparrow manage to buy train tickets in fluent Russian/English, why does the Viennese Bank clerk speak fluent English like that? Again I know it's for the sake of storytelling, but if you live in one of these countries you can't help but notice how unrealistic this all is. gives the whole thing a very ""American"" feel, like they paid no attention to those very real elements of a story playing in these countries because they couldn't conceive of a way to deal with it from across the pond. and it's not as if other movies couldn't do this much better, Bourne Identity comes to mind.   

- all the cliches: bad Russian scheming apparatschiks. poor sick clueless mother. sleazy but ultimately powerless mid boss. good-hearted but tough American hero. slick evil incestuous villain. they were all fine, but a little too ""on the nose"" for me, as if somebody was sticking notes on their backs about who they're supposed to be.",81bwds

The state was trying to pimp her out, and she turned the tables. Dominika's character had some true grit and the cold ass look on Jennifer's face? Ouch! ""Didn't I do well, uncle?""

I could see how it got bad audience reviews, but at the same time I'm confused as to why anyone thought ""Atomic Blonde"" going in based off the trailers. It's much more in line with ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" though not quite as good. 

I think it was just too violent for a lot of people, in a realistic sense. And too much of a slow-burn. As far as the nudity goes I didn't think it was gratuitous at all, given the context, all of it was very unsexy.

They definitely went their own way in a few categories to ""simplify"" things and to let the movie stand on its own (as opposed to needing a sequel). My only complaints that most of the characters didn't seem to be as fully fleshed out as they could've been and the motivations for her defection didn't seem to be as detailed as the book.  
Is it worth seeing? Yes, but be prepared to pay attention and for some gratuitous violence and brutality. As some reviewers have noted, this isn't Atomic Blonde or Black Widow: The Movie, but a le Carre-style thriller, and you'll have some disconnect if you're not expecting that.",81bwds
e08jfpn,"Rotten Tomatoes 52&#37;? Seriously? Competing with movies like Atomic Blonde (serious) and The man From UNCLE (comic/clever), I can't fathom how this movie did better than 20&#37;, It's basically a bad 90s B movie with an upgraded cast. 

It was one of the most painful, wince filled cinematic slogs that I have tried to drag myself through in a long time. Jennifer Lawrence did not pull this disastrous and often disgusting film back from the brink as the writing (for me) fell flat, filled with worn out stereotypes and cliché. Despite Dominika gaining power, her character does not seem to change much through the entire plot, hardly seeming like a human at all. Indeed the rest of the cast (the ones who live through the plot) leave the film without undergoing any perceivable personal change.

Likewise, the plot is a cliche, following Atomic Blonde's general concept pretty well, but failing to convey any necessary hints about Dominika's motivation. Lawrence's acting comes up dramatically short of Theron. Nothing about the series of events leading up to the ambiguous conclusion helps us interpret or care about who Dominika would even want to work for. One test of a good film is to watch it a second time to look for all the little cues left in the earlier story that hinted at the conclusion. A film with solid plot and writing will show you more every time you watch it. Atomic Blonde passes this test, Red Sparrow, if you can stand to watch it a second time, does not. 

Perhaps the only realistic aspect of the film is the chaotic sexual adventure Dominika has, being raped or sleeping with half of the meaningful male characters. The relevance of this misadventure is lost on me. 

The horrid ""russian"" accents were the final cherry on top of this stinky pile. What a way to waste a good cast. ",81bwds

JLaw cares about her mom but we know little to nothing about their relationship, nor what makes her mom worth fighting for other than just being mom. Furthermore, I felt that Dominica lacked autonomy. She may have been trained to be a super spy but far too often it felt like she was being told what to do, that other forces were controlling the plot and she was simply a pawn.

[Although the twist at the end was cool, I felt that it wasn't effectively set-up. The scenes and moments that set it up felt irrelevant and out of place, and it's not until the end that they make sense. It didn't feel like a massive revelation of all the pieces coming together, it felt more like ""Oh right, she did that, I almost forgot."" In contrast, I think of The Shawshank Redemption; the steps Andy takes in his grand scheme are hidden within scenes that have their own objectives. At face value, we think Andy is doing one thing, but he's secretly doing another, so at the end we have our minds blown and appreciate Andy's brilliance for subtly executing his plan without even the audience noticing. Whereas in Red Sparrow, Dominica steals a drinking glass and peeps at her uncle's wallet and we're like ""Okay...?"" and it's not nearly as compelling.](#spoiler)

I laughed when I saw the 5'10"" husky JLaw doing ballet.  :)  I'm sure JLaw's accent was hilarious to Russian-speaking people too.  

Was Charlotte Rampling doing British or Russian accent?  I could have sworn she had a British accent when she first meets JLaw, then 2 scenes, later, she's doing a weird Russian accent.  I'm really disappointed in her because she's supposed to be a real actress.",81bwds

dv56r4g,"My thoughts:

* This movie was very flawed to say the least. It could've been edited into a much leaner movie imo. It clocks in at 2h20m which, due to troubled pacing, really felt like a drag to me. I think they should've cut about 3/4 of the 'whore school' stuff as well as some other scenes that don't really attribute to anything.
* The accents ruined the immersion for me most of the time. J-Law slips in and out of it constantly and Jeremy Irons isn't even trying to do an accent. Tbh, I don't even understand why ""Russians speak English with Russian accents to other Russians"" is still a thing in modern movies.
* I did like [both twists](#spoiler) and the scenes with [Swan](#spoiler) though. Also, I think the [torture scenes](#spoiler) were very well done so at least it wasn't a total waste of time.",81bwds
dveidee,"1/10. One of the very worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing (was dragged along to this.) A complete embarrassment for everyone involved from the bottom up. The hilarious thing is Hollywood-America loves to talk about how much brainwashing and propaganda other countries are involved in, yet the entire movie was just hate-filled garbage pissing down on Russia. Russian people were basically presented as soulless, ruthless, robotic whores, while the Americans the ""enlightened"" saviors. And the bad dude was the likeness of a young Putin. Har-har. I mean even if the Russian government is indeed horrible; this movie's storyline just stuck out as a sore turd of hate against anything and everything Russia. Bloated ""twist and turn"" plot that goes nowhere interesting, and characters without any real personality. Not a single redeeming quality of any kind.",81bwds

Despite all of this, though, if you just watch it and try not to judge too harshly, I found it to be a very enjoyable film. The cinematography was quality, the tension was well-handled, the pacing was good, the story was interesting. The acting was amazing at points.

If you read a lot of reviews, a lot of the negativity revolves around sexuality being used as a plot device, Lawrence's character being a poor representative of a strong woman, etc etc.  Meh. It's a shame the movie got destroyed by critics just due to the current political climate.

dvsaenp,"Of the films I've seen so far this year (Annihilation, The Strangers: Prey at Night, Winchester, The Ritual, and The Open House), this is the worst I've seen in a long while. And for the record I'm not a jlaw hater, or was expecting another Atomic Blonde action spy thriller. There's no real point to this film even being made, it's torture porn and exploitation masquerading as some pro-feminist something or other, but comes across confused and misguided in whatever message its going for. Beyond that it's just not very compelling and a whole lot to do about nothing. I love a long slow burn, but this one just isn't rewarding at all and doesn't warrant the run-time. 

I did like the opening sequence, but that's pretty much about it. I'm tempted to give it a zero, but I've seen worse, yet this one just made me really frustrated and angry. I don't know what Lawrence was going for signing up for this one other than to take on another ""mature"" role. Despite it sort of making her a hypocrite. 

And this is coming from someone who loved 'mother!'. 

Seriously, don't waste your time. Just rent it, if that. ",81bwds
dv3xszs,"I thought this movie was fine, but not great.  Jennifer Lawrence gave a good performance in everything except her accent, and I thought Matthias Schoenaerts was great.  I haven't seen him in anything except *The Drop* which didn't grab me, but he was totally believable in this as the scummy uncle/high ranking Russian  officer.

There were a few sequences I really liked, namely the Sparrow training scenes. They reminded me of some similar flashback scenes from *The Americans*, which to be honest is a much better thing to watch if you want US/Russian conflict.

There was more about the movie that I didn't like.  It doesn't really feel like  it takes place in modern times, which it's ostensibly supposed to. It's probably a half hour longer than it needs to be, and the plot is probably one subplot more convoluted than it needs to be.

I give it 3/5, but I could be talked into 2/5.  If you have Moviepass or cheap local tickets go for it, but its probably not worth a full price cinema trip.  ",81bwds

Sloppy accents and a script that needed another draft aside, it was actually kind of refreshing to see the extent that the film would go to show exactly how huge and violent repercussions could be and then seeing the main character trying to navigate through this fucked up situation she found herself in. Don't go in expecting just another spy thriller, this film is legitimately brutal.",81bwds

[It's not that had to be the case, but the film didn't treat it as an interesting possibility for the tension to rise. Lawrence just believed him and things went smooth so very, very conveniently.

At first I really wasn't feeling the movie too much, but I ended up really liking it once you see at the end her true objective. I never felt suspense on whether or not she was team russia or team USA. It seemed very clear she was on the US side and wasn't going to be derailed from trying to get away from Russia.

dv7x1q0,"I don't think this is a spy movie. I mean it had spying in it but it's not a spy movie. I think this movie is about women. How society sees women, the way women are treated and what women have to go through to get anywhere.

I think the movie is WAY too long but was beautifully and purposefully photographed. 

I thought Jennifer Lawrence's performance was brave, uncompromising, challenging and important but weirdly un-engaing and not charismatic. 

Setting it in modern day but filming it like it's 1978 made little to no sense - also what laptop uses floppy discs in 2017?

I think that the graphic violence and nudity in the movie was definitely difficult to watch but not necessary to make the point they were trying to make. It also limits the audience for a film like this that has an important message. That being said, it definitely adds a raw intensity and a confrontational, unblinking tone to the story that it does benefit from in hindsight. 

I also think if you want to make a serious and gritty movie that's about something, you shouldn't have so many redone 70s spy movie cliches in it.

I love Jeremy Irons but he didn't even try with an accent lmao he sounded like Alfred.

The movie was way more graphic and violent than I expected and I felt myself wincing at most of it (which ain't a bad thing) it was just pretty gruesome.

I'm also wondering whether JLaw is exposing more of herself now as she flashed a fair bit of skin this movie (and in *mother!*) I suspect body doubles at work but there's far more nudity and prolonged sexual scenes than you'd expect.

I just watched it and I personally loved the movie exactly for all the things you mentioned. I felt it was exactly right in how viceral and disgusting it was, but it never overdid it. It wasn't non-stop gore for the sake of gore, or sex or relationships for the sake of appealing to a viewers hormones.

Every bit of the disturbing parts was shown in an artful manner, and was only in the movie to begin with because it had to emphasize the kind of world and situation the characters were in. It wasn't a happy Hollywood blockbuster. It wasn't one with tons of gadgets, or safety-nets where entire squads are ready to bust the door down once 'their' spy is in danger.

True gritty spycraft at that level is an emotionally draining affair that no sane person ought to ever want to do for the sake of its own profession.

I wish this part of the movie could have been communicated more clearly to people like you before they went to see the movie, but I guess you can't really put such nasty stuff in your trailer.

dv2870c,"I don’t necessarily disagree that it was unbelievable, but I’ll counter a few points because why not. 

Her being a ballerina helped her get the first dude unprotected when he went to her room. The dude wanted her and her uncle knew that. Her uncle also wanted her, thought she was good at reading people like him, and knew she had seductive powers perfect for a sparrow.

The recruit she beat up was trying to rape her, and you could make the argument it showed she’d make a good sparrow because she could protect herself and was strong enough to take out a male military dude. And even though she didn’t follow some rules, she clearly understood people’s motives and what drives them, and how to get what she wanted. Also the mole was involved in letting her off for that, so maybe he liked her rebelliousness.

The spy she roomed with did hide the documents, maybe a safe would have been better, or maybe more obvious.

It’s also not fully clear she switched sides immediately. She was never a willing participant in the Russian cause to begin with. But there was also some unreliable narrator happening where she might have been pretending to switch sides to gain the American’s trust. She knew he’d check her out and figured she’d use her connections to her advantage in getting him involved with her.

In terms of them not hiding very well, both sides knew they were trying to use the other side for info, so it wasn’t a secret to either side. Maybe the Russians didn’t capture and torture the American spy because they thought he’d be more likely to talk to a seductress over a torturer.

In meeting the senator’s chief of staff, the Americans knew the Russians knew about it, that’s why they had the fake discs. 

She was putting the pieces in place to set up her uncle for a while, but we thought she was planning her own escape—getting the American money and putting it in the bank etc. You also don’t necessarily need lots of spy training to be smart and crafty with a strong sense of self-preservation and a thirst for revenge.

That girl was an example of a person having to break through personal morals. The Matron knew this girl had a problem with this subject, and that it would be something she'd have to be trained on, so she used her as an example of how every student - no matter how much all of them excelled as soldiers - has things they would be very much opposed against doing. For some it might be taking a life. For others it might be fellatio. Yet another might not be willing to harm a child.

Perhaps the 'failed' example would be better served to have a man perform fellatio on another man, but then you'd run afoul of homophobic tendencies in audiences. (It has sex, it has gore, but for some people none of that matters... but gay stuff does...)

e067gru,"> The promotion of Red Sparrow might not have done it any favors. They did make it seem like the beginning of some female James Bond/Jason Bourne super spy movie. Though to their benefit they never really showed a lot of action in the trailers.

I checked the trailers just now after having seen the movie first.

Honestly, I am not sure what they could have done to the trailers to make it look more boring. There were no gun battles (OK, save for Nate running up to the Embassy going ""DON'T SHOOT!!!"") and everything else were scenic picture of cold russia and either luxurious hotels or dumpy-looking rooms.

Pretty much everything in the trailer itself points towards 'thriller' and 'intrigue'. The only reason why it gives off a remotely glamorous and actiony vibe is because JL walks around looking pretty in an expensive dress in one or two scenes in a way you'd expect from Hollywood stuff like Covert Affairs or whatever which do that for every single moment.

I feel the movie fell victim to the modern 'Netflix era' where everything looks rich and expensive, very CGI-esque polished and involves lots of bullets and action. It can hardly go out of its way to say 'no big gun battles, no big explosions, just tons of grit, subtle intrigue and a few bits of shocking sexuality and gore' in its trailer.",81bwds

I think the old computer was put there cause it looked organic in the environment they were trying to create: everything Russian in this film was portrayed as being grey, dull, old, outdated, cold, snowy, depressing and well-worn.

2). Red stars are still commonly featured in many things in Russia, especially when it comes to government and millitary stuff.

Lawrence is good in it, although I think it suffers a little through no fault of her own because her character is so unrelentingly stoic - she gets to play a good badass, but since she's keeping a poker face in enemy territory for most of the film we also only get little bursts of emotion and personality from her: the character loves her mom and periodically breaks down crying behind closed doors, and that's about it. Lawrence and Joel Edgerton were also a bit of a ""meh"" combo casting-wise, again nothing awful but no especial chemistry between them.

dv7pel0,"You're right. However, in reality there's an understanding that neither side would shoot someone when there is a spy swap. The movie diverts drastically from the book in a number of ways, and this is one of them: [In the book, the swap is done on a bridge between Finland and Russia (IIRC). The swap also was for MARBLE, not the uncle. MARBLE tricked Dominika into unwittingly identifying himself as the mole. He orchestrated it as a way to make her untouchable and allow her to take his place while he retired to live in the US.

Other than that, there are more specific character changes in the book that I'd rather not spoil.

Overall I feel as if the changes were necessary to condense a 17 hour (audio book) story into 2 hours and 20 min. The movie had the same spirit as the book in a more lean story.

This story definitely doesn't demand a whole lot of analysis or deep introspection, but even so, I didn't find it tedious or boring like some others here did. I think the simplistic storytelling served the movie well, in fact. 

And calling it torture porn? While it does have brutal scenes involving torture, I don't feel like they went overboard ever. Obviously it all depends on your tolerance. That contrasting with the simplistic, straightforward, and, at times, mundane story makes those scenes more memorable and seem more prevalent in the movie, but I viewed them more as punctuation rather than the main attraction. 

It was mainly a very linear, uncomplicated tale of revenge and I understand why people were let down. You invest so much time in this movie, and it really doesn't build up to anything. 

I see that as a strength of the movie, though. It's not a big, high stakes, unravelling of many threads. It's just a single thread picture. It just happens to be a very long single thread. But I personally found that long single thread somewhat interesting.",81bwds

I think this is where the problem is that you are dealing with a movie with A-list actors produced in Hollywood. You aren't going to see them produce a movie where the USA doesn't at the very least play even. The other 99% of the time, the USA outright wins at whatever. It is the entire patriotic thing.

Just that knowledge makes the ending a given, and takes away from the suspense. If for even a minute I could have allowed myself to believe that the Russian side might be the 'winners' of this movie, it would have been far more suspenseful.

e066gik,"I disagree. I thought it was done expertly. Every single bit of violence, abuse, sex and gore was done to drive home the situation the characters found themselves in as well as what was at stake.

This wasn't your average Hollywood flick where a person shoots someone in the knee three times until they desperately squeal. This wasn't a movie where sex and seduction purely happens in five star hotel rooms and both sides look like amazing people who got really lucky acting what they did.

This was a movie where everything was a weapon, and everything was a weakness. And like an enemy ought to do, they went for all the 'cheap' shots that result in a maximum effect, no matter how tasteless it might be. If we were talking about a brawl, it would be knees in the groin and shooting someone in the back. But this was a spy thriller. The only way to know someones motives and true allegiances is to push them to their breaking point again and again until you are convinced they are not going to betray you during that one moment where they can actually screw you over big time.

Was it grotesque at points? Yes. But it was also artfully done; no excessive gore or anything. It was exactly what the movie needed, and imho it was wonderful for knowing where to draw the line with maximum effect.",81bwds

dv5topt,"For why she was let out of (graduated) the spy school, I agree it was the Mole's cynicism. Remember she had the conversation with the Mole where they both agreed that there are many different lives. That is when she inadvertently established rapport with him. Prior to that, he wanted her dead. What I do like is how it showed that she used the training she learned at the school (picking locks, using the powder stuff) and it was actually integral to the plot. 

I agree that she never switched sides, technically. She was out to get her uncle from the beginning, or at least before meeting Nash. It's not until the very last scene that it's suggested she's helping the Americans for a reason not related to getting back at her uncle, and even then it could be only because they had blackmail info on her.

Her success isn't due to luck, she would have been killed three or four times but for her uncle's protection. Since she showed herself to the Americans as a double agent to begin with, the only ones with reason to hurt her were the Russians. So she was protected from two sides.

One thing that this movie had going for it above Atomic Blonde is that it actually has more character development for the main lead. In the first major violent incident, Dominika doesn't realize she is being manipulated by her uncle, she is just out for revenge against the other two dancers. She fails to assess the motive of why she was given that information. In the second violent incident, she failed to anticipate the motivation of the Rich Guy and what he would do to her.

After that however, she always stays one step ahead (having had a very visceral taste of what would happen if she didn't) and uses many ingenious methods to protect her 'honor', ranging from outright refusal, choosing 'a boy', violence, psychological manipulation, and blackmail. Telling people what they want to hear, her uncle most of all, becomes her religion that she even stakes her life on, as shown after the torture scene.",81bwds

Sure, yeah she gives up her uncle, the man who forced her into sparrow school, it flashes back to her planting a glass he held, and planting incriminating evidence throughout the film.

We see her being celebrated in full Russian uniform, it seems like she has been promoted, she looks to be in the kremlin and everyone cheers for her, the actual mole is in the audience.

Instead, she basically uses all the things that she set up throughout the movie (which wasn't revealed until the end when they do the exchange) to set up her uncle as the mole. At the exchange, the Americans all don't realize she did this, and when they remove the bag off her uncles head, they see it's her uncle.

The plot device of the true mole was brilliantly devised.

Yes, one can be smug and pretend they knew how it was going to end, but they are lying.  We had clues, but at no time did we know how the ends were going to be revolved.  

I think it was masterfully written and paced.  The actual mole was never even hinted at and no clue to his identity was given.  Because of that element, all the reveals revealed nothing but what the viewer intuited.

Both sides spying on the other, how do we differentiate that one side is bad? It’s a movie about a woman who is forced to become a sex spy. So it follows there’d be forced sex.

1. The torture sequence occurs outside of Russia, in Budapest. So you could argue there is more deniability. Additionally the torture sequence is done less to get information from the CIA officer and more as a test of loyalty for Lawrence's character.

2. The CIA are planning to just arrest her when she comes out since they have all the info and she would be caught red handed. Her leaving the hotel early screws up the plan, since no one expects her to leave and make poor decisions. 

3. Why do you know she would defect? Did she defect? My impression of Lawrence's character is that she is not idealogically driven but revenge driven. Early in the film, after discovering her injury was intentional she assaults those responsible. [Then she is forced to perform a task for her uncle which goes south. The rest of the film from that point is her seeking revenge against her uncle.](#spoiler) Everything else is just a means to an end. 

4. It makes the movie more dramatic, you get to use the visual of Lawrence in the gun sights to build tension and offer a potential fake-out.

He had come to Jerusalem to worship 28 and was returning, **seated in his chariot**,

Just in case /u/outrider567 is reading, Chariots have wheels. Fun fact: Ramses II had died by the 19th century. Ancient Egypt was heavily influenced by the Nubians. They ruled Egypt as Pharaohs for almost two hundred years, a few years before the 19th century. Fun fact 2: Nubians were black africans.

[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Debre_Damo_Church.jpg)'s a picture of a 6th century Ethiopian church. To give you some historical context, that's roughly 1300 years before /u/outrider567's ancestors stopped living in a hut made of animal shit and twigs. I'm being charitable, so I'm assuming /u/outrider567's peasent ancestors weren't still living in a shack made of cow shit in the 19th century. 

e: On a side note, I noticed /u/outrider567 managed to misuse an apostrophe when claiming black africans have low ""IQ**'**s"". 

I hope I may make the observation that it's rather ironic that /u/outrider567, makes basic grammar mistakes in his native language when calling other people stupid. I say basic because unlike /u/outrider567, even though English is my third language, I somehow managed to grasp the incredibly difficult concept of how to use apostrophes in English some time ago.

>The CIA are planning to just arrest her when she comes out since they have all the info and she would be caught red handed. Her leaving the hotel early screws up the plan, since no one expects her to leave and make poor decisions.

Not really. The logical conclusion is since the fsb arranged the meeting, they would have look outside set up. Why not let her go and arrest her later? Like she is a senatorial aid, her schedule would be predictable. Why risk blowing the entire mole for no benefit?



>Why do you know she would defect? Did she defect? My impression of Lawrence's character is that she is not idealogically driven but revenge driven.

She absolutely joined the Americans and became a double agent. It made it really clear at the end. 

But revenge as a motive is shit for the fsb. Getting out of a minor assault charge is also terrible from the fsb perspective. She is trying to avoid jail time and get her mom help. So any organization who promises that to her has her loyalty. So from the fsb perspective, she is an extremely shitty candidate not factoring in her own revenge. 

Also the fsb made it clear that she would die if she didn't spy. That's terrible motivation. In the 50s, Soviet agents were leaving right and left to avoid Stalin's purges. What's to stop her from just joining the Americans and escape death?

While this quote is sadly from a forum, it is one of the most generalized and plain English explanations I could find. 

“As the target concentration of propofol approached steady state at a reasonable concentration, you lost consciousness. You might have experienced a period of sleepiness or impending sleep at the time but have no memory of that period as a normal consequence of the drug. Unconsciousness does not necessarily mean you would stop breathing and in a healthy patient in the lateral position with your face easily accessible by the anesthesiologist, it would not be unusual or (dare I say) unsafe to have you unconsious and breathing on your own.”
https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/anesthesia-for-colonoscopy.532185/

The response from an anesthesiologist on the medicine sub told me that typically he will use general anesthesia without paralysis. He doesn’t even necessarily use a regional nerve block.

There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" when dealing with the subjective. Siskel and Ebert used thumbs, some people rate based off of how much nudity, some rate by profanity, some off of body count. Whatever works for you, works for you.
