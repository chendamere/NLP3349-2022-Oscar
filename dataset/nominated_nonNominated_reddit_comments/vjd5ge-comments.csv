idiufdz,"Saw it tonight and I loved it. Horror is my favorite genre and it’s rare for me to be blown away by a horror movie. I never read the story it’s based on but I’ll give my thoughts anyway. 

There will most likely be spoilers 

Loved the music. Actors were great

I have 2 toddlers and if you’ve ever seen Blippi, the Grabber reminded me of a psycho demented version of Blippi with his creepy voice. 

I didn’t expect to cry! The scenes with Gwen getting hit with the belt and then Finn’s last phone call with Robin made me cry. I really loved Robin as a character and the amount of growth they gave him in such a small amount of parts. 

I wondered if the phone really worked or if Finn had a spirit gift like his sister did, except that instead of having dreams or visions, he could talk to the dead. Because they were like “no one’s ever heard the phone ring until you.” 
But then they said the grabber hears it too. So I don’t know. 

Those masks are going to be everywhere come Halloween time

Really good thriller.",vjd5ge
idii06w,I feel like this movie could have been about 30 minutes longer and I wouldn’t mind. Delving more into the history of the 5 kids before Finn. I did love that he used each piece of knowledge the 5 kids before him gave him to defeat the grabber. That was a nice touch.,vjd5ge

ididq7x,"Absolutely loved Madeleine McGraw's performance as Fin's sister. Her ""Dear Jesus, what the fuck?"" and calling the detectives ""stupid fucking fart knockers"" when they started to disregard what she was saying got the biggest laughs in my theater. 

I loved seeing the relationship between the brother and sister remain close and feel realistic. Fin's actor was exceptional too, especially in the scenes with Ethan Hawke. The whole movie was a solid horror-thriller with some excellent high-tension sequences, brutal surprise moments, and an all around terrifying atmosphere.",vjd5ge

Feels very Stephen King in all the best ways (makes sense since his son wrote the short story); vague but powerful supernatural elements, facing personal traumas wrapped up in other other evils, etc. It strikes a really solidly creepy tone, and Hawke’s villain turn is really menacing. Loved the 70s aesthetic and soundtrack too. Very solid 7/10, it’s refreshingly old school and genuinely spooky.",vjd5ge

idixft3,"So from what I understand, the dead kids were in a another plane of existence and they were finally able to communicate with Finney because he and his sister had some sort of mind gift (clearly from their mother as their father mentions she had dreams too). So Finney is the first taken child to hear the phone like the kids say in the movie, he communicates with them while the sister gets visions of their lives, eventually with them leading her to the bodies. Still wondering about the Grabber’s history and why he seems to have multiple personalities. Or why he was grabbing his face in pain when his mask was removed. Overall a well done film that had me invested. Not some masterpiece but it didn’t try to be, there was a strong entertainment factor.",vjd5ge

idtir4p,"The Black Phone - BREAK DOWN

Ethan Hawke brought me here btw.

This movies is about broken people & survivors. The affects of abuse, and how the abused become abusers, bullies, & sometimes murderers.

Throughout the movie the main characters Finn, and his sister Gwen were suffering some type of abuse. Whether it be by their father at home, whom they had to be as quiet as mice not to set him off, or the school bullies who terrorized them.

The abuse makes Gwen accepting of violence, she uses a brick as a girl to help her brother fight, but it makes Finn turn inward and accepting of abuse.

Keep this in mind.

The actual black phone represents HOPE, it’s not attached to the wall, there is no connection to the outside world, the Grabber keeps telling him the phone doesn’t work, but he gets mad whenever he see’s Finn with the phone in his hand.

The grabber was beaten until he was broken, abused until he gave up hope, before he kills his victims, he wants them to give up on all hope of being saved.

This leads to the “Naughty Boy” game. The grabber plays a game, where he brings down food with the smiling mask, and purposely leaves the door open, but waits in the kitchen belt in hand, the mask he wear now has a scowl due to him, switching up the bottom half. The grabber wants you to try to escape so he can then beat you. I believe this is a reenactment of the abuse he received as a child. Because Fin has abusive father he knows how to not to set off the abuser, he refuses to play the game several times, when he does play, he energy escapes due to knowing how to be extremely quiet.

Also there is a part to where the Grabber has a the top part his mask off, with tears in is eyes, he watches Fin while the boy sleeps. I believe the killer is mourning his own innocence that was taken as he watched the boy sleep. A lot of abusers are envious of their prey, if they were withdrawn they may envy your confidence, if they were bullied, they may envy your fight, etc.

In the end the only way out of the house is through the bully, the abuser, the grabber.

Finn has to face his fears, and finally stand up for himself. 

During the fight, Finn breaks the mask, and exposes the Grabbers whole face, which makes the killer FREAK OUT.

My take away from that is the Grabber can’t reveal who he really is until it’s time to kill you.  He is ashamed of what he has become, he’s dying inside, he wants to die , but can’t bring himself to do it. 

So re-enacts his abuse on people who were around his age when he lost himself.  He knows what he is doing is horrible , to deflect he wears a mask to become the person he needs to become to do the things he feels compelled to do.

This is a GREAT MOVIE!",vjd5ge
idiqmks,"Did anyone else almost cry at the final phone call, and whenever >!the siblings reunite!<",vjd5ge
ie94gad,One of my favourite scenes was when Gwen reunited with Finn in the end. Not gonna lie but almost cried I don’t know why. She really involved me so much in her character. What a performance!!! The chemistry of them two was unreal,vjd5ge
idip0u5,"I absolutely loved it.

Loved the supernatural angel as both a way to bring horror and emotional weight to the movie. I wound up caring about the other victims and them getting their justice. 

The sister plot was great too... broke the tension and had some surprising comic relief.

The main players of the cast were pretty strong as a whole. But Ethan Hawke was on another level... absolutely rocked it even though some doubted him in this type of role. He's sneakily one of the best actors going today.

Would definitely recommend this... horror is having a pretty good year",vjd5ge
ief9nsy,“DUMB FUCKING FART-KNOCKERS!!!”,vjd5ge
idvmmku,"I feel like this entire movie was a allegory for child abuse and the failure of support structures around children to identify and fix the issue. I was particularly struck by the line that went something like ""you remian invisible until you make the paper and then everyone knows your name"". 

Every kid who was kidnapped before Finn had an escape plan that failed. It wasn't until Fin combined all of those plans into his own and stood up for himself that he was able to escape his situation. Much the same in abuse situations more often than not no single solution works, and many times the system fails the kid. It's an infiri commentary on the system that kids have to climb on the backs of those who have died because I'd the failure of the system, to save themselves. But that's how it is. It's brutal.

I'm probably reading too much into it.",vjd5ge

idifmnf,Love the the movie but did anyone absolutely hate the brother? Not the character but just that it was completely unnecessary and only complicates the plot imo. The brothers like obsessed with finding the kids yet doesn’t notice anything weird about his brother or the basement. The kid could technically scream anytime he left the room and the brother would most likely hear it. Did the grabber lock his brother in his room at night or something cause couldn’t he bump into his brother passed out in a chair with a mask and belt?,vjd5ge
ie50d7g,"I loved the movie. I give it a 9/10. Just gonna list my scattered thoughts:

- Title theme music felt a little reminiscent of Halloween and John Carpenter themes to me.

- Some of the acting in the beginning was a little iffy for me, and I’m not just talking the kid actors. The actor who played Finney was on point for the whole movie tho.

- They totally pulled a Silence of the Lambs at the end, which I had a feeling they might do, however I like that they kind of subverted it by having it be where the bodies were hidden.

- I’m a little disappointed there wasn’t a black phone in the other house’s basement just to hint at them calling from their graves, but whatever.

- Really liked the inclusion of the sister’s telepathic dreams. It made a good subplot that also tied in to the grabber well with the flashes of the victims’ past.

- Almost forgot about the cocaine brother. He was hilarious! I love me some dramatic irony.

This was the only Scott Derickson movie I’ve seen besides Doctor Strange, but now I definitely want to check out Sinister.",vjd5ge
idjm3zf,"Can someone give me some Jeremy Davies roles where he plays someone unbelievably awesome? So far I'm now looking at him as an alcoholic child abuser who got half of his squad killed because he was a coward. And he fucked his mom. Dickie Bennett, the child abusing literal motherfucker. My mind is about to give him Paul Dano status, wherein I'll hope he gets his ass kicked in every movie I see him in.

I know he was Faraday, but that was a minor role. No one's takeaway from Lost was ""Fucking hell, Faraday was shit hot. Terry O'Quinn is overrated.""",vjd5ge

idie5yp,"I saw this tonight and thought it was great. Super satisfying ending, good performances, a few top-notch jump scares. Also wanted to shout out the scene with the dad belting the daughter. Feels weird to give that scene credit but it really put me on edge.

EDIT: Also wanted to add how great the non-horror parts of this movie are. I could totally have watched a movie just about these kids growing up in 70s Denver. The opening scenes kind of reminded me of a dirtier Dazed and Confused with the baseball and classic rock soundtrack.",vjd5ge
idistul,"It was decent. Movie reminded me of The Lovely Bones, in that I can tell it was probably an amazing book but ended up translating just OK to movie form.

Pros: Basically everything outside of the actual plot was awesome. The sound design was great, the main characters were charming, likable + well acted. The creepy moments were well done. The climax subverted my expectations in a nice way, Finnie basically rescued himself completely despite the movie trying to telegraph that the sister would come save the day, it was a welcomed subtle touch to the overall theme of the movie. A great moment engraved into my head is when Finnie is practicing his attack moves on the phone with Robin and they get in perfect sync. Very dope. Also, the brother obsessing over the mystery and not realizing its in his brother’s house was fucking hilarious.

Cons: The plot felt very thin tbh. I was really hoping there was gonna be a bit more of a twist to the supernatural elements or the Grabber as a character. So i left the theater feeling pretty underwhelmed. It never quite felt like the movie found its groove after a slow first half, and thats simply due to the screenplay the movie was based off of. Kudos for Scott Derrickson for making it more entertaining than it probably should have been, this guy is talented",vjd5ge

idic79s,"Am I just soft or did middle schoolers really fight like the fucking Sopranos in the 70s? Surprised Gwen just walked away without police trouble after cracking that kid's skull open lmao. 

Color me impressed on this one. Horror isn't my favorite genre so I wasn't sure if I'd love this, but even with the supernatural stuff and the (well done) jump scares, this worked really well as a very satisfying thriller. Solid child acting, a story that's not totally predictable, and a really enigmatic and interesting performance from Hawke. 

I thought the kids were written and acted really well which isn't always a given in movies like this. All the supporting roles, really, including the father and Max. Great use of Daniel Farraday and Ziggy. But the relationship between Finney and Gwen is the core here, and it's really well done which makes the ending really heartfelt. 

Speaking of satisfying endings, I loved that this movie ends with the kid beating the absolute fuck out of Hawke. Such a hard-core thing to put your child character through and most movies like this would have the cops bust in at the right time. It felt like this movie purposely pivoted from that to give us a more unpredictable ending. 

The tension in scenes like the combination lock scene, or trying to get out of the window scene were really well done. Just some top tier direction and acting there. 

One thing I thought was really cool were how the movie would imply rules to the phone but not bog itself with them. We get the sense that some of the kids are in the room with him, but later it's implied they may be living through a scene from their life and the lines they're using have multiple meanings. This is enforced by the fact that even calls before that seem to repeat themselves, and of course the very satisfying ending where each kid got to say their piece to Hawke. But at the same time, it doesn't force itself to do that for every kid every time. It's just kind of implied that these kids are existing in several different planes of existence. Very well done. 

At the end of the day, this has better writing, acting, direction, and a better look than most movies of the same genre. Hawke was really unhinged and a true creep, but performances all around were selling the whole thing. I'd give this a solid 8/10. Absolutely recommend.

ie57bf0,"When I first saw this poster for this movie, and saw the name Ethan Hawke, I was in. Then, seeing the trailer, made me less interested because it seemed like a tone that I wouldn’t really like. 

But after seeing it tonight, I thought the movie walked a fine line between presenting a creepy tale, but also putting you in the POV of a child and presenting you with some supernatural elements that were easy to believe.

Very much a Stephen King universe story—children in peril, bullies, supernatural powers akin to The Shining, small town in Colorado—even thought it is from the mind of his son.

Hawke and the two kids are great and it's very atmospheric, but Hawke's in it a lot less than I was expecting and the whole phone concept feels kinda one-note and repetitive. I was hoping the gimmick would kinda go in some more creative directions but there's not a whole lot to it.

Also the subplot with the sister felt really tacked on, even though I thought the actress who played the sister was really really good.

I would've preferred it to just stay with the brother and maintain a sense of claustrophobia rather than cutting back outside.

Hawke's brother also felt like a character who didn't even need to be in this. I like James Ransone as much as the next guy but his character was just nothing.

Overall it just felt weirdly ordinary to me - a conventional 3-star thriller that lacked a little tension and doesn't at all live up to those critical raves.",vjd5ge

idz8nw6,"I hesitated to bring up the damn Shining.  BUT...

Finn's little Science Club rocket that he carries around immediately made me think of Danny in his Apollo rocket sweater at the Overlook hotel.  Then I'm thinking of other parallels...similar haircut and appearance, they both have abusive dads, both become isolated with a killer.

Here's why I loved this and felt like it was more than just baiting film nerds for reviews, or just a shout to Stephen King since the short story was written by Joe Hill, his son.

In addition to the ghost kids who were advising Finn to help him escape and overcome the Grabber, it felt like Finn was also on a continuum with kids from other horror movies.  It felt like an acknowledgement that these characters are now shaped by a long history in cinema, while they bring something new to an ongoing story about kids who end up having to overcome the oblivion, misunderstanding, or outright violence from the adults around them.

Danny sees the twins who died in the Overlook Hotel and Finn hears the voices of the kids who died in this dungeon before he was brought there.  Their insight helps them both save themselves.  But Danny was still vastly alone in isolation, and Finn becomes connected with the kids who were there before him, even rivals and bullies (who were also victims.)

It was fine and I kinda got what I was expecting for the most part, but I'll echo some of the sentiment I've seen shared on here by others:


- while the sister was great, correct me if I'm wrong but the only thing she really ends up accomplishing in the film is just figuring out where the bodies are buried, she does nothing for the ""main"" plot, so I think that could've been thrown away for the most part as to leave more screentime for Finney/Grabber;


- Hawke was great but man, so criminally underused;


- Same goes for the whole phone thing, that was supposed to be ""the thing"" going into the movie, but then not a whole lot of interesting/creative stuff is done with it. Yes, every kid has its moment and all that, but it was all rather... plain, and not exactly creative? And then the way the Grabber goes out just seems unexpectedly... easy? I don't know.

It does not suffer from ""horror characters doing stupid things because movie needs to happen"" tropes. It does have some extreme credulity-straining ideas: I think this obviously creepy dude driving around a comically suspicious black van would have raised some eyebrows, no? Also, the brother being in that house and not noticing any of the funny business until the last minute is insane and a fairly pointless inclusion.

Funniest part was the sister's ""prayer"" to Jesus near the 3rd act.

Regarding comments about not seeing enough of the Grabber: the writer made the choice to only ever depict him from the perspective of victims, which worked out. If they added some additional backstory for this guy, like explaining his whole MO or what happened to make him like this, it might've ended up cheesy or nonsensical and ruined the plot. Also, it would've made the movie a little bit too long, considering this is standard 90-minute horror.",vjd5ge

idy27yx,"Really liked this - I saw it as a movie about destiny and things happening for a reason so liked how the sister was going through that religious struggle while Fin's struggle was effectively validating that things do happen for a reason in the end. I was surprised how moved I was by all of the other kid's advice leading into Fin's victory, and the last call with learning how to fight was great. 

It did leave me wanting more in regards to the Grabber's backstory (assuming him hearing the phone has an element of him being an abuse victim also to it?) and the supernatural, but definitely a good movie.",vjd5ge
idiva96,"Totally have an unpopular opinion here based on the discussion (which is good, love to see different perspectives!) but I thought this movie was BAD. I didn’t think Ethan Hawke was scary until the very end, the kid acting was terrible besides the main two, and it all felt like I was waiting for a big reveal that never came. I thought there was no reveal about Ethan Hawke’s character as it related to his motives, his back story, or anything like that. Weird shots and editing techniques I didn’t like. Thought there was obvious things Finney should have done, like hitting The Grabber over the head with the toilet cover (that somehow didn’t break smashing into literal concrete walls). Plus, the Grabber didn’t ever bother to look in the bathroom area or notice the missing window gate? Considering the one kid tore the wall down and got into the freezer, it seems obvious to me that would be something Hawke has to check for now. 

The father character seemed underdeveloped to me—abusive but suddenly accepts his daughter’s dreams? And we are supposed to believe he’s sorry at the end? Also felt like there was no explanation to the hallucinations (or actual visions) of the dead kids and the phone morphing in size and moving. Jumpscares felt cheap to me and the movie didn’t rely on genuine fear for me enough.

I love anything horror/thriller, but this just wasn’t it for me. I’m shocked at the great reviews and general consensus in this thread. But I think this is one of the worst movies I’ve seen in the last few years. Sorry if that’s harsh or gets me downvoted into oblivion but love to see that others liked it! Great to be in theaters. I also think my theater didn’t like it, because multiple people laughed when it ended.",vjd5ge
idro6qg,"I honestly don't understand how this movie has 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was one of the most bland horror movies I've ever seen. Protagonist, Killer, Killer kills Protagonist's friends, Killer kidnaps Protagonist, Protagonist kills Killer and escapes. The End. No big reveal or twist. Just movie over. The people who liked this movie must have left the theater drooling, because there was absolutely zero thinking required. All the ""clues"" were spoon-fed to you for 90 minutes.  


The movie also had ZERO depth to it. No backstory, no context - literally the only details you are given are what you see on the screen. The sister had magic dream powers that were never really explained, other than her mother also had them? And her mother was in the movie for - \*checks notes\* - oh wait, she wasn't in the movie. The Grabber had zero backstory. As far as the audience knows, he's just a crazy magician who kidnaps and kills kids? No idea as to why? And one of biggest problems I have - MAX! He figures out his brother is the killer inside the house he's staying at, which is a pretty big plot point in the move - YET HIS CHARACTER IS ONLY IN TWO SCENES!!! HOW???  


Mind-boggling to me how this movie is getting such good reviews.",vjd5ge

ikbanho,"Man I really liked this movie. And like everyone else is saying, I thought the actress playing the sister was PHENOMENAL. She really brought it. 

Wished they had given us more about the Grabber, though. The movie hints at childhood abuse but just doesn't explain further, and I wish it did. Especially since his brother is a character, too. And there seems to be a lot to be said about Finn being able to withstand abuse but not stand up for himself. 

At only an hour 45 I think they had the space to flesh out that backstory",vjd5ge

idj0zr8,"I wasn't blown away by it the way the critics seem to be. I thought it needed more depth and an expanded B plot. I needed about 30 minutes more focusing on the sister, cops, and the crack addict brother trying to find the kidnapper under his own nose. That aspect of the story was woefully underdeveloped. 

Also am I the only one who thought it was funny he made a phone receiver his weapon of choice when he had a porcelain toilet lid at his disposal?",vjd5ge
idr2zyp,"So, uh, the kid gets away from Ethan Hawke and the ""happy"" ending has him going back into a clearly very abusive household.",vjd5ge
idk4ykq,"I am REALLY surprised by the extent of positive feedback on this one.

The dad is a really hastily put together character, classic abusive archetype but he seems to exist to blurt out exposition related to the girl. I guess he's also there to compare to The Grabber (weak as hell name!) with the belt but it comes across kinda weak.

The girl's delivery of dialogue is so strange, she feels like an adult-written child with the zesty profanity. The main boy is *fine* if a bit boring, but Hawke himself never struck me as creepy. If anything that mask hurts, there's no facial expression and it comes across as, for lack of better phrase, trying too hard.

The editing of this is really strange. There's a lot of oddly hard cuts, little bits that feel out of place between scenes. The tension of the main character is constantly undercut by the stuff with the girl, which feels largely meaningless; either make this about the boy, or about the girl, but the combo does not work together. Hell, the girl doesn't really DO anything of impact! Yeah the cops get there by the end to find the houses but it has no bearing on the boy's character or his development. 

I think I'd prefer a story about the dream girl because the main kid just doesn't do it for me plot wise. The flashbacks to the other kids start getting a little tiring, and he pivots so quickly to and from ingenuity to blubbering child that it does come across a teence fake. Harsh as it is in terms of realism, even that last kill feels underwhelming. 

Side note, feels a little odd that he abandoned the window so easily unless I missed something visually.",vjd5ge
idk8xav,"Pretty good movie, but what the fuck was that last scene? „“Call me Finn“ would have been cringe in a coming of age-movie but here it sounded like the writer lost a bet.",vjd5ge
idprp74,"I wanted to love this movie so much but God it was so bad. Absolutely nothing was earned. Cops couldn't get a lead without the little girl spoon feeding them every piece of information. The little girl magically has real world accurate dreams. And once the kid is in the room instead of making him think on his own to figure his way out,  he gets every piece of information he needs to escape just given to him on a silver platter by his ghost friends. WTF. He didn't earn his freedom. Such lazy writing. The characters were just passive and did absolutely nothing to help themselves. 

Ethan Hawke was great but not in enough scenes. He never went over the rules with the kid. What was his motive? I got rapey vibes from him. They mentioned he hears the phone ringing too and thought it was going to lead to something but it never did. His brother is just visiting but going all Carrie from Homeland, was so cringe.

The paranormal aspect of the movie became a crutch for bad writing. It would have been 100x better if they kept it grounded.",vjd5ge
idj2u02,"Got to see it back at the Tribeca Film Festival. I thought it was decent and enjoyable.

I really like the overall creepy atmosphere and the tension throughout. The performances from both Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames were pretty great and anytime the two are together, it adds a lot to the thrills. I love Hawke and I never thought Hawke would work as a villain, I was wrong cause Hawke killed it as a creepy sadistic person. The production and environment help to create the time period of the 70s as it did remind me of the original Halloween movie a little. The soundtrack and costumes are also really good and fit appropriately.

I do think the story is interesting but because it was based on a short story, I felt like it wasn't well explored and it was pretty predictable. I tried to avoid all trailers for this movie but even that, I was still a little let down by the story. I honestly wished it had expanded the concept and explored a little more.

To my surprise, I thought some of the supporting actors were kind of bad. Especially some of the child actors of the bullies and some of the ghost victims. It could just be me but I felt like their performances were beyond their depth and given the dialogues they were speaking, it felt a little cringe-worthy as it’s like an adult thinks children speak that way. The cliche jump scare tropes did bug me a little and I really really didn't like the father character as he is annoying and kind of punchable.

Despite my personal gripes with this movie, I still had a fun time with it. It’s a flawed but fun horror movie and I do recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. Dig that mask tho.

Did anyone get a vibe of Stephen King’s IT when the Sister wore a Yellow Raincoat while she rode her bike down the streets and gets jumped scared by the dead bodies when it was raining? Then I remembered the original story was from Joe Hill who is the son of Stephen King.",vjd5ge
idqytbi,"Kind of surprised to see how much love this movie is getting. I didn't think it was bad, but I felt like it was pretty mediocre. The jump scares were fucking stupid and unnecessary.

Overall felt like it didn't live up to its potential.",vjd5ge

these kids are borderline murdering each other for some reason? 

the ghosts on the black phone never really help for some reason? they kinda just drop vague hints? 

dad is a mega asshole and serves no repercussions?

What in the hell is wrong with people's scores??? I mean, yeah it was pretty enjoyable...some of the characters were pretty cool...but this movie is at like 90% on there??  Honestly...it's a sloppy mess of a story if you ask me.  

It's a period piece, then it's got the whole supernatural little girl slid in there...but it's a real world legit stalker ass kid snatcher that somehow can go around and get helium filled black balloons in an all black creeper van snatching up kids in broad daylight - but still.  Now he's also got two houses on a part time magician salary...then we've got it with like just 5% of a cop investigation movie, but honestly two of the most ineffective detectives alive.  Then it's like 50% communication with the dead somehow magically through a phone with a kid exhibiting NO other super natural tendencies whatsoever despite having a mother and a daughter with exactly that.  Which the entire daughter part is in there to literally give us NOTHING other than the cops finding the OTHER house about 10 minutes earlier than they would have had she not even existed at all.  

Just sloppy jalopy ass writing of a story.  Netflix release I'd give it the home streaming bump to maybe a 7.0/10.  As-is, headed to a theater to see it instead of Elvis or Top Gun for a 2nd time???  6.1/10 absolute max. MFers throwing 90% on Rotten Tomatoes should be ashamed.",vjd5ge

Also, what was up with the three nerdiest bullies IN THE HSTORY OF CINEMA--where on earth did they find those pasty dweebs, BattleBots??? And the way Finney was COWERING in the bathroom stall from them??? Please!

Also, something was off about the kids--they were too old and athletic for most child abduction killers to bother with. True crime abduction killers generally go for the weaker victims that won't put up as much of a fight. Bruce, the first in-film victim, could have almost passed for a grown man!",vjd5ge

When Finney escapes and yells, why the hell wouldn't people be rushing out and calling the cops in a town where five kids have been taken?  Where are they when Hawke has him on the ground?  This is one of those scenes where the makers don't even show the resolution (him shoving the kid back in the van) because it defies credibility too much.

So I guess when you get the shit kicked out of you and a bloody face, you just are able to wash it off and go to school like it never happened (both the boy and girl)?

idy8iw8,This movie was beyond boring.,vjd5ge
ie0ymlh,"I did not enjoy this one. The acting is awful for the most part, where most roles are played by children who are giving Disney Channel-tier performances.

The lead is the best of the bunch thankfully, but his performance has a singular emotion throughout. His kid sister character is a terrible performance except in the darkest scene in the film, found in the first act and divorced from the narrative of the story. The film is mostly grounded, but has two supernatural plot elements which are only ever explored to conveniently solve narrative threads which could’ve been solved without these aspects.

The film thankfully isn’t drenched in terrible special effects like some other horror films nowadays, but the third act has a hilariously bad effect in a key moment, and moments of annoying editing (cuts during zooms) when the rest of the film is edited well enough. The horror aspects boil down to a couple of jumpscares which I’m not a fan of, as the atmospherical horror is ruined by bad acting.

Ethan Hawke has a decent performance in theory, but the execution is very goofy with his higher pitch voice and nonthreatening actions after the initial incident. The background eventually explored for this villain character doesn’t make sense, and with a town in panic, even the initial incident doesn’t make sense.

The film is decently shot but the colors are drained for a very drab and bland visual style. The best aspects are the brief moments of honest 70s childhood hardship (beyond the extremely stock bully moments), and one electronic track that appears in the third act which sounded similair to the amazing Boss Music from Dig Dug Arrangement. I don’t remember the rest of the score at all.

I kind of see a little resemblance of young Ethan hawks in Mason Thames….especially the eyes.

Is there any back story about the masks? He seems to change up the mask and even seem to wear a different hairstyle when he wears different mask. Some times he wears the full mask, some times half, one mask seems to show a smile, one with teeth,….etc. 

In the original story, is there more backstory about the grabber? I wish there is and they can make an anthology of this character. 

I am wondering did the grabber just snapped and started killing kids, it seems that, in the movie, he started kidnapping and killing these kids rather quickly one after another. He didn’t seem to have a end game or long term plan too. Did he just snapped. And why did he need to have his face covered, or half covered with the mask? 

I am guessing the grabber was beaten by his parents? I am guessing that’s why there is the reference to the belt and naughty kid game…..?  

It does seem that he grabber hides his upper face when he wants to be violent? And hides his lower half of the face when he is friendlier to the victim? Is there a pattern to this, or just random coincidence? Was it intentional that he wore the upper half of the horned mask when he wanted to kill? Or it was just whatever that was available as he was in a rush to stop his brother?",vjd5ge

There really never felt like a point where he was in danger to me because there were two major plot lines focusing on getting him out.  So, either the sisters telepathy wasn’t necessary or the ghost voices weren’t necessary.

I liked the cinematography and production design quite a bit as well as the music,  but the script really lacked something in my opinion.

Hawkes villain was excellent but underused like many are saying.",vjd5ge

Hardly any answers with a sub plot about his sisters having dreams, which I thought was going to be how they save Finn…boy was I wrong.

Because that was not the right answer lol So many questions left unanswered, so many pointless plot points and idiotic moments. This could’ve been a 30 minute/ 1 tv episode lol. Probably better for something like American horror stories where they have a random horror story each episode. This was very disappointing.

ihy5b5p,"I know I’m late but anyway, I’ve just it.
And I absolutely loved it, I really enjoyed all its moments! The fun atmosphere of the seventies, fashion clothes and so on.

Mystery about everything, up to half of the movie and many theories and explanations are still possible, we will not know that the killer owned two houses and Fini's sister was watching the other house until the end of the movie.

Finney’s relationship with her father, the scene of her father beating her and her reaction was epic.

The strange dreams she has, their connection with ghosts and seeing what reveals the mystery. And also of course, “Jesus, what the fuck?”

Her relationship with her brother was very touching, I definitely loved her personality.

And all the kidnapped children, I felt sympathy for them, I really suffered the death of Bruce and Robin! I was also saddened by Max’s death.

Production, photography, sound effects, colors and music, it was all dazzling, the movie definitely gives you a good dose of adrenaline, I want to see more of it!

I agree with what I read from one of the viewers, where he could hear the phone because he has powers of some kind like his sister.

As for the kidneaker, I have some theories about him. I think he suffered something similar, maybe he was locked up in the basement when punished by his father, or beaten with the same belt. And maybe he killed his father too.

At first when he said, ""I also heard the phone ring, and no one answered,"" I thought he was also kidnapped in this place. Maybe that’s a possibility.

And a scene of panic when you take off the mask, I would like to know why! 
Has he used masks since childhood? Or is it a way he followed after he started kidnapping the children to escape himself?

Or maybe for give him a chance to reincarcate other characters? 

I will be happy or a movie about 
his past has been written! I think I'm going to look for the writer Joe Hill more, who by the way is Stephen King's son.

But then, when the supernatural involvement with the kids began, it really sort of became unbalanced. The Grabber really doesn’t notice when Finney is able to tear the bars off the top window, after the fact? He lets the kid do anything he wants down there, doesn’t monitor a thing. Seems really a dumbing down of the villain and just removed a lot of the realism from the film. Almost felt like The Grabber was barely a threat in the 2nd half of the film and it lost a lot of its fear factor and sense of menace. Having said that, the young actress who played Gwen was incredible and she has a very bright future ahead of her.

All in all, a decent horror flick but feels like it could have been much better.",vjd5ge

Robin made me feel like I was watching a karate kid movie, the sister and her psychic powers (along with her mom) didn't make much sense or had any real purpose, and I feel like we could have had more interactions between the MC, the villain, and the other missing boys.

idj520y,Tbh I didn’t really care for it. The sisters dialogue was so corny. The drunk dad was a lame character. The movie resolved too quickly. No character stood out. The plot as a whole and some of the actors were good though,vjd5ge
idqfhcg,"I feel like we are in a time and age where everything that's different and doesn’t follow a generic movie scheme automatically gets praised to the maximum. I just left the theater and I’m really confused about all the high praises giving this movie a 8/9/10 rating. This movie is a solid 6 in my opinion. I felt it didn’t have me at the edge of my seat, the plot was pretty straight forward, no big twists or turns I didn’t see coming and it wasn’t horror to me. 2-3 jump scares don’t justify this being called horror. It’s a thriller. A good one time watch thriller, but a bad horror movie, if that’s what you want to label it. The plot development was pretty foreseeable and the movie really was missing a backstory and explanation. I felt like I left unsatisfied and wanting more out of everybody’s characters. You just get thrown into the movie and the town and certain habits of people and they expect you to just accept it without any explanation. This movie was a solid 6 but that’s about it to me. Sorry…",vjd5ge
igvccip,This movie was fucking garbage how does this poll reflect anything wtf.,vjd5ge
idril2i,"How did the phone judge what dead kid got to call? I thought they were going in order but Bruce and Robin were the first and last to call.

Gwen saw the van in one of her dreams and didn't even mention this to the police before the other dream showed her the house.

Was the Grabber's brother necessary? Like, when the Grabber was waiting to hit Finney with the belt, if Finney had screamed wouldn't Max have heard?

Were the masks necessary? Yeah, they're creepy, but they don't add anything and Hawke was already terrifying with his limited screentime. 6/10",vjd5ge
ids7fu9,"I had read the ten page short story last night, so I had it fresh in my mind while watching. I think for the most part Scott Derrickson did a solid job of expanding upon it, though there were a few additions and minor changes that didn't completely work for me, but not enough to take me out of the film while watching. 

First the positives---

I loved the relationship between Finney and Gwen, and I'm glad they gave Gwen more to do, plus McGraw was just incredible in the role and owned every scene she was in. Thames was also strong as Finney, but McGraw really stole the film for me. Really all the child actors  were superb, and those fight scenes were fucking brutal.  I also like how they inserted and styled the dream/vision sequences. They were reminiscent of the tapes in Sinister without ripping them off entirely, the music really heightened those scenes. 

Hawke, while with less screen time than I expected, still gave probably the creepiest performance of his career. He was absolutely unrecognizable, and not just because of the masks-- which were creepy in their own right. But his body language, physical appearance, and even his voice  kept having me question if it was even him. Even my mom asked 'isn't Ethan Hawke in this?' after he had already been on screen. Plus some shots he'd look tooth pick thin, and then when he's shirtless in the kitchen looked buffer/thicker. It was really messing with me. 

I liked how the jump scares were used rather sparingly (I can only recall about 3, or 4 if you include the ax scene), there are long stretches that were pretty quiet, so when they did happen they were truly effective. There's nothing hear that jolted me quite like that damn lawnmower in Sinister, but each one definitely gave me a jolt. 

One thing that kind of diminished the scare factor of Sinister for me was when all the ghostly kids started popping up, but here Derrickson really got it spot on. I don't know if it was better makeup, the way they'd be framed in the shot, the implications/context of their fates, but when they appeared it was hugely effective and got under my skin. Plus the way they'd appear but Finney couldn't actually see them was a nice touch. In the book there aren't any ghostly children, only their voices are heard on the phone, so I really liked how they translated that to the screen. 

Finney beating The Grabber in the phone was great, in the story he simply beats him and strangles him, with the last line being 'It's for you'. But I loved how they depicted his friend 'training him', and Finney setting up the trap for The Grabber to fall into was a nice touch and added to the impact of the scene. 

Other positives--- I like how they took their time to develop the kids before their disappearances, made what happened to them far more tragic later on, something that wasn't really explored much in the book at all. And that most of them had Finney's back, or they were friendly even if he wasn't close with all of them. Every fade to black when the van appeared also creeped me out, gave me Mindhunter vibes. Finally, the set design, sound, costumes, period detail, editing, cinematography, and especially Mark Korven's original score was great. I loved how propulsive and off-kilter it was, it really elevated the sequences that it played during, much like the music used in Sinister (if not as blood chilling). 

NOW SOME ISSUES-- I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS SHORT AS THIS IS ALREADY TOO LONG.

\- The scenes with the father could have been cut down, some even excised, and his character doesn't really add anything to the story, other than he's an abusive/alcoholic cliche. But it doesn't really go anywhere. Plus it's briefly mentioned that the mom also had 'visions' but nothing was done with it, again it didn't really add anything. And I get it, he drinks a lot etc, but there's not ONE scene where we see him even caring or trying to find his son whatsoever, he just gets mad when his daughter actually does. It just all felt so thin, and then when he apologizes to them it's like 'okay...'. I get it's showing the siblings bond is strong because of what they deal/have dealt with. But it just kind of dragged the story out. 

\- While Hawke is creepy, we never really see him doing anything to really threaten or even attack Finney. Sure he watches him while he sleeps, he says creepy shit, but I felt like there was a missed opportunity here? I know he kidnaps him and holds him captive, but he only really gets violent at the very end, or when Finney briefly escapes and he puts the knife to his neck. Otherwise he just occasionally pops up, acts weird, brings food, and then just sleeps in the kitchen. Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way, but I just think they could have taken it a bit further. Plus about 90% of his dialogue/scenes are exactly as they are in the story, pretty much verbatim. Would have liked more of him and less of the dad. 

\- Finally, while never boring, the film got a bit repetitive at times, and it hindered the pacing for me. Some of it just felt like they needed to pad it out to get a long enough run time, or just ran out of ideas at points. They could have even thrown in a few more legit scares. This is also a 'one and done' movie for me, I don't really think I ever need to rewatch it. It's straight forward and too the point, fun/tense in the moment, but it's not like repeated viewings would reveal anything new or be that rewarding. What you see is what you get, and while it's certainly well-made, there are no truly STANDOUT sequences that I'd need to see again. 

Also the two houses 'twist' just didn't work for me at all and I didn't really see any point to it. They could have just added another basement in the house and call it good. I don't see the reasoning in including that in the first place. 

WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID. Do I think it's worth seeing? Yes. Could I have waited to watch it at home on VOD? Probably. Does it do well at expanding the short--bare bones-- story it's based on? For the most part. But I'd still put it below Emily Rose (still my favorite Derrickson film) and Sinister, even if I have some major issues with that one, it still has such an oppressive atmosphere that really works its way under your skin and sticks with you, with some of the best scares and visuals and sound in modern horror. The Black Phone gets the job done, but it's more of a low-key thriller with not that many surprises, but it still gets the job done for a moderately creepy night out, and again, the performances and style are all great. But with a few tweaks it could have been so much more, it  just lacks a certain intensity while still keeping you involved. 

3.5/5 for me. 

TL;DR- Expands upon the short story in ways both great and others that aren't quite as successful. Great performances by the cast, even if Hawke isn't utilized quite as much. More low-key creepy than outright scary or frequently intense. Still really well-made, stylish, involving while it lasts and worth watching, if not quite outright terrifying as it could have been or wholly memorable in the long run. It won't be keeping you up at night, and honestly you'd lose none of the impact if you just wait and watch it at home with the lights off. 3.5/5.",vjd5ge
idq2eyr,"Anyone else feel like the ending came fairly... easily? Like I get that the kid used all of the exit plans at once but his ultimate plan boiled down to *hitting the grabber in the head real hard* and then it just... worked, instantly

I feel like Split did a more convincing job conveying the same kind of arc from the main character",vjd5ge
ididwik,"I know it's just a movie, but stick to one fucking exit plan Finney",vjd5ge
idl26sb,"Saw this at an advance preview last week, and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie so much yet was so frustrated and conflicted about what it could have been. It looks great, the acting is stellar all around (barring James ransome who I like but plays the same guy in everything) and it was creepy (ethan hawke sat in his underwear and a mask holding a belt... nightmare fuel).

But this movie ends so abruptly and with such ease. Its just sort of over. No big reveals, no explanations for what the black phone is, why it works, why the grabber does what he does, etc. Ambiguity is fine but I was under the false impression this entire movie that some big reveals were coming. Was the sister channeling the kids spirits into the phone? Why did the grabber lie and say he didn't kidnap all the other kids at the start? Why does the movie treat it as some big reveal that he buried the bodies across the street, who cares? How did his brother not figure anything out until the very end? Where did he get those incredible masks and why does he wear them? What even was ""naughty boy""? Was he actually a magician? I wish we could have seen him in his actual occupation at some point.

My other big and weird issue with it was that there are SO many aspects of this film that, if you remove them, don't change the film whatsoever. If his sister didn't have the prophetic dreams, NOTHING changes. He'd still have escaped at the end. She didn't actually help at all, Finney escaped 100% by his own volition (which is cool but why have the sister plot?). The Grabbers brother was taxing comic relief and added nothing other than a predictable gory death. The abusive dad; yes, child abuse is a big theme, and maybe that's what made Finney different and able to escape, his abusive past giving him strength. But still, remove the abusive dad and nothing plot wise really changes. I forgive this aspect though because the abuse felt real and not just like exploitative shock value.

Also the father's switch from savagely beating his daughter over her dreams, to humouring her about them and driving around the neighborhood, felt slightly jarring and unearned.

This movie felt like an exceptional straight to netflix thriller, not the movie theatre horror classic a lot of the (I suspect fake) reviews imply it to be. I still enjoyed it, and I'd see it again. But I expected more. Interested to hear other people's thoughts.",vjd5ge
ie9z0z6,"Your arms mint, you almost had me",vjd5ge
idlaiqo,"Kind of underwhelming overall.  It's a compelling setup, there are some funny lines (Gwen swearing at the cops was pretty good) and decent scares (when one of the kids appears behind Finney while he's on the phone, it got a big reaction out of my audience).  I also really dug the suspense in the scene where Finney is trying to escape while the Grabber is sleeping.  The way the Grabber kept fading in and out of focus was a great touch.

Even so, all of the most interesting parts of the movie (the supernatural element, the Grabber himself) feel very underexplored.  It's also very tame for an R, with the exception of one death towards the end.  This could (almost) have been a PG-13 if they had cut a few F bombs, and I'm surprised they didn't go for that given the young cast and the greater returns they probably would have seen.",vjd5ge

And the characters are so damn lovable (with the exception of The Grabber, of course.) “What the heck, Jesus?” is just one of the lines that will stick with you forever. Madeleine McGraw as Gwen - what an incredible performance. So much life in that character. I read some of 20th Century Ghosts before seeing the film so I somewhat spoiled part of the ending for myself. Just thought this was extremely well done.",vjd5ge

ido6vd1,"I really enjoyed the film but what I found unbelievable was the brother not noticing it happening around him. I get that he's suppose to be an idiot, but he said he was between jobs and probably didn't have much to do during the day. Is he going to go in the kitchen to make lunch and see his brother shirtless with his creepy mask guarding the basement and not think anything of it? ""Hey bro just making a sandwich. Being a real freak today, huh?""",vjd5ge
idufll9,"This is one of those movies where the premise was better than the actual execution. A boy getting kidnapped and relying on a mysterious phone that lets the dead give him hints on how to escape while his sister has prophetic dreams about the kidnapper? That is original af and something I would love to see more of.

I guess I was hoping that the phone calls and the prophetic dreams Gwen was having would be two halves of a whole and combine to give the full picture and have equally important roles on Finney escaping.

However, by the time Gwen realises where he is and alerts the authorities, Finney has already managed to escape, so what was even the point? It would have played out the same either way.

It's also a very straightforward film without much depth to its plot or characters so there's nothing to really take away when all is said and done.",vjd5ge

iev4q2l,"What was even the point of the girl having the dreams if the kid was just gonna escape on his own?

The brother’s been trying to solve the case and narrows down where the killer lives, he knows his brother doesn’t want him going down to the basement yet he never suspects him, then suddenly he figures it out by just staring at the same map he’s been staring at for months now?

Also, the fucking van was parked right there for everybody to see and the police never bothered to search there?

And the killer loses his mask and all of a sudden he’s helpless?

The whole movie seemed kinda dumb

Edit: oh I remembered another thing that bothered me, the sister threw a giant rock at one of the bullies and had blood squirting out of his head and NOTHING happened?? No consequences for that shit?",vjd5ge

idtej4d,"Anyone got any theories on the pulsating phone? it’s been bothering me trying to figure it out since I saw it. My best theory is that maybe none of that was “real” after all.. whether it was the drugs the grabber gave him, or just his “imagination” (some sort of schizophrenia in his family). Sometimes when you stare at things too long they move that way and things start to look and feel weird. Maybe that was just the visual way to ground it in reality? The mind can do some crazy things under extreme duress fighting for survival.",vjd5ge
idusb3a,It's funny I totally bought the fact that Finney could talk to ghosts but I thought it was a crock of shit that Gwen could see visions in her dreams. Either way I had a fun time with this movie not as scary as Sinister was but it was really solid.,vjd5ge

igd9q75,"Like everyone else, I have to call bullshit on that failed escape scene. Finney runs down the sidewall into the van's path lol. Any person, kid or adult, would run somewhere the van couldn't follow. Like into a backyard, over a fence, through trees, anything. But nope, he sticks to the street where he can't hide or outrun the Grabber. Good movie, but I rolled my eyes at that part.",vjd5ge
igdcls2,"Yeah, this film has a big plot hole.

The Grabber's brother Max is super invested in finding out who the killer is, but doesn't find it the least bit odd his brother padlocked the door to keep people from leaving. I mean, he himself would have to use the combination to leave the house.

And I guess Max was asleep when the Grabber was walking around the house in his mask? The whole thing is oddly written. In fact, Max existing in the story at all causes it problems.

I'll say this was a great movie that downgraded itself to a good movie.",vjd5ge

All the kid actors were great. The main kid and his sister, as well as all the supporting kids.

I really liked the 70's vibe... they did that well.

Very cool how all the different tips from the dead kids came together at the end to help Finney kill The Grabber. Including the steak from the freezer to distract the dog.

Only real gripe was the brother getting killed before the finale, which took me out of it a bit.

Also On the Run by Pink Floyd was used awesomely for the climax.",vjd5ge

ihm8jya,"Interesting that people question the circumstances. I found this movie really disturbing on a personal level. I was in grade 4 in 1974. All the latchkey kids in my neighborhood hung out with Bob, the friendly city bus driver. He had a wife, a toddler, and a baby. He was so friendly. He took the kids for bus rides. He played with the kids in the pool. He was so friendly, he really loved kuds. One day an older boy rode his bicycle to the playground and asked us all  if Bob had been ""funny"" with us. ""Yes"", I said. Bob was convicted on 18 counts of child molesting, including sodomy. Kids were educated about stranger danger, not friend danger. Kids were told not to fight in case it got worse. Kids were told to be seen and not heard. Kids weren't told about the no-no zone, hell, we didn't have basic sex Ed, other than woods porn mags. And finally, kids were told to respect adults. 

So if anybody wonders about the circumstances in the film, I can assure you, this shit happened. ALL THE TIME.",vjd5ge

ile5xl2,"I understand that this might have messed up the movie's genre but I wish it had more of an emotional effect on the audience. I really wish that the tragedy of the entire thing was played up more. I think it would've been great to see the ghosts be more upset and angry with the whole situation, similarly to what happened when Vance's ghost kinda flew backwards and the bottles started to break but with varrying degrees of hopelessness, sadness, and rage (and not as overdone and flat). The ghosts just didn't really seem to...care that much. I do understand that the actors are younger so I won't be too harsh on their skills, but I feel that the script could have been better in this regard. However, it would have been a risky move. The idea of preteen-teenage boys getting kidnapped and killed is already very dark, so emphasizing the horror they endured could have caused the audience to not be able to stomache the movie and therefore not like it. I feel that this is a risk they should have taken though. This is just my opinion though.

Edit: For those of you who have said that you wished The Grabber was more fleshed out, I understand but I feel that this wasn't necessary. I actually really liked the fact that they didn't focus on him so much and instead focused on the current victim and past victims. It's a nice change.

Ethan Hawke with his masks either resembles Danny Elfman as Satan or Bruce Campbell after he's been partway sucked into the Necronomicon. It wasn't as deep or memorable as it wants to be, but it's a pretty solid '70s period horror film.

This character, after the scrap, carves the address number of a house on this dude's arm, that we later find out to be the house where ""The Grabber's"" victims are buried down in the basement. Later on in the scene, we also see that police drop him off in front of that same house as he shouts his most used line ""Today's the day mother******!!!"" as he kicks open the front gate.

What is the significance of these details to the overall plot of the movie? I feel like I missed an important reveal besides the fact that the sister of the main character, Gwen, now has a clear picture of what she's looking for.

This doubles down in the follow up scene where Vance and Finney are talking in the room as his ghost appears on the other side of the bed... At the end of their conversation, Vance's ghost gets aggressively spirited away as the black phone gives off some kind of intense energy.

When warned about using the padlock, or the part where he's told that the beatings with the belt were part of the treatment, were indicators that this was happening at Finns house, and that his dad was doing the crimes. And the whole 'defend yourself' thing was Finns reckoning to finally get back at his dad for all the abuse.

ikeez3y,"I’ve watched it 3 times. I obviously think it’s great…

1. The actress who plays the sister is phenomenal. The scene where she was getting beat by her father, she completely sold it.

2. I loved how EH portrayed The Grabber. I enjoyed the nuances of his voice, odd mannerisms and his giggles that borderlines on childish and creepy. I unashamedly admit that EH looked sexy as hell in the shirtless scene waiting for Finney to come upstairs with the belt. 😆

3. One thing that bothered me is how the community dealt with missing kids. Is that how it was in the 70’s where they don’t enforce a curfew & other protocol in that type of situation? It was concerning to see that parents and the school would allow kids to continue to go off by themselves. I know most of the kids shown were ruffians but still. 

4. I didn’t expect a long drawn out backstory about The Grabber but it would’ve been nice to know how long he has been doing it and if he moved from another town where there were missing kids. It also would’ve been nice to see him living a regular life with a job and such to see how he affords both houses but I guess we would’ve lost the mystery of who The Grabber was and we would be teetering onto The Lovely Bones territory.",vjd5ge

Ethan Hawke clearly has a thing for playing crazy characters after this and moon knight. I’m so glad the little sister wasn’t stupid and didn’t go to the house alone. This movie had some really competent characters which is rare. I also feel for the dad, he was clearly a broken man but his kids still loved and respected him.

The whole cast ruled, I like how the plan unfolded, the soundtrack (while sparse) was really effective, and I could totally see myself rewatching this. Good time.",vjd5ge

 I was so hyped for this because I loved Sinister (one of my favorite horror movies, and probably my favorite theatre experience.) so I was obviously hyped to see Scott Derrickson work with Ethan Hawke & James Ransone in another pop-horror. It wasn't as 'pop-horror' or as scary as I wanted it to be, but it was still a good ass movie. Good plot, good characters, solid ending.

ie0x2e5,"Now, it’s clear that Gwen has supernatural power, I mean Finley doesn’t seem to have those dreams, yet Finney could hear the phone. So does that mean Finney also have some of that supernatural power? How about the grabber, why is he able to hear the phone? One can say that Finney inherited that power from his mother just like his sister did, but where did grabber got that power? So maybe the children that the grabber killed tried to contact  Finney and the grabber and that’s why they can hear the phone. But why did the grabber hear the phone when he was a child, before he started the killing? So who was trying to contact the grabber back then?",vjd5ge

I would have liked to have known more about the killer and his motivation instead. The main kid was fine. They could have done more in the first act to make him more likeable. 

The things I did like were the atmosphere and the score. It made it somewhat suspenseful even though I didn't find the killer that scary and wasn't that invested in the kids fate. The supernatural stuff was quite interesting as well once I figured out what was happening. 6/10.",vjd5ge
ieajtq1,I’m sorry but was Max staying in the same house as Finn or was he in the other one?

ien4z3f,"Did anybody think that the part of the film where the father beat his children was a little excessive and that it set up the climax of of the film to be Finn standing up to his abusive father (who he never end ups standing up to) instead of the grabber.  I was shocked that the father wasnt killed on screen sometime in the film after he was shown beating kids like that.

I also thought that when the grabber turned out to have a persona where he wanted to act as an abusive father and beat finn with same weapon that finns father used on his children, that the whole concept of the grabber was going to turn out to be in the mind of finn as a coping mechanism shielding him from the truth that his real father was beating the mess out of him.  I was almost a little disappointed that they made these links between the father and the grabber so obvious but the links seem to explain something that turned out not to be true.",vjd5ge

if6ko3p,"I went to see it blind, loved it. I think it was really refreshing to see a simple thriller that didn't try to pad out a 2+ hour run time with spoon fed backstory. Of course I found myself wondering why the Grabber did what he did, but I don't think the movie suffered from lack of a ham-fisted flashback about the Grabber's backstory or a monologue about the origin of Gwen's psychic powers or where the ghost kids were. They utilized the basement setting really well, I was on edge constantly and never got bored. I really liked the editing, especially in Gwen's dreams, and the soundtrack was bangin'. The atmosphere in general was so good, I felt tense the entire time.

In regards to the Grabber, as soon as I noticed the mask/behavior changes I assumed I was in for the ""murderer with DID"" trope yet again. I also remember him saying that he didn't kill the children, it was someone else, but I could have misunderstood. I think they were going for ""multiple personalities"", but I personally interpreted it as him possibly portraying characters from his past. Like the Grabber in the kitchen with the belt could have represented an abusive father, while the Grabber who watched the boy could have represented an enabling mother or even his brother. I'll have to watch it again and focus on the differences between the masks. 

I wish the theme of child abuse could have been fleshed out a bit more. I feel like the Dad/Gwen scenes in the beginning were almost meant to mirror the Grabber/Finney scenes later on, or at least hammer in the ""naughty boy"" game being based off of the Grabber's abuse. The Grabber and Finney are like two sides of the same coin. Where the Grabber perpetuated the cycle of abuse, Finney ended it. I hope that Finney can have a good life after this, and that he doesn't end up going down the same path as his kidnapper.

I like the theory that the three main characters are Shiners because that was my thought too! I think the idea of stories taking place in the universe of The Shining about other Shiners is a cool concept, even if it's not canon. I didn't really find myself wondering about their powers, mostly because it wasn't made out out to be a big deal, which is neat.

Overall, I was really impressed. Some of the child acting felt a bit stiff, particularly Robin and Finney's bathroom convo in the beginning, but he really shined during his phone call, it got me feeling really emotional. I can't think of any real complaints I had. I'm really glad I went to see it in theatres. A bit off topic, but lots of the trailers for upcoming horror movies caught my interest. Horror has been getting better and better lately, I can't wait to see more. :)",vjd5ge
iffij8r,"Any thoughts on the symbolism of blood throughout the movie? The opening credits, the movie Finney is watching while eating ice cream and the bathtub of blood, Robin's fight, the gash on the Grabber's arm when Finney was abducted, the bodies of the dead kids. The red blood was such a stark contrast to the greyish, bland colour palette of the scenes.",vjd5ge

ifov23p,"I didn’t like it that much, comparing it to sinister, his other film, it felt lack luster like they had all these super cool plot points and couldn’t just decide on one. The devil masks could’ve had much more potential, a history behind them or linked to the grabbers past in some way…the brother/younger sister could’ve been on his trail more to add suspense and push forward the plot of how close or far away he was to murdering the kid. Even the kids as ghosts weren’t very scary, just loud.
I think it was very mid level like teenage horror, it didn’t do much on gore and the jump scares were so tame to what I was expecting, especially because it ended very happily with the kids new found confidence? The abusive dad was also just forgiven? He just goes to school like normal not suffering from insane PTSD? It ended like a campy marvel movie imo…I’m also not a big fan of the happy ending stuff but that’s just me",vjd5ge
ifvw0di,"What a refreshing change from the boring drivel that often passes for horror these days. It would have stood out simply for delivering a coherent, suspenseful plot set in a believable frightening time and place.

igdb8ft,"This movie has a lot of good things in it, but doesn’t know how to use them. 

You could have the movie framed from the POV of the “seer” sister and be about growing stronger and creating a good relationship with her alcoholic parent trying to save her brother with her “powers” , few flashes to the kidnapping to build the narrative.

You could’ve a “Split”-like narrative mostly from the main kid perspective, which is what this movie is interested anyway, learning to fight back, etc..

But both of them running side by side just made it worse than it could be, killed the tension and led to many elements that went nowhere.

 Also… the two houses one in front of the other fake out would’ve been used way better when he ran away the first time… the kid running out of a house just to be received by Ethan Hawke in the other. 

Anyway, it’s a good supernatural horror movie and the villain design is really cool.",vjd5ge

When he actually *sees* a ghost for the first time, he looks at that floating neck slit girl and doesn’t blink. When she points, he’s just like…mmmkay, and looks away.

igmi901,"I thought this movie was pretty great, and it definitely has a leg up on recently released horror/thrillers *cough* men *cough* the devil made me do it *cough* and it has a killer soundtrack to tie the near-dystopian 70’s atmosphere together. 

there’s something I wanna bring up however and that is the symbolism in the mask. it’s a pretty common trope for masks in stories to bestow a sense of “justice” in the wearer as they carry out horrible acts of violence, such as in lord of the flies. we have proof of this symbolism being used in TBM when Finney ripped off the grabber’s mask during the fight scene. the grabber looked utterly defeated and disappointed in himself, and we may infer that, psychologically, he “becomes the grabber” only when he wears this mask. This is also why when he was staring at Finney while he slept he didn’t take it off and instead we learned it’s a two-piece mask, the upper portion removed for visibility. 

what I am confused about is how he was able to abduct Finney maskless (and therefore without this alter ego), yet he felt remorse(?) at the climax when it was ripped off of him. thoughts or answers on this question, anyone?",vjd5ge

It didn’t meet my expectations based on all the reviews, but it didn’t disappoint me. That’s not something I can say for a handful of movies that came out last year. The Grabber’s design is also so simplistic, yet somehow works that I could see it being easy to replicate. Now that makes it seem a bit more realistic.

Ethan Hawke was only in this movie for 20 percent of it, but his presence was felt every time he was on the screen. The rest of the characters in the movie were not well written, weak characters and poor acting. 
If not for Ethan Hawke in it, I would of thought this was a Netflix original movie, with how cheesy a lot of it was. It’s like the spent all of their budget was spent on Ethan, and got no name actors just to fill in the blanks. I never felt like Phin was in real danger, the only time it felt really suspenseful is when Phin walked past the grabber as he slept. 

I know people are going to bring up the fact, “how can Phin talk to dead people”, and “how can the sister see visions in her sleep”, well her mom was a psychic, and it was past down to her kids, which in real life, a psychic can talk to the dead or a psychic can see into the future, so it made sense to me that they had those abilities. All people have to do is Google to find that out, so I don’t think that’s a valid thing to complain about.

Black Phone is perfect new age thriller.

As humans we tend to try to justify peoples bad actions, the way they hurt us. It's perfectly normal.

In thrillers, specifically, they tend to have a back story for the killer that breeds empathy from its viewers. Whether it be trauma or just plain mental illness. This makes us feel comforted by the thought of, ""What they did was bad, but at least we know why they did it.""

In Black Phone, we did not get this clarity. The killers back story was not given to us, only vague hints about the phone itself and whatever potential history behind him and it. But nothing more.

These unanswered questions leave us picking at them, wanting some sort of justification for his actions.

Similar to Michael Myers, and his psychiatrist. Michael didn't have a perfect childhood, but it wasn't horrible either. His mother loved him, his sister was a bit harsh but that can be chocked up to sibling bickering, his moms boyfriend was verbally abusive to him but not horribly either, certainly not enough to justify killing. His psychiatrist tried to find answers for Michael's killings and died believing sometimes people are just pure evil.

Black Phone gives us the similar opportunity to allow our minds to explore, but without any factual evidence as to why he did what he did.",vjd5ge

ipoe93h,"I had a more sinister ending come to mind when I was watching the movie. When Finney was escaping and gets to the door, the Grabber changed the lock and he doesnt know the combination. We think the Grabber is dead, but isn't and drags Finney back into the basement. It then pans to the cops and his sister outside just across the street.

I'm glad that's not how it actually happened, but I thought for sure the Grabber would've changed the lock.",vjd5ge
ipy637i,"This movie was horrible! Zero background provided about the Grabber and his motives. The clairvoyant sister and protagonist did not have any back story other than a few lines from the father. This movie was superbly undercooked and unfinished. All being said, acting was stellar and the only redeeming aspect. 5/10",vjd5ge
iqukhhc,"So this was watchable, but fairly mediocre in the end.

IMO the biggest problem is that the villain was just lazy and stupid and not that menacing, especially compared to everything that came before. Hell, we just watched all sorts of brutality against kids- by other kids, and then that scene with the protagonist's dad beating his sister. Then the ""Grabber"" comes along, does the kidnapping, and then?

Comes down the stairs to the door every once in a while, whines a little, makes a few vague threats, gives the kid some macaroni and soda, and  fucks off back up the stairs for long stretches. Never lifts a hand, never bothers to come in and see the missing grate in the window, or the huge hole being dug in the ground, or the other huge hole dug out from the wall behind the freezer. Never shows any concern about the variety of potential weapons he's left around for the kid, nothing. And for all the complaints about jump scares in this movie, there is NOT one scene where we hear the grabber bounding down the stairs and catching or nearly catching the kid in the act of trying to climb out our literally burrowing through concrete.

Oh, and the ghosts that keep calling? Good thing they're not calling collect because they sure waste a shit load of Finn's time being cryptic, or calling and not saying anything when he answers.

Meanwhile, the actual scariest character in the movie, the abusive drunk father? No comeuppance for him, no scene of the kids standing up to him, nothing.",vjd5ge
ir4h6yh,"This started so good. The first hour or so I kept checking the time to see how much was left because I didn't want it to end, which is always a welcome change. Just really tightly constructed suspense and a surprisingly spooky execution of the ghostly help premise.

The ending was a letdown for me though, from pretty much the point where he escaped the first time. Everything got very predictable and honestly a little goofy, and it became clear to me how unnecessary the sister and Max plotlines were. And even the dead kids helping him felt a little slight. It's like they had multiple ideas and didn't know what to go with so they just went with all of them even though they naturally compete with each other.",vjd5ge
is61ek3,"I found it really creepy how when the grabber lies to finn in the beginning with his reassurances that nothing bad will happen, he has the grinning mask on,  and then in the 'next phase' of the 'naughty boy game' he switches to a scowling one

I never really felt like I had a chance to be afraid of him in the small exchanges Finn and him had. I could never really gage how crazy he'd take things until the very end so the scene where he unlocks the bike lock could've had way more tension than what was there.",vjd5ge

-Too many cheap jump scares, but there were definitely tense moments of true terror and dread to somewhat counterbalance those jump scares

-The Pink Floyd scene was incredible, due in part to the song itself (“On the Run”) and how well it fit the scene and time period

idshxu5,"This movie was solid and enjoyable, but I think it could’ve been truly great with an extra 30-45 mins on the runtime. I wanted The Grabber to be more fleshed out and complex, because at the end of the movie, he just seemed like a creep with a collection of freaky (albeit cool as fuck) masks rather than a compelling and original character. Also, most of the jumpscares were cheap, predictable, and pointless, except for the kids appearing in front of the sister, leading her to find the house. Regardless, the atmosphere was perfect and Ethan Hawke delivered a fine performance, as did both child actors. I really liked the sister’s involvement, it added depth to the story. Also, massive shoutout to Madeleine McGraw. The belting scene was quite literally the most disturbingly realistic crying scene I’ve ever witnessed. That girl’s a powerhouse. It was cool how Finney’s re-attempt of each escape method resulted in combined elements which added up to his own escape. The ending was admittedly one of the most satisfying horror finales I’ve ever seen. I give it a 7.5/10.",vjd5ge

if03zfy,"Pretty solid movie, but I left the theater feeling like they left a lot on the table that could've made it such a better film. I think the movie played it too safe in some regards, especially the ending. I think they could've done more with The Grabber's brother, an example being that he was a part of the kidnapping and harboring the children. For example, the newspaper clippings and the map of abduction locations he had were not for him being a wannabe detective, but it was him covering their tracks. The ending was really predictable, I feel like they could've done more with the idea of there being two houses, and maybe make it seem like the cops got there too late. Perhaps a twist that the lead boy actor never made it out alive, but I guess that would be too dark. I thought the violence with all the kids was a little too much for kids their age. Maybe I just grew up in a way more civilized neighborhood and school system(lol). Ethan Hawke was great in this for what little he was in it. Some of the young cast gave some solid performances. I think it's worth a watch which is why I'd give it a 7/10.",vjd5ge

Ethan Hawke does really well in the horror genre and was more than enough reason for me to check it out.  Mason Thames was good as a child actor, but I have to say Madeleine McGraw, the sister, stole the show! Everytime she was on screen her character had my attention and had my theater laughing with her funny parts. She really was the sister you wanted to have as a child. 

Oh and I cant forget to include all the other horror movie references! The one that stood out to me the most was IT; from the killer holding balloons to the sister riding her bicycle outside in the rain wearing that yellow rain coat!

ifg660q,"I didn’t know it was based on a short story. But for me I was somewhat disappointed with the movie.

It spent too much time at the beginning with the first 2 kids that get kidnapped first. It could have been better without that, and instead more time with The Grabber.

Also, the brother was so underutilized. It would have been better if we never knew that there was a brother and if the movie would have made us think that the brother was The Grabber, so when he gets killed by The grabber at the end everyone would have been like WTF!

I also think that the whole talking to the dead children was done kinda cheesy. Having the kids walking around with that bad looking make up pretending to be dead made the whole thing less intriguing and more wacky than it needed to be. It would have been nice if not all the ghost were good so he would have had to try and figure out who to trust.

Last but not least, some elements of the movie made it feel like an adult thriller/horror movie but other elements made it feel like a teen scary flick kinda like IT part 2.

igf673o,"I see a lot of hate for this movie and I don’t know, seems like people were expecting too much and then got their hopes up and decided to call it a shit movie. I’m also seeing a lot of people saying things went unexplained and I’m not sure how considering every question I had throughout the movie was eventually answered by the movie itself. So either people didn’t pay attention or were just focused too much on the horror aspect of the movie and didn’t actually intake the storyline.

ighjl18,"The movie was good. I generally have a strong dislike for movies and shows that involve child murder but was convinced to give it a shot. The two main child characters were phenomenally acted and The Grabber did a convincing job as a demented lunatic. It was very satisfying seeing him get what was coming to him when Finney broke his neck, but the ending feels like there is something missing for me. 

Maybe I would've wanted some resolution for the dead kids, like they get to go to heaven or something? Maybe I would've preferred the bad guy to just get incapacitated by Finn and then arrested? 

I was frustrated that they gave so much screentime to the cops but didn't have them contribute to the story that much, if you're going to have a subplot like that then it should have a resolution that makes more sense. The dreams led Gwen to the bodies but not to where her brother was fighting for his life? I dunno, I suppose it makes sense that the ghosts were helping both siblings solve their own problems independently but I think the two plots could've been merged and it would've worked out just as well if not better.",vjd5ge

igm4tt9,"Loved the movie, but just for fun here are a few things that could have played out differently for a twist ending with the dialogue given in the film.

The 5 victims are not dead. Perhaps they have been drugged and made to think they are actually dead, given they are in a basement filled with dirt and they are kids it's doable. Because the two houses are similar and across the street, they both share a black phone that used to be connected. The Grabber states that the phone doesn't work, not since he was a kid. He also says that he thinks it's static electricity that causes it to ring. This would have been a great twist ending, if the static electricity causes the phones to ring and connect to one another despite being disconnected (I'm sure they can logic it somehow) and the kids in the other end are also trapped and are trying to help Finn escape. The children repeat themselves constantly and don't talk very long which could be explained by the connection dropping out. The police could have gone to the wrong house and found all the kids alive and then ventured to the other house. Although if the dead kids are seen by Finnie this wouldn't work, you would have to take the scenes where they are actually seen out and only hear the voices. Also the kids didn't ever see the grabbers face (properly) they could assume the grabber was the dead brother or he could frame his brother to make it look like he was the real killer. He would have to kill Finnie in order to get away with it though.

I know the movie is based off a book but it would have been a bit more  of an in depth take on the original story. Let me know what you think",vjd5ge
igmnv0o,which was the dog breed?,vjd5ge
ignd1r8,I get so aggravated at most horror/thriller endings because it's always the bad guy being sort of kind of maybe neutralized and the good guy/girl letting their guard down only for the bad guy to jump back up and another final battle ensues.

ih5y3tg,"Ethan Hawke's performance was brilliant but this movie should have been so much better than it was. They had a classic in their sights.

The brutal and unforgivable child abuse scene was completely unnecessary and ruined the father's character. It made him irredeemable, but it felt like the rest of the movie was trying to talk us into sympathizing with him.  Uh. No. The father did more damage to Finney's sister than The Grabber did to Finney.

They could have entirely cut the sister's supernatural subplot out of the film and walked away with nothing changed. In fact, they could have cut the cops out entirely, too. And the brother. And the second house. And the sister leading them to the house. And the shot-for-shot ripoff of The Silence of the Lambs wrong house reveal. It all meant nothing.

Finney saved himself and walked out of the house, after inexplicably entering the same combination on the lock he'd already defeated in his earlier escape. Was it placed back on the door only to further arouse the suspicions of the Grabber's coke-addled brother?

The first escape should have lasted five minutes and been way more tense than it was. Instead, the kid runs straight down the sidewalk instead of into neighboring yards, before running into the van and getting caught immediately.

Finney nonchalantly walking out of the house after killing the only threat to his life made half of the script entirely pointless. Why was the dog even introduced? Purely to give Finney something useful to grab out of the  freezer that the ghost kid somehow knew was behind the basement wall?

There were some really cool shots, some cool effects, and some neat editing tricks, but it felt like they were shooting a draft of the script. And two people wrote the script. That is not good.

That said, I did laugh a lot, and the sister was great. Probably the best part of the film other than Ethan Hawke. It's too bad they fumbled her potential, and with it, the potential of the film.",vjd5ge

Don't even know how he solved it and figured out his brother was the culprit, he just looks at the same map he always had and ""gets it"" for some reason. But never questions the combination lock on the front door? Lmao. Why even have this character since he adds nothing of much value and complicates the plot.

Having a supernatural plot with ghost kids helping him AND a sister with some kind of shining-like dream gift felt like too much. Should have been one or the other. It all just felt underdeveloped and totally forced the way it is in the movie now. Apparently there's no sister in the short story it's adapted from? They wrote that for the movie. She didnt even do anything relvant with her psychic visions until the end except see the house where he ended up burying kids.

Lot of the dialogue felt stiff. And not just for the kids. The cops too. At the end where they find the basement and talk aloud about these are the bodies and he must murder them somewhere else. Just delivered awkwardly and sounds force fed to the viewer.

Theres a serial murderer abducting kids in the town that everyone knows about and some creepy van pulls up and a guy gets out and asks if you want to see a magic trick...and you smile and say yes?

ihf6id8,"It was awful. Legit one of the actually upsetting scenes in the film. There's a weird scene where The Grabber watches Fin as he sleeps. He's definitely doing pedophile stuff, but that scene was still more tame. In this scene, where the girl is best, she is begging him to stop. I had an abusive Dad myself, and I asked him to stop so many times. He is bipolar, and was awful to me. The worst part is that there are many adults who support Dad's beating their daughters.",vjd5ge
ighob0k,Very common in India. I am from India. Kids get beat up all the time.,vjd5ge

iir258y,"Just watched this movie tonight. The scene where Gwen gets beaten (interestingly, my youngest daughter's name) reminded me of the beatings my brother and I got as kids in the 70s, often much worse.

ihzwms2,"Yes omg her acting there was so great!!!!

Also the sister character felt a bit pointless, they could've had Finn as the one who got beaten for having visions and then coming to terms with it and his father by the end. I don't think the kids fighting scenes were really needed either. Sayin that I actually did like the film.",vjd5ge
iid6a3d,Honestly I thought it was appropriate for that era majority of parents disciplined their kids that way then.  Her reaction and the argument that followed was very realistic.  The father was seeing his dead wife personality in the daughter and thought he could beat it out of her along with any info she knew.   Without rambling it made the movie more real.,vjd5ge
il5a34q,"Late to the party but I just saw this film.

Thing is guys - it isn't at all unrealistic. Our parents parents, a lot of them considered this normal.

One of my parents said even asking a question or if they could get something other than water and they'd get roared at, and the other told me they are their siblings would get beaten with belts, and the whole time their mum would be crying later on about how she hates that they make her do it.

Sounds sickening to us but honestly - it was norm. Could you also imagine someone else hitting our kids? We'd go down for murder, but back then as adults we would have been seen to be well be in our right to discipline other people's children. 

She's gonna be a big star one day. I haven't seen a child actor put on that kind of performance, period.",vjd5ge

idl6gqn,"My theory of the phone breathing was that it was Finn's mind's way of processing that spirits were there and wanting to communicate in general, between times when they had something specific to say. I thought The Grabber was already psychic or magical, so he could also experience it but didn't want to. Either because he on some level knew that he'd be talking to the boys he'd killed, or because of something in his unknown backstory. He doesn't just rip the phone out, I think on some level it's part of his game that he hasn't articulated to himself and is afraid of.",vjd5ge

ie5446x,Maybe I’m misremembering but I could swear every time the breathing happened the Grabber was on his way to pay the kid a visit so I thought it was some sort of warning signal. Probably wrong though,vjd5ge
idv5iuy,"My theory on why Ethan Hawke can hear the phone is that in the movie, people with mental illness and trauma gain some heightened sensitivity to such things.  The way the Grabber whipped the kids with a belt mirrored how their own Dad whipped them with a belt, and insinuated that the Grabber experienced horrible abuse as a child and that’s why he does what he does.  Their Mom clearly suffered from mental health issues as well, and may have had similar ability.",vjd5ge
ig6op9p,I’m more interested in what exactly the black void was that fucking yoinked the tough blonde kid into the abyss. Do the ghosts have a time limit? Or is it like if they reveal too much they get sent to oblivion,vjd5ge
idwmhpf,My guess is he cAn hear the phone cuz he was raped and abused as a child in the basement,vjd5ge
ie5af13,"Way late on this but it seems like this magic is a double edged sword. Presumably (and this may be a leap) the effect has a lot to do with who is reaching out from beyond. So Finn and his sister were hearing the dead children and so were able to overcome the Grabber. But the Grabber and Finn’s mother may have heard evil dead people or something. 

It’s also possible that child abuse leads to this power somehow. I mean we only see the dad abuse them after the fact so I can’t exactly back it up but it seems clear that the Grabber was abused and so we’re Finn and his sister. We don’t know about the mom at all of course so it’s just an idea.",vjd5ge
ie4j40u,"Idk about the breathing, but I assumed they both could hear the phone ring because it *was* actually ringing. The ghosts were obviously real, they knew things Finney couldn't and were moving things around, so them being able to communicate through the phone makes sense with the rules the movie establishes.",vjd5ge
ids84kt,"It's the same in the novel, he wakes up a couple times and thinks he sees the phone (and i think the wall?) breathing, but he chalks it up to it being a hallucination or from his exhaustion (iirc). Nothing else is done with it.

Maybe it's representative of all the spirits 'living' within the phone, and it's his only life line, so it's... alive in his mind. I think Grabber hearing it ring could just be because, well, the place is haunted and it's not entirely limited to Finn, so I wouldn't be surprised if he'd also hear it occasionally too. He does brush it off to being static electricity or something.

Plus The Grabber we get on screen is exactly how he's written on the page with nothing new added to his character, even his dialogue and actions are pretty much verbatim. I wish they had expanded on him more, not explain EVERYTHING, but replace the dad scenes with more Grabber scenes. I know 'less is more' in horror sometimes, but here there was just... nothing added to his character, felt like a missed opportunity at times. Ethan was still creepy as hell when he appeared though, just wish they could have added a bit more depth and despite the whole kidnapping/child murdering aspect, he never really felt THAT threatening. Save for the brother ax scene and ensuing fight, or when he captures finn after he briefly escapes, that's like the only time we get to see the extent of how vicious he could be. I just wish they could have taken his character further in regards to how evil he was, just felt like a bit of a missed opportunity. I'm probably not explaining what I mean well-enough, I'm exhausted, but he just lacked a certain... edge?  Loved the masks though!",vjd5ge
ig2htm2,"I thought Finn was the Grabber from the very beginning. That’s how he knew how all the other boys died, and wasn’t getting killed himself. There was also the quote where the boys on the phone told Finn that the Grabber used to hear the phone too. Also, how the grabber was waiting upstairs with his belt was similar to Finn’s dad using his belt and traumatizing the kids. I kept waiting for the transition of Finn turning into the Grabber, but enjoyed how the movie unfolded nonetheless.",vjd5ge
ie9gwi0,"I just saw this movie. I’m pretty sure the phone is symbolism for seeking help for mental health. I just don’t see the significance of having one of the kids say the line “he can hear it too, but he thinks it’s broken” the movie is pretty heavy handed for the symbology they used for abuse/neglect/alcoholism so I’m pretty sure the significance is that the kid comes from an alcoholic abusive father so he’s able to hear the other kids warnings, idk it just seems like the movie had so much it wanted to say about mental health and seeking help and just abandoned the plotline to add in a cheap character to kill off that didn’t have any real significance. It sucks because while I still thought this movie was pretty good, I think there is actually a very good movie underneath the editing. Ethan Hawke was also underused, cmon he’s a fantastic actor USE HIM.",vjd5ge
if1tqmm,"Phone breathing = Probably hallucinations from being dehydrated, starved, locked little to no sunlight and only consuming soda and protein.

there’s something I wanna bring up however and that is the symbolism in the mask. it’s a pretty common trope for masks in stories to bestow a sense of “justice” in the wearer as they carry out horrible acts of violence, such as in lord of the flies. we have proof of this symbolism being used in TBM when Finney ripped off the grabber’s mask during the fight scene. the grabber looked utterly defeated and disappointed in himself, and we may infer that, psychologically, he “becomes the grabber” only when he wears this mask. This is also why when he was staring at Finney while he slept he didn’t take it off and instead we learned it’s a two-piece mask, the upper portion removed for visibility. 

what I am confused about is how he was able to abduct Finney maskless (and therefore without this alter ego), yet he felt remorse(?) at the climax when it was ripped off of him. thoughts or answers on this question, anyone?",vjd5ge
ik3jg41,I would've loved to have seen more of The Grabber too. But I really loved how we didn't get his backstory. If we did then we would've felt sympathy towards him. So the film really does show what he truly is. Nothing more than a psychopath.,vjd5ge

>Super refreshing to have a smart, capable protagonist in one of these movies.

  
I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but smart and capable isn't what I'd call our protagonist.
  
He had a variety of weapons at his disposal.  He could have used the pop bottles ((un)broken), plate ((un)broken), lid of the toilet or even metal rods from inside the toilet.
  
When The Grabber was sleeping, he could have smashed his skull in with that ceramic toilet lid and then stabbed him with any broken pieces.
  
I understand that the protagonists whole problem was fear and confrontation, but he had so many chances to kill or incapacitate The Grabber.
  
Regardless, I loved the movie.
  
Ninja Edit:  The kids in this movie are some badass fighters.",vjd5ge

if7u5v5,"I think they said no one's ever heard someone on the other end of the line until Finn, but I might be wrong!",vjd5ge
ihfcwso,"Maybe it has something to do with the whole ""naughty boy"" bit being tied with the loss of innocence. Finn has been taking the beatings but refusing to fight back. This perceived innocence made him special. Before the final confrontation, he is told this will be the last call. But it rings again just before his innocence is completely lost.

And that could explain why the grabber hasn't seen it since he was a kid.",vjd5ge

Thanks in advance!!!",vjd5ge
idk0sek,"Yeah, that was nice. Before that it felt like he was living out that their escape attempts would all be doomed to fail, even if they'd had time to complete them, which was damn grim.",vjd5ge
idq0jgs,"This really felt like it needed some more time to flesh out characters or develop the Grabber - it almost felt like there was no rising action because once the kid got kidnapped, we as an audience never had any indication of how close or far he was from being murdered.

Also the movie FELT like it was trying to say something about the periods  growing fear of ""stranger danger"" vs the violence that kids of that generation often faced at home or in school with basically no police intervention, but it never solidified into a substantive message.",vjd5ge
ie55ely,It was *so* satisfying watching all those dead end methods come together at the end! I was surprised that he didn’t just use the lid from the toilet tank instead of a phone packed with dirt but… it’s thematic i guess lol,vjd5ge
ihey8xj,"The movie left me with a couple a questions about the history of the other kids and also the grabber but I am 110% happy having it as a mystery. The story felt very ‘optimized’, not fat, glaring loose ends and every minute seemed purposeful and worth watching.",vjd5ge

igcxifj,Ditto,vjd5ge
idqsaon,"My favorite part is what you mentioned about the supernatural elements being very vague. There is nothing I hate more in horror than over-explanation and putting the evil right out in the open. They don’t feel the need to do that here. How does the phone work? Where are the dead kids and what kind of state are they in? They leave it a mystery to think about. That last question especially got to me. The way the one kid looked like he was forcibly torn back to some other dark existence was chilling.

The movie itself is generally more subtle as well. We don’t really have the Grabber explain his motivations or get much background on him. He’s a boogeyman, the depths of his depravity encased in a porcelain smile. I appreciated that.",vjd5ge
idjkest,I loved the soundtrack too and was really happy to see it was Mark Korven. His work with Robert Eggers is some of my favorite ever and I was really sad to see he wasn't part of The Northman.,vjd5ge

idqos2k,"I don’t think the grabber hurt when he wasn’t wearing his mask. It was more of a psychological thing, that he needed to wear it when down in the basement (probably due to trauma he experienced down there)",vjd5ge
ii6tgh7,"I went for a more realistic train of thought, thinking he could communicate with the dead children because he was showing signs of early schizophrenia/dementia just like the mom had, everything they where telling him to do was alredy on his mind because he is really inteligent, but my theory kinda dies off when one of them tells him the combination for the lock (still he could have picked up a glimpse of the numbers when there was light in the room).",vjd5ge

idiptlv,[removed],vjd5ge
ie5albu,"I think it was more like the flashback scene showing how Finney and Vance had met before, which then blended into one of the sister’s dreams. I don’t think they actually dropped him off there in reality, just her dreams giving a clue as to the location. Just like how Vance didn’t actually carve the killer’s address into that guy’s arm because that was before he even got kidnapped. It was confusing but on point for dream logic",vjd5ge
ig2htjx,"Vances story was the one that I would have loved to see a little more of. Especially since I couldn't see any obvious injuries on his ghost. I imagine he must've been one of the ""naughtiest boys"" so the grabber must have done something pretty bad to him back, right? Honestly when I saw the meat in the fridge I assumed the worst about where those dead bodies went...",vjd5ge
ij9kjk3,I don’t think the police dropped him off at the grabbers house I think the dream led fins sister to the house to get more clues. Because as she enters the police car fin is in the doorway of the store and they don’t acknowledge her. The police ride was the final clue for her,vjd5ge
ikqie1b,The back of his head is bloody! It looks like it was bashed in.,vjd5ge
inyih7w,"I think every kid came back as a ghost to explain what escape plan they tried that led to their death. I thought it was implying that The Grabber caught Vance when he broke into the freezer so he locked him in there to freeze to death. That would cause a little, but not a lot, of blood. Plus that would take a lot of time and be an awful painful death.",vjd5ge

ido80td,"> Not a damn person has brought up the expert use of Pink Floyd in the movies score?

idj9rid,Loved the application of that.,vjd5ge
idmgdb8,I’m also here for the Pink Floyd scene. That actually elicited an emotional response from me. I’m only 28 but found that album in my teens and it’s one of my favorites. It fit that scene SO well,vjd5ge
idpxfkq,"I’m a young millennial and I picked up on it. Don’t worry, many of us appreciate it. There was actually a guy in the front row of the theater with a guitar strumming along. Wasn’t sure what to think of that lol",vjd5ge

But alas, it didn’t happen. Still an awesome use of “On the Run,” which almost never gets played in popular media.",vjd5ge
idlyudg,"I mentioned it yesterday!  That was a perfect song choice.

idksegi,"I think that's right, but he's also a kid, and the grabber killed at least 2, maybe 3 if you count Bruce, stronger kids. The toilet lid would be too heavy for anything other than a sneak attack.

idyqxov,Great analysis. Fuck yea!,vjd5ge
ifkaid3,"I have one small point that I think you missed. The paperboy is the one who tells Finn about the trap which is why he's careful while going up stairs to check on the grabber. Finn also finds out later from one of the victims that the grabber uses the ""naughty boy"" game to give him a reason to beat and kill the kids and the grabber had not beaten him so far as he didn't try to escape",vjd5ge

The best way out of Hell is always through.",vjd5ge
ihtlijm,"Absolutely love your comment, especially the bits about how trauma impacts the kids, how Finn’s experiences make him respond the way he does when abducted, and how the Grabber is using these kids to deal with his own trauma (the bit about being envious!!)

To add on, the mask likely acts as a shield for him against his trauma when he enters the basement; I believe it’s half on whenever he’s acting as a caretaker and full on when he know’s he’s doing something horrible; which is why it was so awful to have his face exposed in the basement because he’s being forced to become the abused child he was instead of this facade he holds using the mask to become the abuser

Much like how the alcohol is a mask for the dad, and how he flip flops between loving and abusive; the Grabber inflicts the same hot/cold behavior on these kids and finds reasons to justify the harm in order to explain his miserable upbringing",vjd5ge
ie3lhxx,love this take and agree with everything u said,vjd5ge
igironh,"I love how you summarize it. Well said. It's one of the emotional scenes of that movie, seeing the grabber with tears, it gives the idea that he's a broken man who lost his childhood. Hurt people, hurt people. It's painful to see, and yet it's sending out a strong message about the cycle of abuse, and how the only way to end it is to stand up for one's self.",vjd5ge
ighj9a5,Thanks for this great analysis! Had some questions after the movie and this addressed it!,vjd5ge
im8wpwb,i know i am soooo late but your comment just made me realize! was the father insisting on silence foreshadowing? i believe the paper boy warns him to be extra quiet and he’s pretty skilled at doing so!,vjd5ge
idnrwwr,"For me, it was >!when the dad started crying and started apologizing, begging for forgiveness. It was nice to see him get to repent and ask for forgiveness for his abusiveness!<",vjd5ge
idqn5n8,"That last phone call got to me, specially when he tells his friend that he misses him.",vjd5ge
ie3jkjw,the final call had me in my FEELS. The fact that robin told him he had been with him the whole time really hit me. I could just imagine robin watching finney figure out each n every clue the boys gave. Him just watching with pride and sadness as he watches his friend grow right in front of his eyes but also cheering him on. I would have really appreciated if they had shown the boys more in the background while finney was doing as they told him too it would have added a different element to see glimpses of them throughout the movie watching finney rather than have their scene and then not be seen again,vjd5ge
idn8d4z,I highkey almost when they reunited LMFAO,vjd5ge
iduxhyh,I cried when Finns sister was >!getting whiped. Oh my God.  The acting in that scene gutted me. Also teared up a little when Finn and Robin had their phone call.!<,vjd5ge

idruynz,What other horror from this year would you recommend,vjd5ge
il4vx4u,"Totally agree about Ethan Hawke. If you haven't already seen it, he did a great AMA a while back.",vjd5ge
ieo012g,One of the dumbest lines in the dumbest movie of the year.,vjd5ge
idw5jig,"I agree, bullying as well, which again is usually a byproduct of kids who come from abusive households.  Before cell phones and social media, kids going through these things felt so much more alone and didn’t know others went through it unless they met kids who did, and they didn’t have the means to document things like with cell phones to upload to social media, or the internet to read about these things.  The way the girl spoke to the police was a reaction to how out of touch support services were with those they were meant to protect.  That part might not have changed much.",vjd5ge
igc8bye,"Nah, sounds like you're reading just enough into it. I like this interpretation.",vjd5ge
ihtm1an,"This is so good!! I love the idea that part of escaping and healing from trauma involves conversation and learning from the people around you, especially if they are able to empathize with your experiences. Maybe I’m also reading too much into it when I say this - Finn leaves the basement (source of trauma) and ends up directly into his sister’s arms, his one primary source of a loving, safe relationship",vjd5ge
ierj9vk,This movies trailer was particularly bad about spoiling every single thing up till the point where pink Floyd came on... So like 90% of the movie,vjd5ge

iieagwk,SAME. And so glad i did.,vjd5ge
idm0ouk,"The brother character is in the short story. He shows up *very* close to the end and you assume that’s how Finn is gonna get away. His fate in the movie is exactly as it is in the story. It caught my wife off guard and I told her it was coming, so I think it played great.",vjd5ge
idr6oz9,I thought the Finn was going to kill the brother thinking he was the grabber. Then the grabber would pack up and start doing the same thing in another state.,vjd5ge
idjky9t,"It felt like Derrickson and Hawke wanted to do a Sinister reunion so they got Ransone in on the act, which is why his character seemed somewhat extraneous. Also, it doesn't seem like Ransone is particularly busy, which is a shame.",vjd5ge
idlh8w3,My group and I took him as a red herring.  We wonder if he's in on it at first.  Grabber said he doesn't kill.  He could be lying or he could be a handler for the kids in regards to Max.,vjd5ge
idin1k3,I thought that it was a great reveal when they panned from the brother above to the cellar below.,vjd5ge
ie9z5i3,"I feel like the brother was an excellent contrast to the darkness of the film. The scene when he is snorting coke on the table and the camera pans down to Finney shows that the answer (where Finney is) is quite literally right under his nose. It also shows how batshit the Grabber is, he axed his brother and didn’t even think twice about it. There’s nothing more terrifying than that",vjd5ge
idnf75x,"It was a little odd but I loved the inclusion of the brother.  In the books he only exists to show up and die.  Giving him a citizen sleuth angle made it very interesting because you think it's him and later on you realize right house, wrong brother.",vjd5ge
ie4nfkc,Just have him staying in the house across the street. Would also explain why the cops were eager to send multiple units to a house a little girl saw in her dream; because they already had a strange interaction with the person living there.,vjd5ge
ii7sf5w,"Max’s presence explained why The Grabber was a little frazzled when he first met Finn in the basement, and why there were “complications” he had to deal with, and then Finn proceeded to ask if someone else was there. I think it bought Finn the extra time he needed to talk to the kids on the phone and figure out some of their escape plans.",vjd5ge
idw7kli,Seems like the role was specifically made for James Ransone last minute lol it just felt out of place,vjd5ge
idq4vor,I think it would have been a better twist if he was in on it the whole time and he was only pretending that he didn’t want him to find out,vjd5ge
iil09f9,"I didn’t hate him, but the biggest lie in the movie was definitely when he told the cops that he could help them.",vjd5ge
ir4iddr,Yeah it added nothing except for misdirecting the police and the very predictable plot point of him getting killed after finding the kid. Wish they would've at least explained why he was so hesitant to go in the basement?,vjd5ge
idr0r6f,There were two houses. The brother was in the other house.,vjd5ge

idiefv0,"Yeah the beating scene was really well done, the actress was a trooper lol.",vjd5ge
idqefxm,As someone that got beat like that.. oof yeah that little girl had the acting down. Those little moments of rebellion that just make things worse were so spot on. And the way she was crying. It was uncomfortable to be transported into that so vividly.,vjd5ge
idr1mzt,"The belt scene between the father and daughter was the most distressing scene by a lot for me. I wouldn’t call it scary, but knowing that shit actually does happen, and how great the young actress was (I genuinely couldn’t believe someone so young could elicit such emotions), made it the most terrifying part to me.",vjd5ge
idqr8yl,It was weird how the scariest scene was the father giving the belt beating. The grabber didn’t do anything half as scary except alluding to a belt beating,vjd5ge
ie1xvye,I loved how there’s a creeper in a creeper van stealing kids in a small town and yet every kid is still just wandering home from school alone…,vjd5ge
idmqrrg,"Especially since it was set up with the mom.  She had visions, drove her insane so she killed herself.   Clearly the gift was passed to the kids.  Would rather had that explored more",vjd5ge
idr2vpi,Yes I loved that.,vjd5ge
ir4ipsx,When he actually used it in the fight it was a bit silly though. The grabber kept waiting and lunging at him exactly when he'd back up like a video game boss with programmed attack patterns. You'd think by the fourth time he was hit he'd figure out what was going on and stop playing exactly into Finn's hand...,vjd5ge
ij0rlec,">Some of the acting wasn't great but kid actors almost always are lacking. 

Oh man I read a lot of comments disagreeing with this until I found you. I did not like the acting from any of the kids except for Finnie. I got laughs from Gwen, but I didn't think she or her father were very convincing in the belt scene at all. The writing was really clunky in that scene too. Definitely a solid movie, but boy did the performances take me out of it. Robin was the actual worst though. I liked their friendship, but *oof.*",vjd5ge
ids200w,People in mine clapped when he was beating him up lmao,vjd5ge
idr2kkp,"Same with mine. Then when the brother and sister hugged, everybody swooned.",vjd5ge
ieu8fp2,Somebody clapped in my theater. I thought it was an ironic cheer but I looked over and the clapper was like 12 years old so I don’t think he understood.,vjd5ge
ihmjs4k,Why do Americans think its okay to act like this in a theatre?,vjd5ge
ie3y6pc,You could be on to something because we don’t actually know the order of the boys abductions,vjd5ge
ie98frf,I think you are certainly on to something and i didn’t even think about that. I was wondering why he took them to the house and thought it was maybe because that’s where his body rested but this honestly makes sense too,vjd5ge
il4xrzr,"I don't think that's how it actually happened, seemed more like a vision showing where the bodies were mixed in with one of Vance's memories. In real life he probably carved his pinball score into the guys arm and got arrested.",vjd5ge

idid8j5,"Most of your points are the same takeaways I came away with on this movie too. Great child actors, some hilarious moments, brutal fights, a solid storyline where each kid got to help Finney out in their own way, Ethan Hawke looked like he had a blast in the role, and they didn't hold back on the more brutal parts of the film.",vjd5ge

No ambulance or police involved, weird.",vjd5ge

I’m guessing the 70-80s were even crazier. I know my uncle was an absolute terrorizer. And my dad….Christ.",vjd5ge
idn6nj9,They could’ve easily fixed this and added to the twist a little. The brother should’ve been living in the house with the dead bodies across the street from the Grabber. Then the cops kick the door in and find the brother and the dead kids and then he says something like my brother is across the street…,vjd5ge
idie8ly,Not only that but could the could have made a noise any moment he was outside the room and the brother would have likely heard. Would have been ok if the brother wasn’t legitimately obsessed with finding the boys. Really weird idea,vjd5ge

ie5ehf1,There were hints but I felt like it didn't matter. We've seen enough movies like it where the villain had some kind of horrific childhood or something that made them sick in the head in a way that would express like this. Playing games aludes to childishness or childhood trauma of some kind. The mask and it being taken away causing him emotional distress shows something like a mental illness too.,vjd5ge
ig7z4ot,"The film didn't really dwell on it, but I feel there was some kind of tenuous connection being made between the dead mother and the Grabber. Voices/dreams were telling her to do horrible things and she refused to listen. The Grabber... did.

It's likely also a metaphor for an abusive childhood, and two very different responses to that abuse.

If the two adults are unconnected (in terms of abilities) it flirts with [double mumbo-jumbo,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/gpadx0/the_immutable_laws_of_screenplay_physics_save_the/) and screenplays nowadays are usually really good about avoiding that.",vjd5ge
idiul2n,"I read the short story a couple of months. It’s a verrrrry basic and straightforward story. It’s just the kidnap scene, half of the phone calls featured in the movie and half of the Finney in the basement scenes. No getting to the upstairs, no digging the holes in the floor or the wall, not even an explanation for Ethan Hawke’s weirdness or why he kidnaps boys like how this movie kinda tried to actually explain.

Even with all of the stuff the movie added, I do agree with you it was fairly underwhelming. I kinda thought they’d do more with it after misunderstanding the trailers and assuming ‘don’t let anybody ruin the ending for you’ meant they did something different and more interesting like a twist at the end. Nope. He kills the guy and escapes just like the short story and that’s pretty much it.

It’s nothing spectacular or groundbreaking but I already know it’s gonna be a smashing success and talk of the summer. The GP looooves a competently made thriller movie.",vjd5ge
ie4o1hp,"While watching I considered the direction they were taking would reveal that the voices weren’t necessarily of dead kids, but rather the kids communicating through time while they were still alive.  There would be realizations that they are in Finn’s past and therefore would not make it out alive, so they’d work together to purposefully set up what Finn needs to escape.  The big twist might be that Finn then hears his sister’s voice, indicating that he too doesn’t survive, but sets up the last piece so his sister can defeat the grabber.",vjd5ge

It was excellent. All of it.",vjd5ge
idijkpt,Honestly it felt dull because we have all the sister stuff intermixed with the basement stuff. It removes a ton of tension from the movie.

I agree they would have found the house with the bodies eventually, and very soon in the timelines where Finney escapes, but her find would be much more useful in scenarios where he doesn't escape.

Kinda bleak but The Grabber said he was about to very slowly kill Finney, so if he wasn't in a position to fight back there might have been *some* time to zero in on the right house being so close and checking the owner.

And still bleak, but if Finney died he at least would have been the last victim thanks to her (at least the last victim in that area if The Grabber successfully escaped in some alternate scenario).  You should also compare the weight of actions to the other possible outcomes since they were happening simultaneously and in this case independently, is my gist.  You couldn't really have both of them be heroes for the same result, but they were both strong and both intentionally / actually useful.  Her dreams may have also been fucking with the psyche of The Grabber, he was also freaking out about how things weren't going well.

Saw the film a few days ago with a couple of friends, one of them brought this up.


In the Grabber's defense, so to speak, I brought up the line he said himself in the film, ""I just wanted to look at you"", he was so obsessed with Finney/his newest victim + also having to deal with his brother in the house at all times, I think that would be enough for him to overlook those things.

Why was the two houses thing presented like a shocking twist? Why does the girl's storyline take up a quarter of the movie and result in nothing? Why hire Ethan Hawke and barely use him? He has a very solid if cliche intro with the mask/balloons/van, reminiscent of It, and then he doesn't do much the rest of the movie until he's killed, which was so easy and straightforward I thought for sure another shoe would drop. But no, roll credits. The phone gimmick is run exactly the same way five or six times, the Grabber basement visits are just as repetitive, and it's _boring_.

I blame part of it on being a short story adaptation stretched to fill runtime, and part on Joe Hill just not being as talented as his father (sorry Joe but it's true).",vjd5ge

idm174m,"I really liked the movie, but you're not wrong.  I was afraid it was going to venture into horrible places like ""I Know My First Name Is Stephen"" and there would be sexual abuse of the kid.  So I ended up being pretty receptive to it as a not-very-horror movie about how kids live terrifying lives involving bullying, competition, humiliation, and authorities are total failures at making life decent or sane....in fact they are always the problem.  Ethan Hawke is just a vehicle of this theme, where the trailer makes it seem like he plays a bigger tole I'm a huge fan of teen movies like Over the Edge and wouldn't expect a movie like that to focus too heavily on any of the adults in the movie except to emphasize their shortcomings.  I think this is a horror version of that teen solidairty theme, but it's more contained in this individual ""final kid"" who benefits from the wisdom of the others, than it is about a group of kids bonding together and burning down a school.  They'll never make a movie like that again.",vjd5ge

Another clue we have is how the Grabber reacts when his mask is removed by Finn in the final fight.  It's as if his ""true self"" has been exposed to the light of day and he's mentally grappling with the fact that he's only the Grabber when he has the mask on, but a damaged victim when the mask is off.  It may also be a way that he can routinely interact with a ""tainted"" space without reliving all the traumas of abuse.

Anyway, there's a lot to work with there and more that I didn't mention.",vjd5ge
ie98n2k,the writer said that the reason that ethan hawke was rarely shown was because we are watching the film through finney’s point of view and so they wanted to show him as little as possible to give them same effect as if we were watching through finney eyes,vjd5ge
iha3c2y,"The whole mask thing,  along with the ""game"" he plays,  seems like a parallel to an abusive and manipulative parent. He wears the smile and/or shows his eyes when he wants to come across as caring... which is really a trap into luring the kid into a false sense of security, while making him feel like a good caregiver.  So,  when the kid is then ""naughty,"" he can become the devil and exact the sort of evil that he really wants.  Of course,  wearing that mask is also a way to separate himself from the evil because,  again,  he wants to absolve himself of the deed and pretend that it's the kid's fault.  Ultimately, the mask he wears in a given scene is how he wants to come across in that moment, but it's all a way of manipulating the kid into doing what will give him a ""reason"" to hurt them.",vjd5ge

igjshyp,"I think the dreams were meant to give the impression that it was for her to find her bro, when it ended up being the ghosts leading her to their bodies. Probably so they could Rest In Peace. I actually found it interesting in that respect. The dreams didn’t need to lead her right to the door because everything they taught Finn led assisted to him getting out (the hole, the grate that broke his foot, the steak for the dog). Personally, other than the grabber’s origin, I don’t feel there was much left unanswered if you were paying attention.",vjd5ge

idrqcce,"Bruce was first because it needed to be someone Finney knew so he would trust the phone’s calls/ advice. Robin had to be last for the pep talk and fight training

The Grabber’s brother was a necessary character. He serves as a distraction for the Grabber— he can’t be in the basement with Finney as much so he doesn’t notice all of the escape attempts: missing window grate, giant hole in the wall by the freezer, the rug covering the tunnel in the floor, etc. The brother’s presence also interferes with the Grabber’s ability to torture Finny so he’s able to maintain more of his strength for the finale

The masks— seems like some kind of trauma thing. He covers his face when the mask gets knocked off at the end.",vjd5ge

idinkct,I like how the first time he finally got out of the house instead of bolting into the woods to hide he just ran right into the side of the van.,vjd5ge
idni83q,His sister was needed in a way. Yes he most likely would have still gotten out because he did have a few psychic abilities but i think his sister amplified them being that hers were stronger. Although she didn’t end up saving fin she sure was close and she ended up recovering the bodies of the boys who i felt very connected to and glad they were discovered. Not to mention without a sister he probably wouldn’t have had much of a will to fight in him going back to a abuse home doesn’t seem like a great win but wanting to see your sister again who you know you have to protect gives you a bigger will to fight as well as showing how she never gave up on him they had their own fights and i think one couldn’t have happened without the other. Nobody would have looked for him as hard as his sister did and without the sister the police wouldn’t have been able to find out exactly where everything was going on,vjd5ge
idrebv2,"I agree with you about the sister's subplot. Had the exact same thought when he was rescued and realized she didn't really have anything to do with that. The actress was terrific, though.

As far as some of your other points, why do people need explanations for literally every little thing? It doesn't matter how or why the black phone works. It's a ghost story. It's just supposed to work that way to service the story and character growth.  


I could maybe understand asking why he wears the masks, but seriously? Where he got them is a concern? Why does that even matter? He's just supposed to be a creep and the masks one way to easily communicate that fact. How would finding out where he got them add to the story?

There's no reason to explain any of that stuff. That's just the way things are in this movie's world and being vague about it works much better that way. It's just odd to me how focused people get with certain aspects of a movie.  


Also, it annoys me so much when people say reviews are fake just because they disagree with them. Is it seriously that hard to comprehend that people might have different opinions than you?",vjd5ge
idlt1sd,"And we were supposed to believe that Finney’s abusive father suddenly became a healthy, good parent? Finney went from one very abusive environment to yet another kind of abusive environment at home. It’s not a happy ending despite that the movie thinks that it is.

idon8s9,Savagely beating his daughter. Seems a stretch. I mean it was the 70s. And I don't think he says he didn't kidnap those kids. I think he says he didn't hurt them there. Which is a twist but a weak one.,vjd5ge

His wife claimed to see and hear things, leading to her death. He was obviously screwed up by that and tries to stop his kids from developing the same issues.

The phone is a ghost communication device thing? Something?

The father was the shittiest character Ive ever seen. 

The whole coke head conspiracy theorist brother who has been researching the case but does not suspect his fuckin creepazoid mask wearing brother who sits in the kitchen with a weapon at night was ridiculous.

When he's sitting in the chair with the belt it's very reminiscent of an abusive/drunk father who perhaps would beat his kids senseless.

Bruce told him something along the lines of ""your arm is mint, you almost had me"" (what he repeats to him later on the phone) then they said GG. Next scene was Bruce riding his bike home, with good summertime vibes music playing, Fin launches a rocket from the baseball field and Bruce sees it parachute down and smiles, then the black van pulls Infront of Bruce and the  music fades and then the opening credits start to play with darker music and a montage of missing persons posters of Bruce and his bike abandoned etc. 

Then I'm probably missing some stuff  or mixing it up buuuuut,

Fin and his sister Gwen are walking  they come up on a group of kids yelling ""fight fight"" and it's Robin, the Mexican kid who told Fin to pack the phone with dirt, and some big guy, and the big was talking mad shit and Robin eggs him on until the big guy swings and then Robin Dodges and kicks his ass with like Karate and Wrestling and once the big guy goes down, Robin gets on top of him and keeps on punching the guys face until it's all bloody. Fin pulls his sister away and says he doesn't want to see that even though his sister points out the Big guy beat up Fin before and he had it coming. Fin says something along the lines of Nobody has that coming. 

They walk past a missing poster for Bruce and Gwen says something about The Grabber and Fin gets upset and says not to say his name. He also says something along the lines of you don't think they'll find him (Bruce) do you? And she says ""not the way they want too"". 

They go to School and Fin gets cornered in a bathroom by Three boys, Robin walks in right before anything happens and washes the blood from earlier off his hands. He tells the boys if they mess with Fin they mess with him, then they get scared and run off. Robin tells Fin he needs to stand up for himself, they talk about movies and then asks if Fin can help him with Math later. At some point Fin also asks Robin why he kicked that guys ass so hard once he was down and Robin saying about about when that many people are watching you need to make a statement.

Gwen gets called into the office and the detectives ask her what She told Bruce's sister. She had said she dreamed about a black van with black balloons, and the detectives want to know why she said that because they had found black balloons at several of the crime scenes but didn't release that information. She kinda talks some smack to them saying ""what you think I'm the grabber?"" And then they eventually come around too ""what are you not telling us?"" She says ""sometimes my dreams come true""

Fin falls asleep watching a horror movie, wakes up to his sister being beaten because the cops show up to their dad's work asking about what Gwen, because of what she dreamt""",vjd5ge

idwm0xa,I don’t think that actually happened. It was her dream leading her to the bodies. She also had that dream about her brother banging on the door trying to get out of the house which we know didn’t happen.,vjd5ge
ief93ez,"Not the same kid, but he reminded me of the boy in Krampus.",vjd5ge
idxsuln,"There's no school on the weekends so no homework.  Kids back then would sometimes sleep over at a friend's house on a Friday, but maybe not Saturday since they'd go to church Sunday mornings.  It's a little odd to do that as a routine though, plus you wouldn't be heading over right from school.  I'd go home, have dinner with family, then my parents would call up my friends parents and ask permission before driving me over or my friend's parents would drive her over.  We'd hang out, watch movies till late, spend most of the day together Saturday, and get driven home or picked up at night.",vjd5ge
ie7ctxl,"Yeah it seemed to take place over years.  In sequence it seemed like it was Bruce, then Robin, then Finney, but all the others were in years passed.",vjd5ge
ielymbs,"I was literally thinking the same thing!! That kid was super gnarly, no way the grabber got him easily. He must have chloroformed him or something to knock him out quick.",vjd5ge
iekrtam,"No, if he answered that one right he would’ve answered a subsequent one wrong, it was very much a trap.",vjd5ge
iely0sf,"No way lol. If Finny had told him his real name, the Grabber would have just kept talking, and likely not even mentioned being able to leave. He only said that AFTER Finny ""failed."" If Finny had ""passed,"" then the Grabber would have acted like there was not game or prize at all to begin with. Dude was fucked up",vjd5ge
ieqhxtz,"That was all in her dream, but she was also seeing the past, and also listening in to his ghost talking to her brother, and his ghost showing her the address.",vjd5ge
ifoecnp,"I thought the Grabber, despite so little screen time, killed it. Just gave you vibes of 70s/80s kidnappers and being scared as F of being snatched up in a van as a kid.",vjd5ge

ifdy7yx,Thanks to her they found the bodies of the other victims,vjd5ge
ifoe2af,To show that Finn had powers to talk to the dead.,vjd5ge
igf7fvg,"This is just a theory of mine but, I think when the grabber saw Finn sleeping, he saw him in what some what call a child’s “purest state”. Keep in mind the grabber said he was considering letting Finn go. The other kids were extremely quick to defy him and try to escape. Finn was somewhat slow at it compared to the others and one of the dead boys told him “you aren’t playing the game, so he can’t hurt you” “he’ll punish you if you leave before he says you can” (or something like that.) which makes sense because the game is called naughty boy. When the other kids tried to escape he punished them for trying to leave before he said they could. He took a liking to Finn (at first) because he wasn’t trying to escape until later on.",vjd5ge
ifkzfff,"Billy, Griffin, Vance, Bruce, Robin, Finney",vjd5ge
ifnhsev,I figured each kid calling him was a different day.   So like 5 days.,vjd5ge
ig3g09c,"It's hard to imagine him raping the two fighter kids with how lazy a kidnapper he is, so I don't know.",vjd5ge
ig4xfgh,"He raped them.  There’s a line where he says something like, “I won’t do anything that you don’t like” in a very suggestive way.  Also he’s only kidnapping boys.",vjd5ge
igd5xmq,"It’s never implied that he was. The line he states about not forcing him to do anything he doesn’t want to do could mean anything, but the way I took it is he’s referring to his “Naught boy” game. The ghost even says he wants him to play the game but he can’t play if the kid doesn’t go upstairs. So in those terms he means he’s not forcing Finn to play the game, he has to start it himself. Not sure why he picked boys, not sure why he did any of it. They never answered a single thing about his motives. Pretty lame movie",vjd5ge
iggh2k0,intelligent? they made the dumbest decisions.,vjd5ge
ig9xvz9,"I thought Ethan Hawke and the main character were good too but that’s about it. Some things felt super convenient like the brother being completely oblivious to what the grabber was up to, when the kid escapes and gets grabbed again the neighbours just turn on their porch lights and don’t actually check wtf is going on outside even tho they heard a kid screaming and know kids are being kidnapped. Some of the dialogue was really fucking cringe, that whole “step forward step back” bullshit was unbearable. The movie leaves so many questions with no answers. Why is he doing what he is doing? Why does he keep the phone there if it doesn’t work? The movie wasn’t that scary either and it was more of a thriller.  I was disappointed with this movie because of how highly praised it was.",vjd5ge
igqfl93,"And the grabber. 

Unless the ghosts weren't real. Possible except for the sisters dreams not making sense.",vjd5ge
igjrrv0,"They don’t say, but based on the hints in the film where he references being down there, I wonder if his father did the same to him. Not to mention, his bro was always coked up and had quite a nervous reaction to the basement door when he figured everything out.

What would you expect?",vjd5ge
igqf8cu,Yes he did. Finney didn't know the cops were next door. He had already been caught once. He had no idea what else might have been waiting. He didn't kill him enough.,vjd5ge
ighgfl3,"I thought it’s possible he didn’t actually die, at the end you see them taking out a body on stretcher in a body bag and you would think “oh that’s it he’s confirmed dead.” But remember his dead brother was also down there. They only showed one body being removed from the basement, BUT when he’s walking in the school you hear the other students gossiping about how he killed the grabber and how he did it, so it’s highly unlikely he’s still alive. Plus he would be in jail lol. Just a interesting thought but doesn’t add up. I see a prequel happening lol",vjd5ge
ihgh66c,"I was bummer we didn’t get any info on that as well but i really hope they don’t do a prequel. They’re pretty much never as good as the first film and since this was based on a short story there isn’t any source material to build that off of. It’s almost better this way I think, it just makes it that much creepier.",vjd5ge

ih073z7,Yes!!! I said the same thing.,vjd5ge
iibgvo0,The mask immediately made me think of the movie Split with James McAvoy. I thought Ethan would be entering with different masks and personalities. Glad he didn’t but still curious about the backstory of the masks. They were creepy af.,vjd5ge
ihgfke2,No because the grabber had long hair lol,vjd5ge
iiia5p9,"Physical damage, sure. But mentally what Finney went through doesn't even compare.",vjd5ge
ihgf8ou,lol yeah. Abuse psh so over the top smh,vjd5ge
ihtawmq,That sequence was melding with Finney's sister's vision/dream. So it was a little skewed.,vjd5ge
ii7oulr,Wait till they realize that segregation was 50 years ago.,vjd5ge
ihtajfb,"I think, like he mentioned to the cops, the Grabber had to be living in close vicinity to all the kidnappings as they happened so quickly. He then marked all the places the kids were abducted/last seen and they were all very close to his brother's house. And I'm sure he was wary of his brother to begin with?",vjd5ge
ij1xqr2,He said fuck HIM in reference to the grabber. Like it was revenge for him (understandably) and not so much about helping Finn.,vjd5ge

igkw87p,i felt like a lot of the choice to use the phone was more symbolic than practical - a physical manifestation of the voices of the murdered boys,vjd5ge
igcz24g,"Because it would stick out, the phone is supposed to be there. It doesn't draw attention. Also how does a porcelain toilet lid break concrete ?",vjd5ge
ihiywa8,"Because u cant hold the toilet lid well. If u hold something in a fist it will make punches hit harder. He used the phone because u can defend yourself like a boxer by raising your arms. You can throw jabs with Phone/fist but that doesnt work with the toilet lid.  
Also if he used the toilet lid the Grabber could punch against it and it might slam into Finns face. This doesnt really happen when your hands are fists.   


And its easy to grab the toilet lid too as the Grabber. I mean his name means hes probably very good at grabbing people. So hes probably doing well in ground fighting. So if there is a ground fight u can still use your fists and fingers to fight but u cant really hold the toilet lid with one hand and wrestle on the ground.",vjd5ge

idrcty1,I'm waaayyy overthinking this and applying Stephen King lore to a book written by his son (so I'm realllyyy reaching here) but I think all three characters are Shiners and that something like the Crimson King or Randall Flagg was in The Grabbers head and telling him to do some of what he was doing.,vjd5ge
iglkfg1,Exactly. He even mentions that he heard the phone ring before.,vjd5ge
ihf6c8j,"Late here but I thought it was because it was just actually ringing,  the ghost caused it to ring but then talking is only heard by Finn since he also have his Mom's gift.",vjd5ge
ihixs53,"Well here is my idea:  


I think the Grabber experienced abuse in his childhood too just like Finn and Gwen. But the outcome of it is the important part.  


First we have Gwen who reacts quite angry when she gets beaten but ultimately she gives up because the dad being an adult has more physical power.  


Finn is reacting by being passive. He is angry but he doesnt fight back. Probably because he knows his dad will take it out on Gwen because the dad also uses psychological pressure like ""Im gonna beat you twice as hard!""  


So Finn has the role of a victim. The dad tries to turn Gwen into a victim too by referencing to their mother. Obviously kids love their mum and the dad loved his wife too and it might be the reason he started drinking. Gwen doesnt want to be a victim so despite getting beaten she doesnt stop taking her dreams serious. She believes in her own powers.  


Now we have the brother of the grabber. Some kind of dork so the police doesnt take him serious. He seems to be quite childish and naive. For example not putting away the lines of drugs on the table. The police doesnt say anything about that really because I guess they can see he is just some dork and not a dangerous person.  


The Grabber is very violent and mentally unstable. Its like he has dissociative identity disorder. Sometimes he talks friendly then his voice changes and he talks quite harshly. Also he is wearing a mask which further obscures who he is. Same with being a magician. The point is that he tries to seem mysterious to create a distance between him and others because thats his way of having control.  


I think the Grabber and his brother have been abused too and they are traumatized just as Finn and Gwen. They just deal with it differently. Gwen is convinced love is the answer so she never gives up and does her best to help others and create harmony along people.Finn becomes a victim first who symbolically spoken had to be deep in the ground first before realizing that he is no victim but a fighter.  


The grabbers brother got stuck into the perspective of a child because being a child means you dont have much responsibility. You could see him taking drugs as a way of avoiding to take responsibility over his own feelings because he likely knows his brother well and that basement wasnt a shock for him. It was more like a surprise along the lines of ""I know my brother....but i didnt expect this even he is really crazy.""  


Then he gets killed like a child too. No chance. And just like Finn couldnt make the dad stop beating gwen finn couldnt stop the grabber from killing his brother. This moment is important because its the turning point. Finn doesnt want all this shit anymore. He wants to be who he really is. He doesnt want to kind of wear a mask like the Grabber that not only means he isnt true to himself but wearing a mask also means being lonely because other people cant connect to his real self.  


At the end of the movie you can see the real self of now ""Finn"" instead of ""Finney"". He is proud and strong and has no need anymore for hiding anything about him behind a mask or whatever else. The other students like it. They are impressed. They are happy to see him. Because he is happy to be himself now. Because living with such a dad but not hating or actually fighting the dad back is very hard by itself. Its why his friend said that Finn can take punches and he always gets up again. It wasnt only referring to the bullies in school but also to his dad I think.  


I got the idea the phone is breathing because its a symbolic object. The phone might really not have worked. I think the calls are simply his memories and the phone is breathing like its Finns beating hard because he is scared of believing into and trusting himself. He rememberd words hes friends said and i think he mixed it up with his own thoughts. So things like the tile floors etc. might simply have been ideas he had because he wanted to get out of the basement so badly. He killed the grabber but unlike his dad he didnt do it out of being frustrated. He fought for his own wellbeing. The dad just blames others for his problems.   


So Finn didnt kill the dog but treated the dog quite nicely by giving it some meat to eat. Also it showed that the dog isnt really dangerous. It was just the Grabber who said the dog is dangerous and now Finn will feel a lot of pain. Its like the dad saying ""im going to beat u with the belt"". And the Grabber also has a belt so I think he and his brother got abused too as kids in the same way as Finn and Gwen. And like Finn and Gwen what they made out of their lives was individual.",vjd5ge
iie2pv0,"I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. I did notice the repeated sentences, but what do you mean that the second time was a separate phone call for the grabber?",vjd5ge
ivhn5lg,"I really loved that those repeated sentences came together as a final message for The Grabber. Reminded me of a similar plot device in ""Signs"" where seemingly disjointed actions come together in the denouement.",vjd5ge
idnf22d,"Thanks for the info. I haven't seen The Shining, but I'm sure the King fans picked up on this. I think the fact that they didn't explain it worked in the movie, but for people who can make this association it just becomes even better.",vjd5ge
idnz4jt,Is this actually true?,vjd5ge
il67jkb,"Nah that’s not it. Phin didn’t go along with the plan on multiple occasions, where he could be deemed a naughty boy and it would justify the grabber killing him. 
Phin was supposed to go upstairs when the door was left unlocked, which he would of been beat senseless with the belt, and then the grabber would of killed him not too long after. 
The grabber allowed Phin to keep the item he originally cut him with, Phin didn’t use it, or do anything to threaten the grabber. 

The other kids fell into the grabbers traps and he won, Phin wouldn’t play his game, until he finally tried to escape, and that’s when the grabber felt he could finally kill him. 

Also the grabber convinced himself the phone didn’t work, so he would not know Phin was special",vjd5ge

idncx8i,"He was hallucinating it.  He hallucinated the whole phone ringing/conversations thing.  The phone and conversations happen in his mind.  Not everyone can hear the phone ring.  The grabber heard it clear a couple of times in the past, and sometimes only feintly.",vjd5ge

ier7mud,Scott Derrickson did an interview and said he didn't want to add background scenes of The Grabber. And that the studio actually asked him after the test screenings to film background scenes of the Grabber. He felt enough was implied about him to infer. And it was the implication of what his background was that made him even creepier and horrific. Learning he was abused or molested as a child takes away from that slightly. So he declined and Blumhouse went with it.,vjd5ge
ik3ju0e,"Apparently Joe Hill pitched an idea for a sequel to Scott which Scott thought was fantastic and willing to make it if the first film is successful.
Well, the Black Phone has done really well so hopefully we will get a background to the Grabber and the Black Phone!",vjd5ge

He can't punish a ""good"" child, he's uncomfortable having a good child down there, but he knows what happens to naughty children, he's on comfortable ground there.",vjd5ge
idj6ozz,"First, I dont mind having a backstory for him being a child abductor/killer. Creeps can just be creeps and that works for this movie. I feel the masks helped display the multiple personalities the grabber has- some more sensitive and some more aggressive. Theres also the part when he talks to his brother from the basement after he re-kidnaps Finny in a voice *completely* different than what he had used up to then. His “normal” voice, if you will, that he uses in day to day life when not wearing the masks.",vjd5ge
idpllcy,"Well he said he heard the phone ringing but not necessarily the voices. I thought it was implied he experienced childhood trauma. He said he spent a lot of time in the basement and it seemed as though maybe he was abused. I would have liked to see more about his psychopathy though, like the scene you mentioned with him crying and then his fear when his mask is pulled off.",vjd5ge
ikjaosb,"It's fairly clear to me from the subtext that the Grabber was beaten and sexually abused in that basement as a child, probably by a relative.  Notice also how he puts on the mask and freaks out completely when he isn't at least partially obscured by it in the basement.  He's roleplays as the ""someone else"" that did that to him.  

The phone rang for him as a kid, suggesting that someone on the other side wanted to help him but he either wasn't psychic enough or chose to not believe it.  I´m actually kind of surprised that Finn didn't have a conversation with at least one child that wasn't from the current spate of abductions.",vjd5ge

ie0sb9o,Also used the wire to trip the grabber. It really did pay off though I found the mechanics of this kind of storytelling felt a little bit like a video game or obviously an escape room experience. Good thing it was shot so well with excellent performances to keep people invested.,vjd5ge
igyjlu0,"For me the most satisfying bit was hearing a particular line from each kid that we had already heard, but now being told to the Grabber. So the tables have turned and they're all collectively getting revenge.",vjd5ge
ih5xfhe,"Same! And how the spirits' previous dialogue played out during the fight.

I've noticed people complaining about how he didn't just beat the Grabber when he had the chance, and not only is that not in service of the story elements and themes (nor simply a plot hole), but it reminds me of people in high school who'd be like ""if it were me, I'd just [insert insane, skilled and highly circumstantial win here], it's so stupid."" As if this isn't a *kid* vs an adult that had physically stronger victims and is waiting for him to do that, ending the movie right there.",vjd5ge

ihc9et7,"I enjoyed this movie; but I feel like there was a bit too much ""production by committee"" involved and the original idea was changed too much.

1) I liked where they were heading with the whole concept of the sister experiencing the kidnappings via dreams; while the dialog of the dream was the dialog finn was having via the phone; including being able to hear finn.  But this really was only played on once.

2) I also really enjoy the theme of having each of the past kids experience build up on one another so that someone could finally make it.

3) The whole child beating dad part was really kinda cringy imo.  Like every part of it was off; based on my lived experiences.  

4) Its like they had two major themes (part 1, and part 2 above); and ended up going with a mashup instead of playing just method 2 out.",vjd5ge
ihf2qiq,Almost like it was setup that way,vjd5ge
idtejlg,"I think that's what the grabber wanted though. He wanted Finney to bust a bottle and come at him with it. Grabber has clearly taken down tougher kids already, he was just waiting for an excuse to beat him to death for being a ""naughty boy"".",vjd5ge
ie0etqq,"You might be overestimating a 13 year old’s capacity for murder.

When you’re watching a movie it’s easy to say, “oh just kill the guy,” but that’s a much more nerve-wracking, risky, and weighty prospect in reality. One doesn’t just casually bash in a man’s head regardless of circumstances, especially not a child.",vjd5ge

ihgdelx,"Late to this because i just watched it last night but 

People who keep saying this are not considering the height and strength differences here.  He can’t just hide a glass shard behind his back and stab the grabber with it - he’d easily overpower finny. Even more so with the toilet cover, to get enough momentum with what little strength he had to quickly and aggressively hit and injure the grabber enough to get away seems very unlikely - the well thought out plan he put together is smarter and more effective than any of the former ideas",vjd5ge
iengg4j,"The majority of the objects that were laid out for him were tests. If he attempted to run away or attack the grabber, he would be deemed a “Naughty Boy” and killed.",vjd5ge
inyddil,"Only reason Finn won the fight against the Grabber was that he was able to prepare and catch him off guard. Perhaps when he was sleeping he could’ve done something, but by that point in the film he didn’t believe he had it in him. It took all the events of the movie to lead up to the final fight, and each child’s death inevitably leading to being integral to his success. Tragically beautiful in my opinion",vjd5ge
ien5shi,"Loved the movie but even more so, there were two (presumably) working phones upstairs too. He could have called 911.",vjd5ge
igd3nyr,Not all of a sudden. Dad referenced them both having a “gift” or whatever he called it early on in the film. I suspect Finn had already had it beat out of him enough that he didn’t make any reference to it even when it happened.,vjd5ge
ie56fik,"I saw the trailer and it looked interesting but i kinda wrote it off cause I thought it gave away the whole movie. I was like, “well now I know he’s gonna escape, whatever” but the characters surprised me with how much I cared about them and so did the way he actually escaped! Very enjoyable film",vjd5ge

It's there and observable, we're talking about it and have evidence to point it out, but it's not overshadowing anything. It never lets a thematic idea throttle the story, and it doesn't interfere with the plot and character arc for Finn.

It's kind of like a meal. I don't want everything to be the size of the main thing I'm eating, it's a side.",vjd5ge
ie1keom,"I disagree with your first paragraph. I don’t want the Grabber developed any more than he is, I feel like that would only serve to make him less scary and dreadful. And I thought that coupled with the “no indication of how close he was to being murdered” thing added tension. We don’t know much about the Grabber’s motives, and we don’t know how close Finney is to being murdered, which keeps us guessing and waiting. Only issue I had was that the structure was rather formulaic, it was obvious that none of the early attempts to escape (the window, unlocking the door, etc.) were going to work because we hadn’t yet gotten the payoff with Robin’s ghost.

I do kind of agree with your second point though. The movie hit us with some real dark and impactful scenes of parental abuse and violence between kids and never really offered any payoff for it.",vjd5ge

1. It seemed like most of the kids where stuck in a loop . They repeat a lot of the same lines over and over until it starts making sense (almost like nellie in Hill House) i’m thinking because he stepped off the beaten path of the loop he was in he was pulled back
2. He was too angry. It seemed like each of the kids had a calmness about them not peace but just a calmness. It seemed to me he was the only one who was super angry and so once he started to get to rowdy he was called back. By who? i have no idea
3. It was finney mind trying to protect him. A lot of ppl with special abilities have the ability to put a wall up to protect themselves and when vance started to get to aggressive finney mind put up a wall.

idvwi8c,"I think in this film it could be a blend of ideas - I believe the grabber was abused as a child, so the masks serve to empower him to express emotions and also make him feel powerful in a space that likely holds traumatic memories for him. This might be a reach but I also think he does it to dissociate - the vast differences between his personality depending on the mask seems like he puts on different ""characters"" as a way to manage his psyche. He only seems willing to cause direct damage to Finny when he has the horned mask on, and his voice is demonic. Maybe a recreation of an abusive male in his childhood. When he brings food, he wears a different mask and speaks in an almost childlike tone. Perhaps imitating a treatment he wished he'd received while stuck in the basement.",vjd5ge
in9x5f9,"I just finished the movie and to me it seemed like a metaphor for alcoholism/addiction. 

I first noticed when the dad called the daughter “Gwenny” as he was beating her. I think Jeremy Davies did a fantastic job in this movie, he made me believe he was a father who loved his children, lost his wife, and lost his life to addiction. Because of this, he did horrific things, but I *do* think he loved his children. 

Because that character resonated with me early on, I think I made the connection (could be totally wrong by the way, but this is how I interpreted it) that a lot of it was about addiction. He was still a piece of shit but I didn’t ever doubt that he cared for his kids, despite his behavior. 

Like you said, the mask has a psychological impact on The Grabber. Some scenes it is frowning, sometimes is smiling, sometimes it’s half off. This, to me, is similar to how someone with addiction keeps appearances with those around them. 

Another thing that tipped me off was him owning two houses. He has two states in every aspect of his life. One where he did horrible things, and another where he tried to cover them up to keep up the “mask” so to speak. Which is why he acted so horrified when he was unmasked. Because it was the moment when he couldn’t control the outcome of his addiction. For the father it was drinking, for Max it was drugs, for The Grabber it was abduction. 

Maybe I’m looking too much into the addiction thing but as a former alcoholic I really resonated with Jeremy Davies’ character and that’s where my mind took the movie.",vjd5ge

if6ny6f,">  It’s kind of a dark ending IMO, because they aren’t really out of the woods yet, but the kids have more confidence now and know they can get through it.

There's clearly character development on Finn's side - he's gone from someone who avoids conflict and tries to hide from it into a fighter who's ready to face challenges head-on.  This is reflected in several ways, like his ignoring of all the whispers in the hallway, his confidence when addressing his crush.

It's clear that, at some point in the future, he's going to take this new side of him and face his abusive father with it, if not for his sake, then for his sister's.",vjd5ge
idxfitb,"Eh, yeah but I felt like it was still a bit incongruent with the idea that the grabber had gone out of his way to soundproof the basement, and reinforce the window, attach that mattress to the floor, install the heavy locking door, etc. That seems like someone who has an obsessive attention to detail and planning.

If someone who has the time and attention to plan and do all that stuff, it seems like they wouldn't necessarily just stop caring about maintaining it all once they get their victim. It wouldn't take hardly any effort to look around the room for 2 seconds and notice the window grate is gone, the carpets have been moved, the floor is dug up, etc... like c'mon.

He also presumably had time to inspect the room between the time he killed the victims and was looking for his next one. I thought it  was interesting he didn't notice the code to the lock had been carved into the wall, didn't bother to reinforce the flooring where the previous kid tried to dig a hole, etc...

It didn't completely ruin the movie for me, but I just feel like a better writer could've gotten around those kind of sorta things in a more clever way.",vjd5ge

And I don't need every tiny thing explained, my issue is that the movie drops these tidbits that make it seem like its going to explain something. When it ended I had so many dangling questions in my head (why does the grabber hear the phone too, can anybody hear it? The boys were seemingly killed across the road, why is THIS room haunted, what's the connection between the houses? He wears different masks, what do they represent? Does he use them in his magic acts? Its not to mask his identity because he doesn't wear them during the kidnapping). Yes, the unknown works great for horror, but this was a thriller plain and simple. On a second viewing, now I know those things won't be explained, I can concentrate on other things and I'll probably enjoy it more.

1.	⁠It seemed like most of the kids where stuck in a loop . They repeat a lot of the same lines over and over until it starts making sense (almost like nellie in Hill House) i’m thinking because he stepped off the beaten path of the loop he was in he was pulled back
2.	⁠He was too angry. It seemed like each of the kids had a calmness about them not peace but just a calmness. It seemed to me he was the only one who was super angry and so once he started to get to rowdy he was called back. By who? i have no idea
3.	⁠It was finney mind trying to protect him. A lot of ppl with special abilities have the ability to put a wall up to protect themselves and when vance started to get to aggressive finney mind put up a wall.

ielxokg,"This is true, and definitely one of the pitfalls of this movie. Nothing got enough explanation. The father was abusive, but also loved his kids and felt bad? Why was he so angry? What is their history? Was the mom really insane or were her dreams also real like the daughters? If so, why did she kill herself? Was the dad nice before the mom died? Why was the grabber doing what he was doing? Why wasnt the brother as messed up as the grabber? Why could the dead kids call on the phone? Why could they each only call once? Where were their souls being trapped, because it was clear that they were in a purgatory for some reason, so what caused that? Why was only our main boy able to hear the phone and answer while the rest of the boys who came before seemingly were on their own? I could go on and on.

if05r36,"Yes, they did try to explain the abuse from the father as a coping mechanism with the loss of the wife, however, perhaps its just me, but the beating really made him irredeemable in my eyes, and i assume, in other audience members eyes in 2022.  

But maybe im just being sensitive. I guess kids got beaten like crazy by their parents in different times in our country.


That said, as soon as i saw the real antagonist with the belt, i jumped to the conclusion that the grabber was a figment of finns mind to explain the abuse really brought about by the  father, a truth that was too painful for finn to admit. 
Like the scene in “the neon demon” where elle fannings character is clearly being raped by keanu reeves character, but it isnt shown on screen. Instead it shows Elle fannings character listening to the sounds of the attack/rape from her hotel room as if its happening to someone else in the adjacent room instead of the harsh truth that its happening to her, something her brain is protecting her from fully realizing. 

But thats not how it went; im disappointed that its meant to be taken for face value.


Edit. Hmmm, maybe thats not how it went in the neon demon either! Maybe thats just what my friend suggested when we were watching it together and i jumped to THAT conclusion. Sorry, ill try to get my thoughts together some day",vjd5ge

iigtzsv,"So this was awhile since I saw it but at the beginning of the film the grabber says he heard that phone ring sometimes and says could be some phantom connection. My theory is that the kids were calling it to speak with the grabber but he never picked up, so they said the same lines twice, one time was intended for the grabber and the other intended for the kid, or maybe connections were messed up and those lines were always for the grabber.

For example; the Asian kid said in his phone call with the kid ‘that arm is mint’’, he said it twice I think. At the end when the phone is bashed against the grabber you hear the Asian kid say ‘that arm is Mint’ to the grabber thru the phone, like saying his arm is gonna fuck you up",vjd5ge

Across King and Hill's books and stories, so many people have abilities. It's not always called the Shine but the sentiment is there.",vjd5ge

idvqsnu,"Easy there, I’m not claiming anything, just offering a theory on the movie, not real life.  There’s a very clear parallel between the kids being beaten with a belt by their alcoholic father, and the Grabber beating his victims with a belt if they’re “naughty”.  It’s apparent the Grabber experiences something like that in his childhood.  That can be taken further to assume it’s related to why they can both hear the phone, but it’s just a theory.",vjd5ge

I didn't need to see how he was abused in 6th grade or whatever, but some kind of explanation for e.g. the mask, the punishment fixation, his connection to the phone, etc. would have gone a long way.

We know their bodies were dumped across the road, that's why the sister was drawn to that house. Their bodies were there. We don't know that they were killed there and seems unlikely that they were since the Grabber was down to kill Finn in the basement

>He wears different masks, what do they represent?

Nothing and that's okay! He wanted part of his face covered while he does these acts. He was wearing white paint when he kidnapped Finn, so maybe that counted as a mask

I mean, I guess they could have pointed her to the home within the first ten minutes and call it a day, but it’s a movie and Finn not being brave was made very clear from the start, by the end, he’s braver and willing to stand up for himself. That was his development with the ghosts. The sister could had some more time, but it seems like the spirits just wanted her to find their bodies which is probably the reason they point her directly to where they’re buried. The movie fakes you out to make you think they’re leading her to Finn. That aside, spirits wanting their corpses found so they can rest has been a thing in film and story for as long as I remember, so not sure why that’s considered pointless. The spirits leading her to the house the police had already checked out once with the cops would have detracted from Finn’s whole experience.

igdqrtb,"- The father was abusive, but also loved his kids and felt bad? Why was he so angry? What is their history? Was the mom really insane or were her dreams also real like the daughters? If so, why did she kill herself? Was the dad nice before the mom died? Why was the grabber doing what he was doing? -

This is only my interpretation of the story and I had those questions too while watching the movie. The way I see it is that the father became an alcoholic after the mom died. It can be very traumatic for someone to lose their loved one through suicide and that can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as alcoholism and physical/mental abuse of family members. He wanted to numb himself so he succumbed to alcohol and blamed everything on the fact that the reason his wife died is because of her dreams so whenever his kids would mention anything about their dreams, he beat them. He said at some point to one of his kids that he doesn’t want her to end up like their mom meaning he doesn’t want her to end up killing herself. Also, alcoholism is a very complex chronic disease, you can love someone yet do horrible things to them when you’re drunk.

The mom dreaming could be real and she probably just couldn’t take it anymore (maybe dreaming about horrifying things such as murders and stuffs) so she killed herself.


- Why wasnt the brother as messed up as the grabber? -

I would say the brother is pretty messed up too due to his obsession with the kidnapping case and his cocaine addiction. I’m assuming both the Grabber and him were abused at such a young age based on what the Grabber said to Finn that he used to stay in the basement too. Some people deals with trauma in different ways. I’m just gonna assume that the Grabber was older and thus was abused longer and probably harsher and snapped and finally went insane.

- Why could the dead kids call on the phone? Why could they each only call once? Where were their souls being trapped, because it was clear that they were in a purgatory for some reason, so what caused that? Why was only our main boy able to hear the phone and answer while the rest of the boys who came before seemingly were on their own? -

Why is Finn’s sister the only one who has the ability to dream of what happened? What about the other kids in school or town? I think Finn can hear the voices on the phone because of the same reason why his sister has those dreams. They inherited it from their mom. I just try to see it as something like where other people can see ghosts but others cannot. Or I also take it as something like “The Shining” by Stephen King.",vjd5ge

Family A moved away from your new house

A different day you moved into your new house

A different day later Family B moved into your old house

Because honestly I don't see the grabber taking/tricking him easily, and I don't see him cooperating with him long enough to survive.

They probably realized Finn, just as his sister and others have theorized the Grabber, to have some supernatural ability as he could hear the Black phone/interact with the ghosts of deceased. They sent him small encrypted messages both as different pathways to escape and also encouragement as they could sense his power to communicate, unknown to Finn, that it was motivating him that the the Grabber would die at the hands of Finn (himself).",vjd5ge

idtfv18,"I, too, am curious about the pulsating (it wasn’t “breathing” initially, just kind of expanding and contracting) phone.. it’s been bothering me trying to figure it out since I saw it. My best theory is that maybe, while there was clearly some basis in the reality we all know, that it’s some sort of hallucination after all (if you’ve taken psychedelics, you know that doesn’t mean it’s not necessarily real).. whether it was the drugs the grabber gave him, or just his “imagination” (some sort of schizophrenia in his family). Sometimes when you stare at things too long they move that way and things start to look and feel weird. Maybe that was just the visual way to ground it in reality? Your mind can go to some extreme places under that kind of duress, especially if you’ve been given some sort of hallucinogen, and/or are predisposed to that sort of thing. Granted, it might not be this deep, but it struck me as being more important/symbolic than just “the phone is alive” or something lol. I thought they did a great job trying to explore the intersections of these alternate realities. I’m aware that the grabber can hear it too, but he’s also inextricably tied to these kids and that place, and is also obviously not mentally stable lol. All told, I don’t know if the phone and the conversations were real, but it was a way to show that we can interact with alternate realities when pushed to our mental and physical limits, and they just used the phone to dumb it down. I’d like to think Finn came up with his methods of escape by tapping into his own cleverness and interacting with some sort of collective consciousness to draw the inspiration.",vjd5ge

“It’s 1952 Halloween Night, the grabber (as a child) is being beaten mercilessly by his father for being a ‘naughty boy’, blood is streaming down his face, a knock at the door, ‘go get it’ his father growls, the grabber gets the door, the trick or treater is wearing the mask he has in the film (as an adult) ‘cool costume’ the trick or treater says to the grabber as the blood streams down the child’s face, the black phone rings from the basement.”


Like any explanation is kind of insulting. The grabber is one of the worst thing’s inherently, a child killer, what do we really need to know about him. The story is about Finn overcoming not why the grabber is the way he is.",vjd5ge
igeqb8v,Yes. My feelings exactly. Not sure why the creatives thought it wasn’t needed. It absolutely was.,vjd5ge
ier9cfw,"I added to my comment. The studio after test screenings said the movie was fantastic, but they asked if he could film some background scenes of the Grabber to give you insight on who he was. And he declined. I do agree that someday they might make a prequel. Derrickson did said he has a great idea for a sequel and would like to collab with Hill on it.",vjd5ge
igl956u,"Yes I also felt like it alluded to the Grabber being held in that basement as a child. I personally felt like the Grabber, himself, had a drunk abusive father who would beat him with a belt and the Grabber was most likely abused by another adult he trusted. He also calls Finney “Johnny” when he first kidnaps him - promising with a “scout’s honor”- offering the soda afterwards. Is “Johnny” the Grabber’s actual name ? Feel like  the Grabber disassociated himself as a child with the abuse he experienced hence becoming this multi personality abuser himself.",vjd5ge

He never considered a ghost would give Finn the combo.  When the basement was locked, he would have put the lock away because yeah,, his brother would have definitely found that suspicious. 

What I don't get is that if finn came up there and the grabber started beating him, it definitely would have woken the bro up.  He woke up from the chase with the van and the grabber just blamed it on the dog.",vjd5ge

ilhwtub,SUCH a creepy and interesting hint when he brought the dog down.  I bet when he got them bleeding out he let the dog go nuts and finish them off.

I just feel like grabber wouldn't have had an easy time tricking him or grabbing, even fin managed to hurt the grabber, hence ""today's the day!!"".
That and I don't see him lasting long in the cellar, without much of a fight, he'd be too difficult to keep around, and I don't see him just obeying, so he probably got thrown down there after the break in, then immediately began trying to destroy the walls, this pissed the grabber off, so he just would have killed him right then.",vjd5ge

iie64oc,"Oh man. About 15 to 20 minutes into the actual movie starting, about 6 women ambled into the theater noisily and went up to one of the top rows to sit. 

For the first minute they were loud whispering and giggling and generally being assholes, so I finally loudly shushed them during a quiet moment, and then they all started to shush each other and actually quite down more after that. 

I don't know if they just didn't know how loud they were or what, but it was really fucking annoying, especially in a horror movie. 

One of them even laughed at an inappropriate time, and my blood was boiling. Thankfully they calmed down after.",vjd5ge

ikavuk2,"First scream movie. Yeah you said the tv show copied the saw movies, and I told it didn’t, it’s an idea from the original film",vjd5ge
iehcsh6,"It's a short story, but it's very good.  The Grabber is very physically different, but pretty much everything that's in the movie is in the short story.  The movie adds all of the backstory for the victims to fill out the runtime vs. just presenting what is in the book. The whole collection it is in is great.  I saw they just put out a new edition now called ""Black Phone Stories"" rather than ""20th Century Ghosts"".",vjd5ge
irles5h,In the movie… in the book Hallorann survives and helps Danny and his mom escape.,vjd5ge
ign84ym,"Thanks for the recommendation! Adding it to my list. I’ll have to check out Joe Hill’s work, too. Cool that he doesn’t try to coast on the King last name.",vjd5ge
idrqjba,"I was curious about the same thing. There were some nods to King's books like Finn's sister in the yellow jacket in the rain, or the shot of The Grabber holding the balloons like Pennywise. But then I started to wonder if the dog was supposed to evoke Cujo or the bullies were to remind us of Bowers from IT or Ace in The Body.",vjd5ge

Since the grabber could hear the phone ring, I believe the dead kids used it as a way to communicate. Like the bottle.",vjd5ge

idzl5yj,Hey man if you liked it that's great. Opinions and all that. That's what I got from it.,vjd5ge
ie1m3j9,Yea definitely but regardless if the film is paranormal or not the supernatural aspect shouldn't serve as a crutch to help the protagonist out of his situation. He needs to be able to get out that situation on his own. Getting help from external forces just dilutes his entire predicament.,vjd5ge

ie32xui,"We don’t have noodle necks. That’s why people need to get dropped to be hanged. It takes a lot of force to overcome a neck trying to snap unsnapped. 
Not a knock against the movie, but I definitely count that maneuver as unrealistic.",vjd5ge
idzju9k,Not completely but they did tone it down a lot. There were a couple times they loud whispered but it was more sparse and not full on conversations like they did before,vjd5ge
iea4jv6,What part of that story sounds like it would be fake? People get angry when you talk constantly in the theater. It’s not like a “and everyone clapped” the couple and everyone else got awkward but they didn’t talk the rest of the movie so that’s a win.,vjd5ge
igcq4hq,I agree she deserves an award for that scene,vjd5ge
igfqdue,Sure,vjd5ge
igcjniz,Okay yeah that was the part where I was amazed by she out acted both Vetren actor Jeremy Davis and Mason Thames in that scene but the rest of time she was cringe and bad,vjd5ge

ihfa78n,"Maybe, maybe not!",vjd5ge
igf99nn,"Hmmm. I guess maybe. It doesn't seem like a sure thing that they'd search the other house...hell they almost didn't even notice the basement in the second house, so the cops in this universe aren't exactly the smartest on the block.",vjd5ge

igk81as,The ending that showed there was two houses across from each other.,vjd5ge
idzl95n,That’s fine but also I think you need to work on your media literacy skills a bit,vjd5ge
ie1nso5,"I disagree. Protagonists get help all the time. Brody doesn’t kill the shark without Quint’s help getting there. Luke Skywalker doesn’t become a Jedi without Obi-Wan and Yoda guiding him. Laurie Strode gets killed by Michael Myers if not for Dr. Loomis. Dorothy never defeats the Witch without the help of her friends. There’s not shame in receiving some guidance, at the end of the day our protagonist still has to apply what they’ve learned and been given, and use those things to come out victorious.",vjd5ge

ie1xutt,"You're not understanding. In those situations the characters were in an environment that help was nearby along with other characters working towards the same goal. In this film, by all accounts, he was supposed to be alone in that room. No outside characters to help him. But when you just magically write in that the previous victims are calling you on a phone to help you get out of your situation, that's bullshit, sir. That's a cop out. That's lazy writing. That's not the reality in a real world situation. Which is the tone and environment the filmmaker set up in the beginning. A real world threat where kids are being kidnapped and killed. This is a real world fear that no longer becomes as dire when your receiving help from the unknown. I mean cmon.",vjd5ge

ie3f4h3,"Yeah and I balance it out with wathh chi inf tons of independent films and foreign movies and classics so your point is moot.

Also you’re an NBA stan, so idk how much I trust someone whose entertainment is watching a bunch of grown men play with a rubber ball",vjd5ge
ie1zyeq,"Once again, you want a different film. It was always clear from the trailers that this is a supernatural film about communicating with ghosts via the titular black phone. It is a ghost story at its core. It’s not a “real world” story, it’s a work of fiction. You not liking the genre does not make it “lazy writing.” 

You’re totally entitled to not like the direction they took with this movie, but accusing it of being lazy is just ignorant. Just say you don’t like ghost stories and prefer more “realistic” thrillers. You’re entitled to your preference, but this movie was never designed to be the thing you’re asking for and it’s unreasonable to try and levy these accusations at it for that. That’s like if I watched Rent and got mad that they started singing because I wanted a more realistic story about the AIDS crisis in the city. You can dislike a genre, but you can’t just fault the movie for its genre.",vjd5ge

igkpsu6,"Dude, at the end of the movie the police went into the 2nd house and it was 100% empty. 

In every scene that we see the brother and the grabber in the houses there's furniture around them.

Also, when the boy escapes and is brought back, we can hear the brother wake up asking what the noise is, and the grabber tells him to go back to sleep.

Also, when the brother looks at his board and realized it was him, he didn't leave the house, he just walked into the kitchen and walked into the basement

They were in the same house.",vjd5ge
iiaf5wb,"They were in the same house.

The house where Finn is kept hostage is the 1242 one, IIRC. House 7741 (again, IIRC), was used solely for burying the dead kids.

They are in the same house the whole time, divided by a door. They split the house in two, basically. Max was probably too afraid of The Grabber to do anything, but he was into investigating stuff while coked out of his mind.

There's also the lock scene, where Max wakes up and The Grabber says Samson was barking at something.",vjd5ge
idzmsf9,I've seen Room. That's not what this movie could have been.,vjd5ge
ie21re7,Yea ok I can agree with that. And I know it was based on a short story and the filmmaker was just following that blueprint. But yea. I mean I like some ghost stories but not the ones where they come in just to help the main character out of dead ends. Just feels too easy.,vjd5ge
iggrguv,Yeah I honestly believe with her and her parents consent and okay they had to actually hit with her once with it there is no way in my mind someone can fake such raw emotion from being scared and then defiant by not actually being hit by so I honestly think she was struck with it once,vjd5ge

igksczj,"So, how did the boy run out from the empty house if they were in the same house. Different house.",vjd5ge
idzn0tf,"It’s exactly what you’re saying you wanted. 
You wanted a character trapped in a basement, with no ghosts, no sister with special senses, the main character to have no special senses.",vjd5ge
igltvnn,"Thank you dude, that's perfect!",vjd5ge
igljka5,"The boy never ran out from an empty house. It always showed items in the house (where his brother also lived). Here are screenshots from both times he left. You can see items in the background of the second photo, which is from the end of the movie.

Also, the Grabber’s house doesn’t have a fence. The empty house has a fence in front. Fin comes from the grabber’s/Max’s house at the end. I just watched and my girlfriend and I were going over the same questions haha. Here’s a pic of him coming out of the house without a fence (as his sister sits in front of the fence across the street at the empty house):
