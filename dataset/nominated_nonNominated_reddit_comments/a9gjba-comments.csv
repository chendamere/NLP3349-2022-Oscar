edw7hgr,"The part about Dick's heart being healthier than ever and how they're out of politics and raising labrador retrievers made me laugh out loud, the swelling music was brilliant",a9gjba
ecjbz2z,"Thought this was good. All of them were perfect in their portrayals, except maybe Steve Carrell. Moreso as he has a very distinct look/voice so I saw it less as Rumsfeld and more of an older version of Carrell himself, but that's more on me than him I suppose, he did great in the role overall. I liked the fakeout credits and when they went Shakespearean.",a9gjba
ecq6e87,"The most annoying thing in this movie is the narrative structure. McKay doesn't let scenes play out on their own. Jesse Plemons' narration keeps butting in most of the time or it cuts to something else. Quite frankly, it made me feel annoyed and patronized. Annoyed because I'm trying to watch a movie and I feel like someone is just trying to talk over it. Patronized because I feel like the movie is too scared to lose people so they have to keep the movie fresh by shoving 14 graphics in your face every 5 minutes. 

Where it really lost me was when Cheney was mulling over the idea of being VP while using mouthwash. And the movie cuts in between lines of dialogue to say ""What was Dick Cheney thinking that day?"" And other stuff. It felt like I was being read a Dr. Suess book. 

I understand that this is McKays style in The Big Short too but it worked in The Big Short. It just doesn't work here because he does it way too much. ",a9gjba
ecl022b,"Aside from the weird editing, I think the biggest problem with the film is McKay’s approach. 

It’s somehow both patronising and not dumbed down enough. It speaks down to the audience about the basics but dedicates all of a few seconds to far more complex topics. The unitary executive theory for example. The film spends at least 15 minutes explaining and re-explaining that, when it’s really not hard to grasp. Meanwhile Cheney’s entire motivation for Iraq is explained with a 5 second shot of a map of oil fields and a 20 second conversation about Halliburton’s billing practices. That’s fine for people who know their recent history, but those same people don’t need the concept of Presidential executive power hammered home two dozen times. I’m not sure who this movie was meant for.

It’s like if The Big Short spent 15 minutes explaining what a mortgage is and only 30 seconds explaining mortgage-backed securities.",a9gjba
ecj3l03,"I mean, a good portion of the movie takes place after the credits...

I enjoyed it, but not as much as I had expected to with those involved. Funny, but not hilarious. Interesting, but not super revealing. I know there's some criticism that Bale is just doing an impersonation but I think I prefer that for the lead than let's say what Carrell did for this type of movie.

eclg8dw,"I liked it. Emphasis on like. It was interesting, Bale was great, I thought it was well written. That said...

The editing was all over the place. All the intercut shots were just not well done. The fishing cuts in the scene when he’s negotiating with W. Bush were great, but I can’t think of any others that made as much sense as that one. 

I understand the teacup analogy and what they were getting at with modern executive power but it felt unfinished.

ecjloro,"I enjoyed it but I don’t think it comes close to The Big Short. Some funny bits like the mid movie credits, the Shakespeare scene, and the way Cheney reacts to his heart attacks. Bale was incredible as expected but I thought Rockwell was a bit over the top and Carell was out of place. A lot of the film also felt oversimplified since it was so scattered and they tried to get in as many topics as possible (energy, Fox News, corporate taxes, etc.). Just came off kinda preachy at some points even though I agreed with just about everything McKay was trying to say.
",a9gjba
eda3xnr,"I just saw the movie, and while I agree with some of the criticisms, I also really enjoyed the film. 

Something that really stood out to me is how Cheney’s main point of redemption throughout is his acceptance of his daughter being gay and refusal to speak out against gay marriage. I think ending the movie on him and Lynne giving approval to Liz to run against gay marriage was excellent and really got at the heart of the idea that, while Cheney is certainly a complex leader,  at the end of the day he wanted power and was prepared to do anything to keep it.

ecj2lrv,"Christian Bale was absolutely great in this one. His portrayal of Chaney is classic and he accurately depicted the quintessential neo con mentality.

Idk if he will get a nomination for this.",a9gjba
ecjsjw4,"I definitely enjoyed the film and I think it really presented the information in a very entertaining fashion. I felt like the tone shifted a lot and that left me a bit jarred at certain points, but Christian Bale nails the role and had me invested.

I kind of wanted more Bush and Cheney interactions, but I know the movie had a lot to cover.

Overall, worth the watch if you liked The Big Short and are interested about the subject imo.",a9gjba
eckol0u,"Movie felt like a House of Cards episode, which is scary considering this shit actually happened.",a9gjba
ecn141l,"Starting with the easy, the performances were all really great. Especially liked Amy Adams. 

I think the main issue I had with this movie was Adam Mckay's (the director) style/approach. The mixing of real footage, photos, news clips, etc. right into the regular narrative can work really well, as it did in *The Big Short* (Mckay's other movie.) However, *The Big Short* was about the housing market crash -- the movie was trying to explain an event, and news clips/real footage really lends itself well to explaining things and giving credibility to the narrative. This style works well with ideas or events as the main focus of the movie, but doesn't work when the movie is supposed to be a character drama/study, in the case of Vice. I wanted to see a ruthless Dick Cheney slowly gaining power in the white house. Instead we got a buffet of random Dick Cheney moments at different points in his life and reactionary news clip footage, with an awkward voiceover filling in gaps. 

**TL;DR** The style doesn't work for the subject matter, but the movie is entertaining with good performances. 5/10. ",a9gjba
ecj7ar5,"Just got out of the theater over an hour ago, loved it. It had a VERY inconsistent tone, but it was confident in it because that is what the story necessitated. The truth is often messy; events can be both grim and hilarious, as they were with Cheney’s string pulling in his political career. It is hard to make a riveting, tonally constant film about a man with zero moral convictions. I think this film did exactly what it needed to do to pull it off. It doesn’t take the lazy route of just joking and ridiculing everything about him in the vein of The Big Short. I highly recommend that you see this film.",a9gjba

ecuvaty,"Disclaimer, 26. Was 8 when most of this stuff happened so frankly a bunch of this is new to me

This was not a fun watch. Mostly in the way that I was sickened by the conniving bullshit peddled by all these people.

The performances rocked my world though. Bale and Adams of course and honestly Molina was a fun surprise bit part.

I love the meta, in your face editing style transposed from the big short.

Only level I feel let down really is I walked out struggling to understand Cheney’s psyche in any way. But maybe that’s the point. I wanted a deeper understanding of principles etc but the first thing the film says is “he’s insanely private and we did our best”

Movie is pretty good but as a late millennial the most rewarding part was feeling like I actually learned things, as unhappy as I was to learn them ",a9gjba

edo0x3h,"I think the film's biggest problem was that it tried to be too many things; an in-depth biopic that explored Cheney's relationship with his family, a satirical expose of the absurdity of various presidential administrations, or just an out-and-out recount of what went on after 9/11, devoid of any character or story developments whatsoever.

I'll also add that, as with the Margot Robbie scene in The Big Short (I'm glad to see that this film is getting the reception that that film deserved) I found myself rolling my eyes at most of those ""artistic"" flourishes, like the Shakespeare scene or the menu ordering part. They just felt like McCay attempts at being clever, without being particularly effective or funny.",a9gjba
eckwozr,"I certainly enjoyed myself while watching (about 2 hours ago, in fact) but settled down I realise it could have been better written, for sure. Tried to do too many things in one movie. I admire many aspects of the film, the performances, a lot of the visuals, the humour... It’s a shame. 

I found Lynne Cheney’s story and character super fascinating though. Amy Adams is exceptional (as per usual)

I had some of the same issues with The Big Short, although I thought that was a much better film, so I'll just avoid McKay's dramas from here on. 

Even though Carrell's performance was great, I couldn't help but think of Rumsfeld as a kind of evil version of Michael Scott. ",a9gjba
efbk40x,"Seems like Cheney has done some interviews since 2008. Has he ever expressed remorse for the 600,000 Iraqis killed in the wake of the Iraq War?",a9gjba
egevna8,"I thought it was awful. Mismatched tone, barely a tracking story, a shitty and contrived narration that came out of nowhere, and flipping around to so many times and vignettes that it’s hard to focus on a story. It feels like the entire movie was just the trailer for Vice, and I keep expecting McKay to be like “gotcha” and give us the actual movie. It’s a shame, too, because the cast is...... okay? While I don’t blame this on the actors, they barely got a chance to show their chops. While I understand that Cheney was fairly emotionless, he is portrayed as a robot. Lynne is good acting by Amy Adams, but she barely gets any lines, and Rumsfeld is literally just Steve Carell being Steve Carell. Jesse Plemons is, in my opinion, the best actor in the film, but still never gets a chance to do anything, is the wrong choice for his part, and I do detest that he’s even there.

Also, we never really go behind the scenes of the really bad stuff that Cheney did- in fact we never go behind the scenes at all. We never even see him start his company. It’s all told to us, by a contrived narration. Everybody knows that the first rule of film school is Show, don’t Tell, and McKay apparently was absent that day.

eckf3xg,So how was Rockwell? Haven’t really read much about his performance on here.,a9gjba
ectyag6,"Something that surprised me was that I didn’t get the “it doesn’t know what it wants to do” vibe. To me it was very clear in it’s intent and message: it wants you to feel that Dick Cheney and his company were terribly abusive, corrupt people that did anything to move themselves up, and in turn affected the world in an extremely negative way. I know this is a very biased film, and so doing some more research/getting another side of the story would moderate my view a bit, but I think a sign that the movie achieved it’s goal was that I feel like I have no answer to it. Feels like a horribly cynical, depressing look at the reality of American and world history, and the problems America has, and when I came out of the theater, I was in a “man, Rage Against The Machine really has a point...” mood. ",a9gjba
edm49lo,"I'm glad they went into detail about who all the players were in the bush administration that promoted the Iraq war besides Cheney and perhaps Rumsfeld. Really drives home the point that Cheney was the ultimate DC insider/bureaucrat, and was willing to bend the constitution to his vision. Abused his office, corrupted the presidency and didn't give a shit. Fuck that guy.

Great performances across the board by the whole cast.

Edit: If you are a Trump supporter, you will probably want to duck out at the end of the film right when the credits roll.

edr6doq,"Really liked Bale in this, he did a phenomenal job. 

A lot of times I felt like I was being beat in the face when the director thought he was being subtle. 

This movie is 30 minutes shorter if you cut out stock footage, which really should've happened because it was WAY overused. I truly don't need 3 minutes of a fishing line and finally the line going tight just to illustrate someone took the bait. Alot of this shit was WAY too on the nose. 

I think the director got too cute with this one, especially considering the consequences. The Big Short felt so much heavier and more impactful than this, and it shouldn't. All the cut scenes in The Big Short advanced either the story or the viewers understanding of the story. The cut scenes in this are just....weird and happen way too often. 

Oh the aging makeup in this movie is so good. Amy Adams in particular. Usually it looks kind of awkward but this was flawless. That going to the hospital gag recurring had me cracking up too. ",a9gjba
ecumzcm,"I really wish they hadn’t spent half the movie giving his backstory. It wasn’t informative at all and moved too fast to feel attached to it. I know the credits in the middle were a nice touch but come on. The best parts were clearly the ones that took place during the bush Whitehouse. I would’ve liked a way more comprehensive look at dick Cheney from 2000 to 2008. 

Bale, Perry, and Rockwell were fantastic. Carrell was good but as others have pointed out he was a little too jolly and fun to really be hated. The real Rumsfeld is vile and much easier to hate. 

Edit: if nothing else the film should’ve been like 3 hours long or a short miniseries (like someone in this thread said). McKay clearly did his research but tried to stuff it all into two hours. ",a9gjba
ed9ag4o,"I feel this had the potential to be the best film of the year if it was made as a straight bio-pic.

10/10 performances from everyone.",a9gjba
ee66sxj,"It's hard for me to describe how I feel about this movie. In the end I liked it more than I didn't, but it felt like there were things that kept me at an arms length from fully getting into it, whether it was the pacing, story or whatever. Overall, it was a bit hit-or-miss but managed to hit more than it missed. 

That mid-credits with the focus group was a huge swing and miss for me - you're probably supposed to cringe (I think?) but it kind of felt like a cheap shot to use F&F as the example of 'mindless entertainment' when Adam McKay happens to also be the director or producer of equally mindless entertainment himself.",a9gjba
ee6iaq2,"I thought that it was interesting that McKay devoted so much time to the topic of Mary Cheney’s sexuality, but did not include how Kerry/Edwards tried to use that against the 2004 Bush campaign.

ecx3qn5,"**Pros**:

* Bale's performance was solid. He can be a tremendously funny in an understated way, which isn't something I'd expect from him. Tremendously PHYSICAL performance -- reminded me a lot of James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, who ""carried"" his darkness as the story went on.
* Steve Carell. Who would have thought he would put on the most nuanced performance in the whole film? His Rumsfeld belonged in a much better movie.
* There were a few good moments of clarity. The mid-film credits scene was genuinely funny.

**Cons**:

* I'll echo what others said: Vice has no idea what it wants to be. At times heavy and emotional, at other moments it's a satirical, quasi-mockumentary. The two halves not only don't fit, it almost feels like McKay didn't even try.
* What is McKay's actual opinion of who Dick Cheney IS? It's obviously that he doesn't agree with Cheney's politics or his actions, and that's fine, but he can't seem to settle on a thesis for the movie beyond ""Dick Cheney = bad"". The film starts with Cheney as a drunken good ol' boy who is slow and stupid to the point of being nearly mute. Flash-forward a few scenes and he's suddenly a Machiavellian political genius and CEO. It's baffling.
* In it's eagerness to skip to every Cheney sin as quickly as possible (invading Iraq! Gutting environmental protections! Creating FOX News! Consolidating power in the executive!) it settles none of them. Make a movie about Iraq. Or make a movie about what it actually means to focus power within the Oval Office. But it treats all of these as given, and hurries to the next thing before the movie has resolved the previous thing.
* The film is in search of some kind of unifying through-line. The closest thing it has is the friendship between Cheney and Rumsfeld. But it's also: the Cheneys' marriage, his DUI from his 20s, his desire to prove himself, his relationship with his daughter, etc. Ultimately, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to care about in this film.
* One small, mostly personal point: They treated the Mary Cheney LGBT storyline in a cheap way. It was a humanizing element to the Dick Cheney persona that was played up in the final 15 minutes for some easy drama.
* The end-credit epilogue lines about deaths in Iraq and Mary/Liz's relationship went on way too long. It's obviously supposed to be a sobering moment, but it mostly felt lazy.",a9gjba

Cheney is a scumbag, but they pretty much took every big player's worst traits and cranked them up to 11. Made Bush look nothing more than an actual idiot, made Rumsfeld seems completely insane, and made Cheney seem like satan himself.

In the middle of the movie the director thought it would be fitting to start rolling the credits as if the movie was over, I felt it was lazy and they could have found a more creative way to transition Dick from family man to politician once again. Also confusing was in the beginning, it felt like they were trying to portray Dick as a hero who over came his bumpy start (Dui's, Kicked out of Yale, etc). Then by the end of the movie it felt like they were purposely trying to portray Dick as a selfish asshole. I came away not knowing if that movie was supposed to be honoring him or not. 6.5/10",a9gjba

eh5tyzu,"I ""saw"" this godawful movie today as part of a Best Picture nominee marathon and I hated it. I'm putting ""saw"" in quotation marks because I walked out halfway through, the only time I've ever walked out of a movie. It took everything I disliked about The Big Short and dialed it up to 11: the self-righteous and condescending tone, the way that anyone McKay dislikes or disagrees with is depicted as pure evil, the way that McKay is telling the audience what to think instead of making them think, the attempts at witty humor that just come off as awkward and cringeworthy, the fact that it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, the seizure-inducing editing, and so on. It felt like this movie was flipping off the audience the entire runtime. I've honestly seen movies [about](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/) [Hitler](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4176826/) that portray him more sympathetically than Vice portrayed Cheney.

The only reasons I gave this movie a 2/10 instead of a 0 are Bale's and Carell's performances, and the impressive makeup work.

I can see how some may have wanted the begging to be cut shorter, but I would rather have all those beginning scenes in their then not. Overall, I loved it (though I would expect it to have a much more niche fan base than the big short).

ecz8s98,"I highly anticipated this movie, and while it generally succeeds at delivering a big-budget overview of Cheney's career and its key moments, there are some pretty serious flaws. It does a wayyyyy better job at delivering that 2000s, Iraq War era feel than *Shock and Awe*, but it's not difficult to see why this movie leaves a bad taste in peoples' mouths. It's also too long, and tries to focus on too many things utilizing too many emotional tones. 

*VICE* feels like a love child of *The Big Short*, in terms of its constantly breaking the fourth wall, and Brad Pitt's Afghanistan movie, *War Machine*, in terms of that movie's satirical nature. But *VICE* just goes too far with both of these styles, and its self awareness over time became obnoxious. For a movie that was surprisingly generous to Cheney on a personal level, it still felt too snarky and self satisfied. From its opening monologue, the film posits that ""regular people"" are just too stupid and distracted to understand who Cheney was or the extent of his damage. There's an undeniable condescension to it.  

As for the whole ""liberal bias"", that just can't be denied. It's literally touched upon in the film. Personally I don't think there's anything ""biased"" about depicting Cheney as a scheming, coldly pragmatic human being who led the US into Iraq for the wrong reasons, and is undeniably largely responsible for the death of countless thousands. That's just history. What makes the movie feel biased is its attitude and over dramatizations of conversations that no one technically has access to. It overly dramatizes people like Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, and George Bush Junior in a cartoonishly negative light, alongside many of their key discussions and decisions related to the Iraq War. Many of those scenes were unsubtle and poorly done, depicting key moments in an overly metaphorical, embellished fashion. Its heavy implication that Cheney is largely responsible for the rise of ISIS is just stupid, and ignores all sorts of historical and political variables that also facilitated their rise, many of which took place after he left office. It also tries too hard to root itself in the present, with images of things like the European migrant crisis and US opioid crisis, which are pretty big reaches when it comes to what Cheney is himself responsible for.

I was, by the way, willing to accept all of the above until the end of credits scene, in which the film breaks the fourth wall yet again and LITERALLY GOES OUT OF ITS WAY to characterize itself as based on facts alone, which is why people think it has a ""liberal bias,"" and its detractors are essentially just stupid Donald Trump supporters. I have never seen a movie do that before, and considering that anyone educated in the events it depicts knows it to be ahistorical, that was just insulting. Immediately left a bad taste in my mouth.

ed7k4pg,"Man I have such mixed opinions on the film ""Vice"", the Dick Cheney kinda sorta biopic/liberal lecture. 

- Christian Bale as Cheney is just phenomenal. His final monologue, in which Cheney makes his case for himself, is enthralling. 

- Great sparknotes version of the runup to the Iraq war. 

- The acting in general I saw as solid, except Carrell as Rumsfeld. That just felt like Michael Scott impersonating Donald Rumsfeld. Which is weird because his character in ""The Big Short"" did not feel that way at all.

- Speaking of The Big Short, this movie tried to do the cutesy creative cutaway scenes that film did (same writer or director I think) but it just didn't work here. It would have worked better as a straight biopic in my opinion. Let Bale do his thing. 

- As someone who despises the neocons, I gotta say, whenever the narrator comes in, this film is propaganda. It informs you what you should think, when the events could have spoken for themselves just fine. 

Particularly aggravating was all the pre-2000 stuff, which Cheney had a limited role in. The movie loves to paint the right wing and their big money donors as this giant evil conspiracy that has ruined America. If only they were beaten back, liberalism (in the current American sense, not the old definition) would make everything great! 

...except the American left and its big government, anti-Constitution bullshit is just as rotten to the core as the neocons. Hell, by expanding government so much, they paved the way for Cheney and his ilk to use it for their destructive wars and surveillance state. The movie cannot deal with the left's now half-century of consistent failure, so it turns Cheney into some comic book villain, when he is bad enough without the propaganda. 

The movie lost me fully on a minor point- in a montage, it cast Cheney as ""evil"" for voting against a ban on the then-new polymer pistols. The film repeated Die Hard 2's hollywood bullshit and claimed these guns, most famously Glocks, can get through metal detectors undetected. This is totally false, their barrels, bullets and several other parts are still metal. But the movie knew its target audience mostly would not know that.

While this would normally just induce an eyeroll from me and I'd let it go, in a movie so heavy on the leftist lecturing, it made me question everything it told me. If they were willing to lie about something so trivial, what else may they be lying about? 

A terrific fan edit of this movie where they spare us the leftist lecturing and just let the actors do their thing would be very welcome. The crimes and failures of the Neocons don't need to be spoon fed to us by condescending leftists, who are the other side of the same statist coin. 

6/10. Wasted potential.",a9gjba

I repeatedly forgot I was watching Bale and Adams, as they just became Mr and Mrs Cheney. It was funny without ever forcing anything.

1) At the beginning during the 9/11 panic where a bunch of phone calls were being made. I kind of missed some of the dialogue, but did Cheney tell Bush to keep the plane in the air, and also make the command to shot down any plane that was deemed to be a threat? Meaning, he was trying to set Bush up to be killed so that he would take over as president? I know that seems like a dumb question, but I lost focus for a second and kind of missed it. 

2) Was GWB really like Cheney's puppet? The movie portrays Bush as kind of an idiot and like he's being manipulated by Cheney at many important moments. Was this accurate? Or is it just how Chenney viewed him? I know Hollywood likes to tease W for being an idiot, but I am just curious how accurate this is. ",a9gjba

The movie was far from subtle.  They almost elbow you with some things that become an eye roll.  The end where everything is Cheney’s fault is awful.  The consistent elbowing of the viewer was just demeaning, “hey guys you can’t see there face but hear that it’s Enron” 

The narration wasn’t necessary and took you away from the story.  The whole tone of the movie felt off.   It wasn’t entertaining enough to be a dark comedy or whatever, and it wasn’t serious enough to be taken seriously.

ef8sb4k,"Entertaining. Decently historically accurate in terms of events, but the dialogue was obviously not accurate and the ending was at least largely supposition, if not outright fiction. The actors did a good job but the film was obviously a dramatized (or commedy-tized?) version of the events that actually took place. The film certainly was entertaining but it didn't follow a consistent timeline and it made it hard to follow. I'm also not sure what the point of having the random narrator be the heart-donor at the end. As far as I'm aware, it isn't public knowledge who the donor was and thus the supposition that the donor had been a veteran who served in the war that Cheney was largely responsible for is an unnecessary stretch considering how hatable he was anyway. Cheney only had a 13% approval rating when he left office; the only way he could've been more disliked is if he *was* congress. 

I'm not sure how to categorize this movie. It isn't a documentary but is at least partially intended to bring attention to the timeline of events and extreme amount of power Cheney had. It isn't really a comedy but has a lot of comedic moments. It is a drama, but doesn't really play like a typical drama. Overall I guess I'd rate it a 6.5/10. Worth watching once for sure, but it wasn't exactly Oscar worthy or anything. ",a9gjba

eebvxpc,"It was a bit too smug for its own good. This movie was neither fish nor fowl- they wanted to do a searing indictment of Cheney, but then undercut their own argument by inventing things or outright lying to get you to where they want to take the story (Cheney killed Jesse Plemons to get his heart! Cheney is directly responsible for Isis!)

Some things were just manipulative- such as the implication that Cheney lost his soul for good when he ""betrayed"" his daughter, but it somehow implies he had total Machiavellian control over the other one denouncing gay marriage. It also presented the same tired old portrayal of George W. as a hapless, bumbling puppet Cheney used, but it never gets at ""why"" he would do all this, other than a generic ""he wanted power"" plot, which is so overused at this point. I would've liked to seen a more ambiguous portrayal, such as the idea that people sometimes have good intentions (believing something is a threat with all your heart), but go about it in horrifying ways. This did neither, and was just kind of there, with the smarmy, overly cutesy fourth wall jokes. No one in on this seemed very intelligent, to be honest, and the after-credits scene was just insulting. While we were all apparently sitting around with our thumbs up our asses while Cheney destroyed the country, what was Adam McKay doing exactly, besides making his stupid comedy movies? The filmmakers had absolutely no high ground to come from but it was strangely condescending.

And it was beyond jarring to have such out-of-place stars as certain people (Rumsfeld was basically Michael Scott), but then the real Jimmy Carter, Nixon and Obama. I honestly could not not tell who Naomi Watts was supposed to be playing, I literally thought she was playing herself.",a9gjba
ecjkn2r,"I don’t know if I’ve ever walked out of a movie feeling like the director actively hated his audience, but oh boy did I with this one.

efmxjva," I’m a big fan of The Big Short, but if McKay plans to follow this “meta-narrative” route to build his trademark as a filmmaker, he needs to understand that the form itself is nothing without a poignant content. The Big Short used humor to approach its themes through unexpected and insightful ways. In Vice, the comedy is mostly a distraction. Most of the cutaway gags are predictable and many of the jokes fall flat.

This is a satire that comes not from perceptive observation, but from a sense of moral superiority of the filmmakers, that turn their subjects into one-dimensional assholes and drain any of the real-world complexities of politics from the story.

That would be acceptable (it’s okay for a film to not live up to its intentions). But at the end, Vice crosses a moral line that I find difficult to forgive: the “revelation” of the narrator as the organ donor. It suggests the donor’s actions saved the life of a despicable individual that the donor himself loathed (even though the character was there to translate McKay’s point). His death is used for comedic purposes. The movie implies: “if I knew my heart was going to Cheney, I’d choose to be buried with it”. The movie condemns Cheney for referring to the organ as his “new heart”. 

Vice’s intentions were clearly to paint Cheney as a morally rotten individual (can't argue against that!), but it didn’t need to resort to the same unscrupulous tactics. It’s appalling, offensive and disrespectful to use the man that lost his life as a plot device like that.",a9gjba
ecly8a3,"Decent movie, not as good as the big short though

The acting carries it, Bale kills this role. The cast all around is excellent, even a guy like Tyler Perry did well (not surprising, he was great in gone girl too). 

I will say that McKay’s style was not used as effectively here. I loved the funny cutaways and stock footage in big short, but this felt like a cheap attempt to replicate it. For a lack of a better term, the editing got a bit TOO cute at times if that makes sense

Also, Rockwell was great but he felt like he was in a different film. The other cast members were playing their roles straight (except for maybe Rummy), but Rockwell felt like he was doing an SNL sketch impersonation. He was funny but didn’t fit the rest of the vibe (I’m sure it was all true, but the skittles spread across his sloppy desk in their first meeting and the blank stares were just way to much of “look at how stupid this guy was!”)",a9gjba
ecpbhm2,"interesting reaction ITT

i got out of the movie almost exactly what I expected from it, visual gimmicks and all. that seems to be McKay's new style and I'm a fan of it, but some aren't. still, complaining that it happened seems a bit like complaining about a Wes Anderson movie being quirky. although, to be fair, Anderson's style is much more well defined.

also interesting to see people complaining about the post credits scene being preachy. i'm very liberal and i felt as though it was making fun of both guys there. the liberal guy calling trump ""cheeto"" or whatever came off as super whiny and I'm pretty sure that's the point.

thirdly, as a millenial, i can confidently say that *many* of my friends know nothing about dick cheney. so that opening bit about people not knowing him wasn't totally wrong.

ecu1lif,"A poorly executed passion project with too many darlings in dire need of killing. It felt like the entire project was under the gun from start to finish. The development stage of the narrative felt like it was half-assed, the time-jumps were jarring and their purposes were unclear, Jesse Plemons' character seemed present for less than half the story but when he narrated he spoke like he'd been along for the whole journey and the pay off for his character was unsatisfying and ineffective. The sarcastic credit roll in the middle was an unearned gag as I hadn't had the time to develop an opinion on Dick or his plot arc, it felt like it came before the movie had even made a complete thought. The timing of other gags like the Shakespeare-esque dialogue felt off, like there was no rapport established with the audience. The one good gag I can remember is the waiter one which was actually hilarious. 

Having seen *The Big Short* (and loving it) I can *see* what McKay was going for with most of his stylistic choices but he missed the mark consistently making for a garish, incoherent movie. Its like he couldn't decide on what brainchild of his he wanted to use so he used them all and clogged the narrative with his ""cleverness"".

The Unitary Executive Theory seemed like it was at the crux of Cheney's political legacy and yet it was never fleshed out in a way that was helpful to the audience. McKay explained what it was like one and a half times (for some reason?) and stopped there instead of going into *how* the theory was used or why it worked without significant legal backlash and why a president hadn't done it before. I imagine this was meant to explain the precedent the Bush administration was acting on during its time but I walked away unconvinced it was anything more than post-9/11 hysteria that paved the way for its extreme policies.

Acting was the lone saving grace of this movie. CB and AA were flawless as was what little we saw of Sam Rockwell. Carell was excellent as well and I wasn't convinced of that casting going in. Tyler Perry as Powell blew my mind. I had no clue he was in this movie and actually laughed when he came on screen but he immediately blended into his role so mad props to him.

Vice doesn't trust any of its scenes to get the point across, so it constantly interrupts with narration and cut away shots, but almost no actual information is conveyed here.

I know a lot of you don't like the ""lack of focus"" but they made a film about a fat old white guy walking around in a building barking orders to people exciting somehow. And Christian Bale is perfect. Like, forget the makeup department, who also did a fantastic job--Bale does the Cheney smirk nonstop with his face the whole time and it never looks forced. That's some dedicated acting. 

I went in knowing this was gonna be a hit piece. I'm not a Cheney fan by any means, and his leadership style was a terrible fit for the position he found himself in. Any accurate film about him is going to show a lot of really ugly truths. But I'm still gonna roll my eyes at any movie that depicts every Republican as a power-hungry dictator while every Democrat is just trying to do the right thing. The parts where they try and vilify conservative propaganda ring a bit hollow when your film is liberal propaganda.

I always tend to compare White House biopics to Oliver Stone ones. Oliver Stone is, of course, a conspiracy theorist with a personal agenda, and that comes out in his movies. He likes to represent every ugly rumor about every politician he hates as 100% true, as this film does, although it doesn't go off the deep end here. Many of those rumors about Dick Cheney are almost certainly true. There's a little conspiracy stuff (""Why would he be talking to his lawyer?!"" and leaving the audience with that riveting bombshell) but Dick really is nuts, that's not an embellishment. But what Oliver Stone was able to do in Nixon at least is make a human being out of him. Speculating about your political opponents' motives in bad faith isn't going to make a compelling character because cartoon villains aren't real. That's why the movie needed to focus so much on Lynne and his daughters, even if it's not about Iraq or whatever you went in there to see him taken to task for. 

I don't think this film needed a narrator. The Big Short had one, so they did it again. I guess it probably would have been pretty jarring to have the smash cuts to the Alfred Molina legal argument restaurant or to the Shakespearean bedtime scene. But more often than not it just served as a Michael Moore-type hand-holding through the writer's own conclusions, as narration often is. 

They got some stuff wrong. Everything this film said about the Unitary Executive Theory was completely inaccurate. I doubt they ran this past a constitutional law expert. 

I actually think the end monologue to the camera is probably the most accurate representation of Dick Cheney. It shows his faults and his character in a more honest way than the rest of the movie did. If you asked Dick Cheney why he did what he did, he would give you that speech. And he'd mean it.

Sam Rockwell as Dubya was great, but I couldn't tell if they were trying to intentionally trying to make him like a SNL parody or how Cheney actually saw him. 

Would've like to have seen more time devoted to 9/11 and the Iraq war. Mainly because I was 6,8 years old at the time, and remember seeing it on the news so much. 

As for the editing style. Some parts were well cut, some weren't. The fake credits just went on a little too long. The zoomed in faces, stock footage, and freeze frames I was used to from TBS. The narrator kind of confused me, as I didn't know who he was at all until I looked it up later. Some scenes that narration just could've been better without. 

I will say this though. This film and TBS really made me interested in the source material. After I watched TBS, I went and read the book as well. I even went and watched *Margin Call* because I heard it was on a similar subject . Shame that does not seem to be the case this time.

Parts were a little too on-the-nose about telling exactly what you should think. I think more of a straight-up biopic structure would've worked better than the style of ""The Big Short.""

It also doesn’t really work as a psychological portrait, since we don’t really get Cheney’s driving motivations (for running for Congress, for becoming SecDef and then VP), except that he was power-hungry. Yes, we know that, but I thought there'd be more. We only got some explanation of motivation with Bale’s sort-of monologue near the end, and that really only explains his post-9/11 motivations.

ecwlyv1,"Posting my thoughts on this from another thread - what a disappointment. This really feels like a movie that died in the editing room.

How does the team behind The Big Short’s clever conceits for explaining financial misdeeds fumble so hard with framing Cheney’s actions during the Bush presidency - which is a far simpler, digestible storyline?

So many touches from The Big Short that are carried over here — the side character narration, the use of news footage and pop culture, the text pop ups, editing & transition shenanigans, the macro takeaways — feel wholly out of place and poorly implemented.

Initially I wrote off most of the backlash and criticisms to political disagreements, but those have little to do with it in light of the clear fundamental problems. The movie jumps all over the place in tone, and it really struggles to just coherently explain a number of topics and events.

I agree with the vast majority of its takeaways but the delivery and execution is really lacking. It feels like a passionate essay by a student hopped up on Red Bull starting his assignment the night before it’s due. Or filmmakers high on their last success with full creative control when they needed to heed that their shit still stinks. This movie is unfortunately like every bad Spike Lee or Oliver Stone take on history.",a9gjba
ed6xbcs,"This film was wild to watch, as someone who was 15 when 9/11 happened, lost family in the attacks, and then attended college in NY during Bush's 2nd administration. I had a really leftist teacher in college who showed us a film on Halliburton and the insanity that was the Iraq invasion. 

I had a pretty strong and unexpected reaction to the 9/11 bits (my hands started sweating) and remember watching the exact footage of bombing Bagdad. 

I'm glad I saw it because those events are so strongly ingrained in my adolescence and young adulthood, and I was aware of so many of those pieces but had never really put them together. 

What a crazy ride.

eoz4god,Watched it yesterday on my flight. I enjoyed it. I was 12 when GWB was inaugurated and his administration did more to shape my political beliefs than anything else. I guess now depending on how accurate this film is Cheney is to blame for that. It was incredibly entertaining.,a9gjba
ecln7pm,"I was not a fan of Vice. At all.

I find Adam McKay's  style to extremely gimmicky, shallow and flashy. He uses various narrative and storytelling devices throughout the film that distract from the true meat of the story. He is more interested in condescending to the audience and showing off how clever he is than tackling that could have been an extremely interesting, in-depth exploration of one of the most powerful men in American history.

That said, the performances across the board are terrific. Christian Bale became Dick Cheney. The physical and vocal transformation was uncanny, but even more impressive was the depth he gave someone who could easily be written off as a monster. I did not like Cheney before the film, and watching it just solidified my opinion, but I was impressed by the humanity Bale gave Cheney. Amy Adams was also fantastic. I loved the steely, power-hungry quality she brought to Lynne. One of my favorite moments in the film was her reaction to [Mary coming out to her parents. The juxtaposition between Dick's empathy and Lynne's cold declaration that this will make things difficult sent shivers up my back.](#spoiler) I was so impressed with those two. Carell and Rockwell were great as well, even though I feel like Rockwell was so on that he should have been given more to do.

Overall a huge mixed bag. After this and The Big Short, I think I can definitively say that I am not a fan of McKay's brand of filmmaking.",a9gjba
eifxetp,Movie was waay waay over the top. Can safely say it was a Propaganda. Now I can't wait for Hollywood to make movies on Obama. How he completely ruined the economy. How he became a puppet of Wall Street and Bailed them out. Dropped more than 25000 bombs and got Nobel Peace Prize. How media kept on projecting him goody goody. lol. This could be hell of a movie. Only if someone in Hollywood decides to make it.,a9gjba
edq9834,"Felt like a michael Moore film aimed towards apolitical non-voters, specifically millennials.

It makes sense on some levels since you can only influence the future and the best way to do that is to show others why it is important to not only pay attention to the government but also to vote. The most impact you can have is on the younger demographic, so making a bush administration/Cheney wiki-style movie to both inform & entertain has some merits.

If you are not in those demographics, however, this movie may land inert, as there is no analysis of what you are seeing. And even if you had forgotten some of the details from that era, the movie doesn’t provide any added context to explain the significance of the abuses of power.

However, it did have some things going for it. Bale was absolutely amazing, as were Adams & Rockwell. I do like McKay’s styles for biopics, as the format is often very staid. Like many others have said in this thread, his style would be better served by a narrower focus, such as just Cheney’s time as Vice-President. Otherwise, you end up just scratching the surface of the significance of the events and people you are showing the audience.

Bale was terrific in this, but that's pretty much all I can say about this film.  

The opening quote, mid-credits scene and the restaurant scenes were really funny, but I couldn't figure out if this film was a comedy or drama? ",a9gjba
eeavc8v,Loved this movie. Mainly because I am fascinated with politics and in particular the most cut throat individuals in American political history. Cheney's life story is extremely interesting and Bale was terrific. I understand the criticisms as well but I liked the subject matter too much to be concerned. Also the editing was great. Love McKay's style where its hard to tell if the scene is a dramatization or a parody (restaurant scene). seeing this in theaters a second time so I can laugh out loud some more. ,a9gjba

I hate Dick Cheney, but I hate being talked down to more, and it's been a long while since I felt a filmmaker treat their audience with such contempt. McKay will make sure you know that you're stupid for wanting to be entertained and ignoring the world around you, because you can't do both.

It makes him a gigantic hypocrite. You're going to criticize the American public for being entertained, when you're making a dramatized movie about real events? Why not make a documentary, if this issue is so important you? Also, what exactly was Adam McKay doing during the Bush administration? Oh yeah, making Will Ferrell comedies. He can go fuck himself.

The performances were great, but there's a clear lack of story and vision. Nicholas Brittell's score was amazing too, but it was served by one of the most insulting films I've seen in quite some time.",a9gjba

And the ending montage did feel a bit propaganda to me. ",a9gjba
eckku1m,"Overall a very solid film. I think *The Big Short* was better, but *Vice* is no slouch. The best part is by far Bale's performance, supported by equally great showings from Rockwell and Adams. 

Probably the biggest gripe I've seen in here is that some are not a fan of the editing style and that it felt a bit disjointed, which I agree with to some extent. It isn't told 100% chronologically and at times it felt very rushed, certainly a bi product of trying to trek a vastly complicated story in just over 2 hours. McKay throws so much at the audience so fast, it's easy to miss things, which made me wonder if that was the point of the editing choices. Dick was a hugely powerful and overwhelming figure in DC, and the pace and some what confusing editing brought me back to what it was like trying to make sense of the world during the Bush administration.

8/10 for me",a9gjba
ekzthy5,"So not a conservative, nor an American, but I found the lack of self-awareness pretty amazing at times. I mean, at multiple points throughout the movie they state something to the affect of 'we're not mind readers, we don't know what *actually* happened' but then go on to spin their story anyway, and then at the very end when they go back to the focus group and the token conservative goes 'wait a minute, this film has a liberal bias' and the token liberal retorts ""these are all facts, reality has a liberal bias, etc.' all I could think is what? You can't have your cake and eat it too.",a9gjba

edmn51j,"I think Adam McKay doesn't like this Dick Cheney guy very much... just a hunch.

In fairness, I don't like Dick Cheney very much either, or at all for that matter. But that doesn't stop me from talking about how flawed this movie is.

It masquerades itself as being fact, and for the most part it is, but Mckay's own bias, opinion, and anger towards Dick cloud the film. He kind of slaps you in the face with his viewpoint, and in the end it makes the film come off as preachy. The filmmaking choices in this just come across as more pretentious than symbolic. What was with that voiceover? Truly awful, and the whole premise behind it was terrible.

The film jumps from his opinion of Dick being a dumb idiot who lucked his way into the white house and has no original political thoughts of his own. To him being a mad power hungry genius, bent on world power and manipulation... but also a loving father? Which one is it Adam?? The whole character of Cheney that McKay portrays is a bit of a walking contradiction and you don't know whether to pity him, like him, or despise him.

Bale is Cheney embodied in this, but I could see he was channeling a little Patrick Bateman in there. I also worry for his health when he takes on roles like this. Just wear a fat suit Christian.

The real star of this movie I think is Amy Adams, she was fantastic and completely disappeared in her portrayal of Lynne Cheney.

It's a disappointing film that preaches more than it satirizes. The jokes fall flat, the message falls flat, and it sees itself as more poetic, self important and moral than it really is.",a9gjba

ecpztmm,"Its not bad, but its nowhere near as good as The Big Short. It mines the same editing style and comedic sensibility to a reasonable degree of success, there are some truly hilarious moments.  

Overall though, the movies suffers from a crippling lack of intent. The Big Short was very clearly meant to educate and illustrate what happened and why the actions of those involved were so bad. Meanwhile, Vice cant seem to decide if it wants to be an indictment of neoconservative nihilism, or rationalize their actions as  misunderstood or misguided patriotism.   There are frequent jarring swings of tone from one scene to the next, without any narrative cohesion. 

Bales performance, while uncannily accurate, does nothing to alleviate the problem. Is his Dick Cheney a tortured family man, a megalomaniacal monster, an apathetic sociopath? All of them, none of them? He doesn't seem to know.

In the end, Vice is a film thats thick with emotional manipulation, and wafer-thin with actual insight.",a9gjba
ecmlngs,"I would encourage anyone who watched this to read Woodward's Bush at war series. The movie leaves out some incredibly important issues & conversations.  I would also encourage you to research some of the figures given at the end, they aren't wholly accurate and some come from not so reputable sources. 




I thought Bale was amazing as Cheney, and I like Mackay's style, but he just tried a bit hard to turn this into a hit piece.",a9gjba
ecpnt3a,"I saw it a few hours ago. I thought it was...OK I guess. A dissapointment for sure considering how much I loved The Big Short.

Bale of course was great as was Amy Adams. Carell played Rumsfeld to the point of being a cartoon character that it just took me out of the movie. I kind of had the same issue with Rockwell as Bush, but all of his scenes were so funny I kind of let it slide.

The movie is a goddamn mess. It felt like since The Big Short was so acclaimed that the studio gave McKay complete creative control here and just went overboard. The pacing and plot were so damn sloppy and nothing about it felt structured. It just felt like it kept jumping from scene-to-scene in Cheney's life and as one review put it feels like a collection of Greatest Hits more than an actual story. The editing style didn't work nearly as well here as it did in The Big Short and a lot of the metaphors came off as forced instead of clever. I also really didn't care for Jesse Pleamons narration.

As someone who despises Cheney, even I felt that the film was a bit too bias. Make no doubt that Cheney is a despicable man, but having a director that could have restrained their hatred for him I think would have benefited the film overall. Despite started the film with ""How does a person end up like this"", we never really got any insight in to what drove Cheney. Lots of information was glossed over and it really didn't try to present both sides to some information and instead felt like it was saying ""Hey, the Republicans and Cheney supported this, so that automatically makes it bad! Also here is another bad thing they supported!"". The smugness of it just got tiresome after a while.

Overall, I think this should have been a miniseries instead of a film as I just don't think all of this information can be effectively told in a 2 hour film. I also think that either a different director should have handled it or someone should have kept McKay from going overboard as he did here. I would still give it a 6/10 for the performances and the moments that do work, but this was one of the biggest dissapointments of the year for me.",a9gjba

ecjh9k0,"Really solid performances from Bale, Adams, and Rockwell. They put in the work beyond the makeup and the clear tongue-in-cheek nature of the script and played real characters.

Unfortunately, the film strives in opposite directions, and fails on both ends. It does not respect the facts enough (possibly due to a dearth of personal information from famously secretive people) to be a compelling biopic, and it does not commit to the humor enough to be a proper comedy. It is self-aware in the worst possible way, with every wink to the camera making the audience groan instead of giggle. That post-credits scene: yikes.",a9gjba
ecs6noi,"That felt like a hot mess, and I went in really wanting to like it (I was a huge fan of The Big Short and hate Dick Cheney).

There are two major problems coming to my mind right now, fresh out of the theater:

1. The frenetic editing style doesn't make sense for this film. It made sense for The Big Short because of the sharp, fast wheeling-and-dealing of the characters and their numbers game. The nature of Dick Cheney was explained in the quotation at the beginning of the film: the silent man watches and waits, then strikes and makes his move. He's the patient fisherman. They use that metaphor in the film repeatedly. But the editing style is just the opposite. Bale's physicality as Cheney is slow, lumbering, still, silent, lying in wait. His character in The Big Short couldn't have been any more different, with the feverish drumming and yelling and sweating. The fast-paced editing style worked there. I would have preferred a quieter editing style for this one to match thematically (i.e., more long lingering shots that keep us on edge until the kill.)
2. The concept of the heart donor narrator was ineffective for me. It was odd that someone essentially being a placeholder for ""The American Everyman"" would overexplain for the audience and essentially treat them like they're morons. That worked in The Big Short because the unreliable narrator is supposed to be a contemptuous asshole in general, and the subject matter was honestly probably less intuitive than the unitary executive theory. Also, in The Big Short, it made sense when the asides/""fourth wall breaks"" were coming from the main players, because the narrator himself is a main player in the narrative. In this, the fourth wall breaks came from Cheney at the end, his wife in the soliloquy, and the heart donor throughout. Why, if this is from the viewpoint of the heart donor as a narrator? It felt inconsistent and unintentional. If there was a clear pattern/intention to it, I would be interested in hearing people's thoughts (because I didn't get it)

That said, the costumes, makeup, set design, and performances of this film were just fantastic. It sort of left me wishing for this film to be re-edited more like a straight-out biopic, but still with the nasty edge to it. Or just... more minimal commentary. I'm fine with cutting the shots of snagging the fish with Bush eating chicken wings and getting suckered. More of that ""showing not telling"" would have been preferable to the belabored narration. Or like, the mouthwash scene. Just let the audience sit with it while he mulls over the decision. We don't need the heart donor to jump in and say ""No one knows what Cheney was thinking!""

EDIT: forgot to give a shoutout to the music as well. Now I'm regretful that we won't get to see this musical number that was once in the film...",a9gjba

ecrt725,"When you overhype a simple movie like The Big Short, it's impossible for anybody to be pleased with your next film, I guess. Let me explain, The Big Short got praise from the general audience because its a more recent subject that most are familiar with personally, and the film had to up the entertainment factor due to the subject matter being more boring than any economics class ever taught. Also, having a charming guy like Ryan Gosling narrate and star helps a bunch too. Its purpose was to tell the stories of the few people in the world who saw the writing on the wall and how it didn't matter. 
Vice's purpose was to show how vile, cruel, and power hungry Dick Cheney was. I'm gonna stop here because I just contradicted myself when I first read the comments here. The Big Short has nothing to do with this film and I don't think its relevant to how you feel about this movie as a whole. 

Also, who knew Lynne Cheney was such a monster?",a9gjba
ecsg7a3,"It's an interesting film. On the one hand you have outstanding performances by basically everyone in the film. I think I was surprised by Amy Adams the most. I just didn't expect her to have the acting chops she does. On the other hand, by suggesting that every bad thing that has occurred in the world is due to Dick Cheney and that his motives are purely evil completely diminishes the reality of his actual shitty character. It's not necessary to overly dramatize Cheney's actions to reveal him as an asshole. You just have to tell it straight. I also felt the film did it self a disservice by opening with the quote that basically just said ""some of this stuff happened and we did our fucking best."" It really just undermines much of what follows - because why am I supposed to care if what I'm seeing maybe happened the way it's portrayed or maybe it didn't but if it didn't who cares it's fun  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .

ed7iwou,"Really disappointed by this one.  Figured maybe it would be a funny satire, there are jokes but it doesn’t have the comedic timing of Big Short.

The most interesting part is when Bush came in to power and instead its a quick montage of term 1 and then Obama comes in.  There was no narrative or story.  So much happened in the Bush era and had they spread through Cheney’s origins, we could have gotten an interesting movie about what really went on.  Not to mention a lot of people supported the war, this whole woke thing happened term 2 with some having sense after late term 1.  Not to mention the damage that entire administration did.  It was too focused on Cheney and that was its downfall whereas Big Short focused on different sides & people of the same story.

And the film doesn’t mention anything new. Maybe for future generations but a lot of us lived this and saw it on the news. Rumsfeld resigning on tv was more exciting than the movie because it came out of nowhere and showed things were getting bad.

Ultimately, I felt like the screenplay could’ve matured a little longer. The story could have been tighter.

I wish there were more cutaways like in the big short to explain topics in the film.

I wish the movie was more comedic than it was. I think the performances were strong, especially Bale’s. 

Ultimately, I wish McKay spent more time working on the screenplay because I believe it would have made the film a whole lot better. ",a9gjba
edmc483,"Anyone else get a sort of Tarantino vibe from this movie? The meta/wall-breaking/narration style of the movie is very reminiscent of some of Tarantino's movies. When Tarantino comes out with new movies you sort of know how the flow of the movie is going to go, and his style really comes across and is easily recognizable in all of his work.

I certainly don't mind it when directors decide to take a different approach to format and traditional biopic tone, but sometimes it was hard to follow. The scenes they chose to hop back and forth in time with didn't feel significant to each other...it was hard to get what the tone was as well. 

I didn't get the point McKay was trying to make with this film. He obviously has a bone to pick with Cheney but the film kinda struggles to have like...a central grievance..not that it needed to have one but at different points in the final third you felt like the movie was trying to harp on one and be like ""this is his greatest sin""  wether it be the rise in right wing hysteria, Iraq, executive power, the military industrial complex, his daughter Mary...or even the fact that he got a heart transplant..Mckay seemed to really drive that one home. 

I feel like they totally just said fuck it in regards to 2005-2008. Like the movie jumps straight from Rumsfeld leaving to Obama's inauguration speech. Mentions nothing about Scooter Libby's legal issues. 

Tyler fucking Perry is in this movie. 

Carrell was fun. The heart attack 'gag' was a big hit in the theater. Felt like the movie could of been a more effective hatchet job on Cheney (which McKay was definitely going for) but failed in some respects. Jesse Clemons as the narrator was...a choice...

ed19oz3,"Really didn't like this movie. It felt too personal, the nakers hatred if Cheney was tio palpable. And before anyone says ""FACTS!"" like the ending scene, I don't think there are *nearly* enough facts in the movie. The story basically cpuld tell itself, instead it's a mess of The Big Short attempts and personal attacks.

Prime example: the restaurant scene where they just *tell* the audience that the administration approved of torture and uses Gitmo to deny rights. Thay's a massive part of Cheneys legacy, and it gets maybe 30 seconds of screen time total, but we really needed 10 minutes of him getting a DUI. I'd much rather see the torture memos fleshed out, hear the actual arguments used, know when it happened (dates become albut nonexistent once hes actually VP), see how it was dissemenated and implemented, having the public find out, and dealing with the fallout. None of that happened, but we really needed to hear the narrator xall him a ""scumbag"" for dropping out college and drinking.

Once Cheney actually takes power as the VP, the movie goes over what should be the meat and potatoes of the story in essentially a long, shallow montage.

From starting as a improv guy at second city in Chicago to becoming the head writer at SNL where he dabbled in short digital films to directing/writing comedy cornerstone features like Anchorman and Talladega Nights and to now.  His work has always been political with each entry getting more and more so.  I found the ambiguous storytelling to be refreshing and scary.

I’ve seen some complaints that the movie humanizes Cheney, but I don’t think that’s the case at all. I came out of the film despising Cheney, though the film could have gone into more detail about what really drove him (power? Lynne?) I do think the film went a little soft on Powell and Bush, who were equally as guilty as Cheney for everything that happened. 

I haven’t seen the Big Short, so I was a little apprehensive about McKay’s style, but I ended up loving it. It was unique and it worked well. The one scene that really stuck out was the Cheney/Bush bait scene. The humor hit for me, though I could see how it’s not for everyone.

The editing was all over the place and at times it was honestly annoying.. It felt like things that didn't need to be interrupted were interrupted and things that didn't need to be focal points stuck for way too long. The characters outside of Dick were horribly lazy flanderizations for the sake of furthering this random, contrived hate boner for Dick Cheney. 

The Big Short worked because it was focused on one topic, and educated people on things that were inherently complex. It was an awesome movie and I loved it.

This film was half truths with some real stuff sprinkled in and it made it so horribly confusing as to what was real and what wasn't. This is my biggest problem with the film because this is where it becomes patronizing. It's as if the director is saying that the actual truth as he sees it is as absurd as the portrayal he's created here and that we don't need to know the actual truth because it's all nonsense anyway. 

There was no really interesting or compelling story to tell here, I'm not sure why McKay felt the need to tell it. Fuck this movie.

Some people took that too seriously as well. I really loved this film. One thing that stood out to me is the reference to people wanting only to be entertained in tragic times.

ecy8v13,"So, I'm coming late to this, and I might be coming from a different point of view from most here (which I admit, probably isn't a good thing, as I may have some garbage opinions).

So I actually don't dislike Dick Cheney irl all that much. I think he generally was a good VP in regards to what he did.  Certainly not with everything, but ultimately I'd have rather had him there than not have had him there.

So I went into the movie excited. I knew it'd be a hit piece but I was really looking forward to Bale's performance.

The performances for all of them lived up to the hype. I genuinely was excited by basically every single major and minor performance (seriously, they were all on fire), which really helped, considering what most of you have said- the film is all over the place.

However, when I left the theater, I left happy- but I felt that, if I was a liberal, I wouldn't have? I'm not totally sure, but to me McKay went too far when humanizing Cheney. The parts with his daughter and more importantly, Cheney's final soliloquy, felt like Cheney himself wrote them, and went incredibly far in humanizing him and explaining his arguments.

At the same time, he goes a bit too far in stating some things as fact that simply weren't so. His entire explainer of the Unitary Executive Theory- something pretty important for the film- was laughably bad, and some other moments were a bit too…well, not subtle at all. If Cheney is the evil guy McKay thinks he is (and he very well could be, to each their own), McKay shouldn't need to stoop to outright making stuff up at points.

ecl61gf,"Great movie. I get the sense that the people who didn’t like this movie are likely right wing apologists who are uncomfortable with the ideas expressed by the movie.

Yes, the tone of the movie jumped between comical and serious, but what else can you do with a story like this? It wouldn’t have been appropriate to be either one or the other. To some degree, all you can do is laugh at how absurd our leaders really are. And to another, you can’t laugh at the carnage they have wrought either. Let’s not forget that this is a biography and is simply a retelling of facts, so it’s not entirely up to the director to formulate the story in a way that fits a certain tone. It feels both outrageous and unconscionable to me and the movie would have felt incomplete if it weren’t both as well.

I will say that I think what this film failed to achieve is to really explain why Cheney did all of these things. Was he corrupt? Greedy? Did he just not care about lives lost in war, etc.? The damage he did is, I would say, unquestionable, and the movie definitely shows it. But the question of why still lingers.

But overall, definitely a thumbs up. It was an 8/10 for me. The acting was really top-notch, and Steve Carell in particular just continues to amaze me. Christian Bale did a great Cheney, though honestly I wish Oscars would go to people who create characters out of thin air and not to the ones who just do a really good impression of someone.",a9gjba

I kinda wish the movie had been 20-30 minutes longer—that way, they could have gone into depth on the 2000 recount and the Valerie Plame leak. If you don’t remember the Bush years, they might have fallen flat, but they hit me hard because I remember so much about that time.

Kudos to McKay for including the parts about the Unitary Executive and the legal philosophies that led to Cheney’s power—that’s the kind of stuff that can be dry and boring, but is essential to understanding our government.

Personally I think the film could have been so great and I really don't get why McKay had to insert completely unrelated things such as Fox News, the Heritage Foundation even Alex Jones (?) into this. Plus the heart donor's story was completely made up. 

Bale and Adams were great. But McKay should have done a documentary instead and have someone else do a biopic. ",a9gjba

This could’ve been a great opportunity for McKay and co to have said ‘’Yes, everyone is terrified of Trump but remember when he had competent, actually intelligent people in charge who also had terrible ideas?’’ That was barely skimmed (the unilateral executive theory, the telecon with John Yoo) but nothing more.

Christian bale looked like dick but who cares! This movie didn’t have anything to say. Nothing interesting to say anyway. I was a totally unawares toddler when Cheney was VP and this movie still taught me nothing. The movie could have ended after that dumb piece of text at the beginning that reads something like “Cheney was one of the most secretive leaders ever” because the movie had nothing else to say about him or his regime. Any INFORMATION shared in this movie could surely be found in the first couple paragraphs of Cheney’s Wikipedia. Also had it ended there we could’ve been saved from the pointless vulgarity: “but we tried our fucking best.” What an asshole. 

Adam McKay comes off like such a jaded old yuppie in this movie. He points the finger at millennials every chance he has like it was them who invaded iraq and not Cheney. What was the point of the button of the movie being a young woman claiming the next fast and furious movie will be lit? Plus not like it’s young woman in line to see those movies and it certainly isn’t young woman who elected bush or Cheney or trump.  What was the point of Cheney standing over that man with a broken leg? What was the point of Cheney no longer supporting gay marriage- or ever in the first place? None of this moved the movie in any direction. Maybe down. What was the point of any of it? I really can’t think of anything but maybe to win an Oscar cause Christian bale gained some weight. If that’s the point- pointless.

If you hate young people this is the movie for you. Adam McKay makes sure to make all of them stupid and or gay so if you are sick of youngsters you can watch this piece of crap and let your hate fester. Maybe spit on hybrid car after leaving the theatre. I think that’s what Adam McKay would want. ",a9gjba

Cheney had an inspirational story. Not sure how he was a dirtbag. He was a blue collar guy who went back to school, then he climbed the government ladder.

Sam Rockwell looked like he belonged in a different movie. His Dubya was too much of a cartoon. Brolin was better. Bush was a former drunk who also got his shit together. Became a Harvard and Yale graduate and governor of a major state.

Apple stock was trading at $1.50 before 9/11. It's now 100 TIMES more valuable. Halliburton stock just went up 500% in 17 years.

Everyone hated Saddam. After 9/11, having an insane Muslim dictator with possible WMDs was not a good idea. Plans to invade Iraq were underway in the 1990s. Including divvying up the oil fields. Most American oil comes from America, including in 2003.

600,000 Iraqi dead is a made-up figure since it includes deaths not related to combat.

ecpmqjc,"Liked but didn’t love it. I had very high hopes for this as both a movie and a corrective to the mass public amnesia about the Bush years, and it mostly delivered I guess. The scope was really broad, and even without stuff that was overemphasized like unitary executive theory, it was bound to miss stuff. Performances were all pretty good, the only one that really stood out to me as more of a caricature was Rockwell’s Bush (though I still enjoyed his presence). Overall the pacing and editing were competent, and I thought the narration was fine. The acerbic tone some reviewers described as insulting I found mostly fine if a bit hamfisted (mid-credit scene was lame). I think the movie was trying to capture the spirit of the system that allowed Dick Cheney to come to power, and in that sense we certainly did “choose” him, but I can understand how that aspect might be missed.

As for the historical record, imo they let a lot of people off easy. From a narrative standpoint it made sense to focus on Cheney the man, but I felt like they gave short shrift to the actual Vice years. People outside of Cheney’s circle can’t all be covered thoroughly but they’re basically treated as unimportant (Karl Rove, swept aside? Lol). Also, one day we’ll get a serious Bush biopic in this vein that doesn’t treat him like a caricature but as a primary driver of all this mess. My biggest complaint is how they make him out to be a loud rube rather than an active participant in shaping the War on Terror. In a way it gives in to the bumbling grandpa image he’s been cultivating since he left office, which is a shame given how much he pushed for invasion, torture, extrajudicial power, etc. Anyway, movie’s worth seeing.",a9gjba

We wait for her to get into focus, which takes at least 11 minutes, ""Who's that Dick?""...about a half hour of staring at each other followed by..""I'll do it.""

ecxf65a,"I believe in capitalism but we should invest in education for our youth. Out there there could be a genius who could cure a disease but can’t afford to go to college.  I hear people complain about ACÁ because it makes people pay for those who are sick - which is exactly what insurance is for.    There is plenty of profit to be made in other areas not pertaining to health and education.  Health costs should be lower and yes, I do believe in price controls in cases like this. Cut spending and encourage disease prevention.  If we can spend assisting other countries, we can help our own.  Cut lobbying from pharmaceutical companies vying for favoritism for their products and the FDA stamping down on their competitors.  
I have a problem with a criminal getting free education while law abiding citizens struggle with tuition. I understand the intent but if everyone got an education, then we’d all be playing on a level field. Speaking of which, no lowering of standards, strictly a meritocracy system and I know there will be those left behind but we can deal with these issues as they come. 
   For some reason, no one complains when our taxes pay for Congress’s health insurance but if the working man asks for a break, suddenly it’s socialism. Did you know congressmen not only have “business lunches” that we pay for but in the 70s the White House tried to keep them down to 3 alcoholic drinks and they had a shit fit. Can you imagine? If I had three drinks for lunch I’d be sleepy as hell getting back to the office.  
I don’t like unmerited welfare or any social programs where people abuse the system. I don’t like the wealthy using tax loopholes either because it abuses the system. In short,  when it comes to health, education and housing, profit motive shouldn’t be primary. Profit yes, but not unbridled

ect32qj,"> The movie was a bit sloppy with its narrative structure

The issues dealt with in this movie are so intersectional, so wrapped up in so many things, that they simply didn't have the time to properly analyze them. They tried to build Cheney up as a character by devoting a good portion of the front end of the film to his rise, but in my mind they should've just cut to the chase in the Bush admin and go hard as fuck on the war and the corporate-media-military complex.

I also don't think this movie went in enough on the right topics. No one seeing this movie are going to be Bush/Cheney apologists, they already hate them. I wish they attacked the very institutions that allowed these corporate sludge monsters to come to power in the first place and relayed that back to today (because what a surprise America is once again selling itself out to corporate interest so some catatonic 79 year old that owns a raisin company can go from being worth $5B to $10B).

The difference between Vice and The Big Short is that the later could hone in on the mortgage crisis and collateralized debt obligations, giving it way more focus. Vice tried to cover the rise of neoconservatism in America, the MSM, perverse corporatism in politics, morality in late capitalism, dogwhistling, ideations of power in the west, think tanks, tax reform, I mean the list goes in.

It was too scattershot for the average person to come away with a ""wow holy fuck we are so fucked"" mentality like The Big Short did, which ironically is exactly how most administrations want/wanted you to feel. American powers are just a tornado gangbang of fuckery that move too fast for anyone to realize that they're getting sold their own noose.",a9gjba

Worked very well for me. I was a young adult back then and not yet too into politics.

They didn't repeat the same thing about the unitary theory there were many interesting questions is brought up:  Limits of presidential power, how our government should work vs how it does work, how politics worked when Chaney was coming up vs during his presidency, how 9/11 changes everything, how focus grouping politics is so different than doing the right thing (think how Colin Powel conducted himself)

&#x200B;

It's really interesting that he ended up looking like that for you, to me it looked like he came in bright eyed and busy tailed, ready and eager to fulfill all there was to the role of being a humble servant to the nation. After several decades of learning the system he had become a master of the trade, and that what he learned from all those decades had ultimately made him cross lines he never would've crossed. He started doing ""behind the door"" deals after Donald Rumsfeld told him what Nixon and Kissinger were doing behind the closed doors, and he constantly felt betrayed by other politicians who he felt ""didn't get it"" and so he started getting pissed off when people were trying to ruin what he was trying to build, which he perceived as what everyone is trying to do, which may have given you the possible perception of being a selfish asshole.

&#x200B;

So I didn't see him as a selfish asshole but instead a person that was a product of his environment. Politics had become his new addiction, and much like what happened to him when he was an alcoholic, he became completely consumed by it. 

&#x200B;

I think we saw politics in its purest form, and it's nowhere close to what we are expecting it to be, so it makes you feel like he was out of the box, but I feel like he was portrayed to exemplify what the polls showed the American people were looking for their politicians to do. A more cynical way of looking at the movie I suppose but I feel like it's better considering this perspective than scapegoating Dick Cheney as an edge case.

It waffles back and forth between condemning neoconservatism as a whole, painting Cheny as its villainous power hungry man-behind-the-curtain; and rationalizing his actions as almost justifiable in a manner that's inevitably going to alienate anyone looking to take political validation from the film regardless of which side of the spectrum they fall on.


As a film it suffers from a severe lack of narrative cohesion and tonal consistency. Bale's imitation is remarkable but the performance lacks depth. Adams, however, is excellent.

Bush is actually a pretty smart fellow. Lots of people who worked with him say so. It was his scheme to seem more like an average Joe while being way smarter than that.

She was the one who was power hungry, at first, and her constant encouragement to keep taking and taking as much as he could (as well as his association with other morally bankrupt individuals like Rumsfeld) was what set him on the path he'd eventually go on when 9/11 hit. Then you get the perfect storm of ""No hesitation to do right by my people"" and ""I have no moral qualms over anything"" that led to him abusing power.

Edit: I remember they also mention that Cheney wasn't particularly exceptional or driven in his younger years but had a ""servant"" mentality that led him to excel so long as it was, technically, under the instruction and in service to another authority.

The biggest problem I have from the movie is the realization that politics are likely beyond repair.  Giant money interests will forever decide the direction of everything and nobody is safe from it.

Politics are 100% corrupt.  Even the best intended, purest of integrity politician is not safe from the the far reaching pocketbooks of the giant money makers. 

We are so socially, economically and politically divided within the United States that we cannot differentiate the light from the darkness.

I mean, the two biggest complaints I've seen with Vice so far are ""It makes Cheney look too good"" and ""It's too liberally biased!"" which seems weird to me, those are conflicting critiques, how could the movie both make Cheney look too good *and* make him look too evil? 

Cheney *was* a human, so humanizing him makes sense. I think most people went in to the theatre expecting to see a movie about one of the most monstrous politicians we've had in a long time, and so I think spending time on making him out to be a real person with real motivations and feelings and emotions was important. Because that's the thing about many monsters; they're real people like us, with emotions and motivations and rationalizations for their monstrous actions. 

As for the explanations, that was an issue with The Big Short too IIRC, but at a certain point when you're trying to dumb down complex issues you're going to lose accuracy. I mean, I don't think either The Big Short nor Vice tries very hard to hide the fact that the movie thinks it's *way* smarter than the people watching. So while it is kind of annoyingly smug, I do think that they break those issues down in a way that are understandable from a narrative standpoint to make it easier to follow the movie. ",a9gjba

I feel like they didn't over villainize him, nor did they treat him like an angel. But I don't know much about Unitary Executive Theory, so how did they mess that up? 

Overall I feel like people are so biased these days, that if you are a die-hard conservative, this movie was unfair in how it treated Dick. But, if you're a liberal, you are doing a disservice to all of the people who's lives were ruined by his work in humanizing him.

Good job writing off all valid criticism (political or otherwise) as nothing but the unintelligent view of republican dolts. Did you stand up and clap for the mid credit scene?

>Yes, the tone of the movie jumped between comical and serious, but what else can you do with a story like this?

Let the performances carry the film instead of McKays kinetic editing style, which simply isn’t as effective when the majority of the leading cast is supposed to be older balding politicians and the footage you cut to is fly fishing. 

>I will say that I think what this film failed to achieve is to really explain why Cheney did all of these things. Was he corrupt? Greedy? Did he just not care about lives lost in war, etc.?

Personally it’s 6.5 or 7 for me. Needed more polish",a9gjba
eclkcjg,"The way I interpreted it, at least as the movie presented it, is that Cheney's primary motivation to start was his family. He was listless and his wife gave him purpose by encouraging him to pursue political power that she personally wanted but could never get for herself. She was the one who was power hungry, at first, and her constant encouragement to keep taking and taking as much as he could (as well as his association with other morally bankrupt individuals like Rumsfeld) was what set him on the path he'd eventually go on when 9/11 hit. Then you get the perfect storm of ""No hesitation to do right by my people"" and ""I have no moral qualms over anything"" that led to him abusing power.

I remember they also mention that Cheney wasn't particularly exceptional or driven in his younger years but had a ""servant"" mentality that led him to excel so long as it was, technically, under the instruction and in service to another authority. You can see how easy it would be to go from ""My Wife wants this"" ""My boss wants this"" ""My constituents want this"" ""The President wants this"" ""The American people want this"" without ever really taking personal responsibility for the decisions you are making.",a9gjba

You occasionally see a glimpse of what Bale’s performance could have been in the beginning of the movie where Cheney actually has strong motivations, but once he hits the big time in politics the film loses interest in trying to contextualize Cheney and just wants to end up explaining what he did (and doing a poor job at that).

eg7s983,"> “After looking online, it looks like the only controversial aspects are the tone of the movie and portrayal of Cheney’s mother in law’s death. Besides that it seems to check out.”

The film’s strong implication that Cheney’s father-in-law murdered his wife wasn’t “controversial” - it was apparently a flat-out unsubstantiated defamation lie.

There are reportedly many other (more important) historical and legal aspects in the film that were either twisted or completely fabricated for no justified reason. Like the 9/11 decision room scene which, according to Condoleezza Rice, happened very differently: with the POTUS (Bush) being on the telephone line and giving Cheney confirmation orders. The fact that the film twists that around (as if Cheney went rogue and refused to get confirmation orders from the President) is a sign of lazy screenwriting.

This film does not “check out” - it’s half-truths (at best) with a lot of fabrication to try to fit everything that happened (and didn’t happen) into the filmmakers’ preconceived image of Cheney as a master puppeteer and de facto king. When in reality, many of his colleagues reported that he had no more advisory power over the POTUS than the other key decision-makers in Bush’s cabinet, including Rice and Card.

The main thing that checks out is the Halliburton oil connection motive for the war, but that has been universally known for over a decade now and is no revelation in light of the overall trend of continuous US foreign policy incursions into the oil-rich ME.

You must have also missed the part where they mentioned that the Kochs started funneling money into conservative think tanks.

Zarqawi created his terrorist organization in 1999, and was killed in 2006 when the group was called al Qaeda in Iraq because it had pledged loyalty to al Qaeda. There was a pretty significant schism between the two groups. They disassociated due to AQI's focus on sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia, rather than focusing on their mutual enemy of the United States, Israel, and the West in general.

The invasion unquestionably led to the instability that later gave birth to ISIS, but the narrative just isn't accurate. Powell's speech was about WMD, and was seen through that lens for the last 15 years. The only reason to shift focus to ISIS is to put a counter-narrative to Trump's statements that Obama is the founder of ISIS.

You've got Rumsfeld cowering in an office being used as a stock room asking Cheney if they'll be prosecuted. Then Obama being sworn in. Then a montage of MAGA discord. Come on, man. This is really significant, but it's just quickly bounced through.

It was perhaps the most real, human narrative in the entire film, but it was used solely for lazy dramatic beats, especially at the end. The movie had no actual interest in Mary Cheney or her father's thoughts on the LGBT community. 

I would have preferred they spend more time parsing Cheney's opinions on gay marriage and his daughter's life, or leave it out entirely.

Instead, we get the Alfred Molina ""waiter"" scene (which is utterly tone deaf), and a map of oil fields.

Carell said he listened to a tape (and it's actually publicly available as well, and in the documentary I mention below) where Nixon, Kissinger and Haldeman (Nixon's Chief of Staff) were talking about Rumsfeld and saying that they need to watch themselves around him, because he is someone who is not to be trusted at face-value.

""As the world becomes more and more confusing, we tend to focus on the things that are right there in front of us. While ignoring the massive forces that actually change and shape our lives. And with people working longer and longer hours, for less and less wages, when we do have free time, the last thing we want is complicated analysis of our government, lobbying, international trade agreements.""

The strong implication that Cheney’s father-in-law murdered his mother-in-law seems to have been completely fabricated on the basis of no evidence or family statements whatsoever.

The implication that Cheney had no idea whether he was a Dem or a Republican before entering politics also appears to be untrue. He was reportedly a staunch conservative from his college days.

Such outlandish fictional liberties (or rather rewrites of his family history) served no justified purpose in the story and were completely gratuitous / unnecessary 

The authorisation to shoot down any non-compliant planes on 9/11 (which was a big focal point in the film) was in fact apparently discussed and authorised by the POTUS (Bush) during a phone call that morning, per Condoleezza Rice’s own statement. So reportedly Cheney did not make that decision as a de facto king, but followed Presidential authorisation.

The film twists and grossly over-simplifies the historical narrative to present Cheney as a cardboard figure who went from blank-slate non-partisan ingénue (no, he was Republican from the get go) to omnipotent, solo-ruling Machiavelli (no, he still followed RoE protocol and sought confirmation orders from Bush as POTUS).

The effect of this strange (lazy in my view) artistic decision is that it makes Cheney more unclear as a character (his conservative ‘radicalisation’ in college is overlooked entirely, though it could have helped explain and contextualise many of his political actions). And it strangely absolves Bush of any responsibility at key moments, in favour of portraying him as an over-simplified puppet.

eg7l1eo,"I’m late to this discussion, but having just seen this film wanted to add a correction:

No, the filmmakers of “Vice” did use creative licence extensively. I wish they had made that more clear in an opening disclaimer.

E.g. in terms of “events”, Cheney’s portrayed ‘order’ to expose / leak the secret identity of a CIA operative (and thereby endanger her life and the life of her family), as a form of ‘revenge / gagging tactic’ against her journalist husband, appears to be pure speculation.

Such unsupported liberties were used to convince the viewer of Cheney’s cold-blooded assassin nature. However, it seems irresponsible, lazy storytelling, and that point could have been better illustrated by a deeper exploration of his ties with Halliburton prior to the Iraq invasion.

eg7n3qy,"Just to add 2 cents to an old discussion: “Vice” is quite far from being “all factual”. It over-simplifies and even twists many aspects in order to (quite lazily) shoehorn them into an idealised moral message.

My issue with the film is that it adopts the style of a quasi-documentary (narration, using real footage) which misleads many viewers into believing many of the head-scratching liberties it took with parts of the historical, bureaucratic and family narrative.

The irony is that there’s enough circumstantial evidence pointing to Cheney’s amoral, greedy character for a gripping enough film, without having to resort to highly questionable, unhelpful distortions that the filmmakers utilised.

ecy6247,"Nail on the head. I really want to give the movie the benefit of the doubt; that time will prove it to be a better movie than initial reactions so far, but so much of it feels half-baked and lazy -- particularly the comedy.

McKay still doesn't get enough credit for how weird and subversive Step Brothers, Anchorman, Talladega Nights were at the time of their releases for popular comedies, and if his framing of the financial crisis in TBS was a bit too simplistic (the brief mentions of Alan Greenspan and other high-profile figures to pass blame onto them, the sociopath/moron caricatures of certain bankers), it nevertheless worked to great effect as an engaging primer on the topic for any layman and made for an unexpectedly, uniquely funny approach to a synopsis that had been reserved to documentaries and somber dramas.

For Vice, many of the set-ups feel so stale. In particular, the fake credits and evil shakespearean dialogue bits -- I feel like I've already seen a variation on those jokes a dozen of times already that belong in a lesser comedy sketch. The inconsistent tone doesn't help either -- several people in my showing didn't know if they were supposed to laugh at Bale in fat man make-up running to the secure location during the ominous opening scenes, or when he gets pulled over for drunk driving. He falls down drunk but then a slow somber string begins to play and the scene fades out. In too many scenes, the movie isn't sure of what tone it's going for, which deflates a lot of the drama and comedy.

I thought the LGBT subplot was fine at first and one of the few moments to humanize Cheney that worked, but then later using it as the ultimate and final example of his bad deeds with the melodramatic score blazing to really sway the audience's perception of him -- after totally sidestepping his insistence and motivations on invading the Middle East? Or how he was supposedly controlling the Bush presidency? You instead play up the small-stakes family conflict for the climax? That's the topic you end on? C'mon.

This movie is a perfect example of why granting filmmakers carte blanche isn't necessarily a good thing. Annapurna Pictures need to hire level-headed people with a spine who actually challenge their creatives (and who also know how to effectively market their products -- there's a reason why many of their projects flop and they're in disarray right now).

ecsklnc,">You nailed it. The film didn’t show what truly drove him. (Chaney). We’re just lead to believe he just wants the power to cause chaos. Even Hitler had motivations that albeit morally wrong, made sense and helped us understand him. Vice didn’t address this at all. This is the films biggest downfall.

For anybody who’s genuinely interested in this, the documentary *The World According to Dick Cheney* (which came out in 2013) covered this pretty well (why Cheney did what he did, and what were his motivations).

It allowed Cheney to explain himself in his own words without being shouted over by somebody else, but also asked probing questions and didn’t let him get away with not answering the question. One example of this that you can actually see in the trailer for the documentary is when the interviewer just asks him a bunch of benign questions (“What trait do you value most in other people?”, “What’s your idea of a perfect day?”) and then asks him, “What is your greatest flaw?” and Cheney is visibly stumped by this question. But he’s compelled to give an answer so he just says, “Well I guess I could say that I don’t have any flaws.”

And that’s it, there’s times where the interviewer just lets him speak his mind and hang himself on his own words, without interrupting or trying to have a confrontational interview.

The documentary covers his life’s story starting all the way back in Wyoming and his DUI, him failing out of Yale, and then his entire career in Washington. For anybody who really wants a glimpse into Dick Cheney’s psyche, or is just curious to hear his own perspective of how things happened and why the decisions he made were the best he thought he could make at the time, it is definitely a film worth seeing.

I say all this as someone who loathes him as a human being but still found it interesting getting to hear his side of the story and what his thought process through all this was.",a9gjba

He *is* kind of like a guy who thinks that he's smarter than he really is, and acts that way.

There's a scene in that documentary where he tells the director that in his book *Rumsfeld's Rules* (or whatever of his books he's referencing), he says that he believes in the two aphorisms, ""Belief in the inevitability of conflict can become one of its main causes."" and ""If you wish for peace, prepare for war.""

He says this with a big smile on his face, like he's made some kind of grand philosophical observation.

And then the guy interviewing him (the director of the film) is kind of shocked and exasperatedly says, ""But then... you could use that to justify anything.""

And Rumsfeld doesn't really respond.

He gives the impression of liking to project this image of elder statesmanship and wisdom from experience in Washington, but he really comes across as a guy who thinks way too highly of himself and (like Cheney) never really examines his own personal flaws.

The pieces of ""wisdom"" he dispenses are like the predictions in Chinese fortune cookies. Hollow, vague, not much substance.

egahe20,"Interesting stuff and the source seems legit. Thanks for sharing. I will say I personally don’t have a problem with the director taking those creative liberties. 

In regards to Cheney’s mother in law, according to your source, Cheney’s wife communicates in her book: she was confused about her mother’s death, thought there was foul play, and thought her father had a role in it. Sure, she didn’t lay out it all out in the form of an accusation. The director absolutely took creative liberties. But she doesn’t rule out the possibility, and if she felt conflicted enough to put that much down in her memoir, I think it’s fair game. On an equally subjective note, I can’t imagine Cheney’s wife would even spell it out that clearly, even if she really did feel that way. Public figures don’t raise unsubstantiated, decades old, murder accusations against their deceased fathers. It just wouldn’t happen under any circumstances. I think the important thing to note here is the continuing theme of a dysfunctional, secretive family life due to the pressures of being in the political spotlight.

In regards to the 9/11 decision room, I will admit that scene set off my bullshit detector and I do think the director took excessive creative liberties. Calling it lazy screenwriting could be a fair assessment. But for the sake of playing devils advocate, it could have also been an intentional way to communicate the key takeaway of the film, which is that Dick Cheney was the most impactful Vice President the United States has ever had.

At one point we switch to the origin of Fox News, which McKay apparently deemed relevant to Cheney. Why? Because he voted against the ""Fairness Doctrine"" when in Congress back in the 70s.

There's a montage of right-wing media personalities such as Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh.



Cheney, of course, wasn't the only conservative politician to benefit from Fox News. The same way Barack Obama wasn't the only politician to benefit from the invention of the teleprompter.

But because we're given this image of ""Cheney - the mastermind"", McKay tries to make it seem as if Cheney knew his vote against the obscure ""Fairness Doctrine"" would help him sell the Iraq war decades later. It's not just an amazing stretch but also simply not relevant to Cheney's life story.

McKay also mentions the Koch brothers and inserts stock footage of corporate interest groups such as the Heritage Foundation, the CATO Institute and ALEC. He doesn't even name people but just wanted to show ""Old Money Patriarchs"" getting out of expensive cars. In slow-motion.



Again, completely unrelated to Cheney. Many of those organizations existed years before W. Bush's tenure and exist to this day. Yes, they're conservative think tanks. They help write conservative policy which is often representing corporate interests. Certainly a subject worth exploring, as many have over the past few decades. But why are they a part of Vice? Why, other than to somehow muddle anti-corporate sentiments into a messy montage of Cheney-related soundbites that is this film.

Those lines about Heritage or Cato or ALEC? They could be in a biopic about Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney - any modern Republican politician. And each time they'd be out of place.

It (sadly) reminds me of Team America: World Police. Remember that puppet-version of Tim Robbins, the head of the Film Actors Guild (or F.A.G.)? His famous (and hilarious) words: ""Let me explain to you how this works. You see, the corporations finance Team America. And then Team America goes out, and the corporations sit there in their... In their corporation buildings, and, see, they're all corporation-y, and they make money.""

In Team America it was only a silly and over-exaggerated parody of anti-corporate and anti-Bush sentiments in Hollywood. But looking at McKay's writing, it apparently wasn't that far off.

",a9gjba
eg7qk6v,"> “Did you miss the part about ... Bush Sr thanking Cheney for his work in repealing the Fairness Doctrine (allowing Fox News and Info Wars to exist)?”

I just watched this film, and reportedly that’s NOT what happened in reality:

“Did Dick Cheney really convince the House not to override President Reagan's veto of the Fairness Doctrine?

The movie depicts George Bush Sr. thanking Cheney in 1987 for convincing the House not to override President Reagan's veto of the Fairness Doctrine, a law from 1949 that forced broadcast radio and TV outlets to present both sides of an issue equally. **In reality, there's no record of Cheney convincing the House to abstain from interfering with the veto. This is almost certainly untrue, especially given that Cheney wasn't the GOP Whip until 1989.** The movie follows its insinuation by then essentially blaming Cheney for the rise of opinion news, citing Fox News as an example. In addition to this connection to Cheney being outright false, **the filmmakers are also apparently unaware of the fact that the Fairness Doctrine applied only to broadcast licensees.

My problem with Vice is that McKay wants to put the blame of every issue in America today on Cheney, which is just not fair to Cheney or the audience. 

For instance, McKay shows Cheney voting against the ""Fairness Doctrine"" which would later allow opinion news to arise. But Cheney couldn't have voted against that law in the 70s with the intention of later selling the Iraq war in 2003. Fox News didn't just come around solely because of Cheney just as climate change didn't and ISIS didn't.

ecl9bjo,"Showing Heritage and Cato and tax cuts in a film about Cheney is like showing Obamacare and immigration reform in Chappaquiddick. It was out of place as Cheney wasn't the only conservative who supported those things. Virtually every GOP pol post-Reagan did. That's why I think it's unfair and misleading to include them in a biopic about Cheney. 

There is a line by the narrator that says Cheney ""squas actioned"" climate change legislation and regulations. Well, every conservative did. It's unfair to say Cheney was some sort of mastermind behind those things.


Again, you can blame the rise of ISIS on any President. You can blame it on Obama too for leaving in 2011 and creating a vacuum. It wouldn't be fair because that decision was of course not made with that in mind and it wasn't the only factor in the rise of ISIS. 


My issue with the film is that it paints Cheney as the reason for every contemporary conservative policy. I'm glad it didn't make it seem for you like Cheney took all the blame, but reading some of the comments here it seems like it did have that effect on some.

Only congress can declare war. Movie doesn't talk about this, but this was a huge issue back then. The Bush/Cheney administration had to go to great lengths to convince Congress that we needed to go to war with Iraq. 

Once Congress declares war it is the executive branch that calls the shots. Bush/Cheney claimed the Unitary Executive Theory gave them complete control over wartime duties.

egb9fmg,">“In regards to Cheney’s mother in law, according to your source, **Cheney’s wife** communicates in her book: she was confused about her mother’s death, **thought there was foul play,** **and thought her father had a role in it**. Sure, she didn’t lay out it all out in the form of an accusation. **But she doesn’t rule out the possibility**, and if she felt conflicted enough to put that much down in her memoir, **I think it’s fair game** \[…\] I think the important thing to note here is the continuing theme of a **dysfunctional, secretive family** life due to the pressures of being in the political spotlight.”

Please read the source again (as well as Lynne Cheney’s full recollection in the memoir). Where did you read that Lynne Cheney **“thought her father had a role in it”** and that **“she doesn’t rule out the possibility”**? The problem is Adam McKay (the film’s reckless, gung-ho writer) is completely twisting around what she actually wrote:

>Lynne Cheney wrote in her memoir: “Although the official conclusion was that \[my mom’s\] death was an accident, **for years I wondered if she had SOMEHOW been the** **victim of foul play** **\[edit: I’ll explain this term below\]**. **But the more likely explanation is** the medicine she was taking for her blood pressure, which she had complained made her dizzy, and a couple drinks she had around dinnertime. I can imagine one of the dogs leaping from the car when she opened the door and her giving chase—and fainting, falling into the pond. The dogs would have raced around frantically, even returning to the car and **shaking her purse**, so that a few days later, **I would find her CHECKBOOK on the floor of the backseat**.”

[https://michaelkleen.com/2018/12/26/did-lynne-cheneys-dad-murder-her-mom\*/\*](https://michaelkleen.com/2018/12/26/did-lynne-cheneys-dad-murder-her-mom/)

>**“My father was DEVASTATED.** Over the years, my mother had become less tolerant of his temper, more likely to walk out herself when he began to shout, and **I suspect that they quarreled before she left, adding a dimension of remorse to his SORROW**,” Lynne wrote.

&#x200B;

>From the previously cited analysis source: “**Lynne certainly NEVER implied that her father could have killed her mother.** The movie is fabricating this out of a statement Lynne had made in her memoir. Unlike the film, she does not mention her father acting strange at the funeral. **In fact, she stated that her father was so devastated over the loss that he ended up drinking himself to death 2 years later.**”

“Foul play” does NOT mean a murder was committed *by a relative* \- it means she was simply questioning whether the death wasn’t an accident or suicide, but a murder *by another person.* Especially by a mugger, given that she specifically voiced her concern and suspicion over finding the checkbook out of the purse. Lynne didn’t say if cash was missing from her mom’s purse, but she probably wouldn’t know how much cash her mom had on her anyway. Basically, it means Lynne Cheney “didn’t rule out the possibility” that her mom was murdered by anyone she met that day during her nature walk in Wyoming, including e.g. a thug / robber / criminal; or a person with a criminal vendetta seeking revenge on the Cheney family; or a group of wandering hoodlums, etc. Her questioning is against *the public* *in general*. At *no point* does she specifically blame her dad.

In fact, if you read her actual statement above, she CLEARLY expresses her opinion that her father had nothing to do with it: she sympathises with her father’s **“sorrow”** and **“devastation”** (“sorrow” and “devastation” are NOT words you use about your own mom’s killer, but about a grieving family member), and thinks he felt **“a dimension of remorse”** not over a ‘murder’, but about bickering with his spouse and never getting a chance to make things right before her untimely death.

Also, the dead mom (Edna Vincent) reportedly “**worked for the Casper (Wyoming) POLICE Department for 15 years and later the SHERIFF’s department**, and was a **member of the Wyoming Peace Officers’ Association**.” So, by referring to “foul play”, Lynne was possibly speculating if her mom’s death was an *anti-police revenge crime,* targeting her mom as a supporting worker in law enforcement.

TL;DR: McKay twists that family narrative on its head to insinuate that a real (now long dead) person (Wayne Edwin Vincent) was a ‘probable murderer’ - ‘hated, blamed and ostracised by his daugher and her family’, despite the fact that it’s completely baseless. **That’s not “creative liberty”** or “fair game”, **that’s** **reckless, malevolent storytelling against real people and illegal defamation.** ‘Luckily’ for McKay, Vincent is dead so he can’t even defend himself against such out-of-the-blue criminal insinuations or sue McKay.

Moreover, the film is about Cheney, not about his *wife’s parents or cousins or grand-aunts*. So why take such EXTREME, defamatory so-called “liberties” about *in-laws* who are not even relevant to the story? What did that episode add to the film? Nothing except **gratutious and completely unsubstantiated ‘guilty-by-association’ smearing**. It was treated like a trivialised ’true’ side story (with the lecturing narration and onscreen captions) that just **‘casually’ smeared a dead man as a likely murderer and implicated his whole family in a cold-blooded cover up of their own mom’s ‘murder’.**

**That’s a very low blow by McKay.** I’m personally anti-Cheney and was always anti-Iraq war - but throwing around baseless incriminations about his extended family and presenting them as a **“true story or as true as can be, we did our best” (as the movie itself proudly boasts and brands itself in the opening credits)** to a naïve, impressionable audience is just irresponsible and not “doing your best”.

McKay tries very hard to cast suspicion on the whole family, even projecting on the full screen a lecturing statement that the Cheneys never insisted on a full investigation by the police. However, what was there to “investigate” exactly, according to McKay? No witnesses apparently, **no DNA testing available back in 1973 (it would only start 13 years later, ca. 1986)**. Based on the found body itself, according to the Coroner, there was “nothing to indicate foul play” (i.e. no injuries on the body, it seems). The mom was in her 50s - people in their 50s do die themselves sometimes. Lynne seemed to trust her dad and his grief and perhaps (as any normal daughter) did not believe he could even be a suspect, especially since he was married to her mom for decades and died very soon after. What motive did he have? The movie doesn’t concern itself with such ‘inconvenient details’ that don’t fit its tunnel-vision narrative. It’s more concerned with flinging any gossip it could find (true or not true, doesn’t matter apparently) at Cheney and see what sticks. (Which is laughable, since Cheney is already ‘villain’ enough based on his war record, there was really no need for such over-the-top fantasies.)

McKay apparently tried to exploit this personal family tragedy to portray how ‘dysfunctional and cold-blooded’ the whole Republican / Cheney family was towards others (except for their own precious daughters):  ‘as if’ they swept all their ‘dirty family murder secrets’ under the rug and allowed the dad / FIL to get away with the murder of their own mom / MIL just to save their own political ‘image’. And it seems McKay’s insinuation worked - because many trusting viewers now think that is likely 'true'.

But it’s far more likely that the family wasn’t motivated by “secrecy” in this case, but wanted *closure* after an unsolvable tragedy. Lynne didn’t seem to hate her father or even believe that he’s the culprit; there were no leads on which stranger or local criminal could have killed the mom; there was no evidence to warrant an arrest or even who to investigate (the coroner said the body had no evidence of an attack, so without a 'lucky' perp confession or a by-chance witness, there's no murder case). They accepted the death and moved on, rather than dwell on it and become “dysfunctional”.

**And if they were so “secretive” - why did Lynne open up about this in a revealing memoir? She clearly did not do it to fling mud at her deceased father, but it seems out of lingering concern that her mother, a police dep’t worker and a relative of a famous politician, was possibly targeted (“foul play”).**

The family also does not seem in reality to be “dysfunctional”, but quite functional and cohesive (regardless of what one might think of them). Even the lesbian daughter is apparently Republican like the rest of her family, surprisingly enough.",a9gjba
egb9hi1,"What’s ironic is that McKay wasted more time on this uncorroborated father-in-law murder-fantasy (and other ghost-hunt BS similar to this) than on Cheney’s Iraq warmongering and the Halliburton connection. Cheney’s *proven* role in the Iran Gulf War was ignored completely. Instead, writer/director McKay tried (and failed) to pin the 'outing' of a CIA female spy on Cheney (which was not proven, and another person confessed to being behind this). Cheney’s main “vice” wasn’t his extended family or baseless wild-goose chase allegations against him  - it was his *proven* involvement in the wars. But McKay sped through those as if the wars bored him, instead opting to **paint a cartoonish, over-simplistic, omnipotent villain too often based on old wives’ gossip. Cheney was also reportedly not an all-powerful master puppeteer like McKay tried to paint him.** That was a lazy early SNL-parody interpretation:

&#x200B;

>Washington Post: ""There’s no question that Cheney was influential — probably the most powerful vice president in history \[as you rightly said in your post\]. But when Bush called himself the decider, he was correct. Cheney gave advice; Bush made decisions. Bush certainly gave Cheney major leadership roles, such as chairing the administration’s energy task force. **But over the course of his presidency, Bush ran virtually every meeting the 2 men participated in, with Cheney usually listening in silence. Cheney offered to resign 3 times before the 2004 election,** and Bush chose to keep him. And, barring the Iraq troop surge, **Bush’s 2nd term featured a string of defeats for Cheney on foreign policy and national security, including wiretapping, Iran, Syria, North Korea and the Mideast peace process.""**

ecoasn3,"Maybe it’s because the film tries to present itself as an unbiased factual account when it’s just as partisan as Fox/CNN/MSNBC; it’s pretty evident at the end of the film when the director literally includes a scene made to disarm any criticism of the film from a republican standpoint while strawmanning all republicans in the process. 

Maybe it’s because Adam McKay also makes it out like Cheney was some sort of unknown force in the shadows and that the public had little knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes, yet in the public footage shown of Cheney’s first pitch it’s quite clear the public viewed him as a scumbag. 

Maybe it’s because for basically the entire movie you’re literally spoonfed what your supposed to think of Cheney; I didn’t need Meth Damon morally grandstanding the entire film about how shitty Cheney was as a person, Bale’s performance and the script should speak for itself on that part.

Throughout the entire film you’re told not to question the message it’s conveying, whether directly or indirectly. It’s pretty ironic considering early on in the film it highlights republicans getting rid of a law that required newscasters to fairly present both sides of political debate (because of the first amendment, something the film intentionally glosses over, but then makes liberal use of through the narrator, and liberal stand in character at the end of the movie)",a9gjba

Firstly, it showed how Cheney's ambitions and vision existed on a national/global scale, like many of Shakespeare's characters (Macbeth, Henry V, Richard III, any number of them) - the only difference being that Shakespeare wrote plays about these men, and McKay makes movies.

But secondly, it shows the limits of Cheney et al's intelligence.  Whereas Shakespeare characters are able to voice their inner thoughts in marvelous poetry, Cheney often expresses himself in mumbled grunts.

This shouldn't be a partisan issue. There is something fundamentally broken about American foreign policy. This film's scope is deliberately limited in time, and purposefully partisan.

My fear is that with movies like this, people will get the idea in their head that state influence in our media to support the warfare state started with the Nixon administration. It did not. This goes back at least to the Wilson administration.

My fear is that with movies like this, people will get the idea in their head that the type of thing we're seeing right now in Venezuela is because of the current occupant of the White House. It is not. American backed coups occurred during the Obama administration, and were ignored by this film. Coups backed by previous administrations are also ignored in this film.

If Clinton were elected, we'd still have this fundamentally broken foreign policy. We wouldn't have this film, though. And everyone would still be pretending this problem doesn't exist.

ed4w6zs,"I believe that you may have a politically motivated definition of ""humanize"" rather than a narratively focused definition. An immense challenge in ever writing a villain as a protagonist is to make the villain relatable or empathetic, whether or not it's satire or drama, which you may be missing because you're certain that the protagonist was otherwise motivated as a result of your own notions, not factual ones, which this movie took great care in researching. Shakespeare was a master of this, but Milton made us root for Satan, Melville made Ahab into a God, Dickens showed us a soul in Scrooge, Dostoevsky made us forgive Raskolnikov, Whitman and Ginsberg made us love the supposed dregs, the proles, the unworthy. There are very many contemporary analogs, especially in television because it allows more time to establish character than a movie; but that's the challenge of a movie and especially a biopic. Yet, there are a million more examples in the arts of artists who are incapable of creating empathy for the subject in the spectator and so, fail, won't be remembered except as failures, whether or not they sold millions in their time or satiated millions in their time.The entire art movement of vanitas was essentially this (and even Picasso, centuries later, lampooned their failed attempts). These artists fail because they're tied too much to their own egotistical sense of morality and especially their conservative ties to religion or what society should be like instead of being capable of understanding where 'evil' comes from, and making us, as consumers, love that evil. They inadvertently demonstrate themselves as the evil influence in attempting to paint the other as evil. Fox News is news to a minority, and every day it airs, demonstrates to the majority its own stupidity, its immorality, its illiteracy.

Based on the facts, there’s obviously not enough evidence to argue that lynne’s father murdered her mother, or that she believed that to be the case. But the mysterious nature of the death makes it impossible to say that he was 100% innocent. In the judicial system it’s innocent until proven guilty but the same rules don’t apply here because it’s just a movie. On the same note, the movie isn’t going as far as making the accusation. It’s just implied (somewhat subtly) and I’m sure a decent amount of viewers missed it. I know I nearly did.

I think Lynne (unintentionally) gave the writer an opportunity to portray her father this way by saying something along the lines of “its possible they got in a fight before she left on her walk” (that’s what I meant by “thought her father had a role”) and also by talking about potential foul play. Is it extremely unlikely that he murdered his wife, yes. Is it morally wrong for the writer to imply such a thing, yes. Did the writer twist her words, yes. But did it make the movie more interesting/memorable, definitely. That’s why I see it as taking creative liberties. 

Also since you brought this up, I honestly don’t see him being “devastated” as evidence of innocence. For all we know, his sorrow stemmed from his guilt after having made a drunken mistake. There’s plenty of true crime docs on netflix that show this is a possibility.

I don't want to sound like one of those ""greed is good"" finance douches, but the problem with abandoning a profit motive and nationalizing an industry is that incentives become very vague. You see a lot of government resources spent not to improve outcomes, but to make it so one gov organization has jurisdiction on a certain issue.  Higher ups have no incentive to produce more than okay.  As a result they may stop after ""okay"" and focus on things that directly benefit them, you often see administrators higher people below them and pay those people a ton to justify increasing their own wages (look at higher education, money spent on instruction has remained pretty flat over the past 30 years, tuition has definitely not.)  Middle management has the same incentive and also little incentive to try to cut costs.  Because there is less incentive for profit, you usually see less reason to keep costs down.  As a result, there is a lot less of a chance of getting fired for everyone b/c firing people sucks emotionally (this is often called ""featherbedding"").  These things add up over time as the system becomes less and less efficient.  

One way that a lot of socialist countries got around this lack of a carrot, was with a hard stick.  If you didn't work hard in the USSR, East Germany, Poland, Cuba, and now Venezuela, you and/or your family could be imprisoned/executed.  This is definitely a dramatization of ""stick"" incentives, but I do think that other ""stick"" incentives (lose section 8, SNAP, Medicaid...) would contrast with your ""people motive"" mentality.

The Iraq war sections were better than what came before but just didn't have the impact that they were intended to. If the point is to depict Cheney as a monster (which he is), there's very little attention paid to the real-life consequences of his actions, and what emphasis is given isn't all that well connected to the decisions he made. It's just him saying assholish things in meetings. If they had intercut some of the Iraq war politicking (like Colin Powell's UN Speech) with Collateral Murder footage or the Nisour Square Massacre it would have made more sense and clearly identified the stakes. Overall, it was very unfocused and surface-level, largely because it tried to do too many things at once.

Also, the Iraq war sequences make it very clear that Adam McKay doesn't have a very sophisticated understanding of the war on terror. The logic behind the war on terror was [""if you don't support us you support al-qaeda](https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-a-2001-09-21-14-bush-66411197/549664.html)"".

egce9pp,"I didn’t say that “devastation” was “evidence of innocence” - it was evidence of a daughter’s trusting relationship with her father, which was twisted in this *biopic* into a bizarrely acrimonious, “dysfunctional” one. Is heavy-handed (not subtle at all) incriminations about families and real people’s deaths entertaining? Not for me. It made me feel duped by a callous writer who thinks his audience is not intelligent enough to be ‘entertained’ by a biopic closer to the truth.

That’s my concern about this film: it’s not just any regular semi-historical fantasy movie like Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove - it’s a biopic that *expressly* promoted and billed itself as “a true story” (even taking on a deliberately deceptive quasi-documentary style, with lecturing narration, explanatory onscreen captions and using real footage of events). But in reality many of the heavy-handed onscreen captions and portrayal of *historical events* was twisting or fabricating ‘information’ - too much and too often.

The usual opening-credits disclaimer for ‘historical fantasy’ films is “this is a fictional account *inspired* by true events”, not “this is a true story”. I watched it in London and it definitely duped A LOT of people here. When a writer/director expressly vouches in the beginning “we did our best [to make it] as true as can be” and then proceeds to spoon-feed fabrication after fabrication to the worldwide audience (who usually take historical biopics in good faith) - that’s just either lazy writing or intentional propaganda. Another caption onscreen hurled incriminations against the ex-VP: “he never apologised for [accidentally shooting a person who walked in on their hunting group]” - no, he did take responsibility for that.

I don’t care about Cheney (he can rot in hell for Iraq), but I do care about *over-the-top*, baseless lying in self-touted “true story” *biopics*. When I pay to watch a historical film billed as a “true story” - I don’t want to be used as a pawn instead in a clearly partisan ‘information war’. There’s so much fake news nowadays that this is not helping and just further intentionally muddying the waters and the public’s confusion about historical figures and political parties.",a9gjba

You just argued they were because Cheney once met Roger Ailes and votes against the ""Freedom Doctrine"", which is precisely how the movie misleads audiences.

The parts about FOX aren't exactly wrong in that they are biased, but there is no clear benefit to the movie besides a quick tool to pander to the audience. Let's say the movie was about Hillary and her corruption, and the movie just talked about tax increases and ANTIFA activists harassing people or something.

I would disagree with that. ISIS formed from Al-Qaeda, which certainly wasn't the result of the Iraq war. Islamic terrorists attacking the West go back to the 1993 WTC bombing. Not saying Iraq wasn't a factor, but it wasn't the only one and thus Cheney didn't create ISIS. 

> With regards to Obama leaving Iraq, the Iraqi PM demanded the right to put US soldiers on trial using Iraqi law if they were going to stay longer. 

No one in the U.S. military cares what the Iraqi PM says. People were hyping up that countries would be able to sue the U.S. if the Senate passed a law allowing 9/11 families to sue Saudi officials. That was years ago and so far I don't remember the U.S. being sued the life out of it. But again, I wouldn't call Obama the creator of ISIS neither. I'm saying when you're President or a high ranking military officials any decision can and will play a role in the future of the region.

Personally I would have preferred a focus on Cheney as a person and his person life and how those things relate to his public life. Not montages of Fox News, Heritage and Mission Accomplished. Cheney did way more if his life than be VP. I appreciated the bits with Lynne , his daughters and Rumsfeld and would have liked to see a narrative created around them rather than the same we saw in other films about Iraq such as W. or Fahrenheit 9/11.


I said that the American public was presented intelligence about WMDs in Iraq which made it very difficult for mainstream figures to oppose the war, especially after 9/11. 


Even Powell, in 2011, [said](https://youtu.be/MrvBPYuRPUw?t=1121) it was the worth to go into Iraq. (Although he did regret the UN speech and other things.)


I'm not justifying it. I'm not saying it's okay to go into a war without being certain of something or acting on unvetted information. But I think it's also dangerous not to understand the context of things and simply blaming all the world's problems on one man. 

That's my problem with the movie. It trying to say that Cheney and Fox are solely responsible for Iraq and ISIS when they're not. ",a9gjba

ecklab7,"What makes you think Cheney has anything else in his personal life worth sharing?  Shouldn’t a political biopic be politics focused?

The fact that you’re still firm in your belief that the movie is blaming all the world’s problems on one man when it clearly wasn’t shows just how far gone you are. 

I guess all those parts with Bush and Rumsfeld didn’t make the cut of the movie you saw...

Edit: and what is wrong with you that you are downplaying the impact of rushing into a war?  Hundreds of thousands of civilians died. Thousands of Americans died. The long-term economic cost is estimated at $6,000,000,000,000 (that’s trillion). 

A large scale invasion and overthrow of a sovereign nations should be the absolute last resort. But you refuse to share your age so it’s clear you’re not aware of just how rushed it was. It was a forced war and countless people died. That’s something you can’t take back. Why do you have so little respect for human life?

Also, if the war was necessary why wasn’t it properly authorized by the UN?  Why didn’t France, Germany, and Canada join the coalition?  ",a9gjba

ecl86vj,"You force to make this about the Iraq war rather than the movie so I'll stop with this reply. 

But let me just say this: I never said the Iraq war was justified, just that it took more than just Dick Cheney to orchestrate it. Every war we're involved in results in military and civilian death. Some wars are more popular than others. The Iraq war was based on faulty intelligence and is certainly not a shining point in recent American history. BUT to say only Dick Cheney was behind it when virtually the entire country supported it also isn't fair. That's the only point I'm trying to make. Take care. ",a9gjba
ecm1bg9,"No my main problem is the pacing of the film and it being poorly made. But to respond to you being a moron for a moment. 

You said ""Real people don't fit so neatly into a box.""
and I said it was the job of the film to make it more interesting ""The point of the movie maker is to make these things flow and they just don't.""
Then you talked about bush??????? and started acting like an annoying child.

So to simplify my point again so your small brain can understand. They did a poor job making this movie and they needed to make it flow better. The changes they made didn't help the movie and they should have made better choices in making this film so it worked better. Whether it was streamlining the flow or adding scenes. If you can't understand this I can use hand puppets. I’ve never rolled my eyes so hard lmao.",a9gjba
eclyno9,"It showed plenty of other people talk about the war. It has multiple scenes of Rumsfeld pushing for it, including bullying Powell about it. 

If Cheney had been given the power by Bush to captain that ship then why wouldn’t he deserve the blame?  ",a9gjba
ecm19r8,"> If Cheney had been given the power by Bush to captain that ship then why wouldn’t he deserve the blame?

Because of what you just mentioned. It wasn't just Cheney that supported going into Iraq, it was a majority of that cabinet and a majority of Congress and a majority of celebrities. Plus, the intelligence at the time claimed there were WMD. So all in all, the blame doesn't just fall on Cheney. ",a9gjba

It showed Powell and Rumsfeld resigning.",a9gjba
