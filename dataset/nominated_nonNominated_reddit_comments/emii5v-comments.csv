fdpe778,"Overall, I thought it was good for what it was. Always love a good Creature Feature. Definitely can compare to Alien, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Loved the creatures. Wish they were shown a little less in the movie to keep with the mystery of their appearance. But, when they were hidden and snuck around with very little to be seen, it was admittedly tense. The deaths were surprisingly brutal. Reminded me of Life in that regard. Was really into that. Slow motion shots were done very well and the cinematography was definitely there. Also, a very surprising ending with revealing >!the giant Cthulhu type monster. That honestly shocked me. And to see Kristen Stewart sacrifice herself to destroy the base and the monsters.!< It did have it's problems. Sometimes it was hard to understand some of the dialogue. Some of the jokes didn't land, but most did. I'm a TJ Miller fan, so it was very reminiscent to his role in Cloverfield. Solid enough for me to stay entertained through it's hour and a half runtime. Would watch it again. 6.5/10 for me.",emii5v
fds74zx,"Great creature design and effects. Cool shots.  Pretty nice cast. Paper thin story and characters. Kristen Stewart is the sexiest woman on Earth and TJ Miller has been playing the same character for a decade.

fdqxub9,"Interesting observation:

>!When they first meet the captain (Lucien), he says that he got 20+ people out using the escape pods.  But at the end of the movie, news reports say that only 2 survivors were found (Smith and Emily).  This implies that the creatures snatched all of the people Captain Lucien thought he saved, and would have gotten Smith and Emily's pods as well, making Norah's sacrifice all the more necessary.!<

>!Only thought about this when one my friends said ""Those pods were going pretty fast, I don't think the monsters could have caught them so why did Norah have to blow herself up?""!<

I did have a few questions of my own though:

>!Captain Lucien stated ""There's nothing there"" when asked about an old mining station; however that's exactly where Norah ends up after she blacks out.  There, she finds Lucien's old nametag and uniform, meaning he worked there.  Was he hiding this information on purpose?  Why was that station abandoned?  Why did it appear so isolated on the map and away from all other points of interest?  What was he working on?  He also seemed particularly un-phased by the discovery of the creatures, almost as if he already knew about their existence.  !<

>!I'm particularly intrigued by the creatures, especially the Queen/Alpha.  Most deep-sea creatures are scavengers, feeding on dead or decaying material that sinks from above, but these things were obviously predatory in nature, which makes me wonder what they would be hunting down there.  Were they drawn to that location due to the drilling or were they in long-term hibernation and disturbed when the mining began?!<",emii5v

fe5re15,"Really liked this movie. One of my favorite little untold details was how the station reactors had a UI to turn it into a bomb, including blast radius, simple initiation, count down, and sensors on the pods to detect ""approaching entities"".  There were obviously hints before the end that the captain/company knew about the creatures and likely were ""drilling"" as a coverup for studying them, but I thought the bomb details were a nice touch.",emii5v
fdznqnk,I found this to be quite solid and I really appreciated that it was short and tight and fast paced. Ad astra just dragged in my opinion and this was the complete opposite.

Jump scares got me a bunch of times.  Including a scene they are all walking underwater and one of the creatures appears like 3 times within 2 minutes.

fe49wi0,"The chaotic ""shit hits the fan"" sequence in the beginning of the film where we saw Kristen slippin', slidin', and yelling throughout the halls was my favorite part of the movie. I really felt the urgency of the entire scene.

fdrleqv,"SPOILER REVIEW AHEAD!!!!!

tl:Dr The set pieces and underwater scenes look fantastic, Everyone but TJ Miller does a fairly good job, the plot is simple but effective keeping up the pace with only a small amount of clunky dialogue, it doesn't bog you down with exposition or extended backstoriea, the monsters are a little simple >!but the big one makes up for it.!< If you are fan of Alien and other Sci Fi monster movies, this one is worth watching.

I really enjoyed this movie. Now I can admit I am quite biased as I love deep sea horror such as Deep Star Six and Leviathan. Plus I got stuck watching The Grudge remake last week and this is Video Gold in comparison. That said this is very good movie for fans of Alien style movie. The sets are absolutely gorgeous; you can really believe these characters are underwater. The underwater scenes are pitch black where there is no light so the audience is just as blind as the characters. But, besides the fact that it's what it would be like down there, it doesn't do it to hide bad effects from the audience or anything. 

The characters are pretty good throughout. Nora (Kristen Stewart) tries to do her best to stay calm >!but at once she reaches the old drill site she essentially breaks down, before bucking up, determined to stay alive.!< Jessica Henwick's character Emily does a good job of someone fraying at the seams, managing to just hold herself together >!and survives despite the movie making me think she wouldn't. Vincent Cassell's captain Sam is a little bland at times >!and makes what is easily the dumbest decision is the movie, going back for a bolt gun after rescuing someone a creature pulled away.!< But he manages to portray a fairly good Rock for the others to rely on. John Gallagher Jr plays Smith, who is in love with Emily and their relationship is quite believable, and a good friend of Nora's. He plays a guy way out of his wheelhouse but does the best he can to hold it together and helps other do the same. >!Unfortunately, hespends the latter half of the movie mostly unconscious due to oxygen deprivation.!<
>!Mamoudou Athie's character is dead in the first fifteen minutes so barely remember his name.!< And TJ Miller is not a great addition to this movie. His sole role is comic relief and while he has some actually good lines, many fall flat >!and I was glad to seem him go around the hallway point.!< 

Plot wise they don't waste any time. The movies starts, Kristen Stewart monologues for a minute or two, and then the whole place falls apart. From their is almost non stop, with the exception of a few slower moments so the audience isn't overwhelmed, >!as they try to escape the main building an reach one over a mile away that is still intact.!< They don't waste time trying to figure and explain what happened, instead focusing on their survival. A few pieces of dialogue are bit clunky such as TJ Miller, and some story from Nora about her dead finance, but they are few enough that they don't drag it down too much.

As for the creatures, I both like and dislike them. They have a basic design of a humanoid upper body and some kind of jellyfish like lower body, although it's hard to tell as we only ever get a good solid look at their upper bodies. However their appearance is kinda bland to me. They are too similar to humans in my opinion, I would have preferred if they were more like deep sea creatures in design. And there are a couple of times were the CGI falls thru, although there is a decent amount of practical effect in this as well >!The Big One is seriously cool though. Again I'm biased since I love giant monsters, but even so the design is much better. While we don't see it's lower body almost at all, what see off its upper body is distinctly alien in design. Large tentacles on its back, multiple eyes, huge three part mouth covered in teeth, tentacle beard, and strange looking hands. The movie does a good job at hinting about it as they mention how the station is 70% compromised in minutes, or that a 6000 ton drill was uprooted with extreme force.!< 

Overall, while it is not redefining the genre or doing anything revolutionary, this is a very enjoyable movie. If you are a fan of Sci Fi monster movies like Alien, I would seriously recommend you give this movie a look.",emii5v
fdqqi5y,"I went in with absolutely bottomed out expectations. I Expected a complete January dud. Instead I got the best sci-fi thriller I've seen in years. I've been out of the theatre for 12 hours now and the little details keep resurfacing and putting a smile on my face.

 I expect it to be a cult classic in the same vein of Sunshine or Donnie Darko. 

The production design was fantastic (I eat up psudo-realistic sci-fi). The creatures, the suits, the station, everything was brimming with robust industrial style. The cinematography was fantastic. Each claustrophobic tunnel and wide open ocean scene added weight and tension to every scene.

The characters are pretty stereotypical tropes (the mechanic, the joker, the captain) But most of the cast have moment that allow them to escape their preconceived tropes to make them memorable. 

The audio design enhanced the cinematography to create real tension. The score! The aquatic ambience suited the film and really enhanced the experience for me.  

This is really a case of critics not understanding sci-fi. It's not a character drama. There are quite a few small moments where you can see these characters are family. Shown through action and not bogged down with blocks of dialog.

The last time I saw a movie more than once in a theatre was Dunkirk (That was only because of Regal's Oscar reruns). I can't wait to get lost in this movie again.",emii5v
fev33mw,"Good thing they had a convenient 'melt down the core button'... that seems too easy. Also the read out to show the monsters chasing the pods and the blast radius, good thing they programmed that! Stewart's character was shown to be smart, able to hot wire stuff and rig up the other suit etc. then to just not use that at the end really seemed like a weird miss. Also black guy dies first?

fdpd4ym,"I saw someone on Twitter describe this as the ideal January sci-fi thriller and I’d agree. It’s a rewrite away (and some technical fixes, good god that sound mix is bad) from being very good but it’s only 90 minutes and it’s totally fine fun if you have time to kill. I do wish there were more characters in this so there could be a higher body count. There wasn’t enough gruesomeness to go around. I wanted more shit like the guy being pressurized to death and TJ Miller being ripped out of his suit.

I also thought this was going to go in a totally out there place for a while, too. There’s this line Kristen Stewart has at the beginning talking about how you never really have a sense of time underwater, and then Vincent Cassell being confused over how old his daughter would be. It seemed like they’d have this cool twist at the end where things aren’t really what they seemed but it never came.

fdpgheo,"Copy pasted from my previous post.



I was pleasently surprised by the film. I feel like it reminded me of LIFE/Gravity with an abyss like setting thrown in.....oh and a dash of cthulu 

Pros:

Awesome costume design

Characters weren't stupid

Genuinely scared me twice

Awesome set design

I liked the plot for what it was

Cons:

Everyone besides paul and the captain were a little bland

In-suit scenes were sometimes hard to see

Ending was rushed

.......


I REALLY liked that the characters weren't brain dead. There was a decent amount of moments where they didn't do the obvious dumb tropey thing. Also once again the diving suits looked absolutely awesome.

I think the film delivered on what it set out to do and was rather well paced.

I'd give it a solid 8/10, though I am a huge sucker for underwater films.",emii5v

fdzswlz,"So it sounds like there's universal agreement the end monster was Cthulhu? I was confused the entire movie as to why the monsters would have arms, legs, and opposable thumbs, yet be from the bottom of the ocean. The movie in no way was marketed, written, or executed as if it was dealing with cosmic beings. To me it makes it worth a second watch. 

Also, was there a random octopus monster like halfway through after the captain gets dragged away? Kristin Stewart runs away from it and it's never seen again. That gave me the impression that there were many different types of undiscovered sea lifeforms down there, further taking me out of the Cthulhu mentality.",emii5v

fdpznwh,"Man, I really cannot trust film critics anymore.

Excellent little Alien/The Abyss inspired horror thriller with zero fat around/before the action (>!as in all the exposition is done by the end of the opening credits!<) which I can't say I would have expected to like but they did well enough when it came to character development during the run of the movie that it worked... 

Was pretty spooky, the CGI was obviously made easier by the darkness of being at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. >!The monsters definitely suffered from ""shown to be incredibly powerful but then is scared of like, a flashlight, or people looking at it, or whatever, until it's time to pick someone off then its fearless"" syndrome. And they even said it was attracted to the light, why would it avoid flashlight beams?!< I've definitely seen better monsters in movies, but they did the job and were at least a little freaky looking. Couple of the deaths were very good, dying underwater can be very gross.

I don't know if it's just because I went in expecting way less or what but I thought it was very well acted. TJ Miller was trying his darndest, but wasn't that funny on the whole - but I still thought the movie did an excellent job portraying how people handle stress differently. Paul was a great portrayal of the type of person who automatically goes to gallows humor, Emily was the person who can't shut up about random topics because they need to talk to avoid their fear. 

Biggest positive about the film: the characters feel extremely real and don't make any dumb horror movie choices. They act like real people would in their situation in a way not many horror movies reach.


I can't think of another Kristen Stewart movie I've seen since Twilight. She was much, much better in this and was given a much more relatable, human character to work with. I thought she was like an anti-actor, or like being possessed by the spirit of an especially boring brick wall before seeing Underwater. Which btw, dumb name.

When Norah stops at Shepherd Base (the abandoned rig) it would have been awesome if she had discovered some signs that the company knew what was down there. Some cult iconography and such, some evidence of legends. The way they lingered on the captain's locker was suggestive, but there wasn't really anything to see.

I did have one big question though. Near the end, just before Norah makes it into the final base and we see the huge monster, there is an explosion that saves her. Where did that come from? Did the other girl do it? Or was it the monster shooting something at Norah? It seemed to come out of nowhere and wasn't ever mentioned after that.",emii5v

I thought the fact the film only hinted that the captain knew what was going on also helped. There was something about him that didn't sit right throughout and the film leaves it to your imagination.

The opening sequence goes *hard* in on Aliens-esque vibes. Her crew jacket. The hallways look like they were painted in late 70s/early 80s mall parking lot designs. The computer she has to reboot has the display and font feel of an upright arcade game. But then everything else later is beautifully modern..? Such a disconnect that just made all those nods seem more ham fisted.

This movie felt longer than its runtime.

There was a lot of good and a lot of mediocre. I wish it was distributed all in one section; Poor 1st act that gets better or vice versa, but as-is it kept ebbing and flowing between the two and ultimately suffers for it on the whole. 

T.J. Miller, just, ugh. 

Kristen Stewart is not terrible but she’s not great. Most of the small cast is just there. The captain and the other girl were the only interesting ones for me. 

The >!reveal of the giant Cthulhu-like creature towards the end was genuinely creepy!<.

The pacing is a little too fast at times, and it could have used just a little more exposition, but overall I think the audience rating at Rotten Tomatoes (60%) is right.",emii5v

fdto2q4,"Kristen Stewart is great in this.  Between this and Charlie's Angels, I hope that she gets more action roles, and better scripts to work with, because I think that she could be good at it.

Also she pulls off the short hair/shaved head look VERY well, it looks great on her.

The rest of the film was, decent.  Some good claustrophobic moments, the monster looked pretty good, the underwater setting works well, etc.  But the script was, meh, and there were some inconsistencies.

I'd give it a ""B"" probably.  And it's better than most January horror films are, that's for sure.",emii5v
fe5iflz,"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It was difficult to orient myself within the movie, which added to the chaotic atmosphere the movie created.

fec9k9h,"Overall I enjoyed it. Great costume, set, and creature design. Wish there was more world building. Also I wish they would have made it easier to tell which character was which when they had the suits on. Something as easy as everyone has a different color glowstick or different light emitting from their suit. Could have played into the creatures seeing the light too. I just think it would have made it easier to tell who was involved in some of the scenes. But overall, pretty solid.",emii5v
fprusiv,"I went in with really low expectations and ended up liking it more than I thought.

6/10.",emii5v
feos5s6,TJ Miller annoyed me a little (still funny) and it could have used more horror elements but overall I still enjoyed the movie!,emii5v
fdpi7x4,"Good timing and pace, enjoyable but the low critic rating is warranted.

The movie felt more like a video game, it would have been a good Dead Space game with some stupid quick time events.  Monsters are just showing up in places they could not have gotten into or if they had would have been flooded with water, there are artificial scarcities and they go from point to point with a boss fight at the end.",emii5v

fp8cy20,"This movie was a mess.

Great idea, terrible execution. Should have given the idea to someone else. 

The actors were great, but it's how they were played out. 

The characters who actually provided sustenance to the movie died first so that was the stupidest shit. 

Then the character who didn't do shit but whine and the character I forgot was even a part of the crew were the only ones to make it. 

I had nothing to grasp on to have the incentive to root for any of the characters. 

5/10. 

Aesthetically, though, I'd definitely give it a 10/10.",emii5v

fdphkw2,"I thought it was a pretty entertaining movie. Admittedly I don’t typically gravitate towards monster flicks but had some spare time to see this one. I enjoyed the set pieces and the grit and grime in a facility that would certainly beg for perfection seeing as it was the edge of the world. A comment on corporate laziness I suppose. I thought TJ Miller was a good take on the comedic relief for such a movie and Kristen Stewart did well with what she was given. My only gripe plot-wise is the total lack of any other characters outside the main cast, in a place that should have plenty. I guess most were able to escape while she was blacked out from the first fall she took at the very beginning? Overall I agree with some of the prior commenters here; It had the potential to trend more towards a good character film but traded those moments in for action. 7/10",emii5v

fh9rozd,"Much better than I thought it would be.  I have a thing for underwater horror, and this one hit all the right notes.  It's a lean, to the point movie, but in this genre, that's a good thing.  The characters didn't do anything stupid (arguable that bringing back the first creature wasn't dumb), the design was stellar (THOSE SUITS!!!), and the monster reveal at the end was awesome.  It set out with a purpose and hit it on the nose.  I love that the movie turns the tension up immediately and keeps it there pretty much until the final scene.",emii5v

fekwd74,"My two cents before I read the comments:

I fucking loved this movie. I had more fun here then with Rise of Skywalker. The tension was great, acting was believable, the monsters HOLY SHIT the monsters, the claustrophobic atmosphere.

I was 100% satisfied...ok maybe like 95% satisfied because the way it ends seemed a bit too convenient (authorize facility meltdown from an escape pod room?). But other then that hot damn was it a fun ride.

fg03a81,"Just came back from it now, one thing I’m surprised about is how under marketed this movie is, it came out last week in my state here in Australia and now the only session times are after 9pm for it. I don’t think seen a poster or any form of advertising for it prior to the trailer I was tagged. in on Facebook months ago.

Ultimately this is a shame as it’s a pretty decent movie. The setting and creature design is cool/fresh. I love creature films and I would’ve loved if they showed different life at the bottom of the ocean besides the one thing Kirsten Stewart woke up next to her after SPOILER losing the captain. It might’ve been cool to have a giant squid these creatures destroyed.

I thought it might be a possibility a creature made it into the ship besides the one that got TJ Miller however not the case. Actually speaking on that how did a sizeable creature, enough to pull him out of his suit, get into the base? The water was flowing through a crack into the little section they had to swim through, those creatures were pretty big so strange they left it as soon as TJ Miller died they didn’t really want to bother with the one in with them.

Anyways I enjoyed it and I will always try to get to the creature feature movies so we have more of them in the future but it’s a shame this didn’t get the attention I feel it’s worthy of. Hopefully streaming services bring attention to it as it did seem they were pushing for the sequel set up at the end with the newspaper clippings but to likely no avail based off it flopping",emii5v

fdpyo5x,"Whoa I kinda LOVED this. 

Brutal deaths despite PG-13? Check. 

Surprisingly solid cinematography? Check. 

A badass role that actually fits Kristen Stewart’s strengths? Check. 

There were a notable amount of fade to blacks that make me wonder about the editing process, but what we got here I still thought was really fun and scary. Tons of moments genuinely made me jump, and the movie is constantly keeping things tense the entire time. 

And that opening!! Starts with a bang and never lets up. It’s everything child me wanted Deep Star Six and Leviathan to be. It looks expensive and is pretty much the best Syfy movie ever made. Totally worth a ticket in my book.",emii5v
fefxtn8,"I really wanted to love this movie. Everything about it felt like something I would kill to see on the big screen... the CG wasn't laughably bad like I expected, the costumes looked incredible like something believable, the sets looked pretty real, and the underwater scenes looked like they were actually underwater in the dark, scary depths. The acting was... alright, but I dont think it needed to be anything A+.

...but I just left feeling somewhat disappointed. It's like they people who made this movie glanced over an HP Lovecraft inspired piece of art and went ""Yeah, that's what's scary. Underwater monsters!"" Like, it feels painfully hollow compared to what I felt like it could've been. The thing that kills me is that there are even little moments here that suggested they were interested in making it more of an Eldritch related horror movie, rather than a generic hunted by scifi monster movie. 

The locker room scene with the main character toward the end is a perfect example. Are we going to just so easily glance over A MAP WITH WEIRD ELDRITCH DRAWINGS THAT POINTS TO SOMETHING BIGGER? The captain clearly knew about the creature and there are other small details suggesting he was holding info from the group about big old sea boy. Why wasnt this the plot that was explored? The movie could do with more time delving into the weird and unsettling nature of these cool creatures they made, but right when it gets interesting it ends.

And that ending... introducing Cthulu or Dagon or whatever original monster it is, in a seriously cool way, only to kill them like... ten minutes later? Uncool. Took the horrifying monster and made it, well, lame. Nothing ""scary"" about it. And that monologue was cringe beyond belief. 

Imagine this: Our main character activates the self destruct feature in the base and sacrifices herself to nuke the big bad sea boy. The screen cuts to black just as it goes off and we see the two lovebirds who made it to the surface. They pop open their escape pods and hold each other, waiting to see their friend, excited they've survived... only her pod doesnt surface and instead we hear this loud, horrible scream come from below the waves. It shakes their pods and when they look down into the water, they see it rising.
 
Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like they took what they thought lovecraftian was supposed to be and made it into a movie, not really bothering to delve deeper into the psychological and otherworldly nature of the genre. It's like they were too afraid to get with the weird that would've made this movie way more fun and enjoyable. I didnt hate it, far from it. It felt like a first draft of something that could've been great, but chose to play it safe...ish.",emii5v

fwfho0f,"Finally watched this film and for a paint by numbers sci-fi monster flick it was suprisingly good but could have really been so much more given the Cthulhu reference.

They should have did an Abyss/Event Horizon type psychological thriller movie where the crew begin to go mad. They could have said that being down this deep causes psychological breakdowns. The crew would start to hallucinate seeing monsters attacking each other and themselves. We are led to believe the same thing from the audience perspective. Then, with 1 or 2 people left alive, they finally make the big reveal showing the big guy but make his appearance seem dreamlike. The last few crew member sacrifice themselves trying to kill Cthulhu. We are left to think was this really all hallucinations and the people really went mad or if Cthulhu is real.

Sprinkling in Cthulhu cult worshipping hints like they did in the movie would add another layer to the mystery of the story.

Given that the movie didn't do well financially, I think that they could have taken this risk and the film may have developed a ""cult"" following similar to how other very well written sci-fi psychological movies have become.",emii5v

fdvjux7,"It was more like that movie ""Life"" than anything else, though I do see the Alien comparison being valid too. Ultimately I liked the movie, but I felt that some points kind of didn't mesh on a cinematography level.

Like when Kristen Stewart has her ""all is lost moment"" alone and they play this super weird  out of place pop anthem, and then at the end during the climax they do the same....These two scenes are really important in any story circle so to break into some kind of weird music and a voice over and drop the  visual tone suddenly the way like they did kind of took me out of the moment.  

It's almost like they took the conspiracy theories around that ""bloop"" sound that happened underwater in real life and made a movie.  I am not sure why they dumped the movie in January, it could have stood in October around Halloween as well.

Overall i give it 3 bags of popcorn and 2  sodas.",emii5v
fel15m8,"First and foremost, I wasn't expecting too much for this film but within the first few minutes we go right to it. I for the most part was able to overlook some of the tech issues given the setting, though the set itself did give it that late 70's early 80's sci-fi feel, but it does match up with even the most 'modern' research and military vessels as far as interior. With the tension of the cascading and catastrophic failure of the station and the issues pressed for survival there is enough tension there is almost no need for monster.

fedtm8g,"I caught it last night and really wasn't impressed, even going in with low expectations.

There's no character development, the dialogue is pretty poor (especially that ending monologue), and there's nothing really original about the premise. The mythos was there and not fully revealed, but I think we needed more of it to have investment in the mission, the characters, etc.

The creature design(s) were really cool, as were the costumes, but that's about it. I never really bought into the paranoia or claustrophobia of being that deep in the sea even though it does scare the living shit out of me in reality.

I like K. Stew in it to a degree, though, but can only hope she goes back to smaller indie-like (not sure that's the right term) films like *Clouds of Sils Maria* and *Personal Shopper*. She was amazing in those two.",emii5v

fdtgbo5,"This movie was awesome and I was frightened in some parts.

It had some shots that gave it this protorealistic pseudo documentary feel to it. And that made the monsters that much more scarier.

It is a low budget film that used every single dime the right way. The script was great, the characters never did anything stupid and it felt believable. Well except the first guy to die, that was stupid, but at least people got a good education about the bottom of the ocean from it.

fdpclkn,"This movie reminded me a lot of Overlord. You know, it's like a smaller genre film and it basically follows our main character up close for the entire runtime and was probably not made for sequels. And that's all pretty rare these days, especially the last one, so I can appreciate it. I didn't think it was as good as Overlord, but it's certainly not laughably bad or anything. I was afraid it might get super dull but then a dudes head caved in and another turned to soup in his suit and I was like, yeah okay I'm in. 


The setting was pretty neat. Walking the Mariana Trench floor felt both claustrophobic from the lack of light and also very wide open in the sense that danger could have come from anywhere. There were hints of Gravity, Alien, The Abyss, all sorts of stuff which isn't a bad thing. I wouldn't call it devastatingly original, but it was original enough that it wasn't making me roll my eyes or I never felt like they were copying something verbatim. 

It did have some major issues. First of all, the movie starts right away. Within like five minutes shit is hitting the fan and it never really calms down after that. There's scenes where the characters are in a safe place but they're always moving forward and in danger. Which is kind of cool, but also really left me at a loss to understand some things. Why were they down there? What happened? Who are these people? Some of these questions are answered in throwaway lines here and there, but without any sort of introduction to the vessel or the characters it was hard to interpret the rest of the movie correctly. 


Wasn't sure where they were or needed to go, how big the station was. I think it was revealed to be a drilling station which is nice and politically relevant, but without any background of what they're drilling or why it's kinda just like *shrug*. 

I know in the trailer there's like hints of a scene where TJ Miller puts on some music through the PA and everyone's getting ready to party, they either only shot that for the trailer or just totally cut it out. A curious choice to say the least, it may have been tropey but it might have been good to see everyone before they were in crisis mode. Like, there's a scene where they bring one of the creatures on board and it's dead and they're inspecting it and the Asian actress touches one of its thorns with her bare hand and I was getting Prometheus flashbacks. It didn't cause anything bad to happen, but I didn't know how to feel about it because I didn't know if she was competent at what she did, or even what she did for the station. 

Anyways, if you're a fan of some of the movies this reminds you of it's probably worth a go for you. This probably won't be anyone's favorite movie but it will join a line of suspenseful and claustrophobic movies that are just fine for a watch. I'd give it an even 6/10.

fdukm9j,"After a long day of tending to the pigs and repairing the thatching of my favorite cottage - I found some time to visit the theatre district and see a performance of the show ""Underwater""

I'm exhausted though, and the roosters will be crowing soon enough, so let's dive into this knave's no-BS breakdown and final rating:

**Storytelling:** A mixed bag. What I mean by this is that I've seen every *thriller* available at the local theatre these last 6 months, and this was - by far - a much more fleshed out story compared to some of the more recent offerings (ex: *Countdown*, *Black Christmas, The Grudge*). However, it suffers from a lack of character development, as well as convincing creature science. 

The show thrusts you right into the problem from the opening scene, and does a decent job at keeping things moving throughout. I do want to be clear in stating that there's no new ground broken here - many that see this one will immediately draw connections to other stories like *Alien, 10,000 leagues under the sea, The Abyss, leviathon, The cave...etc* \- you get the point, people do things that result in them being isolated in a difficult-to-navigate environment, and the only way out is through the problem so that they can *maybe* escape if everything goes right. This is a tried-and-true story we've seen and read (although I can't read) 1000 times before - however, its tried-and-true for a reason. In my opinion, monster stories that isolate characters and place them in unavoidable conflict are the absolute best type of sci-fi thriller/horror (Ex: *Jaws*, *The Thing*, *Alien*, *Jurassic Park*...etc), and this is trying to be a new entry into that club of films. It does not succeed however, and lands somewhere short of being memorable, but certainly re-watchable.

Speaking of characters, this is the weakest point of the story. This lad is a firm believer in that if you're going to have a movie centered around sci-fi monsters, at least include plenty of extras to be fodder in various gruesome ways. This wasn't a problem at first, as there was plenty going on, and people were dropping like flies for various reasons, but somewhere about halfway through - you start to see who has plot armor and who doesn't - and this quickly breaks the immersion as you realize some characters are immune to the grisly deaths that others quickly experienced.

As touched on above, none of the characters are fully developed or necessarily memorable. There's the funny guy from *deadpool* (T.J. Miller) playing a funny guy that says funny things, and then there's a woman that's a mechanical engineer and can open/hack any digital device around (Kristen Stewart), and then there's the captain (Vincent Cassel) - the only person that's actively trying to keep everyone alive - and then there's everyone else. I word it this way, because that's the extent of the development that takes place. There's some sidebar about Kristen Stewart having lost her fiancé at some point in the past, the captain is also revealed to have suffered a loss of his daughter that is never really elaborated on, and then two of the other miscellaneous characters like each other, and T.J. Miller has a favorite plushie that he brings with him because that's his *quirk*. I'll spoil that the plushie is one of the only things that survives - and many people put in a lot of effort to make sure it does.

I also want to briefly mention that the biology of the main threat is something I can't help but question. I've been told by wizards wise beyond their years - that any creature that's evolved within the aphotic zone - more than 7 miles down - will likely not rely on something like *eyesight* in order to catch its prey. instead, a creature would have much more powerful sensory abilities (i.e. the ability to detect heat signatures and sonar capability) versus needing light in order to hunt. Now, this aspect is never fully explored, and the director can certainly have the monster be and do whatever he wants, but there were *tense* scenes where characters - whom are standing on the ocean floor of the Mariana Trench (don't even get me started on the pressure/physics questions) - were scrambling to turn off their lights as monsters were searching for them, and it seemed to effectively keep them hidden and safe for some reason.

**Direction:** William Eubank (*The Signal*) put out a decent attempt with the direction of the film. The camera work and editing (albeit predictable) are effective, and the *cool* color palette containing deep shades of blues and blacks is perfect for the setting of the story. The thing that really separates *good* from *great* in this genre is that most people are more afraid by what they don't see versus what they do see. Many stories of this nature have been ruined by giving the main threat too much visibility on screen, as things tend to be less scary when the monster is fully in view. This film wasn't *ruined* per se, but I think most would agree that less is more within this type of genre, and this movie in particular would have benefited from keeping us in the dark more than it did; something that would have been easy enough to do. The scope of the threat becomes crystal clear eventually, and while it does reach a Cthulhu level of hopelessness during the final act - it wasn't necessary to show as much as Eubank opted to, and it would have likely been more interesting and eerie had the threat remained in the shadows, but ever-present

**Pacing:** No complaints. The movie kicks off with a bang (literally), and things pretty much don't stop from there. Some of the characters could have been more developed, but that horse has been kicked to death above.

**Acting:** The Acting was pretty good. There were some silly exchanges at various points throughout ""Ex: I like anime too!"", but the actors and actresses all did fine. This was never an issue for me.

**Sound:** The sound was good. There were some *gimmicky* loud moments to draw out jump scares at times, but I do remember thinking about halfway through that the overall score was surprisingly above par for this type of film. It almost had a *spacey* retro synth vibe to it at times, but then a slow ethereal feel at others. Definitely worth a listen if you enjoy atmospheric soundtrack music.

\--

**Final Verdict:** 6.5/10

Realistically this was an enjoyable film that isn't far from being a *great* film. The cast showed up, and they did the best with the material they were given, but had there been some changes to the lack of character development, some of the creature effects/ambiguity, and a little less plot predictability - this very easily could have been a B+/A- film. I do think it's worth noting that Fox has been sitting on this completed project for two years, and that in a lot of ways it felt like Disney acquired this movie and simply didn't know what to do with it - so they decided ""let's just throw it out in January and get rid of it"". It's a suprisingly high-production release for this time of year. There are also some genuinely grisly/terrifying moments in this movie - ironically none i'm referring to involve the monsters - but the opening sequence especially will be enough to make many people pass on ever staying in an underwater facility. 

If you thoroughly enjoy *Deep Blue Sea* and *Anacanda* \- this will likely be fun for you. If you're looking for the next *Abyss or Alien* though - this is not quite on that level of craftsmanship.

ff2ae2o,"Pretty good. Everything good about it has been said here. I thought it was fast paced, characters weren’t horror movie cliche stupid, the characters were good to passable, TJ Miller was funny, the jump scares were good, the creatures were interesting, the big Cthulhu esque monster was a cool surprise, and Kristen Stewart’s character actually sacrificing herself was a good way to change it up from the main final girl survives. 

A few things I didn’t like about it though. There’s no explanation for the creatures. That small pink creature that was brought in from the dead person’s back (that whole sequence reminded me of Alien) disappeared from the movie. It would have been nice to see the main monsters clearer at least once. Black guy dies first trope. TJ Miller could have lasted longer since no one else was funny. Stewart’s character had too much plot armor until she had anti plot armor since the escape pod was conveniently FUBAR. The explosion was a bit too easy as well. 

The good definitely outweighs the bad for me though, and what I didn’t like here were mostly nitpicks. This movie gave me a lot of Gears of War vibes.",emii5v

fdqm52q,"If this is your type of movie (and it is mine), you'll like it just fine. If you skoff at it, or still get on Steward for Twilight and refuse to see her as anything but boring Bella, you won't.I give it a solid B, maybe B-. It's a good enough creature feature. Very streamlined- putting any exposition in the opening credits kept from a bunch of ""as you knows"" of characters giving eachother info they know - and allowed to just straight up cut the first act of the movie. We're here for action-horror-survival and we just jump right on in.I was reminded on a story-thrill ride. From one disaster pushing us into the next. The characters are pure stereotype - the headstrong lead, the captain with a tragic past, the comic relief, the useless IT guy/back-up comic relief, the scared new person, and the cannon fodder. Plus, giant Cthulhu monster and a ton of little ones. Liked their design but sad they are CG. My big negative is the murkiness. It's expected for the bottom of the ocean but there were a lot of outside shots I wasn't sure what I was looking at. Curious to why the abandoned platform was still stocked like everyone just left. The Captain said its not there anymore but it was fine, just quickly abandoned. Expected something to come from that - like they found the monsters once before. When she looked at his ID card I thought she was about to plug it in and find out more details over what's happening. I wonder if that was originally there but cut in the ""eh, no one wants exposition in this movie"" end of things. The voiceovers on either end was weird but eh.

\--ps   keep seeing ""Alien underwater!"" but that's not really true. There is a ton of Alien in the DNA - the production design mainly - but it's way more Descent. I think its one of those that wears it's influences on its sleeve and people take that for ripping off rather than the filmmakers acknowledging the similarities.

Saw the early reviews that painted Stewart as channeling her inner-Ripley and they were spot on but in a good way.  Strong, believable character.  Only thing I would've wanted could have been one more death, maybe with a little more gore.  The ones we got were probably realistic given the situation, but the 3 we saw were rather quick (although the first one was crazy) and more or less PG-13-ish (other than that first one).

Creatures were kinda generic, but the big baddie was sweet with some Lovecraftian vibes.  Cassel and Henwick were great too.  Miller is what he is...but at least he turned it down a notch or two and was tolerable outside of 2 or 3 moments",emii5v

flt8y41,"The worst part of this movie for me was that there was no introduction to the underwater station. I wanted to see life on the station before the disaster to introduce the characters and their relationships to one another as well as, the world around them.

Instead, the movie skips the character introduction, gives us this half baked opening sequence with news paper articles and starts directly at the inciting incident. 

It was jarring and the latter half of the movie feels overtly long because they have to make the action sequences even longer because their was no introduction.  

This movie copies a lot from Aliens and i dont really mind that. Because Aliens is awsome.

I've studied the Trieste and Marianas Trench, and the pressure there defies most people's understanding; its 8 TONS per square INCH. That's like have 100s of large trucks piled on your body crushing you, the pressure is insane.

The Trieste was a bathyscape (mini-sub) that was the first vehicle to reach the trench and its steel walls were over FIVE inches thick, there is no way they could have been walking around 7 miles down in those suits. 2nd issue is that the nanosecond the building/station wall was compromised, the destruction of the station would be instantaneous, like microseconds. No running around with bulkheads falling, etc.  

The movie was fun and entertaining, but unless they were using force fields in Picard's 25th century, they would have been better off being say, 2,000 feet down instead of 7 miles, which was ludicrous.

The other major issue was they could have skipped the monster part altogether, as Sunshine 2007 should have. The situation was already incredibly dangerous - esp if they were somehow miles down - so throwing in monsters, who also could not possibly have lived in such pressure, was ridiculous. There is science fiction, but there is still the laws of physics, and this was closer to middle earth than to sci-fi.",emii5v

Going from scene to scene not knowing anything about the characters and then having to decipher who is getting killed and who is yelling is tedious indeed.

A lot of you give the movie credit for starting the action at minute 2 and never letting its foot off the pedal, just why? There are no stakes for me because I don't care about the people that are in danger. Creatures were boring af as well, instead of making some cool shit they opt for the mermaid look for whatever reason.

This movie started like a race car and I liked it.

Story was pretty predictable, I actually told my gf after 5 min they will try to get to another station on foot without watching any trailer, and I even called out most deaths but I guess after watching a lot of horror movies it gets harder to trick me.

Of course there were scenes that made no sense at all (let's blow up this whole station in 2 seconds without any security check, the scan of hostile and friendly objects at an oil rig,...) but I can live with those flaws.

I liked that Nora and the intern were the last two standing, and weren’t damsels in distress.

The reveal of Cuthulu at the end was fucking awesome. As mentioned it did riff off Cloverfield, with the creatures living off it and giant underwater creatures.

I had heard the movie was like Alien but underwater and had ties to Cloverfield with some lovecraftian elements in it. Maybe these expectations got me too hyped and after having watched it I'm left feeling disappointed. 

&#x200B;

* First of all, what I liked about the movie were the monster designs, the claustrophobic omnipresent tension, the cinematography and the sound design. 
* Why didn't they connect Underwater with Cloverfield? It would've been so easy to do that. Lovecraftian? They'll get points in monster design but lovecraftian for me is so much more. It's atmosphere and madness and a cosmic sense of dread. The movie **is** similar to Alien though but weaker on all points.
* I really wish they would've fleshed out the characters. The three people that died in the beginning, who were they? Make me care that they died! In fact, there was no character progression whatsoever. Every personality ended exactly the same way they started.
* Did we ever get an explanation for Norah tapping on her chest? Was it to calm her down? Who taught her that?
* Being Lovecraft-themed I thought either Norah or Emily would slowly descend into madness after witnessing so many deaths. The movie made it seem like it made an impact on them but it never lead to anything.
* The stuffed bunny didn't lead to anything either. Take it out of the movie and it wouldn't had made a difference.
* I laughed way too hard at the computer in the end that showed the baddies in red chasing after the good guy pods in green. Did it scan all the way up to the surface? What did it scan to show only the baddies and the pods? Why did it color them? Who programmed it to do so?

What I liked: I really liked the design of the structures, the suits, and the monsters. I liked most of the performers, and I thought TJ Miller was really funny. The presence of jokes didn't bother me, they didn't take away from the suspense for me.  The ending is really satisfying. You could sell this movie to me on the line ""Kristen Stewart does her best Ripley and blows up a giant Cthulu monster."" Some of the deaths are pretty brutal. Rodrigo getting souped was a nice touch and Nora getting enveloped then shooting a flare through the thing was dope.

What I didn't like: I wish we had gotten 1 or 2 scenes of things going right at the beginning before shit went down. Also there were more than a few times where I couldn't make out anything. That may have been my theater but I suspect it's an issue with the film, at least to some degree. The movie wastes John Gallagher Jr completely and I don't think Jessica Henwick is particularly good in this, though that might be the character more than her performance.

And of course they are always out of lifepods when it's convenient for the ""plot"".  It wasn't bad but it was just one long scene of the twilight girl running.

The numerous overt and poorly done references to alien made me hate it that much more.

fdtpvzo,"I was sad this movie got negative reviews, was hoping it would be good.  But I went to watch it because of y'all people posting such positive comments.  People downvoting me because they disagree with my review smh

What a disappointment this movie is!  There is not much here I like!  From the RT score I didn't expect a good movie, but I thought it at least would be fun.  Such a dull story and characters.  All around the most disappointing movie I've seen for a good year at least, and I watch a fair number of movies.  I should have trusted the RT score.

Stewart looks good in this movie though I will say that.

Why I don't like Underwater.

-The movie opens and closes with cliche newspaper montages to beat you on the head with the plot info they apparently couldn't figure out how to implement more elegantly.  It gives a minute of some lady talking about losing sense of time underwater, then goes right into ""we have to flee the station, it's imploding"" -- ok.  maybe this would have worked if the movie would fill us in on the details and characters as it goes on.

-But it doesn't.  IDK who any of the characters are, so I don't really care about any of the people she finds while fleeing the exploding ship.  And they don't get much development as the story goes on, either.  Most of them die, some quite soon.  And for the ones who do get some development, I didn't CARE about it.  The captain stays because his daughter actually died when she was 14, ok, but he was still kind of a nothing-character, so that revelation feels empty.  TJ Miller was annoying and I wish he had died first.  The nervous corgi woman and Nora are the only characters I ever felt a shred of anything for.

-Plotwise, there are like one or two lines about how this station apparently drills, and they drilled too far.  OK...so I guess the story is really just as simple as ""get out of here and avoid the monsters""

-Which would be fine if that were executed in a fun way.  Sadly it isn't.  The monsters are wholly uninteresting IMO.  Their designs are typical fare.  Just blah.  All you need to know about them is they swim around and attack you and eat you; there's no intrigue about them, and there's nothing scarier about them than there is about any other vicious carnivorous animal.  Other creature movies have made much more interesting creatures that do more conceptually than ""scary-looking predator.""

Also I thought it was weird how the first time the monsters pull a character away, into that tunnel, and the others follow him into the tunnel to pull him back out, they don't even acknowledge the presence of the monsters any more (even though they are clearly STILL RIGHT NEXT TO YOU and are a present danger), they don't even say ""what are we gonna do to avoid these things?"" they just act like they've forgotten them; luckily the monsters let them pull him out again).  ...BTW, I thought it was pretty fun seeing Nora slice her way out of the monster who swallows her!

-The giant one had potential to make them a bit more interesting, but it wasn't meant to be.  Because all it does is float there and look frightening until it gets exploded.  It's basically just a halloween prop that says BOO at you.  It's literally just this: https://i.redd.it/iz9yva0oisi31.jpg

-The cinematography is annoying.  When action is happening, it's not easy to tell what's going on.  The editing just has us jumping between close shots of characters to the point where I can't tell where anyone is or even whom I'm looking at.  And there's just a ton of screaming people (who are quite hard to understand).  Underwater scenes are so hard to parse spatially.  ""It's in dark waters, it *should* be hard to parse.  The extreme close shots are there to make you feel claustrophobic"" you might say.  But no.  It's beyond claustrophobia, it's to the point of frustration at how hard it is to tell what the environment is like.

Lame action.  Lame characters.  Lame monsters.  What is this movie's draw meant to be?  I give Underwater 2/7",emii5v

fduf2lo,"I work in the environmental field, sometimes on drill rigs. I got a kick out of all the ""safety first"" and ""use the buddy system"" posters there were, because you 100% see those all over job sites. That being said, *if* they were to actually build an underwater drill platform it would have so many safety redundencies that the movie would have been over in 5 minutes. The first sign of **any** station integrity loss would have called a ""stop-work"" and everything would have been postponed till it was 100%. 

ALL THAT BEING SAID: 
Good movie. Not great, but good. I appreciated set and prop design a lot. Those suits looked bad ass (except you don't put lights INSIDE the visor or you can see shit - but I get it, we gotta see the actors). Really cool visuals. Good score, but also not phenomenal. It didn't have any particular tune stick with me longer than it's scene. Ending line was way cheesy, but oh well I guess.

fdpp9bf,"Just gonna copy my post from the other thread. 🤫

I liked it a lot, the suspense was well done and the characters were so damn likable. It’s been a while since I felt sad that a horror movie character I expected to die died and it happened at least three times here. I thought it was great that they didn’t waste any time on exposition of why they were down there or some secret evil plot by the corporation; just threw us right in the middle of the action. It gave me massive soma vibes as well, even including a similar plot point related to travel. 

My only two gripes were the ending and the captain’s death. It really feels like they weren’t sure what to do at the end so they just tossed in the standard live for love crap and some weird narration that they really could’ve done without. It bothers me that they managed to have at least three really great scenes of Stewart silently emoting and decided that the last scene needed to be spelled out for us. As for the captain’s death, I don’t know a lot about drill suits but do they normally contain self destruct buttons? Scratch that someone on the last thread pointed out he decompression exploded after he detached his glove. 

Lastly does anyone have some thoughts on Paul and Lil Paul? Do you think anxiety or something?",emii5v

Having tj Miller constantly crack jokes while trying to be serious just didn’t work for me. It got annoying quick. 

I did enjoy the suspense though, especially those last 30 minutes. Thought the acting performances were fine, the visual effects/cinematography/etc was fine, the story and writing was fine.

isi6cc3,"Just watched this movie.

I liked it a lot, I love movies like this.

Kirsten Stewart sucks though and makes this hard to watch at times. Her acting/character/whatever is super annoying. For some reason the director decided to focus on her a lot for these long drawn out shots where nothing is happening except her staring blankly at the ground.

So many fade to blacks, only to skip all the cool things. Also, the editing on this film was all over the place. So many plot points hinted at, only to be skipped by the story. I felt lost and teased the whole film. 

Kristen Stewart is always great but there was not much to work with here. Hoping she gets some good scripts again soon. I’m honestly shocked at how disjointed this film was. I really respected going for the main action right out of the gate...but felt underwhelmed by the plot developments thereafter.

flmg390,"One thing I don't like about some movies is the casting of comedy relief. When I saw TJ Miller's name in the cast, I already knew what his role was gonna be and was relieved when his character died and we wouldn't have to deal with him anymore from that point forward.

I was kinda surprised at the short runtime. Considering where the movie started, I thought things would occur in fairly real time but as the movie went on, that obviously wasn't gonna happen. I had some problems with this movie from the very beginning. She didn't rinse her mouth after brushing her teeth, is one. Maybe it was implied when she wiped her mouth afterwards? We'll never know. Two, she was walking around in a locker room barefoot. Having shared locker rooms in my life, that's a no-no. That's how you get ringworm, athlete's foot, etc. But...I continued watching.

Why'd she have to go door to door to wake people up in that situation? As if they wouldn't have been jolted awake already. I mean, c'mon. But...I continued watching...Lol.

The black guy usually dies first so they got that part stereotypically right. The person that always says ""I can't do this"" usually survives. So...you know. Later, they reveal the theme of the movie when that same character says ""We're not supposed to be down here."" Anti-offshore/underwater drilling propoganda? Then Norah goes Ellen Ripley. Even the baby creature looked like a chestburster. Tian Industries sure sounds a lot like Weyland-Yutani. Were they really drilling for resources or were they trying to find those creatures? And then there was the sequelbait at the end. With a proper script, yeah, it could work. They laid a decent foundation for possible continuation.

If they drilled into the equivalent of another ecosystem, shouldn't the creatures not have been so quick to adapt? Why were they humanoid? How'd they have pigment? What was their original food source? Big momma and her kids sure seemed to have some pretty strong skeletal structures that far down. The further up they went after the pods, the water would get colder, wouldn't it? Pressure not as much either. You get where I'm going with this. The science doesn't add up.

There was a lot wrong with this movie but at the same time, I watched the whole thing. I wasn't expecting much and didn't get it. That was largely due to Kristen Stewart being the lead. I've never seen her in anything that blew me away. Five out of ten stars from me.",emii5v
fdtzocv,"Honestly thought it was boring and awful. The only joy I got out of it was being reminded of other things while watching it. The suits looked cool and reminded me of Gears of War and Lost Planet. Got strong Alien and The Thing vibes in the beginning. 

The problem is every single character is bland af and the only drama comes from the vague threat of the creatures. The crew seldom disagrees with each other or have any interaction beyond ""Are you okay???"" All the characters shared the same relationship with each other. Watching the movie felt like when your friend who has never written a movie tells you the plot for his sci-fi underwater thriller and there never seems to be a point to the story he's telling you. 

The movie just throws us into the action with no setup, no idea of what the our setting is beyond underwater facility or how it operates and therefore we never know what the stakes are but it's okay here's a jump scare and some seizure inducing flashes. I was just bored senseless the entire time.",emii5v

In parts the film reminded me off

* Pitch black - the walk across the ocean floor
* Cloverfield - little monsters piggy backing on big monster
* Aliens - *Stewart* taps in to her inner *Weaver*
* Deep Blue Sea - break out from a collapsing underwater facility, while monster/mutated shark waits outside

fduvz4c,"I have a couple theories about this movie-

>!It's mostly a story about a young woman who feels trapped at a point in her life. She hasn't gotten over her ex and she has feelings for her boss. Her Ex's new girlfriend starts to work with them, and it's devastating to her to see him happy with someone. I like how she comes to respect the new girlfriend and she needs to let them go a find their own happiness. Every guy on the ship is willing to die for her and she has to work through letting go of emotionally unavailable men. I think the end, it's an apocalyptic metaphor for ""letting go""!<

It tries to have a very Alien vibe. It has character actors and retro tech hallways and a cool synth score. Stewart is actually fantastic, playing a character who is buff and determined but fragile and lonely. Her raw physicality is magnetic.

However, the whole thing reeks of having been interfered with by producers. There's clearly a version of this where there was more story and character beats, I suppose may have gotten axed partly due to Miller; but instead they went with more isolated underwater travel monologues, which are cool too. It's just a bit much on the underwater treks in cool suits.

Ultimately this movie should have leaned into being Gravity meets Call of Cthuhlu, but then the studio was like, oh hay, so we've been watching The Abyss and we have some ideas.

Visually it's a very nice movie. Makes the most of it's budget, some good practical effects. It's basically a disaster movie. It's a big-budget Lovecraftian action horror chick flick, and that's something we frankly need more of. 

Better than average but not quite as good as it could have been thanks to low interaction with any actual monsters and the exhausting TJ Miller.",emii5v

Deep-sea divers have to ascend slowly in order to avoid [the bends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness), which can cause permanent brain damage or death (or any number of other horrible injuries). Maybe the escape pods were designed to ascend slowly & safely.

But then, it's physically impossible for the human body to withstand pressures above a few hundred meters deep, and they were 7 miles down.

Paul is the audience. He's meta, he closes the door, he cares about Smith's kid, and mostly he doesn't treat the situation as seriously as the other characters even though its life or death. 

Hes a pressure release for the audience, so the movie doesn't blow it's INTENSITY load, a la the marvel films, guy ritchie movies, etc. The tone of the scenes Paul are in, are demonstrably different in that they never let the pedal get to the metal so as to let later scenes be that much more impactful.

His jokes and idiocy are used to distract the other characters from the task at hand, and to help them just keep going. He's not just a comedic foil, he's also keeping the crew grounded without asking if they have a dog. 

Losing Paul as an act 1 closer, is used to show that there are no more distractions, you're going to live or die. Just because you're likeable or self-aware doesn't mean shit if you're dead, so KEEP MOVING OH MY GOD.

Vincent didn’t warn them about monsters despite glaring into the camera as if he knew they were there. TJ Miller stood around and talked to the bunny for long enough that he got snuck up on.

- It was not an earthquake, it was an attack by the deep ones and Cthulu himself. 

- in lucian's locker you'll see not just the location of the drill that freed Cthulu, but two drawings. One is of a deep one and the other is an official drawing by Lovecraft of cthulu himself. 

- Lucian said the Sheperd was gone because that locker ties him to the Cult of Cthulu and directly implicates him to what's happening

- he did not know roebuck was infested but knew what it was digging and why

So, to break it down.

The ending credits show the company will resume the dig. We also know Lucian lost his friend and his daughter. The company he was employed by is a cult of cthulu and they were intentionally digging to find him and set him free. Lucian was most likely working with them because he was told that through the God he could have his daughter and friend back. An effect of Cthulu and awareness of him is insanity. People would often draw him from dreams. Which explains the drawings he had in his locker along with the map.

The pentagrams in the locker also imply ritual intentions. So he was most likely looking into a means to revive his lost daughter. He abandoned not just the Shepard but the memorial photo he had of his daughter. Which implies the Shepard, which was the first drill site, was inhabited solely by the cult of cthulu. Which is why the Roebuck is empty, as the majority of worshippers either willingly let themselves be taken or simply escaped on sight.

Either way, they're goal from the start was to free the God of madness and Lucian was very much aware.

There are a myriad of narrative problems.  The actors themselves get confused as to what station they are at several times in the film...and they just left it in.  Or the scenes were edited, and nobody thought they had to go back and ADR some lines.

Bizarre.

About half-way through the film, the asian lady is absolutely killed, but she turns up to get killed later.

It feels like someone in the editing bay had no oversight and wasn't watching the film.

I was also pumped for the Cthulhu reveal, which I believed was going to more of a passing bit of imagery...but there is an entire CGI face tentacle man attacking the station.

Not exactly a complex scenario, I personally much preferred their approach of diving (heh) straight into it vs. 20 minutes of bland exposition and character intros like every other monster movie, or hell, most movies in general.

Instead it just relies on a cheesy cliche newspaper-clippings-montage in the opening credits to establish the general plot, and expects you to just know what's happening next, which you can, since it's a very safe, predictable, and uninteresting story

The film decides to forgo the bulk of the first act and jump straight into the inciting incident. The viewer does lose a lot of those interpersonal relationship building sequences that you would typically see in a first act. 

And personally I'm fine with it. The characters were broad enough to allow the viewer to fill in the blanks. And the actors did a great job emoting to one another during the slower moments of the film to build a base of each relationship. 

Paul and Smith's little pump-up dance in the airlock. Lucien treating to Norah's injury after the initial flooding of Kepler. Emily's dog talk to stave off her fears. Paul and lil Paul. Norah's conversation with Emily. All were great character building moments that got their intent across and allowed for the viewer to fill in the blanks of each characters relationship with one another.

 The only one that was really outta left field was the romance between Emily and Smith. The movie was calling it some true love but the two characters hardly shared a line with one another. Sure there was a Moon Pie and she said that she loved him, but that was about it.

The first thing Kristen Stewart does after sealing the crew compartment is run to a comms station to check the stations hull

They bring guns with them. 

Yes the thing jumps at TJ  miller, but they shoot it instead of dying to it ( a la facehugger)

Before the black guy dies they try and keep the door from opening. It's also hinted at by Kristen Stewart that he gave himself the faulty helmet (it looks like part of this scene was cut. Hes actually the one that hands her a helmet in the prep room)

When they pull up TJ Miller on the other side of the debris he isn't torn in half or missing etc. (that's the trope). 

When the creature starts to pull TJ miller backwards (almost a full minute after the fakeout) the first thing they do is put his helmet back on him to stop him from drowning.

They set up the stuff with the intern girl earlier. It's shown that she talks to herself when she's nervous. She isn't having a breakdown. She just talks to herself when she's nervous. She was rightfully freaked out because she thought Kristen Stewart was dead AND she was low on oxygen.

Kristen Stewart has the other girl go ahead of her and take the passed out guy (it was the smart move instead of them both trying to run for it)",emii5v
fds2v97,"> TJ Miller reaches out and grabbed the monster.

Reaches out to investigate an anomaly in a dead body. Didn’t know it was a monster or that there even were monsters, just that a piece of that guy’s body was moving so he investigated.

> The girl who couldn’t do anything for herself just stood in the middle of the ocean crying.

She actually drug the guy who was out of oxygen and had a broken leg probably about half a mile across the ocean floor by herself with the knowledge that there were unimaginable creatures in the darkness around her. She also wasn’t crying, she was talking to herself (or talking to the unconscious guy) as she walked, she only started freaking out when Nora was behind her and she thought it was a creature. But okay.

> The black guy who dies first (trope) just stood there and let it happen.

Technically those two people in the hallway died first.

And do tell what exactly *you* would do with a faulty cracking helmet at the bottom of the ocean as a pressure door is opened. Nora shouted to close the door, but they had already overrode the system because the exterior door was faulty. How would you prevent your implosion in that split second? I’ll wait.

His sacrifice was actually very noble. They needed six helmets. There was only five that were structurally sound and one that was a risk with a crack. He took the risky helmet for himself.

> Vincent didn’t warn them about monsters despite glaring into the camera as if he knew they were there.

Where are you getting that information? Also, *if* he did know the monsters were there, there’s nothing he could do about it. Telling them about it would only cause them to panic and they needed to be as level-headed as they could to survive. The captain swallows the burden of knowledge of the real danger while trying to get his crew out of there. They’re doing what he’s telling them, so he’s making the necessary decisions with his knowledge and the team just needs to execute from there. And that’s all *if* he knew, which I don’t know how you got that impression.

> TJ Miller stood around and talked to the bunny for long enough that he got snuck up on.

They were going through one at a time while tethered in case someone got stuck. That’s protocol. He was just talking to the bunny while he was waiting for the last guy to get through, then he was going. He got snuck up on because he was the last to go through, not cause he was standing around with his thumb up his ass for no reason. And when he noticed something behind him, he said fuck protocol and went through early. His line just got stuck.",emii5v

I wasn't taken out of the mood because of the octopus monster, it's just that with a mainstream narrative that only has 90 minutes to make it's point, I wouldn't expect the writers to mix scary as-yet undiscovered--but not outside of the realm of scientific possibility--terrestrial monsters along with cosmic cthulhu monsters. Sort of muddles the story direction in my opinion, as in, what am I (or the characters) supposed to be scared of? 99% of films (let alone survival and/or monster movies) will be somewhat singular in the message they're conveying, otherwise focus and coherence can be lost.",emii5v

fe8hw3m,"That is a really good point.  There was a sketch of Cthulhu in the Captain's locker.  But that doesn't mean that the monster was Cthulhu.  Maybe the Captain stumbled upon the fact that monsters are real, but got the specific monster wrong.  But that seems too complicated.  The film is enjoyable if you never read Lovecraft, and it little bit better,  if you see the influences coming, and are right.  A hidden truth, behind another truth seems like a secret joke only a few would get.

Let's say there's a thriller about the hunt for a Yeti.  The community is scared.  It is a witch hunt, and a thrilling movie.  Is it real, or is it not?  In the end, it turns out that the monster was real.  Yay, the community is safe.

However, some viewers realized that the metal parts in the woods were from the Millennium Falcon and the kid's drawing of the monster was of Chewbacca.  Then, we, the observant views realize that the ending is not what most people thought it was.  Not a community saving itself from an evil monster, but a fearful community lashing out at a helpless, time traveling alien.

If, at no point the monster harms anyone, then if the director or writer then reveals that it was not Chewbacca, but Snoova, another, nastier wookie, then that seems complicated.

The Emily character (Jessica Henwick) never dies and then comes back. I just watched the movie and that just isn’t a thing that happened. 

Neither do the characters get confused about the stations. Perhaps you got confused? 

Likewise I don’t see any sort of problem with the narrative, technically speaking. At least not to the point of it being considered a “mess.” 

I can see how some might have wanted to see less of the big monster. But we really didn’t get *that* much. Most of the shots tended to be revelatory/necessary. Like we need them to understand the hive aspect of the creature, and that it was going for the pods.

I do think there was some over-explaining in that scene with the drilling station AI announcing that “foreign objects are approaching the pods.” Like why is that a function that someone programmed in ahead of time. And I think the audience, at least the vast majority thereof, would have understood the dynamics of the scene without it.

- The Giant Crab: An enormous creature resembling a cross between a crab and a spider that kills Paul by slicing him with its leg.

- The Old Man: A large, humanoid, nearly skeletal creature that kills the Captain. I’m pretty sure the monsters in the movie are supposed to be this, albeit with some changes. The Old Man in the script was bioluminescent and had scraggly hairs covering its body. It was also apparently hunting Frilled Sharks which is neat.

- The Ghost: A creature that looks like a large floating mass of flesh with eyes that stalks Nora after getting separated from Emily. It reappears later having followed Nora and Emily into the Roebuck where Emily kills it before it can strangle Nora.

- The Behemoth: It was a colossal creature that Nora sees shortly before reuniting with Emily and Smith. They are able to see it at the same time which is how they end up finding each other. It was also said to have smaller creatures attached to it, so this was probably the early version of the Cthulu monster from the movie.

- The Shark: A bioluminescent shark as big as a bus that stalks Nora and Emily as they make the final sprint to the Roebuck.",emii5v

They absolutely show the Cthulhu monster A LOT.

You get way too much of this creature, and the climax of the film is a pretty clear shot of him crawling away and pee'ing his pants, because I guess it knew Kristen Stewart was about to detonate the station.  Somehow it knew that?

Looks bad, and you get LOTS of looks at it.

I guess that's my problem with the film.  I think the contained sequences are really good, but in the third act of the film, there are so many scenes that are disparate from this.  We need a long scene of a CGI monster man crawling around on the CGI station?  Just felt very out of place and cheap, when the camera was almost always with the characters.

If that's your only experience with Stewart then no shit you'd think she's terrible. 

With Pattinson there's less excuse to still have that impression of him, even before Twilight he became well known and was recognized as great in Goblet of Fire as Cedric, and now with the massive success of the Lighthouse most people have gotten the picture. 

Hope this film doesn't have as unsuccessful a financial future as the critical reviews paint, Stewart was pretty damn good in it and it was not bad on the whole.

I have mixed feelings on this lack of exposition. On one hand it was extremely refreshing to see a film like this not overexplain everything to death, and trust the audience to put the pieces together. But on the other hand it also wouldn't surprise me that they just cut 15 minutes of the film after poor test screenings. There clearly was a *lot* of stuff going on behind what we see.

He had a malformation in his brain that was undiagnosed until 2011, when it caused a series of serious seizures.

By 2012 (I can’t find the actual date) he underwent a surgery to remove the golf ball sized portion of his frontal lobe that was bleeding and malformed. According to him he asked the doctors if the procedure would affect him mentally, and was told it “shouldn’t” since that part of his brain wasn’t working anyway.

So the brain surgery happened before most of his success. Silicon Valley didn’t start filming until 2014, and his career really took off shortly thereafter.

So it’s possible his newly erratic behavior is the result of a new bleed or some other complication, but there hasn’t been any news about that. It’s also possible he’s just generally “off” due to being without a golf ball sized chunk of his frontal lobe, and if so that’s been the case for a long time (either since birth/childhood or from his surgery 8 years ago).",emii5v

feidx9z,">While conceiving the story's plot, W. Haden Blackman recalled some stories involving Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca, during the filming of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. The stories claimed that Mayhew was required to be accompanied by crewmembers who wore brightly-colored vests while in the Northern California forests where Forest Moon of Endor scenes were filmed, so as not to be mistaken for Bigfoot and shot. Working from there, Blackman crafted a story that involved Han Solo and Chewbacca landing on Earth in the Pacific Northwest, Han dying, and Chewbacca being mistaken for Bigfoot while roaming the forests in the proceeding years. Taking the long life spans of Wookiees into account, he decided to have Indy discover Han's remains over 100 years later.

https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/Bigfoot

In my imagination, some hypothetical script writer was hired to make it into a tv show episode.  The tv series never got made, and he took the script, removed the beginning, with a hole in time and space, clearly showing Han and Chewy, and anything else that clearly shows it is in the Star Wars universe.

He then makes it into a movie, with a happy ending, or sad ending, depending on how observant you are.  I felt like there was a case to be made that the recent film, ""Knives Out"", has a similar twist, where the hero at the end is secretly the villain, despite what the audiences understood.",emii5v
