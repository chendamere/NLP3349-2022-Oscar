g4x0iau,The best part was Max getting hyped as fuck over Cole losing his virginity.,ir4o2y
g4zm7af,The movie is basically Bee shipping her two favorite charges together and that's hilarious,ir4o2y
g4whxhb,The scene where Melanie kills her dad reminded me of Monty Python,ir4o2y
g57qccm,Max shirtless with his name tag on killed me,ir4o2y
g4xo9o8,I laughed pretty hard at the “not even mad” line.,ir4o2y
g51t8ep,"I didn’t love the >!turning Melanie bad completely out of nowhere twist!<,but I got used to it. Robbie Amell is the highlight. He knows what movie he is in and kills it. Also is it me or did >!Samara Weaving look a bit off?!<Not sure if it was a wig or if she has lost weight or what, but her face looked different which was especially obvious when they flashed back toward the end. Overall, I thought it was a decent sequel, obviously not as good as the out of nowhere first film.",ir4o2y
g4wfm83,"not as good as the first one. The kills were not as creative as the first (two decapitations and two exploding). the parents side plot was a bit meh. there are also some plot holes that I saw that are already mentioned by others. but I enjoyed it overall.

also I got distracted by the lead for the first few minutes of the movie a bit, he kinda looks like he could be Hailee Steinfelds twin.",ir4o2y
g5y4t5i,"Not as good as the first, but still a fun watch.

Max is probably one of the most fun villains in horror films in the last few years.  Absolutely love how he legitimately is proud of Cole and wants to make him into a stronger person, but is also a Psycho killer and constantly wants to also murder him.

Robbie Amell absolutely kills it haha.  Really, the cast is fantastic for these films.  Can't wait to see a third one, but I hope the writing is a bit stronger for it.",ir4o2y
g5m0op1,"My idea for The Babysitter 3:
It's been three years since the events of Killer Queen and Cole and Phoebe are still dating in college. Cole has somewhat gotten over his PTSD from the events of the first two movies and he has really fallen in love with Phoebe; so much so that he plans to propose to her at the end of the school year. In contrast, Pheobe is still kinda freaked out by the events of Killer Queen but she is seeming to get through it due to Cole's support. Everything seems relatively normal until Phoebe keeps on seeing Bee in random places(At the mall, the college hall, in her house etc). Cole tries to assure her by telling she disintegrated all those years ago and that they are safe. Then, poof! The cult (including Jimmy, Diego and Melanie) somehow return. Cole and Phoebe obviously get in defensive stances, worried that they will be sacrificed again. But surprisingly, the cult doesn't want to hurt them. In fact, Hell has changed them and they don't want anyone to go through the hell of being a cultist or a sacrifice. They inform Cole and Phoebe that the Book of Satan wasn't destroyed and it has somehow fallen into the wrong hands again.(Someone at the college has it)
A new cult has risen and Cole/Pheobe and the original cult have to stop them.

Continuing on the theme of hard work from Killer Queen, each cultist will realise that they didn't need a deal with the devil to achieve their dreams/wishes. John finds out he's funny, Max realizes he can just join the military to kill people(Would make for a good joke), Melanie and Cole make up etc. Unexpectedly, the cult and Cole/Phoebe start bonding.

Just like in Killer Queen,
Bee makes a cameo at the end. She legitimately became Phoebe's guardian angel because she was sent to purgatory, not hell and was cleaned of her sins.

What do you think?",ir4o2y

g55qq97,"Would definitely watch another one. This is the kind of shit that I expect from a cheap, crazy, B-Movie and I am not one bit disappointed. Netflix originals where they just let them run wild like this could be really cool. I think I'll look for more of those from now on.",ir4o2y
g4whnd7,I fucking knew they were hiding Samara Weaving from us!!,ir4o2y
g4wjz7r,Just finished watching it. The set up wasn't as interesting but it does pick up after they get to the lake. It's not as good as the first film but its a decent watch. I was surprised that all of the cast returned even the main lead.,ir4o2y
g4wp5e4,[deleted],ir4o2y
g4whjhh,"Just like the first movie I went in blind expecting garbage and was surprised that it was actually engaging. I felt the betrayal just as much as the main character. Most of the jokes didn’t land, but callback jokes actually got me giggling. This movie is over the top with its stylized “What The Fuck” moments, gore, and acting. A caricature of a slasher teen movie that isn’t exactly a spoof is what this movie is to me. 6/10 for the plot, 8/10 for a Sam Raimi-esk attempt.",ir4o2y
g4we7ep,"I actually really liked it. It's fucking nuts. The craziness of the first movie has been cranked up to the max. I kind of like when a movie goes balls to the wall.


Only complaint would really be Melanie turning evil because she wants to be... an influencer. Comes out of nowhere and then she tells Cole ""You know I've always wanted to be an influencer."" Okay, but the audience didn't. That and her friend group is very odd to me. Like Idk how that group came to be.


Honestly, I hope they make another. The shit's fun.",ir4o2y
g5xp8a7,"Not sure why the critics are being so hard on it. 

I enjoyed it as much as the first one. 

But King Bach and Robbie Amell are honestly so funny in these. And I’m not usually a fan of theirs. 
Max (Amell) -being hyped for Cole and just wanting to murder people is somewhat wholesome and Heart warming)

John (Bach) - I cracked up when he attempted to accept Jesus as his lord and savior while he was being burned alive for participating in the death blood cult lol",ir4o2y

I hope they do actually make a 3rd one.",ir4o2y
g4x0zdn,"There’s a sequel?! With the whole cast from the first film?! Hell yes. I absolutely loved the first one, and had no clue a sequel was even green lit.",ir4o2y
g50qi1n,"Really fun movie to watch on a Saturday night in a Netflix party. Sit back, have a couple drinks and laugh your ass off. Not every movie needs to have a deep, philosophical plot. 

Every single scene with Robbie Amell had me rolling

6/10 if you criticise it as simply a movie but I got 10/10 enjoyment from this.",ir4o2y
g5l107v,"i was super confused at the high school crew they had in this one, Cole, the neighbor chick, jock and two chubby latino's who i assumed were brother and sister until they killed her. Didn't make much sense until we found out they were in the cult too so thats what brought them together.  


Also i know this is a comedy but how was Cole not believed for what happened, two cops disappeared after going to his house in the first one, same with a parametic, the babysitter disappeared and I assume he gave the names of the original cult crew who had since disappeared. Just strange nobody believed him when like 7 people would now be missing.",ir4o2y
g4w8jdd,"It’s not as good as the first movie, but I didn’t find it terrible. It started off slow, in my opinion, but once everyone got to the house boat, the movie picked up and I enjoyed myself through to the end. Jenna Ortega and shirtless (again) Robbie Amell really steal the movie.",ir4o2y
g4yvclk,Jenna Ortega is going to get type cast as overly edgy teens.,ir4o2y
g5y6bjs," Tbf i can see why Melanie became a villain. Her mother was a deadbeat, her father was a neglectful douche who cared more about his car than his daughter. The events of the first film probably didn't help. She probably also has tramua.(well probably much lesser than Cole's tramua since he was the main target, but nevertheless Bee tried to kill her too)

I think her becoming an influencer wasn't just a meta joke or lazy writing. I think she wanted to have a billion fans because it could replace all the neglect and lack of love her father gave her. And it is clear that she would do anything to get that; even betraying her childhood best friend and becoming the leader of a Satanic cult.
She's kind of a tragic villain really.",ir4o2y
g67ydsq,"I enjoyed both films just fine.  After watching this one, I thought... ""well, how are they going to make it so he was just crazy this time?  His dad was there.""

...And then I realized his dad is also high.",ir4o2y
g8z9vs0,I've never made a comment on Reddit before but all I know is the downfall of Melanie pissed me off. she was cole's rock and his protector in the first movie but now she doesn't even flinch at the thought of murdering him to be a social media influencer?? it makes no sense and it feels like such a cop-out. they literally took the only other surviving member (besides cole) from the first movie and made her an ACTUAL psychopath....it's such lazy writing and that's saying a lot considering I really did enjoy the first movie. and on top of that there's supposedly supposed to be a third movie....are they gonna make phoebe the villian in the next movie??? I loved the first movie but in the end the second movie just got on my nerves to be honest,ir4o2y
g7m6mcd,"My only gripe and source of confusion is why would Melanie just agree with the devil's deal? If i remember the 1st movie well, she, little she, seemed to be generally kind and value Cole. Was that people change, Gen Z so starve for fame trope? Thats quite lame. I feel Melanie character was given injustice for shock value.


I enjoyed it regardless and seeing our fave babysitter Bee and a little backstory was worth it. Samara was the main reason I got interested in the 1st movie.",ir4o2y
g60p5t1,I appreciate the fact everyone involved realize its a dumb movie and nobody takes it seriously.,ir4o2y
g4wathi,"Still watching it right now. Got to the bambi scene. 

I gotta say this movie feels better if you start it right after finishing the first.

Oh god the Apache dance scene. Don't know why it made me laugh so much.

All the flashbacks scenes were great, especially for John and Max.

Subtitles ruined one of the twists by stating who was speaking during one flashback. 

The street fighter scene was great as well.

Overall I enjoyed the movie. Loved the whole ending and bringing back the school nurse.",ir4o2y
g6quf27,Third movie had better be Cole and Phoebe reaching Bee from Hell.,ir4o2y
g8xn9br,"iam not even mad respect 

that makes me laugh every time",ir4o2y
g6skcfn,Part3 will definitely be about saving Bee. I loved both movies,ir4o2y
g4wnxlv,"I had fun watching it. Adore the first one and this was a fun follow up. I was invested in the Bee/Cole relationship and the ending always bummed me out. I wanted to believe that she genuinely loved him. My friends and I would joke I'd probably end up dead if I was in the same scenario and decided to trust her. So I'm actually happy that brought Sam Weaving back to give her a redemption arc. I thought it was super sweet, and it makes me feel justified lol.",ir4o2y
g54c7pn,"It's totally different from the 1st movie and that's not a bad thing.

This movie feels more like Scot Pilgrim. it's good in it's own way. i think that's why some critics hate it because as a sequel it's not much but as it's own movie it's a pretty fun watch.

Also Max is the best.he may be a homicidal maniac, but he isn't an asshole like most of the cultist's",ir4o2y
g5atgmp,"Can someone explain how Coles dad manage to catch him up when he was stranded a 20 minute drive away? 😂

g4wc67k,"Ridiculously fun movie, loved the over the top kills.

Not everything has to be super suspenseful or serious.  Total callback to 80's camp horror.",ir4o2y
g635yhq,"I'll be frank, horror movies are horribly predictable to me. So that's why I love Horror-Comedies like ""The Dead Never Die"", ""Fright Night"", and the series ""Ash vs Evil Dead"". Now, ""The Dead Never Die"" is more along the lines of the newer age of Horror-Comedy where scenes get played with, tropes get roasted, and chaotic little absurdities just let you know the world isnt realistic, nor is it supposed to be taken seriously. Horror-Comedy is a genre that enjoys the die hard belovedness that comes from a cult classic B-movie status. So with these movies (especially McG joints) are you really expected to judge the movie on the grading scale of a AAA Oscar Nominee? 

Now, understanding McG is easy, he likes callbacks, references, and unconventional wordplay. Callbacks are easy things for the audience to remember themes and goals. When Cole's psychiatrist/school nurse tells him ""You gotta get laid"" and the solution to his whole problem is such. As well, I noticed he decided to imitate Edgar Wright with a packed soundtrack a la ""Baby Driver"". I'd consider it a sin if the music taste was incongruous, but it fit so I smirked and let it slide. 

Now for the Acting! Lead characters like Phoebe, Bee, and Cole were fantastic. Judah Lewis(Cole) played up his awkwardness just as well as someone who was a step away from being committed would, if not more. His quips and punch lines were delivered as though he felt the role and had fun with it, big points for that. While Bea's role (played by Samara Weaving) was mostly scenes fit for the meme, ""You son of a bitch, I'm in,"" her portrayal as an adult who had to make the hard choices and do horrible things for the people she loved, unknowingly bringing her two favorite people together. And Phoebe (Jenny Ortega), just as weird as Cole, but a rougher around the edges attitude. Her ability to laugh off a situation, endearingly bust Cole's chops, and peel those layers down to the soft and vulnerable person beneath that is really why I can't complain about the acting. The chemistry between the romantic leads is cute and very strong. As an aside, Max (Robbie Amell) is a phenomenal side character who enjoys encouraging his prey so the hunt becomes more interesting. When he finds out the whole plot is foiled by Cole and Phoebe ""dirty dancing"" in the bunker, he respects the leap Cole took and congratulates him as he burns up. A surprisingly wholesome end to a villain.

It's really easy to forget the true nature of comedy, to amuse and challenge logical thought. So the phrase, ""Don't take it too seriously"" is kinda the point. It's made to tell a funny story and question the sanity of the stiff-upper-lipped critics and their confusion over it. Don't try to compare it to anything just kick back and laugh, it's good for you.",ir4o2y
g66zk1f,"I’m a little late to the party here but I thought it was...fine. I laughed at a good bit of the jokes, the gore was laughably fake but in a good way, and I thought it was well acted save for Bella Thorne. The dad sideplot was funny for a good bit but the continuous “the car is my baby” joke and the weird scene with the cop just did not land. Samara Weaving is always a delight and getting her back was a very pleasant surprise even with that terrible wig. Hope she can come back for the third and we can get an actual definitive answer on her backstory.

As for the negatives, it’s pretty clear they did not have a big budget. Like I said, the gore looks fake, which isn’t a bad thing, but you can make a low budget movie look high budget when you’re setting your movie in a suburb. Not so with a lake. I don’t live in Illinois, but I don’t think their climate is conducive to having a desert lake like that.

In my opinion the best scene from the first is when Cole and Melanie are hiding from Bee; there’s some genuine suspense there that you don’t often get in horror comedies. When Cole and Melanie kiss, you’re happy, you’re rooting for them to succeed. And then the second movie doesn’t go anywhere with it. Cole and Melanie are still just friends, which is fine, but a slow burn romance or any type of payoff from that first movie is ruined. I like Phoebe and approve of her and Cole being together, but the whole Melanie turning evil is such a massive betrayal and a huge shift from the original and it is barely even addressed. Was there any inkling she wanted to be an influencer? Her dad sucked, we knew that, but is that really enough to turn her evil? Her personality shifted way too much for it to be believable. The best part of the first is that even though Bee was a terrifying cult leader, the movie humanized her. You cared for her. You could still see that she actually cared somewhat for Cole. In this, it just sort of had Melanie kill Boom Boom and any type of human traits she had went away as she turned into some mustache twirling caricature. It just seems like the fact that there are totally different writers from the first one reared its ugly head too much and there was way too much retconning of the original.

It also looks like Cole hasn’t really grown as a character since the beginning of the first movie, he’s still terrified of needles, still getting bullied, still dressing like a dork, still has zero confidence, still is too scared to drive. It cheapens the ending of the original, ruins any sense of triumph.

It may seem like I hate it, but all in all all I want from a movie like this is to be entertained. I was. I don’t hate the dialogue as much as other people and for a film nerd like me all the references were fun, even if they were unrealistic for teenagers. But when were these movies ever going for realism?",ir4o2y
ga4jutl,"Ok, I just watched it and I'm so confused. If Bee really cared about Phoebe and Cole, why did she reunite and requit people to kill them? It was a huge risk, and for what? Why did she want the members dead? Why did she kill herself? How was anything she did protecting anyone(it didn't look like the cult members were trying to kill Cole again until she met them)? And lots of bystanders died in this movie, indirectly caused by Bee, so how did Cole ""change"" her?

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie, but why rewrite Bee and her backstory, in such a confusing way? Totally ruined the ending.",ir4o2y
gar7erg,"While the plot was.... weird, I think they still achieved what the original was all about. A group of teens are fucking psychotic, but they somehow still act like teens. And I gotta say it Andrew Bachelor was fucking hilarious in this movie and I’m glad we saw more of him.",ir4o2y
gikas9j,I'm confused. How did people not at least somewhat believe Cole? I get they didn't find anything at the house but two police officers answered a 911 call and got murdered in the first movie. Also the sacrifice from the first film also is dead. wouldn't people be able to put together that at least something strange happened at that house in the first movie when those cops and kid just straight up dissappear? I thought about this the whole movie while everyone was acting like Cole is crazy.,ir4o2y
gc3bq3v,"I enjoyed it but it wasn’t as good as the first. One thing I was thinking about was why Cole was still considered “innocent” after the events of the first film? He killed four people, even if it was in self defense it was still murder. He was called the “Channing Tatum of murder” for a reason in the second film...",ir4o2y
g5menqf,"finished it last night and so far it was a fun movie. Not a good movie.. But a fun movie. Bella Thorne's acting was all kinds of awful, and you could tell Rob Amell was having way too much fun. The film had too many cut away jokes though. 

>!The Babysitter coming back and actually setting everything up so the main guy can get laid.. Was a neat twist.. But the concept of his best friend now being apart of cult was kind of dumb. !<",ir4o2y
g5hrw5o,"I just finished both films back to back and I know the reviews didn't like it, but I had a lot of fun with these films. Campy, goofy, gory slasher films. Sure, they're not 10/10 cinema but it was absolutely worth the watch.",ir4o2y
g6luqvf,"I definitely loved the first one more but I also had fun watching this one tonight. I love the actress who plays Phoebe, saw her in You and was blown away by her talent and screen presence, so was happy to see her in a leading role in this. Bee’s wig and contacts were absolutely terrible. Things that were confusing include the plot reveal at the end and also why does Illinois look like Utah in this movie? They had canyons and lakes and cliffs and desert. Sound mixing was also mediocre, kept having to adjust my volume based off of the scene, and I didn’t particularly care for Phoebe & Melanie’s video game style fight scene, or the odd Disco scene. Also was confused about why they chose to depict medications for mental health almost in a negative light (in my opinion) when they help a lot of people. Maybe I’m misunderstanding the message with that. Overall some solid performances from the cast, great dialogue, and fun homages and tributes to horror & sci fi  thrown into the mix.",ir4o2y
g4we8j1,"I like it, but not as much as the first one. Not as polished, and little more rough around the edges (bad CGI, shot composition, set design).

More cartoony, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I don’t think it’s executed as well as it could be (that video game fight scene, Juan admonishing Melanie as she kills him, etc.)

Robbie Amell is great again as Max (“I’m not even mad, bro!”).

Some inconsistencies bothered me a bit.

So, am I to understand that Melanie was in the cult even during the events of the first film? She mentions something about being “called in from the bullpen” because the older cultists screwed up the “first time.” But wasn’t she the one that convinced Cole to stay up and spy on Bee and her friends in the first place? And couldn’t she have ratted him out when Bee came into her house with the shotgun searching for Cole?

Bee’s motive for selling her soul getting the retcon treatment — wanting to be strong and confident. Now she did it save Phoebe?",ir4o2y
hkkr1ng,"I don’t know why this has bothered me so much. So much I had to vent on Reddit.

Watched the first one, enjoyed it for what it was, even ignoring the holes, like no one hearing the gunshots, the screaming, or why he hid under the house instead of just leaving?

The second one just took large dumps on the originals story. 

1. It was clearly more than 2 years, had to be for multiple reasons. Why not just say it was 4 or 5? 

2. No one believes Cole? Even if Bee had super natural abilities to clean in a hurry, how do you explain away the cops, the sacrifice? 
Also, what’s the point of it? Cole would have had all kinds of mental trauma that could be used as a catalyst to say everyone thinks he’s crazy/disturbed/not cool.

3. Melanie. What the hell? Even if you wanted her to turn, why be so lazy with it. *Poof* now she’s evil, because followers. Could have given 100 reasons that would have made enough sense for her to murder her bestie. No indication she ever cared about being popular, I mean, she had a crush on the dorkiest kid at school. 
Or, they could have made it so they had drifted apart over the years and changed, not that she’s still his best friend, video calling him same as always. No mention of how they were supposedly in puppy love? Just didn’t happen and now she’s with a jock. That’s also fine, but at least explain that they tried being more than just friends and preferred being besties. Or maybe she became obsessed with what happened that night and got deep down the cult rabbit hole.
The bully, who appeared to have lost his friends and his bike because of Cole, seemed like a much better choice as a new big bad who was dead set on destroying him.

4. Lastly, Bee. I can cop a change in the back story. Replacing “strong and confident” with “I had to save someone I love who I put in hospital” it’s lazy, but I didn’t buy “strong and confident” from a leggy 6ft blonde woman anyway.
But the whole “you changed me that night” is instantly undone by the fact Bee clearly recruited his bestie after that night. Could have picked anyone, why Melanie if you give a shit about Cole? Also, if getting him laid was the plan, surely the easier path was with Melanie anyway? 

Anyway. Could have been so much more, there were lots of other plot holes, they didn’t stop me from enjoying the movie like the above, but was a bit of fun.",ir4o2y

The attempt to make pop culture reference every 2 minutes threw me off the movie, in the first one it was somewhat justified because of the relationship  between Bee and Cole but here everyone it felt a bit too much with everyone else doing it. I also felt like they were way too obvious, like straight up naming the movies instead of a small wink to the audience. Some joke attempts felt also a bit much but at the end of the day maybe it just didn't click for me.

I actually think I liked Killer Queen better than the first one as well, especially considering that the best character from the first one is absent for most of the runtime. 

I feel like the dialogue in Queen wasn’t as cringe inducing as some of the dialogue in the first movie. I think that most of the cult characters were super unlikable in the first one, but I felt they were a lot funnier in this one. I almost want to see a Robbie Amell led spinoff where he isn’t wearing a shirt for the entire runtime(for some reason). I also feel like Jenna Ortega is one breakout role away from being a huge star.

I really loved the first. Great story, great flip on expectations,  great kills, and I loved Cole and Bees characters and relationship. (Huge crush on Samara Weaving also helps)

The sequel for me was just ok. They tried to make it feel similar to the first but fell a bit short. Characters weren't as interesting except for robbie amelle. Coles character you expected to be badass cuz that's how the last developed him, but kind of falls back . Bee seems forced cuz she was the best part of the first, but mostly seems like an afterthought in this one that they wanted to go back to make everyone love her like at the beginning of the first.

I so wish the sequel could of lived up to the first,  but oh well life moves on.",ir4o2y

hikflwy,"i liked the 1st movie but this one had way too many plot holes and overall was just cringe. it literally felt like this entire movie was made up on the spot. storyline made no sense. every line the actors spoke was cringe. 
story makes no sense that no one would believe cole when like 6 high schoolers are dead and missing and two cops and the babysitter but ok. sure. 
they make melanie evil which is lazy. 

the whole backstory of the babysitter selling her soul to save the little girl from car accident but then she’s sending the demons after cole and the girl? that’s a huge risk? they could have died many times. just to turn it around and kill herself and the demons (hoping cole and the girl have time for sex???) 

even little things like melanies dad from the first movie was this womanizer loser and this one he’s a pot smoking hippie like what. nothing was consistent. 

i love slashers and campyness and a bit of cringe but there still needs to be a coherent storyline to make it work.
this was all over and contradicts the first one. disappointed!",ir4o2y
g518lnr,"I enjoyed the Babysitter! Saw the first one last year so I had to check out the sequel. I was glad to see Samara Weaving come back too! She's a bigger star now, but she was nice enough to come back for the sequel.

Idk why this movie even has a Rotten Tomatoes rating. It's not something to take seriously. Just a funny movie with a killer plot. Can't wait for the trilogy. 😂",ir4o2y
g525zla,"I didn’t even know this movie was a thing until I saw it pop up on Netflix. I enjoyed the first one more but I also enjoyed this one a lot. Max was easily my favorite part with how he missed Cole and was excited for him to lose his virginity. My two major gripes with the movie were Melanie and the Bee twist. I just don’t think Melanie was a good villain especially compared to Bee in the first one, and I wasn’t a fan of how Bee was suddenly good. I’m not saying it’s impossible for Bee to change like she did I just felt it was very sudden without any build up. Again overall I enjoyed the movie and would definitely watch a third if it somehow happens.",ir4o2y

g4x63ej,"The film had fun moments because of the cast, but overall failed in my eyes because the writing was so lacking.

The first film was made from a spec script sold by Brian Duffield and remained largely intact. For some reason, they chose not to bring him back and instead let McG write alongside two unknowns, and the whole thing kind of feels like a retread of the original’s voice that doesn’t wholly understand it. Like when you hear somebody repeating a joke they heard - but doesn’t have the skill to land it.

That said, it was funny at times and I was never bored.",ir4o2y

g57wptt,"I liked it but it wasn't as good as the first one. 

* I'm in the minority that didn't even consider the possibility of Melanie being evil so that came as a shock to me which I both like and dislike. I liked that the movie did something (for me) unexpected but she was such a sweet girl so it was a bit of a shame to make her evil, especially since the old crew returned so she wasn't even really needed. 

* It was a bit weird seeing Melanie so sexualized too since in the first one she was just a kid. I'm not saying it is a bad thing however, she's an adult now (at least the actor) it's just kinda odd. 

* How did Cole even know about the redhead's journalistic aspirations? 

* First act of the movie was pretty weak, it wasn't until they got to the lake that the movie really started.

* The whole blood cult/Bee thing was a bit convoluted and I'm not even sure I understood it all. Like what's up with the events of the first movie if Bee isn't evil? Was the entire first movie just some 5d chess to match Phoebe and Cole together? 

* Phoebe was a good addition. 

I'd be down for more of these even though I didn't love this one and I also am not sure how they'd continue the story.",ir4o2y

I hate that because that's not realistic at all. Let's be real, if you were hunted by a bunch of deranged cultists and barely survived the night;  you would be fucked up too. So im glad Cole dealt with trauma in this film.
And it's also somewhat realistic how no one would believe him because a Satanic cult hunting a child over blood sounds outrageous.",ir4o2y

I liked it and thought it was fun! I didn’t mind what happened with Melanie and I liked phoebes character and story (I didn’t love their fight scene but it felt very Scott pilgrim to me). I loved that we got to see Bee return (I really like Samara Weaving in the films I’ve seen her in)

I like that it explains her being so different in the first few scenes, but it was just so cringe. I was really hoping for a brand new storyline. This was just a rehash of the first one, complete with recycled jokes. By the time Bella Thorne got shot in the boob again, I was rolling my eyes. 

Speaking of Bella Thorne, I loved her! One of the highlights. Another one of which is Samara Weaving of course. Bumped my rating up a notch just for the ending. So they nailed that surprise. 

Overall, would make a good double feature with the first. But I felt this was a complete genre switch that didn’t feel like it made much sense.",ir4o2y

Also if Bee died when phoebe was a little girl and these kids are supposed to be highschoolers in 2020 that means she would have died in the 2000s. They also showed her recruiting the main cult members from the first movie, so I dont know if they showed them being recruited in the past from like the 70s or 80s or if it was just supposed to be a gag.",ir4o2y
g97e8ed,"I enjoyed the film though could've done without all the sappy stuff. The first 20 mins is fine but I am here to see the absolute ridiculous nature that this movie intentionally creates, I always got a kick out of the creative death scenes with silly effects. The scene in the cabin just went on forever and really dragged the film to a very slow and boring halt, though picked up again towards the end.

I don't mind the childhood friend being a psychopath because there is absolutely nothing I take seriously with this film and that is what I believe is intended, if not then I may have offended some writers. It is (like the first) a fun movie to just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy. It definitely hit that mark for the most part.",ir4o2y

g5142aq,"As someone who loved the original, was pretty dissapointed with this sequel. The humor was a lot more desperate to be current and the antagonists mostly redid the same shtick they did in the first movie.

My biggest grievance is the absolute assassination of Melanie's character, there really was no reason to make her a villain and it totally ruins the interactions in the first movie.

Also not a fan of a redemption for Bee, what made her fun was that she was a villain that actually cared about her victims, keep her like that. Would have loved to just see the sequel be her and her gang trying again and when they failed just being like ""See you in two more years Cole""

I will say though that it isn't a total loss. There were a lot of scenes that still got a good laugh out of me (Max's 'backstory' was perfection) and the kills were just as fun as last time. Would like to see a third entry with some tighter writing.

gfsd5pz,The movie was fun but made no sense for all of the reasons listed in this thread. One thing that bugged me is there was nothing that indicated Cole and Phoebe had sex. The amount of time is debatable but they're two smart people who watch lots of movies. They think having sex while being hunted is a good idea? Also their clothes were completely untouched in the next scene. Plus Phoebe must've smelled like urine the entire time so I still can't see it happening in the scene where it was implied. Just an add on but Emily Alyn Lind is not aging well. She already looks 30 here. By 30 she'll look 45 and so on. Jenny Ortega looks like she'll keep that face for the next 15 years.,ir4o2y

g4xhsms,"Everyone in here is complaining about the CGI or whatever, my only issue was the Joe Exotic reference. The first movie came out in 2017, so 2 years later would place us in 2019, before Tiger King blew up. Obviously the movie taking place in 2020 would raise a ton of plot issues what with a pandemic and all.

I'm sort of assuming that Cole's mom's line about Joe Exotic wasnt in the original movie and got added sometime between March of this year and now, but thatd be one insanely obscure reference for a middle class mother in Illinois to toss out about a then-obscure zookeeper in Oklahoma.",ir4o2y
g4zt904,I thought this was genuinely atrocious and I really enjoyed the first film. Not sure where to even start but I guess as an overarching point it was trying too hard to appeal to fans of the first film and forgot to write a coherent or even vaguely interesting script in the process.,ir4o2y
g4xnmlj,"Really wasn't bad at all. I laughed more than a few times. The girls playing Melanie and Phoebe were both much better than they had to be, especially Melanie. She was clearly channeling Samara Weaving from the first movie and having fun with it.

The supporting cast was generally amusing, and there were some pretty good lines that almost sailed right past. ""Plan B isn't just the pill I take on Saturday morning"" and ""Did you take pot? Was that the night you tried to stick it in my..."" both had me laughing out loud.

The soundtrack was also excellent. My only complaint was that Samara Weaving returning was spoiled in the trailer and some flashbacks, that could have been a bigger moment if it was a total surprise. 

They took it in a different direction than the first movie and made a pretty solid sequel that stands on it's own. I was looking for 90ish minutes of entertainment and I got it.",ir4o2y
g4y2pol,"Echo a lot of sentiments: 

- Fun as all fuck 
- Gory as all hell

I also just wanna say that I really can see Jenna Ortega (Phoebe) having a long lasting career. She does really well with every role she’s given and it looks like she’s slated for a few awesome things soon. 

Judah Lewis too (Cole) seems to really be nailing horror roles. If you haven’t, you gotta see him in Summer of 84 and I See You. Would be cool to see him team up again with Ortega in Scream 5.",ir4o2y

g5k1943,"Okay.  Here's my prediction for the third movie.

The new girl in Cole's life who is introduced in this movie will be with Cole in college together.  About 40 mins in she will turn out to be the next satanic cult leader.  I think they've set her up really well, about as well as they did for the babysitter in the first movie.  She was really good at being likable and cool and making you think maybe she'd redeem herself, that she couldn't actually be the evil cult leader she appeared to be.  Same with this new girl.  They did a good job with her, making it seem like she won't actually be a cult leader in the 3rd movie.  But no, she will, in fact, be the cult leader of the next movie.  Similar hijinks ensue, the same old cultists show back up and they all die in slightly new ways.  Cole gets away to live another die while his family continues to question his sanity.

That's as far as my prediction goes.

I hope that they break formula here, though, for the next movie, and make his mom the cult leader, or maybe shift perspectives to his dad, who's worst fears are realized about Cole as Cole himself is revealed as the cult leader (god that would be an awesome movie, his dad is one of the best parts of both of these movies - he'd be a great protagonist, and it would really be pretty crazy to have Cole turn evil like that - the most well built-up ""good character"" - and to have his dad kill him off).",ir4o2y

The first act was a little lacking, the whole ""high school sux"" thing is a bit tired, but Cole is likeable enough that I found it endearing in a way. I loved seeing the returning cast, and their backstories were gems. And also, not to sound like a prude but I'm really glad the one sex scene was a silly dance montage. Like, I know teens have sex and all, but that doesn't mean I wanna see them slobbering over each other. And I also liked the change of scenery! Very fun overall, of course it's not a high brow filmé, but I think for what it is, a silly campy gore-fest, it does it's job damn well.",ir4o2y

g4yxkru,"The Babysitter 2 - 3/10 - I liked the way the first one wrapped up. There was a nice hero's journey, the main character goes through his trials and comes out a young man. He faces all these different obstacles, shirtless jacked guy being this incarnate masculinity that he wasn't able to access. All and all, pretty good. 

I was very interested to see how the second one would follow that up. I haven't brushed up on my Joseph Campbell. The hero's journey continues, and does so brilliantly when handled right. The original Star Wars trilogy being the prime example of this structure. These things have to be these long sagas if you want them to be handled right.

This movie decided to say ""yeah fuck that, memory erase!"". 

Goddamn. 

They brought some more lore in, we get some backstory. The entire thing's framed around Faust's bargain. None of that really plays out. Faust gets what he was after and eventually tricks the devil himself. Didn't really follow through with that in this one.

As a surrogate for a continued journey we have the introduction of a new female character. So we can kind-of-sort-of replay the original. 
This movie is still firmly rooted in the almost ADHD style of the original but has a lot less impact. The gore is almost all CGI. It's not nearly as charming or heartfelt as the original. I think it exemplifies classic horror - in that it's mostly schlock. But, you know, not enjoyable schlock.

definitely made me want a third one, though i don't see a feasible way they could keep this particular plot going without truly bringing out some unbelievable shit. i do love the vibe of these movies though, and the main guy and samara weaving are both fantastic. my only wish is to have seen phoebe kick more ass, i feel like she didn't fight as much as she could've.",ir4o2y

I'm tired of seeing kids and teenagers be sexual and sexualized on TV.  I don't need to see or want to see kids being romantic and sexual with one another. 

The first movie was fun though. It's unfortunate that they went this route with the 2nd film.

g4weme2,"I thought this movie wasn't going to work without Bee leading the charge but they really did make it work wonderfully.  All the other members of the cult from the first film really stepped up.  Max, John, Allison and even Sonja all shined.  
    

I think my favorite was the kick in the dick callback.  ""You found my dick that time.""  I totally forgot the scene in the first one where Cole kicks him in the dick and he doesn't even flinch until that happened.  
    

Also the flashback where he's at the fast food restaurant with the name tag on while fucking shirtless cracked me up.  
  
Or Allison falling through the window of the house boat or posing on the boulder when she needs to rest lol.  Just overall a lot of random funny moments.  I even thought the piss to the face was funny, 'weak stream my ass!'  
  
It basically felt like the first film all over again with different jokes, which was fine by me because I would happily watch several more if they keep making them this funny.    
  
I also enjoy that they never even pretend to be serious, like the ridiculous guidance counselor/nurse bit in the beginning.    
  
Oh and the opening was great with the double basketball to the head and the dude in the background going 'suck it!'  
  
I'd give the first one a solid 8/10 and this one probably a 7.  The biggest thing that hurts it is that Samara Weaving absolutely carries the first act of the first film.  In Killer Queen, with just Cole in High School, it doesn't quite land that first act as well.",ir4o2y

g6x5a0i,"That’s a good point. I kind of wish they’d explored that idea in the movie though. She felt like such a flat character which was sad after such an amazing antagonist in the first film. 

It just felt like a lame joke about Gen Z-ers. I wish they’d hinged such a shift on more than a joke, especially for a character who was one of Coles only points of solace in the first movie.",ir4o2y
g90x6pp,"I don't think you're supposed to think that deeply about it. I think it's just supposed to be a very literal interpretation about how people who want fame will throw anyone under the bus to achieve it. Thats why almost every revived character has this silly motivation backstory interjected before their death scene, except for maybe Sonya and Max who are just psychotic. 

Like, it already seemed very out of character for her to be in a relationship with a guy who seems to bully Cole and yet support Cole at every turn and even show blatant interest in him. I think, in looking at how a lot of these high school romance movies/tv shows work, it's kind of a slight nod to that discreption in character motivations in the genre. Usually the love interest is like that because they don't recognize the protagonist's affiections or that their boyfriend is an asshole. In this movie she is aware of both plays off of that to A. Get her boyfriend to join her cult and B. To manipulate the boy who likes her into fulfilling the cult's objectives.",ir4o2y

Don’t even get me started on the changes in the ritual and the fact that for most of the movie it feels like his parents are gaslighting Cole and everyone just thinks the babysitter was just a figment of his imagination but then the dad is like Bee where have you been at the end of the story. Or the fact that the mid credit scene in the first film shows Bee stabbing a firefighter after escaping. Some change of heart right?,ir4o2y

gk3922r,">Samara was the main reason I got interested in the 1st movie.

It was the first movie with her that I saw, immediately became a big fan, and proceeded to hunt and watch everything else she's been in, including her tiny role in her uncle's movie *Mystery Road*, and the  obscure Australian indie *Bad Girl*, which is actually not bad (I still can't find *Squirrel Boys*, though).

Apart from *The Babysitter*, her best movies as a lead have to be *Ready or Not* and *Mayhem*. She was also great in her small role in *Three Billboards*, but then everybody was in that cast.",ir4o2y

g52o7bb,Yeah it reminds me of a scouts guide to a zombie apocalypse which I also loved,ir4o2y
g6iuphc,"> but the whole Melanie turning evil is such a massive betrayal and a huge shift from the original and it is barely even addressed

Okay, I have no idea why so many people feel this way. Its making me feel like I've forgotten large amounts of the first film. 

But I watched it two nights ago.

Melanie's role in the first film is extremely minor, like only slightly more important than the bully minor. I'd honestly be surprised if you told me she had more than ten minutes total of screentime.

Her only personality trait was that she had a crush on Cole, and that still existed in the second film. She had multiple lines which implied that she actually did like Cole, and was jealous of Phobe such as,

""Back there, the way he looks at you, that's the same way he used to look at me""

and

""I'm prettier than you"" 

Hell, her kiss scene with Cole makes no sense if she didn't like him at least a little bit.  
If anything, Bee's shift from evil (with hints of good) to completely good felt way more jarring than Melanie's shift did. In the first movie was that she was a psycho killer/demon who had a soft spot for Cole and in the second she's a lawful good martyr who only sold her soul to satan because she wanted to save a little girl.",ir4o2y
g6a49yl,It was a fun film that simultaneously ruined the first one,ir4o2y
garq1yt,"I also had an issue with Bee essentially sacrificing Cole's best friend for no reason to help start this new cult to fulfill her plans. It was convoluted and Bee got someone Cole deeply cares about, someone who helped Cole, killed, and was someone who besides being a superficial biatch would have otherwise been innocent.

I didn't get that motivation at all. Why did it have to be Melanie starting this new cult? Why couldn't Bee just pick the worst bully or something?

At that point I honestly expected the ending twist to be that Cole's family and school and community were all in on it, gaslighting him to try to get him to doubt the experiences of their first failure to sacrifice him",ir4o2y
gk35h4d,"There's one simple answer to all of this. The first movie had one screenwriter, Brian Duffield (who also wrote the brilliant *Love and Monsters*).

gk39m34,">why they chose to depict medications for mental health almost in a negative light (in my opinion) when they help a lot of people.

Hollywood still does that a lot. To be fair, though, these were medications forcedly administered to a healthy person, so you can see it as an indictment of overmedicating children, if you're willing to take anything from this movie as being seriously thought out.",ir4o2y
g4zyuwa,"I don’t think Mel is in the cult in the first film. The flash back shows her in her current age being taken in to the cult. I think the bullpen comment is more that Bee “drafted” her after the failed first attempt.

What I gathered is those who sign the book keep coming back until there is a winner, either the book signers or Cole. Bee knew this (and she wasn’t defeated). So she set up a scheme to take out all of the demons and find Cole the right girl cause I guess maybe she can tell Mel isn’t the right one? Which she confirms by being able to have her give up Cole for fame. So she sets everything up to have Mel take Cole out, him meet the new girl, fall for her, then become impure and kill them all.

Convoluted as fuck lol",ir4o2y
g51fww1,"> Bee’s motive for selling her soul getting the retcon treatment — wanting to be strong and confident. Now she did it save Phoebe?

g4z8jh3,"Im kinda confused too. To what Bee's role recruiting shits. The thing with her is like the devil lend her what she wants (saving Phoebe) not the other character to drink then get what they want. So what's her motive in the first movie?

g6x1p3t,"> Bee’s motive for selling her soul getting the retcon treatment — wanting to be strong and confident. Now she did it save Phoebe?

To be fair, it can be both. I don't think the first movie is her first deal with the devil

If I had to justify it, I'd say she saved Phoebe and then knew about the power of the devil shit and used it for herself. She had to become the expert somehow",ir4o2y
g9rmk39,"> More cartoony, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I don’t think it’s executed as well as it could be (that video game fight scene, Juan admonishing Melanie as she kills him, etc.)

also that scene where they arrive at the lake and everyone is...dancing? And just acting ridiculously over the top like teens having pg-rated fun. And then Melanie has a line like ""omg everyone's having so much fun isn't it great?!""

I was like...this isn't how humans act in real life lol.",ir4o2y
g5yg1lq,They said that they would keep coming back every two years until the ritual was completed. Bee mentions that Cole changed her that night. I'm assuming that she knew that the rest of the group would come back to try to kill Cole again so she set everything up so that Cole wins.,ir4o2y

I think the writers took a short cut with this one. They didn't want to develop the Cole character at all so they did the memory erase thing.

She got with a guy, Jimmy, who was a carbon copy of her father. Hello daddy issues!

You didn't have to drink the blood in order to achieve the cult's objective in the first one. 

I couldn't tell if that discrepancy was supposed to be a set up for the next movie in this series or if it was just really weird writing to show that Bee's just very morally ambiguous, since Melanie mentioned how she knew about the book but never really explained how it even came into her hands.",ir4o2y

g514pai,"Reeaaaaally upset with what they did with Melanie and Bee in this movie, they seem to have flipped their whole personality for no reason. It's a shame cause I think the premise could have really worked if it was just Melanie and Cole vs the returned crew of the first movie.",ir4o2y
g5346n9,"Thanyou. Goddamn I thought I was crazy reading this thread. How the fuck did anyone find this movie funny at all. It was so bad. And yeah, I also thought the first one was great, it was fresh, legitimately scary, and had very few poor decisions made by cole (whereas most horror movie protags have the decision making skills of a toddler). Also the character development and it was genuinely funny. 

Then in the second one Cole has somehow regressed from when he was 12? At least kid-Cole had balls, teen Cole just kept fucking up.",ir4o2y

g5x3g7p,"Okay but there's a difference between this movie and cuties. This movie only showed kissing and making out. Sure it talked about sex, and it had pictures of symbols of sex(flower opening, rocket taking off etc.) But during the entire movie the characters were fully clothed. And if you are going to try to compare this movie of 16 year olds making out to a movie of 9 year olds grabbing their crotches and exposing themselves then that is a whole other problem. I just don't see in what light these two movies are even comparable. And there's no way that this is one of the movies that are sexualizing children. And you said that they aren't allowed to be romantic either. I mean the characters in this movie were juniors in high school. There's no way around having at least some romantic aspects. If you have a problem with the movie being to try hard, fine, but I don't think that this movie was in your face at all with the sex scene.",ir4o2y

6/10 whole the first movie was an 8/10. It's still a good movie but it was all over the place. Not something I'd watch twice compared to the original.

If we take the logic of the movie at face value, Bee sacrificed Cole's only true friend to enact her plan to save him. Like why did it have to be Melanie? If we take the reality of the movie, then sure Melanie may have been two-faced and superficial, but otherwise she would have been innocent of killing. And Bee condemned her to hell just like that.

-get out of his chair after the cops die and runs straight upstairs instead of outside

-gets away entirely when he’s in the barn. Instead of running away he decides to go the the crawl space 

-once he’s a avoided cult girl in the crawl space decides to flick the spider before the cult girl is gone

-In Melanies house they both have the opportunity to run outside while Bee is in the back of the house. Instead they run through a narrow hall into the bathroom

-...where Cole promptly leaves her

-while back in his house Cole decides to poke around the cheerleaders body for far too long

-once he gets away for like the 4th time takes melanie’s dads car and ramps it into his house

He does smart things in that movie too, but he has the chance to totally escape like 4 times.

In the second movie how much dumb stuff does he really do? Nothing dumb on the party boat, he just gets away. Then he saves Phoebe from the creepy guy...and idk I can’t think of anything overtly dumb he did. He runs over the creepy girl. They deal with cheerleader girl. They steal the other boat and Cole kills Max. Then they’re hiding out. Cole only comes out because he knows his dad is basically dead if he doesn’t. Then his dad needles him while feigning a hug. And finally he gives himself up for Phoebe. 

I loved both but they’re both just silly fun movies with plenty of questionable decision making all around (especially by the cult). The second movie’s comedy was definitely cheesier though. While there were some highs that were funnier than the first movie (Cole you fucking stud!), there was a lot that was way goofier (like the fight with the cheerleader or the fight between Phoebe and Melanie)",ir4o2y

She is told to offer them 'their hearts desire' to get them to make the deal. 

She goes around recruiting, as we see in flashbacks, and then they start doing the devils bidding, making sacrifices and using the blood of the innocent. 

She gets sucked into the world, the power is so intoxicating she eventually loses herself to it, becoming who we see in the first one. Someone strong instead of weak etc. But in the process of leading this cult she forms a bond with Cole, as she has to protect him since he is 'top shelf' innocent blood. On the night he kills her she is changed, she 'snaps out of it' so to speak and is no longer intoxicated by the power being offered by the devil. She decides her goal from here on is to free Cole no matter the cost. 

She has to wait 2 years, per the ritual. 

The devil has her assemble a new cult, as the old one failed, but Bee ultimately drags her feet on this, allowing Melanie to take the reigns specifically to set the plan in motion. 

Melanie has no desire to be more than friends with Cole, Bee knows this and she also knows that Cole is so hung up on Melanie that he won't even think about Phoebe, like that, unless something happens to Mel.

She knows Phoebe is the type of girl to find Cole's quirkiness alluring, she knows that under the right conditions, Cole and Phoebe could be perfect for each other. So she does what she has to to get them both in the same area. 

She primes Phoebe with the bunny and the note. 

All of this is done specifically to get Cole laid, as after that he won't be 'innocent'. 

Bee couldn't be sure it would happen, too many variables etc, but she hoped her plan would work. You can see the slight grin on her face as she watches her crew drink. She knows both Cole and Phoebe well enough to already know.

Ultimately, Bee is the best wingman a kid could ever hope for. ;p",ir4o2y

Personally moments like the name tag on Robbie Amell's pecs, the ""He just wants to kill people"", Allison posing on the rock, when the ghosts first appeared, etc. etc. were funny to me, though I do admit I have a very silly sense of humor. But also, overall things like the Apache scene or the Mortal Kombat-esque fight were just plain joyful for me, I couldn't help but have fun. My comment was mostly annoyed at n00bvin implying people finding a silly movie fun to be a terrible thing. If you didn't have fun watching the movie that's ok, but the fact that I did doesn't mean I'm a victim of mindless ""collective taste""",ir4o2y
g5yxs79,"Okay well first of all I never said I enjoy watching teens screw in the media. That is so far from what I said. I said that I don't think that this particular movie is an example of sexualizing kids. There is a difference. And by the way no one saw them screw in this movie. So I don't think that you saying that because I'm defending a movie (that actually specifically omitted anything but the characters making out) against being related to pedophilia in any way that I enjoy watching teens screw in the media. This isn't pedophilia. Cuties is pedophilia. That's why I brought that movie up. Because you called them both pedophilia but in reality these movies shouldn't even be mentioned in the same category. And if you're 

>tired of seeing kids make out, fuck, be romantic, and sexual onscreen.

Let's go down that list. Making out is what teens do. That to me isn't a problem to show in a movie that is rated TV-14 and up. If you're tired of seeing teens make out in movies that's not going to stop. If it makes you uncomfortable, that's fine, but don't compare it to pedophilia because they wanted their characters to have a romance in the movie. I don't see any other way to show this. Okay second on the list is fuck. They didn't fuck on screen. And also if you're talking about sex being mentioned later or hinted at in photos during the scene, then it was mentioned yes. But it wasn't just a scene thrown in their because the director was like, ""Hey, guys let's make these teens fuck"" it was a scene that later tied into the actual plot of the movie. And again I don't think that the scene you're talking about is pedophilia. The romantic part I talked about in my last comment. But I think it's highly unfair to criticize this movie for making teens have romantic relationships. There are PG movies with teens having romantic relationships. I don't see how in any universe this could be construed as pedophilia. And as for the sexual onscreen it is too broad of a topic and I can't really tell what you're referring to in this particular movie so I'm gonna leave that one. 

Okay now im done. You said you didn't want to argue but then you compared me to someone who enjoys watching teens screw so I had to say something. You are also allowed to dislike what you dislike but when you state that a movie is pedophilia or related at all to pedophilia I feel that you should have to see my point of view in where I see that that is so far from the truth.",ir4o2y
gklyw3t,"i delete my comments so i forget exactly what i said but i believe it was along the line of "" i'm tired of people being disturbed by teenagers having sex "" you go on to compare teenagers fucking on screen to ""people screwing animals and eating their own feces and shooting dope in their genitals"". to compare these things shows me you have serious perception problems, you must realize your an asshole. teenagers are human beings and part of being young is fucking. if you are disturbed by teenagers having sex, which you are, then don't watch a film with teenagers, unless it's explicitly a kids flick and if you have teenage kids, they probably fuck. get over it, it's natural and to be grossed out by it tells me you have some kind of a problem.",ir4o2y

g5scayv,"I feel like they *did* repeat a lot of twists for the second movie and in so doing they have created a formula.  Simply put, the formula is that in the 3rd movie, the “girl next door” will trade places with the “babysitter” so that while she appeared entirely evil in movie #2 she can find redemption at the end of #3 while the “manic pixie” girl from movie #2 takes over the villain role for movie #3.  The “manic pixie’s” deal with the devil will likewise not be revealed until movie #4, allowing her to redeem herself then.   Meanwhile they shuffle in a new love interest for Cole and do their damnedest to make you think there is no way she could be a satanic cult leader.

I hope they break from it for the third movie but they’ll have a hard time doing so successfully. I’d appreciate variations on the formula as well.  That’s what I mean by like.. I’d love if his dad turned out to be evil.",ir4o2y
g6aaagr,"I’d be fine with a tangential story.  Not a rehash.  Just another story in the same universe. 

I like the concept of someone’s world crumbling around them because the people they trust and look up to the most turn out to be satanic cult members who need his blood, or his kids blood or whatever.  I do like the trope of all of the demons being after Cole and Cole alone, but the whole “purity” thing gives an opening for them to find someone more pure than Cole because he had sex or whatever.  I think if you bail on the cast you should at least keep 1 or 2 of the cult members around to tie the stories together.",ir4o2y
g60m3vt,"Teens and children being sexual onscreen has been a prime source of American media for decades. It's so normalized at this point that no one is allowed to comment negatively about it. Even though that these kids being forced to do sexual scenes on screen are ALSO abused behind the scenes by these media mongols. The extent of which has been very publically highlighted and still largely ignore by the masses. 

You keep bringing up cuties as a comparison. I never compared cuties. Teens making out, implying sex, masturbating, etc. is sexual. It's a form of grooming, and I wouldn't be shocked if one of these kids comes out in the next 5 years to say that someone on this set sexually exploited them.

I don't care if making out is what teens do. I don't want to see it in media. Where I grew up teens were also shooting up heroin into their genitals, fucking animals, and killing each other/themselves. Teens do a significant amount of thing enmass. That doesn't mean that everything that teenager does needs to be put in media.  

The sex scene in this movie wasn't necessary. They needed the blood of an innocent, not the blood of a virgin. The first movie depreciated how pure the main character was because of his childish innocence, not due to the lack of use of his genitals. The first movie even implied over and over again how ""wholesome"" the kid was. 

I don't care what you think is ""unfair"". I'm allowed to have my opinion. You and everyone have decades of films to enjoy kids screwing, making out, touching, and  being romantic on film. 

You're right, this type of media isn't going anywhere. And people are still going to act oblivious and obtuse about how this type of media contributes the sexual exploitation of children in media.",ir4o2y
gkm0dtw,"I find it disturbing that after 4 months, not only are you still obsessing over this conversation, but that is the conclusion that you came to about the conversation.

I don't care about teenagers being sexually interested in one another in their own personal lives. 

I do care about the narrative of teenage and childhood sexuality being peddled in the media. The  same media that sexually exploits and abuses children and teens. 

There is a difference between teens exploring their sexuality in private amongst themselves and the pedophila of the media promoting and exploiting teen sexuality. 

If you're confused by this, thats not my problem. I'm not going to argue with someone who thinks that it's cute or endearing to watch children or teens be sexual on tv. If you get pleasure out of viewing that, then you aren't someone that I have any interest in talking to.",ir4o2y
