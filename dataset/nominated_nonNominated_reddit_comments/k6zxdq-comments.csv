gf0pl9m,"I imagine that watching Mank without any previous knowledge of Citizen Kane and the social circles of contemporary Hollywood will be like watching Avengers Endgame without having seen anything else from the MCU. It’s for insiders. It relies on the audience’s repertoire to work. And in this case, that makes for some sort of elitist film (that’s not a critique, just a statement of fact).

The movie is rigid to the point of becoming dull, except for a few sequences when it comes to life, usually relying on the impact of the dialogues, that are well-written and theatrical, but not strong enough to turn the film into an insightful character study. For instance: a lot is said about politics, but the script never addresses the roots of Mank’s political ideology or, for that matter, any of his personality traits and relationships (or lack of). No wonder Amanda Seyfriend is being hailed as the MVP, since she’s the only one that establishes some meaningful connection with Mank and adds a much needed humanity to his character.

Overall, it’s form over substance, and that’s also true when it comes to Fincher’s directorial choices (his attempt to replicate the aesthetics of the time eventually works against the movie, like the obvious script headings leading to flashbacks). As an admirer of Citizen Kane and a movie-buff, I was eager to love Mank, but, IMO, it’s just too bland, too empty to even earn a spot amongst Fincher’s best.",k6zxdq

ghgshpv,"My favourite scene was the first dinner party, the one with Charlie Chaplin at the piano. The back-and-forth argument about politics was perfectly directed.

The first half of the movie was well constructed, I was surprised that only an hour had passed. The second half was very messy, it was clear that the script had been reworked so that the narrative reflected the 2016 presidential election. Mank becoming Hollywood Bernie Sanders felt like a stretch of reality.",k6zxdq
geojrh4,"Technically amazing, with great performances, but the movie failed to connect with me on any other level. Dense script, that asks to rewatch the movie, but i din’t think i will. Just felt a little cold. Like some movies you connect with, and some you look through the window from the outside. That was the latter.

And i just can’t wrap my head around Fincher going as far as to record/mix the audio to emulate films of the time, Reznor and Ross recording entirely period-appropriate soundtrack, but shooting it on digital and in widescreen? Weird decision.",k6zxdq
geo231w,"I've been waiting for this discussion thread! A few thoughts:

* I've only seen 20 minutes of Emily in Paris and I wasn't a fan, but man... Lily Collins absolutely shines in this movie in her limited appearance.
* I absolutely loved Tom Burke as Welles. He had that air of confidence and invincibility that I'd expect from a 24 year old Orson Welles at the height of his radio popularity.
* The sound design was strangely unsettling for me at first, but I got used to it after fifteen minutes. 
* Absolutely loved the montage at the GOP election party.
* I don't know how, but this movie feels so old but so new at the same time.",k6zxdq
geryezu,Why did the last five minutes suddenly turn into a vanquishing of Orson Welles as the antagonist when Hearst/his cronies were the antagonists the whole time?  Looking back I see the subtext there but the ending speech and title card made it wildly explicit out of nowhere.  Left me less high on the movie than I was up until that point.,k6zxdq
geofqvv,"Enjoyable trip through the period and the dialogue felt sharp enough that I sometimes wondered if Aaron Sorkin had wrote the screenplay, but there didn't seem a real point to anything? 

Considering what the movie's billed as, there's almost no detail about Mank's relationship with Hearst or Marion Davies. I guess his friend's death was suppose to be his rosebud but it was hard to care when the film spent no time with the character beforehand. 

And there was no climax, no drama about whether the film would be made or not. I kept waiting for that moment that would flip the film into a different gear and it never came. Felt like we were still in the middle of act two when it just... ends.",k6zxdq

geoq681,"Does Fincher hate Orson Welles or what? Because I can't really understand that ending unless there are some deeply embedded personal feelings about Welles. 

Welles throwing a tantrum + the cutting of Welles and Mank's acceptance speeches to make it seem like this was more than just a playful exchange between two colleagues was a really bizarre end that didn't work with the film I had just watched for two hours.

I enjoyed large parts of this and thought it was maybe Oldman's career best work. But that ending felt totally out of place.",k6zxdq
geo488q,"I think I loved this movie? I loved the (inaccurate, I know) discussions of old Hollywood politics. I loved the Kane-esque structure. I loved the score, Reznor and Ross should change up their style/instrumentation more often? 
One thing I loved about Oldman’s performance is that his aloofness becomes more strained as the world around him becomes more serious. I’d bet most actors’ instinct would be to drop the aloofness as time goes on, but Oldman lets you see him struggle to keep it up.
My only real complaint is the false artifacts inserted in the “film”. It was infrequent and mechanical, and took me out of the scene instead of drawing me into the time period.",k6zxdq

gfhs4yr,"(Long-form thoughts!) I think *Mank* is a good movie, but it didn't feel like it was pushed to the Fincher Standard. There's a ton to like on a technical level. It was beautifully shot, the acting across the board was top-notch, and it was interesting to hear a Reznor/Ross score that reached way back instead of their usual sound. And even the script, though as meandering as a script can get, has some awesome dialogue.

Even some of the history was nicely done. William Randolph Hearst would often seat the guests he found most intriguing nearest him and getting sat away was akin to being demoted. So to see Mank near the center at the beginning of the film, then off at the very edge at the end was a nice little show of just how far Mank had fallen.

Everything else was a confusion of subplots vying for dominance. I kept mentally comparing *Mank* to *The Aviator* the entire time, which was also about a film auteur who fell from grace. I had never seen *Hell's Angels*, but Scorsese was able to integrate enough of the film and even show enough of its production to drive home why it was of personal importance to Hughes in context. Not just because of the subject matter, but there were real stakes if he failed.

*Mank* takes a similar approach, but frequently gets distracted. Mank's relationship with Hearst is supposed to be the inciting incident for his agreement to take on *Citizen Kane*, but he's in all of two or three scenes with Hearst. We never really see a relationship build until it's already deteriorated. It's also supposed to be about him butting heads with Orson Welles, but we don't see this until literally the end of the third act.

It also tries to be about Mank's antagonistic relationship with the higher-ups at MGM, but we never see him *do anything*. That dovetails into the plotline involving Mayer and Upton Sinclair that honestly felt out of place in the grand scheme of things. I know it's supposed to help draw out Mank's commitment to principle over all else, but the cynical side of me felt like that entire plotline was there to allow for yet another instance of someone all but looking into the camera and making an uninteresting connection between Nazi Germany and modern politics. I understand the script was written years ago by Fincher's father, but there's just no way that particular point wasn't sharpened for Netflix.

But I think the biggest sin that the movie commits is that it has absolutely *no* interest in giving us any insight into the development of *Citizen Kane*. It doesn't show anything. It barely shows Orson. Their clash comes so late it's pretty much relegated to the epilogue. In that sense, a great deal of *Mank* feels like one of those low-budget unauthorized biopics, where they have absolutely no rights to the original film. We can't connect Mank to his own work, unlike how Scorsese was able to connect Hughes to *Hell's Angels*, *Scarface*, and even the construction of the *Hercules*. Mank gets drunk in the Mojave Desert and finishes the script off-screen.

*Mank* pretty much feels like a companion piece to *Citizen Kane*, and that's kinda frustrating because it should be able to stand on its own. And it has so much to say about all sorts of things that never really coalesce, so it also doesn't feel like it even succeeds at being a good biography. Like, when the character that's barely in the movie talks about how Mank sponsored her entire German village to allow them entrance into the US. *Where was that stuff?* That sounds crazy and interesting, and really plays into Mank's commitment to principle better than the Sinclair stuff. It was a play against Nazi Germany but also, by extension, against MGM because they refused to stop showing films there--which was beyond problematic for Mank, being Jewish himself. But that's all pushed into a throw-away line by a character who had no other reason to be there but to deliver that line.

So as-is, *Mank* was great on a technical and acting level. But everything involving plot and character feel like afterthoughts. So we're left with an alcoholic protagonist who cheats on his wife and leaves her to fend for herself back in NY, and, after being slighted by no one in particular, decides to punch up at the establishment by writing a movie off-screen. I know this was a passion project for Fincher, so that's that, but I feel like there was such potential here for something more epic.",k6zxdq
gg0n620,"This movie is rose colored glasses for old Hollywood and much like any sort of lense it magnifies an image and refracts it; showing all the scars and blemishes of a bygone era but much at the same time romanticizing it. Fincher has this modern way of looking at old but important movie with such new eyes, in a way that one would argue that it seems like history repeating itself. Some would possibly find the political message in the film to be exhausting especially with the modern climate but it's all to magnify the relationship of the main character whose riddled with vices and flaws but none more so than the burden of Wit. Which the main character and the screenwriting shares ten fold. The score and sound ripped straight from the aforementioned bygone era that I can't help but watch and marvel. 

10/10 Fantastic and flawless in delivery and tone that I am remissed to give it a score any lower",k6zxdq
gepq8vy,"Love Fincher, love Gary Oldman, and  I love Citizen Kane...but I just didn't get this one. Story wise I feel like it focused on some of the least interesting aspects of one of the most interesting making-of stories in the history of cinema. The ""washed-up alcoholic screenwriter"" character is kind of overdone...it's hard to bring anything new to that type of portrayal, even when their background is so rich. Not enough screentime for any of the characters/actors I was looking forward to seeing (Charles Dance, Amanda Seyfield...a disappointing lack of Orson Welles).

There are some great performances throughout (even if they did fuck Orson over) but I can't get over how glossy some of those images looked, and CGI animals? Please... It's a pretty contradiction. Fincher is more concerned with being a digital technician than a filmmaker here. Hopefully he makes a return to form on his next one, although it's starting to seem like nothing will ever knock Zodiac off its throne.",k6zxdq

geo25g9,"Saw this a few weeks ago and have been dying to talk about it.  As a die hard Fincher and Citizen Kane fan, I came in with relatively low expectations for this. I love Fincher in part for how obsessed he is with the perverse, fucked up parts of our world, and a story about a screenwriter’s creative struggles just felt totally disconnected from his other work. But this movie actually feels very much of a piece with the cool, slick nature of the rest of his work. 

This is a movie about smart guys making good work, an obvious obsessive point with Fincher, but it weirdly feels like his warmest work yet. This movie is spectacular. I love the sharp, witty dialogue of Mank, and the political paralells, though kind of obvious, are effectively thought provoking. Overall, I’m just happy to see Fincher make a movie again.

gesdeft,"I absolutely love this film. 

Some thoughts: 

-	I am baffled at the discourse on this movie by critics and film writers that continue to focus on “the Welles/Mankiewicz battle over authorship” as this is an extremely insignificant part of the story being told by this movie
-	Mank is absolutely not parroting the Pauline Kael opinions and honestly, the focus on Welles being the main antagonist is a glaring misrepresentation of the story
-	Mank is a story about guilt, power, and the use creative talent
-	The meaning of the organ grinder’s monkey parable and the way it is revealed in the film is brilliant and underscores the power dynamics exposed by the movie
-	Mank’s recognition, seen via the constant flashbacks, that his talent—his wit, clever insights—is either being mined by his puppet masters for their benefit or simply to be the clever, drunk jester at their dinner parties and that his work in Hollywood is largely without substance until he decides to truly use his creativity is superb
-	The key scene for me is the one in which Mank, speaking to Irving Thalberg, casually trashes the executives—executives of a movie studio, a place that supposedly fosters creativity—with functionally infinite resources as not being creative enough to do something as simple as smearing a political opponent which seemingly sparks the idea of using propaganda films against Sinclair which in turn causes a sequence of events that leads to the suicide of Mank’s friend, that entire sequence of events pairs so well with the political themes of public opinion manipulation and control of mass media in Citizen Kane (also of note is that David Fincher’s music video production company was called Propaganda Films)

I could spend hours talking about Fincher’s already much discussed meticulousness and the greatness of the cinematography, the score, and the editing but I am sure all that is more than covered in this thread and elsewhere. The performances are top notch as well with particular emphasis on Oldman, Seyfried, and Collins.",k6zxdq
geumcnp,"I kinda loved it but I admit it works much better for those who have seen Citizen Kane and know about 1940s Hollywood. It throws you in the mix with very little context or explanation, seems more interested in offering parallels with 2020. But it works. Oldman is terrific. 

Also, and I could be wrong, but I felt casting a 61-year Oldman as a mid-40s Mankiewicz was intentional? Mank looked way older than he appeared in real life so rather than putting an aging up someone else, just get Gary Oldman. I’ve seen some people complain about this but I do think that was the point on Fincher’s end.",k6zxdq

Mank is so self assured and so apathetic for so many years. Dude knows how slimy and corrupt Hollywood is but stays quiet. Keeps his ideals drowned in booze, shit talks people but doesn't actually do anything. Instead of Kane losing his ideals it's Mank starting to act on his idealism.

Was the movie factually accurate? Of course not. How many scripts get made without any rewrites? Even Mank was adding to the script at the last minute. But that's such an afterthought to the story Fincher was telling.",k6zxdq

gevqqto,"I already put some story analysis and deeper thoughts on Mank in a couple other comments in this thread but I wanted to come back and comment on Mank and its function as metatext. While I think Mank is an instant masterpiece I don’t believe you must like it to fully appreciate what David Fincher has done with this movie. 

After first watching the movie I was struck by how many described this movie as about authorship, “battle for credit”, over a masterwork of cinema. Mank is absolutely not about credit for Citizen Kane or addressing who the actual genius is, Welles or Mankiewicz, rather it is about the motivation for a story as subversive as Citizen Kane and how does something like that get made despite a system—like the old Hollywood studio system—that is designed to be mass production of entertainment for the “customers” as Mayer, in Mank, constantly refers to the audience. The studio system does not foster creativity or make room for individual expression, originality, and subversiveness, something like Citizen Kane. Two standout quotes from the Mayer character in Mank illuminate this point:

>	This is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory. What he bought still belongs to the man who sold it, that’s the real magic of the movies

***The Mayer character delivers that gem immediately before telling the cogs of his assembly line that he is cutting wages***

>	I’m not interested in educating our customers, you want to send a message? Call Western Union

That type of mindset, that kind of business leaves no room for subversiveness or provocation or the creative expression seen in movies like Citizen Kane.

Welles is not the antagonist of this movie. Mayer and Hearst, the Hollywood power brokers are the antagonists. The system is antagonistic to Mank and Welles. All of this is happening during the formation of the Guilds and the workers in Hollywood unionizing. 

The flashbacks in Mank show what caused Mank to feel the guilt and responsibility and what he observed from within the system which served as motivation to write the story. Ultimately, it does not matter what creative percentages one assigns to Mankiewicz and Welles for the story of Citizen Kane, what matters is the kind of people it took to make it: creative, iconoclastic people willing to fight against the pressures of the system. 

Mank is an original, personal movie about how original, personal movies get made despite the pressures, obstacles, finances, personal demons, and petty squabbles working against the creative process. 

Other metatextual elements of note:

-	The line about not being able to sum up a person’s life in two hours
-	Fincher making this movie within the streaming service “system”
-	The filmmaking techniques used for Mank which mirror those of Citizen Kane
-	Hollywood being the propaganda arm of political actors and power brokers
-	And of course Mank, which ends with Oscar victories, itself being a movie immediately referred to—due to it checking all of the traditional boxes—as Oscar bait while being about the sociopolitical issues in old Hollywood and labor disputes considering Louis B Mayer created the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in an attempt to squash the uprising of labor unions in Hollywood",k6zxdq
gg8hm7j,"Suprised at the reaction a bit here. I was really impressed with this one and was engrossed for the whole time. I do understand how you could not like it, if you didnt connect with Mank and his principles, since there is little in urgency and stakes throughout it, but I suppose I was just swept up in the era, snappy dialogue, and politics of the society and movies. 
Haven't seen Citizen Kane for reference, but liked this Fincher significanty more than Girl with Dragon Tattoo, which I saw the other night.",k6zxdq
gf2v6f5,I loved Arliss Howard as Louis B. Mayer. He stole every scene he was in. Hope he get at least an Oscar nomination.,k6zxdq
ggckcbh,Brutal fist half. Amazing second,k6zxdq
grgbyy2,"I like biopics, so of course I was going to see this. This is a movie of Hollywood legend. The central concept is the question: Why did Herman Mankiewicz and William Randolph Hearst fall out? Where did the vitriol in Citizen Kane come from? 

This film answers with, mainly, complete lies. They invent a close personal relationship between Mank and Marion Davies. They give Hearst a scene where he calls Mank a dancing monkey to his face. They make up a friend for Mank who hates Hearst and then kills himself. And least accurately of all, they portray Mank as having sympathies for Upton Sinclair's campaign. That *definitely* didn't happen. 

The most likely story, as far as I can tell, is that they were just two notorious assholes whose personalities clashed. Hearst was domineering and vindictive and Mank couldn't help himself from wryly insulting everyone he met. It makes a better movie to have it be a personal vendetta against a specific act, but real life often isn't that cinematic. 

Honestly, the stylistic elements don't add much. The typewriter titles and the black-and-white have been done before.The writing where they replace every single line of dialogue with a joke gets extremely frustrating, although unlike most movies written this way it's at least appropriate for the characters.",k6zxdq

getdyiw,"I already wrote about my thoughts on the film, but I just have to say that as a fan of classic Hollywood, I love the little stories and myths they put in:

* Mank really did send that note, but it was to Ben Hecht.

* Love the little cameos. The guy who hets called “banjo eyes” in the writer’s room is supposed to be Eddie Cantor. Charlie Chaplin is the guy at the piano during one of Hearst’s dinners. 

* Louis B. Mayer was known to a bit of actor himself. As portrayed during Thalberg’s funeral, Mayer had the ability to basically cry on demand and did.

* Speaking of Mayer, the scene when he tells the staff that they are getting pay cuts really happened.

* Mank really said the line about how the “white wine came up with the fish,” but it wasn’t at one of Hearst’s dinners.

* Mank did sponsor German refugees, some Jewish, but not a whole village. Also while the anti-Sinclair reels are real, the character os Metcalf is not and has no real life analogue. Finally, Mank wasn’t as liberal as he was portrayed in the film. Due to the horrors he saw serving in WWI, he was an isolationist. His friends joked he was “right of Lindbergh.” However, when reports started coming out regarding the discrimination facing Jews in Germany some of his friends wondered if he felt anything regarding  the plight of his fellow community. Mank wrote The Mad Dog of Europe in response to the Nazis and, when Pearl Harbor happened, tried to reenlist.",k6zxdq
genzd53,"I was actually surprised by how much I loved this movie. And that's not to say I had any doubts in Fincher, it just didn't seem to me that a movie about the writer of Citizen Kane would be that riveting. Not knowing the story I was unsure where the movie was going at first, but as it unfolded in its jumbled way I came to love and appreciate everyone involved and, most importantly, their perspectives on each other. Mix that with that interesting political themes and some good old fashioned appreciation for classic cinema and I can't wait to watch this again.

Amanda Seyfried was the standout here, I think. She absolutely killed her role as the curious and smart actress. Seen by many as locked in a castle to be a rich man's trophy wife when the truth is much more complex and loving than that. The way this movie paints certain characters by way of third party discussions then gives those characters a chance to defend themselves is not only brilliantly done, but in itself is an impressive homage to the whole idea of Citizen Kane. His wife, his brother, Charles Dance, even Mank himself are all portrayed or seen as something more shallow than they really are in this movie. It's a really fascinating movie about perspective and therefore it's about who gets to write that perspective. 

As much time as I could spend talking about the ins and outs of the characters and the many amazing ways this movie paid tribute to one of the original greats, I could spend as much time talking about the camerawork, how this movie truly feels like it was made a century ago. Simple things like the shot we'd get any time a car was approaching the house he was writing CK in or even that insane montage of images during election night really sold the feel. This movie feels old in so many more ways than just the black and white, and when a movie feels genuinely old it suddenly feels original. It's so close to the feeling I got when I first watched Citizen Kane. The thought that, yeah, maybe none of these camera angles or this rags to riches story are new to me now, but that's only because everyone's spend a hundred years imitating it. Obviously this movie is brand new but I'm just in awe at how it not only paid homage to one of the greatest films of all time, but how it matched the beats and made me feel like I was watching it with new eyes all over again. 

I love a good Fincher film but I have to say, I think he has truly shown how incredible he is with this movie. I'm not sure everyone will love it as much as I did, but I think anyone with an interest in classic cinema will get a lot out of it. 9/10.

I understand that there is no actual acceptance speech from Mank in real life, but a friend and I are in disagreement about whether the final scene is real in the context of the film; given that Mank says “if I could’ve given a speech” or something to that effect, and the general tongue in cheek nature of his response (not to mention the harrowing ending of “He was 55.”), I took that scene as an imagined scenario— the last word that Mank never gets to have. My friend disagrees and says (at least within the world of the film) the speech is actually happening. Any thoughts on this? It felt imagined/like a projection to me.",k6zxdq
geqwe2v,"Since they call Hearst “Pops,” I thought it was Marion’s father at first. 

The film has a lot of moving parts, and there are parts that I love. The GOP election sequence is a masterclass of directing. 

It has one flaw, and that it’s just filled with *stuff*. Lots of moving parts make the first half very complicated to follow. Especially keeping track of his screenwriting friends. But as it moves on, it’s one of the films that gets better and better as it goes on.

gf6abq0,I find this movie to be one of the greatest 'old Hollywood' commentary pieces and can be immensely enjoyed if the viewer has some context about the politics of what is going on at the time. someone who has studied history of Hollywood is going to follow this much better than some one like me who has limited knowledge. This being said I really enjoyed it despite my lack of context.,k6zxdq
geo2wkr,"I was really looking forward to this, and I'm happy to say that Fincher delivered. Mank, the character, was as clever and gregarious as I hoped he would be. I only had a cursory knowledge of the making of Citizen Kane, but was always fascinated by Mankiewicz. I never understood why he bit the hand that fed him. This story at least offers a clue. 

I don't know how true to life the Upton Sinclair story is, but for those who take it to heart, it's a great wakeup call to how manipulated and manufactured our emotions are not just for our politics and beliefs, but what we like to eat and buy and feel. But that thread seems to be dropped before it threatens to wake up too many of the unwashed masses.

I was intrigued by the classic look Fincher mimicked for the cinematography, but found the fake ""cigarette burns"" in the top right a bit overdone. Almost like he was using them as punctuation or to make a subliminal point. I could have done with 3 instead of the dozen or more that we got throughout. But that's really my only criticism. 

The film was a gem and left me feeling both happy and nostalgic. Especially when Welles calls Mank an alcoholic, when we know that's what Welles himself becomes. And the scene where Mank blows up his relationship with Hearst, where Dance, as Hearst, looks at Mank as if wanting to hear what he has to say, knowing that it's true, and letting him finish, while knowing that this is the last time he'll let him inside the sanctum. I also liked the last time Davies and Mank met, when Davies doesn't hold her portrayal against him, while also saying that she'll fight to shelve the film.

It had the feel of a true story, with enough artistic license to make it enjoyable. A great tribute by Fincher to his father.

""I'm 43, but that's very understanding."" Says a 61 year old Gary Oldman. At that time Mank would have been 43, though, which I thought was funny.",k6zxdq

There’s so much to praise from the breathtaking score and production design, to the acting and just how fucking funny this film is. 

Some quick thoughts.

Amanda Seyfried was a powerhouse in this movie and deserves all the love she’s been getting. The film is far more critical to old Hollywood and the shitty people that ran it, then I initially thought. Additionally the effort put into making it look like the film was just rediscovered after 70 years is insane.",k6zxdq

gf3ts3i,"I tried getting through this like 4 times over the weekend. Could never last more than 20 minutes, until I lost interest completely.

* I am a HUGE Fincher fan
* I am a HUGE Gary Oldman fan
* Have a lot of respect for *Citizen Kane*
* I love the Hearst lore and have visited the San Simeon ""castle"" 3 times
* I am a sucker for industry films

In the end, I was entertained but not blown away. I did love the old movie stylizing and the technical aspects to deliver the experience. I also appreciated the inclusion of the two younger female characters who weren't dopes.

Usually with Fincher's films, I'm riveted until the end. I wasn't so drawn into *Mank*. The Hearst character was such a stock villain. It felt like there needed to be a couple of scenes with Mank & Hearst bonding like 2 people, so that the betrayal/dissolvement of their relationship had more weight. An intimate scene with Seyfried & Dance would have been cool too. I don't mean a love scene per se, but just something without all the partygoers.",k6zxdq

Acting, especially from Oldman, was superb, although a lot of the supporting actors didn't really have much to do. The overall production quality was great. Some beautiful art direction going on and there were some specific scenes that I loved.

But... as a whole I found it hard to connect with either the characters or the story being told. Oldman as Mank is well acted, but we've seen the alcoholic, self-destructive writer trope before and I didn't feel like there was a lot new here. Most of the side characters beyond Mank (and there were certainly quite a few) appeared and disappeared almost at random, never really making much of an impact. The film seemed to act as though the viewer should intrinsically feel some kind of emotional attachment to these people (or at least feel as though they are *important*) but mostly never gives us any reason to do so. At times I felt like I was watching some kind of inside joke from the outside, like maybe all of this would click to people who had spent a lifetime working in the Hollywood system. Maybe so, but to me it mostly fell cold.

I just never got much of a sense of why this is a story that needed to be told. For what it has to say about Hearst you might as well just watch Citizen Kane, and Mank’s own story is so low-stakes and meandering I’m not really sure what I was expected to take from it. It doesn’t wring much drama out of the situation at all, so a lot of verbose, literate dialogue is pretty much all I’m left with.

And, his familiar presence behind the lens just sort of washes over everything. This is Fincher Movie. It’s all his creation. His fingerprints are everywhere

Mank is the first time as a heavyweight, I think he took a step back and allows the script and story to dictate his direction, instead of oversaturating it with his style.

And this movie is all the better for it. 

This story is clearly important to him. And to best tell that story, he knew he had to set aside ego, choose substance over his style, and get the hell out of the way.

geo7rg1,"Thought this quote was interesting from Fincher on Welles:

While Fincher is quick to applaud Welles for the clear talent the filmmaker had, the “Mank” director believes that Welles “was above all a showman and a juggler with this immense talent.”


“Well, I think Orson Welles’s tragedy lies in the mix between monumental talent and filthy immaturity,” explained Fincher. “Sure, there is genius in ‘Citizen Kane,’ who could argue? But when Welles says, ‘It only takes an afternoon to learn everything there is to know about cinematography,’ pfff… Let’s say that this is the remark of someone who has been lucky to have Gregg Toland around him to prepare the next shot… Gregg Toland, damn it, an insane genius!”

He continued, “I say that without wanting to be disrespectful to Welles, I know what I owe him, like I know what I owe Alfred Hitchcock, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, or Hal Ashby. But at 25, you don’t know what you don’t know. Period. Neither Welles, nor anyone. It doesn’t take anything away from him, and especially not his place in the pantheon of those who have influenced entire generations of filmmakers. But to claim that Orson Welles came out of nowhere to make ‘Citizen Kane’ and that the rest of his filmography was ruined by the interventions of ill-intentioned people, it’s not serious, and it is underestimating the disastrous impact of his own delusional hubris.”",k6zxdq

Maybe 'cause I have a thing for people who stand by their principles or ideals. Also, seeing how Mank created this great story from what he saw and experienced in his life was really cool.

People are saying, ""oh the story/plot ain't that good, oh..."", but the point of this movie is not about the plot, is it? After all, You can't capture a man's entire life in 2 hours, all you can hope is to leave an impression of it. And well, I think Fincher's aim was to do just that. To make us see what Mank may have seen or experienced which enabled him to write fucking Citizen Kane, and what the man was like. And he did a hell of a job if you ask me, thanks to Gary Oldman.

You can't fabricate stories and juicy stuff to make the plot better, it is what it is. The movie seemed really realistic to me as in not that dramatic but more realistic.

Citizen Kane has a pretty clear message about power, ambition, and innocence. What is the point of Mank? I think that's a lot harder to say. 

It works as a character study of a sad, but talented man (the monkey parable) and there's obviously a lot of affection for old Hollywood baked into this, but is it a great movie that I can recommend to anyone?

***‘Mank’ & David Fincher's films: From the Quest for Truth to a Deeper Humanity***

*There’s little doubt that David Fincher and many of the characters he’s interested in — detectives, investigative journalists, screenwriters — are concerned with the search for truth. A point repeatedly raised is how attainable truth really is. What if, asks Zodiac (2007), at the end of years of research, the truth remains, and will always remain, out of reach? What if, in The Social Network (2010), we approach the truth of the main character’s motivations by way of a variety of angles, depositions, and second-hand accounts, but leave significant gaps in that truth that linger beyond the final frame? What would be the effect on audiences? The concern with truth and with the lack of it runs through so much of the director’s work...*

geztq7q,"My review (taken from my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lyingtxyou/)):

David Fincher’s Mank is an exceptional film from a technical standpoint; the cinematography and sound design particularly standout with the film looking and sounding straight out of the 1940s (not sure about those fake cigarette burns though) and the score also being a massive highlight with Atticus and Ross’ work sounding incredibly authentic.

Fincher’s directing talent really shines in the performances with every doing a really fantastic job at playing their characters, however, they never feel like real people and that’s down to the script.

The writing and script was the weakest part of the film for me and I found myself unable to really become properly engaged with the film due to it. I feel that the filmmakers chose to focus on the least interesting part of the writing process of Citizen Kane, however, I do understand why they would focus on the fake news aspect as it’s relevant to our society today. Knowing some of the stories and history of the writing process I just couldn’t help but think how much more engaging and entertaining the film could have been and by the end of it I found myself wondering what the point of telling this particular story was.

I think part of the problem was as well that Fincher’s view of events clearly comes from “Raising Kane,” Pauline Kael’s two-part essay that asserts that Mank did all the writing and Welles came in and stole credit (which has been long-since proven to be false). This makes the ending seem like Fincher has some sort of personal vendetta against Welles and puts a dampener on the whole film as it’s clearly telling an incorrect version of events.

To summarise, from a technical filmmaking perspective, Mank is of the highest quality, but it’s version of events and the script left me with a lot to be desired.",k6zxdq

geo9f4o,"Just finished this, and I was not a fan.As someone who loves Fincher I just felt this had none of his style that makes him interesting, and the script seemed kind of flat and by the numbers until halfway through the movie (the other people in my house, all filmmakers and actors had left the room by that point). 

I found the cinematography to be competent, but very much washed out, like the high dynamic range of the monochrome red sensor was too much, and it felt grey. The sound echoed from the first line to the last for me too, it was like the whole film was re-recorded in a cement room. 

The performances were good, but I didn't really care about Mank until a story is told by a secondary character about him in the middle of the film, and then a few of the political parts later on. That monologue at the end was excellent, but it felt too little too late in my opinion. 

The actor who played Welles sounds exactly like him which is cool, but I couldn't help remembering the much better performance from the short film ""Five minutes Mr.Welles"" directed by and staring Vincent D'Onofrio as Welles incarnate. (Available on YouTube btw). 

In the end this film just doesn't feel like Fincher, it seems like it could have been directed by anyone. I mean, I understand why he did it, his father wrote the screenplay and he passed away, and it's a way to honor him. But I can't help feel like this was just not good enough of a script. 

If you want to watch a political film about a Hollywood writer, watch Trumbo, it's much much better. (In my opinion).",k6zxdq
gep89yb,"Just like this year we fount out Christopher Nolan can make a disappointing movie.... Well so can David Fincher.

With Mank it's not that the set decoration, production design, acting are anything less than fantastic - those are all wonderful and top shelf. Especially the production design which will surely win an Oscar (if there are Oscars in 2021). The problem is at the outset of the movie you wonder ""why do I care about the drunken screenwriter of a 'classic' 1941 movie? Why do I care about the writing process of this movie?"". 

And the film never really explains this. Unless you already were a big Citizen Kane fan or you knew prior to Wikipedia who Mank (the man) was..... It's pretty hard subject matter to actually give a fuck about. 

Fincher makes this beautifully designed and shot and well lit and well acted movie about old Hollywood and old titans of industry and the way genius writers were spoiled and were afforded company with the highest echelons of the studios....but the emotional resonance of the movie just isn't there because we don't *care* about Mank and his boorish behavior and his animosity against Hearst. We just don't get it. Nothing in the movie can make the 80+ year gap relatable.

If one thing is clear a movie such as this with THIS subject matter would NEVER have been funded by conventional studios concerned about theatrical releases. Netflix is the only thin that would fund a movie this expensive-looking about a subject NOBODY was asking to be made. It's good they are giving marquee directors all this money to make their pet projects (ie. Same with Roma and The Irishman). But to some extent it can lead to some self-indulgent behaviour that would have been curtailed by conventional studios (ie. The Irishman being 33 hours long and this Fincher movie because about a screenwriter 99% of people had never heard about.)",k6zxdq

Mank certainly *looks* amazing, and there are a couple great performances (shoutout to the guy who played Thalberg, who was such a great slick character).

The bad: Ending did not give me the movie high that Fincher is so good with; it's not exactly terrible, just pretty meh. Too many subplots, and not everything sticks. Story is not very engaging at times.

Final thoughts: decent movie, unconventional biopic, but falls way short of what we come to expect from Fincher. The editing and writing could've been more tight. And more importantly the ending lacked a bite, come on, this is the same guy who has some of the best endings in movie history (fight club, gone girl, social network), but this one ends on such a low with old interview montages which ruins the face paced momentum of the whole movie.",k6zxdq

It’s so full of artifice, which is rightfully placed considering it’s about show-biz and even flirts with propaganda. The movie has this like playfulness in the dialogue. It’s not at all what I expected. I cynically went into this movie thinking, “it’s just going to be Fincher jerking off to “the good old days of Hollywood”. But I really think he did a good job of not taking the time period too seriously and making an enjoyable movie. It felt similar to Hail Caesar. Although, I think Mank is better.

Also LILY COLLINS. She was fantastic. I thought she was pretty bad in the 2 things I’ve seen her in so far, so I was very impressed by her performance. Oldman did great as always.

I appreciate that great directors are being given carte blanche at Netflix to do what they want and I will continue to watch what they release prestige-wise but I hope I can connect more with those stories in the future. Anyway this one might finally bag Netflix that coveted Best Picture Oscar. 

On the flip side, Amanda Seyfried and Lily Collins were both very good. I felt like the last minute screenwriting credit drama suddenly came out of nowhere (in the context of the film). I wish the film had spent some time on the real world impact of making Kane on the careers of both Mank and Welles afterwards. I think that's really interesting and would have been relevant considering how much of the film is people trying to get Mank to drop the story because it could/will kill his career.",k6zxdq
geux69f,"I counted 76 uses of the word ""Mank"" for those playing the Title Of The Film drinking game at home. (Not counting Mankiewicz, Manky, or Mankybusiness)

What a weird movie designated for Oscar glory. It's obviously beautifully shot and scored. David Fincher being the control freak he is. The script is great. Bouncing from screwball comedy to a critique of politics and the influence people in power have seamlessly. The nonlinear narrative I think will be a deterrent for the majority of the public. Saying it's too dense or confusing. As well as being in black and white is going to turn off 85% of the Netflix audience anyways but who cares. It's not for them. This is for the film nerds.

The ones who watched Citizen Kane for homework and those who watched Citizen Kane to say you watched Citizen Kane and belittle those who haven't. As much as it's about Kane though, you don't need to see it to enjoy Mank. You might get a little more out of it but no need (But like watch Kane what are you doing). Mank is its own entity. About the people at the top who make the decisions and how Fincher is DEFINITELY still not bitter about his experience on Alien 3.

The big winner of Mank is Amanda Seyfried. Girl where were you hiding because she is mesmerizing in this. The whole cast is stellar though. From Oldman, to Lily Collins, to Tom Burke as David Fincher, I mean Orson Welles(come on though, no one else rocks that goatee).

Mank ranks near the bottom of Fincher's catalog for me during first viewing as expected since he has so many bangers. It's weird, it's beautiful. I can't wait to watch Mank again.",k6zxdq

I had been expecting a more tragic outcome for Mank and Marion's relationship, and/or some kind of final confrontation with Hearst in 1941. As it was, the sudden shift in focus to the writing credit (though I know it's quite a famous controversy) really didn't do it for me.

Also, while I loved the cinematography, I found it strange that Fincher would go to so much effort to recreate the sound and general look of films from the 30s/40s, and yet still chose to use a widescreen ratio rather than the academy standard. Not a big deal; just something that bothered me a little.",k6zxdq

Assisted by his faithful Sancho and armed with all the black magic at his command, he does just this. Destroying, in the process, not one man... but two,"" do you think that the second man referred to here, besides Sinclair, was Hearst himself? That by doing what he did, he shattered for good any possible remains of his ideals, and so irreversibly would have absolutely no way back to access other people's love, and would go on to isolate himself and decline in his castle like Kane has in Citizen Kane?

2. Is there in Citizen Kane a parallel character to Upton Sinclair, the young socialist idealist who Hearst destroys? I don't remember everything about Citizen Kane but off the top of my head I can't recall any such character, even though in Mank, that character is clearly part of the Citizen Kane picture that he's drunkenly pitching to Heasrt and his guests at the dinner party and which he would go on to write.",k6zxdq

geoex29,"I loved this as a biopic in the same way that I loved Danny Boyle’s Steve Jobs film - I don’t get the sense that it was very accurate to the actual people and events, but I really, really love the story it tells anyway.

Despite the impression you might get that the film would be about Mank, Hearst and Welles, I found that Louis B. Mayer was by far the biggest target of its ire. It’s not really a film about the writing of Citizen Kane (the film basically just tells us that Mank sat in his bed for 2 months and drank lots of booze and at some point cranked out a masterpiece (a dubious representation perhaps)). Instead it’s an interesting reflection on the 1930s that draws parallels between their political landscape and ours.

Unfortunately this means that it’s ending which addresses Citizen Kane’s (in)famous authorship dispute feels out of place and hasty. Suddenly Welles and Mank are at each other’s throats about the writing credit and then it’s just over. However I didn’t find that that was bad enough to sour my love of the prior 2 hours.

Not as big a Gary Oldman fan as lots of people, but this movie showed me how brilliant he is. No fat suit, no violence, just pure acting and it was magnificent. I’ve always loved Amanda Seyfried and here she truly played a role she was meant to.

Before this, I had knew who Arliss Howard was, but I had no impression of him, but he was fucking brilliant in this movie as Louis B. Mayer.

I think it's a well constructed movie overall. That is to say, thematically I thought the flashbacks provided a great insight to the character of Mank and deepened the story. However, it bothered me a little bit that all the flashbacks are prefaced with a description of where and when they take place, in screenplay format no less. This could seem like a cutsie reference to the subject matter of the movie, but one doesn't need to think about it long to realize that if those headings weren't there, the movie wouldn't make any sense, as the flashbacks themselves jump forward and backward in time. Compared to say, Citizen Kane for instance, a notable crutch.

geoe3hh,"Being a fan of classic Hollywood and David Fincher, Mank was my one of my most anticipated films and it did not disappoint. I really liked it. 

Like everyone else the cinematography, editing, music, set, and costume design were amazing. Erik Messerschmidt did an excellent job creating beautiful images that, while invoked classic Hollywood films, were modern. Reznor’s and Ross’ score was amazing. It sounded almost nothing like their previous work, which in this context was a good thing. 

The acting was very good. Oldman did a good job with Mank. He could have made Mank a complete buffoon or cynical to point of annoyance, but played Mank as a real person. He displayed the good and the bad in him. It might not be the most accurate representation of Mank’s politics; people described him as isolationist as Lindbergh, but the script needed something to motivate Mank’s decision to write about Hearst. Seyfried was great as Davies. She and Oldman had great chemistry. Arliss Howard stole most of the scenes he was in. I liked how at first he came across as your regular Hollywood studio head asshole but evolved into something much more sinister. Collins (Rita Alexander) and Troughton (John Houseman) were the weakest links for me. I understood that they were there mostly to move the plot further, but a little bit could have been added to their characters. The thing with Alexander’s husband becoming MIA and not being raised about again was a bit strange.

The writing was very good and had more humor than most of Fincher’s other films. While I can see how some can view the dialogue as a bit too much Hudsucker Proxy, it’s important to remember that is how some people spoke back then. Also who doesn’t love 1930’s style banter and one liners? You didn’t need to know too much about classic Hollywood or Citizen Kane, but it helped. I found myself being a bit like that DiCaprio meme from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. There’s Chaplin! There’s Norma Shearer! It doesn’t take away from the film if you don’t get it the first time around, but if you do get into the myths of old Hollywood, it’s pretty fun.

Oddly, besides The Curious Case of Benjamin Button this is also one of Fincher’s “warmest” and heartfelt film. I have to admit that the ending got to me a bit. Fincher’s known for making dark, cold films (Seven, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) or they have cynical, pitch black humor (Fight Club, The Social Network), so it’s nice to see something that is more heartfelt and sentimental. It’s still a look at cynical workings of Hollywood, but it stands for something and does, like Mank, eventually shows the emotions it’s been hiding up it’s sleeve.",k6zxdq

The exercise in technical aspects was pointless by filming this in ultra HD -- the sound was very distracting at first -- sorry, but no old movie sounds like it was recorded in a hollow tree trunk. And what was up with all the blatantly BAD CGI for fire and water? Both the hardest things to do, but these stuck out like a sore thumb. The worst aspect of the film is the screenplay -- it's dull and just a collection of moments. There is hardly any narrative to follow. It's not until maybe an hour in that things actually start to follow each other.

Panic Room now looks like a masterpiece in comparison. This is easily my least favorite Fincher film and I considered him in my top 3 of all time. All this wait and toying around with TV after Gone Girl just to get this? I wouldn't even nominate this for any art awards, yet people are saying it's a shoe-in for even Picture and while that's not shocking because it seems like the snobbery type thing Hollywood is into, I have to say even 2020 there are objectively 10-20 way better movies, and one of them will be sorely snubbed for this pretentious snore.

Second viewing made things a lot clearer and we watched it in 1080p instead of Dolby Vision which let me appreciate the cinematography a bit more (DV looks like shit on my TV unfortunately).

Also, If I'm a premiere director going forward and Netflix is giving me as much money as I want to make a movie, I'm using $5k of that to pay someone to actually sit down and subtitle the movie instead of whatever weird algorithm they use to caption their movies. Lots of little details lost in the subtitles. I'm not a guy who normally uses them but I remember seeing someone on twitter point this same thing out when watching THE IRISHMAN last year.

genyu0m,"I thought it was a technically brilliant exercise in old filmmaking techniques and styles, not dissimilar to Todd Haynes' Far from Heaven. Erik Messerschmidt is definitely the frontrunner for Best Cinematography. The screenplay is written with a careful and loving ear for the old Hollywood style of wit; the structure was a bit frustrating at times but toward the end of the film when it all came together I was satisfied with how it unfolded. The performances, with the exception of Arliss Howard, aren't particularly flashy. Oldman is great as usual, but he's more subdued than he has been in the past (which isn't a bad thing). The one who stood out the most to me was Amanda Seyfried, who I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from. Her character is a quiet standout, and she gives a very good performance within the context of the movie. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a fun, period-appropriate homage to film scores of the time, even if it's not as pronounced or creative a work as The Social Network or Watchmen (I'm looking forward to their Soul score later this month). On the whole, I don't think it's Fincher's best but it's certainly one of the best movies I've seen this year (providing we're speaking solely about films released in 2020).

Admittedly I struggle though with a lot of movies made before like 1949...though I did recently watch Citizen Kane in prep for this and thought it lived up the hype and was indeed a revolutionary film, something I couldn't say about Sargent York, which I tried watching recently also and found incredibly hokey and boring and made it about 30 minutes into that also.

It brings a very interesting point of view to the whole Kane Hearst debacle, and away from Orson Welles' larger than life point of view, which is dramatically refreshing and brave, this film doesn't scream ""genius genius"" at Orson Welles at all, a good move. It brings in a human side of the story and sheds some light as of why Kane WAS indeed Hearst, and his past connection with Mank, which I hope was not entirely fictionalized for this film.

Loved the cinematography, cigarette burns and all. The editing is pure golden hollywood, and the performances great.

The second act, though, drags. A lot. And I mean a LOT. You could have cut 30 minutes and still made your point go through. The writing is also subpart through the half point. It picks up the pace and quality as it comes to it's tragic conclusion.

I've seen Citizen Kane (and loved it obviously) and had a vague knowledge of the behind the scenes stuff about it but not enough, so a lot of the time I was tempted to check my phone to figure out who was who and what they did. One of the things about Old Hollywood is that everyone involved had some incredible life full of drama, so it's easy to get lost in that. This was especially hard with Mank himself because I had literally no knowledge of the guy prior to this. I think one thing that may help is to now read more about the era, Mank, Hearst, Mayer, Welles etc to get a broader understanding, then I'll be able to take the film in a bit more.

I adored the cinematography and performances too. Amanda Seyfried was so good, and the scene at the dinner party where Mank essentially pitches Citizen Kane to the person it's based on is incredible.

Like any other fan of fincher I was waiting 6 years to watch his new movie and I found myself bored about it.

My biggest problem is that this movie seems written only for those who have a depth knowledge of what hollywood was about during 1930's. If you don't know well the main characters of that golden era of american cinema and the historical context you'll not understand shit about the real meaning of the story.

It's maddening because as usual the movie is well directed and acting is  suberb, that's your usual Fincher, too bad a normal spectator will not understand half of all the conversations and the references he'll hear for a good part of the movie.

The acting is top notch, and cinematography is gorgeous, as usual for a Fincher film.

geypmrh,I thought this was a great movie and I loved that it was in the style of old Hollywood. Some people had a problem with the cinematography but if you've seen any movies from that time period its matches up extremely well. The script was great and extremely witty. I forsee this winning best original screenplay as did Citizen Kane which is quite fitting. Gary Oldman as usual gives an amazing Oscar worthy performance.  On the critical side unlike most on this thread I thought Amanda Seyfried's performance was pretty bad and wooden and this is coming from someone who usually likes her work. Overall I thought it was a great edition to the Fincher oeuvre and would give it 9 out of 10 stars!,k6zxdq
geobpdj,"In a shocking twist that no one saw coming, David Fincher has made one of the best movies of the year.

I’m still stewing on Mank, and probably will need a second viewing to feel like I’ve really soaked it all up, but my initial impression is that it’s fucking great. I read that Fincher’s goal was for Mank to feel like it could have been sitting on the same shelf in an RKO vault as Citizen Kane and was only just now unearthed, and with the exception of a few F-bombs, I think it met that goal brilliantly. The dry wit of the character Mank, Marion Davies, and the rest of the supporting cast places it perfectly in the aesthetic of old Hollywood. Not to mention Fincher’s keen use of camera movements, editing choices, and visual flourishes that make it seem fully plausible that it could have been made 80 years ago. The one place the 1940s aesthetic was broken, and which was clearly done intentionally, was with the type-written title cards. Although it was uncharacteristic for films from the golden age of Hollywood to be overtly meta, it does tie Mank in nicely with the rest of Fincher’s filmography which almost always operates on a level of self-awareness and irony. 

As much as I could go on about the directing, aesthetic, and story, the acting was what really brought Mank home for me. Oldman is at his best here and Seyfried has hit a new career high. If I, like Mank, were a betting man, I’d wager that they both will have Oscar nominations come 2021. The rest of the cast is also equally good and all contributed to the wondrous illusion that is great cinema.

Finally, I would like to add that as politically relevant as Mank seems, keep in mind that Jack Fincher wrote the script more than 20 years ago so if anything, it’s a reminder that history repeats itself.",k6zxdq
geou6bf,I’m only 10 minutes in but wanted to comment on how much I love the sound mix of the dialogue already. It’s got that same slightly distorted quality you find on movies from that era like you’re listening to decades old phonograph record.,k6zxdq
gep6nso,"I expected this movie to be staunchly anti-Welles after both Fincher's comments and the general discourse I've seen on Twitter, but I was surprised at how it really makes Welles look like the only other person who believed in the project and wanted to take down Hearst and co.

I mean, he gives Mank screen credit immediately at the end (as well as sharing his own director on-screen credit with his cinematographer, historically). I don't think that *Mank* goes out of its way to say Welles had nothing to do with *Kane* at all, like I half expected it to. If anything it just says Mankiewicz deserves some credit in history for Kane's production, even if Orson rewrote the script and made it what it was.

And it's easy, for me, to see why. Jack Fincher gets sole credit on this film despite both David and Eric Roth doing script rewrites. Much like Mank just wanted to be remembered through Kane, his ""greatest work,"" David Fincher wants his father to be remembered through *Mank*.

I wasn't expecting it to be as personal of a film as it was and I'm all for it.",k6zxdq

geo9vt5,"A stylish and beautifully looking old-school classic movie, Mank throws you back into the old days of Hollywood and stays interesting through the drama and learning more about the guy and the people and events he encounters through the different times and settings. It may sound like a slow drama and perhaps it still won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for me personally the film's running time was never an issue and it zipped by nicely. Fincher is usually good with pacing stuff in most of his films.

There's always the question on my mind whether Mank would still work for someone having never seen Citizen Kane. I'd say yes, although catching some of the little nods throughout the film and the people related to it might help make things more coherent I suppose. Maybe a re-watch would help connect the dots better. I don't doubt some of the film's scenes were probably fictional, but that's fine in my books if the story and character stuff is consistent. The music and use of sound is very good, all the performances are great. It's definitely got that Oscar Buzz appeal to it, so I suspect it might get some big award nominations. Just goes to show Netflix can deliver great films, and Mank is definitely up there for me. 8/10",k6zxdq

Amanda Seyfried was the best of the supporting actors with her scene fusing Mank being particularly poignant. Could have used more of Dance but the organ grinders monkey was definitely a highlight.

Fincher is definitely someone who can make absolutely anything interesting. It seems the common thread in a lot of his films (especially the ones that aren't story driven) is that he knows how to humanize the subject by focusing on the people behind it. It's not just a movie about Facebook or the writing of Citizen Kane or catching the Zodiac Killer. It's a movie about Mark Zuckerberg, Herman Mankiewicz or Robert Graysmith. They become the driving force. Their passion, obsession, and struggles. On top of that, he's one of the most visually interesting storytellers there is.  

I think a lot of more casual fans might be put off the idea of the film, just on the basis of being a black and white period piece about the making of Citizen Kane.

Gary Oldman gave one of this best performances in here and Amanda Seyfried is pretty good too. The film is technically solid with it's stunning black and white cinematography, a moody and evocative score. Not the strongest of Fincher films but any ardent fan wouldn't want to look away",k6zxdq

geob93t,"**Why I’ll Be Going Back to the Cinema on November 25th**

We’re currently in a global pandemic and it might seem a bit dangerous to go out and sit in these theatres for a leisurely experience watching cinema at the cinema. However, there is a very important film coming out on November 25th. No, it is not Mank. Before I explain what film it is and why it’s that film, (Although it should be obvious.) I feel I need to explain why **I will not be seeing David Fincher’s new film, Mank.**

I have two major reasons as to why I will not be seeing Mank and I think a large number of people will agree with my reasons. (Although I’ll probably catch some flack from SJWs on one of the points.) The first being, it’s a remake of Citizen Kane, one of the first movies. An absolute classic. I haven’t seen it (yet) but it’s just one of those films you can’t touch. I don’t know why Fincher thinks he can mess with such a masterpiece so nonchalantly. Not to mention, his recent track record has not been great. He created one of the best on-screen portrayals of pure badassery with Tyler Durden in Fight Club but then you look at a film like Gone Girl (Spoilers for Gone Girl) and you see a man who gets dominated by a woman. (What a cuck.) This brings me to my second point. Mank is pure SJW propaganda. In the vein of films like Ghostbusters (2016) and Charlie’s Angels (2019) (This one is especially pathetic because it’s still called CHARLIE even though they’re all women.), it is yet another Hollywood remake of a film where they replace the stars of the film with women. How could Lily Collins or Amanda Seyfried live up to the magic that Orson Welles brought to the screen in Citizen Kane? The answer is, they can’t. Not to mention the casting of Gary Oldman, who is no doubt a great actor, but this is a quintessentially American film and a British actor just won’t cut it. Why couldn’t they cast a real actor like Joaquin Phoenix or Kevin Spacey? I think I’ve properly justified why Mank is just pointless and not worth seeing.

Now, the film that I AM going to the cinema to watch is one that is going to be heralded as the most important of the year and possibly even the decade. (I hesitate with calling it the most important of the year for a reason I’ll explain later.) That film is The Croods: A New Age, which is otherwise known as Croods 2. (I’ll be calling it that from here on out for the sake of brevity.) To properly explain why Croods 2 is essential viewing for not just appreciators of cinema but for everyone I need to go back to 2013. The year The Croods came out. The Croods is truly one of the most brilliant pieces of filmmaking of not just the 2010s but of all time. To explain why The Croods was so impactful on the world of cinema I think we need to go even further back to 1994. That was the year a movie (Yes, a movie, because it is so obviously not cinema.) called Pulp Fiction released. This year is also known to film historians as “The Year Cinema Died.” I, for one, very much agree with this branding. If you look at the landscape of film at this time you’d been hit by classic after classic. Citizen Kane (the first real film), Fight Club, and other movies I cannot remember at this moment. Then 1994 hits and changes everything. You get hit with dud after dud after dud. Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, Kill Bill, Taxi Driver (Joker rip-off), Reservoir Dogs, and many many more. It goes on like this for nearly 20 years, that’s almost two decades with zero good films. Then DreamWorks decides, hey, we’re gonna make a film that changes the way people see film. We’re gonna make this industry better than it ever was before. That film was 2013’s The Croods.

The Croods is brilliant in more ways than I can even comprehend. Let’s start with the themes. Never has there been a more thematically rich film than The Croods. There are so many layers that I don’t think anyone can even get to the center. It’s like a circular hedge maze with endless layers. I’m convinced there isn’t even a center to get to. I mean, just a few layers in there are themes of dominance, the struggle between man and nature, and what I think is the most important of the film, the dueling ideologies of staying in the past or looking towards the future. This film is quite meta in a way because a lot of it thematically is about looking towards a brighter future and this film created a brighter future for film. They could’ve sat back and made a film in the Foot Fetish Era. Something that doesn’t push boundaries, something that fits in or conforms to the norms. But that’s not what they did. They decided something needed to be done and they would be the ones to do it. Now, you might think this is some pretentious art film that no one could really enjoy from my explanation. But what makes The Croods even more brilliant is that everyone can enjoy it. On just the surface level it tells such a gripping and expansive narrative, with such captivating characters. You feel every emotion the film presents, you feel the large scale at every moment. So, even stupid people and children can go in and see this film as wonderful. (Even if they could never fully appreciate its glory like me.)

Without The Croods we wouldn’t have Drive or Joker or Avengers: Infinity War. Hell, even big-name auteurs like Christopher Nolan cite The Croods as a major influence on not just their films, but on their decisions to become filmmakers. So, I feel I’ve explained at length why this film is so important not just to me, but to everyone. Now, this year is 2020, we are getting the return of this franchise to the big screen. Its glorious reintroduction to the world. From the looks of it, it seems like this film could be a bigger triumph than the first film. This may seem like blasphemy but look at the state Hollywood is in. We’re getting SJW remakes of classic films one after the other (Like Mank.) and no one is stopping them. Last time film had been in a decline like this (1994) who came to fix it? That’s right, the Croods, and now they have come to reclaim the throne and set Hollywood back in the right direction. A lot of people will say, “Well it’s just some dumb kids movie.” But they’re the ones who are dumb. They don’t see the influence this film will have not only on the regular citizens of the United States but on the future artists of the world. Bong Joon-ho, director of the first foreign film Parasite, said in his speech at the Oscars last year that if more people saw The Croods for what it was maybe there would be a second Korean film. I want a world where I can see two Korean films. I want to see a world where the Croods live on forever.

AUTHORS NOTE: The reason I struggled to say that this film would be the most important of the decade is that if you look at the release schedule of this film series you see a pattern of a new release every 7 years. This means we could be looking at a Croods 3 in 2027. I don’t want to make any pre-judgments about that film’s impact so I am refraining (for now) from calling Croods 2 the most important film of the decade.",k6zxdq

But outside of the themes of the powerful shaping reality/""fake news"" (elegantly explained by Mank as working because of ""people in the dark who've checked their disbelief at the door""), Mank was a film about a guy who wanted to be more than a court jester (note that the literal last lines are something like, ""you're always making jokes"" | ""Only when it's serious."")",k6zxdq

It's another ""Only Netflix would make it"" movie, and that meant non-negotiable digital. Fincher isn't a stranger to digital, but might not have made that decision otherwise.

There is no crescendo, things happen and pile up on people and they respond in kind but everything keeps moving forward. 

On the point of Mank's relationship with Marion and Hearst, I think the cliquey closeness was intentional. They knew people who knew each other and Hearst liked the way Mank spoke so he was invited places but had moral reservations and made a fool of himself due to alcoholism. 

I believe the drama of the film is centered around finding out what happened to Mank that ostracized him from Hollywood, and it was his alcoholism and an outburst that went too far.",k6zxdq

That version seemed like it would have been fun and exciting, but this movie left me bored and a wanting. 

It’s fine that Fincher went in a different direction than I expected, but it just didn’t work for me. It wasn’t compelling, interesting, eye opening or anything. And it wasn’t tightly woven like I expect from a Fincher film. I love David Fincher’s films. But this had tons of hammy exposition meeting all the people, introduction after introduction, where supers of their names and titles would have worked great, especially since he was already using scene headers as transitions for the flashbacks. And there were so many scenes that not only shouldn’t have been there to begin with, but they just went on and on. 

It was like Fincher wanted to tell too many different stories all at once —Sinclair, Mayer, Hearst, Mank, Thalberg, WGA, Election corruption, etc. and so he just pasted them all onto this story framework of the writing of Citizen Kane and then left out the part about the writing of Citizen Kane.",k6zxdq

I didn't really pay attention to the frequency of the marks, but they seemed pretty correct (every \~22 min). The reel switch was also mostly between scenes, although the reel length didn't really affect the act structure of the film, like it often did back then. I also really geeked out about the first simulated projector switch being slightly wonky and the noise around one of the later cue marks. The last few seconds of a film reel tend to have significantly more scratches and specks, since this is the part of the film reel, which is handled the most, when the film is being prepared for the projection (e.g. spooled onto the projector spools) and also because the spool rotates the fastest at the end of the reel.

gepkn0e,"Actually no not really, if you're talking about the authorship of Citizen Kane. The movie shows Mank writing a lengthy, novelistic first draft of Citizen Kane, which he did do. He also fought a bit with Welles to get credit, going against a prior agreement between the two. What the movie doesn't show but does suggest is what happened after he handed the draft off to Welles. Both men worked on many more drafts in an attempt to transform the script into something cinematic (and much much shorter, of course). Essentially the movie is one-sided but not really inaccurate in this regard. 

If you're talking about the flashbacks then the bones of all that are true also. Mank was for a time part of Hearst's inner circle, and his relationship with the tycoon and Marion Davies almost certainly inspired the characters of Kane and Susan Alexander from Citizen Kane. Hearst also worked with MGM to produce propaganda films to crush Upton Sinclair's socialist campaign for California governor in 1934.",k6zxdq

geptaly,"I'm really curious how the positive/negative reactions to MANK break down in terms of people's connection to the era (i.e. ""do you nerd out about Old Hollywood?""). Like, going in, I saw people say ""You should see CITIZEN KANE first, so you get the references"". But most of that is stylistic... the actual *meat* of the movie is about Hollywood in the 30s, not Kane. 

So to me, this is the definition of a niche movie. If you just don't care about Hollywood in the 30s, it feels like it will be stylish, slick, with smart dialogue and good performances, but rather light on plot and substance. But if you go in and are already interested in the figures of Mayer, Thalberg, the studios, and the drama of the time... it's much more rich. 

Obviously I'm sure there are people who love this who don't care at all for Old Hollywood, and those who hate it who do. But I feel like that might be the most important divisor in people's reaction to the movie. So much of the substance of this movie is rooted in the specifics of Hollywood in the 30s... I'm at least vaguely interested in that stuff, so I knew the basic dynamics of Mayer/Thalberg/the studios, and even so, there were plenty of small parts that totally lost me. But you kinda need at least a basic grounding in that 30s Hollywood context for the dialogue to have any weight to it (and not just be a bunch of fluffy zingers). 

Or, to make the example concrete: Mayer and Thalberg are critical to the plot of this movie (which I certainly didn't expect!), but they aren't exactly explained in detail. If the only context you have for them is what you see on screen, I think it's all going to feel a little ""light"". They're just two studio executive stereotypes. But if you bring in outside context, and are interested in their role in Hollywood history, then the witty banter packs a lot more punch. It's the difference between them being props used in Mank's own plot, and them being actually significant in their own right. (For what it's worth, from the little I know about the era, Fincher is somewhat amusingly unfair to Thalberg in showing him as a lackey glued to Mayer's side... Thalberg was famously a maverick, and the two often clashed!).

I'm just kinda baffled & impressed by the move by Netflix. This is a dense, fairly niche B&W flick that seems largely focused on film nerds... like I'm very grateful, but wild that they put so much into a movie whose appeal just can't be *that* wide.

Anyways, for people I know, that's the disclaimer I'd put on MANK. I'd certainly skip it if you haven't seen KANE (I mean, just watch KANE instead, they have lots in common but the original obviously does it better), but honestly I'm not sure I'd recommend it unless you find Old Hollywood interesting. Because in abstract, without that grounding, there's just not enough ""there"" to justify a 2+ hour movie.",k6zxdq

First 30 minutes slow my ass, first 30 minutes are hectic if you're in the game being played here, then it gets into a more reasonable pace, not faster, but slower while it builds up.

I didn't know Fincher had this in him, really. Certainly not after Gone Girl for instance.

(Wow the actual ""Man on the street"" newsreel from the Sinclair election is on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkIq9eIIAq4 )

I thought the Black and White and lack of fancy CGI camerawork made Fincher focus in hard on lighting, framing, and editing.  The editing especially seemed like a masterclass to my little brain.

Also since I saw it I've moved to LA and learned more about the film industry and been to Hearst Castle... So... More context!",k6zxdq
gg26jck,"The scene that sums up what is wrong with the movie is where Mank introduces to this other character a whole buch of writers/executives or whatever job they do, and the directing and editing points out that this men are important, relevant to the story, cinema legends we should recognize and get excited for but must people will not. So it falls flat. 

Assuming that we remember citizen Kane, that we know, care or admire this Mank character, that we are well informed about 30s Hollywood politics/propaganda, or that citizen Kane is embed on our minds and we are so aware of its importance and so on is the big mistake of this movie; I like when you have to decipher things for your own, but this movie assumes WE ALL care already for what’s going on on the screen when we don’t, and the movie doesn’t make the slightest effort to do so.",k6zxdq

Succumbing to the idea his following films never caught the success of Kane.

I believe he was always great and those guys saw it too.",k6zxdq

His second excellent film (Magnificent Ambersons) onward was butchered by the studios. Welles certainly suffered from ego driven hubris but to me he is one of the most tragic cinematic cases of the 20th century. An absolute tragedy he was never given that much creative freedom again or final cut of his films.",k6zxdq
gernaa5,"Eh I think Fincher was overanalzying - Welles was a shittalker his whole life. Being ultra literal about his boasts is kind of silly.

If you asked Welles about it point blank he'd probably tell you he was joking or lying. Welles loved to be purposefully contradictory.",k6zxdq
gezbuas,"Fincher is channeling Kael very hard here,more than the one scene from I'm Thinking of Ending Things. The central lie at the heart of Kael's hatchet job is that Orson imploded after Kane and even Kane only works cause of everyone excpet for Kane. 

The truth is that Orson's career was ruined by the studio system from Kane onwards and especially with tje superior Maginificent Ambersands. The whole ""Welles is too much if a big shot who flamed out"" is debunked by the mete existence of his ither great films such as Touch of Evil,F For Fake,Chimes At Midnight and Other Sude of the Wind - all of which show that Orson improved and pushed himself further as much as he could and more importantly that he was flexible enough to work with different crews,genres,styles and even different industries. Whether or not the studio fucked him over is easily proven by comparing the studio cut of Touch of Evil vs the director's cut.

Not sure if David is parroting very obviously diengenouous and debunked crop just to be edgy and reactionary or he's drunk way too much of the Kael kool-aid. Its even.weirder knowing that Fincher knows a thing or two about studio fuckery ala Alien 3.

Citien Kane while great isn't even his best film,F For Fake and Touch of Evil are so much better. Hopefully we are blessed to get the true version of Ambersands someday.

Maybe we should really praise Darius Kanji,Trent Reznor,Cronanwith,Sorkin and Angus Wall for Fincher's success amd blame Fincher for Alien 3 instead. Fincher's just a big phony surrounded by a cult of fanboys just like mean old Mr Orson Welles.

Welles also made a note to put Mankiewicz’s writing credit above his own, as well as giving credit to Mank in interviews for the film’s rosebud structure, much of the plot, and just being a funny guy to be around with. But a lot of Citizen Kane WAS written by Welles.

First, Fincher has stated in interviews that Fincher himself and Roth did rewrites to Fincher’s father, Jack’s, original script because it was too much of an attribution battle and Fincher said he was not interested in a two hour attribution battle. So, I don’t see a reason why he would lie while promoting his movie but if he is lying and he “trojan horsed” it in there at the end as you claim then it’s a truly, poorly constructed story of an attribution battle and considering one of Fincher’s masterpieces, The Social Network, has at its core, a battle over an idea we know he could make that type of story riveting. So either one of the most exacting, fastidious filmmakers we have is lying to the media and suddenly forgot how to construct a story or Mank isn’t actually a story of an attribution battle, which leads me to my next point...

Fincher himself benefits from being regarded as an auteur, a master of his craft, obsessively involved in nearly every detail of his films. A reputation he shares with Welles, so I find this idea that Fincher woke up one day and decided to attempt to ruin the reputation of Orson Welles completely ridiculous. 

I maintain, even if this movie is secretly about authorship, Welles is the natural antagonist for that story and his character is barely in the movie, he may have less screen time than the Frieda character. 

>	The whole idea of “Mank’s talent was being mined by others” is literally the Kael theory just replacing Welles with Meyer/Hearst

What I meant by his talent being mined is his renown wit, fierce social criticism, and his insight by the power brokers around him. In the scene with Irving Thalberg, Mank astutely disparages the execs for being able to produce movies that suspend the audience’s disbelief but somehow cannot smear a political opponent. Mank’s casual insult sparks the idea for the use of propaganda films against Sinclair which sets the path to his friend’s suicide. Hence Mank’s guilt, which I referred to. And as for Hearst, he makes it quite clear to Mank that Mank is the monkey in the parable and he’s only inviting him to those dinner parties because he thinks Mank is funny and likes the way he talks. Not of that has anything to do with Kael’s theory or Mank’s stories being stolen.

Honestly, watch the movie again with the themes of guilt, moral responsibility, and power in your head and see how you interpret it after a second viewing. Unless you’re a giant fan of Louis Mayer, I don’t see how you could be upset at the “villains” of this story. It is quite clearly a takedown of Hollywood power brokers and the studio system of old Hollywood being a strong obstacle to creative expression. I mean, that’s another thing Fincher and Welles have in common, they both fought for creative control over their early projects. If anything, this movie is proposing it’s a miracle Citizen Kane got made at all given the pressures against it. 

Rather than Fincher lazily shoehorning in a controversial theory at the end of his movie it’s much more likely he gave the “authorship debate” the proportion it deserved which is to say a petty squabble that amounts to a couple of minutes of screen time before they share the Oscar victory as they did in real life.",k6zxdq
geukmkt,">	what’s happening in the final dinner scene

Another key scene in my opinion. My interpretation of that scene starts with the obvious as Mank drunkenly lays out what is essentially an outline of Citizen Kane. Also, Mayer’s retort to Mank is basically a less eloquent version of what Hearst says to Mank as he escorts Mank out at the end of the sequence—which is the reveal of the organ grinder’s monkey parable and the climax of the movie, in my opinion. Mank brought up the parable earlier in the movie but what is later chronologically—which shows this moment with Hearst truly stuck with Mank—and Mank does not recite the parable. But here, Hearst recites the parable to Mank, almost in a friendly way (Charles Dance is exceptional here as he always is) with his hand on Mank’s back as Mank realizes he is the monkey and the monkey’s perception of power dynamics is completely off—all of this is happening during the early days of the Guilds and Hollywood workers trying organize while they are getting screwed as the scene with Mayer announcing wage cuts shows.

Now, during the dinner itself before Hearst escorts Mank out and before Mank’s drunken outburst when Mank first shows up the power dynamics are already at play as Mank shows up not in the proper attire for the party which Mayer mocks him for, Mank jabs at them by saying they don’t know what a vacuum cleaner is, and then right as Mank is about to sit down in a seat of his choosing at the table and close to Marion Hearst tells the servant to sit Mank down at the end of the table, away from the power brokers and the main conversation, and as Mank is walking away Mayer calls Mank, “Mr. Monkeywitz” furthering the point that Mank is the monkey, he is there simply because Hearst thinks he’s funny, he’s a jester. And when the monkey’s performance isn’t good, isn’t funny to Hearst Hearst sees him out which Hearst does after reciting the parable and eloquently informing Mank the monkey does the bidding of the people who are actually in charge and says goodbye to Mank for the evening. Note to, Hearst does not react angrily or say Mank is kicked out for good or that he cannot come back, just that Mank has had “too much to drink”, Mank’s performance wasn’t good tonight. 

As to why Marion is crying, I believe she starts tearing up when Mank is telling the story of Hearst—or Kane to us, the knowing audience—and he refers to her as simply the “love interest” in Hearst’s story and how she is beneath Hearst’s social status. She cares for Mank and I think she is hurt by his comments but when Mank first shows up at the dinner she is already upset or embarrassed by his behavior and is sneaking drinks herself. I think she feels fraudulent on some level. 

Another great line in that scene is when Mank vomits and the other guests at the dinner party gasp and Mank says something close to, “at least the white wine came up with the fish”, which like his vacuum cleaner jab earlier is insulting their status. Like, this what you rich people with servants care about: proper wine pairings. But that’s it, that’s the point, it’s just another great line from Mank. Mank, the clever wordsmith with his well timed witticisms and verbal jabs, what of note has he accomplished in Hollywood? Mank, the clever East Coast writer comes to Hollywood—where according to him the only competition is idiots—and what does he do? Drinks and gambles his days away in writers’ rooms and plays the performing monkey for the power brokers of Hollywood at night. But the combination of Mank seeing what is being done to Sinclair, his friend’s coaxed selling out and consequential suicide, and Mank being slapped with his own social standing by the power brokers provide the motivation for him to finally put his creativity to use to produce something great, not just great but something that many will regard as the gold standard. And that’s why he wants a screen credit at the end, to show everyone that the monkey did something great and he did it while sticking it to the power brokers.",k6zxdq

The ideas, the principles, and the conflict was the entire socialism part. How Mank is the only voice for socialism in a world where it should be popular but it isn't, refuses to give in, the moral dilemma of cinema & the rich manipulating the simple people's political views, the director of the anti-socialism movie killing himself. Upton Sinclair losing because of the movie, Mank kamikazeing career insulting William Hearst while basically outlining Citizen Kane. This movie is filled with great scenes worthy of rewatching many times.

I really liked the subtle sort of madness Gary Oldman brings to that character, one of my favorite scenes is where he begs Marion Davies to ask the guy to pull the movie, but she says she can't do that because that was ""her exit"" and then Mank just shuts up and walks away laughing maniacally, holy shit I will never forget that laugh.

Or the black and white version of Fury Road.

gf2xog6,"Yeah, one of the initial scenes inside, I was like ""hm, maybe it'll change outside."" Then it didn't. I even checked my sound system to see if I accidentally changed a setting lol

Structurally, the screenplay was fine. It was the very loose narrative and overall arc for characters that was incredibly weak. Oldman mostly just had to bumble onto the set and leave most days, it seems. There are maybe two standout scenes, but other than that, I don't think he deserves a nom. While there are a fair amount of movies with essentially no plot and arcs you have to dig into (Boyhood comes to mind instantly), those movies at least resonate. This movie feels like it alienates.

I actually watched the movie with subtitles on, so I caught all the dialogue. It just seemed very forced and stylized, which is obviously the point, but just didn't seem like a necessary flourish. Like the film's technical aspects, it just didn't seem to all gel together on screen. If the movie was more... zappy (???) then it would've worked. Not like Scott Pilgrim or anything, but just more alive.

The CGI that instantly comes to mind is when Seyfried kicks up water when she's on the fountain. I watched the trailer after viewing the film and it's in there and looks the same, if you want to find it real quick. Just seems like an unnecessary CGI'd moment.",k6zxdq

""Ren Klyce, who is the sound designer, and I started talking years ago about how we wanted to make this feel like it was found in the UCLA archives — or in Martin Scorsese’s basement on its way to restoration. Everything has been compressed and made to sound like the 1940s. The music has been recorded with older microphones so it has a sort of sizzle and wheeze around the edges — you get it from strings, but you mostly get it from brass. What you’re hearing is a revival house — an old theater playing a movie.""

According to Fincher, viewers have noted how the sound of the movie, which recalls the warm sound of movies from the '30s and '40s, impacts the Mank viewing experience: ""It’s funny because I’ve played it for some people who ask, ‘What is going on with the sound?

But to do it in a way that is reckless with history is a bad move.",k6zxdq
gerz1r9,"I'd say not quite, because while the part of Raising Kane that says Welles did no writing isn't true, it's pretty public knowledge that Welles and the studio did not want to credit Mank, because he had to sue with the WGA to get his credit in the final product, so that's true. The movie doesn't really go with the Raising Kane story; it shows Mank working on a long draft of the script which Welles edits down and changes after the movie is over, so I'm not sure where the inaccuracies with it really are.",k6zxdq

geq8fq5,"Actually, Welles’ claim that he wrote his own independent draft has not been able to be corroborated by anyone. Mank’s Pauline Kael-inspired stuff was most excised from the first draft by David Fincher and Eric Roth.

So yeah, this movie is still not terribly accurate but I think it’s still well within the lines of artistic license.",k6zxdq
geps10t,"I think we're pretty much saying the same thing lol. The movie isn't inaccurate in its depiction of the writing of Kane, it just stops after the first draft is written, and tells a version of history that is one sided.

gf0t3qx,">Fincher woke up one day and decided to attempt to ruin the reputation of Orson Welles completely ridiculous.

Fincher has recently made comments that adhere strictly to the Kael theory that Welles was a one-hit wonder and his failures prove he was no auteur. A movie can be a takedown of Hollywood and a takedown of Welles cause they represent very different institutions or causes abd the movoe does spend less time on the Welles stuff but it does go there. Maybe Fincher cut it down to 1/2 scwnes but its not gone. Everything else you say is true but it does not refute the point that its clearly pro-Kael either cause they are different targets. Hence,its a Trojan Horse and not full blown propaganda like Jack Fincher's original draft seems to be.




>think Orson Welles’ tragedy lies in the mix between monumental talent and filthy immaturity. Sure, there is genius in Citizen Kane, who could argue? But when Welles says, ‘It only takes an afternoon to learn everything there is to know about cinematography,’ pfff… Let’s say that this is the remark of someone who has been lucky to have Gregg Toland around him to prepare the next shot… Gregg Toland, damn it, an insane genius

Now I know he's being cheeky and a bit of a troll but this is textbook pro-Kael. David is either on the Kael bandwahon or defending his dad who is clearly on the bandwagon acc. to the original draft.

The scenes with Thallberg etc aren't mutually exclusive to the Kael stuff as the movie also spends the last 5 minutes on the authorship debate.Its not the case that Jack Fincher aiming at the bigwigs means he automatically supports Welles contribution when he clearly doesn't..

The difference between TSN and MANK.is that most people didn't know about the history of Zucc and the movie could play fast and loose with his life but most of the authorship debate and how its total hooey hatchet job by Kael thats being debunked is very well known and in 2020 it would be risky to be ao openly pro-Kael,which is why the movie isn't about all that for rhe 1st 130 minutes directly and then slips it in at the very end(but even that was too much). David removed most of the obvious stuff it seems and he's smart enough to know the heart of the story is elsewhere but he doesn't fully commit to it. Which makes the the last 5 minutes feel so disjointed from the rest of the movie.",k6zxdq

>Mank’s first meeting with actress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) takes place while she’s filming a martyr movie on the grounds of Hearst’s massive estate, San Simeon. If you’re wondering what the movie is, well … stop wondering, because it doesn’t exist. According to Davies’ biographer, Lara Gabrielle, none of the 52 movies Marion made in her career involved being burned at the stake. Gabrielle also says there’s no evidence that they ever filmed any of Marion’s features on the Hearst estate, either. In fact, much of Marion’s relationship with Mank is fictionalized, according to Gabrielle. “She may, in passing have known him, through Charlie [Lederer],” said Gabrielle, but it was far from a close friendship.",k6zxdq

gey229f,"That's a bit too confusing of a breakdown (and also wrong. He only has one wife.) The film's flashing back and forth between Mank writing Citizen Kane and the events that inspired him to write it. The event being watching his boss and his rich, powerful friend, Hearst, use the media to lie about a political race and contribute to the loss of an idealistic candidate for an establishment one. This, and the consequences that Mank faces for speaking out lead him to drunkenly rip Hearst and his politics apart at a dinner party. Hearst responds by telling him that he's nothing but a court jester to them and what he had to say was never actually that important. This is what spurs Mank on to write the script and fight for ownership over it.",k6zxdq
geykp2p,"Uhmm 1930s politics. And no, there is no relevance to today's: the screenplay was written by Fincher's father in the 1970s and he wanted to do it since the early 90s.

Let me try to summarize it, in a chronological order: Mank is an alcohoolic, umpredictable yet lovable screenwriter who in the early 1930s got involved with MGM's heads of studios and by William R Hearst, the news media mogul. He got into places in Hollywood but was eventually broken by the political propaganda machine that turned an election for a candidate he didn't support and cost the life of a friend to suicide, who was disgusted by his involvement editing propaganda reels. Mank confronts Hearst and points out his hypocrisy and manipulation, and is shun away from his tiny Hollywood world.

Mank is at his lowpoint, practically blacklisted for his behavior, when, immediately after a car accident, Orson Welles hires him to write for a film project he got full control from RKO. In order to do so, Mank must deliver it in time and be uncredited. Mank manages to barely do it, fighting his alcohoolism and creative ability with the help of care takers. He uses it to attack Hearst, although warned of the impact it might have in his career and life. Realizing his screenplay is the best he has ever written, he confronts Orson Welles and asks for screen credit.

He not only gets it, but also receives an Oscar for his screenplay - a bittersweet victory over old Hollywood and Hearst.

geswc7n,"I think part of my problem is the film touches on three or four main themes that all *could* be interesting, but doesn’t really follow through and make them as dramatically interesting as they might be.

You’ve got a self destructive alcoholic working against the clock.

You’ve got a man who socialises with powerful people, while privately skewering them through his work. 

You've got a guy with political ideals seeing them squashed by those powerful people through his own industry.

You’ve got a conflict of egos between a fading older talent and a blossoming young one.

All of these could make for a good story. The problem for me is, anytime it seems like any of the threads is starting to take off and actually go somewhere, it shifts to one of the others and never really brings it all together.

The clash with Welles comes so abruptly and late in the film, it comes across as a bit of a cheap shot at him (doubly weird as the film is obviously aping his directing style).",k6zxdq

gf1otjl,">	think Orson Welles’ tragedy lies in the mix between monumental talent and filthy immaturity. Sure, there is genius in Citizen Kane, who could argue? But when Welles says, ‘It only takes an afternoon to learn everything there is to know about cinematography,’ pfff… Let’s say that this is the remark of someone who has been lucky to have Gregg Toland around him to prepare the next shot… Gregg Toland, damn it, an insane genius

This quote you mention, first I had not seen it until you replied to me and I would like to read the entire piece, if you don’t mind sending me the link. 

Also, what is Fincher saying there? He acknowledges the greatness of Welles while pointing out that Welles had an ego and implies maybe Welles bought into his own genius a bit. So what? Fincher has an ego, all these guys do. And he’s not wrong, Toland is a legendary cinematographer. How is this any different than saying something like, “yeah Michael Jordan is the greatest but let’s not forget he had Scottie Pippen on his team too”? Why is it not okay to point out that sometimes greatness is surrounded by greatness and from that we get amazing works of art or championships? 

Again, Fincher is not calling Welles a fraud or a thief or even denying the genius. After watching Mank twice I am just not getting Orson Welles hit piece from it. And I maintain if that were Fincher’s true goal, don’t you think we would have gotten much more venom directed at Welles?

Just because there are deviations in age in other parts of the casting doesn't make Fincher's choice to surprise the audience with Mank's age any less of a deliberate choice.

Throughout the film there’s mentions of Welles providing notes/feedback and it certainly seemed like a collaborative effort. We see Mank write the first draft then it’s shipped off for Welles to use as the Director. It doesn’t go into detail about what kind of or to what extent Welles made revisions but it certainly doesn’t deny Welles contributions entirely.

Which is something that Orson Welles himself agreed about to the point t
 of sharing credit and billing with Tolland in a unprecedented move for Kane. This flies in the face of the Kael/Fincher idea that Orson was so full of ego and would ne vehemeny against the idea of sharing credit. Fincher's acting like Welles didnt give Tolland the recognition he deserved whoch is so disengenious considering the lengths Welles went to securing the recognition. 

Welles literally did more for his DP than any director did back in the 40s and most directors(including Fincher) do today. Tolland's name appearing alongside Welles is a major reason why he got the kind of appreciation most DPs will never get. 

>don’t you think we would have gotten much more venom directed at Welles?

No cause in 2020 its too stupid to go full Kael ""Orson was a phony"" and even Fincher knows that. Hence the soft implications  that Orson was hurt by his ego and coasted off the talents of his collaborators while the truth is that he was hurt by the studios butchering his work and taking away his control and he was a team player who gave credit where credit is due.

With film not feeling like film anymore in so many cases, a great looking digital movie in the theater can be the same experience.

But, if a movie is shot on film and I see it projected on film, the colors are crisper, the lighting feels more natural, the presentation has texture, and it feels like experiencing an art form, not like absorbing high quality content. And I'm not talking about the feeling I get watching 65mm IMAX. I'm talking about 65mm without IMAX and 35mm presentations. I've rarely ever seen 65mm IMAX.

That says more about the post and projection methods of movies shot on film than it says about film vs digital cinematography, but I have never looked up a movie that really felt like film in the theater and discovered afterwards it was actually another ARRI affair.

And dude no offense, but you are suicidal and there is no shame in that man. You just get too amped up on here and it’s worrisome is all. I get it, you’re 15 and alone, but it’s okay for 50+ people to have a different opinion than you. And seek counselling if you need it.
