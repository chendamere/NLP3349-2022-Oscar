The daughter was wearing a hearing aid when the youngest son was attacked in the first scene. She clearly had tried others. But they only were significantly damaged by this one.

They kill a fucking kid 2 minutes in, meaning whenever the characters get into a jam, you are tensing up because they could very well die. Babies are usually absolutely untouchable in movies, but I was gripping so hard when Blunt was trapped in the bunker with the creature and the baby. Would Blunt have to kill the baby to survive?

dwwdk95,"This movie maybe about an alien apocalypse, but it reminded me of something that really tied it to reality.  I'm Hmong and this jogged my memory of a few stories from my people fleeing of Laos.  

When the fighting in the Vietnam war started to settle, the Hmong living in Laos had to flee because they aided the US and were now being hunted down by the Communists who overthrew the Loation Monarchy.  Hmong families had to flee or die.  Most Hmong fled on foot with Communists patrolling the country with orders to find and kill those who aided the US. 

One thing mothers would do is give their babies opium so that they wouldn't cry.  Hmong people knew the effects and impacts of opium as they grew them as a cash crop for the French before the war.  Walking through a jungle, no talking, no noise, trekking to the Mekong where they can reach one of the refugee camps in Thailand.  

If a baby cried and a communist soldier heard it, that would be the end.  I feel that the Hmong fathers leading their families to safety weren't scared of the communists with AK-47's.  No, they were scared of having their families killed in front of them.  

It feels so similar to this movie.  The Father of ""A Quiet Place"" was not scared of the Aliens.  His worse fear is losing his family.",8a5qdo
dwywpz2,"One ***very*** minor thing I noticed (and was also constantly worried about) during the film: 

If these creatures have the ability to hear small sounds like leaves crunching or twigs snapping from (I'm guessing) miles away, wouldn't they be able to hear things like heartbeats, breathing, skin/muscles moving when they're standing 10 feet away from a human?

dww267f,"Right as the son got swooped up in the opening scene, it set the tone, not just for the rest of the movie, but in my theater too. There was a lot of tension happening in a lot of these scenes, that at one point, I looked around the theater and like half the people were curled up in a ball in their seats and hands were near their eyes because they had no clue what was gonna happen next... and I am not ashamed to say, this was (kind of) me too.

And man, this movie had so many great set-ups that paid off so well (the nail, the hearing aid, the rocket, etc.) and that’s mostly because the writing was short, sweet, and to the point, which made for such an effective thriller. Krasinski should be proud of this film. I am absolutely looking forward to what he has up his sleeve next!",8a5qdo
dwyx2f3,"One problem I had was that it was Day 83 (I think) in the opening scene where the toddler dies. Then it's Day 472 and the mom is pregnant. It's been more than a year, which means she wasn't pregnant during the opening scene. That means that for some reason, after seeing their child killed in front of them and knowing how loud babies are and that the creatures hunt by sound and just generally living in a shitty post apocalyptic world, they still chose to conceive another child. That just seems like an incredibly bad idea. They just saw their youngest kid get killed, they should have known better.

Also the monsters looked cool but the sounds they made were disappointing, pretty generic movie monster sounds with that screeching and the clicking noises.",8a5qdo

They appear to be relatively mindless hunters whose only real way of navigating is a good sense of hearing. I highly doubt that a species as primitive as theirs could travel across the stars to our world and plan and mount a massive invasion. They very much seem to me to be some sort of weapon that a superior race dropped on Earth to kill off humans and clear the way for the real invasion. 

The biggest indicator for me is the fact that they only hunt by sound. Their sense of smell obviously isn't up to predator levels, and they're completely blind. This is a trademark trope in scifi; a superior race creates a biological weapon to be used to hunt down and kill off a planet's occupants, but those creatures are bred with a significant weakness so as to make it harder to turn on their masters.

The performances are great, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt did a good job as parents, especially when they had their character moments with their kids.

Move along. That mother never seemed to be aware where her children are. This is a dangerous world. Everyone in the family should have at least one person with them. Especially the kids. And why the hell is she pregnant? There are plenty of ways they could've prevented that. At the very least pull out. They couldn't find condoms? Or a pharmacy to steal a plan b? Having that baby is the most irresponsible thing they did. Even if that baby was unbelievably quiet. No way they would've survived. That baby was born silent? Sure.

The cast was fantastic, with John Krasinsky doing double duty as actor and director, and Emily Blunt as solid as ever, and both kids were just great. 

Stray Thoughts:

* If you want to keep your family alive maybe don’t walk in single file with your youngest bringing up the rear.

* Lee created a soundproof bunker for the baby. If I was that family I’d be spending most of my time in that bunker.

* They cover pathways with sand so as to mute their footsteps. This is ingenious if you happen to live in area that never has wind.

* I loved the warning lights and systems of audio distractions they use.

* The “Light the Beacons” scene was a nice way to show that they were not the last people on Earth.

* A Quiet Place is mostly subtitled so young kids and illiterates beware.

Bonus Moment: Two seats down from me was a mother holding a baby, this had me quite worried as I’d head this was a very “quiet” movie, but not only did the baby not make a sound but as I got up to leave the theater I noticed the mother using sign language to her companion.

Lets you relate and grow attached to the characters and the family and takes you on a journey of discovery and horror with a sprinkle of emotion.

My main gripe with it was how quickly the rest of civilisation seemed to drop off the face of the earth with maybe a small number of survivors as indicated by the fires lit when evening came. 
Some of the characters seemed a little two-dimensional with petty resentment and rebellion but perhaps that's me nitpicking at childish folly.

This wasn't one of those movies, but I did jump a few times and I was anxious enough at some parts that I slid down in my theater seat.

And that shit was emotional. I cried. I have only cried during two movies in my entire life and John Krasinski made it happen a 3rd time.

I like that we could gather what happened without some detailed backstory. I liked that we got to hear things (or not hear things) from each characters perspective. The acting was phenomenal. The detail that went into ""sound proofing"" was pretty cool, as well. Like, the paint lines on the floor...that's something I never would have thought to include.

but this is classic popcorn horror, it doesn't always have to make sense. The thrills come from how ambiguous everything is. A lot of movies like this would start with news broadcasts describing how the world has fallen. That's not here because the audience needs to figure out what happened for themselves.

The theme of family for me was the biggest thing, the emotional core of the whole movie. You want to see them re-united and you come to really care for these characters.

I was thinking, this was Paramount right? Wouldn't it be cool if this was somehow connected to the Cloververse?

I don't watch a lot of horror films partially because I spend the entire time picking apart the structure and knowing where the jumps are going to be.

This motherfucker had me out of my seat a few times though. I don't think there was a single moment of tension, obvious jump scare moment but only tension eased with music, then turn around an monster there. It was build up and payoff immediately. Old school jump scares.

Having the kid die in the opening left you unsure if anyone was safe, and not having a single second of the film feel safe meant the underlying tension didn't give you a moment to settle. I came away with a banging headache purely because I spent swathes of the film scared to breathe.

I'd love more horrors like this that don't rely on gore and don't use cheap tension breakers all the time. I don't, however, want a sequel. It was brilliant as a stand alone, but now the monsters are weak and the humans empowered again.",8a5qdo

* What happens when you snore?

e3br46m,The least believable part of this movie is no one cursing out loud during monopoly.,8a5qdo
dwzp60p,"I don't think people actually understand what a plot hole is.  

A plot hole isn't ""well why couldn't they have figured X out earlier?""  or ""why didn't they set up X to be remote control.""  A plot hole is an inconsistency within the movie that contradicts the established fictional world the story is set in.  An example would be if James Bond in a movie pulled a wand out of his coat and started casting spells.  The James Bond world has clearly established the type of world it is in (realistic, non-magical, etc.) and turning him into Harry Potter would be a complete contradiction of what came previously.  

In terms of this movie, why didn't people figure out that a certain frequency pissed off the ""Dark Angels?""  People aren't omnipotent and with how quickly the creatures kill, who in their right mind would be like ""hey if we turn our hearing aids in a certain way it'll leave them vulnerable.""  Also given how quickly the monsters kill, I'm guessing civilization collapsed extremely quickly.  Hardly enough time for somebody to figure it out AND tell everybody about that. 

Why did Jim and Emily Blunt have a kid?  I thought it was pretty obvious a way to replace the other kid.  Is this irrational?  Yeah probably, but if people were perfectly rational then stories wouldn't exist.

Why didn't the Monster hear the baby through the waterfall?  Waterfalls are pretty loud, as are fireworks, so I could see why that worked.  Also the Monster clearly thought something was down there, it just wasn't sure where it was.

e340bq3,"I really liked it for the most part, but the ending kind of bothered me, which seems to be a common issue. John Krasinski's death seemed almost pointless and a little upsetting as he was the most competent character in the movie.

A lot like the ending of 10 Cloverfield Lane actually. 80% of both movies were nonstop tension building and horror, and the very end the protagonist is suddenly a monster hunter and they practically smile and wink at the camera.

Other than that though, it was very solid. The lack of sound was so unique. I found myself jumping any time there was a loud noise, like the shot of the river. When shit did start to go down the music fit perfectly. The sense of dread immediately after a noise was perfect. I'm also really intrigued by the appearance of the monsters themselves.

The invasion was clearly a devastating strike on a global scale. There could be *billions* of these creatures ripping through the major cities of Earth, while a mere three took root near the farm. Maybe armed forces quickly weaponized sound but were overwhelmed anyway, perhaps by a more resilient subspecies. Maybe Jim and fam unwittingly live in a quarantine zone while the real fight for humanity rages elsewhere. Maybe the creatures are only susceptible to the extremely specific frequency of this particular hearing aid. Etc, etc.

No one complains about the unrealistic spread of viruses in zombie movies. The setting requires faith that the story can stand without total explanation.

I mean, if a microphone and a shotgun can kill one....I suppose we have to assume that there were too many of them, or they have other abilities we don't know about etc. etc.

With the opening scene, I started panicking because I didnt remember ever seeing a little boy in the previews, and having two little ones myself, this film was utterly horrifying as a parent. The weight of protecting your kids, when all feels hopeless. Of wondering if you've doomed your family because of an unexpected pregnancy. How to keep a small child quiet in such a situation.

How did no one in the world think to blare loud noise at the hyper-sonic hearing creatures?

The only glaring plot hole I saw in the movie was that no one thought to use hyper frequency sounds against them earlier. Not the perfect movie but still a hell of a lot better then most horror/suspense movies we get now a days.

Then they drive him back all clawed up/out of it (to explain why they risked driving), and the final scene is the older son pressing on his dad's wound in the corner while dad shields the baby with his body. The rest plays out as is. 

This way daughter has a clear cause and effect way to figure out the weakness instead of just staring at the word 'weakness', and dad and daughter can have a powerful moment where he witnesses and appreciates her as more than a constant risk. AND daughter doesn't have to live with the guilt that she could have saved her dad as well as baby brother. Mum still gets to be a shotgun badass.

(As to why the daughter would turn on the hearing aid in the car - wild desperation to hear her dad say he loved her? Maybe never turned it off in the first place and the jostling cut it out for a minute, then jigged it back on?)

Excellent movie apart from the contrived sacrifice! Parental themes aren't too common in horror. Good acting from the daughter.

e54cdk8,"I watched A Quiet Place just a few days ago and it was very good.  Honestly, there are nowhere near as many plot holes as you guys claim.  For instance, many people complained about the Abbotts having another kid.  The explanation to that is simple; without reproduction, humanity has no future.  Additionally, with the loss of their youngest son, the parents may have been seeking to fill the void.  

People have also asked why the Abbotts didn’t just live near the waterfall.  The family had supplies where they already were, and the parents wanted their children to live a relatively normal life.  They would’ve had to either find a cave by the waterfall or build their own shelter.  If they had attempted to construct their own house, they would’ve had to carry many materials over.  As shown in the scene where the kids accidentally set the house on fire while playing Monopoly, humans are susceptible to make mistakes.  When carrying wood, metal, or anything from inside the house, if anyone had accidentally dropped what they were holding, the aliens would be instantly alerted of the family’s position.  If said person had dropped anything relatively heavy on their own foot, I think you can imagine what noises he/she would make because of the pain.  To even get wood, they would have to cut down trees.  That by itself would cause plenty of loud sounds.

Another solution that has been proposed by several people was to set up speakers around the area where the Abbotts live.  Noise made from a speaker does not sound exactly the same as whatever sound was recorded.  The aliens/monsters could easily locate the speakers and destroy them.

Several have asked why the aliens don’t attack each other since they make sound.  The film starts at Day 89.  As explained in a newspaper and on the whiteboard, they are invulnerable to bullets and bombs.  It doesn’t seem that unlikely for them to be immune to each other’s attacks.  Perhaps they had tried to fight one another in the previous 3 months.  By that point they’d have realized that their attempts at hurting other fellow aliens are futile.  Even if they could kill each other, they could be in some sort of alliance.  After all, they are most likely of the same origin; they could even have their own method of communication, just like dolphins do.

One of the few actual plot holes was that the alien could break through the wall of the silo, but couldn’t break through the truck that contained Marcus and Regan.  Both were seemingly made of metal, yet the alien could only break through one of them.

In the silo scene, there may be another plot hole.  Both Marcus and Regan sink in the corn and narrowly survive, but the alien didn’t sink as much.  Especially with such skinny legs, it should have eventually been completely submerged in the corn.

I know that I did not address every supposed plot hole, which is mostly because I have seen other people respond to some.  Please note that their may be a few actual plot holes that I did not list and that it is inevitable to have some since the whole premise of the movie is fictional.  If you would like a solution to a supposedly existent plot hole, feel free to ask me.  This includes anything I may have missed in my explanations above.",8a5qdo

The creatures seem dumb.  They are far from indestructible - like big, blind, wolves without any sense of smell.  You don't need to set off a fireworks show to get their attention.  Rocks would do.  Place sheetmetal in designated locations.  Throw a rock at it, and you can always get out of a tight jam.  You basically have the power of invisibility around them as long as you are quiet.

What I was most confused about is the monsters themselves, like if they pounce on sound why don't they just murderfuck the river 24/7 since it's loud as hell? Like can they even tell the difference between whether it's a human making sound or nature? Why do they only seem to want to kill when humans are making the sounds?

Do they try to leap into the sky when there's thunderstorms?",8a5qdo

e2xhd31,"Just finished the movie for myself. I loved it. However I think I want to take a stab at explaining the waterfall plot hole.

Firstly, a lot of people are mentioning the waterfall and river and asking why it wasn't swarming with those things. I think the reason that didn't happen is because I imagine they can tell what's natural and what's unnatural noise. Obviously certain sounds like leaves crunching, wind blowing, and crickets chirping would sort of fade in the background for them like white noise. I imagine running water isn't any different, which to me explains why Emily and her newborn weren't detected in the basement area. The water literally drowned out the cooing of the child even when it was only a few feet away from them.

Also, I was at first confused how exactly the gunshot attracted so many of the creatures but I think it ties into the fireworks. Obviously the fireworks were set off a decent distance from the house so the mother could give birth, however it seems like it doesn't attract that many of the creatures initially. I think when they set off the fireworks, the family accidentally killed off all their surrounding neighbors or drove them back into hiding. I think this because when the kids were on top of the silo, they seem to notice there weren't any other fires burning in the surrounding area. This would explain why so many others came when the shotgun blast rang out as the fireworks had attracted even more than the three that had been in the area already. Anybody else think this?",8a5qdo

Anyways, I liked the movie. Very entertaining and that's what a movie should be. Even with plotholes, even with flaws. They're only human and far from perfect.

People ask a lot of questions like; why do they not have decoys at the other side of the field? Think of their inventory. Perhaps the only decoy they could use were the fireworks. They probably didn't have speakers at all or could use them effectively in any way.",8a5qdo
e48amqx,"They can't get into a car very easily, yet we are to take it they've managed to defeat the armies of the world with all of the tanks and guns? Not a single stray bullet managed to hit one while it was listening? 

And with all that armor, are we really supposed to believe they were swimming from one continent to the next? Not that they would try, seeing as there's nothing that would motivate them to try and get across the pacific or atlantic. Because 1, they don't know if there is any land on the other side and 2 they are perfectly fine with faffing about for 2 years trying to find a single family of humans so clearly food doesn't motivate them much.

dyb93mn,"I enjoyed the film. I was surprised at how the actual final for the film actually began at the midpoint, after the nail scene, and didn't let up the tension until the end.

Because of the surprise success of the film, I see it has already been green-light for a sequel. I feel they will need to change some of the monster dynamics to make the sequel as terrifying or go the Aliens route and the sequel be more action than terror.  
  
**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  
If they are going to shoot a sequel, I wanted to discuss how they could change the monster dynamics in a way to keep the film terrifying and also explain away some inconsistencies in the first film.  
1. In the sequel, we learn the monsters are intelligent, can communicate, and are pack hunters. This would explain away the noises the monsters make, as they are communicating with one another. This would also explain why sometimes only one monster or more would show up. If they heard a noise, one would investigate for possible prey and call others if there were signs of more prey. Also, it would explain how the monsters are able to pin-point the exact location of a sound from far away, by using triangulation.  We would learn the monsters on the farm in the first film were actually pups, so they were easy to distract with sounds and generally not very good hunters. The sequel would feature older creatures that quickly become aware that the humans have developed a defensive weapon and actively try to disable it while using pack hunting techniques to outmaneuver and trap humans. That the creatures are intelligent and highly adaptive in strategy would also help to explain how they over-ran the entire military so quickly.  
2. The monsters have a secondary near-object sense, if the form of an electromagnetic field. This would explain why lights would flicker when they drew close, and also explain how the monsters did not simply crash into solid objects when running around. In the sequel, the more experienced monsters would close off their hearing to protect themselves from the human's sound device, while using their secondary senses to continue the hunt at close quarters.  
3. We learn the the monsters are targeting humans in particular, and will aggressively pursue sounds associated with human activity over other sounds. This would explain why the monsters did not hang out around the farm after killing the raccoon, but did aggressively explored the farm after the mother breaks the glass.  
4. That the monsters happen to be deaf or actually poor of hearing in certain frequencies, explain how they can't hear heartbeats at close proximity and how they don't seem to respond to all sounds as quickly. Certainly this weakness could be exploited by the humans in a sequel.  ",8a5qdo
dyci29c,"I think the nail scene is the most I've ever cringed in the cinema.

Sound design was excellent, gotta say the movie was much shorter than I thought it was going to be but even with the short running time the actors really sold the fact that they were a family. 

Krasinski is perfect in the role, you can believe him as this competent action figure and as a wholesome patriarchal figure. ",8a5qdo
dyj94iq,Confused by these comments taking the movie so seriously. Just a fun thriller. No reason to bring too much logic into this one. It’d be like criticizing Michael Myers for walking and not running. Who cares. This isn’t Westworld.  ,8a5qdo

e2g2mte,[deleted],8a5qdo
e2erof5,"A good movie but I'm not sure what all the hype over it was about.

Pros:

 - Blunt and Krasinski's performances and chemistry.  Blunt is always exceptional.  Krasinski knocked fear/determination in one look out of the park.

 - Great soundtrack, if not *too* influenced by Sicario.

 - Some really great 90's Spielberg-esque moments.

Cons: 

 - The monster designs were pretty uninspired and boring.  A great monster movie needs a great monster and these were about as generic as it got.  They just weren't frightening or interesting to look at.  If not for the tension in the scene, they wouldn't be scary.

 - Nothing cripples a monster movie like a monster that doesn't make sense, because you're no longer watching people survive against a creature but rather against the plot.  And these monsters didn't make *any* sense.  They could hear glass break inside a house from a field away but can't hear a baby gurgling or heavy breathing in the same room?  They could puncture a thick steel door but couldn't get into a truck?

 - Also, it seemed to me like the family enjoyed the monsters.  Because there was a billion other options they had.  They could put speakers out far from the house in case of emergencies.  They could throw things to make noises further away.  They could shout in one spot and then...run to another spot.  I mean...why didn't anyone try that?  Why was making noise something you could only do in one spot?  It's not like the creatures could hear footsteps.

 - Some of the newspaper articles on the wall were hilarious.  'Angels of Death'?  What asshole wrote that headline about monsters?

 - The boy's performance when talking to his dad was just awful.  I get he's a child actor but...it was just awful.

Scariest part in the movie:

 - The Nail

It wasn't a bad movie.  Smartly edited, great eye for cinematography, a cool idea, and great performances from its stars.  And looking for plot holes after is always fun for horror flicks.  But when you're spotting plot holes *during* a scary movie, it tends to deflate it.  To the movie's credit, even after those moments it managed to pick up the tension again and keep moving.  Even if it popped another tire around the next corner.

A solid 7/10.",8a5qdo

No one figured its weakness? Seems like the first thing you would try.

Took them around a year and a half to make a sound proof room?

River is loud but the creatures aren't attracted to it? You can argue that they used to it...so why not just live there?

They utilize fireworks to attract the creatures but don't think about setting up speakers all over to blast music or something and confuse them? Hell even a dog whistle or something? 

The girl knew how to work the radio equipment even though the movie made the point that she has never been down there.

I think a lot of people question how the military or government couldn't have figured out how to kill the monsters as their weakness seems pretty obvious. I'm not sure I buy this as a legit criticism. What the film does well is follow a small, self-contained story. For all we know the government could have figured this out and 50k people are sat in a walled city surrounded by gigantic speakers blaring out white noise, but that's not the point. This family aren't there, and are figuring out on their own. I like that - makes for a leaner story.

LOVED the birthing scene - such an awesome building of tension. Waters breaking, the lights changing (oooh that's what those are for) the nail, the picture, the timer alarm, the monster coming up the stairs.

Another moment that stand out is when then daughter is looking for her brother in the corn field and the sound stops and we see the monster behind and she has no idea as can't hear the rustling. AWESOME moment.

Did find myself getting the feels when the dad cries out and the signed dialogue before it. Really surprised by how much I cared about the family by that point. So often in horrors you really don't give a shit who dies and when, you always know one will remain at the end... this felt very different.

At first I didn't realise why the mum and dad constantly put their fingers to their lips when something was about to go down - I thought 'well duh, you always have to be quiet' but then realised the daughter literally can't hear a thing - she NEEDS the visual cue, else she won't know to be extra quiet. Nice touch.

Couple of small irks - kinda wanted there to be zero music in this. Get the audience used to almost silence the entire way through the film so that any noise makes the audience freak out as much as the characters.

Also think the addition of extra monsters was a mistake. One seems terrifying enough and the only purpose the others seemed to have was the ending and that shotgun pump that I hates. Seemed to fall into the trap that many horror films do - unless you end on an 'oh shit' or a 'fuck yeah' moment then it's bad. The script has a much more wholesome and complete ending.",8a5qdo

Since it featured children, I was thinking ""oh great, another 'scary' movie where the kids are never actually in danger because writers don't kill kiddies"". Wellp, didn't take long for that one to be written off, so there's an ACTUAL sense of 'anyone can be killed', unlike other suspense movies. Love it.

It does annoy you when you think about what they could've done differently. Why not live by the waterfall? Why don't they all carry objects like that toy around, which can emit a noise? When they're in danger they could simply throw the object and run. The monsters also seem to use echolocation to navigate while running at high speeds (running through trees without smashing into one...), which would mean their echolocation would have to be accurate as hell.

Don't get me wrong, it was a very solid 7/10 and definitely worth the price of admission, but I feel that there were a few too many plot holes that could have easily been edited out (the multiple flame beacons indicating others that were never remarked upon, the fact that they left pictures hanging on the wall, etc.) which took me out of the movie a bit. As a result, it was less effective as a horror movie than, say, Annihilation or IT 2016. It was constantly stimulating but, except for the birth sequence, never gripping.

Emily Blunt was fantastic, and the creature design was great. I hope John Krasinski hones himself a bit more in this genre because I think he's definitely capable of directing a really great horror movie with a bit more experience. ",8a5qdo

That was cool. And the fathers character was very systematic and logical, how he wrote down bullet points about aliens and was trying to figure out their weak spot, or how to fireworks were set up so he could mask the gunshot sounds in case he ever needs to fire a gun. That man was smart. And he was raising his kids to be smart, and his wife was smart too.

So the movie basically invites us to appreciate the logic and common sense, even look for it. And then it leaves us with these huge fucking plot holes, stupid jump scare points and the cheesy ending.",8a5qdo
dxeczyl,"A lot of people are asking why the family's survival skills seem to have fallen apart on the last day, when they had 400+ days to work on them. Here's my theory.

Up to the day in question, I think the father mostly handled the ""outside world"". He collected sand, established the perimeter, tinkered, engineered, fished and sought out others. Since day 89, his children mostly stayed inside the perimeter, where his wife tried to create a world as ""normal"" as possible.

Father's decision to finally bring his son fishing, preparing him to survive without the father's actions, set the end in motion. It:

1. Angered the daughter, who went to the bridge instead of staying at the house and helping her mother. 

2. This led to the mother trying to carry too much wet laundry up the stairs, by herself, catching laundry bag on the nail, which pulls up the nail she later steps on.

3. The return from the fishing trip also terrified the son (seeing the monster who took out old man) who was then so panicked, he disobeyed father's rules for hiding from the creatures (staying put quietly), instead making himself an easy target.

4. Angry daughter also ignored father's rules at the bridge, at the silo, in the cornfield...making her an easy target.

5. Having children NOT follow rules created situations where father was put in harm's way  and mother was put in danger (stepped on nail, made noise which attracted creature to house).

Murphy's Law, anyone?

Monster was scary when you didn’t see it but they showed it at the point when you needed to be glued to the screen and watch them run etc

Then on the opposite end, when the father gets swiped by the fella on the roof, he wasn't making any (particular) noise.

I do wish the script would have called for something other than her pregnancy to be the inciting event that formed the catalyst for the climax of the movie. But it definitely keeps the intrigue going during the largely silent and uneventful 1st half of the movie wondering how they’ll pull it off considering the conditions. Too bad they didn’t set this in rural Pennsylvania. The Quaker tradition of silent births may have been a nice touch, but perhaps that was too on the nose. 

Still, I though Krasinski showed a deft hand at crafting this thriller with some touching family scenes, as well. As I mentioned, the performances were top notch, especially young Actress and Emily Blunt! Bravo!

If this HAD been a part of the clover field universe, i’d Say they had one of the best franchises around. For an original piece of entertainment, I think this might be might favorite movie of the year so far.

It was very tense, very scary, even when my friend and I were eating/shifting in our seats we did it as quietly as possible. It was as if we were experiencing the events right alongside the characters instead of knowing we were sitting in a theatre and watching a movie. As the experience it self was very good I will give this movie a 8/10.

**The things I liked about the movie**: 

The bathtub/birthing scene with the fireworks was so intense, with Emily’s character stepping on the nail and her water breaking leading towards that loud scream in the tub. 

I think with the use of sign language as a replacement for most dialogue in the movie, it made many scenes have more emotion/feeling. e.g.) John’s character’s death at the end of the film. I feel like him signing that he always loved his daughter drew out a lot more emotion in this scene. Not going to lie but I cried pretty bad during it... 

Also may I add... The scene with the old man in the forest... Really terrifying, but added good effect of consequences the characters may face if the monsters got to them.

**Some questionable things about the movie for me:** 

How did these monsters come to the Earth?

If they were attracted to noise how come the military/army didn’t blast sound in an area then nuke the place when the monsters were grouped there? (like one of the end scenes in World War Z)

Imagine sleeping, and you snore... RIP.

Upon seeing the trailer and seeing Emily’s character pregnant, I assumed that she got pregnant before the invasion. But after seeing the movie... I know they lost a child... But why risk getting pregnant during a time with monsters like this... Babies cry...a lot.

And as it has been stated numerous times before, their bodies were armoured and their weak point is only visible when they are zoning in on noise or in pain. Now let’s pretend these super hearing monsters don’t kill you as you try to make noise and distract them so you shoot them in the weak spot, without that certain noise frequency to paralysis and distract them, the super speed will probably lead to your demise before you kill it.

3. Why didn't Jim notice the water pouring out of the broken pipe above where his wife and newborn child were holed up?

Nope, thing's just fast as fuck.  I have to admit as big of an emotional punch/tone setting moment the kid's death was, seeing the monster go for the stylish one shot on him made the part of me that wasn't shocked giggle a bit.

Very nitpicky thing, but I'm sitting here and accepting the whole background noise covering breathing and all of that, but if loud noises are so obscuring, how is that waterfall not just blocking their hearing for miles?

* why didn't they have a switch (like the red lights) that plays audio 1/8 mile away out of a speaker?

dxto7uw,"A little bit late to the party, just saw the movie yesterday and I really liked it. It has flaws but I really liked it, and I've been thinking a lot about the _plotholes_ in the movie and although there valid ones, there are also others that can be explained, i think:  
  
1. Electricity and the world outside their farm: I think that there is a power plant somewhere in the distance, and even though it makes a lot of noise, it is a _consistent_ noise. That is the buzzing/humming of the generators inside the plant is _always their_ and I think that the creatures are intelligent. If they are attracted to any kind of sound then you'd expect them to hang around the waterfalls right? But why weren't they there? I think that they hear everything, and have learned consistent ambient noise, and the humming of very loud generators is part of that consistent ambient noise. That's why when a new noise is introduced, like that toy plane they recognise a deviation and chase after it.  
  
2. Why they had a baby: much like in hunger games, you'd expect people from shitty districts to stop having babies but they don't. Because, they were trying to live a normal life, and having sex is a part of that? And, although it might not be a conscious decision that _hey lets make another baby_ they are still human and that's part of what keeps them alive in a crazy nightmare of a world.  
  
3. The military and government: I think they have discovered the weakness but a) the family has been cut off from communication lines and that those newspapers were from the say, Day 50 to 100? and b) the monsters have been eliminated in large areas and what we are seeing is an isolated area and they are awaiting rescue. As far as I can see it's a small town along a railway? It's not easy to find monsters in the entire country, and as the fire signals showed us, neighbours are far away, more proof that it's a small rural farm town.  
  
Just a few thoughts. ü",8a5qdo

https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/04/08/screaming-questions-john-krasinski-quiet-place/484128002/

For me, two jump out. One, there is no way that the sum total of the world’s armies wouldn’t have figured out very quickly that (1) the creatures react to sound and (2) the sound can be weaponized. Unless the creatures evenly coated the world on a single day, which cleary isn’t the case since society functioned enough to deliver news papers for some time, a research team would have come up with the obvious conclusion. Honestly, this is not trying to derive a new form of mathematics. If a random family can work it out then military intelligence can as well. Especially since the world already has sonic weapons. Maybe these people are isolated as the army hasn’t swept this area yet, but it seems unlikely it would get to that point.

This one is ok though, zombie outbreaks wouldn’t succeed either but they make for great movies. My bigger issue is for people who are so worried about their kids, the parents don’t seem to understand just how precarious a situation they are in. Just how did they survive till day 70, never mind day 400? The littlest kid nearly makes fatal noise mistakes twice when they are at the store, before he actually dies. How is he allowed to run around the store unsupervised instead of being locked up? Even after that, the kids seem likely to get into so many noise issues. How many ‘board game night incidents’ must they have been lucky for to survive till this day?

I guess part of the issue is it’s not clear what the creatures can or can’t hear. It seems like they hear high frequencies only, since running up to one still leaves you invisible. But then they still track people for no real reasons. Why was one looking for the deaf girl after the fireworks scene?

How tf can the newspaper companies print and distribute their papers around America with the weakness of the monsters on the front? 

Why didn't they just live near the waterfall? Or at least have some kind of camp there to use during her last month of pregnancy? Surely they could build one because he could scream near the waterfall?

Why can the monster hear something smash underground from like a mile away, but not hear the baby goo goo noises from across the room?

While I found it scary, it wasn’t the annoying kind of scary. Sometimes I have to peek between my fingers in horror movies although it’s my favorite genre but I was able to easily watch this one. I thought it was unique and refreshing for the horror genre! 

I was emotional during a few scenes but I couldn’t help but bust out laughing when the wife, husband and baby were in the bunker and she asks “where are they?” To which the husband replies “I will find them.” I thought it was hilarious but in a good way. Also the very last scene was amusing.

I had a couple of questions and a comment.
First, no way they would let the youngest trail behind them, even a sneeze would do him in.  

I would have had 10 egg timer grenades just in case. 

They hint at but never followed up on, there are other survivors lighting the fire signals but when the daughter looks, it is dark.  
Are they dead?  Did they all die the same night?  

And WTH?  The Nail?  Did they ever explain because I missed it.

Do y'all think John was actually supposed to be an engineer? Because personally, I thought he was just a farmer. Exhibit a -- obviously the farm they live on. Exhibit b -- if he owns a modern farm in 2018, he definitely is a bit of a jack of all trades. Being able to solder is part of that, as well as being built as fuck, and a resourceful handiman.

One of the other things about the film that I loved was the script. There were only a handful of lines in the whole film but every spoken sentence greatly added to emotional weight and intensity of the film. ""Do you still love her,"" and ""Promise me you'll protect them"" (paraphrased) perfectly sum up what the movie is all about. A relationship between a dad trying to protect his kids no matter the cost, and the kids who want to feel loved and safe and who are looking to find that protection in their dad. Its a beautiful love story told in a very eerie and unnerving way, which I think only makes the sacrifice and loss that much more gut wrenching. 

On a separate note, can you actually sink in corn? ",8a5qdo

Was kind of disappointed they started to make noises frequently as I thought it would be pretty much dead silent with no things like breathing being heard even.

Also, I think this is one of those movies that really would have benefited from a R rating. It kind of was ruined for me that the monsters just didn't feel scary which kind of hurt the experience to me.

*They had newspapers everywhere, one called the monsters ""indestructible"" with a picture of heavily armed men. So how did Emily Blunt manage to kill the monster with one shot? I understand it was because she shot it in the right spot, but wouldn't it make sense that someone in the military would also shoot the right spot at some point?

*The monsters obviously have super-sensitive hearing, how did nobody immediately think, ""maybe loud or high-pitch noises would be their weakness""?

*Why wouldn't the family try to gather as much food as they could and just hunker down for the month surrounding the Mother's due date to avoid any risk?

*Since the monsters are completely blind, why not just carry something to throw in another direction every time a monster got near you?",8a5qdo

 1. In a world where everyone was killed by monsters, why would two parents be walking in front with their children behind them? Maybe bookend so you can see when your dumb problematic son is gonna whip out the loudest toy rocket to ever exist. 

2. You decided that you were gonna have a BABY?? Like I get keeping your relationship alive or whatever but idk, maybe while you’re visiting one of the 4729382948 empty pharmacies for your kids meds, grab a condom or maybe some birth control? Because babies cry, a lot, and you can’t just keep it in your baby box all day. 

3. Fishing scene. Apparently you can make some noise by the river, which made me ask “why not live there?”

 4. I’m supposed to believe John krasinski can learn how to build a functional hearing aid but couldn’t figure out that you might be able to hurt a sound driven monster with sound?

 5. If they were able to shoot these things, am i supposed to believe that the military wasn’t shooting at them/couldn’t kill them for some reason?

Before her father sacrificed himself, she had already gotten out of TWO certain death experiences at the field and silo. How could she not have already concluded at that point it was the device scaring them off? I get that sometimes the audience will know more than the characters at certain points, but the fact that the movie emphasizes this weakness blatantly for 2 scenes only for the girl to decide to turn off the device at a crucial moment makes me scratch my head. It makes the father's death feel more like the story's need for a dramatic send off rather than a necessary sacrifice.](#spoiler)

EDIT: [I can see the argument that the daughter may not have picked up on it the the first 2 times, but what doesn't work for for me is that the movie makes it very obvious to the audience, such as zooming in on the monster's ear picking up the sound. So with this obvious information it just makes it frustrating to see the girl not see it also multiple times. I think the movie revealed the weakness too early and would have been benefited from waiting later. Maybe perhaps show the girl writhing in pain but not show that the monster is picking up the sound, that way the audience also can be confused as the girl until the end where both the girl and the audience can have the ""ah ha"" moment together.](#spoiler)",8a5qdo

The fucking nail fucked me up. I knew someone would step on it and then I expected one of the kids to step on it too. The scene where the mom stepped on it while she’s in labor was awful I was biting my nails the whole time. 

The dynamics between husband and wife, mom and son, dad and daughter, the kids, it was all so... realistic. In no part did I feel like those relationships were fake or inaccurate.

I was waiting for it to develop, even a little bit, as it went on, but I felt like it just kept hitting the same couple of beats all through the film: We are going to make a noise and then be quiet for second or two and then there is going to be a LOUD NOISE as the creature stomps in.

And, in my opinion, everything seemed a little rushed. For all the talk of how much 'nail-biting suspense"" the movie builds up, I felt that every time they established a set piece, it seemed it was over in an instant. 

And whether it was John Krasiniski being miscast, or something else, I just didn't buy all the tension between him and the daughter. Not to mention, how clumsily it was handled in the writing - the script had to go out of its way to hide things from characters that would have solved the problems instantly. 

I've seen so few opinions like mine that I'm conceding that maybe it's my problem! LOL. So, I'm going to check it out again this coming weekend with another friend - maybe I just wasn't in the right mood when I saw it. ",8a5qdo
dyd7diw,"1. The mom seemed to have the shortest labor ever. Maybe it was a couple hours, but it felt way shorter.

2. When the dad lit the signal and a bunch more flared up from all around, but towards the end the kids lit the signal and there weren't any others... that messed me up.

3. The newspaper headlines said something about ""get to safety underground"" which makes a lot of sense (and seemed to be foreshadowing to the soundproof basement they brought the baby to). It would be cool if the sequel involved a bunker.

4. If these aliens got to Earth via a meteor that landed in New Mexico, are they just crazy fast swimmers to have wiped out all the other continents too within like a year? Or were there multiple meteors that landed all over the world? I would love to learn more about the backstory of the aliens and the first couple weeks of them being here.",8a5qdo

e1pw3bf,"Movie was ok. I had so many issues with it though. It is hard to have a movie with no speech or music. The music thing was weird. Me finishing the movie shows that they did a great job with it even though it was weird at times. Sometimes I felt everyone was just standing around at times tho. However I felt killing Big Tuna was not that impactful. He should have lived. Another thing that bothered me was in the beginning when someone made a noise they were instantly killed in a second. Later on when someone made a noise there was a lot of time between when the monsters attacked. One other gripe was they didnt really setup any fail safes besides one set of firecrackers. You would think they would have all sorts of diversionary tactics. Like the whole time I am thinking they should setup some sort of sound emitting devices on the other end of town while living comfortably on the other. The kids annoyed the crap out of me too. They were so terrible at living that I could not help but blame the parents. It was good, kinda like how Annihilation was good  but not great. Oh one more thing. WHY LEAVE THE FUCKING NAIL STILL STICKING OUT???!!?!?!?!?!",8a5qdo
e248pq2,"**Things I liked:**

- I thought they set the scene well with how fucking paranoid the characters were at the beginning in regards to trying to make as little sound as possible. Put me on edge a bit not gonna lie. 

- The ""quiet"" aspect of the film. I was skeptical at first wondering if I could handle a movie with very little talking, and I found it to be a nice change of pace tbh. 

- The creature design was pretty cool I thought. It was like a mix of venom, demogorgon, and [this] (https://thumbs.gfycat.com/NimbleSmartAsiaticmouflon-size_restricted.gif)

- That headphone scene was such a shoutout to The Office, I loved that

- I did like that he creatures weren't attacking noises/people to eat them, they were doing it to eliminate the noise to make the environment more suitable for them.

**Things I didn't like:**

- I guess I was expecting a bit more depth to the movie based on the critical reception? It was just pretty straight forward. 

- The fireworks that far away are not loud enough to mask a scream from a creature right next to you.

- The creature reveal was a bit too early I think. It was hard to feel worried or unsettled from that point on aside from the jump scares. 

- While I liked the quiet aspect of the movie, I think it was detrimental to making a connection to the characters. I didn't really care if any of them died tbh.

- Why was the smallest child walking behind the rest of the family??? Lmaoo that boggled my mind.

- Why are you having a child - an actual ticking time bomb in this sort of world??

- Not the movie's fault, but the whole time I was just trying to think of random shit you couldn't do because it would make too much noise lol

I just finished watching, so I'd give it a 6.5/10? I enjoyed it but I guess I was a little underwhelmed. I saw all the critical praise it was getting, but knew literally nothing about the movie (I didn't even realize the SNL skit, A Kanye Place was spoofing it until I saw the strung up lights in the movie), so the premise of the movie was cool, but like I mentioned above, it felt just a bit too straight forward. I feel like this movie had a lot of potential though, and I don't want to say it ruined it cause it didn't, but they kind of took the easy path. ",8a5qdo
dwy2wwy,"I really enjoyed this movie! I've been looking forward to it since I saw the first bit of information about it, and since then I've been eagerly waiting.

The experience of seeing this in the theater was definitely worth it because of how involved the audience was. It's strange, but I people shifting uncomfortably in their seats or the guy in the row behind me whispering ""Oh fuck me"" when she stepped on the nail didn't take away from the movie at all. Usually I dislike when anyone makes any sort of noise in a theater, but for this movie, it really felt appropriate.

People are complaining about the girl not being able to figure out the hearing aid thing, but remember, she figured it out the SECOND time she witnessed it. The first time it actually happened, she didn't even know the monster was there. The second time, it happening in the silo. And the third time, she figured it out. So she made the connection after witnessing the effect it had only twice. I'd say she's pretty smart, especially for being so young.

I really thought we were going to have to watch Emily Blunt smother the baby at some point, but thankfully I didn't have to see that. I honestly can't believe the characters decided to have ANOTHER kid after their youngest made noise and immediately died. Like, that's a lot of risk. And we know that they weren't even super confident in their plan of the sound-proof room because they were surprised (or relieved, maybe?) when it actually worked after Jim carried her downstairs after giving birth. I understand the symbolism of human resilience and the need to carry on the race, but damn, at least confirm that the sound-proof room is ACTUALLY sound-proof before you have a kid.

My favorite aspect of this movie is that every character was very believable. I was dreading a movie in which every character made zero noise, which didn't seem plausible, but that's not how it went down: the boy knocked over the lamp, Emily Blunt dropped the picture when she stepped on the nail and screamed during childbirth. It all made sense and felt right.

I also liked that there the movie didn't make a big deal of the daughter thinking the dad didn't love her. Of course he still loves her and I'm sure he doesn't blame her. He didn't seem like the type. He didn't leave her behind on the fishing trip because he hates her... it's because she can't fucking hear anything! I wouldn't take her anywhere. When you're out and about like that, you need to be completely aware of how much noise you're making and of the noises in your surroundings. Anyways, I'm just glad her angst didn't lead to the dad having to sacrifice himself, or her dying because she runs away from home, or some other dumb shit. Too cliche.

Even if you don't like scary movies, I highly recommend this movie! It's definitely suspenseful, but there are only like two really bad jump-scares and the rest of the movie is definitely worth it!",8a5qdo
dwysr6c,"Great movie! All the actors were amazing. The pure ebb and flow of tension was wonderful. I did draw the short straw in that my viewing had multiple obnoxious teenagers. (Laughing, talking, phones, even one ""comedian"" yelling out stuff to the characters)",8a5qdo
dwznma2,"Loved every second of it. The characters and their arcs are so well written and represented so beautifully in a movie with hardly any dialogue. Just astounding work. The monster itself wasn't the focus either. The point wasn't to be afraid OF the monster, but to be afraid FOR the characters. And they hit it out of the park. 

Krasinski's arc is probably the most subtle, but had the biggest effect on me. But, I'm a dad and I understand.

And of course, the overall film isn’t about the monsters so the plot issues with them feel naturally secondary. The family dynamics are great, the acting is impeccable, which given the dynamics of the film it’s actually a point I think people gloss over. They really are able to convey a lot silently, sure we have the sign language, but their body language is also very convincing. The directing is tight. Camerawork is clean.

They should have had multiple rocket setups. 

Were they always like 50 feet from a monster? One noise and they were there in seconds. Do they just roam the woods when not hearing anything?",8a5qdo
dx0kdbr,"I enjoyed this film for the most part. It was tense and some of the jump scares were actually pretty scary. I got a little frustrated with a couple of the scares because they didn't involve the monster. Turning the reveal that Emily Blunt survived into a jump scare was gratuitous at best.

I think they could've kept the monsters off screen in that first part where rocket kid dies. I think showing the monster too early took away the opportunity to imagine what they were before seeing them more later.

Other than that I don't have much negative to say about this movie. Sure the characters make a lot of bad decisions, but that is a staple of the genre. A horror movie with perfect protagonists is a boring movie. 

The emotional core of the film was about a man trying to protect his family, especially his deaf daughter. He wants to keep trying to restore her hearing because without it she's a lot more vulnerable. In the end his inability to give his daughter the help she wanted culminated in him giving her the helped she needed, something she wouldn't appreciate until after his death. He leaves his family a fighting chance to survive without him, but the future is always uncertain, thus the ending of the film. 

I appreciated the ending because it was the natural conclusion to the story. To continue the film past that point would've meant needing to shift genres, which would've been pretty jarring (10 Cloverfield Lane comes to mind).

dx0kmnh,"I'm not seeing it mentioned as I scroll through the comments, the one thing I really didn't get is why they'd choose to live in a creaky old farmhouse in the middle of the country where sounds are going to carry farther.

dx116pr,"Definitely had flaws and inconsistencies that could be frustrating (most have been mentioned, but why don't the monsters attract other monsters when they make noise?), but it was a really cool movie overall. 

The ending was eh, but I'm viewing it as a post-apocalyptic slice of life movie. We see a bunch of characters make questionable decisions, but between half of them being children and the fact that we're ONLY seeing three days out of the 480 or whatever that they've survived, it means they've made a lot of right decisions too.

 With that out of the way, that a fantastic thriller concept. I was engaged the whole movie, and as others pointed out, the monsters weren't the only things we worried about which is a masterful concept. We worried about nails in floorboards, leaves, anything in the world that could make a sound. The ""silent"" performances were fantastic, I definitely felt this was a family that cared for each other and wanted to keep an eye out for each other's back. I did sorta get into the rhythm of the movie and by the end I wasn't quite as nervous as I was for the first half, though I root for the characters all the way though. If you have the chance, go into an intimate, less popular theater for this movie, because a younger, more annoying crowd can really spoil the vibe of this film. ",8a5qdo

Instead, I would have liked to see the monsters characterized a bit better. Maybe see them plotting to get the people to screw up, or coordinating against them and learning their habits. The monster’s were sort of boring and one dimensional, I felt.

Overall a good movie, but the one dimensionality of the characters doesn’t make it very rewatchable for me.",8a5qdo

- Set simple traps for the creatures; spikes in a pit in the ground etc (although digging would be noisy but there are lots of alternative solutions)

Half the people on here are complaining about things that really don’t matter or relate to the central plot of the movie at all. The movie isn’t made to satisfy your need for realism, it’s made to tell a tale of survival and it succeeds in that. It doesn’t matter if they could have lived somewhere else with more noise to drown theirs out or avoided having a baby like *smart* adults.

Oh, and all this while a fucking horse-sized insectile nightmare monster is literally inches away, listening intently with its super-hearing for *any* sign of prey - you know, like a great big fat woman in a tub about to give birth to a very noisy piece of bacon. She has the discipline to wait for the fireworks before screaming, which also impressed me.

She was just hands-down a real badass woman. They were all really badass and awesome in their own ways, but Emily Blunt's scenes with the monster stuck out to me in the end.

Like being barefoot. Honestly that was my biggest issue!

Seemed entirely too risky to risk it!  Even if you can't risk the smacking of shoes, wouldn't some kind of foot protection like thick socks work better than completely bare foot? That irked me!

Also, bringing the entire family along for a supply run - again too risky. Why bring such a little kid that clearly doesn't understand that noise=death. Too much temptation, and too much risk. But I get it helped start the plot. But still. You don't put all your eggs in one basket like that, realistically. 

Otherwise I loved the details like others said, of the chip packets being left behind, the game board pieces being felt and pompoms and stuff that doesn't make any sort of noise etc.

Idk, I couldn't find this world that Krasinski built to be believable at all.

Killing it with a shotgun at the end almost ruined the entire movie for me. So, the aliens aren't bulletproof. Maybe their outer scale is bullet proof, but they are just animals at the end of the day. And kind of stupid too.

Why couldn't the military kill them all by just using sound bait? like a huge loud speaker, bait all the creatures to it, and then drop some MOABs on them.

Or even more simple- literally every time it showed the monster getting within 10 ft of a human, they conveniently open up the side of their head and flash their ear holes to every one. 

So couldn't you just stand really still next to an alarm clock, wait for it to open its ear hole to you, and then blast it right there with a shotgun.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, the aliens/monsters were really, at teh end of the day, basically just really scary tigers or something. Just an animal hunting. And humans, in groups, could never be defeated by a a non-sentient animal like that.

Absolutely everything the family does revolves around the fact that their daughter is deaf. They must take every precaution because her disability puts her at a specific disadvantage in the world. Where a child with moderate to severe autism is pretty much destined to fail in a conventional school setting, a deaf child is pretty much destined to die in the world of A Quiet Place.

Regan is able to acknowledge her disability and the strain that it puts on her family. She internalizes her self-loathing until she convinces herself her parents would prefer for her to be dead. What she didn't understand is that the hoops the family jump through to give her the chance to survive never made anyone resent her. Parents will do anything they can to give their children a chance. The tragedy is when the child discovers too late. At the end of the movie she must learn how to survive in a world that isn't going to accommodate her disability. The audience is left to imagine if the family can survive on the memory of a father's love alone. ",8a5qdo

- how did things get this bad with no one figuring out how to kill the monsters. They are blind !! Did the military do nothing? It looks like a single grenade would kill one of these.

I am fine with movies that don't spell everything out (Fury Road is a great example) but what happened? How do you know the rivers mask sound? Why don't you live there? Why don't you live in the spot in the house no one can hear you? The movie requires you to suspend your disbelief to a giant degree. 

Also the entire movie felt like a third act. No arc for any characters, no real reason to care or like ANY of the characters. It's a movie that is in the middle: wants to be character driven but also have an interesting world but unfortunately never captures any of those elements well.

[Ok, so to kill the aliens, Regan's cochlear implant (and, yes, it was a cochlear implant, not a hearing aid. A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?! Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them?

How did the water main break after they had the baby and John’s character left to find their other kids? Was it from damage from when the alien when they first got into the soundproofed basement? 

And to the same end, how did the alien get into the basement when Emily’s character wakes up in the flooded basement? Was it attracted to the (new) sound of pouring water? Or did the baby crying attract him (and why was his crib uncovered if the point was to muffle the sound)?

I've always thought horror movies were movies that involved ghost, ghouls, supernatural beings that make it difficult to go to bed after you see them. Thats why I don't like seeing them lol. This movie had a bunch of ""boo"" scares, which i prefer lol. 

I also think the fact that it was post-apocalyptic made it more thriller/sci-fi than horror. Had the plot involved some alien/monsters only terrorizing a small, secluded town full of people, I would have considered it more horror and would not have gone seen it. But, the post-apocalyptic angle made me think of sci-fi which I'd see anytime.

From the moment Emily stepped on the nail until the Tuna took them to the shelter my heart was pounding like crazy. There were some teenagers in my theater who were a bit loud (thank god for that usher who repeatedly told them to be quiet), but overall, what a terrific movie experience.

Some observations:

* The aliens seem to be ""tuning"" for frequencies, is that right?

* The nail made ma really anxious. I wss expecting one of them to step on it again.

* Weakness??? It's sound!

* That ending with the shotgun is  epic!

* Tuna's death made me cry. I love that there's also silence in the family's relationship, especially between the father and the daughter. And breaking that silence with an I love you and a scream to save his children, I had goosebumps all over. Such a powerful scene. ",8a5qdo

I also felt that it has similar vibes to most of M. Night Shyamalans work (family themes, relying on suspense instead of gore, beautiful simple cinematography), but whereas Shyamalan relies on quirky characters and art house cinematic styles, Krasinski relies on focused story-telling and steady, but intense pacing.

I thought for a second they killed the baby.  I was very confused when she woke up and the first thing out of her mouth wasn’t about the baby.  And they were apologizing to each other about the things they had to do.  Was that gas not oxygen?  Why did she bother making a nursery!? Maybe I’m projecting my own feelings when we had a kid...

1. No one thought of just having an audio alarm to play when monsters are near? Seems pretty obvious. Not the frequency thing(that's 200iq), just like loud music. I like the ""Rockets,"" but they don't last long.

2. No portable ""Rockets?"" A glass bottle or brick to toss and run.

3. How does the deaf girl know how much noise she's making with her footsteps?

4. Fuck that dumbass for running into the loud cornfield.

5. Best scene was silo scene! Idk how the girl was pulled up tho.

6. I get that the aliens(?) have a tactical weakness, but I wasn't a fan of how it had such an obvious physical weakness. It's like shooting the red spot of a video-game boss.

7. I wish the movie was longer. I also wish they met more characters at the other silos.

I felt that some of the scenes could've been plumped out a little, mainly the waterfall scenes and the boy at the beginning; with that there could've been a few close calls before the main movie begins.

The monopoly scene is also confusing, later on in the movie the creatures stay around the farmhouse for the rest of the movie, but after dancing on the rooftop and nibbling on some local wildlife they peace out in that scene.

The birthing scene is also a bit silly, though it was probably done to draw tension, as after the monsters left, Emily had enough time to clean up the baby, dress and swaddle it, then collapse exhausted in the shower?",8a5qdo

There was one scene that really stood out to me that I thought was very powerful:  

I think the old man committing suicide is one of the greatest scenes in the movie. Looking back on it, I think the man committed suicide by creature because he had nothing left to live for. He was hopeless. Lee committed suicide because doing so preserved everything he had to live for. In this sense, I think during this final scene Lee was full of hope. I thought it was so powerful looking back on it because it showed the two dichotomies in a very raw situation.

Did anyone else interpert that the same way, or can explain why he did that?",8a5qdo
dxfy32o,"I loved the experience of watching the movie, because it was so well done, so perfectly produced, that I can't remember ever being so scared in the theater.

That said, there were a couple plot holes and more than a few character stupidities that bothered me during the movie, and quite a bit afterwards.

When the kids fall in the corn, they immediately begin sinking as if the corn is draining below. They desperately try to stay ""afloat"", and can only do so once they're on the metal door. However, once the monster is in, they are able to stay on top of the corn just fine, even when both the metal door and monster is on top of them. And the monster itself, being just a mass of thin limbs, somehow doesn't sink in the corn at all???

Why is there a nail sticking point up in the stairs? That's just not how you make stairs. You don't hammer nails through a board the wrong way, think ""Oh, someone could step on it."", and hammer it sideways to fix it. That just doesn't happen. And if it does, someone would have had the sense long ago to pull the damn nail out.

Why would this family plant acres and acres of corn? You can't harvest corn quietly. You can't walk through corn quietly. Plant peas or something. I never even saw them eating corn the entire time.

So they know that they can yell and be as noisy as they want next to that waterfall, and the monsters won't find them. So why are they living in a barn in a very quiet area, instead of in a tent or other shelter right next to the waterfall? Especially right before they knew she was going to give birth. Their food supply and water supply are right there as well.

If they could rig up a light system to notify when danger is present, why would they not also rig up distraction noises along with those lights? Sirens, music, whatever could draw the monster out when it's attacking them.

Why don't they ever shut the doors in the house? There are ways to make doors near silent if you try, and you'd have a hell of a lot better chance getting your chores done and not having monster attacks if all your doors are shut.

Don't dig your baby hole directly under your water supply.

Then the grain silo sinking was a little past the point of belief. It was my underatanding that sinking in grain is only really a thing when the grain is flowing, not if its all compressed in the silo already with no way to get out. And then 2 seconds later they stop sinking despite pressure being applied to them?

dxiupaq,"I think this whole movie is an allegory for raising a disabled child. Everything in the house was tailored specifically to help the daughter avoid making noise, Lee makes repeated futile attempts to fix her disability, and the horror of bringing a baby into such a dangerous world is analogous to the decision many parents of disabled children have to face. Putting an infant in a box symbolized the potential neglect a new child would likely face as parents would need to divert their attention to the disabled child.

I work with children with autism and I couldn't help buy draw parallels between the families I work with and the family in this film. The child's disability makes the entire family's life infinitely more difficult. But that difficulty creates a family better prepared to face the hardships of the world. It's likely the family survives in large part because they've already learned ASL to communicate with their daughter before the invasion. 

The main underlying theme is that a parent's love is unconditional. No matter what a disabled child does, the parent typically manages to avoid resentment. In Lee's case he never really resented his daughter. He merely resented the fact that he couldn't better protect her. ",8a5qdo

e26lvmi,"Unfortunately as already pointed out in this thread the movie was just riddled with inconsistencies and terrible logic. The whole suspension of disbelief spiel just doesn't fly here because for there to be suspension of disbelief the movie needs to meet the viewer halfway instead of just saying things are like they are and we should accept the premise no questions asked.

FIRST of all how are these things ""INDESTRUCTIBLE"" as stated in the papers? they are primal organic creatures, they don't have access to any technology that could deflect high velocity projectiles or dampen explosions. No matter how though and ""armored"" they are, grenades, missiles, 50 CAL or any other high powered weaponry we have would kill them and that's that. 

SECONDLY how come all of the militaries in the whole world couldn't figure out to use sound based weapons? I read some comments saying that it needs to be a specific frequency and whatnot but, like, just the US has enough military research and development that it would take a week tops to figure what the frequency is and whatever else is necessary to make it work.

THIRDLY even if these things were slaughtering the human race nonstop 24/7 it would take MONTHS just for them to make a dent in the population. And since they don't have any technology i doubt they could ever kill anyone with access to bunkers and other secured buildings like all the military facilities the US probably has and other countries so there would never be any risk of us being wiped out and we'd have all the time in the world to figure out how to fight them. Even if you want to be pedantic and say people would have to leave the secured facilities to gather resources, the movie showed a family without all of that surviving for 400 days easy.

FOURTLHY why would you ever have kids in these circumstances??? And don't get me started with ""but how is humanity supposed to survive and prosper if people just give up"" that's just a retarded hail mary attempt to explain things in a dumb movie.

And lastly if sounds can be masked by other sounds and the monsters are so easy to fool how would they ever be successful killing machines in a big metropolis like NY or London? they probably kill a few people sure, but there would be so many sounds coming from all directions (people screaming and crying, cars, planes, buses, motorcycles, pets, rain, gunshots, running, etc...) that they would mostly lash out at random and miss or just hit inanimate objects effectively wasting a lot of time and energy (they are still ""animals"" that need to eat and sleep right?).

Overall a 5/10 where all the points lost were due to laziness on the writers part and the worldbuilding. ",8a5qdo
dzfmhur,"OK, So I've been waiting a while to see this, well, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. 

1) Why leave a clearly irresponsible teenage daughter in a shop to look after a young brother who clearly doesn't understand that noise means death.  
2) Why would the family be walking home with the youngest kid trailing the rear, The dad would have been at the back of the pack watching out.    
3) Where did all that damn sand come from to lay hundreds of meters of path?      
4)Why were they living in a house full of noise traps, Glass framed photos lining the hall waiting for someone to knock off.    
5) For a supposedly sensible woman , why the hell would she forcefully tug on the laundry bag to expose that nail, IT was obviously stuck. That's not how a normal person responds.    
6) Why after standing on the nail, did she not go back later and make it safe?  
  7) All those lights and radio equipment is being driven by what electricity source? I certainly don't think they have a silent generator and clearly too much power involved for solar.    
8) with all that electricity, why are they playing games with a gas lantern for light?
  
9)Where did all the crops come from and who planted them in such a straight way without machinery.    
10) Where did the monsters come from?    
11) Why not use sound as bait to lure beasties in to a trap of sorts?  
12) why not have Noise alarms all over the fields, trip wires with bells/cans attached would trigger when near and confuse the beasties.  
13)Go Find a tank?  
14)why not live behind the waterfall if it's so safe there.  
15) Why the hell did they think getting pregnant was a good idea and surely the act of getting pregnant may have been noisey itself. Was there really no contraceptive available?    
16)Why did the kids think it would be safe inside the truck when they ha not 2 minutes earlier seen the beasty basically walk through the side of a silo. Although it now seems to have a problem with a truck cab.  
17) why did the dad not distract the monster by throwing stones around the place.  
18)Why did the dad leave the wife so close to her to due date? Surely he could have planned a little better. Did they really need fresh fish or were the stores out of tinned salmon?  
19) why did the kid have to keep the hearing aid actually in her ear for it to be effective, Obviously it could still be on while not rammed into her own ear.  
20) Salt, pretty sure a line of salt around the house would have fucked those bad boys up pretty good. They certainly looked sluggy to me. Or even good ol fashion Rick Roll them from a distance. 

For all of the above annoyances, I did actually enjoy the movie, but because it had such a promising premise, the above annoys me more. I'd score it a 6/10, Mainly for the acting, Although I was screaming for the young girl to get eaten after 10 mins. I am holding out for another film due at the end of the year which may have a similar premise called [""Bird Box""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2737304/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) based on the [book of the same name.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18498558-bird-box) Maybe that will fill the void that this film could have taken.

Why do people suddenly have no suspension of disbelief for science-fiction anymore? You know it's not supposed to be a documentary, right?

It's about a family and their unconditional love for each other in a harsh, unforgiving world. That's the only part of the film that needs to be represented with honesty. The rest is constructed to support that heart of the film. That's how themes work.",8a5qdo

dx090u2,"Really enjoyed it. The world building, the tension, the creatures design. All good.

Didn't like the ending that much. Didn't ruin the movie at all.

The core concept just doesn't really work for me. Creatures don't seem particularly smart, they only hunt via noise. I think that's a weakness people would have exploited. Also not nearly enough distraction traps. How about a little drone with a noisemaker that just flies away from the house? The guy knows radio, electronics, etc...  ",8a5qdo
dx1umvl,I enjoyed the movie. The lack of sound did not make it boring at all. There was more to the movie than survival.

I don't see how military would have been depleted with all the underground bunkers we have.  Bullproof armor may work for small rounds but the military has much more than that.

Once they figured out sound is what caused it, shouldn't they have figured out a frequency to fuck them up with?

I thought it was good, but just that. The pregnancy scene was awesome and intense but aside from that i can't say i was really on the edge of my seat for a lot of the set ups. Take the lantern being knocked over in the trailer, i expected a lot more surprise ""mistake"" bits that humans make. I think revealing the monster too early was  a mistake. Maybe i'm too jaded but i didn't feel much stress or anything. 

The lack of logic for rules was also pretty rampant in the third act. And the ending left such a bad taste in my mouth. It was one of those endings that really made me down on the whole thing.

2. I know why it had to happen from a narrative standpoint, but WHYYYYYYYYY would you have a baby in that situation? I guess they feel guilty for having the kid die at the beginning of the film, but isn't bringing a child into that world just seems awful selfish to me.

- I really liked the choice of clothing, soft fabric that flows, but for every time a character covered their mouth to muffle the sound of hard breathing or whimpering I counldt help but think a scarf would help them immensely. Each family member with a scarf like clothing would give them a little better chance right?

- The fireworks were a great source of distraction, but that was the only one?? I thought for sure the keys in the car and the tractor were there to be turned on so the characters can run the only way!

I feel the impact of the movie will be greater on parents. It really amplifies the fears and struggles of protecting your family and making sure they wake up every day.
I don't understand the criticism of ""plotholes"". Sometimes a film has an abundance of information that weighs down pacing and becomes a detriment. I don't need to know what happened to the military and if they discovered the creatures weakness. Not knowing had zero impact on my enjoyment of the movie. Granted that is a story in itself, how the world reacted to the creatures and what happened? I don't get why some choose to let irrelevant core points influence their experience.

If it helps, there is every possibility that New Zealand has already discovered the weakness of the creatures and is in the process of liberating the world. Just a bit hard to let everyone know.",8a5qdo

Why not just constantly redirect them away from you? Setup some kind of beacon of sorts away from where you live that just plays loud music all day and distracts them.

Something I would expect from a guy like that would be to rig up noisemakers around the farm that can be triggered in that basement room. They already had the light system set up for when the farm was in danger, why not have little noisemakers scattered in the north, east, south and west sections that you can activate with a button press?

I feel like that's an oversight. Even tin cans strung around the farm to trip the monsters up and warn you if they're near.

I like to imagine myself in these situations. Here are some things I would do.

1. Setup a remotely controlled sound system a bit way off my property. I mean he had a lot of stereo/radio equipment. Anything happens, turn it on/off in bursts so that they cant find it and destroy it, but loud enough to make them go for it.

2. Warning lights?? PUT IT UP ON THE DAMN SILO OR A HIGH PLACE. What good is a warning light if you can only see if when you are right next to it?

3. I'd be living in the sound proof(ish) bunker unless I'm out and about full time if any noise can kill me tbh.

4. Perhaps making another kid wasnt the best idea. Shit happens is not an excuse in this case.

5. Seriously took over a year for someone to figure out that noise might be their weakness? That would literally be the first thing I'd try.

However, I wish my audience was more respectful. The whole front row was full of kids that were loud and obnoxious just to be loud and obnoxious. Yelling “Eww!!” when the mother and father kissed and giggling audibly during very silent moments.

The Nail: 

Where did it come from? 
 No one puts a singular nail on stairs that are painted to be stepped on, since it would be loud to hammer one in, why put it there, it wouldn't stop anything. 

Why wasn't it removed? 
 Hammering in a nail is one thing but removing it would be quiet. The noise it could cause would give good reason to remove it.

Why didn't she know it was there? 
The kids aren't allowed in the basement but the mother is. She and the father spend a lot of time there and if the nail hadn't caused a problem before then why would it cause one now?

I am in loce with this movie but i don't think they should make a second one BUT i do think a prequel would work with the movie following an average soldier just to kind of go in depth with the creatures, show what methods was used against them, what life was like when they first appeared and have the soldier die at somepoint obviously. Like the movie could take place in the one day and then be done with the series or maybe a comic or book. I'd be happy with that",8a5qdo

Its Krasinski’s best directing effort so far, but Millicent Simmons (from Todd Haynes’ overlooked Wonderstruck) is indisputably his secret weapon here. With less than 3 minutes of dialogue its a sound designers dream and an innovative approach to the home invasion creature feature. The family themes are propped up by Krasinski casting his real wife Emily Blunt. The $50 million debut is such a needed win for Paramount after their gambles with mother!, Downsizing and Annihilation didn’t pay off.

e3fqq1n,"Its was a decent movie, but the suspension of disbelief was perhaps too much? The world is a noisy place, putting some sand on the ground doesn't mean it goes away, you see various characters walk over stuff that would have made a noise, but for convenience they don't, from dried leaves to wooden floors. Also wait till a thorn goes through your foot. How sensitive are these creatures? Its like you sneeze inside a room and they are already knocking? I don't think sound travels as far and the director want it to travel. 

Also why didn't they seem better prepared? I mean everyone should have some form of distraction device on them from fireworks to eggs timers. But alas they didn't. 

Also that lighting system was cool, I wonder if they could use it to remotely explode fireworks? Maybe have a bunch of these all around for such an occasion. Maybe make. 

Next why the fuck is the husband coming home at night? To a pregnant wife? Really? My brain, I can't. Also why is she even pregnant? I mean the world they live in is pretty bad with 2 brats, I don't think we need a 3rd even more vulnerable crying brat. 

Also the weird thing I noticed was how on the whiteboard there were apparently only 3 in the area? That's not much. Weird I was expecting more. And how big is the area they are covering? 

Also the obvious, yes the military who have made short work of these creatures, I'm sure they would make a lot of noise doing it too. 

Also its nice to see that shop looked pretty well stocked, I guess there aren't many people around. so you basically use it like a normal shop, take what you need now and come back later if you need more, the shop is open 24/7. :)

Others mentioned good points like building near the river, don't know what that didn't work or better yet, find a way to play the sound of the river near your house? 

edit: I have to say I laughed at such an inopportune time, when the husband finds the wife after she gives birth and the babe is neatly wrapped in the blanket, like here's your baby, as if a bunch of doctors helped to deliver the baby then disappeared before the next scene.

Speaking of which - the AC was on and for some reason really loud, it's how I imagine tinnitus to feel, you just slowly get used to it and that sound becomes your ""silence"". Two more bros walked in 20 minutes into the movie, then someone near the back took a picture of the screen with their flash on (really?) and to top it all off - the worst offender - they played Rampage in the screen next to ours, I only know because I could hear Dwayne Johnson and his gorilla pal through the god damned walls.

I would have found it more believable for a kid his age to be killed because he couldn't restrain himself from screaming or talking loudly. If he'd survived that long it meant he understood to stay absolutely silent, even when angry or upset. I could imagine his fear of the monsters around him would be what kept him silent for that long. That's why even though I know the rocket was an important plot point, for him to just be playing loudly with it while acting oblivious seemed so unbelievable. Just having him throw it in fear and start crying that he was sorry once he realized how noisy it was would have made the scene more heart wrenching and believable. 


I overall liked the movie but I felt there were too many cheap jump scares. I guess that's their whole schtick, what with being such a quiet movie- but sudden loud noises after dead silence being the main source of tension takes away some of the enjoyment for me.

The monster is presumably on the top of the food chain since it wiped out a huge chunk of the human population, but if its prey takes a step to the left and doesn't make a noise the monster misses a meal?

In the interviews Krasinksi and Blunt have constantly described this film as a love message to their kids, as to what parents would do to protect their family. It is a family movie in an apocalyptic setting.

2. Deafening use of silence and void of sound puts us in the shoes of the characters and influences the audience to hold their breath along with the characters, enhancing the tense moments further.",8a5qdo

dy4ca8j,"I agree with a lot of the comments about plotholes. The biggest for me were the bare feet. Socks, moccasins, slippers, valenki - there are a lot of sound-reducing footwear options.

I just couldn't focus when the entire family was wearing sweaters and winter coats and knit caps but no shoes - you'd get frostbite and be hissing in pain every time you stepped on a stone, which happens a hell of a lot in wooded farmland. 

That said I do think it was a huge directorial feat to be able to tell a story with no dialogue in a way that feels contemporary and coherent. Yes, a lot of story aspects were weak, but that felt like weak writing, not weak directing. I really wish the story structure had been stronger, and that the daughter had been given a more complete arc. There should have been a bigger conflict between her and the father so the audience understood quickly that she thought he didn't love her and that he thought she couldn't take care of herself, which would have given more tension to the scene where she saves her brother in the silo and the father sacrificing himself.",8a5qdo

dxebopc,"I loved all the world building and showing how the family lived. No shoes, sand trails, fuzzy board game pieces, sign language. Fireworks, a celebratory object, used as a last resort to escape death. There were also those painted marks on the wooden floorboard, which I assume marked which parts wouldn't creak when stepped on. Mom and son share a humorous moment, yet they can't laugh out loud. It's also interesting to consider that this family in particular had a survival advantage since they likely already knew sign language, what with having a deaf daughter.

However the more I think about the movie's internal logic, the less it seems to make sense and be a little too convenient or inconvenient for the sake of the plot. If something so much as playing Monopoly is enough to attract the monster, wouldn't snoring, coughing, sneezing, farting, or relieving oneself be a death sentence? Why don't they have more precautions like soundproofed windows or rooms? There were also liabilities all over the house. They had picture frames hanging on the walls everywhere; one loose nail (no reference intended) and they're all dead. Why not take the frames down? If the waterfall is basically a safe haven from the monster (you can SCREAM and nothing will happen), not to mention also a source of fish, why not set up a camp next to it? And that baby. How is that baby not crying or making more noise? They survived thanks to the soundproof shower? The monster couldn't hear the baby making noises while less than 10 feet away? Why didn't the firework attract all 3 of the monsters to begin with? How did the monster tear through the silo like nothing, yet be unable to tear through the truck? ~~How'd they start up the truck and drive away noiselessly?~~ Why did the kids have so much trouble with sinking into the grain at first, then not have any problems at all while the monster was attacking them? How'd the monster even know where the main dude was and be able to slash him?

Also, the ending was a bit lackluster IMO. The final showdown was pretty tedious and boring. That final cut with the shotgun cock also felt like a cheesy B-movie move, although it did get a laugh out of me. 

I realize a lot of this is kinda nitpicky, and some would argue these details aren't the point of the movie. But for something that takes itself so seriously from the start about making any kind of noise, the world and the character's behaviors don't quite make sense. I can only suspend my belief so much. Maybe I'm being nitpicky because I had high hopes for this movie and IMO it just barely misses the mark on being amazing. 

Overall I did enjoy the movie. It was a very innovative premise for a movie that made for a unique quiet theater experience. It certainly has me thinking a lot about how I'd survive, and what life would be like in general, in a world where I couldn't make any noise. There were just a lot of noticeable rough edges that could've been improved. ",8a5qdo
dxdxyv5,"Fun movie. My brother described it as a 90 minute long version of the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park which I think is an apt description. I’ll just share some quick thoughts. 

The grain silo scene was definitely a stand out. Something about being sucked down into grain or sand is really horrifying. 

The creature design was pretty disappointing. The quasi-human, faceless Cloverfield monster is a Hollywood staple at this point, and I think it needs to go. It’s fine for a television show like Stranger Things, but there has to had to have been other designs pitched to Krasinki and co that were rejected in favor of the one we got. 

I’m trying not to think too hard about the world itself, but things do kind of fall apart when you start asking questions. Did nobody stop to think that maybe a creature with extremely acute hearing might be sensitive to loud or high frequencies? Do people that snore get wiped out first? Why in God’s name would you have a child with these things around? But these are just plot contrivances and not plot holes. The family’s situation is believable. 

Overall a solid flick, but I think a meta critic score of 82 is a bit too high. It’s not particularly memorable, and the concept of being hunted relentlessly by an all but unstoppable creature isn’t a new concept. This is no Alien. Hell, there was a Black Mirror episode with this very concept this past season and that episode might be just a bit better since that episode does a better job of establishing a sense of dread at the notion of being relentlessly hunted down. In addition, the movie is just a bit too reliant on jump scares for my taste. 

All in all, it’s a great first outing for Krasinski. The acting was good, kids were great. Sound design was also really good. Helped play up the tension in a lot of scenes. I really like John Krasinki and glad that he’s really managed to break out of the role of being Jim from the Office. ",8a5qdo
dxdyp2r,"Was anybody else a little bothered by the scene where the dad sacrificed himself? 

Why didn't he immediately go to the car to hide with his kids? Why did he stop to pick up a shovel when even guns can't pierce the armor of the monsters? How did the monster know he was standing there the first time it attacked him when he was being relatively quiet? Also, instead of yelling to make noise to save his kids, he could have picked up the shovel and thrown it at a nearby pole or other surface to make noise at another location.

It just seemed like he didn't have to yell and cause his own death.  I know that it was what the movie was building up to, but the sacrifice didn't come organically and it could have been executed better.",8a5qdo
dxr2jd4,"The biggest flaw in the film is that in order for Emily Blunt's character to be pregnant someone would have had to have sex with her without making a sound, which is absurd.  ",8a5qdo
dy5vxym,"This felt like a movie where the director/actor were simply showcasing their talent. It's like 'see we made a movie without dialog.' The acting was great, but the story was kept simple to tell the story. However, my problems with it weren't simply that the actors were not talking. It was with the lack of real conflict. Conflict included: The kid died, everyone blames themselves/each other, the end or the big monsters are killing us, we hide or die, we figure out their weakness, the end. 

I'll accept that the parents let their kids roam free in this ultra\-sound sensitive world including their deaf child who cannot possibly know what actions make what noises or their very young child who has not yet seen the consequences of making too much noise. I'll also accept that the father who is capable of designing makeshift cochlear implants and a network of security cameras is incapable of designing remote speaks around the woods to distract the monsters. I'll even accept the irresponsibility of having another child to replace the one you lost. However, at some point you stand back and realize you are making a hundred different concessions to allow the plot to go forward. 

Maybe I'm being too harsh. However, if this were my story. I'd have considered the most effective way to survive and cover how **EVEN** that will fail due to human error. Read a book like 'Bird Box,' which is coming out on Netflix I think and it demonstrates the militant way a family goes about dealing with a similar situation. >!They cannot open their eyes without going crazy.!<

You can look at The Walking Dead for another example of what people deal with in these scenarios. Vigilance keeps you alive, but you can only keep a group of people vigilant for so long. The main characters are vigilant occasionally, and occasionally they just allow their children to roam free.  I mean why doesn't everyone carry a kitchen timer with them at the very least? Or [these?](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/qPIAAOSwcexZoWR4/s-l300.jpg)

Overall, John and Emily were brilliant I thought. The daughter was okay, and the son made some hilarious faces. The story lacked oomph and I was only semi\-invested in the fate of the characters as a result. For example, when the dad sacrifices himself I was not really concerned. We got only a little piece of who that dad was because of the truncated story.

Edge of your seat suspense. Great direction. Just a great movie all around. 

I'm very glad that they made the movie about *creatures* with well-defined physical properties, and not the door-slamming ""spirits"" that inhabit movies like The Conjuring, Insidious, or Paranormal Activity. A physical threat is almost always so much scarier and easier to relate to than a threat with no defined or well understood properties or goals. 

From the trailers, I thought the movie looked great, but I was somewhat worried that the monsters might have been some sort of other dimensional ghosts or some crap. But I'm glad that wasn't the case.

Things I did not like about the movie: 

[One of the most frustratingly disappointing endings I've seen in a long time. Really felt like an incomplete story. Even open ended movies like Inception are not as frustrating as this.](#spoiler)

Throughout the movie, I was thinking ""wow, this is probably the best film I've seen all year"" and then the ending happened. And now I'm not sure how I feel about it. 

Minor nitpicks: 

It seems like there would be many different ways for an intelligent advanced society to easily deal with these honestly quite dumb creatures. 

There's never any real confirmation about what's going on in big cities. But it almost feels like the movie implies that this is a post-apocalyptic world and most of the population has been wiped out. 

The creatures had huge ears that the camera zoomed up to, as if to imply that the creatures had super hearing. Yet they didn't actually seem to have hearing better than a human. They were numerous times shown in situations where they failed to locate their prey, yet a normal human ear would easily be able to hear the deep breathing and the movements of the family. 

The idea that an animal whose only major sense is the sense of hearing, yet it can't echolocate is somewhat hard to believe. Even blind humans can echolocate. 

Couldn't the humans just have set off those fire works every single time the creatures came close. Or a car alarm. Or thrown a glass bottle really far away? Or literally anything? 

I feel like they would be much more safe in a LOUD place than in a quiet place. 

I can't imagine how *ineffective* these creatures would have been in a place like New York City. 

It seems like a simple solution would be for the military to lure the creatures into a cave or cage or something and then lock them in, even if they were bulletproof. 

It also seems like [high pitch frequencies](#spoiler) hurting the creatures or making them vulnerable would be discovered almost immediately in a loud military setting. That's almost as simple as water from ""Signs"". 

But these are just minor ""cinema sins"" style nitpicks. 

I like to think maybe the government/military was in the process of easily slaughtering these aliens, and this family was just stuck out in the middle of nowhere. ",8a5qdo
dx83g5n,"This is the sort of movie where you just need to suspend your disbelief for the sake of the plot.

Otherwise how do you explain that:

1. The monsters can hear relatively soft sounds like glass breaking (compared to, say, a gunshot) from a great distance and come running.

2. They seem to echo locate, hence all the clicking.

3. They're capable of running *very* fast through woods without hitting trees, always seem to find the door instead of crashing into a wall, and can navigate steps.

4. And yet they can't easily detect a human silently standing ten feet away.

Again, **they can avoid running into trees and walls, but can't detect people who don't make blatant noise.**",8a5qdo
dxdpclq,"Considering they didn't eat their kill, one would have to assume that the area would wreak a stench due to all the dead being strewn about. I realize its not relevant tto the plot or movie, but i couldn't help wondering during that during the movie. Either way despite the nitpicking on this board, this was a good movieconsidering it's originallity. Can't remember a movie where the whole theater was completely quiet. I was lucky considering everyone else's experience.",8a5qdo
dxejxh3,What a great movie to get kids to practise safe sex. ,8a5qdo
dz6bq8a,"So many questions: 

-Why would blind creatures evolve to randomly attack sudden noise without knowing what's making that noise?  What if it's a bigger species?  Or a natural phenomenon?  Do the monsters waste precious energy attacking lightning strikes, thunder claps and avalanches?

-Why don't survivors just keep old beer cans or basketballs on their persons that they could throw 20 feet away to distract the monsters?  If you accidentally make a sound that attracts a monster throw a ringing egg timer away from you and the monsters will leave you alone.  

-Why not dig a flaming pit with a siren tethered over it as bait to lure the monsters to their own firey destruction, or put a boombox on a table surrounded by electrified water (like a bug zapper but with sound instead of light)?



-The monsters are supposedly invincible due to armor but they have highly sensitive and exposed eardrums when attacking.  Why can't you set an egg timer, wait for a monster to attack it, silently point a rifle at its pulsating eardrum, pull the trigger, and then throw another ringing egg timer 20 feet away from you so you can escape?

-How do you grow your own food for over a year without making a sound?  Just shoveling and breaking up dirt could be loud enough to attract attention.",8a5qdo

dx1p0mi,Better than Signs.  Kept my interest in spite of the lack of dialogue.  Not sure how well this plays outside of the cinema or for repeat viewings.  Very handsome and stylish family if somewhat out of place.  The family looked straight out of a J. Peterman catalog.  I suppose it's important to stay stylish even when society has been decimated by invincible aliens.  Worth a matinee or Movie Pass.  ,8a5qdo
dx2ymgg,"I know come folks have some issues with the movie, but looking back there are lots of little things that make me really love the movie. Like when I got home and went to open and close my front door I tried to do it quietly... then I remembered they didn't have doors on their dwellings. They had leafs and stuff on the floor because sweeping them out would be possibly too loud. Lee had notes on his board that we saw evidence of being used (Medieval skills and tech made me chuckle). The family had corn and other veggies being grown and grain saved for further planting and making bread. 

The old man in the forest took me by surprise, until I realized he had two reasons to scream. One was to help the father and son get away and two being he had clearly just lost his wife and didn't want to live anymore. 

Also, I think the wife may have been in the medical profession. She knew the medicine her son would need and was keep track of her health, that or she had been reading medical books. 

As far as the ""dumb"" moments: Beau was a 3-4 year old kid, what happened was the decision making of a 3-4 year old. Lee's final action in the film- he had a gash from those huge claw and probably multiple borken bones. He didn't have many options other than what he chose to do. Why didn't the family have more noise makers etc etc? Well it's been nearly a year and a half, they may  have used them numerous times already. Also, they weren't expecting the situation that arose due to early birth and the old man in the woods. How did it come to this for the world? Well, that's just it, we don't get to know. For all we know millions or billions landed on earth and started wreaking havoc. Or maybe they were just attack dogs of a superior race that did the real damage. We only get enough info to know that they popped up when governments existed and now they are in every major area he checked on the radio. Also, they seem to have a natural ability to dim electricity. Maybe they cause tanks to not work properly. 

I thought it was a good enough film. I didn't have a hard time to suspended my disbelief enough to enjoy the show. ",8a5qdo

dx60m4a,"Overall I enjoyed it, but I left the theater with a bunch of questions.

I think if they had kept the time line at day 90 I could've understood a lot of the decisions and revelations. 

The mom would have been pregnant from before the event. Do condom wrappers make too much noise? 

The initial child death could have been the family learning their lesson on how to stay quiet. 

The incomplete soundproof room would have been more forgivable. 

The lack of any decent counter measures. They had some fireworks hooked up, but that was kind of it. They had tons of stuff still hanging on walls, no carpets, no firecrackers or anything noisy to throw?

MAYBE INSTEAD OF PUTTING LIGHTS ALL AROUND YOU COULD HAVE PUT SPEAKERS MUCH MORE USEFUL. where's the fucking army? You've failed again USA.

 Dad, they just escaped the monster being too close with it, don't they already know the rules. Like that, every scene, so many times this gesture was shown as if the characters aren't aware of it.

Another thing that annoyed me was, the daughter. The father is at least trying to make something work for her, t his little shit has an attitude issue after killing the brother with her stupidity. What an entitled, ungrateful piece of shit. The brother tells her that, lets wait for the dad, he will come for us. She decides, no we have to leave now from the safest place on that area.

dwzmjmo,"Every nitpick about ""why didn't they do this or this or this"" is easy to actually debunk if you think about how they had to basically exist in this world and the time and resources they had to work with. Scavenging and looking for animals for food takes time. They were basically building and improving the living standards and their means of survival as they went. You as a viewer need to take the leap of faith and just understand ""ok they clearly did what they could with what they had"" and you are viewing at a point in time where they haven't gotten to that point yet. It was a little over a years worth of time. I see a lot of people saying ""why didn't they build a house near the river?"" How do you expect them to do that? Think about how much noise and travel would be involved with tools and materials. They are still talking at a low volume when they are around the waterfall. ""Why did they have a baby that's so stupid!"" Yeah I personally would have talked with my wife about giving her a nice uppercut to the stomach to save us the trouble but I'll bet everything I own that in this scenario there are actual people out there who are so pro-life that they would choose to have that baby in that world. Maybe in their minds its ""GODS PLAN"". They do show them holding hands for grace/possibly prayer at dinner. Maybe the mother is so distraught about the loss of one of her children this is how she decided to cope, who knows... But you as the viewer are supposed to accept that this family got pregnant and they chose to take that risk because they felt it was right. Also, Jim's character (yeah I called him Jim, fite me) was clearly working his ass off to build and create the things they needed. He was preparing the sound proof room and improving it as they went. She had the baby before her expected due date so once again maybe they had much bigger aspirations and a plan that didn't work out as best as it could have. He clearly thought his daughters hearing was a major impairment in this world and slaved away at creating a device to help her hear. Only so much time to MacGyver all the shit you guys suggest and protect and surive. Just saying I feel it's easy to take the leap of faith with this movie and people who nitpick this one are just dipshits who don't know how to enjoy a movie that was actually presented VERY VERY well.    ",8a5qdo
dxcgy5k,"Some critics of this film have claimed there is little or no characterization. I’m going to provide an in-depth analysis for each character to demonstrate that those criticisms are false. I’ll go in order of importance to the overall film. Before you start this wall of text, I want to emphasize the fact that a 90 minutes movie with barely a page of spoken dialogue was capable of sparking this much discussion. Enough information is given throught visual storytelling alone that I was literally able to write a 1500 word essay simply analyzing and contextualizing each character’s behaviors. This is the *reason* A Quiet Place is a good movie. It passes the show-don’t-tell test with flying colors. 

First character is rocket kid since there’s the least to say about him. He is a 3.5 to 4 year old boy. His cardinal trait is naivety. The opening shots of the film suggest that Regan (the daughter) is generally responsible for supervising him when their parents are otherwise occupied. We see from his bed linens as well as his actions in the store that he likes space. Being a child, he falsely convinces himself that a rocketship will protect them from the monsters because there are no monsters in space. Many will think this is stupid, but I work with children of that age for a living and it’s a believable line of thinking for a child that age. We get a dramatic scene where every member of the family essentially shirks their responsibility in a way that’s relevant to their character; father assumes his son will listen which his actions later in the film suggest he no longer makes these types of assumptions, the mother embraces him for a moment then leaves making the same naïve assumption as her husband, the daughter attempts to playcate the boy because she wants him to be happy, and the older son is helpless through this whole sequence of events. His death is the catalyst of all the major internal conflicts all the characters face for the rest of the film and symbolizes the death of all of their innocence.

dxsxjk8,"I thought it was interesting how very conservative this movie was tonally. This isn't to attack the film, I actually liked it a lot, just haven't seen a review mention it yet.

It was a movie about a rural white family persecuted by monsters who attack them when they speak. They say grace before they eat. The vulnerability of a pregnant mother is an important plot device. The father is a traditional masculine figure, who deeply cares for his family and is self-sufficient and independent. Fertility was a prominent theme.

&nbsp;

1) At the start of the movie, it was less than 3 months since the aliens came to earth and caused massacre. Then how come the town had no dead bodies or blood splatters anywhere. Surely many people would have been killed in the initial moments and there was no possibility of a clean-up crew to do anything.

&nbsp;

2) Why would the parents leave the youngest child unattended so many times even when he recently did a stupid thing (and who is most capable of doing something stupid)? They also leave him in the back of the line where no one can keep any eye on him. This was the weakest plot point for me.

&nbsp;

3) Why take a trek to the pharmacy to get the meds and eat there only when needed? Why not get a small stock of necessary meds wrapped in a paper or cloth and keep at home with proper markings?

&nbsp;

4) We see that there were still some small animals present in the area. What happened to all the birds in the area? Just a bunch of birds making noise and flying away when the aliens came would have kept the aliens busy. Similarly noisy insects like crickets, cicadas etc.

Afaik a feedback loop can only exist in two basic scenarios... a) one mic + one speaker, and the mic feeds into the speaker (which then feeds back into the mic), and the feedback is triggered when they are moved into close enough proximity, or b) a daisy chain with at least two mics + two speakers... Mic A feeds to Speaker A which feeds into Mic B which feeds to Speaker B and back to Mic A and so on. You can observe this effect by calling a phone nearby and putting them both on speakerphone. 

Now... In the movie, the daughter's hearing aid has a mic + a speaker. But this is not an example of scenario A because the hearing aid doesn't trigger a feedback loop on its own. Plus the feedback is omly triggered by an alien's proximity so thus must be an example of Scenario B right? 

Wrong. 

It has a mic (ears).  But no speaker. *It can make noises*, you say, *so it has a speaker.*

Not the same. For the feedback loop to work the speaker would have  to function as an immediate relay of what's input through the mic. We don't really see this immediate-relay mechanism in nature (probably because of feedback loops) and I think it's safe to say the aliens in a Quiet Place are not intended to have an immediate-relay speaker.

Do we just chalk this down to negligence or does someone else see a way the feedback could work? ",8a5qdo
dwzlj05,"I had some problems with the story:


The monster can’t hear a baby, that is less than a foot away, crying over a waterfall but can hear a small sound that is outside the house and is hundreds of feet away over the same waterfall?

And it can tear through a metal corn silo with no effort but struggles with a car roof?

And why, in two years, has nobody ever thought to overwhelm its hearing?

And why would they have a baby? In a world where you need silence why would you create a loud, unpredictable human? I understand you have needs, and maybe you don’t have protections, but there are other ways.

And why wouldn’t you live in that soundproof room where you can actually converse and make noise?",8a5qdo

You watched a movie and you either liked it or didn't.

I'm not saying they're aren't outliers, I'm 26 and I liked it. A very good tense creature feature thriller that is almost an allegory for what life  is like having a disabled child (deaf girl). The acting was superb especially on Emily Blunts part. Yet there are people shitting on it because ""WHY DIDNT THEY JUST DO ETC."" Thats not good critisism. I just feel like there's a bunch of teenagers on here who wouldn't know a good, well made movie if it bit them in the ass.

Here’s what I did not like about it.: SPOILERS

There were so many logical inconsistencies. Did no one think to lure the creatures with sound and trap them somewhere? Are they completely indestructible to everything? I could imagine luring the creatures and using a high powered explosive on them. 

A creature that senses everything purely through sound and no one thought to blare different frequencies at them? And how does a deaf girl survive all this? I would think a deaf person would be less likely to survive considering they don’t know when they make a noise. Then there’s the stupidity of having a baby during all this.

Anyway, to me, the premise didn’t make sense and that’s why I didn’t enjoy the movie overall. ",8a5qdo

* Beau's death in the beginning: This made me think of Georgie's in It. Totally unexpected, haunting in how gruesome it is, setting the tone for the movie. I really like how this was in the trailer, thinking it's some false alarm and that he will live, but BAM.

Let me re\-iterate, I enjoyed the movie and I'd like to watch it again.

[I love the sand trails, I love the mobile made of cloth, the Monopoly pieces made of cloth. But it was these details that made me rethink every relative sound in the entire film. Knocking over a glass lantern in the basement can make a monster from an unknown distance run to kill you, but putting a mattress over the basement door and talking is ok? If the water in the river was so loud why didn't they just talk there?  If I can't play monopoly in a basement with regular pieces without a monster eating me what makes me think I can walk through tall grass in the night? Why aren't the monsters attacking the wind in the trees? I know its nit\-picky,](#spoiler) but there were a lot small sound things that really took me out of the movie because of the uneven portrayal of what could get you killed and what couldn't. 

Portrayal of time took me out of it as well. I understood that Kransinski kept the passing of time oblique in the same way time passes in The Shining, but there were other moments in the film such as [the flooding of the basement and the birth](#spoiler) that seemed to happen WAY too quickly. I feel like they rushed the edit in fear of a longer running time.

Also, I know i'm being petty but [the writing on the dry erase boards ""MONSTERS \- ARMOR, ATTACK SOUND..."" ""SURVIVE"" ""HOW MANY? 3??"" etc, seemed a little too on the nose. I understand it's show don't tell, using the scenery to tell the story, etc...](#spoiler) but to me it was transparently a storytelling tool more than a realistic set piece. The family already knows all that information, [they don't need big writing on the wall to tell them the monsters attack sound.](#spoiler)

Plot wise, I'm sure I'm missing something. But I don't know what to take away from the movie besides \- ""cool idea"". The tone seemed to call for the audience to take it more seriously by wrapping the idea with themes of loss and family, but in the end the movie really seemed like a series of action set pieces with no real lasting effect on the plot or characters. The stakes seemed really high, and with no real reward. One of my film professors always said to give your movie the ""so what?"" test. After it's all over ask, ""so what?"" , what's the point? I'm not sure this film has a strong answer to that.

Was the point [to cure his daughter's hearing? To survive? To have the baby? It didn't feel like any of those was the main plot point if so. To be a harsh, the whole concept of the film feels like it was a college film student idea with Hollywood execution. *""What if there were monsters that killed you based on sound, and the main character walks barefoot on sand""*](#spoiler) It is a cool concept, and I'm glad the film exists, but i don't think that it is fully realized and I can't shake the image of them coming up with the idea while smoking weed on the couch. The movie's strengths are the small world building details but without a spine it is the small things that are also the weakness. They don't have a core to stem from. I understand in this monster ridden world the characters want to live, live happily and safely, the parents want to care for their kids \- but they chose a home to stay at, with all sorts of safety systems and alarms...to live ""happily ever after""? Was it safe until the events of the movie? What is the point? Are the monsters the point? So what?

After the movie was over I was actually thinking about how it could fit really nicely in a ""Alien / Aliens"" original to sequel scenario, especially given the last couple shots of the movie. I think an action sequel could erase some of the specific problems I had with the film and focus the strengths of the film into key scenes \- not to mention build the world a little more. 

Again, I liked the movie. But I suppose i'm being a tough critic because the movie was hyped up and I like the idea, John Krasinksi and Emily Blunt.

 I also feel that I could see it again and think everything I just said was thinking too harsh. Maybe its just a popcorn movie. Maybe it's not supposed to be deep and I'm overthinking it, but by presentation I left feeling like I was supposed to get more out of it and for me there was more to be desired.",8a5qdo

dx26kc0,"As to why no one in the whole world has tried high frequency noises before, I think the movie makes it perfectly clear that the aliens have an armour that, as stated in one of the headlines in the basement, is indestructible. It’s very safe to assume that these armours also block high frequency sounds too and kept closed tight during the beginning of the world invasion, when the world was a much louder place and the aliens didn’t need their acute hearing while lots of scientists probably have tried all kinds of sound weapons before dying.

It’s shown in various scenes that they only expose their “ears” when in complete silence, which may answer the question of them not hearing heavy breathing, heartbeats, bowel movements and any other human body noise.",8a5qdo

dxxgwdt,"I can't usually handle horror movies but my love of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt convinced me to finally see this. I was somewhat underwhelmed.

Pros:

-	acting was great
-	there were some very cool directing choices, such as the difference in sound when we went into the daughter's perspective
-	it has some good jumps cares if you're into that sort of this (I am not but to each their own)

Cons:

-	the story: We knew he still loved his daughter, so that scene where he tells her didn't carry as much weight for me. That entire plotline is the only major one in the movie (other than ""don't make sound or you might die"") and I thought they could've come up with something better. At the very least tell the story of the son who dies like halfway through the film as a flashback so at least we're attached to *some* of the on-screen characters when they experience this tragedy.
-	the PLOT HOLES: this movie does a good job of explaining certain things, such as how if a louder sound is made nearby it will draw the alien away from whatever sound it just heard, but in explaining things like this it makes us expect explanations for the rest of the 'rules' of the film, and it comes up short. If there are (at least) three aliens in the area, why are they only able to focus on one sound at a time? Can't they split up? And if they do hunt in herds why every time we see an attack does only one alien actually attack? Why do the kids use cotton Monopoly pieces if cooking dinner, a louder task for sure, is perfectly okay sound-wise? How do they have electricity if civilization is all but gone? Do they have a generator? If so, those make a *lot* of noise, so why hasn't it been found and destroyed by the aliens? If the waterfall masks other sounds, why not build a house near the waterfall? Why on Earth would they risk all of their lives by having a baby? Who would want to bring a child into this world? I know they had a bunker and everything, but babies are very loud all the time. Did they plan to leave the baby on noxious gas forever? Too many questions and too few answers.

I know that if a race of monsters invaded the world and hunted using sound, I would have an abundance of noise making devices at my disposal to use as distractions. I'd have walkie-talkies set up so that I could lure the monsters far away. I'd have alarm clocks and speakers all over the places to use as decoys in case of emergency. Or hell, I'd just constantly have white noise playing all around me so that it would drown out my own sounds. They establish that the monsters ignore constant noises like rivers, after all. Also, why not live right near that waterfall? And if there were other groups of survivors all around, why not all live together and really fortify yourselves? And you're really telling me that even though we have sonic weaponry in existence now, nobody else in the world has thought to use it against these creatures? It also really bothered me that the movie made a point of saying the creatures were impervious to bullets, and yet the one at the end was killed using a bullet. I know its armour was opened up, but surely if a whole army was shooting at these things, some of them would have died.

dxexpmz,"Ok, here's my take.

Why didn't they create places filled with sounds to confuse the monsters? It's not hard to build a system with multiple sources where you can't pin point the origin. People would only need noise canceling headphones and/or earplugs to survive.

Nobody tried rotating sound frequencies? Even the military people and scientists living inside bunkers after a year and a half?

Helicopters + snipers aiming at their ears?

Now on to the family: they had a large and complex light system to turn red, but no button to turn on something that makes sound and send the monsters away?

So did anyone else notice the great Jurassic Park (and Aliens) references used in the film?

1. The basement water scene where the only thing that separates Emily Blunt from the monster was the waterfall. This type of shot was amazing and used in JP 2 after the T-Rex chase. And also a nod to Aliens. All three of these movies used a close quarters face-face interaction between the character and monster in a masterfully suspenseful way.

2. (and my favorite) was when the monster was attacking the kids in the truck. Jurassic Park heavily focused on the idea that the T-Rex's vision was based on movement, while this movie the monsters were based off sound. In JP when the T-Rex is attacking the vehicle to get at Lex and Tim, Alan Grant used a flare to distract Rexy, while Jim Halpert in this movie used his voice at risk to his own life to save the kids. #spoiler",8a5qdo

My two nitpicks are that the trailer did end up showing too much... Just from watching that I knew that kid was going to die. Also, with the solution at the end where using super loud, high frequency sounds basically incapacitates the monsters... I feel like that would have been the logical next step for people to experiment with before the world got this bad and post-apocalyptic... That took me out just a little.",8a5qdo
dx33few,"I really loved this movie. I give the filmmakers credit for limiting the narrative to this contained story about a single family and their struggle in a corner of this dystopian vision. Oftentimes these types of movies will introduce extra characters and plot twists to pad out the story. But in this case they kept that stuff to a minimum, keeping the focus purely on this small cast of characters and the action that unfolds after they draw the attention of the monsters. From the moment Blunt’s character trips down the stairs (or arguably from the moment she pulls up the nail) it becomes a nonstop thrill ride (this phrase gets thrown around a lot but it’s fitting in this case) until the credits roll. And as the action unfolds each character has a satisfying arc. It’s such a simple story but beautifully executed.   

I also found it to be really refreshing in terms of how it avoided cliches we’ve seen a million times before. Not to say it doesn’t indulge in horror cliches. It’s easy to draw parallels to classics like Tremors, Alien, or dystopian survival flicks. But it doesn’t allow itself to get bogged down by certain tropes that have become something of a prerequisite in the genre. Like when they encountered the crazy old man in the woods. I was worried the story, in an attempt to shoehorn thematic weight, was about to go off on a tangent involving this geezer and beat us over the head with how the state of the world had brought out the worst in mankind. That sort of crap. I was actually relieved when he immediately offed himself, even if I was worried about Big Tuna’s safety in that moment.   

Another example is the baby. I was convinced there would be a moment where a character is forced to momentarily smother the baby in order to avoid detection, putting the infant’s fate in question. We’ve seen that sort of scene before. And it seems like such an obvious plot device in this film. Thankfully the film doesn’t go there, which seems fitting considering how the characters are portrayed as devoted parents first, survivalists second. To me, that sort of scene would have seemed like a cheap, manipulative attempt to make the film darker and more suspenseful. I was so relieved they didn’t go there. They didn’t need to. That baby was in plenty of danger to begin with.  

I’ve seen some complaints about strained plausibility, that people find it hard to believe these creatures could have wiped out so much of society before people could discover their weakness. I get where these complaints are coming from. But I would suggest trying to stretch your imagination a bit more. We’re only given a few basic facts about the monsters. They’re sensitive to sound. Bombs and guns don’t hurt them. And as we see, they’re incredibly fast and lethal. Think about it. Blunt’s character fired the shotgun once and we saw dozens coming for her. Now imagine a military base packed with tanks or jets. Or armed convoys of humvees and heavily armed soldiers. Those things are going to be loud. The military would probably be among the first to get wiped out. Foot soldiers won’t stand a chance. Tanks and jets will eventually run out of fuel. By the time scientists (the few who are still alive after the initial invasion) are able to discover the weakness, they’re going to be isolated from the rest of the world. How are they going to spread the word and disperse the equipment? How much of the military is still in tact at that point? Perhaps there are pockets of survivors who have discovered the weakness and are slowly fighting back.  

I’m not saying this is how it played out. All I’m getting at is that the backstory is vague enough that it allows the user to fill in some of the blanks. I enjoy that sort of thing. It’s not that difficult to imagine a scenario that could have lead to the world in this movie. Not to mention it’s a monster movie, so some suspension of disbelief is to be expected. ",8a5qdo

I suspect that these guys might as well have been biological weapons, administered by some other beings] (#spoiler).

As I see it, this movie is ultimately about the innate biological, human drive to survive, reproduce and persevere ([As is why I also see nothing illogical in the fact that they chose to have another child, which I have heard other people express as being dumb and unrealistic](#spoiler)) and what lengths humans will go when their family and/or loved ones are under threat.

dx02lbd,"Alright, just saw the movie, *cracks knuckles*, it's showtime:




* Why are they having a baby, which will scream and cry as babies are wont to do, in this world?
* Why are they leaving every door in the house open? Any sound they make inside would be heard outside? On top of that, the risk of a gust of wind knocking off whatever you have holding the door and slamming it shut seems greater than forgetting to gently shut a door.
* The creatures probably wander about even without the presence of sound, what if one of them casually finds their way in the house without them noticing?  Kid is doing their homework quietly and turns around and BAM, a monster there.  They would definitely stay quiet and not get eaten, yes.
* Also, the creatures are sensitive enough to hear the sound of breaking glass (and a scream) that has to make its way up out of the lab, bounce off all the wooden sound absorbing walls, go out of a door, and make it through a corn field.  Yet somehow walking and even running outside don't immediately get you killed.  No dead leaves to step on anywhere I guess?  Whimpering while in labor 3 feet away from a creature isn't enough either.
* So the creature can break out of a solid steel grain silo and rip through solid steel, but can't rip open a truck.  Also can't break the wooden floor to get the basement when they're in there with a loud baby.
* A mattress is the perfect door for your emergency basement, no need for anything better than that.  Hopefully a monster doesn't accidentally walk on it and fall through and manically tumble down into your hiding spot.
* When leaving the basement, why does the dad not notice the broken pipe 10 feet away from him gushing tons of water towards the entry?
* How did the creature get into the basement?  I thought for sure that mattress would keep them out.  Why would it go there anyway?  They were being quiet and there was white noise from running water outside.
* How are they getting electricity?  Don't tell me that little solar panel on the roof is powering the home, the surveillance station, and the hundred incandescent light bulbs outside.  If they are receiving electricity from a working power station, that raises so many other issues that I don't even want to list them all.
* If loud white noise is known to make it difficult for the creatures to track someone, why not use all that equipment to generate some throughout the property?  Certainly would take far less power than a hundred incandescent light bulbs.
* The creatures obviously have a weakness to a shotgun blast to the head.  Did no one else in the world figure this out?  Oh it's only possible to penetrate their armor by shooting the warm gooey center of their head when their sound sensor things on their head are extended?  Good news, an army firing lots of guns will probably make a lot of noise and cause those to be extended.
* No one else figured out that maybe they are sensitive to sound, and to maybe use sonic warfare against them?  Clearly when it was discovered that they hunt by sound, the world was still functional enough to print and disseminate lots of newspapers and magazines.  No government was able to capture one of these things and do some basic experiments on them to figure it out?
* So the old guy was not considerate enough to maybe wait for the people passing by to get to a safe distance before committing suicide out of grief????

I feel like the pregnancy felt contrived, but it adds much suspense to the movie and escalates the incoming danger that presented. Jump scares didn't feel too bad in the movie since the ones with the creatures you see them kind of coming. 

The ending was badass though. Made me feel like Emily Blunt is about to go Ripley in Quiet Places if there's a sequel. 

However, the movie does require a lot of suspense of disbelief because when you think more about the concept and lore it starts making you ask a bunch of questions. How were these creatures able to take over the world? What happens if you snore, sneeze, burp, etc? 

What happens if you let out a huge fart? ",8a5qdo
dx31b4y,"1) that was a small problem with the corn sinking thing. Technically spreading out your weight should keep from sinking but they didn’t really try hard to show that. Also the younger brother doesn’t have the strength to pull up the older sister so I don’t get the point of that. I was able to get past it because it wasn’t a problem with the world story and movies mess up physics all the time but you are right it’s a problem. 

2) the aliens are attracted by sound in general. The fireworks are a last resort as is the gun. The point is up until this time was not to use them at all because it would just attract more later. 

3) while I saw the father as dawdling around the axe I didn’t see him as going to specifically kill the alien, he was surveying his options. What I don’t like here is that the alien “sees” him when he’s being quiet. As a plot point I don’t like that they had to put the father in peril.  It was a great emotional scene but logically why was a guy doing just about everything perfect just standing around waiting to get mauled?  It was contrived. 

4) I dunno enough about farming to say if all that could be planted by hand or if it just regrows and they let it grow because the aliens only arrived 472 days ago. They clearly don’t need all that food since I saw no animals (they would have probably been killed by the aliens)

5) “get under ground” was one of the hints from the basement in the main house. This was a space under the barn where they brought the baby. You need to dig out more places underground. 

6) they are farmers and this is their house. You don’t just pick up a house and move it towards the river. It has things like power and farmland. It’s already shelter and they don’t have to do things like *make noise* to build a new house. 

7) they clearly illustrated that they put the baby in a soundproof box with oxygen and I thought that was the brilliant turn of the movie. The baby wasn’t outside that box a whole lot. 

8) I’m a deep sleeper I slept thru things louder than that when tired. She just had a baby that’s draining. What you should say though is how is she able to be so active after just giving birth and losing blood from a nail thru the foot?  It’s possible but unlikely. 

9) that was dramatic license but notice how the one alien followed them to the house and more were on the way. It did make a sound, the direct chose dramatically not to play it. The scene was focusing on the daughter having an emotional moment as her dad sacrificed himself for her and she’s deaf so you are experiencing her for that moment. 

Horror movies are a special class when it comes to disbelief. They play on fear, and not everyone knows how to “enjoy fear” at a movie.  Fear’s enemy is logic. Emotion is fear’s friend but it’s also the movie makers friend because movies are supposed to evoke an emotional response. All horror movies have a logic problem and play on illogical fears and no one can fault you for reaction, but also realize that hindsight is 20/20 so don’t go overboard with overthinking it and remember that sometimes people do make bad decisions it’s just that they have no time to explain bad decisions in a suspense movie. ",8a5qdo
dx5nts8,"This is a film about the human struggle for communication, and how it limits us. The main character goes to all these lengths to protect his loved ones but he can’t build a human connection with them, they are never really together in the familial sense. The monster represents the demons that this creates, its why it normally shows up during moments where the human need for connection arises and since these people haven’t dealt with the barriers that are tearing them apart, the monster normally conquers them, it is only in the end where they have broken these barriers that they are able to conquer their demons and move on(this is my interpretation and I could be dead wrong and it could be that the director had no intention of this message being present, so take it with a grain of salt) This movie still has some issues but overall it’s one of the best horror films in the last few years.",8a5qdo

dxfykfd,"I was actually quite disappointed with this film. The trailer showed some great scenes, a rich look into surviving a unique post apocalyptic scenario. But i feel the trailer showed the best of it. I expected a sci fi horror with depth, but it was a very shallow look at what was going on. There was very little info on the Primeval bat monsters and the whiteboards where a joke. I understand that its thr scenario we are thrown into and that a how-this-happened intro would not be in keeping with its style. But it's all about the breadcrumbs, the information not handed to you that you can collect yourself. 
Things I wanted from the film
-More interaction with the neighbours
-Less cheap jumpscares and no body horror (nail scene)
-A less forces ending",8a5qdo
dxn6y06,"I really enjoyed the film as a whole. I think it executed on what it wanted to do really well. Assuming that I am right about what the movie wanted to achieve, of course.

I saw this as a well crafted blockbuster with an interesting concept, good acting and horror elements baked into it. It's really a nailbiter throughout, with plenty of suspense set pieces that keep your attention. Moreover, it's aided by well-acted characters that you care about. I bought them as a family, I could empathize with their emotions and I did not want any of them to die, which elevated the scenes when the monsters are present or their threat is looming. The actors do a great job with the material they're given and you buy them as real people in those situations, however be warned that they don't always act in line with logic.

I didn't find the film to be particularly scary (might just be me) and there's no gore/disturbing imagery that you might expect from a horror movie. It's also not a jumpscare fest like a lot of modern horror movies, so people seeking to be constantly startled by the cool new exciting horror movie will probably be disappointed.

If you’re interested in watching the film, I would suggest taking it as an experience rather than try to read into it like it’s an intellectual film. It’s just meant to be entertainment for the masses, imo, with a surface level plot based around an interesting concept and packed with suspense set pieces. If you're looking to get entertained, you won't be disappointed. It's paced well, with a short runtime and a good sprinkling of set pieces that build to a big climax. The movie does not allow you time to get bored/overthink any particulars about the world when you're watching.

Definitely worth the price of admission if you're seeking a fun time. 7 to a light 8/10


Now, if you want to analyze the film and its world. If you're looking to disect the plot and think about it after the theatre, cracks do appear. Heck, some appear blatantly in the plot. However, I felt that the heart of the movie is the family and the shitty situation they are in, so I just disregarded the following during the runtime and bitched about them after the movie with the friends I was with. 

Here are the annoying bits:

If you're still on the fence and plot logic is essential to you for your enjoyment of a movie, read at least the first two in the list and make a decision.

2 things right off the bat:

[No one who actually cares about their child and is responsible, which the parents here are clearly portrayed as being, would ever leave the youngest child (seemingly still an infant) in the family walk in the back, unguided, in a fucking killer alien infested world is just bull. It's there simply to aid the plot and if you're taken out of the movie here and proceed to scoff at the rest of the film, save yourself the trouble.](#spoiler)

[For reference: My little sister is about twice the age of the little kid and I don't even let her hand go if we're ever in the street together. ](#spoiler)

Some may not consider this a spoiler, but I didn't know about this going into the movie and it solidified the threat of the monsters for me knowing that the movie would do this.

Second, the baby. The baby is purely a plot device and no one in that situation would ever willingly conceive a child.

These two things are all in the very beginning of the film (first 10 minutes) and are there solely to aid the plot later on.

Plot devices later on in the film include:

[Miraculous pin pointing upwards in a wooden stair setup earlier + water breaks at the perfect moment for a set piece with the creatures. Also, very pregnant woman carries a sack of potatoes up the stairs for no reason.](#spoiler)


[Old survivor puts fellow survivors in danger for NO REASON. Dude clearly wanted to kill himself but he had no reason to shout when he did. He could have just let them pass before. The reaction also wasn't a sudden reaction to the death of his wife. The shot establishes him just standing there over his dead wife for a solid minute ish, dead silent, before he screams.](#spoiler)


[Kid falls into grain store thing by plot magic & ""inconsistent grain physics"". (The latter did not bother me, but I found this whole sequence to be awful and contrived)](#spoiler) 


[Another thing that annoyed me personally was the whole plot arc leading to Lee dying. This is PURELY my opinion and expectation from the story, but I just did not like this arc. It's not that it was terribly done, I just feel as though a more satisfactory ending could have been formulated with them all being alive.](#spoiler)


[After the contrived grain sequence and subsequent escape, I don't understand why they didn't try to hide or make their way back to the safe house (soundproof basement) by food. They did not know it was flooded and it's been established that they can move and not alert the creature (see: basement water scene & Lee running in the sand in the beginning not getting him attacked). They chose this direction to have that sacrificial proclaimation of love, i get it. They even have some setup to it, yes. It doesn't make me feel any better about this arc though.](#spoiler)


[It also just eats at the back of my head that there is a possibility that they wanted emily blunt to be badass female lead (despite having no real setup towards this) at the end and killing Lee off was means of solidifying this. Not saying the ending is bad, I'm sure she knows how to use a shotgun in this kind of world. I'm just being a bitch because I didn't get the ending I was hoping for.](#spoiler)",8a5qdo

dxx17ed,"I watched the movie today.Normaly those kind of more subtle horror or mystery thrillers are  exactly my alley, but i just couldnt get over all of those plot holes.The acting and overall atmosphere is actually really good but:

\- How can the creatures move as fast through a highly dense environment, like a forest, when they are blind? If they have a a kind of ultrasonic sensing ability, like a bat, then they are not really blind and could see/sense the humans by reflecting sound of of them. I also didnt see any  antennas or sensing tentacles to feel their environment with their body extensions. On earth there are also blind animals, like  moles, or some deep see fish, but none of those is living in an environment where it has to navigate obstacles with a movement speed of 360 km/h.

\- Everytime they make sound it only takes under 10 seconds for one of the creatures to reach the noise source and the father wrote on his board that only 3 creatures are in this area. We dont know what he means with ""this area"", but if we would only talk about 1 square kilometer, which is the nearest creature away, then it had to run with a speed of 100m/s = 360 km/h to reach the noise sourche in around 10 seconds, through the forest with all of that dense vegetation standing in its way, while it is blind at the same time, how should this work?

\- Why are they not living exactly beside the river or waterfall to camouflage their own noise.

\-Why do the creatures not hear the sound the father is sending with his radio while checking all the frequencies after survivers?

\- Why cant the creatures hear the humans breath and their heartbeat when they are standing directly next to them when they can hear otherwise a breaking glas lamp from a mile away?Thats not how sound intensity works.

\- Why are all the objects they need for a living standing high up on some shelfs at their own home, where they can drop down and make noise, instead of standing directly on the ground.

\- What powers all the electical lights. A generator would make to much noice.

\- And if they have electricity then why do they not have wired up a megaphone a few hundret meters away from their house, ready to make sound by the click of a button and lure the creatures away from their house.

\- How did they manage to fill the whole road up with sand for several kilometer\(sand is very heavy\).

\- Why can the creatures rip through the metall of the supply silo but cant rip through the metall of the car ceiling, to get through to the kids hiding inside the car ?

\- If those are really aliens, why are they so stupid. If they didnt build the ships they used to travel to earth themself, but rather are only biological killing machines, set free by their creators to kill all intelegent life on this planet, then why did their creators design them blind?",8a5qdo
dx23mzp,"Entertaining enough.  Good tension and the monsters looked great.  

Though when Jim sacrificed himself telling his girl he loved her my eyes almost rolled out of my head.  ",8a5qdo
dx0ifnr,"This movie was OK, but it is nowhere near the 8.3/10 (IMDB) masterpiece that people make it out to be. That's better than Rashomon, Up, Judgement at Nuremberg, Million Dollar Baby etc., to name a few. I'd give it no more than a 6.5 - 7.

The **GOOD**:

Good screenplay, good action, and props to the director (Jim) for engaging the audience with near silence.

The **BAD**:

1. So, people never fart/cough/sneeze/**snore** in this world?

2. Really, never snore/cough/sneeze in your sleep?

3. Monsters can hear a spoon fall from hundreds of feet, but will not hear breathing from six feet away?

4. The daughter gets saved twice with the high frequency noise from the earpiece, but simple completely ignores it when Jim has to die for the sake of dramatization?

5. Why yell and get the monster to him, he could have flung the shovel at the metal shack and let the kids escape. If that didn't work, he'd have a second chance to sacrifice himself and extend the time he gives his kids to go home.

5. If they can live in a ""sound proofed"" room, why not just simply put the mattress there and live there all the time? Seems safer. Why hold off till the baby was born?

6. How fucking stupid is it to have a baby in that world? Ok, he got child birth covered, but they will keep the baby from crying for two years? No one has ever sat in a plane/bus/room/anyfuckingwhere with a baby? Babies fucking suck at keeping quiet.

7. All the world governments figured out they only hear sound, and no one thought to use a different frequency to handle the monsters? Are you fucking kidding me?

8. Typical Hollywood solution of shooting aliens/monsters/demons/evil spirits/anyfuckingthing..

9. Everyone is dead, but they have electricity?

It was a pretty stupid movie overall.",8a5qdo
dww2rgb,The opening was completely unexpected and shut my theater up for the rest of the movie. Also why did they think it was a good idea to have another baby? However I loved the ending. Wish we knew a bit more where these things came from but overall I give it an 8.5/10. ,8a5qdo
dww2vqs,"*Loved it*

The use of sound (or lack thereof) half the time was extraordinary and after the intro scene when the youngest son died, I just never knew exactly what would happen.  The absolute best part of the movie though, was that the woman next to me drinking her wine was so damn expressive the entire time, it was hilarious and added so much.  I would just glance over and see her knees against her chest, hands covering most of her face.  Perfection.

But more about the actual movie, the only thing I really questioned was their having another baby.  They were so hardy and logical about virtually every other decision but this one just astounded me.  And contrary to many others that I'm sure will complain about it, I kinda liked the ending.  They spent the entire time so alone, so afraid of everything outside their little farm.  And with ~~Jim~~ Lee dying, it was just a whole lot of ""Fuck it, let's kill these bastards"".

dwxc959,"Awesome movie!

And of course it's just that - a movie, but I still have a million questions.

Why are the aliens killing everyone? Are they eating them?

Why didn't the family just live near the waterfall?

How did they expect to keep their infant son quiet for a sustained period of time? They would have to find a way to keep that child silent for a good 4-5 years, then maybe at that point he would understand that he has to be silent all the time.

Is the whole world affected by this incident? We see that a meteorite landed in Mexico from the news clipping, but how would they get to other continents? We see one of them in water, so I guess they can swim....but thousands of miles blindly? Is there any evidence that it was a coordinated invasion of some kind or was it their landing on Earth totally random?

How do they have power? I'm assuming there's a generator, but don't generators make a whole bunch of noise?

How did the creatures manage to take down civilization in such a short period of time? Did they just plow through billions of people? How did they manage to overtake armies? I get that they have super tough skin, but are they able to take down a dude in a tank?

How many creatures are there? There are 3 in the region, but is there any evidence that they're all over the world?

How did no one in the world ever think to lure them with a shit ton of sound and then nuke them or bury them or burn them? I get that they have super tough skin, but dousing them in gasoline and setting them on fire wouldn't do the trick? Or dumping acid all over them? Or crushing them with a giant rock?

I loved this movie and these questions actually don't affect how I feel about it as a whole. Honestly just curious if there are any little easter eggs in there that I'm missing and if there are ways of explaining some of these things based on the info they give us.

dwxiv2v,"John Krasinski put a lot of love into this film, and it shows. Everything from the cast's performance, to the sets, music, creature design, and of course his direction. Everything just comes together in a beautiful and horrifying cocktail. The story by itself isn't all that original. John Krasinski's character dying and the overall arch and message of the film is something we've seen before and didn't hold a lot of surprises. But it just works so well and feels fresh in this particular film because we actually care about the characters and we feel like we're there with them. Trying to hold our breath and not crumble our bag of chips too loudly. It's quite simply just executed with near perfection.

It's a beautiful story in its own right, and I wouldn't want to change it. The fact that it's not bleak, hopeless, and grey for a post-apocalyptic horror/drama/thriller film is actually quite surprising. I was almost expecting that she would have to smother the baby or shit like that. That the story wouldn't end with the parents *redeeming* themselves and protecting their children.

dwyc4o1,"I thought it was ok. 

My biggest thing is that a movie has to subscribe to the reality it sets for itself, even if it’s as outlandish as alien monsters. I get that John had to have the climax with him signing the little girl that he loved her and then yelling but the whole sequence made no sense. 

We saw this creature is able to rip a massive hole through a steel grain silo in less than a second even while weakened from the hearing aid just a few minutes prior. Why it didn’t rip the truck’s roof off in half a second, who knows. Why it didn’t just slam a spiked arm through the already broken out windows to impale the kids in one swoop, who knows. We were shown many times how strong and fast and powerful this creature is, and now it just makes an old rusty truck’s sheet-metal roof a bongo drum and chills out for a whole minute letting the plot unravel? Well ok but you lost me there.

It also didn’t make sense for John to just let this thing have at it for the 15 or so seconds to sign the message to his daughter. Like “well good luck for the next 15 seconds kiddos, I’ve got something to tell you.” 

I’m sure many people loved that part but it completely unsubscribes from the reality the movie set for itself. 

Also how in the world did they not find a pacifier for that baby? Half the tense scenes could’ve been avoided with that simple step, and maybe that’s why that was avoided. How that’s less convenient than an oxygen tank and mask and covered crib box I’ll never know. 

Also the bloody hand on shower-glass jump scare was stupid as hell.

Final note: It felt like they didn’t know how to end the movie. Like they got to that point and were like “crap, now what.” A massive action sequence had just happened and they didn’t know how to follow it up so they just said “screw it let’s do a movie cliche shotgun pump and cut to black.” That’s how it felt to me anyways.

For whatever reason, they got pregnant and wanted to make it work. For whatever reason, the dad felt he had to sacrifice himself, to prove to his daughter he loved her...it worked as an emotional moment in the movie. As a father, I got some dust in my eye.

The film does employ horror movie cliches but it executes them with skill, using its brilliant premise to its full advantage. There’s maybe one too many false jump scares though.

The screenplay lacks any fat, all whilst giving enough characterisation to really care about this family. The lack of unnecessary exposition is refreshing.

The film is incredibly fast paced at 95 minutes, never dragging a bit.

The performances here are fantastic from all, especially for a horror film. Blunt and especially Krasinski are brilliant, as are the child actors in the film.

This will be an audience hit which combines crowd pleasing horror beats and enough artful direction for both horror fans and film lovers to appreciate.

A lot of the jump scares were false, but I'm willing to overlook that bc the story, character development and conclusion of the film were so spot on. The sense of dread was apparent throughout the entire film and the actors just killed their performances as well. You can tell John was a broken, scared father who will do anything to protect and better his family. You can tell the deaf girl has been living with guilt for over a year.

dxegnbq,"The audience realizes the power of frequencies the first time it happens in the cornfield. Krasinski clearly tells us again in the silo and again in the truck. Yet we must painfully watch as the daughter doesn't realize until the very end.

One of the things I really disliked was the score. It wasn't terrible, but nothing spectacular either. Now I'm no musician, but this just didn't seem very original to me, and I found myself bored at times. If a movie has very minimal dialogue, I feel like good music is essential since it can tell an audience how to feel during a particular scene. There has been many times I've felt more emotionally invested in a scene because of a song rather than what the characters were actually saying to each other. To be honest I wouldn't even mind the music, it was just the when it was used that I was really disappointed with. The entire first scene you are introduced to characters who have to live in a world free of sound, wouldn't it be cool if we got to experience that same silence with them? The music just felt distracting, I feel like I wouldn't have minded as much if what was paying was something softer. Plus, the sound of the [rocket](#spoiler) would've been more impactful and tense, since it would've broken the silence the audience had already gotten used to. 

The movie also set up so many things I always found myself questioning. For example, is this family supposed to be smart or stupid? They do all this planning to stay quiet yet are so careless with their young kids and objects around them? I absolutely hated the scene where [the mom got her bag stuck on the nail. First of all, only a child would decide pulling on something would be a good idea to get it unstuck, why not see why it's stuck? It was stuck a second ago, don't just yank it so carelessly. And lets say she does decide to yank the bag to get it free, which she does, how did that even force the nail upwards? I feel like that bag would've ripped before that would've happened.](#spoiler) I feel like I've already written too much, so I'll just end on one other thing I wanted to bring up that I felt wasn't as obvious as the other problems. [How were those fully grown raccoons alive? Haven't those creatures been there for more than a year now? Animals are dumb and make noise, they would've all been dead. I thought maybe the creature only hunted humans, but then it like, smashes one for no reason? I just don't get it.](#spoiler)

Spoilers ahead. I can't get past the fact that they had another child.. even after seeing what happened to the last one. If she had been pregnant before the monsters arrived then I could understand it. If they didn't have any children, then I could understand it because it could be justified. Maybe even if there was ANY kind of dialogue about regret, questiong their decision, it was an accident, we should have this baby to keep humanity alive. Nope, nothing but lets have a child that makes noise 24/7 and keep it in a box.

e1cbqmd,"This movie was incredibly mediocre. Literally everything these people do makes noise yet the movie treats it like dead silence if they are moving slow or being careful. I honestly have no clue how this movie got such high ratings. You could call the ending from a mile away and then the day after the father dies the mother and daughter figure out their weakness, by accident no less! 

Few things that bugged me.

-Parents take a toy away from their child because it makes noise but conviently leave the batteries and toy in arms reach, then never pay attention to him and even travel ahead until he is about to die.  

-Conveniently even though the kid knows he isn't supposed to be making noise. He somehow has fun flying around a noisy spaceship. like he doesn't know what will happen. 

-The father studies hearing aides yet thinks he can cobble something together to make sound from a brain implant. These things aren't backwards compatible and are highly specialized. 

-Everything makes noise, from the fire on a candle to the foot steps of a person. This movie treats these things like they're silent just because music isn't being played and the characters are acting very carefully.  These creatures can hear a picture frame drop on the floor from a mile away but can't hear a heartbeat when right next to a human?

-Father screams and is alright just because he is by a waterfall that clearly isn't as loud as his scream. 

-Walking up and down a completely wooden and very old staircase that never once creaks or makes sound.

-Old man loses his wife in the forest to a creature and is so distraught he just has to scream so they can possibly kill another himself, another man, and his child.

-Literally the only failsafe this family has is fireworks when a remote speaker making loud noises away from the home would have been a better plan. For that matter ANYTHING would have been a better plan. 

-Woman goes to the bathroom to hide as she is giving birth instead of in their sound proof safe room. 

-Kid runs through corn stalks instead of between them so he can make as much noise as possible.

-Kids camp out on top of an old creaky corn silo instead of walking back to their house. The daughter didn't care about spending the night on a bridge out in the open, what is their deal now?

-The basement has enough time to fill half way with water before the wife wakes up. 

-Creature doesn't hear kids moving around in corn when they are directly beneath it. 

-kid conveniently shuts off hearing aide so the creature isn't affected and can kill her father. 

-Kid uses hearing aide against microphone when these types of devices decode sounds and send electrical signals to the brain, they don't actually create sound.

How this is sitting at a 7.9 on imdb with globally good reviews is beyond me. The entire story can be summed up in two sentences, the characters are dumber than a box of rocks, the plot armor is so thick, their soundless lives make no sense, nothing is explained, the science is flat out wrong, and for Christ sake could you have a more predictable ending?

dx07l33,"I really wanted to love this movie, but it just killed me that they have power and all sorts of electronics, but nobody thought to just rig up some speakers/mechanical noisemakers outside in case the aliens got inside the perimeter of the farm.

Maybe Wemblee Arena was closed for renos, and they were really short on lighter fluid and matches. ",8a5qdo
dxdu6x1,"Half way through this movie I was struck by how much it pissed me off, the same way The Blair Witch Project did. As soon as you realize how retarded the ""gimmick"" that drives the plot is, the whole concept falls apart - i.e., a blind creature that hunts by sound wiping out civilization. For fuck's sake, our military has an arsenal of sonic weapons developed for ""crowd control"" and offensive uses that would have made wiping these things out a matter of fact. And why not use sounds to lure the creatures into killing fields or pits? Yes, they included a shot of a newspaper headline that weakly addressed this glaring plot hole by proclaiming the creatures were resistant to bullets and bombs, but *really?* How can any bone armor ever withstand high-powered high-velocity shells that can penetrate several feet of plate armor or a bunker-buster bomb that can penetrate several dozen feet of steel-reinforced concrete? C'mon, you can't simply dismiss a plot hole like that with a throw-away shot of a newspaper headline. Just for the sake of argument, that shells and bombs *were* somehow ineffective against them, then why not use biological warfare? They eat, they breathe, they can be poisoned. In the meantime, set up speakers on towers or trees that play a cacophony of sound that keep these creatures forever off-balanced.   


BTW, where were they getting their electricity from? And how were they keeping their field so well tilled without the use of farm equipment?",8a5qdo
dww7mz2,Just finished seeing it. I really liked it if not for the fact that it was different. I couldn’t wait to see how the family would survive day to day life without making any noise. You definitely have to put a bit of logic and common sense by the wayside to really enjoy it though. The friend I saw it with didn’t like it because he kept questioning everything. “Why did they have a baby during the apocalypse?” “Why didn’t the military just draw them to one place with noise and then trap them/kill them?” “Why didn’t they just live near the water to drown out their noises?” Because.

Then you're fucked. Another thing was the 'drowning' in grain scene.  Eek.  You can walk on grain, you don't sink.  My uncle actually died in a grain bin accident. How people die is that they get in them when the auger is still running and it will suck you down.  Really really fast.  2 people from my home town have died that way.  But yes, you can dig them out if the auger is not running. Another, after day 473, all of the grain/corn was planted in straight rows, via tractors and planters.

They should have called it Watch Idiots Make the Dumbest Fucking Decisions Ever: The Movie",8a5qdo
dwwmzgn,"There's such a massive circlejerk surrounding this film and I'm not getting it at all. I genuinely thought this was a massive letdown. Whenever the slightest bit of tension built up, it was diminished immediately by annoying, loud, stock-sounding music cues. On top of that, the film was arguably as bland as the music. The framing in some shots is just terrible and they do nothing interesting with the camera. The colour pallette basically doesn't exist either, they tried to go for ""gritty sepia tone"" and gave us ""shitty Western"".

The characters do so much stupid shit that it makes the film boring and annoying to watch. Even right at the opening, there's a scene involving a large rocket toy, where, instead of the kid who had just been told the toy was too fucking loud just throwing it away, he holds it over his fucking head. There's other dumb shit like the girl who's deaf and therefore cannot percieve sound running away to go fish, and John Krasinski knocking up his wife a second time, even though getting the resources for that would be difficult as fuck given where they are, plus,  pregnancies are fucking loud as anything.

The characters have hardly any personality, so it's genuinely difficult to care about what happens to them. I couldn't tell you one thing about Emily Blunt's character besides that she's pregnant. I'm genuinely surprised that she could emote so well given she has such underwritten material to work with. The material really is just that bad. If Emily Blunt wasn't pregnant, you wouldn't have a movie. There's not enough conflict, the plot doesn't exist and the only thing that actually happens only does because of her pregnancy.

I could go on for days about how much of a shit show this actually was, however, that'd be boring as shit to do. Essentially, it's a badly-made horror with no style, where nothing happens, made by someone with little understanding of the genre.",8a5qdo

How did the daughter not figure out after two encounters with the monster that her hearing aid was the Slim Whitman of the movie?

Why didn't the old guy in the woods tell them to leave before yelling and letting the monster get him?

Why did the youngest son in the opening deliberately make a loud noise after living three months in a world where making noise kills people? Did they just not make the risk clear enough before? We won't know.

Why would you slam your hand against a shower door when there are monsters still on your property that can hear small sounds from miles away? In fact, why was everyone going out of their way to be as surprising as possible in trying to get attention from someone else?

After living in a silent world for over a year, how did he not hear the water overflowing right next to him?

The scene with the birth and the fireworks was brilliant - but I feel like that should have been the climax. I went in expecting a movie specifically built to create a lot of tension through the silence, with a few very earned jump-scares - instead it had a great opening, and then the sound track and sound effects telling you when to be scared with a ton of incredibly cheap jump scares. And I assume some jackass in post production decided it would be a wonderful idea to accompany each jump scare with a huge BANG. It felt cheaper than it should have 

Maybe it's because it's a great concept that got muddied. Or maybe it's because- during the entire showing I went to - two geriatric fellows decided to loudly about everything happening. The whole time.

dwz4f34,"Hey guys, I'm just curious if anyone else felt similarly to me. I was kinda disappointed overall after like, halfway through the movie or so? I just kinda felt like not a lot of stuff made sense, firstly I guess Why would they EVER decide to get pregnant and make a literal fleshy noise machine when they're in this kind of situation? Secondly, How have they made it 400+ days into this and they're best preparations/failsafes are turning some lights red and having a single rocket set up somewhere? The guy is clearly smart, he was making or at least adjusting hearing aids for his daughter, and they know these monsters just kinda fling themselves at any sounds they hear, so I dont know why they wouldn't set up SOMETHING to make noise a bit farther away, like anything that can be triggered at a distance. Finally, the monsters who have very sensitive/strong hearing...their overall weakness that lets them kill them... is just high frequency/loud sounds...and being shot. Again I dont get how they'd make it 400 days into this and not have at least some clue about that. 

I know this reads like a rant but it's not like I super disliked the movie or anything, the acting and the sounds in the movie where all good stuff, it's just that everyone seems to be talking about how perfect it is.",8a5qdo

dwwdop8,"For a movie with such unique prospects of sound design choices the soundtrack really stood out to me as painfully generic.

 The pitter-pattering of feet on different materials, the extra-emphasized rushing of water, the rustling of the fields of plants or surrounding trees/underbrush. All of their sounds were never overstated but subtly backlit scenes with no musical scoring. 

Enter the soundtrack. Same old same old gigantic swell when there's a jump scare, [same exact theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RfI6F55eKI) (correct me if this isn't the right song please) whenever the main monster is on screen or nearby, uninspired percussive *whatever* when characters are running wherever (the younger boy running to the rockets, or later in the field being a good example of this). 

It's recursive in mostly negative ways from my perspective, seeing as it felt like a collective vomit bucket of your standard discordant horror string instrument flair coupled with some lazy Inception/Hans Zimmer style uptempo bits to fill in for the action scenes. Overall it still fits the bill for a horror movie since most peoples' expectations for soundtracks in horror aren't really very high and the standard still does its job of keeping the viewers' heart rates up when deemed ""necessary"" by the filmmakers.

dx5mzb0,"I saw this with my wife and younger sister this weekend, so my arm was being squeezed pretty hard at some points.  But that's the mark of a great scary movie to me!  Definitely more suspense than horror - and many of the scares were well telegraphed beforehand.

Blunt and Krasinski have good on-screen chemistry and I really liked Millicent Simmons in her role as their daughter.  She really pulled off the ""moody teenager"" thing well.  There was surprisingly good characterization for a film in which there is almost no dialogue.  I was in a bigger, fuller theater but fortunately one in which almost everyone was respectful of the film and the atmosphere it was trying to create.  At one point during a very tense moment someone dropped something on the ground, there was dead silence and then a quiet ""sorry"", everyone burst out laughing.  For me a good audience can enhance a film experience just as much as a bad one can ruin it, so I hope most people can find a nice quiet one.

I'm not a stickler for ""reality"" applying in films - I like some pretty dumb stuff - but there were a number of things that bugged me about the movie.  For non-spoilers, I do wish we had gotten a bit more world-building either initially or later.  We got glimpses but nothing that told us anything useful.  As far as inconsistencies go, [the movie made it clear that quiet sounds could be masked by louder ones, but unless the 'monsters' literally had their ear-head-things to the wall, normal-volume conversation inside a house isn't going to carry or be audible over ambient noise outside.  But the characters never spoke to each other even indoors, and seemed surprised that their literal padded underground room allowed them to talk without being detected.  In that same vein, the picture that Blunt drops that shatters and brings the creatures into the house wouldn't be audible over background noise more than a very short distance away.  That bugged me.  The supposed invulnerability of the creatures to *every* conventional weapon, yet being weakened enough to be killed by a single shotgun blast, also makes very little sense - were they vulnerable because they were disoriented?  There is ""armor"" covering the most sensitive part of the sound-sensing organs in the creature's head, but they also open up that armor when scanning - so had nobody ever attempted to shoot them while they were doing that?  I could add a few more things to the list: my father grew up on a farm and had a few kids he knew die in grain elevator accidents.  You don't get sucked down into the grain like quicksand unless the elevator is actively unloading.  To be using the door panel as a life raft one minute and then to be literally *hiding under it* the next was a facepalm moment for me.  And, for the love of God, why wasn't some sort of diversion (preferably multiple) that could be triggered *remotely* not literally the first thing that they built?  That dad installed a full CCTV system and 10000 white and red light bulbs and didn't think to himself that it might be useful to have some sort of noise-making device on a remote switch?  ""Hey run through the field at night and light these rockets which will then bring every monster from miles around to exactly where you are.""](#spoiler)

So that may actually be a pretty long list but I probably have a shorter tolerance for inconsistencies in suspense films than other genres.  I want a situation to be suspenseful because it's well-crafted, not because characters make dumb decisions or the bad guy has reality-bending amounts of plot armor and weaponry.  

Overall though it was a well-acted and suspenseful movie, and I actually appreciated the shorter length, it's a rarity to spend less than 2 hours in the theater these days.",8a5qdo

dx6irfy,"Just want to touch on something I haven't seen noted already. This movie was great for what it didn't explain, and so it was kept short and fast. Like how the family knew sign language for the daughter, years before the arrival of the monsters. This helped them be one of the few groups to survive for as long as they have. Also, they don't say it, but the trip into town that we saw at the beginning was likely their last, at least together. That means that the family has become mostly reclusive over the following year, aiding to the fear of going outside even more. And probably making a everyone a little more on edge and erratic.",8a5qdo
dx6w1gt,"I'm not one for scary movies, but I saw this anyway and I absolutely loved it. My only complaint is that there were a few too many jump scares that were entirely unnecessary, like:

* The older daughter stands at the top of the stairs leading to the basement. Just as she's about to go down, *jump scare!* Her father appears behind her and holds her back and tells her not to go downstairs

* There's noises outside the house. Is it the monsters? *Jump scare!* It's a raccoon, falling from the roof and screaming for some reason

Moments like these were unnecessary, and detracted from the movie. But overall it was still an excellent movie",8a5qdo

Last I would have had the wife stay in the soundproofed room during the entire last week before she was due. Not a movie tweak because it wouldn't make for a better movie, but a practical suggestion for someone in that situation.

There is absolutely no way I could believe that Emily Blunt just made a baby pop out of her with the creature right there not hearing shit. Absolutely no way. 

Why the fuck would you have a kid? The kid is a automatic death sentence for it and the family (unless you follow the thought of living underground or near the waterfall). 

Why do they always motion everyone to be quiet when that is their whole existence? Like no shit be quiet...always be quiet

But the main gripe of this movie that I have is that I can not believe that humans couldn't figure out a way that radio frequency fucks up these creatures so badly. Like some teenage deaf girl is the only one that stumbles into the solution? No way. There are 6 billion people in this world and no one can figure out how to beat creatures that can only hunt with sound? Not even echo location or sonar...but straight sound. Also let's say that they couldn't figure out the frequency thing. If 1 shotgun shot kills 1 of these things than the army would absolutely destroy these creatures. If not, everyone be fucking quiet for a while and set a trap that bombs these fuckers to hell...I just couldn't believe that these creatures (the way they are presented) could wipe out the human race like that.

dx1jnn2,"Just watched it a few hours ago. I found the jump-scares to be a bit overdone, but it was a good movie overall. I loved the concept and how they just focused on the family.

At first, I wondered how these creatures without technology could take over seemingly the entire planet and overwhelm the military as I served in the army (08-13) and figure that there is certainly weaponry which should have been able to take on these creatures. However, I later reflected on how a tremendous number of these creatures scattered about the world would do exactly that...particularly due to their strengths of speed and armor. Basically a biological blitzkrieg. Millions or potentially even hundreds of thousands of these could reasonably take out most life on the planet in a quick span of time if scattered around the world.

If the armor were truly strong enough to counter most ammunition utilized by military forces around the world which is designed for taking out people with soft flesh, it would severely restrict the capacity to take them out. However, I refuse to believe that even a .50 caliber rifle or machine gun wouldn't be effective because it is able to go through at least 1'' of steel with no problem with some of that weaponry able to go through closer to 2'' of steel. The issue REALLY faced with the armor is there wouldn't be ENOUGH effective weaponry to take on the massive assault likely faced on a worldwide scale. Airpower also means little if you can't control the fight on the ground.

A lot of the nitpicking around the premise can be let go. You know what you were getting into when you bought the ticket. You can't look too deeply into it or it falls apart and that's fine.

- If these things are so attracted to noise then why not have a PA system wired up way away from the property that you can use in emergencies to lure them all away from the house. Sure they might destroy it but it would give you time to be quiet then rewire it the next day, instead of sending your kid off to light fireworks.

- How have you lived for an entire year and only have 3 things written on a white board. It was literally for the audience, and with WEAKNESS and ITS SOUND right next to each other it was a ham-fisted delivery to the end of the movie.

- Why would you have a fucking kid in this climate. Ya one died but you risk your entire family by having a baby. If there are pills for the kid then you better believe there is a whole stock pile of morning after pills and birth control. Why risk it for a bone sesh.

- There is absolutely no way the military wouldnt have figured out its sound if they hunt using sound. There are sound proof bunkers out there where they would have figure this out and if the creature cant rip through a truck then it has no chance at getting into a bunker. Also if it can die from a shot gun blast you dont think that the military would have eradicated these things pretty much immediately by luring them with sound and vaporizing them with a mini gun, or better yet just make a tonne of noise and then set off a massive bomb.

- Cheap jump scares. The raccoon scene was laughable.

- After a year of having to be dead quiet and your baby brother getting merked by one of these things, youd think the kids would get that you cant make noise without having to shush them.

dx0nhh2,"I wanted to like this film, but too many real world plot holes I just couldn't shake. I get that movies are set in a fantasy world, and there must be a suspension of belief. But if you are going to use real world elements to drive your story, then those elements must be able to withhold real world scrutiny. The same way that signs was a failure and it follows was fantastic. 

In signs, the creatures were vulnerable to water... but there is water ""everywhere"". On the ground, falling from the sky, and even in the air. Fail.
 
In ""It follows"", the creature was supernatural, while the rest of the cast had to deal with the constraints of reality. You never knew what the creature would do next, but the cast had to run and swim and lock doors.

In This movie, I feel that some very simple additions would solve the real world plot holes.

spoilers follow:

PROBLEM: [The creatures are attracted to sound. But you live in a big creaky old farmhouse out in the open?? You drop a spoon, and DEAD. A few times you can see the cast looking out glass windows and through open doors???](#spoiler)

SOLUTION: [Living in sound proof or underground places would not be as susceptible. Their living spaces should be densely packed with sound suppressants. Mattresses, cloth, Storm shelters, or even boats and ocean vessels.](#spoiler)

PROBLEM: [You know that loud noise drowns out small noise in the waterfall scene, but you don't set up camp there???](#spoiler)

SOLUTION: [A line of dialogue. ""We can't stay too long, I've seen them come here at night to drink"".](#spoiler)

PROBLEM: [electricity takes generators (LOUD), or city power. If the city has people working at the power plant... then why aren't you going there??? ](#spoiler)

SOLUTION: [Pan the camera past some solar panels in a farm shot.](#spoiler)

Blunt's performance was brilliant, as was Krasinski's, they were so good within what was essentially a silent movie, that I barely noticed the monster, which is an achievement when you consider most movies never show you the monster until you get a small glimpse at the end as it's destroyed, while this one had the monster on full display early on.

Noah Jupe put in a fairly good performance as well, his portrayal of a terrified kid was really quite good.

This movie was so inconsistent with what could or couldn't be heard. The monster can hear the timer clicking from upstairs but can't hear someone breathing or a baby crying from a few feet away? The monster could rip through a silo but can't open up the roof of a truck. And even if you're running on sand you're making sound and for sure you're breathing and gasping for air after you're done running. It was a good premise but they really didn't pay attention to any of the actual details to support the premise. 

edit: Also they use the truck to get away which FOR SURE should be loud enough to hear by the monsters standards, so even if one monster was preoccupied why aren't the other two coming into the area to chase after the truck?

dxfbour,"I really enjoyed it, but thinking back on it makes it worse. There's enough plot holes in this movie to drive a bus through and yet that doesn't really take much away from the movie when you're watching it. It wasn't all that scary, but it created a really nice atmosphere of fear so you have to give credit for that. It felt authentic as a viewer the acting was far better than I anticipated. I felt fully immersed in the movie and never found myself distracted by the acting or the pace.  Emily Blunt really did a great job, that bathtub scene was pretty breathtaking. I was on the edge of my seat through that entire sequence.

Thinking back at the man in the woods, I had an interesting shift of perspective from when I saw it last night.  When I was watching it, I thought that he was trying to hurt the father and the son. But that was clearly wrong when thinking back on it. He was helping them escape, not trying to hurt them by calling the aliens over. I'm interested why I originally thought he was trying to hurt them, and also if my perspective shift is incorrect. I'm not really sure if I feel this way only because of what happens with the father after he's been mortally wounded.

Either way, I really enjoyed it, but I wish they had built more of the backstory of the aliens with flashbacks or something like that. I appreciate the atmosphere of the film, but I think backstory would have made it a more complete story. Though possibly it was because it may have disrupted the suspense and cohesion.

A couple dumb nitpick I have though is if the creatures are hyper sensitive to sound wouldn't the first thing you do is direct a high frequency sound at them.

Monster in the corn? Fuck the quiet path that people seem to run full speed on without making a sound, I’m gonna run through the noisy-ass corn!

We’re on the highest and possibly safest ground to be on, and also in the most obvious place to look for us once it’s light out? Nah. Can’t stay here because Dad won’t come here because I think he hates me. Even though I’m convinced he’ll come looking for the kid he likes. Fuck self preservation.

dx3c5uj,"This was a gorgeously made movie and probably THE film that will draw more peoples' attention to sound design in movies.

That said, I was disappointed by how poorly the concept was handled.

A lot of the things that bothered me have to do with how the family lived. It's been over a year but their house isn't soundproofed. On the contrary- they leave doors open all day to bang with a breeze, have large, open windows to echo sound, and live in the middle of a *cornfield*, ensuring they can't see anything coming on any side of them.  Like...how do they even harvest it? How do they get the grain into the silo? Why even plant more if you have a silo full of the stuff?

Where is the electricity coming from? They sure have a lot of it. Generators are noisy and need gas. You'd need a shitload of solar panels for all the lights, tv screens, cameras, etc.

If you have all that electricity and cords strung all over the property, why do you not have speakers on every edge so you can broadcast noise *away* from your house? Couldn't they have 20 speakers ready for distraction purposes?

So. Many. Questions.

But my biggest issue is this- the cochlear implant. Users don't wear them all the time and they certainly wouldn't wear it if it didn't work. They're heavy. They hurt. You can't really sleep in them and there'd be absolutely no point to wearing it if *it didn't work*.

I have no idea why she turned off the hearing aid when it saved her twice. Sure, she might not have known. But then why did she turn it on at the end? Because she saw the word ""weakness"" etched onto the whiteboard? Every aspect of the film is fantastic except for her. 

If I were to make a small change to would fix most problems I had with her, it would be for her to reject the hearing aid when the father tried to give it to her. Have the hearing aid she was carrying around still work against the monsters, but have it come off in the grain mill when she's drowning in oats. So when the monster is attacking them in the car, the hearing aid isn't there to save her. Then when she's in the basement, she finds the new hearing aid her father tried to make for her. She puts it on, but it doesn't work like in the original scene where she got it. So now when the monsters return, the hearing aid hurts them and she finally puts two and two together.

dx96dxk,"So... I didn't like the movie. Apparently I am in the .0001%. I can go into a bunch of reasons why I didn't like it but the biggest issue I had with it was that the focus of the story was too broad - more specifically in that the movie didn't seem like it knew which relationship to use to drive the narrative. Apparently the big climax of the movie is when the dad confesses his love for his daughter before his death and yet their relationship beforehand is not explored at all. We see the daughter sort of have this weird, strained relationship with her dad but on what grounds? I'm not saying that their relationship has to be dissected and spoon-fed to the audience - but the dynamic between them felt unfounded and contrived. I can understand why the dad may have had some supressed resentment towards the daughter, but not once in the movie do we see that in the movie. The daughter slaps his hand away, is hesitant to ask him to come to dinner, runs away - but where is the opposing side? Where is the dad ignoring her or brushing her off? The only scene we get exploring their dynamic isn't even with his daughter but with his son at the waterfall, and yet all the dad says then is 'of course I love my daughter' or whatever. That's it. The climax of the movie is literally him confessing his love for her, but that moment would have had meant something had the movie actually explored the brokenness of their relationship beforehand. 

The relationships themselves in the movie held no weight to me. In the beginning when the son dies we don't see the immediate impact of that loss on the family at all, or the strife it causes with John's character and his daughter. Instead the next scene we get is basically the dad laughing and dancing with his wife in the basement. Granted time has passed, but how much more effective would the aforementioned scene be if at the last shot we see the dad giving a disapproving/bitter look at his daughter? That would set a base of their relationship for the rest of the movie.

If they just made this a simple survival story, a monster flick, a coming of age story, that would have been fine. But it tried to be deeper than it actually was, throwing in elements that were left unattended or unexplored and in the end this was just another generic monster movie (with some admittedly brilliant cinematic moments) glazed over with some baseless, forced sentiment. ",8a5qdo
dxfci97,"Did anyone else feel this movie addressed gender roles really well?

Dad made the boy come out to get supplies with him instead of the girl, even though the boy really didn't want to and the girl really did. People have pointed out to me that there were other reasons for him not bringing the girl (his lingering blame for her part in her brother's death, the fact that she's deaf and therefore it's a bit more dangerous to bring her etc.), but I really do feel like gender roles were a big part of his decision not to bring her. The boy is told more than once throughout the movie that he needs to learn to look after his mother and sister.

Then, at the end, it turns out to be the mother and the sister figuring out how to kill the monsters. It's the girls getting shit done and protecting the family while the boy holds the baby (also a boy) and stays quiet.

The premise was brilliant and this could have been a great movie. But it wasn't.",8a5qdo
dwzjytr,"I feel like a crazy person seeing how great these reviews are and how everyone is loving it but for me it started off with an amazing premise then spiraled downwards in a flame of inconsistency and stupidity. My biggest problem was that most of these could've been fixed. When you create a move with a unique rule around noise you need to be consistent with your rule, in this movie they broke it constantly. I'll list the things that broke the movie for me:

1. Biggest problem was having a child. Seriously? It's just over a year into the outbreak, condoms and birth control are still good to go if you really need to have sex. The first 2-3 years of that child's life they won't be able to stop it from making a noise, they've already lost a child why the hell would they put themselves in that position. It made me hate them for doing basically the worst possible thing they could've in that situation. To fix this they could've moved the Day counter back to day 270 and said she was pregnant before the event, would've made me sympathise with the characters much more.
2. Can they hear breathing or not? I've seen multiple attempts of people trying to explain away the ending by saying ""Oh they can hear you breath"" but at the start of the movie they are within 10 metres from one when it kills the child and later on they are fairly close to the old man and it doesn't go after any of them.
3. The girl's hearing aid affects the monsters yet she just happens to turn it off in time to get her dad killed despite using it against the monster already? They should've not had that scene in the silo and had the only time we see it affect a monster be when it was stalking behind her and she doesn't see it.
4. A monster ambushes them despite being blind and them not making a sound at the end when walking through the cornfield yet one couldn't attack them at the start when they were on the bridge in the open? Be consistent, just have them make a noise to start the attack with the truck.
5. Why not have sirens or other fireworks somewhere set to remote control? Seems like the first thing you would set up would be a remote sound maker within range. The dude is clearly handy with electronics, he sets up a remote camera station and repairs hearing aids, I've done none of that and have made remote controlled noise makers in the past to joke with people.
6. The tone at the end changed to some weird cheesy action movie, what the hell was that?

I really wanted to love this movie but there were way too many plotholes that were blatant, you can forgive a couple but at least be consistent with the rules you create.",8a5qdo
dwzzoz3,"I wanted this movie to be good sooo badly, but honestly...I’m disappointed.

I am fully prepared for this to be down voted into oblivion, but this just my opinion.

I am by no means a film critic, but I kind of thought there were tons of short cuts in this movie. I would have loved a little more back story as to what these creatures are and where they come from. I didn’t feel like panning past newspaper clippings gave us enough information. I’m sure they are aliens, seeing as though they were called “death angels” in one headline, so I assume that means they came down from the sky, I also believe I saw something about a meteor crash....but would love to see how this family has made it this long, and some flashbacks to the initial arrival and the pandemonium that would have ensued would have made it more exciting, but maybe that would have been too much and wouldn’t fit the rest of the movie. 

I didn’t understand why John K’s character didn’t want his daughter going into the basement, what exactly didn’t he want her seeing?

When he lights the fire in the beginning of the movie, and he sees the other fires being lit in the hills, is that how him and surrounding survivors signal to each other that they are still alive?

And I guess I’ll just cut to the ending right now....but that was painfully corny. Emily Blunt might as well said some whack ass one liner like “let’s make some noise” when she racked that shotgun. 

Maybe I went in with too high of expectations....it was hard not to when it scored so high on RT.

when it turns out the animal on the roof is a raccoon and then it gets killed a minute later... like okay it’s day 478 and this raccoon has been living a completely silent life apparently and the moment when it finally dies is one minute after climbing on john krasinskis roof? 😂

or the old couple in the woods... john and son just *happen* to be walking back from a waterfall a few minutes after this dudes wife got destroyed... who was that old guy anyway? you could tell they had some sort of community from the fire signals but why weren’t they like working together on surviving or anything? i dunno, anyway they just happen to come across this guy at a really inopportune moment

In the beginning of the movie, Lee lights a fire at the top of the silo. When the camera pans out, several other fires are lit in the surrounding area, indicating other survivors. Later on, when Regan and her brother light the fire again and the cameras pan out, there are no other fires. 

Does this immediately indicate that they’ve ALL somehow been killed? 

Are they in hiding due to the aliens closing in? 

Were the red areas marked on the map indicating the “territories” of the aliens? 

How many more aliens do you think there are? The density must be very high if there are so many in such a rural area. 

As a side note, I’m a bit disappointed that no captions were included for the speaking parts.

A lot of reliance on jump scares despite legitimately great horror idea and monsters which was somewhat annoying.

dx3vptt,"I left the theater really underwhelmed by this movie. It feels like I've seen everything in it a million times before and it tries to be way deeper than it actually is. 

Dad is hyper-competent and really concerned about gender roles, boy kid is a moron who by all rights should have been dead 10 times over, girl kid is handicapped and therefore special and key to defeating the monsters, mom is a useless housewife that gets bailed out in the nick of time in multiple instances, and of course everyone has a troubled past because *they let the 4 year old walk in the back of the group in the apocalypse*.

They also held nothing back in showing you the threat and the creatures became only scary instead of terrifying once you actually saw them. This is the problem with so many monster movies, and it's really tiring.

And the final shot of the ""badass"" shotgun pump just made me shake my head. I *get* the idea of ""Okay, now's our chance"" but in a meta sense, ending it there was nothing short of hilariously tone-deaf (no pun intended). This family is 5 minutes out from dad getting ripped in half and mom puts on a John McClane grin and pumps a shotgun. I was already pretty lukewarm but that sealed it for me.

It reminded me a lot of It Comes At Night or bits of Annihilation, except Night at least had the decency to leave you wanting more because it was so suspenseful, and Annihilation at least made the creatures varied, creepy, and interesting. I'm really surprised that this movie is getting so much praise. It just felt like Tremors except without the comedy and with way too much melodrama.",8a5qdo
dwzh2rf,"I’m really not understanding the praise for this movie. There were a number of plot holes that aggravated me. The entire plot of the movie revolves around the characters making stupid decisions.

6/10",8a5qdo
dww68bd,"I thought it was a very frustrating movie. Not bad, just frustrating. The following will be a bit rambling because I'm trying to get it all out as fast as I can. 

SPOILERS BELOW. PLEASE DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

 I would have liked to have much less of a score involved. Thought the music was intrusive. The silence was there for parts of the film but I didn't find it as deafening as it should have been. The movie doesn't trust it's audience. Why do we have to see cliche news clippings and white-board writings (""What is their weakness,"" ""It's SOUND""). The Road accomplished this much better. You simply understood the world.

Every single situation in which noise alerts the creatures is due to stupidity. If he had that shelter for the baby built that was soundproof why didn't they just mostly hide in there? Why is she chancing carrying TWO HUGE SATCHELS of laundry up creaky stairs while being pregnant? Why does she tug the bag harder when it's clearly caught on something? It's uneven. 

Anyway I mentally checked out by the time the nail came into play. The danger can't come from something that feels so artificial for me. Many of the dangers felt like they came from cheesy scary movies. This movie's premise should have made it taut and thrilling.

I thought the daughter character was completely annoying. It wasn't reasonably established why she would be so upset. He's keeping you all safe, YOU caused your brother to be killed, he's trying to fix YOUR hearing aid, of course he loves you... It was corny to me that she had to see how many hearing aids he went through to understand how much he was trying. Jesus Christ, we're more than a year into the apocalypse. 

I thought the goal of Krasinski's character wasn't fleshed out. 473 days into the apocalypse and he's only checked off like half of the available signals/frequencies? I only make this point because it doesn't really seem like much happens in the movie. The beginning death. Flash forward. John Krasinski won't take his daughter to the place. Space ship. Baby. Fireworks. Hearing aid. End.

I just didn't believe their attempts to be quiet. Nothing was as desperate as it should have been. During the birth why is she not shoving her fucking fist in her mouth? Or anything. Like literally put a fucking sock in it. That's a minor gripe honestly. EDIT: Also when the brother and sister were in the car at the end and he actually yells out ""Dad!"" 

I've run out of steam so I'm just going to stop here. Sorry to offend anyone who liked it.

EDIT 2: Why didn't he want the daughter to go down there? What was embarrassing/shameful/harmful about her seeing the amount of hearing aids he worked on? Also there were jump scares present in the film. I really wasn't expecting the film to rely on several of them. 

Call me out on any criticism you think is unfair. I'd love to talk about it.
",8a5qdo
dwz9w39,"I really don't know how this currently has a 97% on RT. It's pretty cool and somewhat unique that there isn't much dialogue but it's a story we've seen many times before (post apocalyptic survival with monsters) and the finale is pretty predictable and generic. A monster with supersonic hearing? Who would have guessed, it's weakness is loud frequency feedback?! Waiting on the next one to see the monsters with excellent vision who get fucked up in the end because the protagonist uses flares in their face. Prepared for the downvotes people are going to hand me because they liked the movie and can't handle someone not liking it, since that seems to be a common thing in this thread.

Also, to anyone wanting to see this who hasn't yet, wait a week or two for the crowds to clear out. The movie is very quiet (obviously) and you could pretty much hear a piece of popcorn hit the ground. Unless you wanna hear people whispering to each other, smacking popcorn, slurping drinks, and fumbling with candy wrappers, then you should wait a little.",8a5qdo
dxji3ag,"The most overrated movie i’ve seen in quite some time. The first half was good, but as soon as the women had her baby, it was all downhill from there. No barricades, traps, or doors to combat/defend against these monsters which is just idiotic, especially after 470+ days. 

The ending was pretty much a ripoff of Signs. They found the weakness in front of the alien while the whole family is in the same room, but the only difference is no “Gary, Swing away” in this one. What killed an alien in Signs? Water. Something completely unexpected to the characters, but the more you think about it, it’s kinda stupid that aliens would come here when the planet is made up of 75% water. What kills the aliens in this one? High frequency almost does along with some bullets, which is something the characters should’ve known after 470+ days. Heck, the world should’ve found that out pretty quick. 

If the aliens avoid the river and waterfall for some odd reason, move near there! You can talk there, you could wear shoes and walk around normally, and they wouldn’t hear the baby being born. 

The baby was quiet in the most convenient places, and louder in places to make sure the movie had tension. Babies cry a lot and i was honestly expecting it to die considering how easily the aliens got in the house. 

The aliens are attracted to sound, but only when the director wants them to be. There’s parts where stuff drops, no alien shows up. Another part where the women gives birth and drops some stuff or steps on the nail, oh look, an alien showed up!

These things can run fast, as it’s shown a lot, but they sure do take their sweet time to get into that silo after the door fell. 

I’m kinda wondering what would happen if one of these people ended up snoring, talking in their sleep, coughing, sneezing, throwing up (for the pregnant mother), or just making any other uncontrollable noise. Also, would a silenced gun attract more aliens after you killed one with it? 

I do like that they casted a deaf girl and had some scenes in her POV, sadly they only go to it just to make a jump scare the next second. I feel like more could’ve been done with her and love the moments where the alien creeps up, no sound is playing, and is just pure tension. 

Overall, i’m confused at where all this praise for this movie is coming from. It has a good cast that does fine in their roles, but all logic is pretty much thrown out the window. It’s cool that people from other genres are trying their hand at horror like Jordan Peele did last year, but unfortunately this is nowhere near as good as Get Out. The nice thing is besides all the plotholes, the movie still did hold my attention and didn’t feel long. I kinda wish it was a bit longer to explain how these aliens got here since they’re blind, pad out some plotholes, make more sense of how they survived after all that time, etc. 

If you do plan on seeing it, avoid the trailers as well because they actually revealed the monsters in them and some key moments 🙄.

dyh8f7k,"I though this was pretty terrible, there were a lot of plot holes:

* How does their farm have electricity??
* Why would they not live closer to major white noise like that waterfall, or choose to give birth there at least?
* Why is it that the slightest noise they make is met with half a dozen creatures doing everything they can to eat them, yet there are still apparently plenty of woodland creatures about (racooons, etc)?
* If these things actually kill/eat every living thing within a few moments of it making a noise, then after the year+ that they've been on earth, how are they still alive, because surely they've killed most of their food by now?
* If there was enough of a lag time between the invasion and the post-apocalyptic life, enough time for there to be weeks/months worth of newspaper headlines, how is it possible that the nobody (even the military??) managed to come up with ""let's shoot really high-pitched noise at them""???
* If you knew your entire family's life depended on being quiet, why the fuck would you blow in your wife and risk a baby??
* At the end, how the fuck did a pickup truck careening down a hillside not cause a fuckload of noise, regardless of whether or not the engine was off??

dx02qc3,"The movie was stressful and suspenseful, I’ll give it that. However.. the thing about the monsters’ weakness was so predictable. It was also really stupid. There were newspapers in the movie of scenes with soldiers fighting the monsters and it said “they’re indestructible” yet a shotgun blast did one in instantly. 

On top of that I’m sure the world’s miltaries and governments would think to try blasting them with all sorts of sound frequencies considering they’re based solely on sound to perceive the world. Also, giant white noise generators would make them unable to find anything.

It can’t get through a 1980s f150 and you want me to believe it had any effect on an IFV or especially a tank?

Hey All! 
I have just returned from my first screening of ""A Quiet Place"" and I must say it was truly an amazing film. After leaving the theater I had a few questions on the possible origins of the Creatures/Monsters/Aliens acting as the antagonists of the film. 

Within the film, there is no clear beginning of the invasion of the sightless creatures other than the news paper articles you can see on the walls of the houses or in the stores of the opening shots of the film. Based on the anatomy and structure of the monsters, I theorized that instead of the creatures being considered *alien* or from another world that they are actually from the subsurface crust of Earth. 
These creatures share a number of characteristics with existing organisms that live subsurface mainly being the main point of the film, **they lack the ability to see.** Living underground in the darkness nullifies the point of having the ability to see and their **very very* sensitive hearing would allow them to detect any available prey underground. 

Moving forward, their elongated legs/arms contain absolutely terrifying claws to top them off. As seen in the film, they have the ability to pierce steal and metal thus allowing us to theorize they could be used to cut rock away and allow them to be decent burrowers. It's a long stretch to say they had burrows all around the world, but hey you never know!

This theory is just a work in progress and I will come back after a possible second screening, but I highly recommend this film! It is an absolute one of a kind! Any sort of additions to this theory or criticism is welcome!",8a5qdo

Although, I had an entire theatre full of oblivious people: talking at full volume, dropping plastic tray, chewing as loudly as possible, using flashlights to find the dropped trays, and a final phone ring to top it off. Was never immersed fully, sadly. I wonder how it would have effected my final rating: 7/10. ",8a5qdo
dxacr11,"I loved it, until the last 15 minutes.

The way the world was built up, the kind of struggle this family had been going through to survive, to their novel approach of survival methods, all of it was awesome and interesting.

It was compelling enough just seeing how they survived as a family, and the emotional consequences of the scary new world they found themselves in.

The acting was solid all the way through, it felt like there was a good connection between characters, they really sold a family surviving under extreme circumstances... And everyone played their parts well. 

But the last 15 minutes *almost* ruined it all for me. From the dad's death feeling so unfortunately artificial, like so much was built up just to sacrifice him in a big ""I love you"" moment to satisfy the rift between him and his daughter, to the, what upset me far more, final 5 seconds where it felt like a total genre flip that the careful, slow build up didn't deserve. I felt like it was a slap in the face, almost. Like, you're going to suck me in just to force a moment to try to tug at my heart, then leave the conclusion so unsatisfying by a complete 180 in tone to leave us off on?

- letting the youngest child walk behind all of them in an alien infested forest. Although, to be fair, they do show the mother suffering from guilt for this.


- making the deaf child feel neglected and unloved to the extent that she needs to take actions that undermine everyone's safety, in an act of 'rebellion'. To be fair again, this can be chalked up just to 'teens being teens', but I'd expect the parents to be more aware of it.

- and finally, no matter how much guilty you feel, bringing a child into this kind of a world is a bad, BAD idea.

dx09fk9,"I didn't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece by any stretch. However, I really love the premise so I was hoping the movie would explore it in very clever and intelligent ways. I wouldn't even mind that it had jump scares (which I usually despise just on principal), given that those types of scares would actually make sense in the context of the story and the world the characters occupy. So with all those things in mind, this movie left me extremely disappointed. It just feels like a huge waste of a great premise. 

Things I liked:

-The intro up to the opening title was pretty great stuff. It sets up what could have been a great movie by letting you know right away: ""We're not fucking around here. You make a noise or do something dumb, and you're dead where you stand."" Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the ""promise"" of that intro. 

-The soundproof baby box thing was really clever. I wanted to see more of that kind of stuff where the characters solved regular, inevitable problems in very smart ways. 

-Some of the little clever details that they already showed off in the trailers (using sand to walk around, marking spots to walk on the wooden floor that won't creak, etc.)

That's about all I can think of as far as what I really liked. The problem is the rest of the movie pretty much renders a lot of the cleverness as being kind of pointless because the plot is pushed forward through the most contrived set ups or the ""rules"" are very inconsistent. Seeing the setup of the nail sticking up in the staircase was the moment where I realized the movie was going to lose me and start to go downhill. They thought to paint every spot in the house where you could safely step, but they didn't see the nail on the stair and think ""Hmm, maybe we should pull that out or safely cover it somehow, just in case."" This is the fundamental issue with the movie. There's no consistency in the logic of the characters or the rules of the world. The plot is advanced through contrived conveniences and inconveniences, rather than the characters making choices that bear consequences (with the exception of the intro). 

Since the plot is driven by contrivances and/or dumb character moments, I ended up not really caring about anyone. And since I didn't care about anyone, I was just kind of bored by all of the ""tense"" scenes and ""scares."" Maybe it's just the direction, but I found them to be kind of bland and predictable. I won't say they're poorly done, but it's never anything that feels fresh or inventive in the way it plays with the premise. For instance, there's never a scare or sequence built solely around the concept of quiet. What I mean by that is they don't play with the idea of creating a ""scare"" through silence, or playing with the audience in that way. A perfect example of this is the first time you actually see the shark in Jaws. Up to that moment, the audience had been conditioned to feel the presence of the shark and all of the scares mostly through sound cues. When they reveal the shark, it's actually a very quiet moment, but it still takes you by surprise (if you haven't already seen the movie). A Quiet Place dips it toes with the idea of complete silence briefly when they first setup the hearing aid frequency hurting the monsters, but how cool would it have been to have an entire ""scary"" sequence built around keeping us in the perspective of the daughter? Instead, we just get your run of the mill ""Monster in the basement""/""Monster in the cornfield""/""Monster in the hallway"" kind of stuff. It's nothing that someone like, say, Spielberg hasn't already done far better in half a dozen of his movies. A tense scene being predictable isn't necessarily a bad thing, but a good director will pull you in even when you think you know where a scene is going. Another good comparison for an effective build of tension in a scene would be the [screaming skull bear](#spoiler) scene from Annihilation. 

Another issue I had is that I didn't really buy or particularly care about the drama within the family. Given how much time that passes between the intro and the 400-something days later, it feels like the conflict between the father and daughter either would have been dealt with by then or it would have been far more pronounced and a much bigger issue for the characters than it was in the movie. I think that concept of guilt could have been explored in a very interesting way, but the movie doesn't really go anywhere meaningful with it. As a viewer, you just kind of know (or at least feel) that of course he loves his daughter. He obviously cares about her well-being so why is there even an issue here? Had they actually gone in the direction of the father noticeably resenting his daughter, that conflict might have had a little more weight to it, but it just kind of feels like ""oh yeah, here's this little bit of drama but it's just whatever, I guess.""

So overall, I'm just disappointed at how contrived 90% of the things in this movie were. What little I did like wasn't nearly enough to carry it for me. There's a whole lot of potential and inklings of interesting ideas and moments, but despite a really promising opening, the rest of the movie just doesn't deliver. ",8a5qdo
dx3yj9o,"Ok i need help with this movie please
I have just watched this and i need some answers

If there were 3 creatures in the area as the board said,Why not make 3 noises and  just shoot them?

Do they only go to the specific spot of noise as per the old man and child? If so why did they hang around the house so long in the last part of the movie?

Surely if they know they are noise related creatures then a sound weapon would be obvious?

Why wouldnt he let the girl go downstairs?

Why not just wrap carpet on feet instead of sand ?

Why not live on a boat near the noisy water?


What are the fires lit  everynight?

Why have a child?????

dx3q44u,"Loved this movie, but so upset that Jim had to die.   He didn't have to die.  And as a father, my self, hated how the daughter's defiance from the beginning of the movie until the end got everyone  or almost got everyone in her family killed. 

1.  Her parents were adamant that the spaceship toy was a firm no-no.  But fuck logic and orders from her parents.  She takes it upon herself to let baby bro take the bait and get snatched up while the family watches.

2. Her dad told her to stay with her mother and help her.  Did she listen?  Of course not.  And what happens?  Mom struggles with the laundry because her daughter did not stick around to help her.  Pries the nail upward with the sack of laundry and sets up all of the events that follow.  Mom almost dies.  Baby almost dies.  

3.  She finds her other brother and they make it to the top of the silo.  Bro tells her to hold the position because dad will find them.  She refuses to succumb to reason and he falls in trying to stop her from leaving.  He almost dies.  She almost dies.  

4.  After everything.  You get the feeling her hearing aid was able to defer two of these things successfully.  When they're in the silo and the creature jumps in.  Her hearing aid goes crazy.  She knows that.  The thing goes crazy and jumps through the wall of the building.  She didn't put that together?  What else would have made her device go crazy and the creature go crazy?  Even still, she didn't put it together.  So her dad dies due to all of the events she put in motion at every turn.  She messed up at every turn.  She didn't listen, no pun intended, at every turn.   She was infuriating and I hated that Jim died.

- First of all, there's no way creatures like this would ever be able to destroy society. Yes, they're fast and strong, but I definitely don't believe they can stand bullets, let alone stand a chance vs attack choppers.
- How bad of a parent do you have to be to just let a small child run around when the slightest sound could kill you. Why is that child walking in the back?
- How does their hearing work exactly? They hear a lamp fall over miles away, but they can't hear you panting? They can't just hear your heartbeat?
- Oh, you can just shoot them in the face, it kills them. Why hasn't anybody tried that before?

Seems to me that the monster could have been trapped easily, because it was so attracted to noise. So how about building traps like in the Predator... or Home Alone for chrissakes? Even without guns or explosives there are a lot of stuff you could do instead of just living the farm life like in the movie. Even punji stick would help defend the house. Besides, if the waterfall masked the noise so well, why didn’t anyone live next to it?

If anything, the acting had to be and was phenomenal. For an entire character to only have 50 words all movie long you really needed to nail it.

My favorite parts were the scenes of love. You could truly feel how each of them felt about each other. The loss, the willingness to do anything, the hope for the future and the remembrance of the past.

dwyacse,"Okay, I know this will inevitably be lost since there are already 2k comments, but i just got out of the movie. So... here is my 2 cents on why I think it wasn't that great (I gave it a 6 in the poll).

First and foremost we don't have any backstory as to where these things came from. What brought them here / created them / etc... Suspending belief for a moment, I'll continue onto what I didn't understand during this time-

1) We start in a supermarket / pharmacy. So, you'd think if Mr. And Mrs. Quiet plan to make babies (hi, main plot of the movie!) They'd perhaps get some sort of contraceptives...? They easily could have grabbed condoms from this place in preparation.

2) The child was told not to take the thing as it was too loud, but the sister gave it to him anyways. That's fine, it's a cute/nice thing to do... But did he seriously put the batteries in the CORRECT way at 4 and turn it on after everyone said it was too loud? If he's able to understand how to put batteries in the correct way, he should understand noise kills in this future. 

3) The main premise of the movie now turns to the fact she's pregnant and she'll ultimately have this baby. WHY is she pregnant? They damn well knew they wouldn't be able to keep the baby quiet, they never should have conceived another. That's just stupid.

4) The bag gets pull from something... The natural reaction would be to SEE what caused it to prevent it in the future. That nail never should have been up in the first place.

5) Okay, the nail penetrated her foot. Surely you'll fix this now before the movie goes forward since you have plenty of time? Oh, okay.

6) The daughter didn't understand the hearing aid the first time it made the noise, but it was pretty damn evident the second time. SO WHY DID SHE TURN IT OFF IN THE CAR WHICH ULTIMATELY KILLED HER FATHER?

Those are my gripes, and I feel they're rather large ones. They can't whisper, but a glass lamp breaking makes them freak out but no monster comes? So why not just... Whisper? No need to sign language for everyone.  Also, we never got a clear explanation as to why he didn't bring his daughter fishing. Also also... The old man had been living for over a year in silent zone, so what caused his wife to be attacked, and then why the fuck did he scream even though he saw there was a child? That whole scene made no sense.

Anywho, that's just my $0.02",8a5qdo
dwyb9zw,"I thought this movie was as realistic as it could probably get in that situation.
Also, going after that pill bottle was a risky move.

1. Why didn't the father want his daughter to go downstairs into that basement room? It seemed like he was worried she's scream or make too much noise if she went down there. Why? It took me ages to figure out that it was the radio room. I was under the impression it was holding some deep dark secret because the whole house had been abandoned, like an alien nest or something. 

2. That part where the father lights the fight and we see a bunch of other fires, was that meant to be other survivors?

3. Is it really plausible that it would have taken them that long to figure out that a creature reliant on sound would also weaker to higher frequency of noises? Wouldn't the military have figured that out?

4. Why didn't the father just throw the axe and make another noise, instead of sacrificing himself? My assumption is no matter what, the aliens are able to hone in on their target once they hear something.

5. Do the aliens actually EAT what they kill, or is it reasonable to assume they just kill things BECAUSE they're so sensitive to sound and they just want to shut them up?

I also couldn't help wondering about the things I've seen other people mention in terms of whether that weakness with the sound frequency wouldn't have been discovered earlier, why weren't people setting off small fireworks/bombs for distraction -- but in the end, it didn't matter to me while I was watching it any more than the question of where the aliens came from. What mattered was this weird, isolated, terrifying world these people were dropped into, and how they tried to survive in it, and that was perfectly executed. 

I didn't think the pregnancy storyline was too implausible -- while I can't imagine for a second that any sensible couple would deliberately conceive a baby under those circumstances, accidents happen; plus if you do the math, the baby would have been conceived a couple of months after their youngest child was killed. It's clear that they both feel tremendous guilt over that, especially the wife (""I could have carried him"") and they were probably just trying to comfort each other. It's easy to get reckless when you're depressed and can barely think past next week, and birth control might have either failed or long since become unavailable. They did have the soundproof room with the lidded crib for backup; not a great place to spend your infant/toddler years but better than the alternative. 

(I did wonder why we never saw her trying to nurse the baby; newborns will root and try to nurse constantly, and if you want to keep them from crying that's a good way to do it. Admittedly it would have been tough to have her racking a shotgun with the baby eating away at the same time.)",8a5qdo

Good performances and narrative progression but I might have enjoyed it more had they ventured off the farm and we could have seen more of the impact of the invasion and an explanation as to why the military weren't able to develop an audio device to stun the aliens and then take them out which is what would realistically happen. 7/10",8a5qdo

This video explores how A Quiet Place used sound design to craft its narrative. ",8a5qdo
dx77qng,"I liked this movie. It's not 97/100 good, but here are my thoughts on it:

* Biggest issue the movie had was WAYYYYY too much monster. The movie set it up like sound was the real monster, and the creatures were just a force of nature responding to it. So either barely show the creatures or wait until the very end to show them off. Monster combat-rolling into the little kid? Good. Monster coming up from behind suicidal old man to kill him? Good. Monster running to the grain silo, and you see the corn it's displacing more than the monster itself? GREAT. Showing the monster flex its face flaps and ear holes in full frame, fully lit, for several seconds, multiple times in the movie? Cheapens it severely. Some people like seeing big CGI monsters full screen, and in the right movie I do too, but in something like this it was just wrong. I was way more affected by those tense moments after someone made a noise than I was by the chase scene that followed.

* Fireworks masking Emily Blunt's scream was retarded. The monster the next room over doesn't understand proximity?

* Maybe take off the hearing aid before you use it to incapacitate the monster? It clearly causes you a ton of pain to use it, and as we see at the end you don't need to have it in to use it as a weapon

* Deaf girl's actions directly result in the death of her brother and indirectly result in the death of her father. Quit trying to make me sympathize with an idiot fuckup, movie, it's not going to work.

* Deaf girl also has whiny emotional outbursts that are hard to care about given they're all pointless. Dad doesn't want you in his room full of loud sound equipment? Bitch about it. Dad wants you to stay with your heavily pregnant mother while he and your brother go fetch food? Bitch about it, then run away from home into a forest full of death machines. Crisis involving said death machines where you're separated from your parents? Immediately try to run off on your own when you have no proof your parents have been killed AND you're completely safe as long as you don't make any noise, leading to your brother falling into a grain silo as he tries to get into your field of vision to sign to you, a sequence of events that leads to the death of your father.

* When the deaf girl ran off to the memorial, I thought she was going to turn on the toy, set it on the ground, and just stare off into space with the sound muted as a creature comes in to kill her in complete silence. That would have been the best scene of the movie.

* To those saying the old man is an asshole, I think the reason he chose to scream when he did was *because* Lee told him to be quiet. I imagine the old man was disgusted by how little Lee cared about the one thing the old man had left in his life being dead, and reducing it to ""be quiet"". Was probably spite. Though I thought the guy would scream and then run after Lee+son, which would have been nightmare fuel.

* The hose turning on and flooding the safe room was super contrived and took me out of the movie.

* The creatures never had any real definition to their hearing abilities. Cracking a lantern inside of a house hundreds of feet away from the nearest monster is a deadly noise, but *four people* heavy breathing within spitting distance isn't?

* I didn't know pickup trucks were made with plot armor

* That ending was just terrible. Went from solid horror-thriller to laughable shlock in seconds. We just watched the ultimate showdown between the remains of the Abbott family and a single monster, and right after that climax finishes, you decide to make the vulnerable Emily Blunt into a badass action star? Just terrible. 

* Jesus christ, warn your family about the nail. She didn't even point to it, and there's *no reason* she wouldn't warn her kids about it. The movie kept coyly showing it, baiting the audience into thinking it will happen again, but the only reason it could happen again is Emily Blunt doing what she did, which was ignore the thing that almost got her killed and not tell her kids about it.

* Why did Emily Blunt crawl out of the tub, into the shower?

* In a movie where the slightest sound can spell death, it's a shame it kept going for the most basic jumpscare bait. Old man in the woods, raccoon dropping off the roof, raccoon getting stomped, bloody hand in the shower...I guess they just blew their load with that fantastic first death and ran out of ideas after.",8a5qdo
dwwfjpi,This movie was a mess. Utterly astounded at people who felt it was unpredictable.,8a5qdo
dwwwn2y,"I saw this movie last night and I still don't know 100% how I feel. I'm not really a horror flick guy, but checked this out due to the hype and with Moviepass, hey it's free. And I felt underwhelmed due to the hype. But overall still an above average movie and as horror movies go, a better one than most in recent years.

I mean technically it's a fantastic film. The semi original story was great. The acting with just facial and body language was top notch. Like, I felt the terror in the son in every scene. Krasinski’s facial expression convened so much emotion. The background music a good touch. Not an over abundance reliance on the jump scare tactic and when used wasn’t cheesy. This is a film that John Krasinski should be proud of. As director he made excellent decisions for the film. 

But at the same time...it just felt off for me. Some minor changes, especially to the timeline, would have made for a better experience, in my opinion. I liked the story, but it revolved around the pregnancy which is just a stupid premise...""hey we have to be quiet to survive...let's have a tiny human that can't control its own noises""..I feel like that problem could have been easily fixed by just altering the timeline...keep the story exactly the same, but make Emily's character already pregnant when the monsters came and setting the movie within 9 months of the ""invasion"" instead of over a year away and making having a baby an active (stupid) decision. You have the same dread and tension…but now it’s more impactful cause when family planning you weren’t expecting to survive in this world. By making the active decision to have a baby in the current circumstances…you’re kind of asking for trouble.

Another issue with timeline is the discovery of the monsters themselves. The movie pointed out, thanks to clipped media, that there were enough attacks from these creatures to run multiple headlines. Which means it was kinda of a slow advance (few days at least) for them to overrun America and probably the world...I find it with that timing and already knowing the monster's reaction to noise, the military would have had responded with noise/frequency attacks. But nope...it took a deaf girl to figure it out after witnessing it 3-4 times how the monsters reacted to the feedback of her implant/hearing aid. This problem again could have been easily fixed by altering the timeline. Make the “invasion” quicker so there wasn’t time for news like that...or you know don’t even have the newspapers at all. Or change the ending to where the military came in, eluding that they figured it out and that there are some clusters of the monsters in rural areas that the military are slowly combating.

As I left the theater I overheard conversations of people being in dread and on the edge of their seats the whole movie, which a great horror movie should do. But for me, I only felt that way for way for a couple of scenes. They set the tone early with the youngest child's death...but then I felt the tension washed away completely by having such a big time jump and showing the family fairly well adjusted on the outside. I don’t mind a time jump but such a large one removed the tension and I feel like the grieving and the built up conflict between the daughter and the father would have been more pronounced. 
",8a5qdo
dwyrdci,"Loved this movie.
The ONLY thing that would've made it perfect for me is if Krasinski's character was not actually their father, he was a step father. It would've better explained why she doubted his love so much and would've made his sacrifice much more moving for me personally. To add to this - the younger kid who is killed at the beginning could've been Krasinski's / Blunt's child, making his assumed blame on her more believable and her guilt even deeper. This would also setup nicely a reason for them to try for another baby together.",8a5qdo

Overall i enjoyed the movie though,8a5qdo
dxf12te,"Absolutely amazing movie. The sacrifice of the father at the end reminds me of Train to Busan, another amazing film. Both movies are essentially about the importance of fatherly or familial love in the face of despair and danger, about sacrificing oneself in order to save a loved one. 

And it's both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time at the moment near the end, when the remaining family members were protected by the sound emitting from the device made by the father-an act of love for his deaf daughter in order for her to be able to hear. Because of his love for her, he is able to unknowingly protect his entire family even when he's already dead. Fuuuckkkk it pains me whyyyy *gross crying*

I'm a bit confused by the ending, or more specifically, about the number of aliens at the end. Many people say that there were only 2 left and coming to the house because it was written on the whiteboard by the father that there were 3 monsters within the area, so there were only 3 monsters all-in-all and the mother is able to kill them all due to only having 2 more to kill, and besides, they have enough shells. But my brothers insist that there were more coming to the house, at least ten more, because it was shown in each CCTV that many more aliens were quickly coming (or maybe it's just my eyes playing tricks on me). And many more (maybe even from the city) would be coming because of the loud-ass fireworks going off at their place. In short, they're still f**ked because they don't have enough ammo to kill plenty of those aliens. 

I'm desperately hoping it's the former. I need reassurance that they get to live, and the father's sacrifice was not in vain after all.
",8a5qdo
dxgolmm,"I'm very disappointed. With a 8.1 IMDB I was expecting an intelligent horror movie. Instead we got a movie where things only happened the way they were because the people in that universe are somehow too stupid to exploit the monster's glaring weakness.

Quite a few people in the theater were audibly laughing and made the last few minutes of the film take on a slightly different meaning.

I feel like they made such an effort to do things to keep quiet, as opposed to thinking of ways to make their lives easier. It's makes me think of the whole ""work smarter, not harder,"" saying. 

Ok we have a coffin etc for our baby, but having a pacifier or something to use as one doesn't occur to them? And I know it's not particularly nice but they wouldn't consider putting a hand over the baby's mouth when it's crying 3 feet away from the monster? 

As other people in the thread have mentioned - why wouldn't they set up a speaker or something to make noise that is away from the house? 

Could they not carry shit around with them to throw and distract the monsters if needed? Like the timer ya know? 

I mean...I still would say I liked it, but why not think about things like this instead of making homemade Monopoly pieces? ",8a5qdo

dxfir0a,"Exciting premise, quite good acting. Very good atmosphere building. Movie peaked at the I-Stepped-on-the-Nail-must-give-birth scene.

After that everything about the movie flatlined. These fearsome light speed monsters with precision 1 shot kill ability failed miserably to live up to their own abilities. Each character confronted them multiple times and escaped. From a point on the terror departed and the atmosphere collapsed. You knew were this was going. The only character killed was the one who chose to be killed.

The final scene was meh. Post apocalyptic dramas need something more than a complete victory of the good guys. Take example from ""the Road"" or ""the Survivalist"", or even ""Carriers""",8a5qdo
dxfwqsj,Is Emily Blunt attractive? ,8a5qdo
dxgq9wi,"Well directed, well acted and some really nice sound design here and there but I felt the script was seriously flawed on the level of a Sci Fi channel original and massively held it back, overall it's a 5/10 film for me, slightly above average for the genre but not much more than that. Go in with those expectations and you'll have a good time. All these 8/10 reviews gave me high hopes and my partner and I were extremely disappointed/bemused at what we saw.

One look at the previous works of the 2 main writers explains it all really, it's such a shame as the general concept is decent and Krasinski did a great job but outside of the concept the writers clearly had no idea where to go with the plot and the writing in general felt very amateur. As stated at the top, it's basically a sci fi original with a bigger budget.

It's so bizarre how Hollywood keeps doing this, the movie had a decent budget for a horror film but no matter how much money you pour into the visuals, actors, director etc if you skimp out on the script and get a couple of guys with a terrible track record it's going to fall short. ",8a5qdo
dxgtolt,"I can appreciate the attention to detail with certain things, I overall liked the movie, and the sequence with her giving birth and the fireworks going off was cool. Maybe a few too many faux jump scares. My main gripe was in how these adults could worry so much about protecting the kids while not really supervising them at all, you can't be going to a store and let the kids dawdle off somewhere, you don't let the young boy bring up the rear when leaving, you don't go off and do laundry while deaf girl goes wherever she wants to, you don't have another kid among this nonsense, you stick together, you stay in teams, and any kid that gets someone killed and then nearly does it again because they had to play monopoly gets a swift judo chop to the throat.

dx154nt,"So first of all, I would like to say that overall, this was a really amazing movie; definitely one of the best, if not the best new horrors to come out.  Action was great, premise was unique, and the monsters has a very interesting design.  Definitely something you can watch and get immersed in and walk out with great spooks.  However, I'm the type of person that really overthinks things and there are a ton of logical/physical implausibilities that I noticed in the film.  WARNING: LARGE TEXT BLOCKS AHEAD.



EDIT: For those arguing grain entrapment, here's an educational video explaining why it occurs.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhIq87HPkT0  1:12 specifically talks about the conditions needed.  In the movie, the grain in the silo was totally flat (not collapsing) and was not flowing.  No conditions for grain entrapment are satisified, so no, you won't sink into it.



1.  Okay, the monsters are highly armored.  Smaller ammunition wouldn't scratch it.  However, the film seems to be set in modern day as it showed the date 2016, so I'm assuming military power is modern as well.  Well, modern military also has an issue dealing with highly armored targets, so they designed weapons to deal with that, specifically anti-material rounds, or even anti-tank rounds.  These can punch through up to a foot of straight up concrete for the more powerful rounds, and are usually fired with stunning accuracy from a considerable distance.  The monster's armor looked not more than an inch thick and looked to be organic/bone based.  I don't care how strong that armor is, we can still punch through it.


2.  Okay, the monsters have armor made of solid vibranium™.  Any bullet, no matter how powerful is stopped on impact.  That still doesn't mean the monsters are invincible.  Soldiers have bullet resistant vests that can stop pretty heavy rounds too.  However, they are still in mortal danger when shot, even if the bullet was stopped, because of momentum.  That bullet will impart force into the soldier's internal organs and cause massive damage even if it doesn't enter skin.  The monsters seem to be entirely fleshy beneath the armor with no form of padding/force dispersion at all, so laying waste to one with a machine gun will pound the inside into mush, even though the armor would remain unscratched.


3.  Okay, the monsters are magical such that any bullet that even grazes their armor loses all momentum and falls to the ground.  Their flesh seems to have normal fleshy properties according to the end scene.  Humans have dealt with highly armored targets without projectiles for thousands of years.  All you have to do is jam a long pointy object in between the armor plates and that's that.  The monsters are blind and the armor plates aren't even tightly layered, unlike medieval knights who were impaled by accurately thrusted spears or swords.  A savvy human could quietly sneak up on a sleeping monster (they appeared to be stationary when not actively hunting) and just jab a long knife through the gaps of the head and kill it.


4.  Okay, in this universe, humanity has never developed anti-armor rounds or swords.  They have fire and explosives though.  A missile/bomb/grenade to the face would do a monster in no problem.  Though many think explosives kill with shrapnel, the deadliest part of a bomb is the shockwave that will pass through armor and wreck your soft insides.  Heck, even a flamethrower could heat up the insides enough to kill them.



5.  Okay, the monsters are divine deities with holy protection from everything except when they are frazzled by high frequency sound.  Fine.  Let's go to Jim's (he will always be Jim to me) false death scene.  He is the senior, most experienced, most careful character in the film.  He checks around him before leaving the shelter of the barn with his axe for protection.  Sounds okay so far.  He stands completely still and quiet outside the barn to look for the monster.  Sounds good.  Suddenly, a completely still, and completely silent monster was waiting on the rooftop behind him and can somehow see Jim.  No sound was made.  No jarring movement from him.  He was just silently walking and standing still.  He is detected.  However, in every other scene with the monster, hunted characters were crying, breathing heavily, and panicking, and doing a lot more than Jim was while the monster was actively hunting them, and they were never detected.  What?


6.  Okay, enough with the monsters, they just do their own thing.  Let's move on to the most frustrating scene for me which was really meant to be one of the most climactic: the silo scene.  The little kid falls into the corn silo and suddenly, it turns into hyper quicksand.  What?  That's not how quicksand works and it's definitely not how a pile of corn sitting flat in a silo works.  There are two options: The film obeys real world physics, and the kid falls into the corn silo, has the wind knocked out of him, but is relatively unscathed (some bones would probably have broken but I'll let that slide).  The kid can walk around on the corn like you can would around on a pile of gravel.  That's real physics.  Or, the film has it's own special quicksand physics and the corn is actually a liquid.  The kids are only safe on a wide metal door with a lot of surface area.  Okay.  Suddenly the monster bursts in.  And it STANDS ON THE CORN.  It's shown as a quadrupedal creature with very spindly legs, much thinner than a human body.  That thing should've immediately sank up to it's shoulder joints in corny goodness.  So the film is something in between where humans do not follow the laws of physics but the monsters do.  Magical.


Finally, I have a lot of issues with the character choices made in the film.   However, this can be kind of reasonably hand waved off as human stupidity (especially mini human stupidity).  All I have to say is that I would expect someone who has survived 90 days in this apocalypse to be wiser than usual, and I would especially expect someone who has survived 600 days in this hell to be super duper wise.


All in all, it was an exciting film that gave me a great thrill when watching.  It's just that, after thinking about it, and thinking about it, and thinking about it even more, some things started to fall apart.  However, I would still definitely recommend this movie 100% to horror fans.

I do think the ending of the film could have been trimmed down a bit. The pacing felt a bit off. In my opinion the climax of the film was [the birth scene](#spoiler) and the tension never rose back up to that level again for the rest of the movie. Also I think [John Krasinski's character's sacrifice](#spoiler) could have been a much more powerful scene if [his son wasn't there and he had sacrificed himself just for the girl.

This movie had a lot of great emotional moments and one epic, goosebumps-inducing moment of frisson for me [when the fireworks go off and she lets out a scream](#spoiler). Those moments are rare for this genre. The music was excellent. The film score was subtle but added a lot of tension. And if you're only going to put one actual song in your movie, you can't go wrong with Neil Young. John Krasinski's directing was great.

When it comes to character building via interaction, dialogue is key. Hence why the movie really suffers in this area.  In terms of arcs, I suppose the dad yelling the father telling the deaf duaghter he loves her right before his death is.. one. Although we learned earlier in the scene with the waterfall that he still loves her spite what happened to the one son who really liked space. 

The visuals were nice. I enjoyed just about every shot there was, the scene with the fireworks was cool, and tense. The monster super hearing spider monkey things were cool.

When I'm writing (I'm a Junior in Highschool, hoping to go to filmschool after my senior year) I like to use the though process I called *Justify it* where if something isn't justified, it needs to be.
Why was the basement flooding? That needs to be justified. Why was the mom pregnant? Why would you have unprotected sex in a time like this? What the hell are these things, where did they come from? This could easily be *justified* with something like a mutation or a science experiment gone wrong, or a disease, or a rare species that lived underground for an incredibly long time, hence their lack of vision. (That and I didn't see any eyes on the damn things) 

Where the hell are other people? We saw two other human beings outside of the main family, one dead. By the way, when that guy screams, I can imagine that screaming keemstar meme playing instead of his scream. It was funny, speaking of funny, when John Krasinski (Dad in the movie, and it's director) screamed at the thing, his voice cracked. Anyways, are you really going to tell me that these things whipped out MOST OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION when there's not many around, I mean.. It could be *justified* if it was like 2026-2027 but it wasn't. It was 2020. Yes, I'm sure there's more of them around but there should've been more in the area we saw, that would've made the idea of must of humanity being whipped out more believable. 

I did like the idea of their weakness being high frequency sounds, it made me walk away with the philosophical idea of ""What is your ally is also your enemy"" - you know? 

The only reason I saw A Quiet Place was because I was curious. It does a fantastic job of making me intrigued. In fact it does such a good job of it, I'm still intrigued. We have no explanation. This would be semi-defensible but in the basement where the dad is researching them, we're clearly shown whiteboards with traits of the monsters. This created the idea that we're going to find out more about them. 

Also, what a lazy ending. The mom just chambering a round in the  gun, (Speaking of, why the hell didn't they have more guns? In a situation like this, I'd try to arm myself to the teeth. what, are you going to kill them all? Are you kidding me? Those things are so f--king fast and will tear you to shreds, and you just made a SUPER loud sound.

Acting - Good, infact, I'd say great. 

Visuals - Good, angles, lighting, etc. 

Concept - Good, interesting.

Plot - Stupid, anti-climactic. 

Justification - You can guess my opinion on this.

Just my opinions though, I'm more than willing to talk about it with anyone.  :-)

SCORE - 5.5/10

There are SO MANY things wrong with this movie that I could no longer suspend my disbelief. It reminded me of that movie called Hidden which took a turn for the worse the same way this did: some illogical bs to drive the weak plot forward. I even have my opinions on the type of people that enjoyed this movie. Paid for it to the point that they plan on making a sequel. I'll keep those opinions to myself. Anyone that likes a higher degree of logic in their scripts, pass on this drivel. Seriously, don't drive yourself mad watching and supporting trash like this. One of the newspapers in the movie even had a headline that read, ""Highrise Buildings Loose Elevators and Running Water.""

Here's a few comments about it.

Just live near the river

How didn't the boy understand the concept of sound until John explained it to him

Why had he never been to the waterfall

How did the dead kid not understand that sound is bad

Why didn't they drown in the corn when the monster was standing on them

WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A KID?!?!?!?

Bringing a baby into this post-apocalyptic world is incredibly selfish and stupid

Why didn't they just live in that underground bunker

Why would you let your daughter just roam around outside? There are monsters out there!

dx6w9qb,"I must be in the minority here, but there were just too many plot holes for me to enjoy this movie. What illness did Marcus have in the beginning? I'm assuming this was only relevant because Lee wasn't able to carry Beau. Did anyone else notice Lee seemed to be running forever when Beau turned on the rocket? Wasn't Beau literally right behind them? Why live in a super quiet field when you could live closer to the waterfall? Or live underground? What caused the flood in the barn? They showed a sink overflowing, but who turned it on? Why did Regan turn off her hearing aid when she clearly knew it messed with the creatures? Why did they decide to have another freaking kid?

1)  Someone fix that goddamn nail!  Ugh, it was like a hangnail to me and made me cringe every time people walked down those stairs.  Just give me one 10 second scene showing that thing was bent over or something.  God!

2) It seemed so odd that the first place they went to was a pharmacy.  I dunno, maybe pick up some birth control while you are there??  Just a thought, you know with the whole apocalypse going on.  Seriously though, I know they had a good reason to have another baby after losing their child, so just give me another 10 second scene or comment about why they brought another child into the world.  I mean, how hard would having a baby be in that world?!

3) give me 2 more minutes at the end.  Even just an aerial shot of the women taking those things out.  Clear the area, then end the movie.  Ending seemed slightly premature.

Not huge issues, but it is what gnawed at me after an otherwise awesome movie.",8a5qdo
dx0bq8j,"Can anyone explain to me how they make fires every night without noise like fires make a ton of loud cracking and popping. How there were still animals alive after more than a year like that raccoon would have been dead a long time ago. How they have power and the best they could do with it was lights and old ass tv's, like set up some wifi and some Bluetooth speakers or something, and in what world a nail would ever get pulled up like that.

dx9bx3o,"While I loved the movie, my biggest issue with it is, how in the world did the parents think it was a good idea to not use protection while having sex, they were in a pharmacy in the beginning of the movie so I know they must of had access to condoms. Completely irresponsible on their part to willingly bring another life into that kind of world and to risk the lives of the kids they still have left. 

My other minor grip is the beginning of the scene with the kid and the rocket ship, did the father really think he could leave not only the rocket behind but the batteries as well and trust his four year old not to go back and grab it? And the daughters dumb self as well, if you’re going to give him the toy make sure the batteries aren’t in plain sight. They were all at fault.",8a5qdo

So I think the line that everyone forgot that is really relevant is ""Small sounds are safe. Unless....there is a louder sound nearby."" So all the small stuff they were doing through the first half that were safe was suddenly not okay because the creatures had been drawn there by a louder sound.

How did they film the silo scene? 

The thing that annoyed me is why didn't they have a door? I mean putting a door on would be loud and thus impossible but they should've lived in a place with a door.

Also, what was the fire thing? I didn't understand that. Was it just a signal?",8a5qdo

dwwgkn5,"The world-building was incredible. 

Starting on day 89 was *perfect*. If these things kill that swiftly and relentlessly, they would kill lots of people very quickly, since in any type of apocalyptic scenario, people gather in groups. 

Yes, I'm sure many people figured out how to combat them with noise, but that would take time -- and once they did, how would they practically spread that news, especially in rural areas? 

If the creatures were spread out in proportion to the population (and I agree that it was an invasion, so that type of planning would make sense), they could take out major cities very carefully. So even if you knew what to do, you can't use radio or TV to spread that info, and there isn't the infrastructure to get on a plane and drop notes everywhere a la Dunkirk, and even if there was... it could take months to even come close to a rural farmland. These type of consistencies are *not* the point in a movie like this, but it's awesome that it works so well.

 incredibly Spirit crushing at times, and it sinks its claws into your guts and never lets go. This just ticks all of the boxes I wanted in a horror movie, let alone any movie.

 Being involved in the deaf community this movie tackles something I've always had a problem with in thriller movies. That being the use of sound as a crutch.

 I've had the debate and discussion with deaf friends about how music and sound are what cause that jump, or jolt of fear. Ive always wondered what a silent thriller would be like.

Front door, bedroom doors, basement doors.. etc. Why not live next to the water fall or river? And yes, it would be easy to fight the creatures once you know they are sound based.

I'm not bothered by their choice to get pregnant-I felt like the couple was trying to have another kid to help with their grief over losing the first one.

But why did the father decide that the kids needed to leave the path and go hide under the truck? If he sensed an alien was waiting, just move really freaking quietly, like they did in the rest of the movie.

Also, is everyone else in the world dead? We see the father going through a list of countries he's tried to contact on shortwave radio, and crossing them off a list. He's up to India. Assuming they're in alphabetical order, that means he's already tried Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece... no one in any of these countries is alive and has access to a short-wave radio?

I get that they left the windows and doors open because the sound of opening/shutting them might attract the aliens. The dead leaves everywhere were a nice touch. What happened when it rained? Snowed? I get that they lived in the basement, but weather is going to flood the house and the water would eventually trickle to the basement. It would also warp the front stairs and floors on the surface level and cause unpredictable creaking.

I realize I'm nitpicking here, but the film really had a way of focusing your attention and you notice things that might slip past you in a faster, noisier film. And since the plot is very tightly focused, small details matter more.

What drew the creatures in at the end? Couldn’t have been the gun shot because the fireworks didn’t attract them. I doubt it was the amplified hearing aid since that drove them away earlier. If it was the death of creature how would they know and why would they care? They all seemed pretty solitary and independent.

I don’t see how setting up speakers wouldn’t work. People say they’d hunt them down and destroy them, but why wouldn’t they be all over the river and water fall trying to “destroy” the source? Hell they could just hang the speakers really high up in the air.",8a5qdo
dy41ysm,"Great concept. Poor execution.

As stated above, the concept for the film I thought was very unique and interesting and the film started off generally well. However, the later 4/5 of the film were poor.

For a universe in which noise attracts these monsters, the family sure love to jump scare each other. I don't know about you, but when someone makes me jump, I scream like a little girl and would be killed instantly.

[The film is also very inconsistent. A small noise at the start of the film does barely anything to attract the beasts but in the later part of the film, it pulls the monsters into the house? Speaking of the earlier noise, some raccoons are instead killed by the monster, but this makes me question how these raccoons lived this long anyway? The animals of this world would surely be unaware that making noise attracts these monsters so would be wiped out right at the start.](#spoiler)

[I fail to believe that no scientists did any sound experiments on the beasts before the majority of the world was wiped out, which is later found out to be the only way of killing the monsters. I mean the monsters seem fairly easy to catch, place some sort of noise emitting device in a cage and you have a new pet.](#spoiler)

After the whole “fuck your hearing aid” scene I really lost interest in the character. In fact I didn’t really feel a connection to any of the characters.

Even if the girl didn't hand the toy back to him, he would have just grabbed it himself.  At what point does it not click in your head that maybe, JUST MAYBE, you should separate the toy and the batteries so he can't turn it on and make a bunch of noise?

There is a reason creatures don't evolve that way. 

  I'm sure it's movie logic , but having my immersion interrupted everytime I see the  creature sort of ruins it for me. 


These are my personal opinion so please feel free to downvotes me for saying I don't particularly  like this movie. ",8a5qdo

dxje2mm,"I had 2 gripes with the movie SPOILERS AHEAD:





1)   It was too intense for too long.  The suspense at the beginning was palpable, but halfway through the movie, suspense went out the window and the action went into overdrive with the characters enduring crisis after crisis, with no time in between to calm down.  There was no illusion of safety, but rather than make me feel uneasy, I just rolled by eyes when another one of the things showed up.  

By the end of the movie, I had just gotten accustomed to the crises, and they no longer held any power, although, this is common in suspenseful/horror films.    

2)  (My biggest complaint) The idea that no one had thought to use sound to incapacitate the blind creatures with hypersensitive ears is kind of silly.  [Sonic Weapons are already a thing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_weapon)  They're used as a form of riot control, and they're enough to rupture human ear drums.  They would certainly be effective against the monsters.  

But, that's the case with most movies like this, so I suspended my disbelief.  

Overall, it was a solid movie.    8/10",8a5qdo
dxgsypl,"A few gripes I have with this movie, maybe people can help cool my jets.

[1. So the *real* way to defeat these monsters is as easy as a shotgun blast to the face? Seems pretty ridiculous that no military on the planet could figure out that these blind monsters just sprint over to the nearest loud noise, open up their faces and are easily murked with a shotgun. Set up a few boomboxes, play some Motley Crue and rocket launch those fucks when they mosey on over.](#spoiler)

[2. Seems equally ridiculous that with all the technology our planet has it wouldn't be a first option to try to nullify these monsters with a wide spectrum of frequencies.](#spoiler)

[3. How brutally irresponsible is it to have a baby in this environment!? You're looting a CVS for antibiotics or whatever and you can't grab a couple boxes of Trojans?](#spoiler) 

[4. Is the father trying to cure deafness? I didn't understand this at all. A hearing aide wouldn't work because she's completely deaf right? maybe I'm just ignorant of this but seemed like a huge waste of time given the circumstances.  Maybe focus on building the motley crue boom box system and locating some shotguns.](#spoiler)

[5. When the father finally sacrficies himself to save his kids.... did he really have to scream!? Just throw the damn axe against the shed. It'll make a big ol' noise and that dumbass blind monster will just scramble over there. *WTF* ...then roll your ass down the hill with the kids.](#spoiler)

[6. Why not live in like a concrete building??? You really have to live in the creakiest old, wooden house on the planet? Seems like you should just build a structure by the waterfall at the very least, since you can scream and talk your ass off right next to it with no repercussions.](#spoiler)

All in all I thought there were a ton of plot holes and I was underwhelmed considering all the praise it has gotten.

Also the ending was trash",8a5qdo
dx1pxsm,"I was thinking the same thing about the daughter who was so ignorant of everyone elses lives over grief. I mean she fell asleep in a cornfield alone and at night she was laying down next to the younger siblings memorial at night in the middle of a bridge. she was deaf too with a bad hearing aid which means  even if she made no noise the creatures could randomly stumble across her without her hearing them and kil her like they almost did in the cornfield later in the movie.

And the father sacrificing himself was such a copout ,  why didnt the writers have him throw something or toss a firework like his son did to distract the creatures.  What's even more moronic is the fact that he didn't even try to defend himself as the creature charged him. he had a pickaxe and at least could have tried. 

The most glaring plot point  Is the way the creatures weaknesses were figured out so you could kill them.  That it took a deaf girl with a bad hearing aid to figure out that amplifying  the hearing aids feedback would cause these creatures terrible pain making them vulnerable to a gunshot.  So you're telling me with all the brilliant minds in the world and the military that somebody wouldnt have figured that out ?. Rubbish.

Not bad, almost - good, and the tension is in your head a lot with the simple use of silence but there's so many plot holes and obvious things to question:

[I questioned why they would even think of having more kids, why they NEVER decided to have shit to throw (like glass bottles or jars) to distract the monster, using the hearing aid to fight off that last part instead of sacrificing the dad, and most of all that terrible ending - that shotgun pump and sudden burst of badass-ness just did not belong there IMO.

Oh yeah, also just letting your kids walk behind you. Even before it happened I was like wtf, the order it should be is as the movie shows BUT have the mom or dad be in the back, sandwich formation. 

This movie is basically a metaphor for terrible parenting. Monsters that will kill at the height of sound? Let's have a loud ass baby anyways. Kid who nearly fcked the whole family with a little toy?

dwygyjw,"I seem to be in the minority, but this film really didn't work for me for several reasons. I wanted to like it, and I've been excited to see it for weeks, but the actual product was dissatisfying. 

John krasinski and Emily Blunt both deliver sufficient and sometimes great performances; unfortunately, the same can not be said for the child actors. They were consistently unbelievable, and within the first scene I had already predicted  that they would be unconvincing and awful for the rest of the movie. The son is not nearly as terrible as the daughter, but both are consistently inconsistent and can be visibly seen to be smiling in scenarios that clearly are intended to be scary. 

I also had trouble empathising with the characters because in many scenarios their actions were unbelievable and made little sense. 

I'm commenting this fairly late so I'll leave this post unfinished, but if anyone reads this and actually wants to hear more/discuss points I had issues with, feel free to respond to this and I'll flesh out my opinions further.

dwynu58,"This was a great movie, the sounds were crazy good, the tension was awesome and left the whole theater being scared and quiet and most of the characters were great!
Honestly though, there was basically a second antagonist to the point that if you had to make a synopsis for the movie it could be summarized as: ""The daughter fucks everything up""

She did like 5 major screw ups in the movie and never changed her ways, only got worse by the end.

1. Killed her little brother (The father said he doesn't blame her, but it is actually entirely her fault)
2. Knocked over a lantern which left that monster near their farm (it was shown for that whole time basically, it was that same monster from way back then that was around the farm)
3. Left her pregnant mom and then *went to sleep at the brother's grave wtf*
4. Caused a huge dangerous situation at the corn silo thing over a hatred of her dad that has no basis (He hates you, but he keeps making hearing aids and telling you he'll keep trying, and that he needs you to keep his wife safe, one of the most important people to him). Also... if he's coming for the brother, you're still right beside the brother.

5. Kills her dad. Straight up, she turns off the earpiece even though that was the 3rd time a Monster + ear ringing = runs away

She was ridiculous and a lot of us coming out of the theatre were talking about how horrible that kid was",8a5qdo

dxncutg,"I thought that it was a solid movie, not incredible or anything like that, but by no means bad. It's a good, functional piece that left me walking out of the cinema knowing that I enjoyed myself. That it's receiving such rave reviews is really more a reflection of the sad state of hollywood and movie critics than it is of the film itself.

I would say that the degree of thought that goes into the film's set and how the family adapts to living with as little sound as possible is worthy of praise, not many shows these days pay anywhere near as much attention to detail. Also the suspense of the film (for me personally) is enough that I am willing to overlook the rather glaring use of conventional tropes and plot holes. Interesting concept in general though, part of me wishes those creatures would show up and eat my neighbours who just won't shut up.

I was personally really annoyed by the little girl, she was just way too angsty teenager for me.

I also felt that they should have gone all the way and removed the soundtrack completely to commit to the theme of the film, it might have helped raise the tension further. I won't call it a horror movie either, suspense sure but it's no more frightening than say...Jurassic Park. Also, it doesn't help that the creatures look so similar to [the demogorgon from stranger things or the cloverfield monster](#spoiler)

dxe2uq6,"I've given this movie some more thought since my last post here, and I think I figured out a way to help explain why these monsters have been so successful in wiping out civilization and to help look at the movie in a different light:




I believe the monsters are possibly not reacting directly to sound.  They are telepathic, and react to a living being's *perception* of sound, including intensity/duration and direction.  Their telepathy works through electromagnetism (like an MRI scan), which is why their presence disrupts electronic equipment such as the hearing aid or the lab equipment in the final scene.  The way to kill them (other than a shotgun blast to the face) is to telepathically send their probing frequencies back to them in a feedback loop.  The hearing aid picks these up and are perceived by the deaf girl, which is then perceived by the monster telepathically.  I've only seen the movie once, but I don't think that at any point the deaf girl is alone when a different sound happens and a monster reacts, which helps with this theory.  The egg timer and fireworks scenes work because people are also hearing these sounds and they are off in the distance, which the monsters read telepathically and use to navigate towards the source of the sound.  The raccoons also provide this information telepathically with their squeaks.  Yes.  In the waterfall scene, the background noise is also being perceived by people, which disorients any tracking the monsters do.




This doesn't explain away all the problems in the movie, and might raise some new ones, but it could help explain why they are successful.  Humanity would definitely have a harder time coming up with a solution to monster that works this way I think.",8a5qdo

I mean even the creatures were very clicker\-esque, and John's death scene felt very TLoU\-esque. Speaking of the death scene, I barely cry in movies, but seriously that scene was beautiful and made me tear up. I feel like a single tear may have escaped.

The cinematography was beautiful and provided so much information about the world. The acting was some of the best I have seen, and the child actors were way above my expectations. The dialogue and sound, or lack thereof, made the entire experience unique to anything else I've watched. John's direction and use of silence to create the tension was something I've seen rarely in recent movies, and it was truly a breath of fresh air. The actual creatures design was better than anything I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised with how it set the mood within the first five minutes with the child's death.

The movie has succeeded in deliver high tension to the audience where minor mistake could instantly kill the characters and keep them always on the edge, and do make you question how could humanity really survive it, and what does survival really cost us. 

However, I do also take some issues with the movie. The 3rd act of the movie, after [Emily's Delivery and the reveal of the Aliens](#spoiler), except more direct confrontation, there isn't too much going on really. It feels like the staff had running out of ideas at that point so they chose to introduce more jumpscares other than psychological ones just to keep the movie going. Also the movie becomes a little too pretentious at the very end[so now they are just going to keep shooting the aliens one by one?](#spoiler), almost comical, the tone shifting is quite inconsistent to say the least, undermined the tension/hopelessness that it tries to set up in the first 2 acts.

If you didn't see the big spoilers word at the top you have been warned.

I like to watch movies like this without knowing anything about them before going in. So I didn't watch the trailer and I didn't read up on it. I went into this solely because of the very high Rotten Tomatoes rating.

I will start this off by staying straight up this movie is a 2 out of 10 at best. That too comes from my love for Jim and admittedly the acting is okay.

I can't say a single other positive thing about this movie.

The whole premise itself doesn't make sense. It gives you the days so you know it's about a year-and-a-half into this crisis. I suppose that means we are supposed to believe that the u.s. government and the United Nations tried everything and failed.

So you're telling me that dealing with the creature that hunts by sound not a single scientist in the entire world thought of using drones carrying speakers or better yet just lure these creatures impact and then bomb them?

Let's say that because of the word we see on one of the papers that they really are indestructible until this frequency hits their ears which is the worst climax I've ever seen:

If so you're telling me again that not a single scientist in the world figure it out that because these things hear so well you can just overload their eardrums with high-pitch frequencies that the human ear can't pick up?!

I feel like this movie ripped off signs, The Last of Us, and until dawn and they did a poor job.

dwy5rcl,"I enjoyed the first half of the movie. It's beautifully shot (though there about 3 times as many close ups of dirty bare feet than there needs to be), and the cinematography carries a lot of the exposition. Each shot gives you a sense of the world with very little need for dialogue. The premise was intriguing, and makes for a very interesting first quarter of the movie. 

The plot quickly begins to unravel when one starts to realize that it's driven by the character's lack of common sense.  After the opening scene, they audience comes to realize that sound attracts the aliens/monsters/bugs (what they are and where they came from is never touched upon). The story jumps forward a year or so between scenes. The family is now on a nearby farm. They've made a sound proof bunker, and have developed a sophisticated warning system with lights and fire. In spite of all there caution and preparation, we find the wife/mom character pregnant. From that moment on, it becomes clear that the writers are unable to move the story forward without making the characters conviently stupid. The plot only happens because none of the characters have an ounce of common sense. Conflict is shoved into the movie haphazardly instead of unfolding naturally. It was hard to suspend my disbelief which kept taking me out of the movie. 

The suspense and tension are masterfully built, but the conflict ultimately goes nowhere. The movie ends before the plot is meaningfully resolved. We reach the climax, and then the credits roll. The ending is not a cliffhanger. It doesn't leave you wanting more. It makes you feel betrayed. I left the theater feeling like I had paid $10 to watch an unfinished movie. Did they run out of money half way through, and decide to stich what they had into a movie? That's the impression I get.

If you go in with low expectations, you might enjoy it. I went in knowing nothing about the film, but was still disappointed.

They started getting busy like, right after their kid died. Seemed too quick for her to get pregnant.

Also.. why not turn a radio on full blast, grab a few assault rifles, and just kill those three bastards? The super loud noise would keep the monsters from being able to pinpoint their individual location..

- Why didn't the mom check out the stairs after her laundry bag got snagged? She had time. Yeah, yeah, plot device, whatever.

- Why did the boy run into the corn after setting the fireworks? That would surely make a ton of noise.

**- Why did the dad throw down the ax before sacrificing himself? Could've at least *tried* to take down or injure the monster.**

But I wish they had kind of played up the daughter’s disadvantage more. They use of the score felt pretty misguided too. 

There’s definitely a lot of plot contrivances. I think it’s a little misguided how many people on here like to dismiss people who share their complaints about the movie. I think there was a lot more that could’ve been down with the movie. I was more unnerved by the suffocating thought of living a life as devoid of noise as possible than I was by the thought that these aliens might jump out and insta-kill someone. So I think I would’ve enjoyed the film more if it was more about long term survival, then one scary day.

Still it was better than most horror films, but I still think that’s a low bar. I enjoyed the cast though. This film could’ve really been a drag with less capable actors—the adults and kids alike.",8a5qdo

It really infuriated me, because this could have been one of my all-time favourite Horror movies if done correctly. Unfortunately, characters were making dumb choices that even under my suspension of disbelief was crossing the line. The logic behind what the monsters can and can't hear constantly changes, which is a sign of bad writing as the movie breaks its own rules to make sure certain events happen illogically. The acting and technical side of things were pretty good, as well as the monster design, but I was left very disappointed by the movie.

A monster.

Who likes quiet and can swim.

Sound familiar? 

It should because this bad boi is just the descendent of the Amphibian Man from “The Shape of Water!

That’s right boys and girls, you read that correctly. The monster from “A Quiet Place” is the lovechild of the monster from “The Shape of Water!”

Think about it: at the end of TSOW the amphibian and Elise swim off to live together forever in the sea and PRESUMABLY to pork. After all that porking, I’m sure offspring would be producing. 

Because Elise can’t hear, the monsters from AQP picked up this evolutionary trait, but when mixed with the amphibian man’s DNA caused it to mutate and get worse. Making it to were noise causes it great pain. 

We can see that the creatures from AQP also have human parts, This is because it is half human/amphibian monster! 

Feel free to add any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, but I’m pretty my theory is correct! 

TLDR: There is no possible way that the monsters from “A Quiet Place” aren’t the descendants of Elise and the amphibian man from “The Shape of Water” ",8a5qdo

[Emily killing the alien in the ending sequence completely kills of the movie premise. How she managed to kill the alien with a shotgun on the mouth while the military with far superior weaponry couldn't? I'm pretty sure soldiers can aim better than her. The only explanation i could think off is that the aliens produce a eletromagnetic field which protects them from Kinetic damage (like Godzilla), the same way they generate an EMP to turn off lights off when alerted.](#spoiler)

[I'm pretty sure that if the Aliens weakness was just sound, the military fould have figured it out. But i can understand, humans are used to kill things with weapons that work on us and other earth creatures, when something that doesn't make sense shows up and breaks our reality viewing, we get desesperated and don't think anymore.

As I said to my friends who were asking how the film is after I saw it ahead of everyone else; the film has a concept, and the execution of that concept **does not hold back**. It's set ups are delivered in its entirety and there is no real point (Aside from the end slightly imo) where you'd think ""they could've done so much more with this"". There's only a few small things introduced in the film that I felt weren't used to their full potential, but I won't spoil it for others. Pacing as well suffered a bit, there were some odd and abrupt changes in tone that didn't feel consistent with the next scene. 

My main problem was that I felt the more and more the film goes on the less and less scared you are by the monster. It's not a huge loss of tension, as they are terrifyingly invulnerable, but it's more that the less you would've seen the monster the more frightened you would be maintained.

Also, my friend who watched movie said that John Krasinski doesn't do shit in this movie. To a certain degree that is true, and to a certain degree she did ruin that part of the movie for me, but still I would 100% applaud his first ever directorial efforts. I've heard one person say that this, Don't Breathe and Get Out (as well as probably others) are part of a new horror-renaissance where horror films have a much deeper thematic socio-political backdrop to them and aren't wholly just cheap scares. Not too sure how true that is, but this definitely by itself is a film with more depth in its execution than most.",8a5qdo

It probably doesn't help that I'm on day 3 of my period, but I just thought it was genius how you can't move, can't breathe during the entire movie, but then right at the end it's like that little bit of laughter helped give my body permission to actually FEEL all those horrible things that had happened through the whole movie. I was finally able to let it out. Just thought the whole movie was super well done! Btw I'm ok now in case you were wondering",8a5qdo

dwyb9dk,"Between *Blockers* and this it's a good week for wide releases.  I really liked this movie, and I had a pretty good audience for it.  I heard a lot of groans at the ending, so I'm hoping word of mouth on this is good.

What I liked: All the performances are really good, as is the world-building.  And what makes both of those more impressive is that they were done mostly without words.  Child actors can be hit or miss, but the two kids were great.  Like I said above, my theater mostly didn't like the ending, but I thought it was satisfying, seeing them do the same thing to two more of the monsters wouldn't really improve the movie in any way.  I also thought the PG-13 rating was good for the movie, as goring up the death scenes wouldn't have really added anything.

What I didn't like: I wasn't a huge fan of the way the first scene was structured. I wish it had been presented as more of an accident and less of that kid being really dumb.  I know I'm being kind of hard on a fictional 5 year old, but the characters were so smart before and after that one decision that it broke my immersion a bit.  (Side note- my theater had two walkouts- a couple, I would guess in their mid 30s, who walked out right after this scene).  There were a couple other plot devices that I didn't really buy either (the nail, some stuff with the baby) but it mostly held up.

Overall I give it 4/5.  I'm looking forward to whatever John Krasinski does next.  And I think this is definitely worth seeing in a theater, the big screen experience adds a lot to this.",8a5qdo

Like [when the creature goes to the house after the baby is born, trashes the place, and deliberately? accidentally? causes the flood, I don't understand how it didn't just tear through the floor because the baby was still making noise. It had no problem breaking through that silo. Then, when she finally wakes up to a flooded basement and sees a creature in there, she makes it to her baby, but the baby is still making noise before she picks him up. Up until that point, they were absolutely ruthless attacking sound, even killed the first guy after he stopped screaming.](#spoiler)",8a5qdo

dwyki45,"I thought it was really good and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The audience at my theater was great and people were on edge the whole time. Easily one of the best horror movies I’ve seen in a long time.

The only thing for me is when I think of the logistics and “what if this happened in real life” it begins to fall apart a bit. The more I think about it the less realistic the situation seems (in terms of if this actually happened, not that there are aliens). Like why wouldn’t you have some sort of loud distraction on your person at all times? How do they have electricity? How has the army and the combined intelligence of the worlds scientist not figured out how to defeat the monster 400+ days after their arrival? Literally just blast loud music in the middle of a desert and nuke the fuckers. We have high pitched loud af sonar guns for crowd dispersal, how have they not been pushed back? There was a lot of inconsistency with how sound attracts the monsters and I don’t understand how a picture frame falling in a house can be heard from miles away but they can’t hear a heartbeat from 2 feet away? Why not build your home by the waterfall? In what world is it possible to farm that much corn on your own? Why is it that the monster is shown to have incredible strength and rip through metal all movie only to not be able to break into a car? It really just goes on and on.

dxb9twb,"I cant stop thinking about this film, so I may rant a little bit here so I apologize in advance, but id love to hear your thoughts. There's SO much potential for more stories in this universe, and I would love to see where potential sequels would take us, I almost don't want them to be told because I  don't want this to become the next Cloverfield.  It would be really cool to see more stories told in different forms of media like a graphic novel or maybe short stories on the Blu\-Ray.

From the moment we met the little boy and he talked about the rockets, I had it in my head that that was the where the story was going with John Krasinskis character building a rocket for the family to escape, and when I found out that wasn't the case I was thrown off but in a good way. It totally caught my off guard that the story stayed so grounded. I loved that while we got to see that there are indeed other survivors out there, that we stuck with just this one family's fight for survival .As I was leaving the theater though I couldn't help but think ""What if"". I would love to see a story from another family's perspective during this same time as they try to build a rocket ship to escape. Obviously rockets are EXTREMELY loud so the launch of a rocket wouldn't be an easy task. We also know next to nothing about these creatures besides the newspaper snippets scattered throughout the basement, so it made me wonder, are these creatures immune to fire? We know they came from space so they can obviously breath without oxygen so if they were able to climb on board the ships exterior during launch that could be almost an ""Aliens"" type feel to it. 

I also thought about how they finally discovered the aliens weakness at the end of the film, so it would be interesting to jump ahead maybe 10 years or so as the humans have finally started to develop weapons to fight back against these creatures. And our hero would be John Krasinkis son who had to step up to take care of the family after the ending of the film and hes leading an uprising against the creatures. 10 years in the future \(Story wise, not IRL\) would also give enough time to develop the creatures backstory....were they able to adapt to the high pitched tones. Are they a hive minded colony or are the individual aliens? 

I think what made these creatures so intimidating and frightening is that we know next to nothing about them. We dont know their intentions, the size of the group, the potential of these creatures would be fun to explore as well.",8a5qdo

dww86f7,"I didn’t really like this film, BUT I just want to say that I’m so glad that people are enjoying it and that it’s doing so well critically and commercially. We’re still in pretty dire need of interesting and original horror movies. I love the idea that the film is built on, but I felt the execution was extremely flawed. The characters and Krasinski, as a director, broke too many of the rules that the film (and logic) set for itself for me to really enjoy it, and the last 20 minutes or so, in my opinion, are just awful (the ending being the worst offender).

I will say this, though; when the silence is allowed to simmer, without music, voices, or anything at all and the scares come without any enhancement from added noise/score/etc., it’s really a joy to watch. I also think Krasinski’s thematic intentions are pure; this is a film about parenthood, about protection, about trying to shield your kids from a world that they have to face, though you know they’ll never be ready for it. 

Again, I love what this movie was trying to do; I just don’t think it comes very close to accomplishing its lofty goals. Like I said, though, these are just my opinions; I’m really glad that people are enjoying it so much. My theater tonight was packed.",8a5qdo

Taking away something like noise may seem simple, but the movie does a great job of showing how integral verbal communication is to humans. If the family had the opportunity to discuss what happened at the end of the beginning scene they would not have held onto their intense negative emotions, and likely would have dealt with the impending danger much better. 

Yes we can try and rationalize the other details of the movie but I know I stopped doing that at some point to embrace the unique emotion this movie brings.

dwwi1yz,"Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. Very fresh idea, great execution, this movie was very aesthetically pleasing and it was just the right length. But, it did have it's shortcomings. If it was any longer than 1 hour and 45 minutes I would not have been happy because that is too long to go with out more than 5 instances where there is actual dialogue between characters. For me the ending was extremely corny and kind of dumb. Also, at times I kind of found myself rooting for the monster to kill off the character that was on screen. The theatre I found myself in was very immersed in this film which was a great thing, I actually found myself trying to be as quiet as possible which was really cool because I never get that into movies especially monster movies. If this was intended then great work by those involved in this movie. Unfortunately, I couldn't help but be mad at the characters for being so stupid at times. For example why doesn't every character carry kitchen timers on them in emergency situations to distract the monster away from their location? Half way through the movie and in several moments I could have found this very useful. A few parts that really struck me were when the father sacrificed himself for his stupid kids, when the weakest link got absolutely annihilated on the bridge, and when the trash bandits scared the shit outta the smith family (idk any of the names which is unfortunate). Anyways my least favourite part of this movie was the ending. I just thought it was bad. It's so bad it seems like they phoned it in, to be honest that really upset me. Like it ended so quickly and the climax of the movie wasnt until we were 1 hour and 10 minutes in. All in all I rate this movie 7 emily blunts stomping on a rusty nail out of 10. 

But really it was 7/10 most of the stuff I mentioned is what I really felt about it. 

TLDR; I liked how it wasn't drawn out, the high amounts of tension, the aesthetics of this film were very appealing, and it was an incredibly fresh idea. I really disliked the ending, climax didn't happen until you were deep into the movie, and the characters left alot to be desired. So much so I wanted to see the monsters eat them all minus the baby bc he's innocent.",8a5qdo
dwwiq3b,"This was a fantastic film that was very well made, incredibly dreadful at times. So I objectively would recommend it. 

However with my own personal nitpicking, I HATED the idea that these stumbling, easily manipulated dumbass creatures devastated humanity. I'm sure there is still civilization but my god, there are so many ways to deal with these dumbass monsters. Yes it does say that these monsters are ""Indestructible"" but I find it incredibly hard to believe that they could survive the most powerful explosives, poisons, and projectiles that humanity has come up with.  There is also no way they could survive a nuke, but those arent very practical to use even though I'm sure you could lure them en masse using helicopters. The most obvious thing was that of course harsh sound would hurt a creature that bases its entire existence on sound. Seriously? We never thought to blast high pitch sounds or use sound based weapons or just experiment on them with sound?! Thats the most common sense approach at tackling this monster especially if bullets dont hurt them. At the very least you could easily lure them to specific areas to be dealt with using helicopters with loud speakers. dig a super deep pit and lure them in or at least capture and experiment on them. Digging a pit produces a lot of sound? Clear the area with loud ass helicopters baiting them. I mean it's not like they're superman. The monster was struggling to tear into a simple car (for plot reasons) so it's not like they can lift tons and tons of metal. These are just some ideas from a few minutes of brainstorming from an average guy. Imagine what humans could come up with using the mosy brilliant minds and trillions of dollars. I guess the main issue is that there are just so many of them, probably hundreds of millions of them since the whole world is shut down. So I suppose that's the main counter argument. I don't understand the missing posters though. They're all stacked over each other so it happened over time, and how could so many people disappear from these giant loud monsters without recognizing that there are giant loud monsters killing people?",8a5qdo
dwwjyk6,"Anyone else curious about all the other fires that popped up the first time they lit a fire on top of the silo and then was never addressed or discussed again? Obviously there were other people...

Also where do you find that much sand in the middle of a forest/cornfield?

Also also: love the imagery of the paint to silence footsteps, but why not do a fat line, the younger son wouldn't have had a gait wide enough to get in the house if he needed to. 

Also also also: why use lanterns when you obviously have electricity? It was a cool scene but obviously nonsensical. 

I enjoyed it, but those were my plot holes. ",8a5qdo
dwwqjqb,"Really enjoyed the concept of the movie and was blown away by how they stuck to their guns with the limited dialogue. Ultimately, it's a movie that I admire more than I particularly liked. I didn't really find it scary at all and the daughter was annoying enough to bring the movie down for me.",8a5qdo
dwwr7db,"Great movie. All the performances were excellent, the Super 8 monster and demogorgan’s child was very scary, and the concept was executed almost perfectly.

However, I have a hard time recommending this to be seen in theaters. It was a good lesson in why sound is so important. Every rustle, crinkle, whisper, and cough in the theater sounded like a bomb going off. Some of it is the audience members’ fault, but the ambient noise is just unavoidable and really harmed the experience.

Throughout the beginning of the movie, I could hear faint music and voices faintly off camera, and I was wondering why they would add that. It wasn’t until I could clearly recognize John Boyega’s voice that I realized we were hearing Pacific Rim Uprising in the theater next door! Wonder how many theaters will have that problem or if this one was just poorly sound-proofed.

My question for the movie: What was up with Tuna not letting his daughter enter the basement? Didn’t understand what he was hiding her from. The fact that he cares about her? Also thought it was odd that the family survived for a year and a half and then suddenly couldn’t go 10 minutes without attracting the monsters. And that was the quietest newborn baby with a giant monster smashing stuff all around it ever!",8a5qdo

dwwwt7g,"Loved it. I saw it last night at a 7:00 showing. Phenomenal world building and good acting, and dear god, the directing was amazing. I was tense for over 95% of the movie, to the point where I think it seriously contributed to the terrible headache I currently have.

Only real complaint was how the writers really hammed up Regan and her teen angst. I could’ve done without all the “Dad doesn’t love me” lines. I get they have a contentious relationship, but it could’ve been toned down. That said, her performance was great.

dwxseiy,"This movie was pretty disappointing to me. I thought the whole point of the premise was to be really quiet and tense with spurts of loud, exciting action. Instead the movie was very loud and filled with CONSTANT music. The music really ruined this movie for me. I think I’m in the minority here, but this movie was pretty dumb. Felt like I Am Legend. Not bad, just didn’t meet the potential I felt it had.",8a5qdo
dwxw0ew,"Very effective, very tight 90 minutes of horror. First scene was absolutely brilliant in its execution.

That said—and this is coming from a guy who generally accepts whatever movies throw at him within the confines of the universe they establish—I had real issues with a couple of things:

1) Prior to seeing the movie, I just assumed Emily Blunt's character was pregnant before the creatures arrived. But then we flash forward from 87 days (or whatever it was) to 400+ days. Obviously, she got pregnant in that time. So wait, let me see ---- You're living in what is effectively a post-Apocalyptic world filled with giant monsters that kill anything that makes noise. And you decide that this is a world in which you want to have a baby? Never mind the fact that babies are incessant noisemakers and you're putting the rest of your family at risk by having one around. But who the fuck would willingly bring a child into that world??? How selfish and irresponsible do you have to be to do that? (And yes, I get that the husband and wife were likely overwhelmed with grief in the months following the youngest child's death, and probably not thinking rationally. But c'mon...)

2) So, as evidenced by the newspaper cover, there was a point after the monsters arrived where newspapers were still publishing and being distributed. Surely, there was still some semblance of the military left at that point. You're telling me that the military, which already has high-frequency weapons (assuming that the world in the movie is intended to be OUR world), never put two-and-two together and realized that the monsters who are blind and hunt with sound, might be adversely affected by sound? That's a bit hard to swallow. Frankly, the movie would have been better off without the newspapers and the whiteboard exposition. Let the audience figure this shit out for themselves, goddamit.

Oh, and that final shot. That character might as well have pumped their shotgun, looked at the camera and said ""It's killin' time."" I fucking hated that shot. 

PS: And the farm-to-table food porn was a little over-the-top.",8a5qdo

dwyhwc2,"I definitely enjoyed this movie, but I feel like all of the hype gave me higher expectations than I experienced.  Perhaps they could have fleshed out the universe a little more.  I've always been one of those people that likes the lead-in portion of apocalyptic movies but they didn't do any of that - though the intro they did have was very good.

I guess I just wanted to see what these things did in the lead up to ""89 days later"" or whatever.  I'm just a sucker for that kind of stuff.  

I also think they could have held off on the monster reveal until the end because they were so much more scary when they were a blur of long clawed appendages.  

Still that's pretty much all I could think of that I had any issue with.  It's always great to see an original movie succeed.  I'm pretty sure I'll be watching it again sometime in the future just to try and pick out some details.",8a5qdo
dwyi0tu,"Saw this tonight and absolutely loved it. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.

About the monsters, I think the reason they did not hear heartbeats or breathing sounds is because there's a lot of background noise. This includes the breeze, rustling leaves and all low frequency sounds. But something like a glass shatter or a scream is high-frequency. The monsters are sensitive to high frequency sound [which is why the electronic equipment through them off. It overloaded their senses. Then on the microphone it was high frequency and high amplitude and that was too much.](#spoiler)",8a5qdo
dwyjx2g,"I remember reading a story on Reddit once with a plot similar to this. It may have been a writing prompt, if I remember right. From my memory, it was very similar in that any noise would attract something, but it has been a long time since I read it. Does anyone know what I’m talking about, or am I just crazy?",8a5qdo
dwykedo,"I watch a lot of movies but not in theatres. For some reason, I decided to watch (mainly because I recently found out that Emily Blunt is married to John Krasinkski) and boy am I glad! 

Honestly one of my favorite theatre experiences. The audience were not fully on board with the movie early on - a lot of sighing happened and some people behind me were blaming their friend for choosing this instead of Ready player one. But every time there was a shot of the stairs, we collectively held out breath. 

By the last scene, there were loud cheers and clapping (this is in India so clapping in theatres is nothing new for us!!) And I loved the human element to the story more than anything. 

Also on another note: amidst all these shouts for strong female characters, I think Emily's character is one of the strongest female characters written - the right mix of badass and heart instead of a generic badass. 

Safe to say, l'll be watching anything Krasinkski makes for a long time to come. Hopefully, no sequel though. This ending is too perfect to ruin. ",8a5qdo

[My ending idea: black screen it with a month or so later added to the amount of days. Show the mom and baby in the house acting normal. She's doing things while taking care of the baby. Baby cooing and the mom singing or something in a house that's a bit more normal looking than before. Change to the son running. Only show the feet just running, waist down with sand path not kept up and you hear heavy breathing. He reaches the front door. ""Mom! ...More people are here!"" They start to head out. The mom uses a walkie-talkie and tells the daughter more people are arriving. You hear a response in morse code on the mother's device. Change to the daughter at a hill spot overlooking the farm, she's adjusting her new hearing aid. She goes back swapping out the battery on a device on a poll. As she walks away you hear a piercing sound booting up to a full high pitched squeal. Title screen.](#spoiler)

Novel idea. Novel movie. Novel premise. But I Did not like the movie. I just didn’t take a whole lot away from it. The acting was tremendous and they built up stress very well. The monsters were cool and I liked the brief bits of action vs stress payoff. However:


Tons of plot holes.     


Stupid character decisions.      


And that ending was god awful. I was so ready to walk out content but the final 5 minutes following the sacrifice were just crushing.

FIRST OF ALL, who thinks it is a good idea to let the 4 year old child be the LAST in a line while treking through the wooded trail? That shit would not fly!

Why didn't the family move near a loud naturally occurring feature, like a giant waterfall that the father and son went to? If they can scream and be safe, surely they could build and be pretty safe.

There are tons of natural noises, such as wind, thunder, lightning cracks, rain, rivers/waterfalls, etc. If nature noise is camouflage, which the monsters seem to and realistically must filter out, why not set up a noise making machinery that would make you invisible to the monsters/aliens?

If noise is death, why the fuck haven't they been gathering every acoustic textbook they could find, every piece of foam and noise-cancelling material they could to make a seriously impenetrable shelter? Why not anchor MILES off the coast using a ship in order to not only be safe by distance but also reduce the likelihood the monsters would try to swim that far out? The distance would literally make them non-existent as far as sound pollution/signalling goes.

The papers say the monsters' bodies are impenetrable yet the mother CLEARLY kills one with a simple shotgun shot to the head. You mean to tell me that the military couldn't figure this out? 

Why didn't the military or intelligent people make sound traps for the monsters? Have loud-speakers encased in a VERY thick steel structure (as strong as a bank vault or military tank) and shoot/bomb the monsters as they approached the sound? This round-up method would be extremely simple and effective.

What makes this movie great -- and it's a great genre piece aside from this -- is that it's not about protecting those we love as much as it's about preparing. It's arguable that the *easier* thing, and most protective thing, would be to drug your kids to sleep and surround them with alarm clocks -- let them be eaten in ignorance and thereby never have to live their last moments in horror. 

But these parents believe in something else -- in *preparing* their kids. The movie has no agenda, but making a movie like this about strength in the face of horror -- and that kickass final shot -- is such a noble pursuit. 

*Of course* having sex and risking a baby is an incredible risk. But is choosing for your family to dwindle a better choice? I really think the movie shows us enough of these parents to make me believe that they had a conversation that life was worth living, and worth giving. I think they had sex by the waterfall every day and *wanted* to get pregnant. They knew that giving themselves something to live for was the only way to keep going.

dwz6x91,"This was a really bad movie.

The story made no sense at all. Given that these people had survived for a year and a half, there is no way that they would be making the stupid mistakes that they made. What stupid things, you ask? These stupid things:

* Leaving their small child lagging several yards behind them while on a supply run;
* Getting pregnant during an apocalypse scenario where any noise could kill them;
* Setting up elaborate lighting systems to warn about a problem but not bothering to come up with a door for the basement, because a mattress pulled over the hole is fine;
* Speaking of the lighting system, where are they getting power and water from? They can't be using gas generators to run the lights or a water pump;
* As careful as they are about padding their table so they don't make noise while eating, they don't do the same for their hardwood floors?



In addition, I hate when a movie does not follow its own rules. The monsters seem to change from scene to scene based on how the writer wanted it to play out. For example:  One of the monsters is able to shred a huge hole in the side of the grain silo but later is unable to get inside an old truck. They can hear a glass break inside a house from hundreds of yards away but they can't hear someone breathing right in front of them. The monsters are blind so they must be using some kind of echo location to navigate but they cannot identify a human standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM unless it makes a loud noise.",8a5qdo

* If waterfall sound does not attract the creatures, why won't the character just record the waterfall sound and play it 24/7 around the house?

dxev6ct,"Gotta love reddit downvoting peoples opinions because they don't enjoy a movie!

Pretty much the core of my problems of the movie was about a little girl that just wanted to be a rebel in an apocalyptic world in which every decision she made she made it for herself and didn't give a fuck about her family. A little girl who is secretly on the aliens side, but I am rooting for the aliens as well, just, I'm allowed. I'm an outside party. This girl should want to protect her family. Not be a fucking dick.

The movie was about let's see how many times I (the little girl) could fuck up this shit like I'm making a horror movie for some outside people. She's not acting rationally at all. Every action she does is to make a horror movie. Judging by every persons boner who saw the movie I was expecting a movie. Not some jump scare shit brought on by one individual. The movie could have gone any way. I don't know. Maybe dealing with the other people living in the world like we saw in the fire at night scene. I don't want some stupid walking dead shit, but Krasinski went and chose to make a movie where I can wish from 00:00:01 that the fucking girl dies.

Well also why the fuck would you have a baby when the aliens killing people kill people using sound!?! Number 2, how the fuck can you think it's a safe place to have a fucking baby?! How the fuck can they think they are going to survive with a baby. Why would you do that to a baby? Raising them in a world like that? Please. How the fuck can you think you made a sound proof room and never used it before and go there and think everything is going to be ok. YOU PUT A FUCKING MATTRESS OVER A FUCKING HOLE AND YOU THINK ALL HORRORS CAN'T TOUCH YOU?!

You're fucking telling me that these aliens that find you by sound, no one, and I mean NO ONE used that as an advantage in regards of killing them before? Please tell me. If you are a average person you have sight and sound. IN REALITY TODAY we are creating different forms of weapons that use beams of light and and sound guns to disorient people. Why wouldn't anyone think hey! These aliens hearing sense is jacked up to a million, let's create a device we could wear on our backs that produces amplified sound to fight these fuckers.

That's my short summary.",8a5qdo

dx0rzya,"Is this an unpopular opinion? I recently saw it few days ago and for a horror movie it was purely cheap jump scare. The tension was pretty mild and lackluster as well. It felt like a discount Cloverfield that was appropriating or at least catered to deaf people. 

I'm not going to write an extensive review because that's just not what I do but these are my opinions, I really don't know where the insanely high reviews are coming from. A whole movie composed of dialogue like ""I love you"" ""You gotta protect them"" ""Ahhhhhhhhh"" combined with the lack of plot or backstory really makes for a bad movie. 

All I learned is cochlear implants on a certain frequency can fight these ""monsters"". Also the ending was really cringe worthy....

Someone, anyone would have thought to use sound based weapons see they are effective then relay the message to governments world wide.

dx9uhxk,"A Quiet Place fails to live up to its premise, which is a great premise, but it’s disappointing that nothing in the films gets close to the level of interest or uniqueness of the idea. 

I could tell this was directed by someone with very little experience in directing. Not because it was directed poorly. It just lacks a clear voice and style visually. It’s just kind of a bland lifeless film. It’s also filled with a bunch of ideas that rarely hit and mostly miss. 

The film is comprised of 60 percent set pieces and 40 percent other stuff. That’s not a problem itself, but the problem is that neither are very good. The 40 percent of other stuff is made up of completely one dimensional characters doing nothing that really helps them grow as characters, but rather builds up this world. Which is fine but it leads to characters that don’t really change: the father is protective of his family and stays that way, the mother is concerned and stays that way, the sister is filled with guilt and stays that way, the brother is afraid and stays that way. It also creates a film that feels more like a pilot for a tv show than a movie because it’s mostly set up and world building with no time for characters to grow and develop. This also isn’t inherently a bad thing, having characters like this, but when the set pieces aren’t anything spectacular then it becomes a problem. The other complaint I have is there is no actual plot to the film. Nothing really happens. The plot is so paper thin that you could explain it all in one sentence without missing any detail. Again, on its own, not a bad thing. But when it’s surrounded by flat characters and average set pieces, these things stack up. 

So on to the set pieces. I’m fine having a film that is mostly set pieces, but it really only works if they feel different and have a variety or have multiple different little things happening within. The built in problem with this film is having an enemy that uses only sound to hunt. This leads to every set piece being “stay quiet until a noise distracts the monster” and it becomes predictable and tired. It also isn’t helped by awful noise jump scares. Sudden ramping up of audio to surprise rather than legitimately scare. It got to the point where I was stressed not because what was happening on screen was so harrowing for the characters, but because I was worried when the next loud sound was coming. There is a sequence that features FOUR loud jump scares in under two minutes. 

A few other things bothered me. I found Krasinski to be the worst part of the film from an acting standpoint and design wise. I don’t think Krasinski is a bad actor and I typically like him, but he has nothing to really do because his character is so shallow. As for the design, for whatever reason his costumes looked so pristine and stylish compare to Emily Blunt who spends a lot of the film in overalls. Meanwhile Krasinski looks like an American Eagle model. Minor thing but I noticed it. 

I will give credit where credit is do. I love the concept a lot and lends itself to much more interesting direction than what was delivered. The design elements are also pretty great. The creatures are obviously creative and unique and the set design is really spectacular. It’s also very commendable to commit to no spoken dialogue for about the first 45 minuets. 

The biggest bummer about A Quiet Place is that it really should be the perfect horror film for me conceptually considering what I typically like and don’t like. It’s just so unfortunate that it doesn’t rise past being an interesting idea for me. 

Edit: I’m pretty much on the verge of accepting I’m on crazy pills and there’s something wrong with me. I just feel like this many people can’t be wrong. Still feel the same about the film. Oh well guess I’ll be a martyr. I accept my fate. I’m going down with the ship. ",8a5qdo

dx4olyq,"I was honestly really excited to see this movie last night and after the trailer and all the reviews and amazing scores ... I was totally let down as was pretty much the entire theater. I understand there isn't much dialogue or sound in the movie (so you hear everyone's popcorn munchies). But I did not feel like I was watching a thriller there was no proper setup for any mystery (alien things are just there and react to sound) there was no introduction to the aliens/problem, there were no scary moments I found and I get scared easily... The ending felt rushed and flat. Lastly, the sound proofing attempts were retarded and they didn't even explain how they do many daily activities. Also, why not pitch a fucking tent by the river/waterfall and live there? But then again if these things rush to sound why are they not lurking/congregating by loud natural sounds such as the waterfall? Why didn't the government just drop a bomb in one spot, they all come... and drop a 2nd on their head .... rinse and repeat as necessary... The IDEA of the movie is great but the execution was very poor and the drama/acting did not have the energy of every day survival. Lack of proper music was also at fault to set the mood.... I give it a 6/10",8a5qdo
dxiemh9,"Somewhat enjoyable movie. Acting was fine - the deaf girl was easily the weakest out of the cast. Lots of dumb jump scares. I wish they changed the location up a bit as the movie progressed. They kind of hinted that there were neighbours(?) around but im guessing they all died. I liked how the son was always scared shitless. The dads death was easily the worst part of the movie. It was unnecessary and forced. The reveal of their weakness was so bad as well. Also the whiteboards were dumb as well. Also the reason why she couldnt go into the surveillance room was dumb. Also the dad not hearing the water flooding into the shed was kind of dumb. The car rolling back to their home was funny buy dumb. The kid slamming the car door was dumb too.

Really couldn't fathom the endless stupidity. Literally all they have to do is play some music all the time, hell even a record of thunder/water. They have plenty of gear and aren't poor. This is pretty much the first thing anyone would think of, let alone using sound as a weapon etc.

How were the 'blind' creatures able to navigate, go up down stairs etc?

In over 1 year they never made a mistake or a sound? The monsters conveniently start entering the house (oh so easily, ever heard of barriers?) as soon as the baby is born.

A newborn cries all the time, not when a monster is around the corner and then keeps quiet.

Pretty heroic of the father to sacrifice himself. Good scene. 

edit: I thought the deaf girl was committing suicide because she activated the toy rocket. She wouldn't be able to hear the sounds of the toy but the monsters could. 


One part that had me confused though was what was even the point of the aliens? They didn't appear to be harvesting people or eating them. They were there strictly for murder? I guess it makes them scarier but wish there was more info.

dxa6p9l,"Just came outta the movie. Damn this was pretty good actually.

Although there's DEFINITELY some thoughts I had during this whole thing.

1) That girl was a raging fucking dumbass and a raging fucking moron and a raging fucking CUNT BITCH is what she was.

Yes, I am being 100% and not exaggerating at all. I LOATHED her and hated her guts like no other. 

Here's why:

A] Giving the retarded little kid brother the EXACT thing that just mere SECONDS earlier came within inches of costing ALL of them their lives on not one but TWO occasions. 

You, YOURSELF, LITERALLY saved the kid AND the whole family by catching the damn space shuttle toy when this stupid annoying little kid almost drops it...b/c he's a stupid little kid...obviously.

And yet you GIVE THE MUTHAFUCKING TOY back to him b/c...LOLOLOLOLOL shits and giggles right guys!?!?  

Oh and that's AFTER you SAW that he was stupid enough to put BATTERIES inside of a toy that MAKES NOISE!!!

Oh and you even LEFT the BATTERIES right there in front of him and then TURNED YOUR BACK on him...how could you NOT see the obvious coming?!?!?

Ya you're fucking retard deaf girl.

2) Deaf Daughter is also SELFISH, has a poor temperament, inability to follow simple instructions, lack of respect, lack of a realistic perspective on their situation.

Oh YOU want to go with Big Tuna b/c...reasons right???

Ya well you need to realize that (1): NEVER leave a buddy alone...in this case your 'buddy' is your own damn mother!!! There's a reason why one of the very FIRST things the military teaches you is to NEVER LEAVE SOMEONE ALONE; b/c it leads to DISASTER YOU FUCKING MORON!!!, (2) You can't come b/c the trip is NOT about catching fish so much as it is to teach YOUR BROTHER to be self-sufficient. You need to think ahead to the long-run here you dumb bitch! One day your parents will be dead, and before that they will likely be too old to fend for themselves. Which doesn't matter b/c you WILL eventually have to be able to depend on yourselves and each other. Ya well it's gonna REALLY suck if you had a worthless pussy-ass brother (like you do right now) compared to what if you and your brother could actually fight as one and work together as a team with EQUAL proficiency to one another in terms of survival. Yaaaaaaaa...you should've thought about that before whining about not coming on a fishing trip. (3) Your father tells you what to do. You follow his orders. You obey. Simple as that. Just like how the military maintains a strict adherence to the chain of command; so too should YOU do the same thing. There needs to be some sorta of hierarchy or social structure for decision-making, and everybody arguing about who gets to do what is only going to cause a LOT of trouble. (4) Leaving your mother to go to some damn worthless grave and then spend the rest of the day there SLEEPING was a STUPID idea; no two ways about that. Even if NONE of the rest of the movie happened and it was actually a perfectly damn good day for some strolling and merrymaking out in the woods that STILL would've been a stupid thing to do...b/c your mom is PREGNANT and DUE SOON! For all you know she could've had a particularly bad cramp and fell and needed your help just to get up and move about. Yet, you leave her NOT for a legitimate reason such as gathering supplies or foraging for wild food or whatever...but you go for a PURELY EMOTIONAL reason such as visiting the grave of your brother who's death was totally YOUR FAULT and who's death you should've GOTTEN OVER WITH by then!?!?!? Ridiculous! Worst daughter ever! Oh and you FELL THE FUCK ASLEEP TOO!!! How the FUCK would you know that you might just simply snore or cough or sneeze in your sleep this one time and therefore cause your own death!?!?!?

3) Other son/kid was a pussy...simple as that...ya I hated him too.

4) All the kids sucked in this movie, and they really did suck. This isn't just me saying this b/c I don't like annoying little kids. They really did suck. 

5) OK did not one person in like the entire world really think of using sound AGAINST them?

If they are so sensitive to hearing then it's certainly plausible that they would be sensitive enough that sound may actually DAMAGE them BACK.

Just like how humans are sensitive to light in the form of our eyes; so too should they be sensitive to noise in their ears...which ended up being the case anyways. 

Just like how humans invented things like flashbangs to blind and 'stun' our opponents so too should a 'sound weapon' be able to similarly disorient and hurt them. 

I mean, SURELY, somebody in the entire world would've at least THOUGHT to TEST this simple theory right? 

Apparently not...

...

...

6) The creatures appear to have near worthless intelligence levels.

This is actually quite a significant weakness. 

They could EASILY be fooled/confused with very simple 'tricks' such as setting up contraptions to make noise in a certain location while YOU and YOUR FRIENDS go off in the other direction to get whatever business it is that you need to do be done with. 

It really shouldn't be too hard to do something like tying up tin cans on a string with bouncy objects inside of them and then stringing them up somewhere far away on a windless day then knowing full well that when the wind picks up again those things will distract the muthafucking retards like no other by making them run towards the noisy tin cans. 

This works better once you realize that you can do something like climbing two tall trees together with a buddy on a windless day and then stringing up this VERY simple noise trap together at a height where the creatures can't easily reach it...then watch and laugh as the idiots constantly try and jump up to reach the damn things while wind comes through. 

And this is only a very SIMPLE idea here. 

Not like you couldn't do something like setting up MULTIPLE noise traps to be used in such a way where they make noise one after another so that the creatures keep chasing the phantom noise by running around in circles. 

Even without the use of electronics/electricity as an energy source you should STILL be able to find SOME way where you can setup a noise trap(s) and have that be a distraction while you go about your business for the day. 

7) Speaking of 'noise traps' why not just go full on DEATH traps with noise as the bait. 

We know that they are VERY attracted to noise. 

OK fine!

Setup a noise trap of some kind...or just simply have one brave soul be the bait. 

Make a loud damn noise then (if it's a human being) have the guy displace himself some distance away so that the creatures go to his last known position but not to him directly. 

Ya but too bad there were a buncha guys RIGHT on top of some rocks/trees/whatever nearby who all have things like GUNZZZZZZ or sticks of dynamite or whatever and who were all too ready and HAPPY to UNLOAD on the muthafuckas!!! AHAHAHAHA

Hey I get that they have 'armor' and are 'armored', but we see CLEARLY that the 'armor' is NOT like 100% covering their insides at all times. 

In fact, their 'ears', specifically, actually appear to have to 'open up' in order for them to hear, and it also seems as if they open them up quite frequently. 

Well since that's the case we can simply lure them to that one area with noise and then UNLEASH HELL in the form of SHITLOADS of GUNZZZZ and dynamite going off all over the place. 

Presumably, (applying the 'paint-the-wall' logic here) at least SOME of all those bullets/projectiles/shrapnel/explosive force/whatever will find its mark and get into the 'ears' of the creatures, and thus cause HORRENDOUS damage to them. 

If not killing them outright, then it would certainly render pretty much their ONLY sense RIGHT out the window. 

Even losing ONE 'ear' would likely spell certain doom for them in the long run since now their ability to perceive their surrounds around them is now drastically limited and/or simply distorted. 

Oh and this goes NOTHING to say that one of those bullets or all that explosive force might simply go RIGHT through those nice, big, open, gaping mouths that they like to open up nice and wide with and roar all the time with. 

Something tells me that if a buncha humans gather together and use this 'tactic' that SURELY one of the bullets or other weapons used against them would find its mark when the creatures open up their mouths or ears, and those 2 places are NOT protected by 'armor'. 

They appear to be just as vulnerable as any other sorta living animal flesh on our planet even.

It's really just that 'armor' that's keeping them alive from harm. 

8) What about just simply TRAPPING them inside of sayyyyyy a large metal cage with VERY thick bars, or some other contraption that was designed to withstand tremendous battering and keep something enclosed. 

We do see that the creatures are able to 'tear metal' when they go through the metal door lid thing for the grain silo and how they break the hull of the grain silo itself...however we ALSO see them having difficulty penetrating the 'shell' of a simple pickup truck. 

One that was, quite frankly, neither impressive nor particularly well-maintenanced apparently. 

If that's the case then surely somebody would've thought to themselves:

""Hey! Why don't we put some noisemaker thing like ughhhhhhh A TOY FUCKING ROCKET into a nice big metal cage with  nice big thick bars and then turn it on, but make sure that we have some way of closing the only opening for escape as soon as the damn thing gets in there?""

It's worth a shot. 

If they get trapped inside of some enclosed space then it's really only a matter of time before they starve to death, and if starvation is somehow impossible for them or otherwise unfeasible b/c of the length of time required...well at least you have a live specimen for which to test all sorts of theories work.

1. I thought the wife was deaf and got super confused by that shared iPod scene.  Turns out she isn’t , but there is no indication she can hear earlier (Deafness is hereditary, she doesn’t speak or get spoken to)

4. Breastfeed the stupid baby , that is how you keep them quiet.

A slightly more confident director would have put the characters in more sound based danger. A marble that needed to be caught before rolling off the table and hitting the ground.   A character having to debate between using a loud weapon or letting someone die, etc.

The situation they were living in would have required more structure  to be liveable too.  You would have had to soundproof the entire house in preparation for a baby, and the perimeter of the land they lived on should have had noisemaking devices to use as distractions when curious creatures came around.

Some downsides of the film include the template monsters, a somewhat non-grounded conclusion, and a lack of novelty.

So the premise of the movie is that these creatures are blind but have exceptional hearing. The thing is these things move incredibly fast through all sorts of terrain. HOW????

The first thing that came to mind is that they're like bats and use echolocation, but then the whole premise of being quiet means much less because at that point they can basically see you. There were so many times they were in view of the monsters but weren't ""seen"" so I'm not buying that.

John Krasinski's efforts behind the camera haven't been all that successful, but A Quiet Place finds the funnyman joining the ranks of comedians channeling their understanding of timing and the slow build-up of a good scene. The scares are so well choreographed, with each setpiece finding new and inventive challenges for these characters to dig themselves out of. The film is obviously terrifying, and will have you on the edge of your seat and scared to even breathe too loudly, but Krasinski builds up a quiet intimacy between husband and wife, and father and children. Even without names, and a number of scenes containing spoken dialogue able to be counted on just one hand, these characters are so easy to attach to, and you really care about their survival in this nightmarish scenario. Its a story about family, and what we'll do to protect the ones we love in the greatest of dangers, and Krasinski delivers in highly exciting and emotional ways.

dwyhhwu,"Surprised one of the creatures somehow got into the basement, that made little sense. Water, sure- but the creature??


Also, the creature's design was very interesting- faces that are essentially ears that open up

Now, there's some odd silliness that doesn't made sense- I yell from around a corner, creature comes running - now how does he find me? It seems echolocation- but they need a terminal-phase guidance method to kill...
Echolocation gives you shapes, but to know it's something killable and not a object...hah.

Also, sound bounces....

I feel like a remote controlled speaker system toat makes a loud sound then STOPS- would be perfect to distract them every time. After all, these creatures are out in the woods- directional sound finding? Okay, now miles away, you're not going to have a clue from that sound, what made that sound...(Thinking of this with background knowledge of how modern day submarines operate with their passive sonar arrays...)
Noise cancelling tech would be very interesting to put into play here. 


Kinda interesting they're indestructible in their closed armor- so electricity, microwaves, extreme heat, doesn't kill them? Especially on the electricity bit..Can they drown? They can smash thin silo walls of metal, but how about hard steel? Or titanium? Stone? They can succumb to traps, no? No way to fly, so a deep pit- or a cage of the right material should work...They have to have a nervous system- tasers remote-controlled would be a good test...they have to be susceptible to chemicals of some sort - what do they eat? They should need to sleep...Their reaction time also has limits- cheetah fast? That might not save them from some traps....

Scientists should have a field day on these things,even if they seem ""indestructible."" They're too easy to bait....

High frequency sounds bother them- but high frequency sounds don't go as far as low ones - amazing they can hear a human miles away in a house, through a forest- when the sound takes time to travel, spreads, and diminishes by such a degree-...I guess it makes sense why their heads are so big...to collect sound..
I'd love to know their frequency response. Can they actually hear then go after elephants? How high a frequency can they hear? Do they hear through the ground(sound is faster in solids, but guess what- direction finding organs (or equipment)build for the ground isn't going to work in the air. And if their organs have that sort of dynamic power- how about in water? 


All it takes is a thunderstorm- or a windy day though... Or being near a ocean... /nature's white noise  should drive them insane- and if they're able to zero in on human frequencies- those don't go far. Objects breaking and falling aren't rare in the apocalypse though...
 
The scenes were written to drive things along- but at the end, i didn't understand how they found them again. Heard the tvs from outside the house? Didn't make sense....would have found them before then.. Baby's sounds weren't that loud at that point- so hearing those from that sort of range- I don't think that's possible....Sound gets fully absorbed at a certain point going through the atmosphere.

Overall, my theater was dead quiet.

if a branch falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it , does it make a sound? Yeah, because these things will go there anyway then somehow know the branch was the source, then attack it xD",8a5qdo

3. How did they walk during autumn when everyrhing is full ov leaves?
4. And during winter? Snow? Ice?
5. Why didn't the great electrician figure out to put a speaker a couple of hundred of meters away from home as a decoy when something bad happens?
6. Live by the waterfall maybe?
7. Could they have made a better, more secure underground room?
8. Do they ever talk while sleepeing? Are they sleeping like logs withuit moving?

dwy1xsy,My thoughts exactly! ,8a5qdo
dxzqpin,"The tune of the door creaking and the waiting for the monster in a hostile environment, a ‘sea’ of grain type thing gave me jaws vibes in that scene.  Big tuna said that he pulled inspiration from different classic monster films including jaws and I couldn’t help feeling like this was an extremely subtle nod.

I could just be imagining things though",8a5qdo

dwxt3pr,That shotgun reload.,8a5qdo

Looked like the trash pandas on treasure island in San Francisco haha",8a5qdo

dww35iu,I was telling my gf that my farts after eating Indian food would cause a hardcore frenzy among the monsters. 😑,8a5qdo

dwxa4by,"Agreed. Are they eating the people they kill? My girlfriend thinks they just kill because the noises are irritating or cause them pain so they just want to make them stop. Evidence for this is when the tv static is going one of the creatures smashes the tv.

On the other hand, they have some big old chompers. Would make sense that a creature with teeth like that is hunting for food.",8a5qdo
dwxbfn0,I believe they were aliens. There was a newspaper hung up that said a giant meteor landed in Mexico. I'm guessing they came from that.,8a5qdo
dwwa6la,Angels of death,8a5qdo
dwyf1wm,I feel like the creatures were inspired by the clickers in The Last of Us. Very similar sounds and face. ,8a5qdo
dwy4qwf,"I don’t think they were eating. At least not the humans. The old lady was dead on the ground with a claw wound but did not appear to have any evidence of feeding. 
Aliens will come to make contact or because they need our planet. The fact they came in on a meteor doesn’t necessarily eliminate premeditation. It could be like starship troopers where they “hurl their spore into space to colonize new planets” and upon arriving they need to eliminate indigenous life.",8a5qdo
dx2cgdm,"In the sound room there was a whiteboard with landing times and a note saying there was no pattern. I think a other newspaper mentioned meteorites. I think they fell on meteorites and gradually increased in number as more fell which is why the the chaos came gradually (missing person notices on posts from when there were only a few creatures, printing press still active long enough to report on sound being key and the defeat of the US military, etc.)",8a5qdo
dwxo536,"They zoom in on what looks like a pair of crab claws attached to the mid section of the creature during one of the scenes. Could be relevant as to it's origin. I got major Cloverfield vibes, from the expanding head/ear, the body structure with the giant arms and multiple smaller limbs, the way it walked, the crab claws on it's midsection also suggest a crustacean/sea monster vibe like Clover. The noises were very similar to the Aliens in 10 Cloverfield Lane too. Could easily be slotted into that multiverse.",8a5qdo
dwyc4g3,Nope. Overexplaing woulda slowed it down and ruined it,8a5qdo
dx1v5vv,I like to imagine that the meteor in Mexico (shown in one of the newspaper clippings) awoke the creatures from underground. Which would explain why the had no eyesight and hunted by sound. ,8a5qdo
dxtcul8,I know this reply is late but on the dads whiteboard it said “Why don’t they eat their kill??”,8a5qdo

i wonder this too, because the lady that was attacked seemed to be whole with just  a wound in her side.",8a5qdo
dwzyp48,I think I saw a newspaper that said something about a meteorite so I think that’s where they came from,8a5qdo

dx5q81l,"There was a newspaper headline that said “Alien Invasion,” so it’s possible!",8a5qdo

dy5hxs2,"My theory is that a more intelligent invading species placed the creatures on Earth for a mass extermination. I didn't feel the creatures themselves seemed very intelligent.

Surely the intelligent aliens would know about the high frequency sounds hurting them, so once they were ready to begin terraforming all they had to do was land and get rid of the creatures with the sound.

dwycpqi,"I think he was trying to protect her from the time and effort he put into the hearing aids because she allready felt guilty and like, he wouldnt want her to think shes a drain on his time. Also maybe he knew that if she fiddled with a knob wrong it would make noise and she wouldnt know.",8a5qdo
dwzx5lj,I assumed that her being deaf meant that should couldn't hear when she was making noise and on creaky stairs you have to be able to adapt to the possible noise you would be making.  I thought that was a critical plot point that he was so concerned about building a hearing aid that could work for his daughter because he wanted her to be able to have the assurance that she wasn't making ANY noises when she moved.,8a5qdo
dx3vxbh,"The dad felt weirdly concerned with gender roles for it being the apocalypse. He forbade her from going downstairs when she was clearly smart enough to not mess with anything and technical enough that she could have helped and didn't allow her to go on the fishing/hunting trip when she clearly wanted to go and the boy didn't, instead telling her to help her mom around the house. I wasn't really sure what the deal was with all that.",8a5qdo
dxqgvot,I think it’s because her hearing device would have generated feedback ringing with all those microphone and radios.,8a5qdo
dy985t3,"A bit late but I just saw the movie, my take: the dad feels she didn't understand the impact of sound after their son died because she gave the toy back. The basement contained a washing machine, dryer, radio, etc. 

He was afraid she didn't realize what did and did not make sound.",8a5qdo
dwwl3uw,"I think the daughter never knew there were monsters until the end. She was deaf, she is VERY confused when the monster is attacking them in the truck.

First 20 minutes was nothing but teenagers snickering, wrappers being crinkled, loud popcorn eaters and the occasional loud-talking child (yes, there were young kids with their parents at a horror movie at 9:30 pm). 
 
After the youngest son was killed a large obnoxious group screamed and howled with laughter.  
 It wasn't until the halfway point of the movie that the audience was mostly quiet. Even then there were still occasionally people eating loudly and dropping things.

The only sound added to the overall experience. Maybe 90 minutes in, everyone still dead silent, a cell phone with the default ringtone goes off. [RING]...(silence)...[RING]...*whisper from audience:* ""you're going to get us all killed!"" It was perfect, and the only sound my sold out audience made.

(Or maybe I just got lucky? After the popcorn munching ended fifteen minutes in, the theater was dead silent.)",8a5qdo
dwwkvvi,I got  high school girls kms,8a5qdo
dwy5cnq,"I ALWAYS get popcorn for movies... but I didn't for this one for precisely that reason. Once I saw how quiet it was in just the first few minutes, I was really glad I didn't.",8a5qdo
dwy39x5,"Lucky you! Tonight was my official deciding factor that I am not going to another Friday night showing for a movie I really want to see! Maybe a comedy. 

Two cell phones went off.

Everybody around me had a cough every other minute.

People shoving their hands in the bags. Making all kinds of noise

And moaning baby.

I'm done! I did not pay 13 dollars to hear other people's noise. I feel like a snob but damn. I'm so annoyed.

The movie was great though! ",8a5qdo
dx19mxa,I saw it at Alamo Drafthouse  and they actually had a print out on the table for suggested “crunch-less” snacks and a warning that it was a very quiet movie. ,8a5qdo
dwwfyei,Lucky you! I had snackers all around me. A guy loudly slurping his giant mega soda and shaking the ice in the plastic cup while belching loudly and talking to himself. And a woman repeatedly yelling TURN YOUR THING ON! 😢,8a5qdo
dwyaz6p,"I got stuck in a theater with a bunch of girls that laughed after every scary thing and a fat black woman who said at least 10 ""aw hell naw""s.",8a5qdo
dwyhgcg,I might go watch it again on a matinee or slow weekday. Normally people munching on popcorn and making small sounds is a non-issue but with this one being so quiet it was actually noticeable for me. Would also be a blast in a quiet house with a good sound system. Definitely a zero distractions is best kind of movie.,8a5qdo
dwyjj8x,"I couldnt wash my hair before I went to see it, so I wore a hat, which was a blessing cause I put that hat over my mouth cause I started gasping.",8a5qdo
dwyu95z,I had a baby in mine....,8a5qdo
dwzlk12,"There were two people in the back talking. Only two, the rest of the theater was silent. I turned around and told them “shut the fuck up” and they actually did.",8a5qdo
dwznq30,3 generations of movie talkers sat in my row. They literally got more words in than the people in the movie. Two of the children were too young to read and were constantly asking what the subtitles said.,8a5qdo
dwwhhlp,"I commented on that to my buddies when we left. One squad of 15 year old looking boys were the worst by far and even they only spoke up once or twice and not too loudly. 

Super respectful audience, and we kinda went through the scares together with the knowing chuckles afterwards and all that. A really good cinema experience. ",8a5qdo
dwwhtpf,The lady 2 seats down from me answered a freaking phone call in the last 5 min. I was so pissed. She also didn’t care when I told her to get of the phone and when she was shhhd by everyone around her. ,8a5qdo
dwy1328,The theatre I was in was absolutely silent. I was afraid to chew my popcorn. Also was afraid to breathe.  ,8a5qdo
dwy22te,I have never bought something at a movie theater and didn’t eat any of it because I was so glued to the screen. I didn’t even touch my bunch’a crunch :( I was silent just like they were. It was such a great film. ,8a5qdo
dwy42m7,I thought for sure I was gonna be victim to a talker. This one guy said “oh shit” in a really loud way when they killed the boy on the bridge. Then some girl in the theatre sneezed and the same guy said “god bless you” and they were sitting far apart. I was fuming mad because I was expecting a lot more but thankfully he didn’t make anymore noises.,8a5qdo
dwy4r84,My theater was next to Ready Player One and I was worried at the beginning it would ruin the experience. I could hear dialogue through the walls with how dead quiet this movie was.. I quickly tuned it out though and 15 or so minutes in I forgot all about it.,8a5qdo
dwy9jyh,"The people right in front of me, when the creature was trying to tear through the truck, were screaming, ""Turn it on! Turn it on!"" Annoying as hell, but still not as bad as when I went to see IT.",8a5qdo
dwybde0,"I had a large group of teenage girls in front of me and a guy who thought it was appropriate to girl at inconvenient times to my right. For a movie based around not making a sound, I had the loudest audience",8a5qdo
dwybl4v,"I'm not certain that wasn't people near the front on a cell phone, but I didn't see light from down there, but either way, during my showing, during the silent scenes with absolutely no noise, I could hear people laughing from the front corner of the room. However, that is also next to the emergency exit, which leads straight outside to the front of the theater. So maybe, if the soundproofing isn't good enough, I was hearing people outside after they got out of their movies?",8a5qdo
dwydl2f,It got so quiet I could hear the other movie in the next theater. Kinda ruined it a few times...,8a5qdo
dwye10t,"My theatre was totally packed, crowd was lit during every jump scare laughing or just adding little ""oh hell no"" whenever the creature was creepin, but kept it respectful during quiet or serious moments. Really made the movie, but damn how do ppl stay on their phone for half a movie they PAID for? 

",8a5qdo
dwyhqs9,"I watched it with the worst group of friends. They're usually (somewhat) quiet in other films, but I stg they were trying to make the theater a loud place. And my friend had to audacity to ask me something non-film related during the climax of the film.....",8a5qdo
dwylpqf,"1 The door was open during the first 10 minutes of the movie and there were a bunch of people outside.

2 people kept showing up late and leaving and coming back. Dropping things. Guy actually said sorry too

3 freaking goofie cell phone ring tone went off during a mom and dad moment",8a5qdo
dwyre90,"Lucky you, I bought seats at the last row, little did I know it was directly above air conditioner, and the whole thing was loud as fuck throughout the entire movie, completely ruined the mood :(",8a5qdo
dwysjqa,"I was so mad. Up until the first kid got snatched, there was a group of teens in the back talking and laughing. 

Pretty soon after that, a group of 10 other teens came in (late) to the front row. They actually talked to the characters as stuff happened. One of these gems even yelled at the screen with little quips which I'm sure he thought was hilarious. Plus they were on their phones a lot. Not even sneaky phone looks either. People kept shushing them, but they kept going. ",8a5qdo
dwzfk2r,"Same, we had some loud whisperers at the beginning of the film but once the Woods scene and Emily Blunts water breaking you could hear a pin drop. ",8a5qdo
dwzjlhp,"God damn I'm jealous. One guy kept sniffling and ""ahem""ing. Like, dude, just blow your nose or clear your throat once and be done with it. Don't draw it out for two hours trying to be ""polite.""",8a5qdo
dwzkpes,"I dropped the lid from my pasta salad during the first act, felt so bad, haha",8a5qdo
dwzo6dk,"Unfortunately, I just sat through the entire movie next to someone whose every breath was as loud as a snore. I thought the guy was asleep multiple times throughout the movie but every time I looked over with the corners of my eyes his eyes was open.",8a5qdo
dwzo8mw,Where do y'all go to the movies where your average experience is bad ?,8a5qdo
dwzq5a0,Mine was every quiet part seemed to be the cue to take the noisiest snacks out. And the theatre next door to us must've been some action movie cuz it kinda killed it for us. That was the biggest pain in the ass  but it didn't completely ruin it.,8a5qdo
dwzua6b,"Fuck I wish I had this luck. Had this one lady sitting near me yelling at the end. ""Girl turn the hearing back on, damn!"" was particularly annoying",8a5qdo
dwzuheg,"A chick in my theatre audibly moaned every time a monster was near, or the nail was in sight. How can someone be so fucking oblivious to their actions? It’s called a QUIET PLACE jesus christ",8a5qdo
dwzvsj9,"I got unlucky and was seated next to three teenagers who were the most obnoxious little shits I’ve ever been in a theater with. Snickering, burping, reading the subtitles out loud, you name it, they thought of it. I was wishing those monsters were real cuz they’d be the first to go.",8a5qdo
dwzwquk,"Lucky you. When me and my family were buying tickets i noticed a lot of younger kids buying tickets for the film as well and at that point I knew it would be a nightmare...and it was. Running up and down the stairs, laughing out loud, rustling of food/bags, literal LOUD audible conversations...fuck man couldn’t they just watch ready player one or something!?",8a5qdo
dwzy9yo,"Sounds nice. My theater had one guy who was stomping his feet and saying ""oh no"" in a conversational tone the entire movie. Really took me out of it. My friend went off on him the moment the credits began to roll. ",8a5qdo
dx00thn,"We had a women bring a dog in her purse....It started barking during the opening scene....

You could see everyone look around at her and just think, ""WTF?""",8a5qdo
dx03fn8,Girl in my theatre had hiccups for the first half. Of all the films to get hiccups in.,8a5qdo
dx07utl,Mine was with bunch of fucking shitheaded 12 y/os that I had to shout out “Shut up” a couple of times at.,8a5qdo
dx08uic,"there were a few teenagers in the theater I saw it in (wasn't very full). They were making a bit of noise for a while, once the kid died in the beginning they went pretty much silent for the rest of the film ",8a5qdo
dx0q53v,"I went to a small local theatre instead of the big name cinema chain. Not as cushy, but the place wasn't super full and not a single person wanted to be the one making noise so it was nice and quiet.

Plus, the squeaky chairs in the theatre when anyone adjusted made for some accidental spooks. ",8a5qdo
dx0uatx,"One dude shouted ""OH SHIT"" at the first death. No noise after.

Tbh tho i like a loud crowd. I dont get the hate",8a5qdo
dx0y5ur,"This is a great movie but I’d recommend watching it at home. With it being such a quiet movie, all I could hear was ambient noises of people eating popcorn and even the movie in the neighboring theatre. Very distracting.",8a5qdo
dx10b4x,"Some fucking asshole had their phone go off with the Office theme right at the end, when the girl uses her hearing aid.",8a5qdo
dx12305,"I felt bad because I had a pretty bad cough, but was doing my best to hold it in =( . Fortunately half the theater was also high school kids who had just gotten out of prom but they were actually for the most part surprisingly well behaved, considering the theater was full. ",8a5qdo
dx1p6ge,The first 15-25ish minutes had a lot of crowd noise. Once the little kid went though? We didn't get halfway through our popcorn we were so frozen. It was the quietest movie and the quietest crowd ever.,8a5qdo
dx1qsx0,"In my theater, I felt like I couldn't breathe or everyone would shush me.",8a5qdo
dx1r824,"I got a crying baby. Fuck it was terrible, people are the worst",8a5qdo
dx1y6a5,"There was a lot of noise and shifting about at the beginning, but after the opening scene everyone shut up for the rest of it. ",8a5qdo
dx1zeni,"I had the opposite. Some gross inconsiderate ass spent the whole first half of the movie feasting on an extra large popcorn without once closing their mouth.

CRUNCH-CRUNCH-SLOP-SLOP-SLOP-CRUNCH-CRUNCH-SLOP-SLOP-SLOP

They were almost a full row away, out of sight, but they were eating louder than a hippo. Like holy fuck this is a movie about *silence*. Learn to close your mouth like a real human being.",8a5qdo
dx2117w,Lucky. The couple next to me ordered nachos. FREAKING NACHOS. To a movie called THE QUIET PLACE.,8a5qdo
dx25oq3,"During one of the tensest moments, somebody's cell phone went off. And it was that classic ringtone, too, the one everybody has. I think it was when she was giving birth in the bath tub. 

It sucks to have your cell phone go off in any movie, but especially during the dramatic climax of a film called *A Quiet Place.* ",8a5qdo
dx2i40v,"My theatre was next to a movie playing a loud comedy, I think the most recent Tyler perry movie of blockers.  Really ruined some of the tension ",8a5qdo
dx3h178,guess i got lucky too. theater was noisy af before but not a word during. however we did laugh and clap at the same times too. it was nice.,8a5qdo
dx3oiii,"I had to change seats 10 mins in, this dude nearby  could not stop sliding his hand against the grain of his beard stubble, eck ",8a5qdo
dx3xspw,"I was even luckier and was the only one in my theatre. It's a good thing too, because some of my reactions were quite vocal!",8a5qdo
dx4053p,We had a group talking during the movie but we got them kicked out immediately. Very satisfied seeing them butthurt while being escorted out. ,8a5qdo
dx43ozf,"When Krasinzki grabbed his son from the empty corn field in a dramatic moment, my girlfriend yelled ""SHIT!"" Instead of just allowing the moment to sit and that being a worthy response, she loudly followed with ""sorry!"". 


I don't think we were in the same theater.",8a5qdo
dx6gnql,"If I watch a movie by myself, I always take seats away from others. I swear to god nothing scared me more in this movie than to see a long line of teenage girls come into the theater 30 mins after the movie started and sit in the lane ahead of me. But the movie was so good, they quickly got into the films rhythm and quietened down. ",8a5qdo
dx6mchq,Same. Packed out theater in Friday night and hardly a whisper from what I could tell. I made a comment to my brothers that it was the quietest crowd I'd ever been in. The guy next to me was eating his popcorn but he was doing as well as he could to keep it quiet so it didn't bother me at all.,8a5qdo
dxauej6,"I had a real big pussy sitting behind me and he was very verbal with his fear. 

Every time ANYTHING happened he would have to open his mouth and say something. Kind of a ""talk yourself into a calm"" type deal. 

THAT SHIT DOESN'T FLY IN A THEATER BRO.",8a5qdo
dxbk36i,Just got out and some guy was snoring throughout the first half. ,8a5qdo
dxc6qax,"Oh I sure didn’t. At the very end of the movie, when Emily is gathering the kids in the basement, the teenagers who had been giggling and eating candy and talking loudly the entire movie entertained me with this exchange:

“OOOH, girl! Watch out for that nail; you’re gonna get AIDS!!”

“It’s not AIDS. It’s tetanus...”

“Ohhhhhh....”",8a5qdo
dxc6vjm,I had a group of obnoxious teens in front of me :/ ,8a5qdo
dxfada2,"Same, except when the girl took out her hearing aids in the car. Someone way back in the theater said: ""...retard"".",8a5qdo
dxg2y8x,I was in gold class and the usher came to clean off the food table right at the most dramatic moment :/,8a5qdo
dxhmz7e,"Yeah I bought a popcorn before seeing it today, and after about twenty minutes I just placed it in the empty seat next to me and waited for louder scenes. ",8a5qdo
dxko6ce,"This one group was talking loudly the entire time. I was seconds away from standing up and screaming SHUT THE FUCK UP at the top of my lungs haha.  This just isn't the kind of movie that noisy ass disrespectful people should be allowed into
",8a5qdo
dxl0p6z,"I saw it at Alamo Drafthouse. The theater was packed but insanely quiet, it was eerie. Even us popcorn eaters were very quiet.",8a5qdo
dxra0y3,"I had two insufferable teenagers nearby that talked the entire time. If I had been closer to them, they would have received a very old loud SHHH",8a5qdo
dxsvgx2,Yeah there was only 6 of us in the whole theatre it was great. I had my snacks prepared and opened before the film started cause I knew the stress was to come ,8a5qdo
dxwvpa2,I dont know. I would have loved to watch them all get eaten,8a5qdo
dyo55ws,I caught a matinee where I was the only person in the theater.  It was fucking awesome.  ,8a5qdo
dyzvjxa,I went by myself and I was alone in the theatre with two other dudes. They were talking like it was their living room. I had to shush them and it was awkward.  ,8a5qdo
dwzzrgg,HEY AUDIENCE. IN CASE YOURE FUCKING STUPID AND DIDNT GET IT YET - MONSTERS BLIND. ATTACK SOUND. ,8a5qdo
dx0o0w1,"Idk, I write out the obvious when planning at work all the time. Helps me ",8a5qdo
dwzt6q0,"Literally my only complaint about the movie. It's very minor, but still seemed a bit on the nose. 

Just newspaper clippings would have been much better imo ",8a5qdo
dxf4dpj,It was a plot device to show that hey hadn’t learned anything new about the monster in the like 300 days that had passed from the opening scene I think. ,8a5qdo
dx6bx7k,"One of the scenes near the end has Emily Blunt or the daughter standing in front of the white board, with the board being out of focus— it looked like the writing was completely different. I couldn’t read it all but I could see, “How many?!” Written near the top (while we see “3 confirmed in area” on the board throughout the rest of the film). I’m assuming they added insert shots of a new white board to simplify some of the ground rules of the film. ",8a5qdo
dxlfy6g,"I'm late to this movie, but reminds me of this scene.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQyXsvnAudc",8a5qdo
dyuny4i,They can’t talk...,8a5qdo
e1fkidq,"I've thought about that too but since they really can't talk and need to teach their kids, I guess that's a pretty good idea. Also, it's a usual trope in survival horror films to write down things about the danger for the people who might be new to the place. Sure they'd already know but some things might help",8a5qdo
dwwdsup,That's the first thing I noticed. Nobody dared to grab the Sunchips.,8a5qdo
dwx1ir4,"When the film starts and they’re going through all the papers of what happened, one of them says “meteorite crashes in mexico” which either brought the monsters here or woke them up ",8a5qdo
dwww9ft,See you in r/moviedetails in a few months. ,8a5qdo
dwxhl8x,"this is an example of my favorite aspect of the film in general, which was attention to detail.

laying down sand to walk on, walking around barefoot, chips in the grocery store, using running water to mask noise

they really committed to the ""don't make noise"" angle, and killed it",8a5qdo
dwxzqtb,"Did anyone else buy a shit ton of candy and then feel awkward and meta as you tried to eat it respectfully while watching this quiet ass movie!? 

I have like 3 bags of m&ms leftover and that never happens haha. 

Edit - maybe it was 300 bags of m&ms since I’m apparently a fat ass American because I mentioned eating candy at the movie theatre. 

I also never go to the gym, I have a terrible metabolism, I don’t diet whatsoever, I only go outside to go to the movies, and I take a Segway to the subway even though they are illegal on nyc sidewalks, because walking is too healthy! ",8a5qdo
dwy3ejr,The fact that there was so much going on without the usual neon sign pointing at something with subtitles explaining why there’s a neon sign pointing at this and have them explain it anyway later in the movie was amazing,8a5qdo
dwyo6lu,No dogs too.,8a5qdo
dxdcatm,"Yes! Those small details made it for me. Like when the kids played monopoly, they replaced the metal pieces like the thimble, top hat and car with felt bits and the houses with red cotton balls. Plus I thought it was cool that tuna loaded the gun under a sheet to reduce noise, something he must have practiced over and over for any real emergency. ",8a5qdo
dwye2c4,"I did notice that! Made perfect sense, especially since later on you saw all the canned goods they had in the cellar -- they weren't hungry and desperate enough to risk it. ",8a5qdo
dwym8c6,I was in a packed cinema and in the first 5 minutes all i could hear was people trying to eat their candy / popcorn as quietly as possibly. A wonderful irony of participatory sound design.,8a5qdo
dx0340k,Yeah but at the same time they left pictures up on the walls of their house where they could fall and make a horrible crashing sound? OF the jars on the edge of the shelf?,8a5qdo
dx0rrw3,shit i noticed empty freezers but tons of crisps but didn't make the connection,8a5qdo
dwx0qqj,"As someone who has had to open bag of chips and eat them without someone hearing it, I would've taken them. ",8a5qdo

dwze1z2,"Yea, wish the guy sitting next to me in the cinema had left his bag a chips also.",8a5qdo
dxc7vvg,"There was so much attention to detail in this film. The game pieces they used to play Monopoly were made of felt, so it wouldnt cause noise.",8a5qdo

dy32o8n,"Wow.. I didn't notice that AT ALL.  Wow.  That was amazing now that I think about it.
",8a5qdo
dww396e,I was so scared that there would be a scene where one of the characters would have to cover the babies mouth and would accidentally kill it.,8a5qdo
dww6dja,I saw this film  with my friend whom we both saw ***mother!*** with. She was having traumatic flashbacks to that when she saw the baby near the monster. ,8a5qdo
dww55sw,"That was such a terrific scene, especially with the whole Jaws predator slinking back under water. And then the culminating Alien 3 homage with the Necromorph creature up in Blunt's face. ",8a5qdo
dww5302,Same. I was nervously waiting for the baby to be smothered the entire time.,8a5qdo
dwwd81c,When it goes under the water I was like NOPE!,8a5qdo
dwyjabj,"Honestly, I wish they had gone for it. The ending was too safe. They’d have to save something so shocking for the end of the film though.  The perfect opportunity was the final scene in the basement before they discovered the creature’s weakness. Imagine her having to smother her crying baby to save herself and her two children right after losing her husband. That would have been an ending people would never stop talking about.",8a5qdo
dwxhmo2,"> thought she was going to have to smother it.

there were several scenes where I thought they were going to have to smother or sacrifice the baby. i'm shocked it made it through the film",8a5qdo
dwyiup5,"When I saw the trailer that showed that she was pregnant, I leaned over to my girlfriend and said ""I bet that baby gets MASHed."" I was so certain that that would be the case. When the basement was flooding and the creature was in the corner, I thought the creature got the baby and was eating it, and I thought that that was just super bold.

Of course, it wasn't the case, but those few moments before I knew were real intense. ",8a5qdo
dww86kz,Confused why literally no one put their hand over the babies mouth... Can they not breathe through just their noses at that young of an age?,8a5qdo
dwzvw80,The whole time I thought the oxygen mask and wooden crate was some sort of gas that would quickly kill the baby after it was born. It sort of ruined the movie for me thinking about that until I realized that’s not what it was ha. ,8a5qdo
dwxqei0,Maybe it would be a reserve MASH and the smothered baby would turn in to a chicken,8a5qdo
dx26geo,"I feel like such a monster. When that scene was going on I just thought about how I would smother the noise the baby was making then when I realized, she would rather die then let that creature harm her baby I felt awful lol ",8a5qdo
dx25mfr,"Same! At first I thought the monster was eating/had eaten the baby in that scene, cause it looked like it was bent over eating something and you couldn't see the baby in the crib. Then as she was behind the waterfall holding the baby I was cringing in fear of her having to smother it. ",8a5qdo
dxcq0bm,My fucking heart jumped when i saw the baby crib was open i thought the monster ate him. I'm really glad they didn't go that way.,8a5qdo
dwxlej4,Wait. Did they another a baby in the finale of MASH?(!),8a5qdo
dwy21v1,"Damnit, you had to bring the mash finale up",8a5qdo

dwzg3ho,I have flashbacks to Amnesia the Dark Descent. ,8a5qdo
dx0q21n,I thought the entire movie was testing the theory 'if people are hunting you and you have to stay quiet would you smother your baby to save the group or risk it',8a5qdo
dx1lj8f,i thought for sure a baby death scene was inevitable.,8a5qdo
dx1p05b,That was the very first thing I thought of too. I was bracing for it and WAS SO GLAD it didn't come to that.,8a5qdo
dx23l4l,I was scared she'd end up pulling a Crying Wolf on the baby.,8a5qdo
dx7kdqe,She made such a point of “who are we if we can’t protect them” that all i could picture for some reason was her leaving the baby on the foot of the bed and curling up in the corner as the monster attacked it,8a5qdo
dx87vp6,"My first thought was it was drowning or near drowning when she woke up. I didn't think that thing would be floating or water tight. In that situation, I think it'd play out more as abandonment or some kind of ""passive"" action from her",8a5qdo
dxo8xxh,I saw the thing in the corner and thought for sure it had eaten the baby while she slept but also I was left to wonder wtf how are they safe in the river if it fucking swims,8a5qdo
e2j7d20,During the Rwandan genocide it is reported that one of the mother's had to do that. ,8a5qdo

Damn it why did you make me remember that.",8a5qdo
e1y1vcs,"I’m an idiot, that scene at the start with the mask and the box I thought was a coffin and they were gonna gas it and kill it immediately. Made me think this is a hell of a macabre movie",8a5qdo
dwwmex2,This is one of those movies I wish I hadn't seen a trailer for. The second I saw that kid I was waiting for that scene. I'm just happy they got it out of the way earlier. Though I didn't expect the result to be what it was.,8a5qdo
dwx2vjd,I knew I was in for a ride when that kid got rekted. From the trailer I expected Big Tuna to reach him just in time and throw the rocket into the woods.,8a5qdo
dwxzpx1,The kids send off was important. It set the tone. It was like killing Drew Barrymore in Scream. It let the audience know don't take anything for granted. ,8a5qdo
dwx8a7f,"Thought the exact same thing! I was like ""ooooo, setting up the ending from GET, I like it---       ....Oh.... Nevermind...""",8a5qdo
dwy9bi4,I wondered why Lee left the batteries on the counter when they have flashlights that could probably use those.,8a5qdo
dwx4spq,I literally said the same thing to my mate lmao,8a5qdo
dwy4lbr,"lol, i thought the opposite, that the batteries/rocket were going to harm them down the line. i did not expect it to happen that quickly.",8a5qdo
dwyblrf,"Unfortunately for me, the whole bridge scene bar the actual part the kid gets caught, was shown on my local news station and my first exposure to the film, which convinced me to watch it the next night blind.

If being around noisey things allowed you to make noise, why didn't they gradually build a bunch of noisey things around their homestead, like speakers constantly playing white noise, so that the creatures would just think of it as background noise and they could just live normally.

Also, since the creatures follow any noise they hear, wouldn't it be pretty easy to rig up dozends of noise distraction traps around the house, instead of just the one firework thing?

A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull.

 It was understood pretty much by all kids: those rock piles are so large they're like quicksand. They're filled with air pockets and it only takes one caving in to take you under. Grain is even more dangerous than sand or gravel because their smoother texture makes them shift more easily.

2) “yeah sure, I’ll do your movie and help you out” — basically a pity answer since both know she’s a huge A-list celebrity and he’s more low-key (when she was filming Mary Poppins in England and he flew to visit, and he had the beard, the weariness of long travel, no makeup, long travel comfort clothes, and a London customs agent asked whom he was there to visit. “My wife.” “Whos your wife? Would I know her, is she an actress too?” “Emily Blunt.” “You? *You?” Arrested Development style. “Emily Blunt married *you*?”, more incredulous statement than question.  And he basically stamped his passport with disdain and let him through)

And that’s when he said

3) Don’t tell her about it

Turns out, she really wanted to read the script, loved it, recommended John to recommend that part to one of their friends...until it ate at her that she really wanted the part. And of course, he gave his wife the part.

It’s a shame people can’t see Signs in the theater with it packed and no idea what is happening. Seeing the trailers made the movie even scarier (We know Mel is going to get his knife grabbed under the door; but it doesn’t happen and he begins to walk away and we all exhale and figure they cut the sce — holy fuck he went back AhHH!) the same way the IT-Pennywise slow-mo film reel made the film scarier.

the son dying in the open sets the tone that you can die at any moment even if you're careful it just takes one fuck up

the reason most of the scenes in the movie were so good is exactly that sense of danger and people curled up in a ball like you describe.  but for me all of that goes to waste when nobody dies and theres no pay out.  something in the back of my head gets more convinced no one is going to die each time they are put in a dangerous situation and no one dies. and that undoes the whole movie, building scenes around danger and death doesn't work if ultimately there is none",8a5qdo

Of course using normal logic, why on earth would you bring that danger to your family and the baby itself. But realistically it would happen regardless in a realistic situation. 

I got the vibe that Jim and Emily Blunt were planning on doing everything they could to protect the baby. But they were also realistic and were getting the kids ready to live a life without them. In my head canon they were willing to die with the baby and have the other two kids survive alone. They wouldn’t come out and tell the kids that but instead just start a fast track learning course so they are prepared when the possible death would come to both parents. ",8a5qdo

I just would have done it so much more sensibly.  And I wouldn't just leave gaping holes in my survival structures where these deadly creatures could just happen to wander it at ANY and EVERY point.

And I would teach the family to play possum when something happens.  Don't get up and start walking around shining flashlights to see if bad things are coming.  No you stop and DROP and stay there for 30 minutes.

Also, there are clearly a dozen families nearby, do people never gather?  Never talk to each other and form plans and help out?

No one makes traps to kill these things?

No one has pre-planned distractions?

Jesus christ how hard is it to have a handgun tied to a tree with a 100 foot piece of string tied to the trigger?

There's gotta be hundreds or thousands of guns around that town with ammo, why can't you have things prepared for emergencies?

If you knew a baby was coming, why didn't you make a better soundproof room?  There's a whole town, just take all of the blankets and pillows from all of the houses and make a fort.  And make a fort around that fort in that room in the basement.  And here's a great idea, pick a better way to block entrance to that basement than a MATTRESS.  Something where a bad thing can't idly stumble into it.  

Sigh.

There's no reason why the dad had to sacrifice himself.

Half the people in the theater I was in laughed when she shot the one in the electronic basement like ""This whole time you could have just shot them!?"" but clearly they didn't think about what that sound would do.  They all should have watched more zombie movies, I knew what was coming.

Plus there's no telling what they're electricity situation is like; they obviously have SOME, to power the lights outside, but they also use lanterns and candles for light, and cooked their fish in what looked like more of an underground dutch oven type of deal(?) so it seemed like they didn't have enough electricity to do more than the lights outside, the cameras, and the TVs and radio. They have extremely limited resources, so it's believable that they couldn't just take action with every ""Why not this?"" idea. At least that's how it seems to me. ",8a5qdo

Now you could live by the waterfall during the wet season  and on the farm during the dry, but then you would have to maintain two houses. Also they had a pretty strict lifestyle not only to be cautious in their home but also in the outside world. So living near a waterfall might make you too relaxed and not have the discipline it would take to survive. ",8a5qdo

dx1oqnn,"I was lucky, this movie had the theater so quiet you could hear the guy struggling with allergies breathing. It wasn't until the end when the sound was finally kicking up that I heard someone seize the opportunity to break open their sour patch kids.

It's pretty smart. We aren't all holding our breath just from tension, but there is an immersive element to the audience all taking part in the dead silence. Definitely upped the experience for me.

They find their seats and after about ten minutes of understanding what’s going on (“why is it so quiet?”) promptly shut the fuck up. They did think a lot of shit was funny though when it wasn’t.

Then 2 people complained about their chairs, so during the opening scenes, new chairs were being hauled in. Then the latecomers proceeded to eat exceptionally loud, talk during the movie, and make excessive noise with their drinks. It was...annoying, to say the least. And super distracting from what I really wanted to focus on. I knew it wasn't going to be a 'respectful and quiet audience' type of crowd because I know how the people in my area are. After about 5 minutes, I had such a desire to literally stand up, tell them to pause the movie, make everyone sit the fuck down in their assigned seats, order all of their food and then restart the movie.

So somehow these creatures were very quietly killing a lot of people off without being detected when they first started popping up. Especially since the little boy was snatched up in an instant.

They appear to also have an insane amount of strength. My interpretation was that Emily Blunt's character was only able to kill the creature because it was already severely weakened by the radio frequencies. If it hadn't been, I don't think shooting it would have done much.",8a5qdo
dwwfzzu,"On some of the newspaper print outs, it said the creatures skin/armor was immune to bombs/bullets.  I barely caught it :)",8a5qdo

dwxe6zj,"The one thing I'm amazed isn't higher in this thread, and it makes me feel like it was explained and I missed it... how did they have power?",8a5qdo
dwxy62v,"In places with a lot of auditory stimuli, I imagine they can basically ""see"". So, in most cities, they'd probably be on equal footing with humans in terms of navigation and they've got the leg up with their insane speed/seemingly endless energy/armor plating/ability to cut people in half in less than a second.",8a5qdo
dwwg5ul,"From what I gathered reading the newspapers when they were on the screen, I noticed one mentioning “Bulletproof Armor”. The only time I saw the creatures as vulnerable was when they were listening intently and/or weakened by the hearing aid. Armor comes back revealing whatever is used to track the noise. Whenever they were running, attacking, etc, it appeared that their entire body was covered and completely armored with no weak points. 

Obviously, we didn’t see enough of them to REALLY judge too much, but that’s what I got from it. I could see how they’d be able to take over the world pretty easily, considering most of the people killed were gone almost instantaneously. ",8a5qdo
dwxxc3l,[deleted],8a5qdo
dwyenf3,Obviously I think the movie really wasn't trying to answer the big plot questions about the creatures and just focus on a small story of a family but let's bear in mind that this was a pretty remote town and it may have been that some of the larger more populated places were able to fight off the creatures or hide from them but getting out to the most remote parts of Upstate New York may not have been a priority for them,8a5qdo
dwzhfoc,"I also don’t really understand how the took over the *whole* planet, considering the meteorite landed in Mexico. North and South America? Sure, they seem like the could run pretty fast. Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia? No way. How would they even get there?",8a5qdo
dwwmd69,"I think the whole thing about the ""weakness"" is it's not only 'bothered' by that high pitched sound.. thing, it's also that once it is exposed to the high pitched sound, it lets its armor down, or maybe it got so disoriented that it let its armor down. If you remember, it was mentioned that it had armor so I think just shooting or bombing them normally wouldn't have worked or they would have died a lot faster, for sure. It was just no one figured out how to nerf their armor.",8a5qdo
dwwcxic,"I think on one of the newspaper clippings in the basement there was a claim that guns, bombs, etc. couldn’t destroy these bad boys.  

At the same time, Ms. Blunt blew the head off of one, so not sure how they could survive a bomb.",8a5qdo
dx0klw3,"But it’s not like it’d attract all the creatures all over the world tho. It seems like they’re fairly localized and spread out, like it said on the board there were three in that area.


If something like this happened in real life you’d have to imagine the logistics would be ridiculous. How would you setup a display like that without attracting additional noise? How do you effectively communicate that early enough without everyone knowing sign language?

The daughter was dead so they had an inherent advantage, now imagine trying to coordinate something like that on a massive scale without making any noise and having limited communication? To top it off if people were randomly dying off and being attacked and people were getting into a panic then how many people are realistically going to be working?


I’m sure they would’ve attempted something like that but it’d just be a clusterfuck. Realistically there were a few days to a week where these creatures were new and people were afraid and trying to keep some normalcy. And yeah the military probably would’ve been setting something like this up but I feel like any sort of major commotion especially in large population hubs was just a death sentence.",8a5qdo

For another, most of this movie took place > 400 days after the initial contact, so we're talking more than a year here. For another, we know they hate electronic devices and seek to destroy them when found, so I'm guessing they would destroy your AC/DC PA system pretty quickly.

The one plot hole I can't figure out is how where they able to keep electricity on in their farm? Was the electrical grid somehow still operating even without people, or were they somehow silently generating electricity for the farm? All those incandescent lightbulbs alone would take a shit ton of wattage to power.",8a5qdo

dy588jb,"Yeah, the entire time I was just thinking about ways to kill them like that. Do they did in Tremors. Lure them to a location using sound and then detonate pre-placed explosives. Shoot them with high caliber guns. I know they're ""armored"" but they don't seem to be able to fly so they really don't have a way to defend themselves against an Apache gunship. ",8a5qdo

dx06mic,"I asked my wife this and she responded that it's instinctual to reproduce when you're in danger, which it is.

So I was at the San Diego zoo safari park and the zoo keeper said that when they had all the gazelle alone and distanced from predators, they got fat and lazy and didn't reproduce. But when they put the predator exhibits near the large safari plain, where the gazelle and antelope could smell and hear them, they began taking care of themselves and reproducing and even sitting in circles facing outward like they do in the wild. So, having children in this situation is kind of a survival instinct. And I read the other day that escaped slave on the underground railroad gave their kids opium to keep them quiet. 

",8a5qdo

dwzvapn,"We had a family of seven (yes family. Like, as in a 2 and 5 year old for this movie) come in about 20 minutes after the start. They went to the top of a packed theater and half the family walked down the entire aisle. Then, the half that stayed put and the half that crossed both turned on phone lights and talked to each other about finding a seat. When people complained or said something, instead of apologizing, the person said ""I paid my money, I'm find a fucking seat"". This is not a movie to bring kids to or to be loud at, at All! Worst movie experience I've ever had. ",8a5qdo
dww3fl5,"A key part of the film is the lack of communication with the outside world. We enter the world on day 87 (ish?) where everything seems to have gone to shit, Krasinski also shows his radio efforts have been fruitless. Military branches would have an idea of what works against the creatures. The first newspaper shot reads ""Sound is the key"" which shows this information is likely near the end of mass media. Lots of corners in the world probably had an idea of what could lead to a weapon or means to survive the invasion early on, but here is the thing:


It was an invasion.


These things hit hard and fast, and didn't make sense to the world so they won. But pockets of people went on to survive, we see that through the flame beacons. In the end, this isn't the story of a deaf girl figuring out their weakness for the world, it's the story of how a family was saved by each other. Every character, minus the baby, saved another character's life. On a small family scale of survival, could anyone else really find this weakness? Who in their right mind would mess with sound, the very thing that means certain death, other than a father trying to restore his daughter's hearing because he loves her?",8a5qdo
dww2kft,well if they kill based on sound my guess was there was a lot less than 7 billion people on the planet pretty quick. especially with how fast they are,8a5qdo
dww2w41,"In fairness, she figured out their weakness *because* she is deaf.  Even if others figured it out you've gotta imagine communicating their weakness is an issue.  This particular family was lucky in having a deaf daughter as it likely made adapting to communicating in silence easier.  There could very well be safe havens set up but given that this family seemed to live in a pretty rural area there's a good chance they would never know ",8a5qdo
dww39ic,"to be fair, other people could have found their weakness across the globe, it's not like Jim and his family had much communication with the outside world! I'm assuming they probably met with the other people lighting up their campfires at dusk, but he's not getting radioed by people in LA or something",8a5qdo
dwxuldu,"OR... other people have figured it out. A man in Japan. A girl in Iceland. Whomever you’d like to surmise. But once they figure it out, they can’t really tell anyone too far away how to kill the things. You could have word spread slowly but unless someone sorted it out one town over in Upstate NY, then Jim Halpert’s fam isn’t going to know about it yet. ",8a5qdo
dww7233,But for all we know other countries and people could have figured it out too. The farm was cut off from the rest of the world and we never see first hand what other countries are up to.,8a5qdo
dww5cjq,"Yeah, the second I saw that sweet del Toro ear design, I knew that that'd be their obvious weakness. Standard video-game logic to aim for the glowing spots. It made sense with the poetic hearing aid and the father's endless sacrifice, but I too think one of the myriad governments would have thought of that counterattack method. Easily applied by smarter minds than me to hook up to a town's tornado alarm system. ",8a5qdo
dww39h9,"Yeah, this is the hardest part to believe. We see from the newspaper scraps that the military at least tried fighting them for a while, and it’s known that the creatures have some sort of EMP effect and use sound to their advantage. 

With that in mind, don’t you think the military would have tried blasting these things with EMP pulses and every audio frequency imaginable? The military already uses sound as a weapon against human targets, so it’s a big stretch to think they wouldn’t use it against these things. 

Still loved the movie, though. ",8a5qdo
dww2w1j,"Well it's not like they were able to communicate with the world, they were isolated apart from the others in the distance so even if people did find out how to defeat them they wouldn't be able to easily spread it around",8a5qdo
dww78be,"There are other people who are still alive. The fires showed that. 

Maybe somewhere else someone has figured that out too, but there's clearly no way of long distance communication, so how would people know? ",8a5qdo
dww71a8,Or other people figured it out but they have no way to communicate with others to know that.,8a5qdo
dxh0u8k,"The more you think about this movie the less it makes sense honestly. The fact that there were old newspapers with headlines like ""ITS SOUND! STAY QUIET STAY ALIVE!"" yet were somehow printed by the thousands and then distributed across the U.S was weird to me. The fact that they didn't live nearer to the river where they were able to talk normally was weird to me. In fact, why even live in silence where if you cough too loud you're fucked? Why not live somewhere like next to the god damn waterfall where you can scream at the top of your lungs? I don't know why they spent time making a fucking light system that changes colors around their farm when they could've set up a speaker system that blares loud sirens so that they can talk normally. Also how did the father discover he could yell behind the waterfall? When was the first time he even tried that",8a5qdo
dwwcua3,No where in the movie did it hint that no one has found their weakness anywhere else. We saw just this one family and their small farm. Maybe there's entire cities elsewhere that have radio frequency guarding it around the clock. ,8a5qdo

3: She is more capable, meaning the boy needed the training, not her. She also needed to be there in case her mother needed help.

4: Not sure on this one, seems she is just very self aware maybe?

5: I'm sure they sleep with something like a fan to drown out noise.

6: How would they test it? By inviting a monster over and seeing if it finds them?

7: Why would they want to stay in a tiny basement 24/7?

8: This is one that annoyed me, my only guess is that she is pregnant and lazy haha

9: Maybe they didn't have access to one, its clear their answer was fireworks instead.

10: I'm guessing the grain was falling out of the bottom of the container, causing it to pull them down.

12: Surface area.

Yet they can't hear your beating heart when in the same room with you. If their hearing was that sensitive, no one could possibly escape whenever the monsters were close.

But then there go any tense scenes where the family is trapped in a room with the creatures, etc. Obviously, if there was exposition, one could explain this fluke by learning the monsters are actually deaf in certain frequencies, hence not being able to hear a beating heart or simple not responding to certain sounds for whatever alien reason (as the creatures are extraterrestrial in origin).",8a5qdo

The high frequency sound was created because the father modified a cochlear implant sound processor using parts of regular hearing aids for some stupid reason because it obviously wouldn't work.

What they get right: on the first scene the girl was wearing a sound processor made by Cochlear (a CI company) and about 400 days later she was wearing an Advanced Bionics sound processor (a competitor). A sound processor (external device) from a brand couldn't work with the implant (internal piece) from other brand. 

This is why she can't hear anymore and this is why the father keeps trying to fix it. It would be impossible unless he had access to a specific audiologist equipment, a Cochlear sound processor and access to the settings of the original sound processor (program). That way he could recover the original program and copy to a new processor.

> no deaf person is aware when their aid is ringing

I don't think she was aware the device was ringing. The monster presence affected electronics. When a monster was near her, her cochlear implant antenna was affected by it. It happens IRL when a CI user walks through [store security alarms](http://www.easretailsecuritysystem.com/photo/pl2926266-retail_security_devices_rf_eas_alarm_system_8_2mhz_high_sensitivity_for_drug_store.jpg) that works on the same frequency of their CIs. The interference is inaudible to people but audible to a CI user.

Also, when the monster was near, the hearing aid parts attached to it could emit the high frequency audible sound that annoys the monster.

Not only that, very loud noises such as a waterfall would probably attract creatures to the area. This is all ended up being spurious to the driving action of the plot, which is that on a long enough time scale, you're going to make a noise that's going to be heard, regardless of where you are, especially because they clearly had echolocation. 

As for sound as a weapon, they simply destroyed loud noises that interfered with their hunting, such as the TV in the final scene.

dxq4d15,"As I understood it, it wasn't just a high-pitched noise that was their weakness. They seemed to have some sort of electromagnetic sense (the lights flickered whenever they were near), and the clicks they made when they dilated their ears seemed like echolocation or something similar, and that sound was causing feedback in the girl's hearing aid. The creatures itself is the source of the sound she uses to disable it. If it doesn't make that sound, the hearing aid is no use.

As for the military, the creatures are only shown making the high-pitched sound when they are trying to detect very quiet sounds (someone in the same room). If the sounds are loud, they just pounce, and don't open of the flaps around their head, or do the click thing. The military is going to be loud enough for them to detect with their defenses fully up.

You only have to buy that they are impervious to harm when the flaps are closed, and susceptible when they are open, to explain way the military cannot stop them.",8a5qdo

The moment where he signs ""I've always loved you"" it cuts back to him - full sound - and you hear [the yell](#spoiler)...

> And you figure using high pitch noises to hurt the monsters would be the first thing the military would have tried after realizing they have super good hearing

few points:

- we don't know what other people have tried or know
- How would you safely test that given that you know for sure that loud noises attract them?
- It isn't obvious at all that you could kill something by giving it lots of the thing which seems to set them off. If you know that blood attracts sharks, would you try to kill it with lots of blood?",8a5qdo

Biggest problem I had with it is: Why didn't somebody realize immediately that high pitched noises could be a potential solution to beings that rely entirely on sound? The military has underground bunkers right? A protected and completely isolated location to test such a weapon.

The parents in this film obviously try to build some semblance of normal life for their children because that's what is important to them -- their family and actually *living* (as opposed to merely surviving).

Consider the waterfall scene. Was it the safest thing to do to show the son the waterfall and scream? Or even have a vocal conversation next to the river? Probably not, why would you even risk it? But this scene provides a vehicle for the father to empower his son. He shows his son that the monsters have limitations and weaknesses. He can remove some of his son's fear this way.

If their goal was exclusively to survive they would be far more controlling and be even more careful, perhaps taking some of the steps people in this thread have mentioned.

dzjaofq,"Sorry for the late reply, but I wanna pitch my two cents in here.

1. It was a dumb move, but we humans are weird. We can say we would do a certain action in any given situation, but that's because we have the time to think about it. In the situation, in the moment, there's no time to think, so we end up doing stupid stuff. Think about all the cringey moments in your own life. Such as spilling a secret or laughing at a joke at an inappropriate time. We always do stupid stuff even when beforehand we say we wouldn't. (But it was still a dumb move for the dad to sacrifice himself.)

2. I agree. However, I like to give movie characters the benefit of the doubt, like I would to real-life people. Like I said, people are dumb, we all are. Sometimes when you list out things you have to prioritize, you end up forgetting some things to put on the list. As such, you might forget to clean up the dead cockroach or turn off your oven before you leave your house, even when you've been planning to do that for hours or even days. However, the pictures are literally RIGHT IN FRONT of the movie's characters, so I'd think it would be obvious to put those damn pictures and fix up the stairs, especially because it means life or death.

3. I'm also curious about where the monsters came from. Theories are that they're aliens. I would suppose they invaded human cities in full force with thousands of their monster soldiers and decimated the world's urban areas, leaving only small rural communities to survive. After all, if the military were still around and aware of these monsters, wouldn't they have easily killed all those things with bombs? Even 'impenetrable exoskeletons' can be destroyed with military explosives, such as anti-tank rockets.",8a5qdo

Re: Neighbors, why would they be killed? The point of the fireworks was to mask noises so the creatures couldn't detect you. The neighbors should have been safer than ever while the fireworks were going off and would have certainly known it was a distress signal and taken refuge. 

Re: More creatures, I don't think we saw more than the three creatures the entire film.

dycxfzy,Do you think there should be a sequel?,8a5qdo
dykf7io,"I actually thought they did a good job of taking the concept seriously and problem solving within the established rules of the universe.    
  
Most of these 'plot holes' and issues with the logic are people either not paying attention to the film or expecting these people to behave like perfectly trained military survivalists.  ",8a5qdo
dyxzs2g,I think it is closer to westworld than Halloween in regards to how seriously it took itself. And yeah the plot holes would have bothered me less otherwise,8a5qdo
e1azcae,"But their sound detection is so sensitive that it pretty much overcomes their blindness. If you're able to live in complete silence like the family did you can survive, but it's a miserably tough existence",8a5qdo
e1ez7xg,"I assumed the monsters used echolocation.  The clicks they constantly make are sharp and they hear well enough, they probably detect what's around them by the sound pictures they get from their sonar, kind of.  They'd have to, almost, to be able to navigate forests and cornfields and stairs like they do so quickly.  Since nearly everything makes noises most of the time, a hunter would know to target only the things which make the sounds of prey, and these have been around long enough to get used to the ambient forest sounds, so things like glass breaking or people screaming make wholly unique sounds that would stick out like a sore thumb to their sonic perception of the world around them.  Small noises like walking on sand or heartbeats would blend in to the background noise of wind and grass rustling and dead leaves and stuff, even close up it would be hard to say whether something was vibrating because it was alive or because wind was blowing against it.  They're also probably constantly hearing their own organ systems gurgling and pulsing and whatever else they have going on in there.  

If anything, my main gripe about the movie is that they didn't set up more sound-based distractions or traps.  A ringing bell over a fire pit or at the end of a pole over a cliff or in a cage or something.  I guess the idea is it happened super fast and they're in a rural area with little organization beyond a family unit, but if you can rig remote fireworks and special light systems, I'd think you can make traps, too.  I imagine also, elsewhere in more dense population areas, someone would've noticed how they open their heads to hear by now and used that against them, and someone would've thought ""hey they hear super good, like dogs, and dog whistles hurt dog ears, so maybe if we make a super high pitch whistle it'll hurt these things, too?""  

The movie was paced well and the threat was apparent and present and good throughout.  It just seems like this might have been an isolated ""good horror movie"" setting in an otherwise short-lived event.  Kind of like how zombies would decay quickly and become nonfunctioning within a couple months at most, so the spread and threat both drop dramatically after the initial zompocalypse unless some factor is urging it along (like Umbrella Corp).
",8a5qdo
e2ksxcp,"So I don't think that speakers would have worked. As we saw in the final scene, the creature destroyed the TV that was giving static feedback. This shows that any amplifiers or noisemakers would just be destroyed. All that would accomplish would be to attract more of the creatures to your area. Once they hear a noise in a particular area they seemed to keep searching it until they found something or until some other noise distracted them. It seems best to not be on their radar at all. I think that is why the newspapers had the headlines to be quiet or get underground.

In terms of killing them, the movie doesn't really go into much detail as to how they are so impervious to attack. We see a few newspaper clippings saying that they couldn't be killed and that the military failed to stop them but that's about it. It was to my understanding that the noise emitted from the hearing aid weakened them to the point where they were susceptible to an attack. We saw the flaps on its head coming apart and it looked like it was having an extreme adverse effect on the creature. It is my interpretation that this made it vulnerable to the final shotgun blow. Also as far as anyone was concerned, the knowledge of their weakness wasn't discovered yet and therefore couldn't have been used to lay a trap. Now if they movie continued on after this discovery, than that is a different story.",8a5qdo
e2ho3uv,My interpretation was that the monster was only weakened in that specific state because of the feedback/ochlear onslaught. That they were able to shoot it in the head specifically because it had its head armor flared back and ear holes opened. ,8a5qdo
e2gufck,">  we see in the end that a shotgun to the head kills them, so they're not invulnerable.

But the whole military wasn't able to harm them. *Literally* undestroyable...

I don't want to overthink this too much, but like you said, attracting them via sound and then detonating a bomb or picking them out one by one via helicopter shouldn't be that hard. It's not like they could fly.

So much wrong with the plot of that movie.

And why have another baby? My daily shit would be dangerous enough, why bring an uncontrollable loud baby in a world like this.

A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them?

The monster that came to investigate his noise was repelled by the daughter's hearing aide.

>Then on the opposite end, when the father gets swiped by the fella on the roof, he wasn't making any (particular) noise. 

He made the noise of pulling the axe from the bin when he was being directly observed by the monster from like 2 feet away. We also can infer the monsters echolocate and he was standing in the wide open. He sent his kids to the truck because the truck would block the echolocation.

There were still issues with the monster's logic though. It should've heard the truck roll off. They also slam the doors a couple of times which is a pretty big error. But all of these instances you mentioned are pretty easily explained.

2) **the piano score that was playing when the sound monster is on the truck and right before Jim Halpert sacrifices himself...is that an original piece of music?** I feel like i’ve Heard that in several trailers now (maybe ***“this is us”*** on nbc???) but can’t seem to place it.

What. That's dumb.  Hunger Games was just a paradigm change to normal life.  They live in a autocratic society where life isn't valued by the rich and powerful, but it's still life.

You can see pictures of the military trying to fight them and obviously failing.

There's not actually any shelter near the waterfall and gathering materials and building one would likely be prohibitively noisy and time consuming, and the baby is going to scream constantly for literally years until it grows enough of a brain to understand ""shut up or you'll die"" so just leaving it under a waterfall for three years probably isn't a real solution.

Waterfall sound masking from one small device? I think they’re smarter than that. They can tell what’s not it like they smashed the tv because of too much white noise.

I mean, set up disposable speakers somewhere, hit remote button to summon every big nasty to one place. Set them up in multiple places so when one gets thrashed you have a spare.

This is reinforced with the old man in the woods. Remember the wife saying the children will take care of them in old age? That scene sets up what happens if they don't have someone to take care of them, that they eventually are still lambs to the slaughter.

It's easy for us as visitors to their world to think on the short term survival, but having the child is essential to long term life, and survival of the species. ",8a5qdo

Ok, so to kill the aliens, Regan's cochlear implant (and, yes, it was a cochlear implant, not a hearing aid. A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them?

This kinda leads to the whole after 80+ days of surviving they most likely were still getting use to this new lifestyle and were exhausted, their minds drifting to just the next minute and got complacent. In the military we have a famous saying ""compliancy kills"" and that scene is basically sums up that quote. The parents got complacent with their routine, the walking on sand slowly thing had been working for 80+ days, they were tired, and just trying to get back to camp or arrive at their future camp.

Joked and talked nonstop through the previews, then everyone went silent during the movie.

dwywspo,"Without more context, we can assume anything is possible. It's possible that the military did kill a lot of them, but eventually got overrun. We don't know how quickly and easily those aliens breed, especially in a nutrient rich environment like Earth.",8a5qdo
dwyzo79,"I'm firmly convinced they have some kind of supernatural element to them. Their hearing is way beyond what should be physically possible, sound waves from things like talking and dropping things in a basement from miles away shouldn't be audible over ambient noise, doesn't matter how sensitive your hearing is. The sound waves just won't go that far. 

There's also how they interfere with electricity around them. And the newspapers say they are bulletproof - the thickness of their armour is definitely not thick enough to stop a 50. cal. Even a .308 should be able to punch through. So why are they still bulletproof? I know it's implied they came to earth on a meteor, but I don't think they fully obey the laws of physics either.",8a5qdo

It would also explain why the military didn't just blast them with noise, as the exact required frequency was pure luck for the characters to stumble upon",8a5qdo
dx415es,"See the thing is we have no context whatsoever. Were there tens of thousands of these? Were there millions? The military has to deploy to an area and set up perimeters and defensive positions in order to combat these things or they'll get overwhelmed. Also, these are extremely fast and you have to hit them *in the head* to kill them. 

The military are *people* and they are going to abandon their posts to save their loved ones. They have to be able to mobilize heavy equipment too because a tiny .223 or a .308 isn't going to do much to them. The monster had to have it's face open and exposed and take a shotgun almost point blank to die.

There's soooo many reasons the military couldn't defeat these things and if you let little things like that bug you then I can't imagine you enjoy a lot of movies. ",8a5qdo

dwzz9vu,"I disagree because the movies explore different themes imo. It Comes At Night asks whether it is better to just protect the ones closest to you or help others, and creates a conflict between those two sentiments. A Quiet Place is just about protecting family, so it never really creates a conflict.

A Quiet Place shows how sticking to a set of rules keeps you alive, whereas It Comes At Night shows that setting up rules in the first place is futile. A big scary monster can be seen and understood, a disease can’t.

A Quiet Place was still an excellent movie, though.",8a5qdo
dwzycjy,It comes at night was pretentious. I'm sorry. But this movie was good,8a5qdo
dx19jox,she didn't even know the monster was behind her the first time,8a5qdo
dx19wg5,"After I finished the movie, I kept thinking about how the girl would have been absolutely PLAGUED with guilt later. She already felt like she had the baby brother's death hanging over her head, then her dad was killed because she didn't quite figure it out quickly enough. Followed by her finding the equipment her father had been tinkering with on her behalf.  Devastating. ",8a5qdo
dx1msje,"Part of it I have to imagine is that she doesn't really have a perfect understanding (intuitively, that is) of how sound/hearing works. To her, hearing is a sense that's just as foreign to her as some sort of ESP/telepathy/ability to see non-visible light like radiowaves/heat, etc. would be to a non-hearing-impaired person. The cochlear implant was hurting her each time the creatures used echolocation just as it was hurting the creatures, and it was probably a sensory overload to suddenly experience really hearing anything substantial for the first time in such an intense and unpleasant way. Combine that with the fear and the lack of awareness during the first encounter, and I find it believable that she wouldn't have put it all together until after several instances. ",8a5qdo
dx1dnob,"I think it's hard to make the deduction that your hearing equipment is passively affecting the creatures when your mind is focused on fear, survival, grief, and guilt. She was only able to figure it out at the end because the hearing aids reminded her of her father, who she was still thinking about. That helped her remember the strange situation when the high pitch ring happened when a creature was nearby, and that it forced it to retreat. She still wasn't 100% sure that it would work, that's why she turned it on slowly near the end.",8a5qdo
dx19sia,"That’s a really good point.  At first I just gave her the benefit of the doubt because she is just a kid, but she did know how to broadcast the signal using the radio equipment at the end so we know she is smart.  Maybe the sheer adrenaline in the moment?  But they’re literally in the same room with a creature at the end.  Maybe she just needed a few more cues like the “Weakness” note on the wall and all the other news articles?

Also wanted to point out there were three separate times : in the field (she wasn’t aware of this though), in the silo, and in the car before she turned off her hearing aid.",8a5qdo

dx54cou,"Of course they would have. The first thing they would have done was to try and find a flaw in these creatures ""strength"", which is sound. And there are plenty of examples in nature - sonar using predators (bats) are often thwarted by their prey with sonar jamming frequencies.  If a teenage girl with a homemade hearing device can stumble upon their flaw, it's logical to assume the militaries & scientists of the planet would discover it as well. ",8a5qdo

dx53krj,"There probably are military bases and stuff out there with sonic defences but with no real way to spread the knowledge around, especially to a random family living on a farm outside a small town",8a5qdo
dx53elt,"That's a valid question, but I think the implication was that the creatures hit with such force, that there was no time to really put two and two together during the onslaught. Also, the mother blowing the creature's head off made total sense, as she was able to get up close to its unprotected face while it was disoriented. The soldiers were dealing with the creatures at their full capacity, and probably didn't have a chance in hell, especially that close.",8a5qdo

dx5y7da,[deleted],8a5qdo
dxj8owy,"I didn't really get the sense that they did (although I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention to the ""world-building"" in this one, tbh). I thought the point of showing the dad lighting the signal was to show that everyone just had to learn to adapt quick by moving to areas where it'd be a lot easier to live quiet and hopefully secluded from large gangs of monsters. Those in loud congested cities would have died really quick, which is why the city is desolate. I'd also guess living in big communes would be dangerous since it'd only take one moron making a sound to put everyone in danger, so it makes sense people would rather go it alone? That was my thought process, anyway.

It did seem strange that the military didn't play much of a role at all in any part of the film, but I guess we don't know how much of the military is left/what resources they have by the time the main story starts up, so I didn't really consider it a huge plot hole.",8a5qdo
dxj278p,"i looked for little hints in the movie. in the beginning it shows a tossed paper on the ground saying ""IT'S SOUND!"". which means they did find out and enough time has passed that a news paper company had enough time to print and spread out the paper. there seems to be other news paper and info articles spread out that shows that they might have been there a long time 

i think any military would have a hard time containing these things to study them since the can move very fast, jump high and can slice into thick metal with ease. they might have just tried to fight them of as quickly as possible. they could have spread from a certain area and gave people who lived farther away a chance to survive. they might be able to wipe people out quicker than shown in the film given that they only take a person out in a couple scenes.

(edit)i forgot that they did say how many days they were around. i think its safe to say that if 87 days passed and there is that many people gone, the monsters can wipe out almost everything due to numbers or how powerful they are. if two months pass and there is almost no one left. i think its safe to say that whenever they showed up to earth, they got working fast on killing everything. it seems to be present day so our population is 7.4 B right now. if 87 days passed and most of humanity was wiped away, thats about 85M people a day they are going at it. that is higher than the most total deaths in a war. i dont know if any military could keep up with that number.",8a5qdo

*The fireworks that far away are not loud enough to mask a scream from a creature right next to you.*

**My thought on this is that the fireworks initiated their ""GET OVER THERE NOW & KILL"" mode so they didn't have time to physically open their ears..maybe?**

*The creature reveal was a bit too early I think. It was hard to feel worried or unsettled from that point on aside from the jump scares.*

**I think they had to give something upfront to keep the audience engaged and turn us into the ""SSHHH"" police for the dramatic irony which was tied to the death of a child.** 

*While I liked the quiet aspect of the movie, I think it was detrimental to making a connection to the characters. I didn't really care if any of them died tbh.*

**Oh man, you might be right on this other than rooting for humanity to survive.**

*Why are you having a child - an actual ticking time bomb in this sort of world??*

**This would have been the hardest choice to make. By choosing not to breed, you are denying (arguably) your own existence to live on. At what point are you just surviving to survive versus surviving to live. It was clear that no help was coming. By breeding, they chose to continue living on and to clench to a sense of purpose. The best way I can explain what I mean by this is by the following example. I think a number of people would prefer to ""pull the plug"" if they were stuck in a vegetative state rather than just to continue existing. Annnnnndddddddddd I'm rambling. That's. All.**",8a5qdo

See I think was a problem for me. Based on the reviews the movie seemed to try and take itself more seriously than just a routine horror movie. Then it relies on stupid characters to drive the story and create conflict. Which is fine if it's just a simple horror movie, but I think the movie thought it was more than that and I expected it be more as well. It was a very good horror movie with a unique story and great use of sound that's put together well. However, it seemed like it wanted to be more and then betrays that with comically dumb decisions by it's characters. It's definitely worth a watch, but it's not this great movie people are making it out to be. ",8a5qdo
dx0lnuf,"I'm going to try and answer some of your points. 

 i completely agree with living in a old creaky farmhouse not being wise.

- it's established early on that no matter where you are any noise is pretty much a death sentence.
So living on a farm lowers the chances of accidents (e.g. little kid knocking toys off the shelf etc...)

- also because it's based later on in the time line of the invasion suggests trying to survive in heavily populated areas was a bad idea... this is reflected by lighting to camp fires showing other small survivers spread apart as it lowers the chance of accidents or conflict.

The one thing i hated was them not fixing the nail on the step straight away so no one else could step on it.

*When I was training paramedics we pointed out that you can get a rough simulation of the blood pressure without a stethoscope by applying  the blood pressure cuff as you would normally. Then pump it up to 180-200 mm hg watching the needle drop on the meter slowly, as you are slowly releasing the pressure valve at about 2-3 mm Hg per second. When the needle jumps slightly the systolic pressure is about +or- 5mm Hg around that point. Then quickly establish your finger on the radial pulse point at the wrist of the arm the BP Cuff is applied too. Still looking at the dial, exactly when you feel the radial pulse should be the diastolic pressure.

6) She was in the middle of labour when she stepped on the nail. And when she was about to go back up the stairs, the monster walked by up there and then the rest of the movie happened. Too many important things that needed doing, other than a nail. 

But fuck that nail.



10) One of the newspapers had a frontpage about a meteor crash in Mexico. Probably from there.

11) And do what to them? Considering how they had apparently decimated not only the US, but the whole world's military, what is a single guy to do? Try and blow them up? Likely already happened. They are armored after all. 

12) There are 3 beasties in the area. If you had a lot of noise alarms like that, I think you'd likely attract more. Or you'd get killed by the other people nearby. 

14) Live behind the waterfall? I didn't see a very deep cavern where that was possible. A waterfall is extremely loud as well, making it a VERY bad place to sleep near. Try and sleep with something as loud as a waterfall next to you. You'll go nuts in a week. 

15) Would you pull out of Emily Blunt? Really?

16) Kids aren't the smartest humans. That said, someone already brought up that silos aren't the must sturdy. They're made from aluminium and apparently if they're empty, they can actually warp.

18) The wife took her blood pressure in the basement and wrote it on a calendar. The calendar also showed the due date wasn't for another 2 weeks. 

19) She figured that out at the end. And after that, she probably figured out she could have saved her father, if she had done it before he tried out that screaming tactic.

dx8a38o,"I think the film read more as an allegory for the struggles of a family with a disabled family member. Regan's deafness is the single greatest source of risk the family faces on a day to day basis. Everything the family does needs to revolve around her disability or else they could all die.

When her disability leads in part to her brother's death she assumes the effort her family put into accommodating her just breeds resentment. She internalizes that perceived resentment and manages to convince herself that her parents don't love her, and that jer family would be better off without her. She fails to recognize that her deafness is likely the only reason the family was able to learn to communicate so effectively and as a result survive. 

It isn't until her father decides to give his life to save her is she willing to listen when he says he loves her. Parents of children with serious disabilities frequently have to give up partd of their lives to give the extra needed care to there child (social life, career, hobbies, etc). 

Without her father to protect her she must learn to survive in a world that won't accommodate her disability. Even though her father never seemed able to give Regan the love she wanted, he gave her they love that ultimately gave her an opportunity to survive without him. The film ends on an ambiguous note symbolizing the uncertainty of Regan's future once her parents inevitably die.

It was actually a pretty tragic story when you think about it. It's rare a movie so short produces such an emotional impact.",8a5qdo

dxw1cbb,">Why was there always an alien constantly in that house? Once they set off all those fireworks, shouldn't it have led all of them that way? But no, it just seems like there was always one that either came back or stuck around.



The first it went into the house for obvious reasons, nail meets foot, screaming and the picture falling and shattering.

Then it gets lured away by fireworks. They stop and everything is silent, but it also destroyed a water line, the baby cried before it got put into the oxygenized coffing etc. so they definitely made some noise beyond what they normally did.

It seems personally reasonable in the bounds of the setting that one of the creatures that were around the farm got lured to the house (not necessarily the same creature from before that destroyed the waterline) by the baby, water splashing in the cellar and filling it up and also, again, the baby making noise above their normally silent level.

And overal having a creature two times in a home doesnt seem that often especially considering the above mentioned cicumstances.

>I don't see how military would have been depleted with all the underground bunkers we have. Bullproof armor may work for small rounds but the military has much more than that.

More guns doesnt always fix all problems. As seen by the fathers notations and the news articles, the creatures seem more than bullet proof, also extremely fast and themselves rather silent while not relying at all on sight or smell, they could have overrun and hunted humans to near extinction as seen.

I mean fire one gun, and hordes of them will swarm you instantly, or what we dont completely know, they might not swarm but stalk and hunt intelligently and only reverted to this way of hunting because there was no danger from their prey anymore.

>Once they figured out sound is what caused it, shouldn't they have figured out a frequency to fuck them up with? 

Obviously because they get attracted to noise, the louder the noise the better they could hunt, the conclusion that noise hurts them doesnt seem that obvious. Also when they notice that a certain frequency or feedback actually hurts or stuns them, they directly use it to lure and kill a horde.",8a5qdo

And the biggest issue I had with it (aside from the daughter not realizing how her ear implant has been responsible for saving her life twice before *turning it off* before her father died) was that all tension was lost once we found out that her implant was the only viable weapon against the monsters.

It’s like when a video game goes through all this effort to emphasize the only way to survive is to use your wits and the environment, and then just gives you a machine gun mid way through the game and it stops being scary.

The entire thing about sonics being the key to their destruction would be pretty easily solved IRL. We already use LRAD's for riot control and to deter wildlife. There's only 3 left in their particular area of country at the time of the film, so perhaps the combined might of the armed forces took a couple down before eventually everything died.

There's also the possibility that in the beginning the creatures simply weren't as direct as they are in the film. One of the opening shots is of that 'missing persons' board, filled and overfilled with posters. Maybe there was a stealth element in the beginning that they dispensed with after they had suitably depopulated the Earth.

All that aside, as a fan of horror movies, I thought it was one of the best I've seen in the genre in the last several years.

There's also consideration for maintaining the genre. Once the family discovered the weakness the main tension of the film is gone. That means the thriller/horror elements were essentially resolved. Ending the film in an action set piece where theyrun around gunning down monsters would've been like 10 Cloverfield Lane and the while unnecessary sequence with the alien at the end.",8a5qdo
e3mqcit,"Well they never really walked on leaves, mainly sand paths, the only time I can recall them walking on things like that was when the boy ran through the corn field into a tractor, or when they ran in the forest after the old man screamed, but again I think they were on a sand path.    
&nbsp; Also for the wooden floors, you can see tape marks on certain spots, indicating where they should put their feet, which I would assume is why their floors didn't creak, or creak as loudly, as you would expect a wooden floor to creak. They carefully mapped out the strongpoints of the flooring to avoid making sound.    

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Also  I think having a distraction tool isn't super efficient when they're already on top of you, and most of them were split up a lot throughout the movie. If the alien is right by you, it would be dumb to try and move and throw something out there and run, only time a close range distraction worked was when the mother placed the timer long before the alien came downstairs to begin with. But again most of the time they were split up into different groups, with the girl being alone and the boy and father being together. The distractions need to be a bit distanced and someone needs to be there, aware of a threat, to go and cause a distraction in the first place, which seems unlikely.  

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

 I think she's pregnant because although yes, it's risky, they need more people for either the purpose of repopulating the area or getting more help. They won't live forever so they need to raise people to help carry on their legacy and help in the fight against the aliens.     In the movie they never really get compromised from something small like a sneeze, it was really just an object in the house dropping. The first case was the loud shattering of a lantern, which I guess if the creature was far away it should be REALLY hard for it to hear that, but these are aliens from another planet, and who knows how they evolved to hear sound, as we learn they are very sensitive. Space is a vacuum with no sound, and perhaps their atmosphere was very little to allow sound to travel as easily as it does here on earth through air. Who knows.  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

 The husband came late at night because again, he was out with his son teaching him things and wasn't expecting anything major to happen. Based on my knowledge after just watching the movie, she had until the 23rd to give birth. She was checking her blood pressure shortly before the aliens came by and it was about 1-2 weeks before the 23rd, so it came earlier than expected, probably because they had to guestimate.    

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

 I could see the critique about the military and how Earth is a loud place so how could militaries not cause enough sound to bother these things with frequencies etc. With that I can't really understand. From my understanding, they were hard / near impossible to take down with guns, and the only reason the mother could shotgun that one alien in a single shot was because it was severely weakened by the ultra high frequency directed right at it. Who knows how many aliens were directly involved during the invasion of Earth, maybe the world was overwhelmed before they could realize they can weaponize high pitched sounds. But again with all the frequencies of things like our internet and cellphones and tv's etc, Idek how the aliens landed fine in the first place. Might just have to do with the centralization or focusing of the frequencies in one spot rather than spread out in the air. 
    
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Also simulating the sounds of a river with speakers could not only sound artifical but may bring alarm because the aliens may be aware that there is no river in that location and that they're being tricked. If they go up to the speaker and feel it and realize its not water, etc, they might just break it. I was upset that she didn't set up to give birth near the water fall though but again things happened unexpected. And I'm sure the process of building a house is far difficult and louder than just bunkering down where they were. Cutting down trees and getting wood, hammering it in, all that is a long process, and who knows if he had the skills to do that in the first place.    
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

 There's only 3 but it doesn't seem like such a big area that they're patrolling, and they only go to loud sounds. The area seemed pretty empty except for that one old guy and his dead wife, so it's not like they'll have a lot of places to check out on except for where they last heard sounds (wildlife around there + the places the family has been to) And they're also very fast as we saw them run in the end on the TV screens after she shoots the gun.

They can locate the general direction and noise from really far away but if the target moves far enough away when it gets close, they have to  hunt more meticulously with their not as sensitive close quarters hearing.

The daughter tries to be a good older sister and keep him happy while the parents worry about the other son. It's a high stress situation and you are shown later in the movie how much the mom regrets not carrying him and that momentary lapse of judgement.

Also with her being deaf, I got the feeling that Dad felt she was a liability when it came to being quiet, something she kinda reinforced in me too.

They should have gone back into town instead of going to the river, the world building was weak, the old man should have been a neighbor someone we knew about at least to give some connection. 

They also robbed a lot of easy tension building with that early scene on the bridge should have held back more and showed less or nothing.

That said, from the newspaper clippings in the beginning it seemed like a slow emergence (missing person posters galore) rather than an invasion so who knows?

>I feel like they would be much more safe in a LOUD place than in a quiet place

Why didn't they live near the waterfall or the river? Granted they probably went with the house they already had and adjusted their lives from there rather than construct a new abode but they could live a fairly normal existence near running water and be much safer. That or place wind chimes and bells everywhere and blast music as loud as you can all the time and let your neighbors do the same. I don't know how these things would be able to function in big cities. 

All that said, these are minor nitpicks for me at best. This was a phenomenal movie that had me at the edge of my seat the whole time and my girlfriend saw maybe half of it because she was too scared to look. I love that it was essentially a dialogue-free movie that conveyed everything it needed to through facial expressions and body language; it was very visual and tonal and played to the strengths of its medium.

If you want to nit pick those small items the second the alien puts his claw through the steel the kids are holding..  the kid wouldve been smoked right there.  no way they could hold steel up to that kind of strength to put a hole through it.

dxcgydh,"This brings us to Marcus, the roughly 13 yr oldish anxious child. We can infer that witnessing his brother’s violent death while he was all but incapacitated with a fever was enough to given him severe anxiety. The helplessness hurt his trust in his father who pushes him to take the necessary risks for survival. He is terrified and ambivalent even when in a perfectly safe circumstance. His cowardice causes him to go against the established protocol which was to wait at the location where he lit the fireworks until his father came to rescue him. Not only does his fear nearly get him killed several times, but it renders him virtually useless. When the old man is being murdered he covers his ears, the sound of the monsters sends him into to panic. The flaw comes back at the end where he cowers in a corner holding back sobs. This character is meant to be a foil to his sister; where she is perceived weak for her disability, the hearing her brother possesses actually makes him less of a contribution to his family unit. Unlike his sister is completely risk adverse, but ultimately that never helps his situation. He appears closer to his mother, no doubt because she’s warm and likely pampers him. More on that later. While he no doubt has a healthy relationship with his sister, there’s definitely tension because he’s not deaf. Despite being younger and less competent than his sister, he is given more freedom simply because he can hear. 

Next is Emily Blunt’s character. He cardinal traits are hope and guilt. Throughout the film she is seen doing everything she can to restore normalcy to their situation. She tells Regan her brother is okay when he’s clearly too feverish to even stand on his own. She initiates moments of intimacy, such as dancing and presumably sex, to maintain intimacy with her husband. She sends her daughter to gather the family for dinner as a gesture to maintain the family unit. She homeschools her children. She uses humor to keep a light mood. Her hope eventually becomes a flaw because whether by decision or negligence, she gets pregnant, something she wouldn’t do if she’d given up.

In response to 4:


They were hunting anything that made a noise that wasn’t background noise. 

The waterfall for example did not draw them in because it became background noise to them by that point. Its kind of like how, after living in a city for a while you start to tune out the cars and general noise of the street. You would probably still notice if an uncommon noise that was louder than the usual traffic occurred. 

When you live in a rural area the sound of crickets and birds become a sort of white noise and you pay no mind to it.

dx9z7z2,"My take on number 4 was that the monsters were listening for sounds that relate to humans. Things which are unnatural like the ticker or the the static on the tv. Instances where they kill things like the raccoon are from annoyance or otherwise coincidental.

He was young, but seemed old enough to understand the danger they were in.

I found there were a bunch of plot holes. The aliens have this super incredible hearing, but they can't hear people walking or running on the sand? And somehow near the end of the movie they got smarter or their hearing increased and they started coming in the house all the time. Also seems a bit of a stretch that with the entire power of the military no one figured out that they were sensitive to sound before.

dxa45lz,What about this: how were these the first people to stumble on the idea of blasting these monsters with a loud sound in order to confuse them and then shoot them? ,8a5qdo
dxa4dhc,">1) At the start of the movie, it was less than 3 months since the aliens came to earth and caused massacre. Then how come the town had no dead bodies or blood splatters anywhere. Surely many people would have been killed in the initial moments and there was no possibility of a clean-up crew to do anything.

B/c the writers aren't perfect.

No writer is perfect.

This was a mistake they made. 

They should've explained the lack of visible damage/carnage...or found another way around it, but this is a movie we're talking about.

Writers in movies/screenwriters can get away with more flaws if the actual film on screen LOOKS 'cool/good'. 

This was simply a mistake. 

>2) Why would the parents leave the youngest child unattended so many times even when he recently did a stupid thing (and who is most capable of doing something stupid)? They also leave him in the back of the line where no one can keep any eye on him. This was the weakest plot point for me.

B/c they needed to make tensions/create drama. 

Basically, they just needed to make an excuse to have some 'OMG FUCKKKKKK' moments right in the beginning.

Honestly, this is another mistake. 

Screenwriters tend to be more lazy when it comes to potential plotholes/realism stupidities since they know that they are writing for a VISUALLY-based entertainment medium and not one that's limited to what a reader can imagine in their own head. 

>3) Why take a trek to the pharmacy to get the meds and eat there only when needed? Why not get a small stock of necessary meds wrapped in a paper or cloth and keep at home with proper markings?

Another excuse to make a 'tension-filled' beginning.

They just needed an excuse to start the movie in some way/needed an excuse to kick things off with the 'right amount of tension'.

>4) We see that there were still some small animals present in the area. What happened to all the birds in the area? Just a bunch of birds making noise and flying away when the aliens came would have kept the aliens busy. Similarly noisy insects like crickets, cicadas etc.

Most likely another plot hole.

Writers/screenwriters/directors/producers/etc. are just simply LAZY.

Honestly, if you REALLYYYYYYY pay attention to most movies you'd actually notice how PATHETICALLY lazy and HILARIOUSLY incompetent most of the 'minds' in Hollywood are behind their so-called 'writing'. 

They just don't think things all the way through.

They sorta just start writing, but then instead of editing the actual UNIVERSE they created they either just go with it or they go back and do some GRAMMAR revisions and that's about it. 

But I will admit that this is the only one of the 4 questions here that might be a little more legitimate than the rest.

The others were clear examples of writer laziness.

A more 'realistic' answer would probably be something along the lines of:

Birds decided to fuck off and just say ""fuck this shit"" since birds actually adapt pretty quickly to regions with danger in them...well sorta...either way you'd be surprised at how 'smart' some animals may be. They learn pretty quickly to know which places to avoid if there's repeated patterns of danger there. 

Also, birds aren't really all that common in the first place...nor do they just constantly sit around chirping like retards for no good reason.

Just like us they have legitimate things to do too in order to survive. And sitting around pointlessly making noise like a moron isn't one of them. 

Plus, they really aren't as common as you might think.

Walk to your local forest preserve or do some camping in a relatively remote yet completely isolated area...it's not like there's constantly a fuckload of birds hollering at each other all the place. 

Also, the 'aliens' may well simply be JUST smart enough to know that they shouldn't target 'flying' creatures/prey. 

Just like how wolves (who use SCENT a lot) might not necessarily climb a tree for an eagle's eggs; so too would these guys may very well be 'programmed' to just simply know that things ABOVE them aren't worth it. 

Crickets really aren't all that loud...at all.

Honestly, the sound of human barefeet on gravel/sand from a human of average height, weight, build, etc. is probably about as loud as crickets are. Maybe louder.

The movie sure made that noise pretty noticeable. 

As for cicadas...you realize that they really only spawn once every like 11 or 17 years or something like that right?

Cicadas have a rather interesting lifespan.

A lot of chilling around as 'dormant' eggs and then all of a sudden BOOM here comes a FUCK load of them...then they die all by the end of the same summer they were born in. AFTER reproducing and laying a buncha eggs...and here we go again after some 11 or 17 or whatever years again. ",8a5qdo

Doors are also noisy. Maybe it's cold? but depends where they live.

Not sure if snow but it depends where they live. AFAIK they didn't tell us where they are. Probably rains but all that would do is maybe wipe out some of the sand paths they built.

dxl2rv8,"I'm almost 50 but have always loved movies with subplots and mysteries. I never like simplistic or preductable plotlines but most of my generation do because movies were more about being distracted or entertained. Most people my age don't want films to confuse them or make them look inward. Emotional films were only popular because my generation want to see relatable people-people just like them on screen but don't want films to challenge their perceptions or beliefs or present them with concepts that are difficult to comprehend. For instance: no one my age that I know liked 'LOST'. When answers weren't forthcoming or their guesses were wrong people gave up on the show. It was the most enjoyable show I had seen up to that point. 

I really wasn't interested in seeing 'A Quiet Place' because I figured it would be too simplistic or formulaic. I only saw it because it was generating so much interest. What was interesting was across the board people of all age groups seem to like this movie because the writing somehow manages to provide a predictable plotline, relatable characters and simplistic concepts but by not providing a lot of history or explanation of how the aliens arrived or any certainty about what was going to happen once the last 2 aliens reached the farm it satisfied younger people who are used to having puzzles presented to them with no guarantees of a wished for outcome. 

But this film will probably not become the new standard because studios have gotten used to big budget blockbusters or franchise reboots like Star Wars. Its sad because as screenwriters get more adventurous there's going to be a backlash from studios who don't mind the occasional outlier or gimmick but don't want to risk their fortunes on movies with weird plot devices or non-traditional filmmakers or in this case actor/writer/directors and small casts. Just my 2 cents.",8a5qdo

dwwabzr,"I understand the logic gaps with the Monster, but there are visible news paper articles / writing that says they have armor and that the armor is impenetrable to bullets / explosives. they also don't seem very containable so probably hard to trap.

I agree that someone would have figured out before it was too late that they are weakened by types of sound waves / feedback. Especially since there was enough time to figure out it was sound and print articles about it. I guess the movie is saying they found out too late that sound is even what sets them off. But yeah still something you have to look past. 

I feel like they did address the deaf girl's weakness though, the Dad doesn't want to take her along or bother training her because he knows she is a liability to everyone / herself when she is alone. 

And the whole having a kid thing, they want humanity to survive, they are going to need to figure out how to get by having kids or what's the point of even trying. I totally see how people can disagree with that, but I feel like this fairly religious couple would think that way.",8a5qdo

dxi56l0,Because the 'plot holes' seem really obvious. Still a good movie though.,8a5qdo
dxi8xgj,"There are a few reasons why I had serious issues with that side of this one. Number one, this movie took big steps to appear grounded in reality, took itself very seriously etc. This makes the huge unaddressed flaws in logic, ridiculous plot contrivances, in universe inconsistencies and bizarre character choices feel a lot more jarring than they would do in something like the Terminator or Tremors or whatever.

Number two- a BIG focus on the film was the in universe rules and how it all tied together, due to the lack of dialogue and lack of any real overarching plot progression for the majority of the film, most of the screen time went towards this...which again makes the glaring flaws in those rules and inconsistency feel extremely frustrating.

Number three we spend the whole time intimately with this very small group of characters and again with little overarching plot (till the very end) it's an unusually character focused film for it's genre....and this is a really good thing, one of the best things the movie has going for it actually...but when you then have those characters making weapons grade retarded choices, the likes of which you'd normally see in a shitty sci fi channel original movie it's again much harder to accept and suspend disbilief....if you're going to be character driven the script has got to do a better job with those characters.

Number 4, the visuals, the directing, the acting and the general concept are all really high quality...the script however is very poor, the quality of the other aspects leads you to expect more from the script and makes the issues with it much more noticeable. Also with such a great concept it's much more disappointing they didn't hire better qualified screenwriters.

And number 5, for me personally I saw the excellent reviews and being a big fan of post apocalyptic horror films and monster movies I was really excited and my partner and I rushed out to watch it in the cinema (first time going to the cinema in 2 years!!), we went in expecting something special but flaw after flaw kept coming up and we kept looking at each other and face palming each time... We had high expectations and spent quite a bit of money to see it at a fancy cinema...what we got was a 5/10 film that looked nice and was well directed but had a really poor script, not the 8/10 we were expecting. Each time a big problem reared its face I was internally thinking ''I cannot believe I just spent a bunch of money to watch this''. If I was just flicking through channels on a lazy Sunday evening at home and this came on I'd have been very pleasantly suprised and the flaws wouldn't have bothered me so much...this was however hyped up as like the new 28 days later or something, which it's just not.

It's not a bad film by any means and it's certainly above average for it's genre. It's directed well, acted well and has a great concept....overall despite all this I did like it, I'd give it a 5/10....but the actual script is dreadful (and if you take a look at the previous works of the writers of the film it's obvious why....all their other stuff is D grade trash a rejected pilot episodes for MTV shows)...It's just frustrating, this could have been great and I expected so much more.",8a5qdo
dxv3adf,"Well, I think the parents did have a good plan when the baby was soon going to come. They had a basement and a mini coffin (?) to put the baby in to nullify the noise. I do agree though, that having a baby was stupid in this scenario. At least they prepared beforehand?

>Also why do they live in a quiet farm house when they could live somewhere noisy like near a waterfall that would distract the monsters?

The waterfall isn't a very sustainable place to live. It's hard to sleep, weather problems, can't cook very well, many other problems. The family did a good job of sound proofing their home anyways. For example, putting grain on pathways to quiet their footsteps. Using sign language (either way, they had to learn it because of their deaf daughter). When the two kids were playing Monopoly, they were using some sort of plush toys instead of the metal pieces, as they know those make sound. ",8a5qdo

I'm not sure where I saw that, but I saw a show once which was making you think in a world of disaster, what are you ready to give up.

They might have. We don't really know. Maybe a lot of people did, but our protagonists are just finding out now. At the end of the day, this is the only story/universe we were presented. Everything else is not a fault in logic, is only open to interpretation or to fill the gaps yourself.

2. Just because we saw them figure it out late doesn’t mean everyone else didn’t.

>Nobody tried rotating sound frequencies? Even the military people and scientists living inside bunkers after a year and a half?

The monsters kill everything that makes a sound. No one had any reason to believe a certain frequency or sound would be a monsters weakness. This is a leap in logic.

We don't know for a fact sound is even a weakness. We see that the monsters have some kind of electro magnetic field that disrupts electronics. Maybe that effect was manipulated by the hearing aide. 

>Helicopters + snipers aiming at their ears?

The newspapers tell us their armour allows them to survive bombs. They only reveal their ears in extremely quiet settings to echolocate their prey. Helicopters are loud, alerting them without the use of their echolocation. 

>Now on to the family: they had a large and complex light system to turn red, but no button to turn on something that makes sound and send the monsters away? The monsters would destroy it when they got to it, but after waiting a couple of days they'd leave and the family could rebuild the system.

>Miraculous pin pointing upwards in a wooden stair setup earlier + water breaks at the perfect moment for a set piece with the creatures. Also, very pregnant woman carries a sack of potatoes up the stairs for no reason.

The nail placement is really weird.  it's just a nail for some reason.  I will agree to this however it wasn't a sack of potatoes.  It was their laundry.  When she fell and made that noise on the stairs bending the nail up potatoes would've went everywhere.  Either way.. Kind of trivial to aruge this point you have. I agree.  definitely needed something to led to another something.

>Old survivor puts fellow survivors in danger for NO REASON. Dude clearly wanted to kill himself but he had no reason to shout when he did. He could have just let them pass before. The reaction also wasn't a sudden reaction to the death of his wife. The shot establishes him just standing there over his dead wife for a solid minute ish, dead silent, before he screams.

I am going to put this one on psychological hands.  His wife looks like a relatively fresh kill.  he lost the one thing he loves and has nothing to lose.  why would he care about some guy and his kid?  This man and assuming in the mindset many of us find ourselves in when in emotional pain is sound to be screaming.  Lee's character acknowledges the guy is about to do something radical by giving him the silence gesture.  These cue's create the suppose and I can't say aren't hard to accept.

>Kid falls into grain store thing by plot magic & ""inconsistent grain physics"". (The latter did not bother me, but I found this whole sequence to be awful and contrived)

Have you ever been in deep grain?  I have trained on safety items in the agriculture field and demonstrated this many times.  the girl does go under a little quicker than normal, but the more you struggle the faster you go down.  if you are going to pick on the unrealistic grains and sinking I strongly suggest also making a fuss about the alien punching a hole in a metal door they kids are holding up to protect them from the alien.  I mean if one punch of that claw goes through metal those kids in that moment had some superhuman strength huh?  It's been to just accept the entire scene for it's value of entertainment.  I think it's worthless to complain about one thing unless you call it all out.  

>Another thing that annoyed me personally was the whole plot arc leading to Lee dying. This is PURELY my opinion and expectation from the story, but I just did not like this arc. It's not that it was terribly done, I just feel as though a more satisfactory ending could have been formulated with them all being alive.

you are right to opinion and for all things you said you are.. i'm just trying to through out some input and i'm happy to talk with you regarding it.  If anything up to this point has made it feel otherwise i apologize.  However, You're right this enter piece go could either way.  this is MY opinion.  I tend to like things going against the grain of traditional sole survivor or entire family survives idea.  Having Lee die I understand it, but you're right in that it's kind of a useless piece and he could live too.

>After the contrived grain sequence and subsequent escape, I don't understand why they didn't try to hide or make their way back to the safe house (soundproof basement) by food. They did not know it was flooded and it's been established that they can move and not alert the creature (see: basement water scene & Lee running in the sand in the beginning not getting him attacked). They chose this direction to have that sacrificial proclaimation of love, i get it. They even have some setup to it, yes. It doesn't make me feel any better about this arc though.

I somehow feel like they know they are still in a dangerous position and they did not want to have it possibly track their sounds back to the shelter in the barn.  I really don't have a rock solid explanation on this and i saw the movie twice. one for entertainment and second time for actual study and the whys.  It almost kind of seemed to me when he sent the kids to the truck he knew they were being tracked or setup.  This again is speculation though.  nothing was identified to support my thoughts.

>It also just eats at the back of my head that there is a possibility that they wanted emily blunt to be badass female lead (despite having no real setup towards this) at the end and killing Lee off was means of solidifying this. Not saying the ending is bad, I'm sure she knows how to use a shotgun in this kind of world. I'm just being a bitch because I didn't get the ending I was hoping for.

Honestly, this just sounds like your macho attitude getting in front of things.  The way this is worded makes me feel like you are strongly against woman as the tough girl etc.  You're right though the movie wraps with her cocking a shotgun.  I get where you see it, but you wrote it in a way i feel like there is a problem with this.  my only defense is that if i were a parent protecting my kids i'd be going duke nuke'em too.  so i'm actually okay with it, but the scene should've ended with her nodding with the shotgun.  cocking it just killed it.

either way great write up i enjoyed reading it and I hope you are willing to discuss things with me as well!

dxnjxe3,Great review. I agree with everything.,8a5qdo
dxnc0oc,"Holy shit are you me?

I had the same issues, especially with the forced scene of Lee's death. To go even further, I think the characters in the film were all really flat, and the only one I really connected with was Lee (who I didn't know the name of until you said it)

I loved the portrayal of the relationships, especially between the parents. They both gave wonderful performances, and the scene where they were dancing was probably my favorite in the whole movie. I also enjoyed the way the film's direction gave the feeling of being hunted whenever the characters were feeling anxious, then would switch to really close and personal shots so you could really see the fear on their faces. The acting overall was great, although there were some moments where the child actors weren't too great. I've been spoiled by It when it comes to child actors.

So that's most of what I enjoyed, which is why I think it's a solid 7/10. It's a well-executed movie with a lot of tense moments.

But holy shit did those plot holes and devices bug me. You pointed out a bunch of them, but I would add that the characters themselves often felt like they were plot devices themselves. The mother is the worst example of this since she spent basically the whole movie as pregnant. Then literally hours after giving birth, she's running around with ease. 

I don't think it was a bad movie, but it wasn't a 10/10 by any means. My friends always get mad at me for ""hating"" every movie I see, but it's usually that I just notice bullshit and it annoys me, pulling me out of the experience. I never said it was bad, but when I vocalized my issues everyone just kind of shrugged it off or agreed while still praising the movie.

Maybe I'm just too harsh a critic.",8a5qdo

dxxceqf,"My issue wasn't even that complicated. My biggest pet peeve in the movie was:

A stairwell full of picture frames. Any one of which, if accidentally bumped and knocked off, would hit the ground, break glass, and then fall down the stairs. I've known about this problem for all of 1 hour watching the movie, and I already figured out that ANY household item which could break needs to be immediately gotten rid of.

Also, why don't they have noise-makers more conveniently located to distract and pull the monsters away from their home? A few remote devices would have literally saved their lives. They clearly have enough tech to build and maintain a complex video and radio system.

My roommate was absolutely losing his shit over the nail. That's NOT HOW YOU PUT NAILS INTO THINGS! WHY WAS IT STICKING *UP*WARD?",8a5qdo
dxx85vf,"- I mean, the point is made that they are almost supernaturally resilient, although I would find it more believable that they know the area by now, as they appear to be able to navigate the house, meaning they have been in the house prior.

- The map seemed to indicate they are closer than that, but again, it may well be they are familiar with their hunting grounds.

- That would require building, wouldn't it? Building is loud, shouting might not attract them but I feel like hammers might, if you didn't notice it appears everyone is living on abandoned property judging by the fire signals and only other people encountered. Living riverside has disadvantages, especially in stormy weather, and how close would they have to be to be truly masked? They're also far from their grains, and surrounded by trees, so protective layouts would be difficult, and with roots there could be no digging of any kind, also too loud.

- Radios don't use sound, they use radiation.

- They do, that appears to be how they were almost killed repeatedly, the creatures could hear them in very close proximity.

- Probably because they'd knock them over, which you might recall happened, the better question is why isn't everything at waist height on a surface? As far as more shelving, again, building things is loud.

- That's a good question, they would be hooked up to the electric grid of course, but how is electricity being generated? Generating electricity is loud, even without people to do it that would mean the creatures would be drawn there and destroy it, except for maybe a hydroelectric dam, which they could not destroy.

- That's also a good one, their refusal to use distractions until things are dire appears to just be not wanting to rouse the creatures and have them stalking the area, also, they THINK there are only three in the area, but a sufficiently loud source could draw many, many more.

- Where was it said they did that?

- They were, the father stopped them, it had already easily crushed the roof.

- Their creators are likely blind, I gather, we create things in our own image, including weapons.",8a5qdo
dxxchhw,"THANK YOU.

Where’d they get all the sand to make, presumably, MILES of pathways between the farm and the store at day 89? And how did they expand them? Sand is not something most farms have in that amount.

Also, what about the mom ripping her robe walking up the stairs and thinking “oh this sound is fine, I’ll just tear my robe?” But how is her robe strong enough to pull up a bent nail?! I’ve never owned a robe that could do something like that

Maybe the first shot should have just bounced off until the noise came on again then the combo worked.  That's simple and it makes sense.

dx0lqlx,"> Why yell and get the monster to him

The monster supposedly heard the shovel hit the ground, but yeah he totally had to yell to distract them. Which by the way the monster would have heard the truck and Jim's death would have given them 30 seconds of safety.

Overall I totally agree with your initial assessment. It's a great horror movie, but it's not a great movie. It relies on too many questionable or unintentionally comical decisions by it's characters to create drama and conflict that plagues horror movies. It's a great horror film, but I think the movie (and many viewers) were expecting more. It's worth watching because of the premise and the great use of sound, but it's not an all-time great movie like people were making it out to be.

He yelled because he had a been gut like a fucking fish and he knew he was going to die. Not sure why this is such a sticking point with everyone. Humans be dramatic, yo.

They set up earlier in the film soundproofing that basement room. Presumably they would raise the child and train it to be silent. Honestly it would probably be easier than getting their other kids to adapt to a soundless environment - it would grow up knowing only the whispers of its parents and siblings. Pretty spooky. Of course fuck that now because Mama Blunt's done and gone the Varmint hunting. 

I honestly was expecting people to instead complain about them realizing that the earpiece was what drove them off. All the girl knew was that her head fucking hurt, and then nothing came to get her.

After what happened to the brother, we can see how there has been some kind of deep resentment growing between the daughter and the dad. From the dining scene where she's reluctant to be the one to 'call' him for dinner to him refusing to bring her out to teach her things. What we're probably not shown is the number of times this must have happened; where he refuses to talk to her or see her. I think the bit where the brother asks why he doesn't bring her out; it's not the first time he's had to go out alone with the dad. But since it's the first time he gets to speak normally to him, he decides to ask the dad then. If I'm not wrong, the dad never really acknowledges her the whole time, not when he grabs her away from the stairs, not when they argue about the listening tool (he's patronizing then and she knows it) and even after the kids escape the barn, he only hugs the song. It was only up until the moment he finally realizes he's about to die that he's able to shed the resentment he had completely and tells her he loves her. So why did he stop her from going down to the room? He loves her, but he can't face that part of it because of the resentment he bears towards her. It's built up to a point where there's probably some kind of pride involved. Again I'm not explaining this so well but that's how I see it.

dxzobuy,"I wouldn't say I loved it but did enjoy the first ""action"" scene. When the kid was playing and everyone turns around except the hearing impaired girl. The sound difference in that scene was pretty intense. She was scared by the looks on their faces. You hear nothing when on her and then noise...silence...noise and then the worst silence. The descion to let the kid have his toy was innocent to her. In that moment she saw why it wasn't and will be haunted by it more than them.

I share your inquiry of how intelligent the family is suppose to be portrayed. Dad can make hearing aides, wire lights, cameras and fish. He didnt think of cutting the wires on the toy or removing the speakers? Trying to raise a quiet family is hard enough. Now you have to it or you won't survive a walk. Using the sand to walk on and quiet the leaves was smart. The nail scene was irritating. Was waiting for the bag to rip open, dramatic music as the contents loudly roll down the steps. Queue slow motion of the vegetables bouncing and her scared/shocked face watching them fall. How quiet was their coitus? Think about killing the creatures before having another baby.

Didn't they think of camping near the river to raise their family? She has a water birth and is drowned out by the waterfall. Might could build a shelter with minimal noise. Set up trip wires to lure the creatures to their death. Have a tree crush them, a trap door with sharp objects below or put a string on a shotgun trigger.

Idk I liked the concept of trying to survive in a quiet world. I probably wouldn't want to move at all. During the day would be safer but still dangerous. People have those ""blank"" moments when they make a noise because it wouldn't have gotten them killed before. Getting my hands on some type of decibel meter would help greatly.",8a5qdo
dxzk0pt,"I don't think you should be downvoted for your opinion. The movie hits a few things square on the head. First, props for originality. Second, I loved the family interactions; the entirety of the cast showed great chemistry (I'm sure it helps that the two leads are married IRL), and the movie had shown a very honest light on the family. Third, I loved the contrast between our main family and the old man that murder-suicided (maybe you felt like his wife died of natural causes, and he was just ""done""; I didn't get that vibe at all, though). It's really a contrast between the misanthropic nihilism of a man at the end of his rope, and the illogical, unending hope for humanity displayed by the protagonist; we're shown two arguments here, and the movie makes a strong case for humanity. The great thing about all of this, is that it abides perfectly to the rule ""show, don't tell."" 

A more controversial opinion I have, is that we should look at what sets the movie apart: this movie is an unabashed non-politically correct take on family, and it turns out that a ton of people notice that and appreciate it. I mean, when is the last time we saw a movie or show where the central focus is the importance of the father doing what a father does? Now, Emily Blunt's role isn't marginalized in any way here, but I think what sets the movie apart is the depiction of a father. Maybe it has to do with me being a father to a young boy myself, but *I felt* like the movie accurately depicted what I view as my most important job, something I feel like I see less and less from Hollywood.

He was four.  Four year-old kids are still developing an understanding of the consequences of their actions.  Seeing as he's alive, he likely hasn't had a full on run-in with the creatures yet.  As for the traveling ahead, I also thought it was strange but chalked it up to the parents being preoccupied/distracted.

e1vjiwd,"Yup, this should be the top voted comment (albeit there are some explanations to your plot holes but I wouldn't even bother calling out which ones) in this thread...you win ",8a5qdo
e1x3151," It should be voted pretentious and idiotic, not best comment. Most of these, however ridiculous, make sense. The only one truly good is the heartbeat one.

1. They were weeks in the apocalypse, the kids were told everything they needed to know and they knew how dangerous was everything. More so, they UNDERSTOOD how dangerous sounds were because they didn't have any problems until that point. Every kid behaved carefully. The father left batteries there assuming that, as in the case of everything else, the kid would have understood that he couldn't take the toy. The kid, albeit young, understood until her sister decided to give him the plane, at which he considered if its alright to take a plane that his father forbade him, then maybe its not that dangerous to take batteries too. IF THE SISTER wouldn't have given him the plane, the kid wouldn't have taken it. A child that age behaved well enough, listening to the authority.
2. The father knows he needs specialized hardware, but unlike you, he also realizes he lives in a post-apocalyptic world where he NEEDS to make due because he has a deaf daughter in a world where your life depends on how much sound you make. What would you do? Kill the girl? She could walk in a branch anytime or worse, something around her might make sound without her even realizing and she'd end up dead. He tried for months and was still trying because this is not one of those situations where you can go on without.
3. Sound is not only thing that matters. A fire, a river, even a bug, make constant noise, so constant our brains manage to block it making us seem we can't hear it. Someone living in a big city can partially block traffic sound that kills a visitor from countryside. Creatures that hunt on sound should be able to distinguish repetitive sound and ignore it, else they'd be like moths on a bulb at everything dead that makes a noise. Sudden sound gets their attention, makes them inspect, that is why they are attracted by things like frames falling and fireworks.
4. You clearly have never been to a waterfall, especially big ones. You need to shout to be understood by the one near you. The only inconsistency there was that the father and son heard each other by whispering. I've been to a similar sized waterfall and had to shout in my friend's ear to be understood, and I was standing at a distance, not IN the waterfall like the people in the movie.
5. Old man was a cynical idiot with a broken heart. He didn't shout only out of pain, but mainly because he WANTED to commit suicide. People do dumb things like that all the time, like when they commit suicide by driving their cars into trees when they have innocent passengers with them. He was literally broken and did not give a damn about the lucky father who still had family.
6. "" Walking up and down a completely wooden and very old staircase that never once creaks or makes sound "". Really? Do people nowadays really watch movies with their arses? They painted the ENTIRE FLOOR, including STAIRS, so that they know where they should and shouldn't step. Watch the movie again. There are rectangular marks all over and more than once you see characters jumping from one to another. They did so to know what place on that wood DOESN'T MAKE A SOUND. As an example, she might have even not hit the nail if that nail wasn't on the walking mark. Watch the movie again, you deserve a failing grade.
7. "" Kid runs through corn stalks instead of between them so he can make as much noise as possible. "" A KID. FEARING FOR HIS DEATH. He didn't think. Remember 9/11? People jumped OUT OF THE WINDOW. Did they think it was a good idea? No, they didn't think anything because when panic gets you, you do what your instinct tells you. AND THOSE PEOPLE ON 9/11 WERE NOT KIDS, either.
8. "" Kids camp out on top of an old creaky corn silo instead of walking back to their house. The daughter didn't care about spending the night on a bridge out in the open, what is their deal now? "" The kid went alone to the bridge because she knew she was smart and careful enough not to get killed, even though her father doubted that. I, as a child, once defied my parents and went way forward and way faster, alone, on a trail in the middle of the mountain. Though a child, I knew I had the best navigation instincts so I couldn't get lost, and I was also very careful on the dangerous trail. Of course it was a dumb decision, but it ended well because, as with the girl, and I knew my limits. Now, when she was on the silo was a different thing: SHE KNEW they were in danger so she NEEDED TO DO AS INSTRUCTED. It was not a ""I can be careful it''s alright"" situation. It was a ""monsters are close-by. I need to do as instructed so I keep myself and my brother safe and I don't also endanger my father who could be looking for us"" situation.
9. "" -kid conveniently shuts off hearing aide so the creature isn't affected and can kill her father. "" Conveniently because WE, THE VIEWERS, know that the creature was scared off by the sounds. She didn't know that. Up until that point she was way farther from the creature or she didn't even know the creature was around. Now, that creature was right above them, waiting to kill them, her father was possibly dead, and she had interference in her ear that was distracting her massively and could potentially get her killed. However annoying, it was the best decision at that time.
10. "" -Creature doesn't hear kids moving around in corn when they are directly beneath it. "" It heard well enough, but it couldn't pinpoint it at millimeter because: They kids weren't making noise on their own exact position, they were making noise around them. As they were getting deeper, the corn around them started to fall and bury them. Imagine you are taking a bath and then when you're done, you take the bath plug. There is a line of water all over the bath tub except where the drain is, where a whirlwind is forming and moving. The whirlwind was the one making the sound, while right at the center, causing it, were the kids. The kids were being dragged down but that didn't cause a sound, the sound was caused by the hole they were making being covered by falling corn from around them. Makes sense?
11. "" Literally the only failsafe this family has is fireworks when a remote speaker making loud noises away from the home would have been a better plan. For that matter ANYTHING would have been a better plan. "" We don't know all of their failsafes, but a speaker would have been a very bad idea. It is a post-apocalyptic world, there is no government standing to maintain and deliver energy. Wherever they have energy from, be it a generator or whatever, it's used by the radio and tv screens inside their home. Even as lights they had oil lanterns and normal lanterns instead of electrical bulbs. 

Other points were answered here already, maybe even most of them, I haven't read the entire thread. It grinds my gears not only for this movie, but many, when people watch it god knows how and then complain there are inconsistencies that are not. Yes, some of these seem only ridiculous ways to advance the plot and that might annoy you and other critics to such a degree you disregard common sense explanations, but I assure you, they are not that off.

I only just got done seeing the movie for the first time and thought it was fantastic, but I did take issue with some things. The newspaper clippings establish that 1) prior to the complete collapse of civilization they became aware that the creatures hunted by sound and 2) the military, seemingly, couldn't hurt them.

I think that, logically, if the military is aware they hunt by sound (which the universe establishes they are/were), then the military would also focus on sounds to ""fight"" them.

2) If they were literally every 100 or maybe even 20 feet as in zombie films it'd also convince me more of the tension of never being able to make a noise.

dxkuvqg,">fuck's sake, our military has an arsenal of sonic weapons developed for ""crowd control"" and offensive uses that would have made wiping these things out a matter of fact

Its not just sound. It was the particular feedback from the hearing aids that caused the reaction otherwise gunfire alone should be enough to cripple them. A ""cacophony of sound that keep these creatures forever off-balance"" wouldnt put them off balance anymore than the military firing dozens of automatic/semi automatic weapons simultaneously would. It had to be the specific feedback. They could be distracted with fireworks, but they werent crippled like they were when exposed to the feedback sound thing.

>Yes, they included a shot of a newspaper headline that weakly addressed this glaring plot hole by proclaiming the creatures were resistant to bullets and bombs, but really? 

Because they are alien. They could have an organic carbon nanotube based exoskin. We have no idea. A bunker buster could work, but how many of them are there? We are seeing them in the random country side, probably on the lower end of the density spectrum. But if a billion of the fucks were dropped on earth its a very different story.

How do you poison something alien, how do you test what is poisonous? What if the atmosphere is already poisonous and reduces their overall lifespan from 300 years to 40 years. But as an alien bioweapon that breeds at the age of 2 years, its utterly irrelevant.

The acting is good and the sound design is good but the plot was full of holes, or logical inconsistencies, and it didn't really have a story to tell. It felt like most of what happens in the film was there just to scare you. Like what was the purpose of them running into that old man in the woods? He didn't further the plot at all, he didn't serve as a major obstacle for them to overcome, he was just there to scare you. 
I didn't hate the movie or anything but I really don't understand why people are saying it's amazing and the scariest movie in years. For me it really lacked a lot of elements required to tell a great story. It just leaned on the premise of monsters kill you if they hear you and didn't do anything else with it. I'm rambling. I could go on for awhile about all the issues I have with this film. It's by no means a terrible movie, it just didn't do anything for me. ",8a5qdo

dwz6w1s,"Well, to be fair about the weakness, he wasn’t able to contact anyone else. To shoot them in the mouth, you have to literally attract them, have their mouth open and not chomping on you and then shoot accurately. Without making much noise leading up to it. The noise/frequency generation thing might be a bit hard to stumble upon if your first instinct is to shoot and then learn to be quiet. As far as setting something further away, I think it might be a bit of a supplies issue or actually setting it up? But really there are other issues like clean flowing water in the pipes and electricity. Both of which make tons of noise to process and generate. Also, what happened to the son and he needed his medicine? Why didn’t they just bring it with them so they wouldn’t have to go to town? Wouldn’t they need more medicine? How were they able to harvest safely? Sure, the fish would help but I doubt that the fields would so lush and large since you’d need to effectively hoe the land, deweed it. This all produces a lot of sound. So there definitely are issues. But if you don’t think too deeply and ignore the details like you said it’s a good film. 

As far as the baby goes, no one asks to get pregnant. Its easy to presume they had some sex and happened to have a baby. Without a safe way to do a c section, I’m going to guess they decided to bring it to term. The dad isn’t a doctor, likely a mechanic or electrical engineer before this. ",8a5qdo

Humans have historically proven time and again that they're very bad at keeping it in their pants. As an example, just look at many children the poverty stricken people in Africa have, even though they and their children are on the brink of starvation, if not already dying or dead.
Also, with a woman like Emily Blunt, even I too wouldn't be able to keep it in, lol.

    How have they made it 400+ days into this and they're best preparations/failsafes are turning some lights red and having a single rocket set up somewhere?

400+ days since the monsters arrived. I'm sure there would have been several months of public panic, before they settled down the way they did.

After they did settle down, they also setup...

* Soft sand on wherever they walked.
* A whole radio system, setup from scavenged parts, to contact someone in the government who could help.
* The sound-proof room.
* Scavenging several lights and wires to set up the lights.
* A farm.
* etc.

All of which was done VERY VERY quietly.

I think they did pretty well.

Also, John Krasinski isn't an MacGyver. He did pretty well.

    The guy is clearly smart, he was making or at least adjusting hearing aids for his daughter

He has no idea what the fuck he's doing. It's a small, simple, electric device and he's just figuring it out as he goes along... and failing every time.

    why they wouldn't set up SOMETHING to make noise a bit farther away
What the hell do you think those rockets were for?

And just noise isn't enough. The monsters weren't attacking the waterfall or the river even though they're noisy. It needs to be a noise that stands out, that isn't natural, and would be made by a living creature.

Are you asking why couldn't he have set up a remote-control speaker that would move around and make random noises so attract the monsters? Again... he isn't MacGyver.

    Their overall weakness that lets them kill them... is just high frequency/loud sounds...and being shot. Again I dont get how they'd make it 400 days into this and not have at least some clue about that.

Given how powerful (it tore through a fucking tank), bullet-proof (this fact was mentioned in the notes in the communication room. The only time they're not bulletproof is when their face is exposed), fast and in extremely huge numbers these creatures are (wherever you are, if you make a noise, they're on you within seconds)... I think most people died out before anyone even realized that they can only detect you if you make a noise, and by then only small batches of humans were left.

Hell, given the mindless fear and panic that humans are capable of... I'm surprised that they even had the presence of mind to managed to figure out the ""detect through sound thing"", as everyone they know and love, are being killed left, right, and center, along with the rest of the world, and it looks like the end of times. In such a dire situation, many people had the presence of mind to figure that out, and communicate it to so many small groups of people spread around the farm, is an achievement, I'd say.

Finally, by the time someone did finally have a clue about the effect of high-frequency sounds, the government and communications were all down, so there's no way to tell the whole world about it.",8a5qdo

People who are not terribly logical in the moment: 

* Parents grieving the death of a child,

* Loving spouses who want to demonstrate their affection,

* Horny, attractive adults

Combine that with the issue of birth control. Assuming they even used it, assuming they could even *find* any, most or all forms of contraception lose effectiveness over time.

I agree with the inconsistency points, but for what it was, in the world they lived in, I guess it kind of made sense. Lack of time, resources, and maybe plain just not thinking ahead like that.

They can have a modern--albeit silent--quality of life in their house, have the ability to work on hearing aids and planning for future events (baby's birth etc), **or** they can 
 live as nomads near a river. What a tough choice. 

>always live in an underground bunker?

What underground bunker? What type quality of life are you expecting from an underground bunker anyway?

>Just go out for some food?

Are they pooping inside this non-existing underground bunker?

>There is absolutely no way I could believe that Emily Blunt just made a baby pop out of her with the creature right there not hearing shit. 

There is absolutely no way you missed the fireworks. 

>Why the fuck would you have a kid? 

They are who they are.  

>The kid is a automatic death sentence for it and the family (unless you follow the thought of living underground or near the waterfall).

They had a well thought out plan. They even had a makeshift ""underground"" room.

>Why do they always motion everyone to be quiet when that is their whole existence? Like no shit be quiet...always be quiet

So you find it a 'logical disturbance' that parents et al. spend ten percent of a calorie moving their finger to their fucking mouth in grave danger? That's an incredibly stupid thought and one that doesn't even begin to conform to reality where parents remind their children day in day out to do mundane things like put on a coat when it's damp outside.

These criticisms aren't reasonable. 

>But the main gripe of this movie that I have is that I can not believe that humans couldn't figure out a way that radio frequency fucks up these creatures so badly.

What is the purpose of just making shit up?

Radio frequencies? What? What had did you pull that out of?

These creatures are established to be supernatural, armored, straight invincible - **except** temporarily their heads are made vulnerable by extreme audio feedback. 

It would take one incredible coincidence for one of the creatures to experience that **and** then be shot in the head in its now vulnerable state. In fact it would be incredibly unlikely for them to be getting shot at at all after millions of ammunition had already been fired at them to no avail. 

>There are 6 billion people in this world and no one can figure out how to beat creatures that can only hunt with sound?

This isn't a video game. You don't respawn. You don't get to test out your theories. You see the stuff of nightmares, it is invincible, you die shortly afterwards as you're screaming or otherwise making a ton of noise without thinking about it. 


>If 1 shotgun shot kills 1 of these things than the army would absolutely destroy these creatures.

Noise traps can be noisey and might not be something they want to risk making because this seems like something they've never experienced before. They've been relatively safe up until this point.

I think if the characters were written to be rural corn farmers it makes sense they wouldn't necessarily have the resources to create such an ideal situation.

> A line of dialogue. ""We can't stay too long, I've seen them come here at night to drink"".

I think this would hurt the overall continuity of the monster's behavior. It seemed the creatures weren't attracted to noise so much as they hate noise and are trying to stamp things that make noise. The problem is that you can't murder river until it's silent. It makes more sense they would avoid the running water altogether.

> electricity takes generators (LOUD), or city power. If the city has people working at the power plant... then why aren't you going there???

Yeah, that's a good point. You make a good suggestion too.

> If loud sounds can be used to lure creatures away from smaller ones... then why don't you have loud sounds playing further away all the time. Like a air raid siren, any mosque or church has loud speakers and bells, even wind chimes everywhere, attach some junk to a windmill.

You also make a good point here, and I like your suggestion. While I do think the film gives the audience enough to infer why they aren't constantly setting sound traps, your suggestion sounds like it would've been a really compelling visual sequence that could've added to the film.

problem 1: They had limited underground space and they used it for the most noise guy - a newborn, their main home was pretty soundproof (no noisy items, no plates, no cutlery etc.)

problem 2: building and making no sound is impossible, camping is also not possible nor convenient. how would you gather supplies away from noisy waterfall and make no noise

problem 3: that one i can agree with, as a compromise they might have it underground so they are ""forced"" to live overground

problem 4: because then it becomes another waterfall and they just ignore it, as a distraction one-off mechanism they used loud fireworks

problem 5: kids are in shock, not thinking straight (they are kids, man, cmon, since the VERY FIRST SCENE OF A MOVIE a kid fucks up and gets killed) ",8a5qdo

2. How do you know they have carpentry experience? How are they going to get the supplies And tools necessary to build a large shelter or bunker? Do you propose they just waltz down the the lumber yard to get the materials and then magically transport it all without making noise? 

3. You need to be 'shown' solar panels in order to satisfy your own need to know how they have electricity, the movie doesn't have to do that in order for it to be feasible, there fore that's a personal nitpick, nothing more. 

4. Sound traps will do nothing but get destroyed. Could they have had more of them besides fire works, yes, but they will eventually get destroyed And you have now drawn the creatures close to your proximity. How does that make things better?

Young children being notoriously noisy and bordering on suicidal at the best of times, it just seems like a hugely unnecessary risk to their whole family. Birth control might not have been the easiest thing to come by around there but they seemed a pretty resourceful couple and could surely have figured something out with either contraception or abortion (harsh though that sounds), given the obvious death sentence a baby would bring upon their remaining 2 children.
This particularly seemed odd given the mother's lines about ''what are we if we can't even protect our children?''...if you can't protect a 6 year old in this world...if you acknowledge you couldn't do that...why are you having a baby? Good luck protecting a toddler! Their older daughter started a fire in their home that nearly took them all out, their younger son got himself killed and almost the whole family....why on earth would they think a baby was a good idea?

dxo3fmh,"We see a wall covered in missing person's fliers. I think this suggests the monsters initially avoid crowds and just picked off stragglers. We can infer the aliens were massacring people so methodically that by the time anyone was even aware there was a problem a lot of damage was done. People lucky enough to live in geographically isolated urban cities (namely NYC) would get to remain in the city under quarantine, which implies at least some degree of safety, but there's no confirmation locking down worked. People out in the cuts and the heartland were left to fend for themselves. 

I'm sure the first thing they realized about the monsters is that their armor is resistant to all of their guns and artillery and that their claws slice through metal like butter. It was probably a blood bath before the continent was quiet enough to establish the noise seeking pattern the monsters had. Even if they realized the creatures primarily depend on hearing, it doesn't follow that anyone would think to use a sound weapon, or that sound was even the weakness to begin with. It seems to me the monster's weakness has more to do with its electro magnetic field running feedback through a malfunctioning hearing aide. No one hears the feedback except the wearer of the hearing aide. I'm also sure the EMF effected the military's weaponry. If the weakness is just a really high frequency sound then it's conceivable the frequency is beyond what humans build technology to match, much less comprehend. It would be very Lovecraftian.

None of this is even to mention the effect on the world a meteoritic impact would have. It's likely the entire nation of Mexico is destroyed. This would be the single largest humanitarian effort of all of human history. They might send the military equipped strictly for search and rescue only to be ambushed by the newly arrived aliens. Maybe that ambush capitalized on avoiding small groups initially thus stalling more intense military action.

All and all I think this film gave the viewer enough info to fill in the blanks. It lets the audience use their imagination which made for a more satisfying viewing experience.

[1. Opening scene: Regan is shown doting on her little brother, Beau, enabling him even though he's breaking their rules (catches the rocket ship that endangers them but still lets him keep it). She loves her family even amid this trying time. Her giving him the rocket ship attracts the monsters, and **Lee risks his life trying to catch Beau, but doesn't get there fast enough**.](#spoiler)

[2. Dinner scene: Regan refuses her mom's request to bring her father to dinner. She's still willing to communicate with the rest of the family, but not her father. **Perhaps she hates her father for failing to save her brother?**](#spoiler)

[3. Basement scene with Lee: We see that Lee is spending at least some of his time trying to make Regan a hearing aid so she'll be in less danger, even though he's having to teach himself how to do it. **Obviously he loves all of his kids**.](#spoiler)

[4. Basement scene with Regan: Lee admonishes Regan not to go down into the basement for unknown reasons. He then gives her a new hearing aid that doesn't work. She chastises him that they never work. **So far, these line up with adolescent rebellion, albeit in a particularly trying circumstance, but there might be something there we don't yet know.**](#spoiler)

[5. Before the hunt: Regan, being the oldest, wants to go with Lee, who refuses. **She storms off, feeling ineffectual because she feels out of control of her life.** Recognizing this, Lee says ""next time.""](#spoiler)

[6. Waterfall scene: Marcus reveals to Lee that Regan blames herself for Beau's death, and Lee steadfastly denies that she is to blame, reiterating how much he loves all of his children and it was no one's fault. **In fact, who's to blame for Beau's death is arguably the central emotional conflict of the story, with each character blaming themselves.**](#spoiler)

[7. Atop the silo, Marcus reveals the truth to Regan, **who still doesn't believe it**. Therefore...](#spoiler)

[8. **Lee sacrifices himself after being mortally wounded to save his children, just like he promised Evelyn he would.**](#spoiler)

dwyv6ld,"I'm not a CI user, but a bilateral BTE hearing aid user.  It's unbelievably easy to throw my hearing aids into a feedback loop, which was my perception of what the creatures caused to happen to the girl's CI.  You're right about the mechanics of how a cochlear implant receives and processes sound to its user, but all of the receiving is done externally through a microphone.  All you really have to do to cause feedback is to block the pathway enough that the microphone is filtering back into itself.  Someone with more technical and mechanical competency can undoubtedly explain this better, but from my end I can say with full confidence that sometimes all it takes to set my hearing aids off is for me to rest my head in my hands, or lean my cheek on someone's shoulder.  If I turn them on before I put them in, simply holding them in my hand will cause the feedback.

It seemed clear that there's something in the creatures' biochemistry that messes with certain waves: lights flicker and diminish in their presence, and the girl's CI enters a feedback loop due to their proximity.  The dad had already done the work to amplify the external processor, and it's a known truth that the more powerful the hearing aid or implant, the more likely it is to be set off by feedback.  She wouldn't have needed it to be connected to her head to send it into a feedback loop as far as I know.  As long as it was on, she could have done the same thing by clutching it in her closed fist.

You gotta start stuffing a rag in your kid’s mouth and slapping them around until they submit fully. I never thought I’d say such a thing, but this is survival... their survival. 

Okay, you mentioned these, but let me vent:

-	I’m sure it would have just been too difficult to build a shelter near the waterfall. It would have been a terrible place for your wife to give birth. Also, why not use the river to get where you need to go? Maybe they were afraid of water. 
-	A fucking baby?!?!

All of that being said, if the storytelling and the character development would have been better, these plot holes might not have been so offensive. 

I quickly found myself cheering for the aliens and praying for the slaughter of a family. Why did you do this to me John Krasinski?

After the tenth time of rolling my eyes so hard that I had to adjust myself in my seat, I seriously almost left.

dxak1j9,"Kinda unfair. First off, I’d love to discuss some of the plot holes you think there were. I have a few but I think they’re minor and can be argued against. 

Secondly, one of the major themes of the film was sacrifice, especially parental sacrifice. After the opening scene, did you not think “hmmm, what it the father would’ve yelled and likely Cassie’s the alien to change course, thereby possibly saving his son and sacrificing himself?” Do you think this thought probably ran through the *character’s* mind at all during the year that passes? Don’t you think he probably had guilt, that things could be different, and his son could be alive if he would’ve just taken the death for him? Were you honestly surprised that this theme came up again at the end of the film, resolving that problem? 

And how in any way did this film have a “slow, careful build?” This movie was unbelievably intense after the first scene, to a degree that I have yet to find a movie that matches. I’m not saying that this makes it better than all other horror or thriller movies, I’m simply stating that every other horror or thriller movie that I’ve ever seen has at least *some* moments of relief. Not this film. Every single second was intense. There was no relief, which I suspect is the reason the film was only 90 minutes long, as they would wear audiences out if they carried that on for 2 hours or more. 

The film’s tone never provided a relief of tension. At any second, a character to make an *extremely* minor mistake and attract the bringers of their death in an instant. They were in constant peril every moment. It wasn’t even safe for them to whisper. How was that a slow build? Knock over a lamp? There are deadly creatures crawling all over your house. A raccoon makes a chirp? Dead. There was constant, intense danger established with the unflinching first death of the film. I’m sorry, but I don’t agree even in the slightest that the film was slow or careful. 

The movie starts off with you feeling like “oh my God why would you even want to live in a world like this? Just end it for yourself.” And by the time the characters were in active and immediate danger towards the start of the 3rd act, you were pleading that all of these people survive. Not wanting them to die never felt forced. 

The ending felt natural. The family had been searching for a way to deal with this threat and was absolutely determined when they finally found one. ",8a5qdo

dx440si,"I think many of your questions are valid, reddit just downvotes so dont take it personally. But I want to add my, whatever counts as my opinion/explanation, to this topic and maybe add some more questions. 

- Based on the end of the film the creatures seem to congregate on their dead comrades. That scene where all the creatures are running towards their barn at the end before the 'shotgun pump badass mess'em up line'. 

- Probably just go to the last area with sound, and then use their new proximity to hear smaller, quieter sounds, honing in on the target. 

- I agree, it seems a loudspeaker blaring with some soldiers in gun nests in the area would make some quick work of these. We do have pretty damn loud sound emitting devices now...anyway, I'm assuming the response to this is that by the time it was learned it was too late to utilize this technique. Oh and maybe the armor thing, maybe it is impossible to effectively hurt these things until their face is spread apart from that one frequency...Again, dont we have devices that can make a very loud noise of scaling frequencies?....whatever.

- Maybe dad wanted the daughter to not know he was working so hard on her gift...thinking she would say it isnt worth it....I dont know. 

- Underside of carpet is pretty rough, dont think it would feel nice on your feet. But, why would you not add more throw rugs, and or carpet. Or, why not try to find an abandoned newer house that doesnt have creeky ass old house floorboards. If there was a movie explanation to this, then I missed it, but I know there could be viewer/redditor explanations of their actions. 

- I would agree, trying to live near naturally made noise, something that doesnt seem to attract the creatures, would be a good idea. I'm assuming living near something like that would be annoying, super noisy all the time...seems worth it. 

- The fires must be other people...going all LOR style texting. 

- The movie didnt explain this...Maybe there was some religion reason they couldn't abort or use contraceptives and still had sex, they did pray that one dinner scene. It isnt unimaginable, just really really not helpful. 

Now for my extra questions:

- Why did the guy yell with people around?...he hadn't yelled yet, was he waiting for other people so he could take them down with him or something. I get the whole commuting suicide idea, but why would he want to hurt others from his pain....emotions, but damn.

- Did the girl not have enough evidence that her hearing aid was correlative to creatures by the truck being torn apart scene? I never saw her hearing aid make a noise or give her feedback unless nearby scary creature (in the silo, or in a corn field near the families 'danger near red light array')...

- Wouldn't the creature fall don't into the corn of the silo just as fast, if not faster then the kids did? It seems pretty heavy, slim, and moving around a bunch. From my perspective it just seemed to get around unimpeded, like it had a firm footing. 

Anyway, I liked the film. I usually dont mind finding, and then discussing loopholes to sci fi films. It only detracts if it is egregious, otherwise I think it is fun to entrench my thoughts in the fictional universe, even if it has issues with the way I would respond 'in the real world'",8a5qdo
dx490di,"> If there were 3 creatures in the area as the board said,Why not make 3 noises and just shoot them?

They are initially bulletproof. (White board says ""armor""). I believe the high-pitch sound made them killable. 

> Do they only go to the specific spot of noise as per the old man and child? If so why did they hang around the house so long in the last part of the movie?

I think they're just hunting. With the first two, it was obvious because they were out in the open making loud continuous sounds. But with the others, they were inside or had only made one sound. So it wasn't easy to tell where they were. 

> Surely if they know they are noise related creatures then a sound weapon would be obvious?

Agreed. Surely somebody in a populated area would have figured it out. 

> Why wouldnt he let the girl go downstairs?

Good question. 

> Why not live on a boat near the noisy water?

Another good question. 

> What are the fires lit everynight?

They are to let the other farmers/homesteads know that everything was alright with them.

The girl avoided stepping onto dry leaves and they didn't use shoes - so the monsters can tell a difference between a branch falling off a tree and a person stepping onto a dry leaf in a house far away? Or the monsters attack plants every time wind blows in the forest?

If the monsters were blind, how did they avoid trees? If they can detect a tree, why cannot they detect a human?

If the monsters had so great hearing to hear small noises from few hundred meters, why couldn't they hear heartbeat or heavy breathing from 3m distance?

There were still racoons, which are annoying noisy creatures. How did they survive 450 days with these things nearby? You are telling me a racoon is better at staying quiet than a human? 

If someone made a noise and they know the monsters heard it, why didn't they like move quietly 5 meters in any direction? Monsters apparently remember from where the noise was made, but they can't hear you if you just stand there.

Why didn't they think of using a ropes and bells to lure monsters away?

The monsters can hear shattered glass from few kilometers away, but they can't hear you if you are near waterfall. Why don't they live there?

They follow any sound they recently heard, how the hell did they outplay entire human race? It's even dumber than human race getting almost wiped out in The Walking Dead.

Why don't they just stay in the soundproof room all the time?

2. Yes, he was seeing how many other people were left during the apocalypse (?). That way when it showed the children trying to signal out, [it showed that they were completely alone.](#spoiler)

3. It could have been a certain frequency or combination of wavelengths that caused it. Maybe the military attempted to fight back with firepower and it caused more mayhem on there end. That is a really good question though. 

4. Maybe he knew just distracting them wouldn't give them enough time for either of them to get away. 

5. This... is a really good question. I don't think I can come up with an answer for this one. ",8a5qdo
dwychzz,"Just got back from watching the film.  I'll take a stab at these with my thoughts:

1. I'm not a parent, and this feels like a question that's probably better left to one.  Obviously the children are well aware of their circumstance -- they live with it every day, and it colors every aspect of their lives.  They've all seen firsthand just how dangerous the creatures are.  Still, it strikes me that this was born of a desire to be protective.  My reading of it was that he didn't want his child to see the full scope of what was going on.  The basement was were they kept all the information they'd amassed.  It contained everything they knew.  I imagine the father wanted to do everything in his power to keep his daughter from understanding the full weight of what was happening.  If he could feed her enough information that he felt would keep her safe, that was ideal.  What do parents do in situations where they need children to understand the gravity of something, but don't want to overwhelm them with the full reality?

2. That was my take, yes.

3. If I'm not wrong, the creatures are emitting frequencies that react to both light and sound on some level.  This is shown in the flickering of the light bulbs when they're around, and also in the fact that the girl's cochlear implant doesn't emit a feedback sound unless she's in close proximity to them.  You'd think an organized military force that determined the creatures hunt by sound would use it as a combative deterrent, but what's unique here is the interplay between cochlear implant technology and the creatures' biochemistry.  I'm hard of hearing, so I'll readily admit that I watched his movie with a disability bias: my reading of it is slanted by my experience, and my absolute desire to see that reflected positively onscreen.  There's no question in my mind that this was a willful decision to give the Deaf character a heroic arc and to elevate her perceived disability to a position of power above what able-bodied people are intended to achieve.  I understand the majority of the population might want to say that it's bullshit and the military should have been able to find out that winning combination before it got so far, but for me I appreciated the hell out of this.  I can suspend my disbelief well enough to read into it that the circumstances of the interplay between CI and creature were so rare that no one had the opportunity to think in that direction before it was too late.

4. His wounds were pretty significant so he might've known that he was already a goner.  But obviously more than anything it was for dramatic impact.  John Krasinski has called this movie a ""love letter to his children,"" so I think it's one of those things the audience is just supposed to accept as the ultimate parental sacrifice.  Probably would make a bigger impact on a parent.

5. The old man's wife wasn't eaten, and the creature made no attempt to eat the father after it had slashed him.  I didn't think about this during the movie, but I really like your thinking here.  Really curious premise.",8a5qdo

I know obviously the father had no way of knowing it by that point but the fact that the audience did made that scene just seem silly to myself and my partner....seemed a bizarre oversight on the part of the script.

Father unnecessarily dramatically sacrifices himself for his daughter who actually would've been fine anyway, I don't think dramatic irony was the tone they were going for so it just felt very off to me. Especially since less then 10 minutes later they all get trapped in the basement with one anyway and she uses it to kill the creature, further reinforcing how silly the sacrifice was. Reminded me a little bit of that final scene in The Mist....except in the Mist it was clearly intended to be an ''oh fuck that was totally pointless'' joke, played with very thick black comedy....and at least in the mist when the sacrifice was being made the audience wasn't aware it was for nothing until a few minutes later so the initial impact was still there. In quiet place I just rolled my eyes hard....just a really forced parental sacrifice moment.

We don't know how old the newspapers shown are, or what is happening in rest of the world outside of their story. It's possible that the US government / military figured out how to kill these monsters, they could have been working toward eradicating them on a large scale even. If there were a large number of the creatures from the beginning they could have made a huge blow that left the country in shambles, and a year later someone could have figured out the key to killing them but still be in the process of getting all that information distributed and then executing a large scale counter-attack.

He could make complicated electronic stuff yet he could not ignite the fireworks from his house, yet he used all the electricity and wires on all those expensive light bulbs, and sent his boy to ignite the fireworks with... a fucking lighter? Seriously? And forget the fireworks, why didn't he just put some speakers on top of the tank? He had all those fucking speakers down his basements and he had to use the fireworks, Jesus? Why the kids insisted on leaving the tank, what is wrong with staying on top of the tank that night and went home the next morning? Instead of walking through the corn field during the night? Why didn't the baby cry more, have they ever seen a real new born baby? They cry ALL THE TIME, let alone in a damp, wet, hot place, without his mom's breats. Why the sister need to leave the house and visit his brother's grave and lie there until midnight, does she have common sense or not? Why they had so many SHELVES everywhere in the house?

dead kid not getting sound, I dunno I came in late to theater and missed this part. 

Corn, didn't they have a piece of door or wood or something they were using to ""float"" on?

Why would you have a kid. This is the biggest question a lot of people have brought up and there is some validity to it.

Live in the underground bunker. Because its important to learn how to live in this world and not just shelter yourself. If you can learn to be quiet you dont have to live in a dark basement your whole life.

Did they LET the daughter roam around? Or did they just trust her enough to not keep their eyes on her 24/7?

The waterfall was hours removed from their home, as well as any reliable source of food. Their daughter is deaf, meaning she would never know how far she can stray from the waterfall to take a piss before the sound of her footsteps gets her killed.

The creatures are likely intelligent enough to know that the huge explosions in the sky aren't prey, but the noise is loud enough to mask the families movement.
3. Speakers is an interesting idea. The creatures can definitely distinguish the sounds of prey vs ambient noise (hence why they don't shred every rusty door or rustling leaf or waterfall) so if you played like waterfall noises or something it may be convincing enough.

dy46reu,"Not everyone makes sound when they get jump scared, I certainly don't, I just jump. Whilst there are people like you that do make noise the film takes place months after the monsters have arrived, anyone that makes noise when jump scared will have died a long time ago. Given this the family are unlikely to be people that make noise when they jump, and since they are a family they'll also know this and so won't be too worried about making each other jump. You can say that's exceptional, but given how few people seem to still be alive you'd have to be exceptional to have survived for so long.

The raccoons are why the earlier noise didn't bring the monster into the house, the monster only knows that a noise was made, it doesn't know who made it. Since it found a raccoon it assumes that the raccoon must have been what made the noise so once it was dead and no further noises were made the monster assumed there wasn't anything else left to kill. I'll grant you that it doesn't make much sense that the raccoon hadn't already been killed on the first week.

How are the monsters easy to catch? They can rip through grain silos, whilst it had more trouble with the truck it was causing damage so it probably would be able to rip up the steel roof given more time. Given no animals in real life can do that it's unlikely they have a cage built to withstand that kind of power, so they'd have to build one. To construct such a thing though you'd have to make a lot of noise, so the monsters would come and kill you before you could make one. You'd need to make sure it was soundproof too, otherwise odds are other monsters are going to hear it trying to escape and come to investigate.

Edit: Even if they did somehow catch one though and get it into a soundproof room the sound at first appears only to stun them, there's no logical reason to assume that it would also make their armour weaker, and it would be a very brave man that would open the cage to shoot it (since you aren't going to be able to shoot through the impenetrable cage) knowing that if bullets still don't work the monster is going to kill him.",8a5qdo

The only excuse was if that apocalyse happened after she got pregnant but it didn't appear that way. They already had three kids though. They were irresponsible parents from the get go.

They should have had an abortion obviously because a crying baby would obviously end up attracting the monsters killing them all, two little kids to feed and look after was already a lot, and the world they lived was one of constant fear not much joy. 

They seemed like too smart of a couple to make such an obviously stupid mistake. They were at a pharmacy that should have had over the counter plan B or condoms. 

Also why would the hearing aid start screeching whenever there was a monster near by and stop. Two of the times it happened she wasn't even aware a monster was near by I think. Then she magically makes the connection at the end. Jim also said something like ""it worked"" which sounded almost as if he was referring to the hearing aid. I don't understand how the creature wasn't able to hear them after the baby was born when it was right above it.

dxgykbl,"I don't think any of these criticisms are valid

>1. So the *real* way to defeat these monsters is as easy as a shotgun blast to the face? Seems pretty ridiculous that no military on the planet could figure out that these blind monsters just sprint over to the nearest loud noise, open up their faces and are easily murked with a shotgun. Set up a few boomboxes, play some Motley Crue and rocket launch those fucks when they mosey on over.

The monster's armour withstands bombs. They were able to survive a trip on a meteorite through the atmosphere which would burn up anything on earth. The shotgun worked because the monster exposed its soft tissue. There's no reason to suggest noise had anything to do with it seeing as how the monster's presence is what caused the feedback. It clearly effects all the electronics we see it share screentime with. Maybe it's more electro magnetic than anything. 

All of that is beyond the point. That's like asking how the Xenomorphs cut the power to the base in Aliens. Does that really need to be explained?

Given that meteoritic impacts have a tendency to cause extinction events, and given that the aliens survive bombs and guns, and that they kill everything that makes a noise, it's not that hard to conceive of the premise of this film. You'd need to ignore many facts to cast doubt. 

They would just break a boom box. There's also nowhere to buy a boom box in the apocalypse.

That's definitely not how rockets work.

>2. Seems equally ridiculous that with all the technology our planet has it wouldn't be a first option to try to nullify these monsters with a wide spectrum of frequencies.

Who would think to do that without reading the script? The only thing they know if that they can't shoot the aliens and they kill anything above ground that makes noise. The movie doesn't even confirm that sound is really the weakness. 

>3. How brutally irresponsible is it to have a baby in this environment!? You're looting a CVS for antibiotics or whatever and you can't grab a couple boxes of Trojans? 

It's very irresponsible. How is that a plot hole? It doesn't break logic or continuity. There's a clear motivation for the pregnancy. 

Interesting characters make mistakes all the time. It's what separates them from Mary Sues. If you want a movie where characters do everything perfectly and there are no consequences for their mistakes stick to Disney or Marvel. 

>4. Is the father trying to cure deafness? I didn't understand this at all. A hearing aide wouldn't work because she's completely deaf right? maybe I'm just ignorant of this but seemed like a huge waste of time given the circumstances.  Maybe focus on building the motley crue boom box system and locating some shotguns.

Being deaf is a severe handicap in a world where making noise gets you killed. That father's top priority was to protect his children. There's no reason to believe she was completely deaf, only that Lee doesn't know how to build a hearing aide.

Again. Booms boxes break. They also usually need to be activated manually. So basically you're suggesting people just play music to tell the monster where they are. Earlier you suggested luring them onto a rocket, but I assumed you were kidding.

You could argue they could build some kind of PA system, and I would ask you where they would get the skills or resources to do any of that?

>5. When the father finally sacrficies himself to save his kids.... did he really have to scream!? Just throw the damn axe against the shed. It'll make a big ol' noise and that dumbass blind monster will just scramble over there. *WTF* ...then roll your ass down the hill with the kids.

He was bleeding out with ribs sticking out of his chest. If he created a diversion that didn't get him killed he'd risk his kids trying to rescue him at their own peril. He was keeping a promise to his wife.

Again this isn't a plot hole. There's a clear explanation for his action and motivation and logic and continuity are preserved.

>6. Why not live in like a concrete building??? You really have to live in the creakiest old, wooden house on the planet? Seems like you should just build a structure by the waterfall at the very least, since you can scream and talk your ass off right next to it with no repercussions.

Ok, who's going to build it? 

Nothing you've listed here meets the definition of a plot hole. A plot hole is something that breaks logic or continuity. Like one *real* plot hole is how those racoons survived so long, or why they slam the doors to the truck when they're running from the monster. Those are actual plot holes. All of your gripes have pretty simple answers. 

It's one thing to say you didn't like something about a movie, and that's just your opinion. But if you're claiming what you listed above are holes in the plot then that claim is false.

She shouldn't have to be perfect.  (And that's the whole point of the follow-up from the opening sequence: yes, she made a stupid and bad decision.  But she's a kid, you should forgive her.)

I think these movies are built around the very idea that humans have limitations.

People in horror movies make bad decisions, and it gets them in trouble . . . just like the rest of us.",8a5qdo

dwzfoel,"1. We don't know the whole situation, maybe other people have done that so there weren't a lot of fireworks left and only enough to have the distraction set up reliably as opposed to possibly failing to kill with the use of explosives. Basically, we really don't know much about the availability of resources needed to reliably make those.

2. I thought that too, hell when they started flooding I thought they were REALLY close to the river but apparently not. But once again, we don't know how they even got there as we don't know the full situation of how the creatures even got there. It might've been where they already lived before the whole situation started and so they didn't fully want to move? I really have no answer for that.

3. I don't think they got busy right after since the death was on Day 89 iirc. The movie then continues to day 470 something so that's more than a year. Less the 9 months that would bring the conception to about day 196 according to Google, in which case that would be 107 days after the death of their kid. Now grieving varies so I'm not sure if 107 days is not enough for some. So your point there may stand depending on the person. I think you're right though, I would have thought maybe a year after before getting busy would make the most sense LOL

4. I believe that's what they started to do at the end. I'm just as surprised that the dad didn't figure out the radio frequency hurting considering the amount of research he's done on human ears. Only defense I can think of for that is that he was so focused on studying human ears for his daughter that he was unable to apply the knowledge on the creatures

5. I didn't really see any sailboats throughout the movie. Idk the location but making a sailboat would have been a large investment for them which just brings us back to the whole not knowing the entire situation.

Yeah agreed, they really had a lot more ways to survive but as you saw through the movie, it only takes one mistake to cause you your survival anyway LOL I'm still surprised the door in the silo didn't kill either of them.

dx2082e,"I don't know about that, it was interesting that they seemed to effect electricity and it showed they were emitting a sound frequency of their own. The premise was that the microphone on the hearing aid was modified to exaggerate high frequency sound as a last ditch effort to get her to hear something. The combined effect of the creatures electrical manipulation with a device that simultaneously took and amplified high frequencies that the creatures had turned out to be emitting, is what caused them to become incapacitated. It's also some rural town cut off from the world, who knows what its like elsewhere.

So I don't think that's a poorly written plot hole. 

If I were to think of a plot hole, its that power was still a thing. These creatures should have easily been tricked by an array of speakers to keep them busy over large areas or loured into traps. At the very least, that man was capable of making an emergency device that triggered a speaker off property.

In the first half of the movie it seemed that perhaps they moved so quickly that there was no way for infantry to fight them effectively. Second half shows that isn't true: the things creep around slowly, and a well-trained platoon could take them down in short order, because humans actually have them at a disadvantage most of the time. (Humans regularly know where the aliens are while the aliens don't know where the humans are.) Line up your shot and take it.

The girl may have worked out what to do, but how many people are gonna be playing a high pitched noise when they know that sound = death. She probably isn't the first to work it out.

They lost their kid and were grieving. They probably weren't thinking ahead about it they just wanted something to help make the pain go away. They aren't perfect

- The house? I dunno, it's post-apocalypse, you need itinerary or something? You're asking where they got...sand, hoo boy. Living near waterfalls is pretty abysmal, also, you're building a house over there Tim The Toolman Taylor? Good idea. Probably because you can't live in a basement, I've tried. The creature smashed the pipe, it was a lot of water. The baby is a McGuffin, true, but I mean they did have their last boy brutally murdered. Uhm, it...it didn't, there was an entire scene where one of the nails used in the staircase gets caught on her bag and pulled up, wow. I assume because the creature would come back, they seem to do that when roused, and, indeed, it came back after the kids in spite of his sacrifice.

- You really didn't pay attention to anything, huh? The sound didn't weaken it, the sound destroyed its sensory muscles, and all that armor was now gone, flesh exposed, meaning no armor, meaning no armor protection, meaning bang bang shooty hurt hurt.

dxw979s,"First off, the military appears to have been quite successful. There are only 3 in the area that the family explores. I'm assuming that's because after a large war numbers on both sides dwindled. We aren't ever told the number of the invading force, but that's what I choose to believe.

The old guy is someone that I bet they knew, or at least the dad did. The beacons being lit clearly is a sign of community in some sense. But his wife had been killed for some reason so he was just giving up.

I do agree with you about the waterfall and soundproof basement. It seems they could have set themselves up a little better to handle the situation, but I guess we can leave that to ineptitude of the characters and not necessarily the writers. Remember they are flawed humans that probably wanted to stay near their home.

The baby is dumb, but again, dumb humans makes it plausible. 

The nail came from her tugging on the laundry bag and pulling the nail up. She should have known better, but it was explained.

The dad sacrifices himself because it's a movie and it's dramatic. I totally bought into it in the moment. I don't feel the need to explain this, sometimes movies do things just so you'll feel something.

The final scene with the creature getting shot can be debated. What you've said is your opinion on it and that's fine. I don't see any potential plot holes there. It's just how this movie chose to resolve the issue and I thought it landed pretty well.

Creature design is another opinion thing, no need to debate. I don't think they were super memorable but they served their purpose.

To your final point, it would be interesting to see other people in the situation, but then you're changing the whole movie. Then it becomes The Walking Dead and not a movie focused on a single family's struggle. What this movie did so well was get you invested in the family and it's internal squabbles and make you care what happened. That would have been tough to do if you start introducing more characters.

Eating a bag of chips is very noisy.  Even trying to pick up and carry a bag of chips makes noise.  In a world where noise = death, I'd be leaving those chips right where they are.

The raccoons don't make enough noise to attract the aliens from far away, so they get by making their occasional little sounds.  But when [the big noise in the house attracts the aliens to the general area, those little raccoon noises are noticeable, and they get killed.](#spoiler)

>interesting that the daughter knew which wire to cut to stop the noise on the rocket

The dad got the multi-tool for her, and she was super excited about it.  I think it's implied that she has been into tinkering with things like that for a while.  She's probably around 12 years old in the movie, and it starts on like day 89 or something.  So she likely had a few years of experience with stuff like that before all hell broke loose, so it's not hard to believe she can tell which wire connects to a speaker, and which connect to lights.  I also assume that the dad was into electronics (maybe an engineer before?) because of all the tinkering he did, and maybe the daughter got it from him, which is why she [wanted to go down into the basement so much and was very upset that she couldn't.](#spoiler)  This was perhaps something they used to do together as a bonding hobby, and now she couldn't.  This feeds on her feelings of being left out like when [the boy goes off with the dad, and she has to stay behind.](#spoiler)  But I'm just speculating about this part and could be way off.

[Although the creature design is similar to other creatures we've seen before. Also I agree about the weakness. We already have weapons like that developed and other similar tools for crowd control.

EDIT:  She shot it without high frequency to kill it however it's head shell thing was still vunerable.  i'm willing to bet this allowed the kill shot.

I understand what you are saying, but I saw it from that perspective.  I also found the papers from the press interesting... however, maybe those things bred.  maybe it spread over the course of time etc.  I'm willing to overlook some of the things you identified because I don't think that just assuming the military can fix the problem is good enough.  If we all as viewers viewed things this way why even make a movie about it?",8a5qdo
dxo2y8a,"I agree the monster was poorly executed. Not just in the design, but in the overall execution. They showed it way too early and we see it so often that by the end of the movie it ceases to be scary. The situations it creates were tense and immersive, but the monster itself wasn't at all scary.

I disagree with your points about how killing the monster breaks the film's premise. Given the newspaper clippings and the missing person's fliers I think it's safe to infer that the aliens landed in Mexico and relatively quickly spread outward. They have armour that withstands bombs (not to mention the heat of entering the atmosphere without a shuttle), has claws that slice through metal like butter, and display particular aggression toward anything that makes a noise. Likely as aliens arrived in new communities they would pick off stragglers rather than revealing themselves to large groups (thus the wall of missing person's fliers). Large urban areas with feasible geography (like NYC) quarantine themselves from the outside world, and the rural heart lands we see in the film are very much forced to survive on their own. 

Inevitably the military gets involved, but this is a new enemy impervious to all of their weapons and there's really no reason to believe the military realized sound (or EMF manipulation) was a factor until the damage was already done. Other people have mentioned that they occasionally reveal their inner ear, but that seems to only happen when they are tracking something very quiet. There's room to infer that the military simply couldn't exploit that weakness during combat. Even if they were to kill one, the shot fired would give their position away to any others in the vicinity. 

I also think it's worth mentioning that these aliens arrived because of a meteorite. The entire country of Mexico is probably devastated from the impact alone. It's possible the military was sent in to provide aide only to be ambushed by the aliens.

I don't think it's worth thinking too deep into the lore and backstory of this movie. It was clearly more interested in evoking an experience of tension more than it was trying to establish a new monster cinematic universe. 

I too would give the movie a 6.5-7/10, but none of my criticisms are actually with the script. I just thought that it's a movie that doesn't have much rewatchability. It depends so much on the tension of the situation that once you know what happens and how everything resolves the rest of the movie isn't really interesting enough to promote repeated viewings. This movie is kind of like Dunkirk in that it's a breath taking cinematic viewing experience, but it's kind of just alright film. I am however looking forward to the director's future projects.

It falls down and the sister catches it before it can make a sound. Before they leave, the dad sees the rocket and takes it, then removes the batteries. He explains to his son (in sign) that the toy is too loud. They leave the rocket there, and the family heads out.

Youngest kid and daughter linger behind. The daughter gives her brother the rocket back, then leaves. Brother then leaves, but grabs the batteries on his way out. This is why he had the rocket that caused him to get snatched up. Also why the sister blames herself. ",8a5qdo

dx2llty,"I'm fairly certain that was his wife and he was incredibly upset that he lost her and wanted to die. I like your idea but let's consider the opening sequence where John's son dies when he activates the space ship toy: John was RIGHT there and the creature only kills his son -- the creatures only seem to seek out and destroy the actual source of the sound. 

If his hope was to narc on other humans I think he would do something to make *them* make a sound, as opposed to screaming himself and then not even trying to run away.

But again, interesting idea, though!",8a5qdo
dx2mfvm,"No, looked like they might have got his wife/family so it was suicide by monster. You see them kill him. The old man just wanted to die. If anything he was trying to save them by becoming a distraction? That's what gave Lee the idea at the end of the movie.",8a5qdo

dwy9ruj,"average. Definitely doesn't deserve the high RT score.  I'd give it a 65-70%

Nothing groundbreaking, story-wise. Lots of stupid decisions by the characters is the only thing fueling the events",8a5qdo

I gotta say, your concept of 'tad different' sounds pretty commonplace in film. Woman dying resulting in Roaring Rampage of Romance is basic AF. 

",8a5qdo
dx2lg91,glad you didnt write it wouldve been too cliche mainstream movie ,8a5qdo
dx2hce6,"It actually wasn't a hearing aid - it was a cochlear implant... and, therefore, this whole part of the movie makes no sense because a cochlear implant does NOT emit audible sound.",8a5qdo
dx2tidz,Those other fires were other survivors. They didn't actually show them because the story wasn't about the other survivors. It was enough to show that there were still other people who are alive in this world for world building. ,8a5qdo
dx46ugd,I strongly believe that this movie is *meant* to be enjoyed in a theater setting. Otherwise you'll miss out on subtle things like the switches in sound quality from character to character to emphasize that you're hearing things from their perspective.,8a5qdo
dx4640b,I think it was a really good theater experience. Totally worth it ,8a5qdo
dx46ky9,"Go watch it, you probably don't want to eat during the film though lol. Another tip, go during the weekday and before 5pm.",8a5qdo
dx4r348,"I suggest in theaters. In a bit. Emptier the better.

Personally didn't like the very ending but the whole movie experience was great. Tense and suspenseful.",8a5qdo
dx46d9c,risk? it was good,8a5qdo
dx4m7te,"I'm so torn on this question. It benefits and hurts from the the theater experience.

The ""big"" aspect of the theater, with large screen and amazing sound system is definitely a plus. But the movie is so silent, you hear tons of ambient noise. I didn't even have anyone talking in my theatre, and people were generally trying to be quiet. But you still hear food eating, soda drinking, feet shuffling, jackets rubbing, etc.",8a5qdo
dx4t2k6,"it's worth the theater experience, a big, quiet, (seemingly) empty space really compliments the movie",8a5qdo
dx59pko,See an early screening. I know these sorts of films are usually great late night viewing experiences but you'll just get loads of people being inconsiderate. I saw it today at a 10:05AM screening. There were 6 people in the cinema (including us) and it was dead silent throughout. Thoroughly enjoyed it. ,8a5qdo
dx46o0q,"Worth it, just don't expect it to live up to the massive RT ratings.",8a5qdo
dx4ucy0,An old man kept munching popcorn for over an hour right behind me so... just plan accordingly to avoid inconsiderate people.,8a5qdo
dx6b4nj,There's no way in hell they added scenes while the film was already in theaters.,8a5qdo
dx7kgu6,"Saw the movie opening night and again yesterday, can confirm the scene was definitely there both times.",8a5qdo
dx97xoq,"Looks like they had rudimentary echolocation, too.",8a5qdo
dx94qnw,"Based on what I saw, they run to the area and then open their head to ""pin point"" sounds to find whatever made the noise.  They also are shown to walk around to inspect the general area (the monster walks around upstairs before going down into the basement).",8a5qdo
dx8zemz,I got a sense like they still knew that something was there and if u made a sounds they would look for you in the area. They get around this with the kid early on but just having the monster jump across the road as if the monster just assumed it was only the kid and kept going. ,8a5qdo
dxa8m7k,"I saw a bit of the demogorgan in the look of the monster, especially when its face expanded. ",8a5qdo
dximk1l,"There was someone on the floor who was dead. I assumed he was related to the old man in someway. Since this person died, im guessing the old man had nothing left to live for and just decided to say fuck it and die.",8a5qdo
dxkunlw,There is a womans corpse which we can assume his wife so... out of grief or mental instability perhaps?,8a5qdo
dxjpimx,Possibly mentally insane?,8a5qdo
dxti393,Well I think the point is she couldn’t which is why they set up the distraction,8a5qdo
dxumhmo,She did have three others prior. I think she had some idea of how much pain chlldbirth would be for her.,8a5qdo
dww5dxl,"My theory is that the monsters had thick protective skin usually, so it could withstand a normal hit/bullet/etc. When the sound freaked it out, it's head plates were opened and so when she shot it, it wasn't protected anymore. ",8a5qdo
dww6mfp,"I'm pretty sure the sound frequency caused the alien to ""open up"" which left it vulnerable to a shotgun becasue otherwise they had armor skin. ",8a5qdo
dww5lif,"The sound seemed to remove the armor, the shotgun killed it.",8a5qdo
dww3cma,"the bullet was the killer, the sound cause the creature pain and stuff but it was still kicking until the mom shot it. which to me, means that with all the creatures coming at them in the end, they probably didn't make it",8a5qdo
dww60ov,"i got the idea that the sound weakened them a bit - the weird armour-skin was the most opened up at that point, so it allowed the shot to actually do damage, since the armour is seemingly impenetrable. so neither one their own would be enough",8a5qdo
dww6i6m,That was the beginning of the movie. There was no explanation prior.,8a5qdo
dwy1qw1,"You didn't even miss 5 min. That's basically where it started we don't get an intro, they just throw you in at day 89. ",8a5qdo
dww6r1i,"They don't explain the creature's origins, and the details of how/where they came from. It's all left up to interpretation (aside from that they have a really strong sense of hearing and are blind).

Much better that we don't know anything.",8a5qdo
dww7yp8,After the film ended I couldnt get up from my seat without making a noise. Props for lasting 480ish days,8a5qdo
dwwblnw,"My guess is he recently came across his dead wife, or maybe he was just standing there for a while over her corpse, and either went crazy or just wanted to die, so he screamed. I don't think it was malicious, I don't think he wanted to harm the main characters.",8a5qdo
dwwma14,"It looked like his wife was killed by one of the monsters. He was planning on letting a monster take him out by yelling. 

What a dick though, he couldn’t wait until the father/son passed by first? ",8a5qdo
dwwai2i,I took it as they heard the sound from the shotgun going off. ,8a5qdo
dwwa4w3,"That was exactly what I was thinking! The monsters attacked 15 months before and they would’ve had to have fucked after the youngest had died. Plus, they didn’t even build anything soundproof until it was almost time for her to deliver.",8a5qdo
dwwc1ht,"Aren't there already created frequencies that can mess with dogs ears that we can't hear? 

Oh and Emily Blunt was the smallest 9 month pregnant woman I have ever seen",8a5qdo
dwwcxfo,"I was so afraid my audience would be disruptive! It was packed full of teenagers, but when the film began it was completely silent throughout the entire film and I appreciated that so much! It was the polar opposite to the audience I saw *It Comes At Night* with which was loud and obnoxious! They laughed and screamed the whole time acting like they were watching *The Bye Bye Man* or something. That still ended up being my favorite film of 2017, though, so it all worked out in the end!",8a5qdo

dwwn30m,"I think the first one is one of those things that you think is a 'plot hole' type of thing, but once you think about it you'll realise that there is nothing much they can do other than take comfort that there are others out there too. It is definitely much safer to operate as a group of small people. It would be really hard to communicate effectively with a complete stranger without making any sound. New members can potentially cause disruption too, which is definitely not something anyone wants. 

It's like... each group manages to survive for that long, do they really want to put it at risk by inviting strangers, whose behaviors and habits they don't know anything about, into their group? If that new person turns out to be allergic to something in their house and sneeze, they are all going to die.

I found it dumber that the child insisted on putting the batteries in the toy. I mean, he clearly knows the dangers of talking and making noises, so why not play with it without batteries? 

The waterfall makes sense to be honest. it would take alot of work and a ton of noise in order to build a new shelter, and the monsters would have stopped them. Sure talking may be okay, but building takes alot more noise and work and it's not worth the risk. Also it seemed like they also relied on the farm for food too.

Noise making machinery would be destroyed pretty fast, as evident by the monster going off on the timer. it seems like natural noises like waterfalls are just not possible for them to stop, so they probably just leave them alone. One thing that did bother me is why did they not set up noise distractions away from their house, like a speaker somewhere not that far away? if ever a monster got too close or was attacking, they could activate it and pull them away. Also, seeing as they had the fireworks set up, they atleast had this idea too. why not continue it rather than just one thing? 

It looked like they were trying to do the noise reduction, with the paper mache, but i suppose it was a bigger priority to deal with food issues and setting up surveillance?  

Anchoring would mean they would have to return every now and then for food of medical resources. Also we don't know where the movie is set so they could be far away from a big lake or ocean, and have no way of getting there (a car would get stopped pretty quickly).

dx63ng9,"Some holes in your holes:

- kid in last: you have a point there, although with eldest son being sick and having to be carried i can see there being lapses of judgment.

- moving and building has a HIGH chance of making too much noise. Sure, once you get all of the materials to the waterfall to build you might be ok, but how do you transport all of those materials safely? How do you get the lumber etc required without making noise? Also, this is a post-apocalyptic situation...living on a farm gives them innumerable life-sustaining benefits aside from the sound thing.

- what happens when you build and first set up this machinery? You’re not going to make any noise doing it, and once it starts making noise you dont think the monsters will immediately rip you up?

- they could have soundproofed their house more, but see prior point about living on the farm being advantageous. Where are you getting this ship btw, seeing as there were no signs of them being by the ocean, and long-distance travel makes noise? And how are you operating it noiselessly? And how do you survive anchored in the middle of nowhere?

- the monster’s head ONLY became vulnerable when it “opened up” due to the hearing aid noise interference. You could clearly see that in the character design, the head was usually armored but after the noise issues it was exposed, almost like a video game boss showing its weak spot. I thought this was pretty explicit.

- it wasnt just “some loud noise” that messed with the monster, it was that exact frequency, and they were armored otherwise. While enough isolated artillery could probably take it out despite the armor, it’s not like the military knew how these things operated until they were already decimated. The efficiency with which these monsters killed anything making noise makes it seem like there’d be a LOT of chaos and death at the start, and once the military got the idea idk how they make this superstructure without making noise.

dx6424t,"The creatures had some type of armor shell. Its weakness was the high-frequency interference that stunned it and  made the armor open up all the way, leaving it vulnerable. That is why the ''simple shotgun shot'' worked in the end.

The ship idea is not a horrible one, though the setup might be risky. Ships are not exactly quiet and are slow to leave land, and considering how fast the creatures are you'd run the risk of a bunch jumping aboard before you could get very far.

>Why wasn’t the farm fully soundproofed? If they knew to spin proof the babies room, why wouldn’t they do the same for the entire home?

>Instead of having painted markers on the floor, it’s have been easier to place sand or some other insulation there too right?

Very fair point.

>The children were horrible. The daughter had literally no self awareness of dimensionality as opposed to being a pain in the ass and nuisance for literally no reason. She knew no other way of living, why was it so hard to just follow your parents guidance.

I imagine being deaf in a horror movie doesn't help matters at all. She loathed her parents because she thought they blamed her for the kids' death, and resented them for it. She wanted to prove herself to them, and failed at it for the most part. But kids will be kids.

We need to know what the monster is and how it works for that tension. 

2) low death count? There are 5 characters 2 die. That includes killing a little kid in the first 5 minutes which films just don't do and then killing the main character near the end. There is so much tension because anyone could die.

3) they revealed the weakness to the audience not the characters creating dramatic irony. We know what They need to do but characters don't.

dwz9w9s,"1. They had only been alive for something like 40 days when they’re small child dies, so just because they make one mistake isn’t unbelievable.

2. I took the pregnancy as the only thing keeping them alive. I think they thought of the pregnancy as hope for a brighter future. If they didn’t have a baby on the way I think they would’ve offed themselves, just like that old man, much sooner. Yeah it’s dumb to have a baby in an apocalypse, but perhaps having a baby is the only normal thing they had left so they latched on to it.

3. The lighting system isn’t elaborate. They hung red lights and white lights. One switch turns on red, one switch turns on white. And also, I think the movie showed that the family was still building the baby shelter, with the kids still pasting paper to the walls to sound proof it. So I took it as they just hadn’t got around to it yet. This is because the baby came 3 weeks early as shown by the due date on the calendar. 

4. Power and water are definitely something that is hard to believe. The movie showed that there are many waterfalls and rivers near by, so I would assume they have some sort of hydroelectric system powered by the river that would also pump water to them. I don’t know if a system like this exists, but the movie is allowed to have some leeway there, just like every survival/apocalypse movie. How the fuck do they still have gas in the walking dead? All of it would’ve gone bad by now, but I don’t care because i don’t want to watch them have to walk everywhere.

5. There was never a situation where a floor squeaking in their main house gave away their position. Remember they have the big house with basement, but that’s not where they live. They live in an outhouse far away from the other house. If there was a point where the monster came into the house they live in and a floor squeak gave away their position, I would also be like “oh cmon they live there why would they not have fixed that” but that didn’t happen so it doesn’t matter.

6. The monster being able to rip open the silo was supposed to show us exactly how much they hated the high frequency hearing aid. That’s why the shot lingered for so long. When put into extreme pain they were able to do that, but when they’re just hunting I don’t think they’re able to rip through metal the same way.

7. There were a few times that I couldn’t believe that the monster couldn’t here them, but at least In the basement scene it showed that it couldn’t hear them because of the running water.",8a5qdo

* People make mistakes. Especially with the increased stress, I can see it happening. 
* Getting pregnant doesn't always happen voluntarily
* How could you build a door for the basement without attracting the creatures? An elaborate lighting system isn't loud to build. 

The monster seems agitated about the noise and runs away screaming to escape. Also I think I read somewhere that grain silos are not actually that thick compared to like an old truck.

2. So they'd camp out in a tent next to the waterfall? Sure it'll make living a bit easier but there are definitely a ton of downsides to literally living in the wild.
3. Lol this isn't a videogame with shitty AI. You can't honestly believe that should work. If they got used to the waterfall, they'd most likely get used to that sound and ignore it after a while. If they tried using that technique for where they live it'd also be way too risky and they'd have the constant worry of going back and recharging batteries for sound.
4. Same as before. They've become custom to the constant noise and would need to first draw them to their place with the waterfall noise which is just too risky. We're assuming its not just the noise but also the area, they can tell where the noise is coming from.
5. Mistakes happen. I agree it was definitely stupid of them but part of it could've been from remorse after their SON died.
6. Again, they just went to the waterfall to catch fish. Why would they make a pregnant woman hike for hours with them just so she could say a few words before they go back? The kid was obviously very scared to go, there's still a large risk getting there.

- Mother went into labor almost 3 weeks premature.

- The aliens would just break the boom box.

- The water fall doesn't attract the monsters because they can't stop the water fall. They can break a boombox that arbitrarily begins making noise,

dxad8zd,">characters that don’t really change

I don't see how you could've arrived at this conclusion if you were paying attention. The key character arc is Regan's redemption and the father's acceptance that he can't protect his deaf daughter forever. The film communicates pretty clearly that Regan blames herself for her brothers death and that she's projected that guilt outward to the point where she's convinced herself her parents don't love her. The father, on the other hand, is so obsessed with mitigating the risk of her deafness that he inadvertently reinforces his daugher's self loathing. Their arcs come full circle when he sacrifices he life and Regan finally accepts his love and forgives herself. With her new clarity of mind she was able to put her father's life in context which helped her discover the monsters weakness. Their character arcs were told visually, which is why this movie is good. It doens't shove bunch of stupid dialogue into the screenplay to explain the plot to people who aren't paying attention.

>The plot is so paper thin that you could explain it all in one sentence without missing any detail.

I can say the same about Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Blade Runner, Jurassic Park, The Shining, and every other high-concept movie ever made. If this is literally a litmus test for how you determine a good movie then you're favorite films must all be from David Lynch or something.

I guess your point about set pieces if valid, but anyone who saw the trailer understood that this was going to be a horror or a thriller than used silence to create tension. Most of the jump scares were excellently executed which justified their use in the film. Some of them were cheap and stupid, but no move is perfect. 

>he has nothing to really do because his character is so shallow

Again, I don't understand how you would come to this conclusion if you were paying attention. The character is established as determined and intuitive as he's managed to create an environment where his dead daughter has the best odds of survival given the current situation.

So you asked earlier why people were downvoting your opinion. It's because from a certain perspective it seems like you either fell asleep through most of the movie or just weren't really engaged when you were watching the film.

They had 360 degree super ear heads and made clicking noises for echolocation.

>In over 1 year they never made a mistake or a sound? The monsters conveniently start entering the house

They go through an excruciating amount of detail to show how careful they are about everything.

Not pushing another human out of their vagina with the entire rest of the family out and about.

>A newborn cries all the time, not when a monster is around the corner and then keeps quiet.

It's hard to cry and sleep at the same time. Let's say a baby cries 50% of the time. That means that it doesn't cry 50% of the time. Coin flips coming out in the favor of the protagonist is a silly complaint

So these things are way to fast to get a headshot on, their weak areas are almost always covered, if you fuck up a bait-and-kill you’re dead, and if you succeed then more monsters are going to be there in a minute to kill you. And that’s assuming you knew it would work.

A plot hole is a moment that directly contradicts something already established by the film's fiction, e.g. in The Karate Kid, Daniel wins the climactic fight with a previously established as illegal kick to the head.

Something that isn't 100% explained that requires you to just suspend disbelief and buy in is NOT a plot hole. You can feel its contrived, and not buy in and thats fine. None of what you listed above except perhaps #9 is a legitmate plot hole.

I agree that *A Quiet Place* puts a pretty big onus on the viewer to suspend disbelief and buy in. Personally, I was engaged in the emotional and poignant character study and the themes of loss, greif, forgiveness and parenthood. This emotional engagement helped me buy in to the contrivances of the conflict and suspend my disbelief.

Yes, the idea of gunfire attracting attention also shows up in many zombie movies/shows, but even then you'll see the protagonists using guns all the time.

Here, I think it was a pointed decision to not feature guns at all until the end. At first, watching the opening scene, I wondered ""Well why aren't they armed? At least as a last defense?"" Then the movie does a good job of showing us that, even as a last defense, shooting a gun means you're completely fucked, because every creature within miles will be on you.

Thus, using the gun at the end to finish off the monster was part of the cathartic feeling the ending was going for. ""We can finally fight back now."" It's also the reason for the shotgun rack at the very end that some people have criticized as cliche. I think it's actually thematically on point.",8a5qdo

This is not a terrible idea. But I think sometimes people don't understand why they are upset exactly. I'm sure the daughter thinks her father blames her for the brother's death. But she might not necessarily connect that blame with his basement rules.

See I read that simply as the dad trying to teach the son to be more self-sufficient.  Bringing the daughter might make the son more inclined to hang back and let her do everything as that seems to be their usual dynamic, whereas the dad clearly feels the son needs to be taken out of his comfort zone.  I think there's definitely some subtext too about him still being mad at her for refusing his next attempt at the cochlear implant.

You know something bad is going to happen, and you’re powerless to stop it. That builds tension and suspense and dread. 99% of the audience knows movie language enough to know that something as emphasized as that nail was is meant to be important later.

This plot was so full of holes.  I really wanted to like this movie.  If the alien can’t hear them around loud natural noises why did they live in a farmhouse in the middle of hundreds of acres?  Move next to the river or waterfall.  ",8a5qdo

My friend used to have this pair of really squeaky tennis shoes. We were shooting hoops in the park one day and every time he took a step it sounded like he was squeezing a squeaky toy. I was laughing so hard at it that at one point I fell to my knees and almost did a literal rofl.

It was the first/last/only time he ever said THAT to me, the last words he even said to me, even if it wasn’t the first time he ever showed me.

Ok, so to kill the aliens, Regan's cochlear implant (and, yes, it was a cochlear implant, not a hearing aid. A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them?

One of the things I thought was if it can hear a little sound from a long distance, how does the creature not get a sensory overload every time the wind blows from the deep creaking sound of trees and branches? Or how about the sounds of crickets at night? 

So it seems to me that they focus on the frequency of a sound and are accustomed to background noises

If we assume distinct, higher pitch, louder *novel* sounds are what attract it, then it could make sense. It hones in on specific *action* sounds, that are distinct from background noises.

dx08i22,"Yeah, that would be cool.  When my father was telling me the story of how he fled Laos it seemed like something out of a movie.  I'll tell it because it's a cool story.

My grandfather participated in the war.  My dad tells me that he did something along the lines of recon, finding enemy camps, troops numbers, stuff like that.  He would leave for months and return periodically from seemingly the depths of the jungle.  

One day, my grandfather returns.  He's done fighting but he isn't sure if it is necessary to flee yet.  Some time passes and I guess some news has spread that made my grandfather decide to flee the country.  My family heads out to a village to hide in for a bit (a neat detail that my father told be was that my grandfather hid his issued M16 rifle in a tree just in case he needed it again).  

They spend time in the village, and things seem to normalize.  They tried to blend in with the people in the village (I assume it's some neutral Laotion village).  There are soldier around the village carrying Ak-47's (Another cool fact, the AK's were called an ah-kah by the soldiers as my dad tells me).  Thing's seemed to be alright and my grandfather decided to head back home.  No one wants to leave home, and there maybe some unforeseen complications in the process of fleeing, so I can understand his decision.  

More time passes after returning to their original homes.  One of my father's uncles, well educated from a university in Thailand, shows up.  He comes to the village and somehow got his hands on a list that the Communists have that have the names of the people who aided the US in the war.  Yeah, that's right, THE EDUCATED UNCLE COMES INTO THE VILLAGE WITH A FUCKING LIST OF NAMES UP FOR EXECUTION.  My grandfather's name was on that list.  That was the moment that my grandfather knew the family had to get out.  

They wen't back to the same village.  My dad's educated uncle, coordinates the trip out of Laos.  My grandfather sends the family out in two groups.  The first group was him, a few of his sons ( I think my father was one of them) and a few other members.  The rest (including my Grandma) stayed behind and and would go later.  He did this so that, if one party was found by the Communists, the family bloodline would not be obliterated on the spot by bullets.  There would be two chances of survival.  

The trip seemed to have been decently smooth as my father really didn't talk much about the trip to the Mekong River.  He described to me the morning of the crossing.  It was pitch black, early morning, they woke up with silence and kept it.  This was the moment that they had to be the quietest because Communist patrols on the river were the most likely place for any sort of confrontation.  They reached a boat at the river bank (Educated Uncle leading the way).  They used paddles to cross halfway across the Mekong River.  The next half, they revved the engine and went full throttle to the other side (The Communists would't cross the river because it led into Thailand).  

They went to a refugee camp in Thailand waiting for the rest of the family to arrive.  You can imagine how anxious those long months of waiting would have been.  They eventually met up and began a rather long process of immigrating to the US (Fun Fact: My grandfather almost had us immigrate to Australia).   

That's the story.  ",8a5qdo

dxli54j,"Yeah there are, I recommend [""The Ravens""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1104712.The_Ravens?from_search=true) if you want a more broad approach on the Secret War in Laos.  That book follows the US's secret mission in Laos and follows the Pilots (called ravens) that flew in Laos.  The Hmong worked closely with them (like saving downed pilots) so the books talks about their involvement in the war.  There are a few cool photos in the book also.  

If you want a more Hmong focused reading then I recommend [""Tragic Mountains""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/725570.Tragic_Mountains).  That book gives you more context into Hmong culture and how they ended up intertwined with the Vietnam War.  ""Tragic Mountains"" also has a lot more detailed pictures than ""The Ravens"" which really adds to it.  ",8a5qdo
dzlzeiz,"My apologies if I was unclear, but the Hmong people lived in Laos.  Due to the North Vietnamese using trails in Laos to move supplies and troops, the US asked the Hmong to aid them in the Vietnam War because they didn't want to go ""boots on the ground"" in Laos.  After years of coordinating with the US in the war effort, the US lost the war and left.  Since the Hmong aided the US in the Vietnam war and since Laos and Vietnam were practically buddies now after the overthrow of the Laos Monarchy, communists ""Pathet Lao"" searched out Hmong people and executed them (with the exception of the minority of Hmong people who sided with them in the first place).

dxfon11,That's actually a really interesting answer. Super cruel on their 2 kids though!,8a5qdo
dwwzunm,Most of the movie takes place about 470 days afterwards. ,8a5qdo
dxcp4zf,Just wanted to let you know I agree with you wholeheartedly. The first half of the movie was interesting and after that the decisions just became too stupid,8a5qdo
dxg2tu3,"> There's no reason why the dad had to sacrifice himself.

I think perhaps the giant alien ripping apart the car with his children inside might've been a tiny reason...",8a5qdo
dwzpvgs,"Right? The trailers made this look, honestly? Dumb. But the hype got me curious and it turned out to be a beautifully executed film. ",8a5qdo
dx1ilii,Agreed but how dare we have a different opinion! ,8a5qdo
dx0787r,as she was coming down the stairs at that point i was like oh no god why but then when she got down there fine a bunch of people just started laughing...nervous tension laughter. that fucking nail.,8a5qdo
dx06fda,Me too! She wasn’t looking down! Freaked me out ,8a5qdo
dx0689q,Thought that as well. Would’ve been interesting.,8a5qdo
dwzq0rg,You mean Dominicans? ,8a5qdo
dwzf4v6,"I doubt they all showed up all over earth at the same time.

Regardless of how they were created (mutation, meteorite, etc) they probably started in one place. A few details were leaked about it. And from there people were on their own.

It could've taken weeks for them to spread across the world. And I bet a lot of people died regardless. ",8a5qdo
dx06aq2,Apparently Orlandoans don’t know how to act...,8a5qdo
dx06pbf,Our theater had someone's phone go off during the tense waiting period after the lantern tipped over. Worst timing.,8a5qdo
dwy96w2,"I was so scared I missed so many details. She WATCHED HIM DIE? On the security cameras?! 

On a side note, when the kids lit the fire at the top of the silo, and none of the fires light in the distance... Does that mean that the neighbors are dead? That they heard the loud noises and are in hiding, showing that everyone’s on their own? ",8a5qdo
dwzijtb,It was sad for me because he was so powerless. He’s a big guy and was wielding an axe but it swatted him aside with ease. He couldn’t physically fight it so all he had left to save his kids was to physically give his body to distract the monster ,8a5qdo
dww6yhz,"I think his death was impactful in the narrative. Without his sacrifice his daughter may not have made the connection that the hearing aid, or high pitched sound, was their weakness. ",8a5qdo
dww6hol,"I felt like it could've set up just a little bit more how futile his attempts to attack it would be. I felt like there could be just a **little bit** more effort from him I'm trying to protect his kids, or just a scene where he knows that the monster is too strong for him to attack. ",8a5qdo
dwwah2i,"Because it only happened where she knew, once. In the corn thing. 



The other time we see it (when she's looking at the light) she didn't even know the monster was there. But the audience did. ",8a5qdo
dwwc6tv,"Considering it took her 3rd encounter for it, it's not THAT long

Actually her 4th, but I don't count the 1st one since she had no idea it was there. 


So you look at it that way and it goes like:

First time, probably a strange experience at the worst fucking time

Second time, she turned it off as soon as it was bothering her

Third time, she put two and two together. 


Not that bad on paper ",8a5qdo
dwwgwxo,"First time, in field: she doesn't realize the creature is behind her, so she never sees it recoil or flee.

2nd time, in silo: she's under the door with her brother, can't see it recoiling in pain. Brother also can't see, and though he can hear it, the cries of pain it emits prob don't sound that different to him than it's usual call.

3rd time, in house: she realizes, she activates it, sees it, and knows.",8a5qdo
dwwenol,"Hell, even before that, the situation could've been avoided by them just hanging tight for a few minutes on the sand trail, instead of hiding in the car.  Still thought it was a very good movie, though, in spite of these small gripes.",8a5qdo
dwwfk4x,"That kind of ruined the ending for me. 

It’s this awesome, triumphant moment...but it’s tempered by knowing that as soon as the daughter has a moment to think about what happened she’s going to be emotionally destroyed. She was already struggling so much with her role in her brothers death, and now she has to live with knowing her father would have lived if she’d just kept her hearing turned on a bit longer.",8a5qdo
dwwaxzb,The first time she had no idea there was a monster behind her. The second time she probably thought it was randomly giving feedback and didn't want the distraction,8a5qdo
dwxafvc,"My exact memory of this scene isn't 100%, but when she's out in the corn field the monster is behind her, and it starts freaking out, but she doesn't see it, and therefore doesn't know what she has done at that point. And I think there is another scene between that and the end where it isn't completely clear to her what is happening.",8a5qdo
dwy0dyl,You try concentrating with that feedback squealing at you... ,8a5qdo
dwy7hpt,"She was deaf, and couldn't hear the fact that it put the monster in pain as she was typically focused on the pain it was causing her.  She didn't know that there wasn't another louder noise elsewhere that drew it away.",8a5qdo
dx54e85,"Honestly, they should all have at least one emergency timer to crank and throw to distract the monsters if they're ever trapped. Seems like you'd always want to have a distraction handy.",8a5qdo
dww5o5p,"I thought the same, I get the first time she didn’t see the monster, but when the we’re stuck in that water tower thing with the seeds I don’t understand how she didn’t connect the dots.",8a5qdo
dwy5btu,"Idont think she had any real reason to suspect it.

However I kind of feel sorry for the girl.  First she felt like she could have prevented her brothers death, and then she probably feels she couldve prevented her fathers death as well.",8a5qdo
dwyzmeq,Because she’s a terrified 10 year old? Not some super smart adult,8a5qdo
dwzazg7,"She’s deaf (obviously) but that means the first interaction the monster had with it she didn’t even know happened. She couldn’t see it and didn’t hear it. The second time , again, her vision is blocked by a metal plate, and again she’s deaf. True her implant is ringing and hurting her ears but she thinks her dad sucks at fixing them and they’re just broken. ",8a5qdo
dx4o8yt,"But he didn't know about the hearing aid yet, and she didn't really understand it either by that point. So he felt the only option he had to distract the monsters was to yell, even though the audience knows there may have been another option. It was brilliant because we quickly realize his attempt was *not* futile, because he had previously taught the boy how to escape in the truck silently without starting the engine. And then we realize the boy was not just pretend driving earlier in the movie, he was methodically practicing for when he would have to escape in the truck.",8a5qdo
dwxgsyd,"She couldn't hear the monsters either, so when it sent the first one off she had no idea. ",8a5qdo
dwxkmdh,She didn't see the thing behind her reacting to it and couldn't hear it because she was deaf.,8a5qdo
dwzgceq,Before that me it had only happened once when she knew there was a monster around. The first time she had her back turned and she didn't know it was behind her. ,8a5qdo
dx01cht,"I felt like the first time her hearing aid went off she had the look on her face like, ""shit, they don't like my hearing aid""

She even had a second encounter where she could have put the pieces together. 

When she turned it off in the truck, I just thought to myself, ""WHAT, WHY!?""",8a5qdo
dx1ckqm,She didn't see the monster the first time and she was kind of distracted the second time.  She doesn't have the benefit of the viewer's perspective.  ,8a5qdo
dx1js7u,I assumed he was mortally wounded by the first attack. Claws through the stomach seems like it would be fatal with no hospitals around. ,8a5qdo
dww5pnc,"Well the first time in the cornfield she didn't even know there was one behind her so it seemed like her hearing aid was just fucking up. Silo she probably should have put 2 and 2 together and by the 3rd time she was just getting pissed and turned it off. I too thought she'd be able to figure it out sooner but I can see how she didn't.

",8a5qdo
dx111w5,"Nah I think they needed an actual death in that end sequence. Even with the idea of the hearing aid being able to disorientate them. at that point his character was injured and only had a the pickaxe. Now sure maybe if he gets the pick jammed into those ears he might have something.

But I think it made more sense that until the bunker the daughter hadn't quite caught on yet. (The first time the feedback occurs she doesn't know there is a creature behind her)

So she only see's it once in the grain solo,  and then she experiences it in the car but turns it off.",8a5qdo
dx1pjva,"Counter point, I think he was gonna die anyway due to his wounds. From the split second glance we got he was bleeding pretty bad and even if they had proper medical equipment, something was probably punctured. ",8a5qdo
dx856zk,Well the first time we see it as an audience the alien is behind her and she doesn't even know its there cause she couldn't hear it walking up. Then she is in the silo when it attacks her again and honestly she was a little preoccupied at that time to do a lot of thinking about why it ran off. When it started to run at the car she had already turned it off and it wasn't until she saw it attack the tv that she started to figure it out.,8a5qdo
dx2hs86,"It actually wasn't a hearing aid. It was a cochlear implant... and because it was a cochlear implant the ending simply was complete bull shit. Ok, so to kill the aliens, Regan's cochlear implant (and, yes, it was a cochlear implant, not a hearing aid. A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them? It's basically just something that could be knocked off and hit the floor if they serve no other purpose than to just hang out on her head.",8a5qdo
dxdnmbi,I think he also wanted to make sure he told his daughter he loved her.,8a5qdo
dwypka5,After his talk with his wife it was pretty obvious where the movie was headed.,8a5qdo
dwwycmj,"I just don't understand that. Why the hell do people find it necessary to talk to a god damn screen during movies? Super 8 was ruined for me because the people behind me had some jackass thing to say at every single pause.

God damn it still pisses me off. Obviously.",8a5qdo
dwz3jvc,"There was a group of four next to us that kept shuffling and whispering and giggling the entire time. Finally my husband just said ""Jesus Christ shut up!"" during one or the quiet parts and the entire theater went silent after that lmao",8a5qdo

dxm562v,"I was in a mostly empty theatre  and there was only one guy in my row a seat away from me. He slept like 10 minutes into the movie snoring softly. Woke up every now and then when things got loud.

dwzwxwh,"Yeah, I wish those Necromorph creatures showed up and just annihilated anyone that was too loud. ",8a5qdo

dxfjnqy,They were following the rule of louder noises obscure small ones. They hoped the action scenes would mask their moist kisses. ,8a5qdo
dx1sagz,"Yeah, I always thought that the cinemas should drop their lame commercials and ads post trailers. In exchange put funny tutorials on how-to behavior for the environment. For silent films, perhaps try opening your drink or grabbing popcorn when there's the predictable loud jump scare noise. Hey, you know when the fireworks are coming, take advantage and slurp a sip, grab a handful, or adjust your seating. Every film has its moments to make a little noise.",8a5qdo
dwz3k3d,"I think it boils down to, he's a 4 year old child. He probably has never seen the monsters, and most kids don't listen to basic instructions that well. Ie, don't get those cookies until you finish your vegetables. ",8a5qdo

When a babies needs are constantly being met then there's no reason to hardly ever cry, nevermind have colic. Colic isnt a normal natural thing babies get. So when you feed a baby artificial processed milk (formula) that hurts their stomachs, and force them to sleep alone (A common thing in the US) then yeah your chances of having a screaming baby are high.

dx1y8fi,How would creatures that big find enough food to sustain themselves underground? ,8a5qdo
dxbjr3f,"I think this had something to do with their advanced hearing which seemed akin to a radio that scanned multiple frequencies. Presumably, this is why they couldn't get near the girl's cochlear implant, as Jim had added some sort of radio transceiver to it in hopes that that would help, but what it actually does is cause a feedback loop from similar frequencies which I think the monsters were tuning into that caused them distress.

This is all some sort of pseudo radio science from me, I'm sure it wouldn't work like this in real life, but I think this is the logic route the movie was trying to take. ",8a5qdo
dwwxt33,Cloverfield much haha,8a5qdo
dx3df5r,"That's another reason I thought that they would be a weapon of some kind. If they were just a normal species, they would eat what they killed. It wouldn't make any sense otherwise. Also, creatures in nature that are incapable of sight usually have all of their other senses heightened, like a powerful sense of smell. Seeing as how humans are extremely noisy animals, it would seem that the creatures hunting by sound indicates that they were specifically designed to hunt humans. ",8a5qdo

dzx0rbl,"A radio/walkie talkie in the woods with the volume turned on ma probably would have worked. Then on the sender radio have it be able to take an audio input from the mp3 players that they have or something so the sender/local radio won't need any noise going into it. Seems very basic 

Or even go full non tech method and have a long string going into the forest from the house and tie it to a pan in the trees, pull the string and it'll pull the pan out of the trees onto the floor half a kilometer away or so. That'll be a loud gong if it lands on metal.

Or he just simply had electricity going to the far edges of the farm  to power the lights, hook a speaker up to them and have a long audio cable going back to the house so you can play music when you need to.

Just feels like a few easy options and that the remote noise idea wasn't even considered apart from with an egg timer.

It's not even that hard to trap one (theoretically), just bait with sound. I was disappointed that the humans were pretty much wiped or at least that's what I assumed. But I remembered that this isn't a movie where humanity is at war. It's about the families/groups that are isolated during the attack and have to essentially survive on their own.

Like most apolyptic scenarios with monsters, we always see humanity fight back but in the early stages it's chaotic. It takes a long time for everyone to re-organize and even longer to reclaim land. 

It's nice to see the perspective of isolated survivors. I just wish they had more sound traps. Like if cell phones still works you could plant some far away and if you're ever in a pickle just call the bait cell phones. ",8a5qdo

Hitchcock described a scene of a table with a group of people eating dinner and suddenly a bomb goes off giving 10 seconds of shock.

Give the audience that tiny piece of information and you instantly have a suspenseful scene because the audience knows something that the characters don't know.

Most modern military's also use passive deterrence systems which use it too.  So do malls, theatres, grocery stores, etc to deter people from loitering.    Its pretty common.  So yeah... loosing that fight is about the largest plot hole of the movie.  It makes the assumption that people dont know how to use Google.  ",8a5qdo
dxrh311,"Agreed. It was the frequency, not the sound itself. As for the aliens, their planet exploded (or some part of it) and their evolutionary design allowed them to survive on chunks of it which fell to earth. They weren’t looking for a planet. They were purely animals. They don’t hunt for food or fun, but simply to eradicate noise because they’re sensitive to it and wanted to make this new planet they accidentally happened upon into, well, *a quiet place*

I read that Krasinski had in mind the story of crawfish from the movie *RocknRolla*, how they were introduced to the river and it was a species that couldn’t be held back in this new ecosystem where the existing species didn’t have any experience with it. He also joked *like wolves being let loose in a day care*. So they weren’t thinking beings with any motive or intent, is the idea. But i do appreciate the decision to not put that exposition into the movie itself. ",8a5qdo

dxs0eym,Agreed.,8a5qdo
e2jx6oq,Carrying enough supplies to build a home by the river would be a staggering risk,8a5qdo
e35n5pc,They probably learned pretty early on that water isn't something they can kill. They probably did attack a river or a waterfall to begin with and found they couldn't harm it. A speaker wouldn't last ten seconds.,8a5qdo

dx1i6ih,"The advantage of being alien is that all bets are off. You want to say their armor can withstand nuclear fire? Why not, they are aliens! 

My headcanon is that they are weapons deployed by other aliens. Kind like Edge of Tomorrow (mimics arrived in meteors as well by the way), only this time humanity lost as Rita didn't sign up in the military. ",8a5qdo

Right after their baby was killed, and kids (well, one of them) can hear everything that happens in the house!",8a5qdo
dx3u1ww,"Having a baby also risked the life of the mother, without any doctors around.

If it was oxygen and not gas, the baby would hyperventilate and get even louder I guess, and if it was gas, he could have been easily killed.

You know the difference between the experienced Alamo patrons who really try to be quiet, and the newbs who show up right when the movie is starting, and do shit like look at the menu with their phone as a flashlight during the trailers, and whisper too much?

Unfortunately my showing had too many of the latter. Phone screen glare all over the movie screen.

I will admit that I laughed out loud when the kid ran into the tire and knocked himself out.",8a5qdo

dx4kooc,and Brief Conversations with Hideous Men as awell,8a5qdo

dxfa6gw,Then your husband commits suicide by screaming in front of a man and his boy. ,8a5qdo
dxfx2l9,You put the speakers up and then the monsters destroy the speakers. ,8a5qdo
dxohhxm,Why do you assume they were the only ones on the planet? I took it to mean that there were 3 in the area and therefore hundreds of thousands across the entire United States.,8a5qdo
dztxlio,Way too many jump scares for my taste,8a5qdo
e0415gp,which 'small bang' are you talking about? I just supposed that things like soft panting don't cross a threshold of hearing for the aliens. ,8a5qdo
e33fxi0,Yeah that is a good point about them being finished off before being able to relay the weakness to other survivors.  I mean we only knew of 3 confirmed monsters in the area but there could be another area where the monster population was much more dense. I wish we were told more of how they got here and how many there were. ,8a5qdo
dx60y87,"I did find myself thinking when they were at the waterfall that either the mom and baby or kids should live there until the baby's old enough to be quiet. Your way is harsher, but probably the best way to guarantee the older kids' safety.",8a5qdo
dx60w4o,"I like that! If they have to do it, that would have been the way. I was actually a little underwhelmed by the yell anyway so only gains in having it from her POV.",8a5qdo
dx5v0vd,that would have been cool. I liked it as is but I do reading how people would change little things and make cool things even cooler.,8a5qdo
dx61o0r,"I'll readily admit that more thought is needed for why she'd turn it on again. Maybe just never have her turn it off? But, and this is coming from someone who can usually make peace with movie deaths, I still dislike his death in that place in the script. It tugged on my heartstrings (like, a LOT), but it was premature. 

To my eyes, the dad did resent/blame the daughter a little, though he obviously tried not to - which is a super interesting aspect of the parenthood theme that few dramas, let alone horror movies, will touch. Resolving that line requires him seeing her value instead of just her being a danger - seeing how she's learned from her mistake (seeing her save the family, for example). He'd also have to come to terms with how not ok it is to blame her, and then they both grow. Emotional payoff galore. 

This way, not only did she also play a part in her father's death too, the people she did save never blamed her in the first place, so her victory isn't a redemption as much as just an (admittedly cool) ""yay, better late than never"". 

Hope I don't come off too strong here by the way, I respect that we have different ideas of what the heart of the movie is/could be. I just like digging in, so I went for it.",8a5qdo
dx5zna9,Then it should have been done in a way that made sense. I felt like I was watching Tremors,8a5qdo
dxdkurp,[deleted],8a5qdo
dxgkpvp,"Yeah it was the high frequency sound that caused the armor to open up. I think it was pretty clear since visibly its armor shifted revealing its inside ""flesh"" (or whatever word you would use to describe it). But apparently only high frequency made it uncomfortable enough to open its head. ",8a5qdo
dxgguhl,Clearly during the battles with the military and incredibly loud noises the monsters never opened up their head to listen. Just needed that cochlear implant and a shotgun and the world would have been saved ,8a5qdo
dxgmfdk,"I'm sure this wasn't the first monster in the movie's universe to ever be killed. For all we know the military has already started implementing this very strategy (or was even able to kill some of the monsters through brute force), but because the world is so devastated by this point their progress is very slow.",8a5qdo
dxgptv1,"Indeed, and I also find it incredulous that the radiation from nukes left em unharmed.. That thin layer of “armor” can deflect a direct missile strike? Wut? Vibranium or some alien heat/ radiation/ impact resistant bs?",8a5qdo
dy1v00n,"Given this fucked over the entire planet of 7 billion people, I'm pretty confident someone would have quickly figured out how to hurt them with sound. Accidental or otherwise ",8a5qdo
dyug8oy,"Exactly lol. Like, every problem they have would be solved by living next to Niagara falls or something. Or on a boat. They don't have boats? I get that the creatures can swim and I know sound carries over water, but you park your boat 50 miles offshore in any direction and I think youre good.

I liked the movie, but the ending was kinda garbage. The ol ""kid puts it together at the last second and saves the day"" was lame. ",8a5qdo
e3fozye,"That was so weird, the truck conveniently rolled off in such a way to reach the house? WTF?",8a5qdo
e3f6zv4,"Na man, 4x4 trucks when the engine off make no noise at all /s",8a5qdo
e3dbn5u,"I'm not sure if say they where without basics, food and water, power, heat, shelter, let's behonest they could talk in some places like where the baby couldn't be heard, if he was broken it. Would be from the child's death i think ",8a5qdo
e56aqha,"At first, no one even knew that the aliens relied on sound to hunt.  The military probably just assumed that they could kill it like any other organism.  As seen on the whiteboard, they tested guns and bombs on it, and never realized that the plates could expose the vulnerable part of the alien.  Though I do agree that the movie may have exaggerated the capabilities of the aliens taking over the world, there were most definitely more aliens in other areas.  If several of them attacked military bases around the same time, they could potentially ruin any chance that the military had to figure out how to destroy them.  Someone in a different area could’ve killed some aliens, but the movie focuses on just the Abbott family.  Please also note that the writers of the movie would have to make the aliens stronger in order to make their conquering of the world more believable, thus sealing the fate of the Abbott family.",8a5qdo
dwwqlwu,"Not sure really sure what the PG-13 rating has to do with it. There's what, a handful of dialogue? That rules out profanity. There are 3 character deaths, so I suppose those could have been more gruesome, but not sure if it would have added much. And then nudity would have been out of place.",8a5qdo
dx0gykp,"I think it was mostly done for aesthetic purposes. 

Tallest to smallest looks pleasing to the human eye and makes for great shots (ignoring the fact that the father was carrying the middle child). 

The suspense of the father all the way in the front sprinting past his three family members just added to the tension. ",8a5qdo
dx0hazb,EXACTLY. why didn't the parents sandwich the kids between them? fucking idiotic.,8a5qdo
dx09k7d,"I disagree, I think given the fact that you thought of those things, it was already perfectly communicated and didn’t need to be called back to. We understood. Personally, I hate it when films cut back like that. Like we get it, the film is only an hour and half long, we remember what happened, it’s not necessary and I think it’s a weak device. ",8a5qdo
dx0hbkq,that would be some cheesy and unnecessary editing.,8a5qdo
dxcykn2,I also would've hid the alien from the audience when it kills rocket kid. This also felt like the film showing its hand too early. It should've just cut to close up of John's face and we hear the monster take the boy. It would've made the monster scarier,8a5qdo
dxdhgkp,"The problem with that is it then makes the movie about the monster and what it is, instead of the family and who they are. By taking that mystery away they removed that question from being foremost in the viewer's mind and focused on the issues the family was facing.
",8a5qdo
dxesqpa,This is a very good point. A unified global Takeover would take a lot of numbers. Makes sense for it to be gradual. ,8a5qdo
dxewb6v,"U/Robotoboro had a good point earlier in this thread. If the fighting started overseas, our folks would have some time to distribute info. Once the monsters made it stateside, I can only assume operations would end. Along with life as we know it, lol. ",8a5qdo
dxevwtj,"Hats off to them. A regular war is bad enough, but an unknown enemy with no known weaknesses? Their motivation would be so much more noble than Pulitzer consideration. Similar to our protectors in the military. Nothing but respect for the people made like that. ",8a5qdo
dx7land,"This was a jury-rigged thing, with some amplified speakers at work. ",8a5qdo
dx8193v,"Yeah but it took that deaf child over a year to get the right implant that would damage them. When John hands her the device, he signs something about ""the frequency"" being different. We have to assume that her pervious devices didn't effect the monsters the same.",8a5qdo
dx83kmh,I really don't see creatures unable to get through a pickup truck breaking their way into a secured bunker. I mean maybe logistically after 5 years the military outposts have starved to death. What are these creatures going to borrow through feet of cement on a hunch?  ,8a5qdo
dxbvfc9,"I wish I had the balls to call someone out like that. I think if did tho and they doubled down, I would snap and just say ""ok then, well, I'm going to follow you home after the movie and slit your throats k :)"" with my serious, creeper stare.",8a5qdo
dxb35xs,"Not really, they were quieter (har har), but were just sort of whispering.

I mean, I usually am not the one to call out other people's behavior in public, but for a movie like this, in which the tension is built through silence, it's pretty damn obvious you have to shut up. Some people are just so selfish they don't understand or care that there's other people around them.",8a5qdo
dxbuvii,Tell on them next time.,8a5qdo
dxbv94d,"People are scum. I shouldn't have bought popcorn but I was hungry and it's the only thing I'm gonna eat today, but I at least waited to chew until there were scenes with noise and I still felt self conscious/bad about it.",8a5qdo
dxb85j8,"It's like they go to movies explicitly to frustrate a room full of people.

I'm not interested in going to a theatre that doesn't police disturbances and cell phones judiciously. People aren't entitled to wasting my time and money and businesses that enable people to do so don't deserve my money.",8a5qdo
dxcm157,That makes no sense at all. Babies in that scenario is anything but hope.,8a5qdo
dxco5ez,"I could buy this.

If there wasn't any hope, they would have thrown the towel in. 

Example being the elderly couple in the woods. With the nightly fires being lit earlier in the movie, I assumed the couple finally cracked and gave up (hence the lack of fires later in the film). ",8a5qdo
dxcxk5r,"But babies cry sooo much and so loudly, in a world setting with monsters that hunt by sound, it just doesn’t make any sense. Why risk the whole family for one baby?",8a5qdo

dxk3q4c,Somebody has to steal the popcorn,8a5qdo
dxmf12c,"why not
",8a5qdo
dwywsip,Maybe just a tent or something easy to put up. A little sound near the waterfall won’t attract the creatures. Having two places would be beneficial so when the wife went in labor it would have been okay for her to make noise. Also there is fish there so they can eat. The main cabin would be used for farming and communication. It’s just that babies make fucking hella noise lmao. ,8a5qdo
dwzsk4i,"Because that's louder than a waterfall right? You don't need power tools to build a cabin, heck even some tents will do the trick",8a5qdo
dwyz9v4,"Was this actually confirmed? As far as I know the newspaper just says that a meteor landed somewhere in Mexico. I thought it was only ever implied that they were linked, not confirmed",8a5qdo
dx83svd,"Thanks, I'll have to check those out. ",8a5qdo
dx8s126,"That's a interesting perspective, what country are you from and do you have any examples of what you consider ""American over acting?"" BTW, a ton of the actors you see in Hollywood films are classicly trained British actors. ",8a5qdo
dx85i4n,"That's interesting, I really felt her performance. I actually teared up a couple times, but I also have a family member who is deaf so that probably influenced me. ",8a5qdo
dx86m9m,The fact that this film didn't expressly state through dialogue the origin of this conflict would confirm to the majority of audiences what I stated. ,8a5qdo

dx3itvr,Monsters would destroy the speakers almost immediately. They wrecked a TV just for buzzing.,8a5qdo

dxg300s,"Fair enough but they were well aware about sound basically meaning death by day 89. 

Super smart or flukes, a baby makes absolutely no sense at all. I would be too scared to even have sex because it could lead to a “crying for no reason” baby and eventually a “not going to listen anyway” toddler lol 

Then again, I’m just knit-picking what was an all around great movie. 

Edit: Also, I think they were at the pharmacy specifically to find meds for the sick boy. ",8a5qdo

The kids go up there long after dark, there wouldn't be any neighbours on their grain silos watching for a fire.",8a5qdo
e338bd6,"I never really figured out the camera layout so hopefully you're right about it only being the other two. Makes the ending seem a lot less silly to me (albeit badass). I figured the fireworks would attract more though as it'd be a sound heard for miles as opposed to something more localized. 

But at the end of the day I really don't know. It's just a theory. I was more concerned why hadn't we heard anything from any of the neighbors we know survive around them. The absence of the ""lighthouses"" made me try to find an explanation why.",8a5qdo
e2ylqal,"We basically have the same idea then :) There seems to be enough intelligence in them to figure out what's worth hunting and what's not.

But to answer your question, when the father took his wife and child into the basement, one of the creatures followed him into the building hearing the baby but was unable to find them before they got into the soundproof room underground. While looking for them, it tore up the building and caused a leak in a large container of water. We saw the leak when he exited to search for his other two children. I'm no farmer but I think it was a drum or container specifically for watering the crops so it was a large enough amount to flood the room below.",8a5qdo

dx1wmos,"I feel like it undermined his character that he didn't try to fight, even against all odds. They spend so much of the movie showing that this guy is a survivor.

She had no concept of what was going on during that exchange nor that the monster even was reacting to the  implant's noise.

Also, the alien’s weakness is clearly explained in the news articles that the camera pans over slowly at the beginning. The aliens are indestructible because their armor covers their entire body. The movie shows how these creatures hunt for their prey, by getting close to it  by hearing sound, and then opening up their armor to use high frequency echolocation to specifically find where their prey is. 
So obviously, during an invasion, the military would get wiped out from throwing military power at the aliens due to their impenetrable armor. 
With the daughter’s ear piece, it specifically works when the creatures are closer to the humans. The high frequency sound causes the aliens to open their shells around their head as they suffer, exposing their inner flesh, allowing Emily Blunt to shoot and kill them. Since there are only 3 of the creatures in the area where the family is, it is implied that this is how Emily Blunt and the daughter kill the 3 aliens and then live in peace. ",8a5qdo

Ok, so to kill the aliens, Regan's cochlear implant (and, yes, it was a cochlear implant, not a hearing aid. A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them?

He never witnessed the backlash the hearing aid did to the creatures, so there's no way for him to assume that static/white noise/music would cause any harm or confusion to them. He probably would assume that the creatures would attack the speakers, destroy them and, best case scenario, they start hunting around that area for anything else. So he opted to stay silent instead.

The best I could come up with was that parents were at the front because the people at the front would be more likely to first encounter the beasts because the beasts operate by sounds and would be alerted by approaching footsteps so the people at the back are safer. If the beasts were already behind the family, they wouldn't be alerted by the family walking away. Had it not been for the toy rocket, the toddler was safest at the back. 
Sort of like walking through a mine field. People at the front incur most of the risk. 

Normally the older boy, who was injured, would be at the back in the unlikely event of a rear attack so he can alert the family and also to watch the toddler. The daughter was deaf so perhaps her being at the back had no advantages although she should still have watched the toddler. Her mistake was the cause of her later guilt issues.

Again, i don't think it was a conscious decision, but it was still part of the humanity of the characters and it grounded them; that _despite_ evil monsters living among them, life could still happen, and they were trying to make it work. It was obvious that they were trying to live a normal life, they had a comfy home, the mom was still teaching her kid poetry, they were playing monopoly, _they were trying_. Otherwise, you'd expect them to be 24 hour on self defense training and the first hour of the movie would be about kids making traps, learning how to shoot guns and learning krav maga or some shit.

The father was a survivalist, so his basement may have already been decked out even before the aliens landed. Moving that equipment, and potentially losing the surveillance since you can't reliably move all of the wiring, means that relocation is probably not the most advantageous thing to do.

In this situation, you'd also want to live near food. If the nearest farm isn't right beside a river, then that means tilling the land (noisy). Taking over someone else's farm, or just continuing to work your own farm takes less effort.

I think a big thing here is that they knew ASL before the aliens landed. If they didn't know a non-verbal language, then moving next to the waterfall probably *is* the best course of action for them. The daughter saved them, not just at the end, but in the beginning as well. ",8a5qdo

1) Should they sink in corn like that? If yes, how come they stop sinking when holding a metal door AND a monster's weight above them?

2) Why there aren't more sound based diversion devices? Specially when the fact that they are extremely prepared and thoughtful is stablished

3) Why the dad tries to fight the monster physically instead of using sound? Same goes for kids who try running instead of just keeping quiet and moving to another place

4) How did they plant and harvest the things in the fields without making noise? The same goes for other things up in the house

5) Why no more sound-proof rooms?

6) Why not establish your base near the river?

7) Why having a baby in a world like that and how does that baby makes no sound ever?

8) How did the mom took so long to wake up in order to the room to fill with water like that?

9) How the car with the kids made no noise while going downhill to their house?

Apart from that, they literally follow the ""show, don't tell"" premise in the sense that characters don't speak; but the way they CONSTANTLY show important plot devices in such an obvious manner, underestimates a lot the audience imo",8a5qdo

2) Speed would be my answer here. I mean the speed they wiped us out. Imagine thousands of those things and how quickly they could annihilate cities and military bases.

3) We honestly can’t know as there’s never a direct clue in the movie. All we can do is speculate that as they wiped out all major cities on earth (shown in the list of crossed out locations by the Dad’s radio) and there’s still at least 3 for a few miles of isolated woodland that there’s a lot.

4) Again their biology isn’t really covered beyond the fact that they’re A)Armoured and B) Blind so your guess is as good as mine.

They had a system that, while perhaps higher in risk, allowed them to take more advantage of their home, food on the farm, electricity (there were solar panels on the roofs), and shelter of various forms (the main house, the shed with the basement, the silo). Additionally, the dad had all his electronics and equipment that he was using to try and communicate with the outside world, as well as make a new cochlear implant for his daughter.

* the town is in complete decay with street lights fallen and weeds poking through large cracks in the street only 3 months into the invasion

* newspapers were able to capture, write about, print and distribute articles about the monsters somehow

* why did no one think that blind creatures who have *super sensitive hearing* might be disoriented by sound 

* All governments globally were wiped out? Really? With all their bunkers and air force ones and space stations and shit?

* how is there ALWAYS a creature within 8 inches of your position? Do they bodyslam every tree that falls over? Seems like a giant wood chipper would wipe them out

* Are they totally useless in the rain? Why live in the most quiet place possible... 

* why tf would the sister give her little bro a toy that the father treated like a hand grenade?

* a year seems like a long time to be living with someone for the subjects of love and guilt and blame to never get brought up

* how does the sister simultaneously reject the father's indefatigable attempts to help her and also believe he hates her

* is energy free or something? Why did they even have a kerosene lantern if electricity was working fine?

* knowing that the creatures are armored, the father grabs and loads a gun...... instead of just going and looking for his kids

* why is the cellar flooding

* the creatures ignore footsteps but hone in on the fathers breathing. But not the mothers frantic panting...

* an old ass truck which probably hasn't been moved in 1.5 years rolled downhill  immediately when the ebrake was released.. (because tires don't deflate and brakes dont rust)... all without making a single sound

* seems like a good diversion is only a rock toss away, too bad no one told the father

* children sink in grain but not big ass lanky ass creatures

He had made it almost 3 months in, unless the aliens had not been in their area until recently that means they had lived in the same excruciating carefulness and silence that we witnessed 400 days in. Either he was the best behaved and most quiet 4 year old in the world even though he only partially ubderstood the danger through all that time, or he was scared shitless into silence.

There would have to be like 10 million of these things in order for them to really pose a threat to our species as a whole, because of our population and the rate at which we reproduce. 

And then even if they did hunt most of us down, or into hiding, they would then all start to die of starvation. Humans and our domesticated livestock make up like 2/3 of Earth's terrestrial animal biomass. As soon as they ate all the easy prey, they would have nothing to sustain themselves. We see them eat a raccoon. But can you imagine how many raccoons a creature like that would have to eat in order to maintain that kind of high speed lifestyle?

She consistently fails to communicate (at least to her children) that she’s actually still grieving and that she blames herself for rocketkid’s death. If the lighting is to be any indication of the passage of time she sits in her deceased son’s room for at least an hour or two. Deep down she realizes it’s not possible to protect her children forever, making the due date for her birth ironically dreadful. She abdicates her responsibility when she tells her husband “you” must protect them. When she watches him die she no doubt recalls the guilt of losing her first son, as her husband was just keeping his promise. As the monsters kill Lee she begins to realize the futility of wasting so much energy to preserve her children’s naivety and brandishes a shotgun, which given what we know about the monsters, is just going to end in monster assisted suicide. In the final shot we see that the example she chooses to set going forward is no longer an insincere optimism, but the same determined courage that defined her husband. 

That brings us to Lee. Lee has three defining traits. His first trait is that he is courageous. He is always first to take initiative when shit hits the fan. He runs to save rocketkid, he investigates the strange noises, and he doesn’t hesitate to arm himself for a fight he knows he has no chance in hell of ever winning. His courage is important because he’s not actually afraid of the monsters, he’s afraid of failing to protect his children. His displays of courage aren’t an insincere attempt to set a good example for the children. They’re out of a genuine instinctual drive to survive. He recognizes that his son is generally anxious and his primary motivation for the second act is to teach him courage. This courage is partially responsible for his death as well seeing as how he could’ve gotten to safety with his children, but hesitates to unsheathe a hatchet. He, like his wife, realizes an issue with the example he has been setting.

dxpz7bx,"It wouldn't matter, the creatures are clearly mortal, set up a speaker sitting next to a large explosive, or a few M-60 machine guns with DU rounds and it isn't going to matter how many there are.

A better solution is that there was not an apocalypse scenario at all, instead the government is conducting a bioweapons test on a small rural town, while feeding the inhabitants false information via fake reports, and fake radio signals to keep the experiment going. It is clearly shown that there are still plenty of people around, even in their little area, so the lack of radio signals would likely be because they are being jammed, not because they aren't around.",8a5qdo

dxc4yve,"I actually agree with all of your points except #5. I grew up on a farm, and the quicksand qualities of grain in a silo (or anything with walls, such as a delivery trailer) is definitely a thing. Farm kids are warned from an early age not to ever play in them.  A nice smooth pile of corn is tempting to kids because it looks like it would be kind of like jumping in a pile of leaves, except it's much heavier and you can't get out. I really don't think the boy would have been able to pull the girl up once she was entirely buried; that stuff is *heavy*.

It's more likely to happen around the edges, because it's usually the result of a void or low-density area created when you take some of the contents out.  (Silos are loaded from the top but are usually unloaded via chutes or doors near the bottom.)

Bonus farm knowledge: hay makes an incredible sound dampener, incidentally. My sister and I used to make hay forts when we were little, and you could literally scream from the inside and not be heard.  (This was super-unsafe in retrospect, like many of our other beloved farm activities.)",8a5qdo

dxchd1g,"1. Probably for the deaf girl, who didn't have as easy of a time moderating her noise level.  And shoes definitely make you walk and run different, and would require a lot more caution than going barefoot.  Also when would shoes have changed anything about this movie?
2. Assumption that the other daughter was with the younger child, that she was closer to the group than they thought she was, that she didn't end up getting the noise-making toy, or just a lapse of concentration.  Believe it or not, sometimes you lose track of your kids for a little bit, especially teenagers.  It's not ""okay"", but it's not unheard of.
3. Uh, literally all my experience in houses, apartments, and dorms say otherwise, as well as the laws of physics.  Sound carries, it's not completely muffled by barriers.  Ever heard your neighbors arguing?  Also I think they lived more out of the barn rather than the house, and the barn was a bit more secure in general.  Also, closing doors makes noise I guess, not much, but potentially enough to warrant it with someone that has a hearing disability.
4. Planes are loud as fuck.  Yes it's muffled, but the sensation of noise is absolutely still there, and most houses aren't built to muffle all noise coming from them, all of them expensive and time-consuming, not to mention noisy.  They spent about a year just to soundproof the one room.
5. Uh yes, people do die in silos, mostly grain, but it can and does happen.  They were holding onto to the door to keep from going completely under.
6. I think the baby was potentially in response to the other child's death.  That being said, it was an irresponsible decision, but that doesn't make the movie bad, it just means the characters sometimes made bad decisions, which is definitely a part of life.
7. Just spreading resources out potentially.  Nice to have candles in reach if electricity goes out, and some people just enjoy the lighting.
8. Are you kidding?  Anywhere remotely urban would have been decimated.  Way too much noise for people to have survived effectively.  It'd maybe be safe to go to now, after everyone has died, but there'd definitely be more of the creatures there than out in the countryside.
9. I think that truck in particular was older and sturdier than others, other cars might not have fared as well.  Their house did have walls and doors, but if doors can be busted open by a well-placed kick how are they supposed to stand up to these aliens?",8a5qdo

dwzxw2e,"They *were* using sound as a weapon against them. That’s why they used fireworks and hunted fish by the loud waterfalls etc. They were using sound to *avoid* them in dire situations because it’s more feasible than going up to one and shooting it in the face. What the daughter did with her frequency thing is something that only she could discover because she was deaf and thus was the only one who needed to interact with that device. The whole point of the movie is that she felt responsible for her brother’s death and she redeemed herself at the end by saving the rest of her family (or figuring out the weapon which can save them in the future).

Also, do you think your first instinct would be to produce a super loud frequency sound in hopes that it would scare away a monstrous creature that is literally an enigma to everyone on the planet except for the fact that they know it hunts by SOUND? WHY WOULD YOU MAKE NOISE TO SCARE AWAY SOMETHING THAT ONLY HUNTS BY NOISE? WOULD YOU RISK YOUR LIFE TO DO SOMETHING THAT STUPID?

dxflmnr,"Let me just say I loved this movie and though it was great. I'm not trying to pointlessly hate on it or tear it down, in fact I'm going to go see it a second time in theaters.


Though I will say that my biggest issue is that you're assuming a lot of incompetence from a lot of people. Even if we give the creatures physically impossible breeding and movement speed, that still gives weeks or months for them to spread to the rest of North America. Even with all the chaos, news outlets would be broadcasting all of destruction plus there was time for the military to pinpoint that noise triggers the monsters and to issue a warning (as seen in the newspapers). I'm no flag bearing spec-ops wannabe but I have a very hard time believing that the military would be *that* incompetent to the point where they can't make ""a leap in logic"" and try playing with sound or frequency with the monsters, especially if bullets were as ineffective as was claimed and that they knew noise was the way they ""saw"". Doubly so, government officials/military people would have gone into bunkers, nuclear powered ships... again I doubt that they wouldn't be listening for S.O.S signals we saw Jim Halpert broadcasting. What I'm trying to get at is that there would be time for a government to react to this. China, Russia, all countries that could watch the US fall apart and have at least a bit more time to react. 

And how did they take over the world anyways? How did they hop continents? The monsters show no real strategy or high level intelligence, they just charge at noise. The newspapers did say that bombs and bullets didn't work (which I'll believe since they're aliens) but no effort to move to islands? To capture one? They can tear through metal but in the movie all of those were thin sheets (like the corn silo). 

You also seem to keep assuming that there aren't 7 billion people on Earth... There would easily be someone who could hook up a sound system to confuse the creatures somewhere. You also seem to forget that Jim Halpert had a radio set up, live cameras recording his property, and and a working plumbing system... Like I honestly don't know how you think that he couldn't set up at least a rudimentary last ditch speaker system to confuse the monsters at least for a second.

Now I didn't hate the movie despite of this or thought that it suffered because of it but it seems like your defense of those issues seem to rely on you/the viewer making an awful lot of assumptions on behalf of the movie. And I will say, I completely agree with you if you're referring to just Jim Halpert's family (on most points). But the whole world has gone quiet (heh puns).

dxez3jw,"The army has sound weapons, electromagnetic jammers, Faraday cage protection, etc. If they need sound to ""see"", they'd be easily distracted with flash bang grenades or the like.

Based on Big Tuna not finding anyone on any frequency on his radio, it's implied that even those places are gone. How?

dxxr0zu,">I mean, the point is made that they are almost supernaturally resilient, although I would find it more believable that they know the area by now, as they appear to be able to navigate the house, meaning they have been in the house prior.

They have to at least sense their envionment in some way before they can then build a ""virtual"" map of the area in their mind. They first have to collect the information where all the objects are standing somehow, before they can build a mental representation of that in their head. Mhh ....maybe every tree makes a different sound given the total numbers of its leaves,but trees lose leaves all the time, so they have no fixed amount of leaves which do not change.Yes maybe creature can sense the shape of the magnetic field of the earth at any given time and place and navigate by that, like birds do parthwise.In addition to that the mind and memory system of this creature could be so powerfull, that it has perfect memory and just can map all the tree points by hearing their leaves make sound.

>The map seemed to indicate they are closer than that, but again, it may well be they are familiar with their hunting grounds.

It happens in all the scenes that the creatures reach them in under 10 seconds.No matter where they are.

>That would require building, wouldn't it? Building is loud, shouting might not attract them but I feel like hammers might, if you didn't notice it appears everyone is living on abandoned property judging by the fire signals and only other people encountered. Living riverside has disadvantages, especially in stormy weather, and how close would they have to be to be truly masked? They're also far from their grains, and surrounded by trees, so protective layouts would be difficult, and with roots there could be no digging of any kind, also too loud.

There are also construction methods where you can glue wooden houses together and/or screw them together.If they manage to bring tones of sand onto the road, where they clearly must have used some non motorized wheeled wagon to transport it, than they can also dismantle bricks form some house in the town or wooden beams and transport them to the waterfall or river. If they have electricity, which it totaly looks like(even when nobody explains what creates the electricity(generators would be to loud)) then they just can emit music or record the sound of the waterfall or river and then play it 24 hours all day over the speakers to mask their noise they are making, either to build the new house near the natural sound source like the river or to live in their old house,talking to each other.

>Radios don't use sound, they use radiation.

Radios use electromagnetic waves. I assumed that they can somehow see magnetic fields and navigate with that. So if they cant sense electro magnetic waves and therefore also not magnetic fields,then we are again back at the question how do they navigate through their environment.

>They do, that appears to be how they were almost killed repeatedly, the creatures could hear them in very close proximity.

No they cant. Becuase there is this one scene with his wife where the creature is literaly standing 1 meter away from here while she is sitting in the bathtub and does not hear her breathing or hearthbeat at all. Beside of that downstairs in the flooded room with the baby...the water there is definitely not so loud that it would mask her walking through the water.

>Probably because they'd knock them over, which you might recall happened, the better question is why isn't everything at waist height on a surface? As far as more shelving, again, building things is loud.

Again they could mask any building process with playing constantly music or recorderd river or waterfall sounds.


>That's a good question, they would be hooked up to the electric grid of course, but how is electricity being generated? Generating electricity is loud, even without people to do it that would mean the creatures would be drawn there and destroy it, except for maybe a hydroelectric dam, which they could not destroy.

A hydro electric dam uses the force of gravity to power turbines which then create electricity.Electric Turbines are very loud, i visited once one.And the creatures seem to destroy everything which makes excessive noise, because it hurts their ""ears"" (thats seems to be also the main reason why they dont eat the things they kill...they just want the noise to stop). The only reason they endure the waterfall or river is that they cant destroy constantly floating or falling water, how should this work. Now you  could argue that they then also would destroy the speaker which the humans could use to play music or recorded sounds of rivers and waterfalls. But if they hear recorded sounds of waterfalls, how do they then now that it is not the real sound, if they cant see. They seem not that smart to figure that out...at least they do not act very smart through the whole movie.

>That's also a good one, their refusal to use distractions until things are dire appears to just be not wanting to rouse the creatures and have them stalking the area, also, they THINK there are only three in the area, but a sufficiently loud source could draw many, many more.

It just makes no sense nevertheless.

  
>Their creators are likely blind, I gather, we create things in our own image, including weapons.

If the creators are so smart that they can manipulate genes on that level to create such things and travel through space for light years, then they are definitely smart enough to understand the concept of electromagnetic waves (because many of the tech needed for genetics and spacetravel is build around the concept of electromagnetic waves or magnetic fields, like microscopes or mri scans or reading out the amount of light a star produces to determine how far it is away with the help of the doubler effect or triangulating stars,..all of that needs the sensing of electromagnetic waves).....sorry i just dont buy it that they have invented deep space travel and genetic manipulation on that level but do not even understand or have found out about the concept of light bounching of of stuff and that you can determin positions with that, even if they where born blind (if they have genetics on that level then they could change their own body however they want including giving them additional senses....hell even we stupid humans dream of seeing magnetic fields with our eyes, even when we do not have this feature by birth...and you are saying that a more intellegent species has not at least the same form of imagination)

Yes having a little newborn child which screams all the time uncontrolably seems to be a really good way to get killed in this world in a matter of seconds... a bit like playing russian roulett. 

They could build a soundproofed room, maybe by masking the building process of the room by playing loud music or records of rivers or waterfall sounds to mask the noise they make while building the room.And then the child would have to live the first 4-5 years basicaly in this room until he/she is smart enough to understand that he/she cant make noise(space ship boy was definitely 5 years or older and didnt understood the concept even then).

This isn't new for horror films, but most horror films that are this predictable aren't getting 95% on RT.

And if plot holes and predictability aren't enough, I really couldn't connect to these characters. I think a lot of people connect to Krasinski because of the office, but as a person who's never really watched the show, this movie didn't have enough to care for him or his family. They made very dumb decisions in this movie, another common problem in horror films. Having a kid in this world, really? I don't feel sorry for you having this happen to you then, especially as you've already seen what this world can do to your children. It's a shame because in some ways the characters live pretty smartly, but the plot only advanced in many parts of the movie simply due to dumb decisions.

What do you mean by this? There's nothing politically-incorrect about it. It's a pretty standard, inoffensive family.

Yes many movies show different kinds of families, but there's nothing that isn't ""politically correct"" in this one. 

With this being said, what is it you're even lauding here? The absence of LGBT people and minorities? The fact that Krasinski's character gets food and protects his children? Because all of these things are by far the norm in the majority of movies.

I just finished watching the movie. I thought it was made pretty clear that the monsters generate a low frequency noise themselves, which is what causes the feedback from the hearing aid and the electricity to short out when they are near by. 

Having that kind of buzzing in your own ear would drown out any sound under a certain decibel, which is why they can walk on sand but not leaves, they can make a cook fire and mask its sound by putting it in a weird location.

Ok that's just defending the other dudes point's can you kindly address a few of mine oh wise sage.

1. How did these creatures survive the force of a nuclear bomb while riding a meteor through our atmosphere? 

2. The US military already has several sound based weaponry prototypes. How were these creatures able to withstand the brilliant minds of the US military and not a deaf wonder child? 

3. How did they survive in the vacuum of space?


4. If these creatures are attracted to large sudden sounds, why not fly a couple of A-10's over them and lead them off a cliff?

5. If these creatures are attracted to large sudden sounds, why not lure them all into pits or cages and trap them? We know they will run to the fireworks, so this time we can do that in a larger area and seal the area off rapidly while there distracted and then dump them at the bottom of the ocean. 


6. Assuming they crippled mankind how are they not starving to death? It seems the entire area was devoid of any types of ground life. They must eventually starve as all organisms need some form of energy.

Don't Breathe worked with its premise because the main characters were well-developed and the story was told really well. There wasn't much storytelling at all in AQP.

Besides, I don't feel like I'm cherrypicking that much. I already said the film had no plot, it was completely bland and had no style to it. Being honest, I'd actually argue that it was really watered down. The monsters feel more like a nuiscance than a real threat because they don't actually do much in the main story. They only appear when human sounds louder than natural sounds occur. Why not have some monsters be already hiding in the crops?

dx1nk89,the power issue and living in a creaky open farmhouse are pretty obvious plot holes crucial to driving the story.,8a5qdo
dx1nhaa,"Spoon fed? no, but i like thoughtful writing. I like movies where obvious gaping plot holes are addressed during the movie setup.

for instance: the movie beautifully handles the noise of footsteps. they have paths of sand everywhere, and walk around barefoot. But they never speak of it. Where could they possibly get so much sand? Well the shot of him fishing shows a close up of him talking to his son and his hands have sand on them from the river. No dialogue needed, but simple attention to a major plot point. It grounds the world, and provides another layer of tension as they rarely like to step off the path. When he does so at the end, he take a risk stepping off to protect his family and get an axe, but the creature hears it and attacks him. Clever.

That level of thought and detail shows good writing, and an expectation of similar quality throughout the rest of the film. (like split or inception, fantastical worlds grounded in reality)

1. they need food and sand.

2. the father is experimenting with electronics with hearing aids and medical journals for ear canals. The wife has acquired an oxygen tank and created an enclosed box bassinet to keep the baby breathing while soundproofed. So yeah, they seem smart and capable enough to create a silent living space, not looking out the window during board games and dinner. 

3. This is a GAPING issue in the movie. Do you know how electricity is created? Its loud. Apparently loud is an issue in this movie, so making electricity on the farm sounds like suicide. (either diesel generators, or solar). For a movie that requires lots of constant electricity to run lights, computers, screens, and the resolution of the plot, the ""feedback"", then ABSOLUTELY this should be addressed with a simple solar panel array placed in ANY outdoor farm shot.
If they get power from the city, then power stations need people. both power stations and people make noise. So if there are enough people making power and noise, then it would be safer than the farm. 
This is actually the most simplistic and major plot hole in the film. I'm surprised you haven't picked up on it. I guess story isn't for everyone.

4. because its the first thing survival movies try to do if they are to live rather than escape. Trap or confuse the monster. (see the walking dead for a recent reference). Or make safe haven. They actually use this premise for the waterfall and the fireworks, so you know the sound confusion method had been uncovered in this world. They were still printing and circulating newspapers enmasse  when the sound was discovered as the catalyst. I would have expected that would be the FIRST thing society or individuals would have tried to keep safe. Use sound to draw away the enemy. (see any movie when they try to draw away a guard). ALso, we know the lead character understands the concept of trapping, as he sets this up with the fish trap. But NO, this one does not need to be in the movie for the premise to work. Just an obvious one.

Yep. That they are. But its the same reason that i find independence day, signs, transformers, world war z, alien 3 and the saw movies all a bit ridiculous.

Some minds continue to work while a movie is playing, and others can switch off. I'm actually a little jealous of you... it must be bliss.

Probably not, given how fast they move. Also, guns are really loud. It makes sense they would keep it as a last resort.

2) Considering their daughter led to the death of their former youngest child before the conception of the child.  Theres about a 99.9% chance that the conception happened after the invasion.  

So plot holes.

Also, electricity.  Even off the grid solar makes noise through the transformers required to convert the stored energy.  Also filling the batteries up every week or so.  Lots of noise.  And if they used generators... they would be dead within seconds.  The grid would also be nonexistent.  

Also, various militaries and police forces and corporations around the world use active threat deterrents.  Even mall and amusement park parking lots.  Its pretty common tech.  Prisons even use it.  Some vehicles use to to panic deer off the road.  Its the exact same concept, laws, engineering principles behind a feed back loop.  

Those aliens landed on a planet who has mastered sound which would of been a mistake.  The girls hearing aid tech is all around us.  They would of tried to march into a large city and been incapacitated before reaching the more densely populated areas.  

Its ridiculous to even assume that we had no idea how to stop them.  A lot of the US military vehicles travel with a sub sonic feedback loop to try to keep people away from them.

- The film doesn't show what the other 2 creatures were up to during the fireworks. Also, the fireworks are in the air, and some distance away from the farm. That largens the radius of possible area the creatures were scouring by a considerable amount 

- Your third point is unfair. You're complaining about very specific bits of logic that you don't agree with, and now you want the film to conform to your very specific idea of parental discipline, instead of another realistic portrayal over how parenting is actually like for a large portion of families in the real world? There is no right or wrong here. It's not difficult to imagine that a family living in the midst of an apocalypse and seeing their quality of life impaired by the restrictions they have to impose on themselves actually not prefer to have a military style regime in place.

- If we're talking about super specific logic, as an engineer/contractor let me tell you it is nigh impossible to build a facility providing the same living space and conditions as the one they already live in without making a noise. No welding, no hammer, no nails, no drills. Near the base of a waterfall? Where the soil is loose, and the ground is invariably uneven? Even less plausible

- I guess John Krasinski was willing to risk it all for Emily Blunt

Or at least being extra conscious that there's a nail in that spot. They couldn't have not known it was there. They literally painted that spot on the step. 

The reason this in particular bothers me is because there's a spot on the floor in the house I'm living in where the laminate flooring is a little buckled up and starting to splinter. I only noticed the splintering because my sock got caught on it when I was walking, and I didn't hesitate after that to cover that shit up with several layers of tape until it could be dealt with, because I didn't want to run the risk of forgetting about it, stepping on that spot the wrong way, and getting a good chunk of splintered flooring stuck in my foot. Admittedly, my solution wasn't the most elegant thing, but those are the lengths I went to in order to solve what could have been a potentially painful problem in the future. And I don't live in a world where monsters will come rip you to pieces at the slightest bit of noise. So this plot point is either contrived in that the characters knew about this potential issue and didn't deal with it because they're idiots, or they had no idea and it's just an overly (in)convenient setup for advancing the plot. Why not just set it up so that Emily Blunt actually notices the nail and goes to get a hammer or something to deal with it? Meanwhile, the daughter, angry at her father, makes a character decision to defy him and go into the basement anyway, thus stepping on the nail (because she's never been down there and doesn't know about it) and setting into motion the rest of the plot. It'd still be a little contrived but at least it'd be motivated by character development rather than convenience just to get the plot moving.",8a5qdo

1) How do they distinguish a human making a noise vs, say, a pinecone falling off of a tree.

Or are they just in a constant state and running back and forth towards every little noise in a forest?

2) How is any animal still alive after a year if there are so many of these monsters running around killing everything that makes a little noise? And how is the ecosystem still alive and well if there are mass extinctions from these monsters? If supposedly our whole ecosystem would collapse from the extinction bees, imagine almost every animal.

Also, it's not really forced. The girl has no idea what is going on with her device. She turns it off. He sacrifices himself and they make it to the house where it all starts to make sense. Knowing her father loves her, she is no longer being difficult. She reads what is on the whiteboard, sees all of the hearing devices her father has spent time poring over and it all lines up. She is able to save her entire family. If he doesn't do that then none of that happens.

dxh68ov,"My thoughts exactly. The movie had its problems here and there but for the most part I thought it was told smartly and had a lot to say while almost none of it was spoken. It was a big concept but told very tighly and with a small scope. I really enjoyed it.

I also liked that all the characters were pretty smart for the most part. In a lot of horror movies you end up yelling at the screen because people are doing the dumbest stuff and getting themselves killed. But the stuff they do in this movie to survive is pretty brilliant honestly. I know I probably wouldn't have lasted as long as they did...

Random thought, I was telling my husband after it was over that the hardest thing about this apocalypse was that every dog probably had to die. Because there's no way our dog would not bark at a big beast coming for it. And we'd all be dead because of it lol. RIP all dog owners",8a5qdo

The second time (first time for her) she's fighting for her and her brother's life and also has no idea what's going on outside. It's also night and she can't see very well -- the difference between the monster leaping away because it's in pain and leaping away because it's heard something else is probably impossible to distinguish. For all she knows, somebody set off more fireworks outside as a distraction and that's why the monster went tearing through the silo. The noise from her hearing aid would be completely incidental at that point. The third time for the audience (second time for her) she can see the monster more clearly and also isn't trying to avoid dying in a grain silo with almost no light.

The second time it happened in the Silo, no one, not even an adult,  would have been able to put two and two together if they are hearing for the very first times in their lives, and it's very painful and at a time of high stress/life or death. 
I'm sure you have seen the 'Hearing for the first time' videos on other social media sites.

dx17rcb,"Most corn silo accidents occur because of moving grain and or unstable slopes of grain.  The silo in the film was completely still (no grain was falling out at the bottom) and it was completely flat, and at the most stable position.

So pick and choose which train of logic you want, the film is inconsistent in both of them.",8a5qdo

The only way they would sink is if there was a ton of rotten grain that would have broken underneath them, but it still wouldn't have sucked them down like shown in the film. 

Being a farmer and knowing this did take me out of the film a tad. I'm sure they figured most people wouldn't know the difference, but I do know, and non flowing grain doesn't act like quicksand. ",8a5qdo
dxecypz,Deaf people make noise too...,8a5qdo
dx16q7c,"Uh, how about you read that more thoroughly yourself?  Grain entrapment occurs when there is a large mountain of grain on the opposite wall of the silo and you're standing on the lower ground.  Then, by some reason be it a stray vibration or impact, the mountain of grain becomes unstable and it FALLS ONTO THE WORKER in an avalanche.  You are buried by the grain, you don't sink into it like it's air.  This is why workers are able to even go into a grain silo in the first place.  Think about it.  If merely stepping onto the grain causes you to sink into it, why go into it in the first place?  That is surely to be inviting death.



And I understood the final scene too.  That made sense.  Which is why I didn't critique it anywhere in my post.",8a5qdo
dx16zqp,Grain entrapment is a thing but when only the kiddos were subjected to it is where the inconsistency comes from. Why was the monster not also submerged or at least shown to have difficulty moving in the corn? They could have had a more suspensful encounter with the monster if it was flailing around trying to keep itself above the grain while the kids are still trying to be silent/keep themselves above the corn.,8a5qdo
dx1d4a7,"Uhh I farm for a living, and what was shown in the film is not accurate. I go in grain bins to shovel and level off the top of the grain all the time. 

If the grain isn't flowing then, no, you are not going to sink into it like quicksand. Grain Bins can be extremely dangerous if there is flowing grain, but the grain in the film was completely still.",8a5qdo
dx1790x,"Uh, like I mentioned in my post, explosives do not kill mainly because of shrapnel, they kill because of the LETHAL AND EXPLOSIVE SHOCKWAVE EMANATING FROM THE BLAST.  Shockwaves travel through all matter, unimpeded and will royally fuck up anything soft and squishy.  In the same vein, bullet shockwaves are imparted through the body even if stopped by something like kevlar body armor.  And, like I also mentioned.  Heat royally fucks up soft and squishy things too.  So if you can't hit it accurately with a gun, just spray and pray with a flamethrower.  Also, like I said, most heavy duty rifles are fired from a decent distance away.  This means that if there are monsters in your range that haven't detected you yet, you can snipe them out before they even move in.  They're blind too so they'll mostly focus on enemies in front of them anyway.



If I had to come up with a strategy to beat them myself, I would put a front line of tanks armed with flame throwers, machine guns, bayonets, and sirens.  These tanks will blare an oppressively loud noise and will effectively drown out any other sound made by soldiers.  The monsters will solely target these tanks.  In the film, the creatures had trouble puncturing a simple truck roof so they can't hope to puncture an armored tank.  Flames will will roast any creature that stays on the tank for too long.  Bayonets stabbed from the tank vents will occasionally land a lucky strike between face plates.  Machine guns will not beat armor, but the bullet shockwaves will still cause damage.  The middle line will have infantry trying to be as quiet as possible, but have flamethrowers and auto rifles as well.  They will not make sounds louder than the tank so they have more or less free reign.  Some will inevitably be unlucky and hit by the the chaos but they will not be instantly wiped out.  Then we have the backline of highly trained marksman (we have a lot of those you know).  They are in charge of taking opportunity shots at anything staying still long enough to be hit.



I came up with this strategy with no military training at all.  An expert in strategy will obviously come up with a method 100x as effective as me.  And we have entire teams of them in our military.

dxdqc4b,The monsters focus their hearing on single stimuli. We see this with the pan in shot of the alien ear with an echo to whatever they were listening to.

dxdh0cv,"So I saw it last night, and honestly, I'm glad they did this. It took away the movie being about the monster and instead being about the family. For instance, in Signs, the entire movie was about not seeing the monster until the very end, and then the weakness is some weird quirk the girl has that doesn't really make sense (I know about the supposed thing with the mom, still doesn't make sense). Here the weakness is believable and doesn't require stretching the character who discovers it into somethings she's not, in fact it relies very much on who she is.

And since the monsters were just there, we didn't have a movie that was about what's the mosnter, how do we fight it. Instead we have a movie about we're a family and how do we stay a family when things get impossible. And we see that story play out. The monsters were incidental in this movie and by exposing them instead of hiding them it made that clearer. 

Of course that seems counterintuitive, but if they were constantly hidden, or just a shadow the question of the moview would be, what are they, instead of the question being for the family, who are we?

dxh4tzu,"*The monster's armour withstands bombs.*
Hmmm.. But not a broken ass hearing aide and a farmer John shotgun? mmk.

*Who would think to do that without reading the script?*
Probably because the front cover of the NY Times or whatever clippings in his basement in the beginning of the movie were about how they have ultra sensitive hearing. If we can create devices to prevent dogs from pissing on lawns with high frequencies we could probably figure something out here. NOT TO MENTION all of the crazy frequencies our everyday technology is creating already. It'd be a insufferable environement for these monsters the second they showed up. Again CANNOT EVEN HANDLE A BROKEN ASS HEARING AIDE.

*It's very irresponsible. How is that a plot hole? It doesn't break logic or continuity. There's a clear motivation for the pregnancy.*
Umm... what would that be? Especially from a family that is as exceedingly cautious as this family appears to be. Doesn't change my point that they could easily prevent pregnancy with a couple of ""her pleasures"".

*stick to Disney or Marvel.*
Eat one bro. Not my kind of flicks.

*Being deaf is a severe handicap in a world where making noise gets you killed. That father's top priority was to protect his children. There's no reason to believe she was completely deaf, only that Lee doesn't know how to build a hearing aide.*
Maybe go loot some hearing aides like you do everything else. Also why the hell are they bringing a 4 year old on a mission like that in the first place!? S-T-U-P-I-D.

*Again. Booms boxes break. They also usually need to be activated manually.* 
Yes they break, but if the monster is there to break it then they served their purpose....and no they don't. You've heard of a remote control right? Maybe some batteries?  

*So basically you're suggesting people just play music to tell the monster where they are. Earlier you suggested luring them onto a rocket, but I assumed you were kidding.*
You really failed to comprehend what I was saying bud. You lure to a DESIRED LOCATION with the boom box, and then blast them from a DIFFFERENT LOCATION with a [ROCKET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher)... I do not assume you are kidding because you are acting fairly dense.

*You could argue they could build some kind of PA system, and I would ask you where they would get the skills or resources to do any of that?*
Again , I'm sure you could find a speaker system,  boom box, whatever in this apocalyptic existence. Society leaves things behind, no need to build everything, simply identify where it would be and go get it. But I'll humor you, let's pretend that there are absolutely no boom boxes, speakers, amplifiers on the planet anymore to loot. This dad is trying to cure deafness in his basement. I'm sure he could wire a speaker cone to a power source and build one. It's incredibly basic.

*He was bleeding out with ribs sticking out of his chest. If he created a diversion that didn't get him killed he'd risk his kids trying to rescue him at their own peril. He was keeping a promise to his wife. Again this isn't a plot hole. There's a clear explanation for his action and motivation and logic and continuity are preserved.*

OK Fair, I didn't see his rib sticking out. But he's definitely going to die screaming like that, his wife I believe was a doctor, maybe she could have helped? Definitely not now. You can distract these things with a freaking egg timer! Why commit suicide like that?

*Ok, who's going to build it?*
I'm sure there are plenty of modern houses available... you know structures that have already been built?

*Nothing you've listed here meets the definition of a plot hole. A plot hole is something that breaks logic or continuity.*
The whole movie defies logic because almost everything they do is illogical. It's counter intuitive.

*It's one thing to say you didn't like something about a movie, and that's just your opinion. But if you're claiming what you listed above are holes in the plot then that claim is false.*

 In the same way that in a sci-fi or horror film you can't write a really sloppy solve for the conclusion of the story.

Also, there’s no need to resort to personal insults about “bad taste”. Grow up and respond to me when you’re ready to have a constructive conversation and grasp the idea of the word “opinion” instead of throwing around insults like a child. 

Finally, the idea that they were “sad, desperate etc” as reasoning for having a baby during an apocalypse, especially one where you die just by making the slightest sound, is just so ignorant. There was no reason for them to be so sybaritic as to completely ignore the facts, a child is loud, giving birth is loud, there was no way they could’ve gone through that situation without something going wrong. Any rational human being could see it was the wrong thing to do, and if there was a mishap such as an accidental pregnancy there are plenty of options to prevent that. I’m not saying that it’s easy to be sangfroid in an apocalyptic situation, but common sense just doesn’t go out the window. The point is, it made absolutely no sense. I might be persnickety, this might not bother most people, but it’s a big deal for me which is why it’s a huge part of my dislike for the movie.

* Did the monster tried to break waterfall? If they already know that they can't stop waterfall noise, then they would not come for waterfall noise. Be it from real waterfall or a speaker. 

* Pregnant women can just do chores near waterfall if they decided to live near it. 

* it does not make sense to not ever live near waterfall. Waterfall can eliminate ALL problems in the movie.

dxaeayx,"I don’t really appreciate the tone of your comment. It’s not fair to just assume that I must’ve fallen asleep or didn’t pay attention. I fucking love movies. They’re my only hobby. I definitely gave it the attention it deserves.  I think the fact that I had so much to say, good or bad, shows that I care enough to have some sort of discussion. 

I’ll concede that there might be more to the characters than I gave it credit for. But *for me* I just don’t think enough time was spent on them to actually convey in a tangible way their depth. Or at least in a meaningful way. 

Your point about any film can be reduced to a sentence, I inherently disagree with. There’s a difference between plot and concept. For almost any film, yes, you could explain the concept in a sentence. But plot is the actual story and path it takes. Point A to B so on. With the films you listed you cannot describe the plot in just a sentence. With A Quiet Place the plot is just that simple. I certainly don’t consider plot depth a “litmus test” for great films. If I did then my entire original post would have just been focused on plot. But it wasn’t so don’t twist things to suggest something I never suggested. 

Most of the jump scares were justified? The raccoon falling off the roof? Emily Blunt’s hand hitting the window? Krasinski grabbing his daughter when she’s about to go into the basement? The brother grabbing his sisters arm when she reached for the flashlight? To be clear I don’t have a problem with jump scares as a concept and believe they can absolutely be used effectively. However a jump scare that is accompanied with extremely harsh loud music is cheap because it’s not actually relying on the content to scare you but rather an unexpected awfully loud stinger. 

With my comment regarding Krasinski’s performance, I’d say that he just isn’t given an opportunity to really just act. He spends a majority of the film starting wide eyed at someone/something. Blunt on the other hand is given quite a few scenes to really get some range and go places and outclasses Krasinski in the scenes where they’re sharing the same emotions. I actually thought he gave a better performance in 13 Hours. 

I don’t think one would have to ignore large parts of the screenplay in order for my criticisms to make sense. If anything they more come down to personal preference than anything. For example my comment about how I could tell I was watching a film directed by someone who doesn’t have a distinctive voice with their direction. And what you said about why people are downvoting me, that’s not what that’s for. It’s to downvote people who aren’t contributing or are being overly offensive. And to endorse the former is wrong. 

",8a5qdo
dxa535q,"That’s fine. I never said anyone who liked it is wrong to. I just simply had too many problems and I wish I liked it as much as most people. 

What’s interesting is I don’t think any of my criticisms are too harsh or invalid but for whatever reason people really dislike my comment. I’m more interested in why these things weren’t a problem for some people rather than just be quietly downvoted for going against the grain. ",8a5qdo
dxa6xw1,"That’s fine if that’s what I sound like but that is my honest opinion on the film. I mentioned it before in a different comment, but I recognize I’m focusing more on the negatives than the positives because I think it provides a more interesting, dynamic discussion. It’s not me being “different.” I find it interesting that you have a hard time believing someone might actually not like this movie as much as most. Film is subjective. No hostility was meant to come from my comment but we *should* be able to freely talk about a popular film’s faults without worrying about people questioning if it’s a genuine opinion. 

I don’t really have a good answer for this. I just feel we don’t really get to see other sides to him that would give him some sort of dimension. But like I said, having characters that are archetypes isn’t a bad thing, but typically when a film does choose to have archetypes for characters there will be other aspects that are more fleshed out or presented better than what the film does so it just simply didn’t work for me.

Edit: to add to this I’ll say look at Greek mythology. Those are stories filled with archetypes because those stories aren’t about the characters, they’re about the themes, ideas, and morals. You aren’t supposed to focus on the characters. However with A Quiet Place, from what I can tell, it’s a story about the characters. So having archetypes in a film where the characters *are* the focus doesn’t really work for me because I’m wondering why I should care about these people that I don’t really know too much about.

dxa69kx,I don’t see why I have less of a right to post my opinion than anyone else in this thread. This movie isn’t bad. I had some strong positive points that I stated. But in a thread like this I think the more interesting discussion will come from an opinion that’s against the grain. Otherwise it’s an echo chamber. No film is without flaws. For some this film has very few and for others it has multiple. Critical discussion is a healthy part of film. It helps us see things from a different perspective. I’m perfectly willing to hear someone out who disagrees with my points of contention if it means I’ll have a better understanding or appreciation of the film. But people seem more interested in either quietly downvoting or making jokes because it’s easier than just having a conversation about it. ,8a5qdo

dxk2xhl,"I agree with almost everything you said, but I want to bolster one of your points and disagree with another one of your points.

First of all, the truck. The alien could easily have cut open the truck, but instead it got on top of the truck and started stabbing it. It does the same to the silo door. I think there's room to assume the monster doesn't realize there are people in the truck or under the silo door. I think it just heard a noise and started stabbing whatever was in the general vicinity. 

I think a lot of people are being willfully ignorant about the screenplay. There are definitely a couple of plot holes, but most people are just ignoring events in the film to justify their criticism. I have to agree that the sound design and the score were easily the worst executed parts of the movie. I didn't notice it too much on first viewing, but on second viewing there are just a lot of scenes that would've been more tense in silence, but there's some music in the background. The loud jump scare noises were kind of obnoxious as well. I'd have preferred a more natural noise if they had to do anything.

By sound design I meant creepy sounds coming from behind/above you. Which should've been done for this move in particular.

They can build simple barriers like walling up their front door and only coming/going via smaller entrances. Instead they did nothing and monsters just waltz in. Remember they are blind so blocking their path is trivial. Again, they can't just bust through any barrier.

Just think about what you would do when you had plenty of resources and time. You'd just live your normal life and not make any sounds? Which is what these people did.",8a5qdo

Then the parent sneak off somewhere to have quiet sex and can’t be bothered to use protection? Having another mout to feed is the answer to survival? Then they set up home in the middle of quiet country? Why not a high rise apartment away from the ground based monsters? They have a sound proof room but don’t live in the room? The river and waterfall offer limitless protection yet they choose not to simply live on the river? Girl is adamant that she not be able to hear yet is upset she can’t forage in the dangerous wilderness? Girl hates being treated as a child and then immediately acts petulant and abandons her pregnant mother? Mother feels the laundry bag caught on something and aggressively yanks on the bag turning up the nail? Again quiet is key but let’s hang framed pictures and other shit everywhere where it can fall and make noise? Easy peasy 15 minute child birth? Monster tares the pipes and there is rushing water everywhere; indoor plumbing systems continue to function in an apocalypse? Same with electricity or is there some sort of silent generator powering everything? Father saves wife and new baby, completely forgets about other children? Father says kids will know what to do, yet son immediately leaves the firework launch point and girl casually strolls home despite seeing the rocket? Lights hung everywhere but no attempt to build a barrier around home or other noise making distractions besides a single firework? Kids drowning in grain silo but big ass monster does not and then moments later kids escape easily? Dad stands screaming to provide about a 2 second distraction instead of running away screaming?

dyo3ttw,"I disagree.  One of the things that made the film's concept creative and interesting to me was that our protagonists' main defense in most monster/thriller movies - guns - was rendered completely useless.  Yes, the idea of gunfire attracting attention also shows up in many zombie movies/shows, but even then you'll see the protagonists using guns all the time.

Here, I think it was a pointed decision to not feature guns at all until the end.  At first, watching the opening scene, I wondered ""Well why aren't they armed?  At least as a last defense?""  Then the movie does a good job of showing us that, even as a last defense, shooting a gun means you're completely fucked, because every creature within miles will be on you.

Thus, using the gun at the end to finish off the monster was part of the cathartic feeling the ending was going for.  ""We can finally fight back now.""  It's also the reason for the shotgun rack at the very end that some people have criticized as cliche.  I think it's actually thematically on point. ",8a5qdo

dyo0ol4,"Completely disagree.  In fact, I think your suggestion provides a ""total lack of payoff.""  The movie needed a resolution.  An hour and a half of running from monsters and then just dying is not the makings of a good movie imo.  And it's super appropriate that you brought up Metalhead, because that is exactly how I would describe that episode (and I hated it.  worst BM episode by far).  Metalhead gave you no reason to care about the protagonists, the monsters, or anything that happened in the episode.  Oh they did all that just to get a toy for a sick kid?  Why do I give a fuck?  Who is this kid?  Why do I care about these people dying anyway?  

The ending gave this film a proper resolution.  The characters were developed, and their story had a purpose.  They know the monsters' weakness, and they are going to be able to fight back.  After so long living in perpetual fear of even making a noise, they finally have a reason to feel confident again, even in the face of the extreme odds against monsters we've been shown to be especially vicious and effective.

So instead of the gun shooting the hard armor on the outside, it got into the body beneath it.

I get that they wanted the gut-wrenching death and the moment of her finding the hearing aids, but throughout the film a lot of the conflict between them is pretty manufactured. It would have been enough to just show she felt he blamed her for her brothers death, without adding silly conflicts that could have been resolved with a few words.",8a5qdo

Unlikely but a thought",8a5qdo
dxbp7te,"Hmm, I took it completely differently. There was the scene when the dad brought her a new version of the hearing aid that he made and she didn't even want to try it. He kept insisting and she kept insisting that it wouldn't work and never would.

We also learn from the brother that she blames herself for what happened to the youngest brother and he asked the dad if he loved her. And told the dad he should tell her that he does. Then he does tell her that he loves her and always has when he sacrifices himself to save the children.

Finally, at the end the girl finally goes into the basement and sees all of the other hearing aids he was working on. When that happened, I thought that he had always told her not to go down there so she wouldn't see that he had alway kept trying to improve it so she would be able to hear. He knew she didn't want him to try because she didn't think it would ever work. But he would always persist anyway with hope that he would eventually be able to make her hear. I felt like when she went down at the end, she really realized and believed that he did, in fact, love her and did not blame her for the brother's death.",8a5qdo
dxds1ds,What's your interpretation?,8a5qdo

dxe13ki,"It looks like they lived there already since the upstairs of the house had the younger son's room intact without any sound-proofing done. I think the movie was smart in showing that this particular family had the abilities and the resources to survive. Because their daughter is deaf they're already used to communicating silently, and because they live in the middle of nowhere they're probably less at risk than the cities which were probably decimated. If I were a father with three kids already living in a rural home with these strange creatures we know nothing about except the bits and pieces that trickle in from the news hunting everyone down, the last thing I would do is venture out into the unknown trying to find an ideal place to set up base that may or may not exist.",8a5qdo

dwybztn,"I can see where you're coming from, but they'd gone 98 days on their quiet system without an incident and then a further 374 days without incident as well. Since this occurred over the course of one single day it'd be kind of hard for me to believe that human mistakes that had been avoided for hundreds of days suddenly just started occurring repeatedly on this one specific day. I kind of like the fact that one major mistake snowballed into such a cluster-fuck, gives you a sense of just how potent these creatures are and just how careful they've had to be for so long.",8a5qdo

I love that they *didn't* go that route - another horror movie based on the characters making bad decisions - do we really want that to drive the drama?",8a5qdo
dwze6iu,"I feel like that walks a thin line though. Like if the film was half human mess ups and half the terrifying sound creatures, alot of people (myself included) would have spent the end of the film thinking ""Damn its amazing these people survived 450+ days fucking up this much""",8a5qdo
dxbccfj,"Really?  I felt like there was a lot of that.  For a 90 minute movie, I thought anymore of these situations and it would've felt like they got away with it too often.

* The toy rocket getting knocked off the shelf
* The son activating the toy rocket (obviously didn't get away with that one)
* The nail initially catching the bag
* Evelyn stepping on the nail
* The lantern being knocked down
* The son falling through the top of the silo
* The water leak",8a5qdo
dwwbq1f,"I really want to watch this one again before I determine my definitive opinion on it for that reason. I was fully caught up in the suspense and tension the whole way through, which is a really good thing, but looking back there are a few things story-wise that may be a bit off. It wouldn't affect my opinion by much, but I'd like to see it again just already knowing what happens to see how that affects my enjoyment of the film.",8a5qdo
dx9gew7,If there were more human mess ups it would have just gotten annoying though. Like they were a good level of smart but still making mistakes. Any more mistakes and it would have been the tired cliche of characters being stupider than they really would be just for the plot,8a5qdo

All indications is that it was swift. 3 months in, it was a ghost town. It can cause major operational issues if your feet on the ground are being slaughtered when they step outside. Many military operations have been foiled by guerrilla warfare. Amongst all that chaos it can be hard to ascertain that it’s sound.

dx09kmq,"Depends. If these things came swiftly in the night, what can you do? They are extremely fast, strong, and armored. Far more suited to navigating hostile terrain. Picking up their location isn’t exactly easy. Catching a live animal requires tranqs or traps. And their skin is too tough to tranq. Gases may be ineffective. Trapping would have been the best option. But if this invasion was too quick and wide scale, you have a short window for determining that they are sensitive to sound and exploiting it. Not only that, but most people that notice that it is sound are in a position where they are about to die. And until it’s understood that it’s sound, which requires some level of tranquility in the area to recognize sound was the trigger, everyone is freaking the fuck out. So it’s unlikely that amongst all the initial chaos, artillery, and gunfire, that it was recognized. It won’t quiet down until the situation stabilizes, for better or worse, and it’s only in that environment that an observation and ascertaining would be made.

He just happened to discover it by accident with the hearing aid amplifier. The other thing is that the monsters move fast and could not be contained in metal or cement, and trying to kill them with guns would cause an overrun, etc. etc. So how were the scientists/military supposed to capture a monster for testing and then protect themselves as they played different sounds to it?",8a5qdo

Based on that I suspect this corn was planted in the summer (not that it matters). The corn would have died in the wintertime being covered in snow. The stalks would weaken and fall. If untreated or removed, they would sit as a layer to which one could remove the corn but not without making a lot of noise from the rustling. He could have planted each bit of corn by hand and plowed it by hand. That would be extremely time consuming and would have made a bit of noise. At which point I would ask myself, why would he risk planting more corn than the family needed? A small plot would have been fine...

BUT, the corn looked extremely healthy, regularly watered and planted by machine. You can tell by how well it was planted with zero decaying stalks on the ground.

dwx49wh,"That was *one* time, and she'd already had it go off apparently randomly. She probably thought it was just a bug in the hearing aid itself. Frankly she was pretty smart to realize it the third time it went off in their presence. ",8a5qdo

dx1cgym,"It doesn't happen THAT much to me, to be fair. The last time it happened was during The Greatest Showman where a group of friends kept talking to each other about the most random, pointless shit, treating it like a reunion or sth, and also kept giggling whenever a song started. It was quite an empty theatre too. I think it was because when I watched it, it was quite early after the movie started playing in my country – like it was only one week later that everyone went crazy for it and the radio started playing the songs, and people who weren't interested in musicals started getting curious about it, etc – so maybe they went into the theatre not expecting A MUSICAL and found it amusing that people started breaking into song and dance in the middle of a conversation or sth.

I guess it wasn't that long ago but I watched several movies after that but didn't experience anything more like that before this, and overall I didn't find that experience as annoying as this one, since the whole quiet thing is such a big element of the movie.",8a5qdo

dwz6tvj,"I feel like, you're probably right. But given how well organized their family is and that they've lasted that long while it seems pontentially millons of others haven't would raise the stakes to the point where these sort of mistakes get weeded out real quick. Maybe they've never seen the monsters, it's definitely possible. I just didn't get that vibe from how organized they were. Plus again, his celebration of the noise and raising the toy in the air or whatever was an odd reaction to such a serious moment.",8a5qdo
dwza0wx,"That was reasonable, the kid still wanting them after his parents stopped him and knowing he could die from taking it in particular with the batteries in them is the dumb part. Also his reaction to it going off, he should be frightened to death, instead he does this awkward ass arm raise like he's celebrating his inevitable death.

dx091so,"It’s cute you think that! I can tell you’ve never had a baby and if, on the slightly off chance that you have, then it was a chill as fuck baby, 

I, however have had two. One was fairly normal. Ate well, slept well, breastfed on demand. Wasn’t made to sleep alone. He cried at least a few times a day. It’s their only way of communicating. They use their voice when they feel they need to. The crying with my normal baby usually didn’t last very long as I was able to soothe him quickly and he was easily sated. 

The second child was breastfed, worn by me as often as possible and when not, was held by me all the time (if she wasn’t being held she was wailing). She also refused to not only sleep alone but had to sleep ON ME, even for naps. Every need was met by me, her extremely attentive, stay at home mom whose main focus was her, as she simply didn’t want to be touched by anyone but me for the first few weeks. Not even dad. 

And that baby CRIED. And cried. And cried. For no discernible reason. We tried to alleviate possible acid reflux. No dice. Eliminated all dairy from my diet. No dice. We tried everything we could think of and nope. She cried when I held her and she cried as she woke up every hour, even though I breastfed her anytime she wanted. She just cried. For three months straight. Now, she’s 4 and I know her and I get why she cried. She’s a little spitfire. I love that about her. She has no chill. And it makes sense now. 

But again, it’s cute that you think babies can be kept quiet if your idea of what their needs are are being met. Good luck with that should you ever procreate!",8a5qdo

The TV's, the Fireworks, the Racoon, the woman the man was burying. I think the latter's the most essential evidence of this, they didn't eat her. Nor did they eat the boy. They just murdered her, gruesomely - there's a grisly peripheral shot of her spilled intestines.

dx1ep73,"We don't actually know that they only focus on the loudest noise. If they did, why aren't they permanently chomping at the bit at the base of the waterfall?

My interpretation of these creatures given their insanely sensitive hearing is that they can ""see"", just not in a way we can comprehend as our entire species is biased towards optical sight. The brains of these creatures are intepreting the sound input they hear and creating some kind of map for them to navigate with, just as our brains intepret visual input from our eyes and create images for us to navigate with.

So, in places where it's naturally quieter (a la the setting of this film), loud noises are obviously going to attract them more than anything else as they represent an abnormality on their very incomplete mental map, but they're not bothered by the waterfall because that's an already established landmark on said map.

In a city, the abundance of sound allows them to create very complete maps very quickly and then isolate the variable sounds and focus in on those. We're talking about creatures that presumably evolved for millions of years with nothing but hearing to guide them. Their brains *must* have a unique way of intepreting that input in an easily usable way for them.

Here's another way to think of it. I live in Seattle. If I see a guy wearing nothing but a pink speedo and black leather trenchcoat walking down the street one day, it's not likely to warrant a significant amount of my attention. I've seen countless crazy getups out in public during my time living here. But if I see the same person walking down the road near my parents' house in the middle of nowhere, rural Eastern Washington - it's gonna turn my head real fucking quick.",8a5qdo

I husband asked them to stop in a more strongly worded way and the guy started to argue with him, until my husband threatened to bring in an usher. It’s crazy. 

It makes so unbelievably mad. I refuse to believe full grown adults somehow didn’t ever get to memo that you’re supposed to be fucking quiet during a performance. These people are probably the same ones that hover pee in public toilets so they leave spray on the seats, so their precious butts don’t touch the seat. These are probably the same assholes that hide their sample cups on shelves at the grocery store. I bet they pour coffee out into the trash hole instead of just asking for room for cream. They probably abandon their grocery cart in the parking lot so it dings your car. I fucking hate these fucking people. ",8a5qdo

The scenario you pitch would need a massive network of transportation and communication. In a scenario where you pretty much are hunted as soon as sound it made is insane. It must have been a bloodbath when the creatures first debuted.

The same limitation can exist for lower frequencies.

You didn't come off strong at all, and I appreciate that you actually had a valid reason for your opinion, unlike all the edgelords in this thread. I like digging in too, and this is one of the more satisfying *discussions* I've actually had on this thread.

I think our difference of opinion stems from this reading, because to me I never read that he blamed his daughter for what happened. The daughter blamed herself, and being a child she's unable to keep from projecting that self-loathing to everyone else. 

Every character blamed themselves for rocketkid's death. The boy's fever is the reason they went to the store. Mom could've carried the boy. Dad could've prevented everything. Daughter enabled him. But rocketkid's death was a realization for the parents that they needed to do more to prepare their children to survive without them. His over protectiveness was not out of resentment, but fear and the desire to avoid feeling helpless in the face of another child's death, something the daughter was too young and guilt-ridden to understand. Therein lies the key flaws of bother characters.

We see how much effort dad puts into keeping her safe and happy. He keeps her out of the basement for her own safety, and he keeps her from the river because it'll confirm the functionality of the hearing aide, which the audience is lead to believe can't be tested without attracting the monsters. He doesn't want to kill her hope by eliminating any plausible deniability. 

In the end there's nothing else dad can do to protect his child but give his life and trust her to carry on what he taught her. The daughter realizes that her father loved her all along and she took that for granted. Ultimately, the malfunctional hearing aide is what saves everyone else's life. This is an allegory for how parents don't always give their children the help they want, but rather they give them the help they need. And like most children that take a parent's love for granted, she doesn't realize until it's too late. She never needed redemption for getting her brother killed. She needed redemption for letting her guilt allow her to reject her father's love. And unlike most children that lose a parent, she gets an opportunity to do just that. ",8a5qdo

Firstly, there's three kids, so it's difficult to *always* think about all three of them. On top of that, their attention is focussed on the boy who's sick and who literally needs to be carried around. And finally, the daughter is significantly old enough for the parents to expect that she'll take care of her younger brother. 

Yes, they messed up. But, then we shouldn't take the moral upper hand simply because we have the power of hindsight. 

Also, there's a difference between something like Disneyland and the *specific* post apocalyptic scenario they're in. There are very few humans (or even animals, apparently) for miles around - so nothing to be afraid of there. The aliens won't attack them unless they make a sound, which is highly unlikely, given how carefully they live. And because (evidently) there hasn't been a significant attack on them for quite some time (and the fact that you can't live in fear of your life every minute and every day), they are complacent enough to be a little lax about security, which is impossible at a crowded place like Disneyland, irrespective of when you go.

Nobody else seemed to have the desire to speak up and teach them a lesson, it was her time to shine. If someone doesn't do it, they will learn that this is acceptable behavior-- and the mother (chaperone?) clearly had no desire to herd these cats.

She had a great force behind her voice, as I could hear it from across the now-busied room. (Not quite verbatim) ""You all needed to be quiet. What you did was incredibly disrespectful. You've ruined this experience for everybody here who paid _their own_ money to experience it."" They gave the typical _I have no argument, so I'll just made immature noises_ response, and claimed they weren't even being loud. This only served to piss people off, as several others took it as an opportunity to pounce on them.

I couldn't help but compare the treatment of these monsters to the Xenomorphs in Alien and Aliens. Both films have strange monster logic (they grow enormous in just a few hours without food, they know how to cut the power to the colonist facility, and the one from Alien arbitrarily decides not to kill Ripley at the end with no clear reason), yet they are scary, and not just because of their design. The don't appear at all in the first 30-40 minutes of both movies, and when they do finally appear it's terrifying because the audience has been forced to imagine what will happen for pretty much the whole of the first act.

I give A Quiet Place a pass because I think even the casual viewer can tell the movie wasn't really about the monsters. It was about the family and about being a parent. But the decision to show the monster so early made the movie less *horror* and more *thriller*.",8a5qdo

They normally ONLY Happen when you have grain actively being removed from a bin (at the bottom) and you have people walking around on it to keep it flowing consistently. This is banned at large facilities, but small farms do all kinds of stuff OSHA would shit a brick over, and if a bridge of corn forms and suddenly collapses the high rate of flow causes the particles to perform more like a liquid.

The height of the silo, the good condition of the corn and the very small volume they would have removed from the silo over time make this circumstance in the movie basically impossible.",8a5qdo
dzzw52y,"It's weird to me that you linked the grain entrapment page, and didn't read it.

Grain entrapment happens when grain is flowing, or has void spaces below it because it has flowed in the past and the corn formed a compression bridge, and that prevented all the grain from flowing down, and then someone walks on it and it collapses the bridge and corn is flowing again.

That corn wasn't flowing, and the corn in that silo is like in perfect condition, which is not how corn bridges. It gets crusty, and because of the crustiness it's able to bridge. When the corn isn't crusty it flows too well. The level of corn in the silo never dropped...

I don't know I guess the implication is that they had been removing grain from the silo, and they only took enough to create a tiny void... which somehow formed a bridge over a very small void big enough to create flowing grain conditions for long enough to almost entrap two kids, and then it stopped...

But that silo is at least 100 feet tall. That means the small void that would account for 30 seconds of flow would be somehow close enough to the top that the bridge would be disrupted by a small 60 pound kid falling into the grain.... which means the grain for the silo flowed well all the way 100 feet up and then spontaneously formed a tiny void 10 feet from the top?

This is just ABSOLUTELY NOT HOW GRAIN ENTRAPMENT WORKS.

Personally, I feel it would have worked better if it ended on the family leaving the farm together with the dead daughter leading them, paralyzing the monsters as they run past them. It would have been a better contrast to the rest of the movie since they were the ones always running away, and are now running towards them with no fear.

I'm not even trying to be argumentative or anything but those two instances I mentioned were story altering moments that made no sense given the information we had about the monsters. 

They would have been able to hear the baby and kill all in the basement, John K. and the kids should have been able to stay as they were in that fight scene without the monster randomly finding his position. 

Inconsistencies with the nature of the monster.

Also, when the kids were in the silo, they were pushing against the metal to defend from the monster but somehow weren't sinking in the corn anymore.

There's just tons of tiny things that really just seem like lack of attention to detail imo.

dxnkj6q,"I'm not saying they would never leave, but as it is their entire world is within walking distance anyways. Just shift the center of that to the most secure place they have. The house only works as a shelter against the elements, it's absolutely not a defense against the monsters that can rip through the silo like it's not there. No matter what inconveniences they'd have to put up with and little luxuries they'd have to give up, the waterfall is the best shelter they have. 

They have time, the new waterfall shelter doesn't need to pop up in a day. They walk there often enough that taking *something* with them each time isn't unfeasible. At least one of them would be under house arrest with the baby anyways, it's not like they can take it through the forest. The very least they could have done is build a place for Momma Blunt to give birth where her contractions aren't risking her life and where the babies immediate cries wouldn't be louder than anything in a three mile radius. For me it would have been that much more devastating knowing that they had a plan, that there was a safe solution *just* out of reach. 

I mean, they were expecting a goddamn baby and their best solution is to put it in a box? What about when they have to feed it? It's gonna cry when it's hungry and it won't stop crying until it has food in it's mouth, so what about those seconds in between where you've already opened the lid but haven't got the bottle to it yet? Or what about when you have to change it's diaper? As it's growing they won't be able to interact with it because babies laugh and make noise when you give them attention. The only long term solution is being in a place where that noise won't get them killed. 

The strongest points for staying are the electricity and communication, but really those only apply to the dad. There's no reason for the kids to be there while the dad is in recon mode, we even know that they're explicitly not allowed down there.

If they want to grow their own food they can do that on the river too, they only need enough for four (plus they already established that it's not hard to catch fish there).  It's not like they're managing the farm, can you imagine the noise a tractor would make in that field? If they're getting anything from it it's only what they can gather by hand, and if they're gonna do that they might as well do it in the safety of a neighboring waterfall. 

Knocking over the lamp wouldn't have been a big deal near the waterfall. A baby crying wouldn't have been a big deal near the waterfall. It makes more sense to spend the majority of their time near an area that they know the monsters ignore. ",8a5qdo

For example, the department store in the opening still had bags of chips on the shelves because, well, obviously. I wondered how the dad could run up and down the farm when he had to and not be heard, but it was because he had burned things to create ash to step on, which wouldn't create sound. The floorboards were painted to show where to step exactly to avoid creaks. The family used lettuce leaves as plates for dinner. Those are just a few things I noticed that I thought were amazing details.

Even the nail on the stairs - I've had that exact thing happen on a staircase connecting a basement to the first floor - as in, I also stepped on it just like the mother did. It wasn't protruding as much, but it was just an old set of wooden stairs that I guess it somehow warped its way to stick out due to something. 

Not being terrified to be outside I'd easily explain as they knew what attracted them, survival instincts kicked in, and they knew they had to get food or the alternative was to just die of dehydration/starvation. The speaker idea, eh, who knows - it was only what, a year and a half? They already had the lights set up so maybe it wasn't a priority/thought of yet. 

The one thing I agree was odd was the electricity. No idea where they were getting it from. But with a movie with this premise, I think it'd be impossible to not have at least some questionable realistic aspects, but overall they did an amazing job with it, imo.

I don't think we ever see them attacking something that is not still in the same location it was when it made the noise. Even the raccoon seems to have basically stayed put when it was squashed. The fact that they killed a raccoon also seems to illustrate that they *don't* know what kind of prey they're looking for, so recognizing what a human ""looks like"" via echolocation doesn't seem like it would help.

There honestly doesn't seem to be any indication that they have evolved to hunt moving targets, or to identify what prey is by its shape. It seems like their whole deal is ""follow unusual sound to its source, obliterate, hopefully meat occurs"". They seem not to care what they kill, as long as meat occurs.

Honestly, if I had to guess, I'd say they evolved for some sort of alien caves, with possibly stationary prey (maybe something that grows on the ceilings, then at some point drops into the water, making a sound).

dxcgyv8,"His second main trait is determination. We see that he tries to be intuitive, but as far as electronics go he doesn’t really know what he’s doing. He doesn’t know how to build a functioning hearing aide for his daughter, and he’s not even sure if his radio is working, which is suggesting that the world around him has gone extinct. Yet no matter how many failures, Lee is the type of man to keep trying until he gets something right. He continues to tinker with hearing aides, he salvages old radio and computer parts to boost their home radio, and he tries to contact every country on earth, despite how unlikely their help would be. Lee believes that if he stops trying his family will all die. He inherits all the pressure for keeping them safe. This proves problematic considering his dynamic with his daughter which we’ll discuss below. It’s also suggested that Lee is a god fearing man as he initiates the silent grace at the dinner table. 

His final trait is overprotectiveness. Lee makes a lot of decisions to limit his daughter’s freedom because she is deaf, and that makes her a liability. Following the death of his son, he determines that she won’t be able to protect herself because she won’t be able to hear nearby noises that will put her in danger, whether she makes the noise or not. So he mandates that she stay home with her mother and keeps her from the basement, likely out of fear she’ll make a noise. He makes his top priority to restore his daughter’s hearing so she will be less of a liability. He completes his arc when he is forced to confront how helpless he is to protect them from the monsters, so he sacrifices them to give them a chance. He reminds his children he loves them and then allows himself to be destroyed. He probably also feared that if he made a noise simply to distract the monster, but one that wouldn’t lead to his death it would leave the door open for his children trying to rescue him and inadvertently falling into more danger. 

Lee’s key character flaw is that he fails to see how his parental decisions affect his family. He is likely also still grieving which blinds him to the fact that his determination and overprotectiveness is actually alienating his daughter. He is so concerned with addressing base instincts that he fails to recognize he is just exacerbating his daughters guilt stricken conscious. Like all parents, his love goes largely misunderstood until his tragic death.

Finally Regan. Honestly I could probably write 2 pages APA style about this character alone, but I’m too lazy and it’s 2am as I write this. She’s by far the most complex character being an angsty teenage guilt stricken no just for her brother’s death, but also for the liability she is to the family. She comes to decide that her very existence is an nuisance and doubts that her father will come to rescue her. Even before the invasion, Regan has received special attention likely her whole life, if you assume she was born deaf. After the invasion the family needs to tediously manipulate their environment to accommodate her such that she is able to remain perfectly silent despite not being able to tell when she is making a noise. She symbolizes the typical modern disabled child as the entire family unit’s wellbeing is predicated on accommodating her. 

Her primary arc is learning to recontextualize her father’s life in a positive light. She discovers that she has been projecting her own resentment onto everyone else all along. She has given up as she recognizes the futility of her own situation with the monsters. The emotional heart of the film is she recognize her dad’s hearing aide was actually the monster’s weakness. He realizes that even if she wasn’t receiving the love she thought she wanted from her dad, he ultimately made the right decisions to keep her alive. It’s ironic that the failure that should undermine his key character traits is a failure that inadvertently saves his family. Her secondary arc is accepting the limitations of her disability in the world she lives in. She understands the overprotective treatment she received was not out of resentment but actually from love

There’s a lot of nuance to say about her character that I’m too sleep to go into, but if someone wants to tell me that these characters are flat then that person flat out didn’t engage with the film.

dx75jlo,"The creatures actually looked very much vulnerable. But the movie was inconsistent as well. 

For instance, it cuts through the silo wall like butter, but can't do the same to the old truck roof???

Ultra-sonic sound? Really? If the press had time to print and have papers inform the public that, ""It's SOUND!"" then there is absolutely no way the movie's scenario is even plausible. We have high frequency sound emitting devices used to disperse teenagers already.

It wouldn't even take 24 hours for current humanity in most developed countries to make super high frequency weapons that would probably just kill those things in an instant. The military or the governments can build them in some underground bunker or heavily armor plated facility, no problem.

Hell, you could probably even get an amp and huge speakers and turn up music so high, they wouldn't be able to locate a person standing next to them. All we have to do is put on some ear muffs and dance around them buck naked. -_-;;

But consider that even if someone had been able to kill one of the creatures with a gun (or any weapon that would make a sound), they would have quickly been overcome by any other creatures in the area. I'm just surprised they hadn't come up with a way to trap the creatures somehow by this point, although I supposed building traps in complete silence would be a difficult task.

They first have to collect the information where all the objects are standing somehow, before they can build a mental representation of that in their head. Mhh ....maybe every tree makes a different sound given the total numbers of its leaves,but trees lose leaves all the time, so they have no fixed amount of leaves which do not change.Yes maybe creature can sense the shape of the magnetic field of the earth at any given time and place and navigate by that, like birds do parthwise.In addition to that the mind and memory system of this creature could be so powerfull, that it has perfect memory and just can map all the tree points by hearing their leaves make sound.

I'm actually more apt to believing they have some form of echolocation after reading other posts.

>It happens in all the scenes that the creatures reach them in under 10 seconds.No matter where they are.

Yes, as I said, I think the area is actually rather small, but in any case they are extremely fast and I do believe they have echolocation.

>There are also construction methods where you can glue wooden houses together and/or screw them together.If they manage to bring tones of sand onto the road, where they clearly must have used some non motorized wheeled wagon to transport it, than they can also dismantle bricks form some house in the town or wooden beams and transport them to the waterfall or river. If they have electricity, which it totaly looks like(even when nobody explains what creates the electricity(generators would be to loud)) then they just can emit music or record the sound of the waterfall or river and then play it 24 hours all day over the speakers to mask their noise they are making, either to build the new house near the natural sound source like the river or to live in their old house,talking to each other.

Yeah I can't continue with this one, it's getting close to vapid.

>Radios use electromagnetic waves. I assumed that they can somehow see magnetic fields and navigate with that. So if they cant sense electro magnetic waves and therefore also not magnetic fields,then we are again back at the question how do they navigate through their environment.

...That's a form of radiation, it's not called electromagnetic waves, it's called electromagnetic radiation, and while I accept echolocation I have to wonder if radiation would be a better tracker of people, or even heat.

>No they cant. Becuase there is this one scene with his wife where the creature is literaly standing 1 meter away from here while she is sitting in the bathtub and does not hear her breathing or hearthbeat at all. Beside of that downstairs in the flooded room with the baby...the water there is definitely not so loud that it would mask her walking through the water.

Yes, they can, when the creatures are close no one is treated as safe simply because they're still, indeed they show the creatures listening closely every time they get near someone, which implies they are in fact listening for a heartbeat, this is shown in the scene with the daughter when it listens for her heartbeat and instead is overwhelmed by her hearing aid. They do this yet again when the wife is in the tub, but the fireworks go off, and in the basement. Yes, the water is loud, but also, she isn't making a different noise *from* the water, she is blending in to the noise of the water rushing around and gently splashing against surfaces.
>Again they could mask any building process with playing constantly music or recorderd river or waterfall sounds.

I'm sure the creatures wouldn't attack this new source of sound.

>A hydro electric dam uses the force of gravity to power turbines which then create electricity.Electric Turbines are very loud, i visited once one.And the creatures seem to destroy everything which makes excessive noise, because it hurts their ""ears"" (thats seems to be also the main reason why they dont eat the things they kill...they just want the noise to stop). The only reason they endure the waterfall or river is that they cant destroy constantly floating or falling water, how should this work. Now you could argue that they then also would destroy the speaker which the humans could use to play music or recorded sounds of rivers and waterfalls. But if they hear recorded sounds of waterfalls, how do they then now that it is not the real sound, if they cant see. They seem not that smart to figure that out...at least they do not act very smart through the whole movie.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say they can't destroy hydroelectric dams, or, indeed, enter them. No, they're weapons, they're programmed to destroy living things, it doesn't ""hurt"" their ears. They probably attacked a variety of noises at some time, the film seems to show their ability to gain familiarity, especially in how the other signals didn't appear, implying the family was now alone. I would argue a new sound would be attacked, regardless, and then they would adjust to it if their attack didn't succeed.

>It just makes no sense nevertheless.

That...is the entire point of the film, stop, contrarian.

>If the creators are so smart that they can manipulate genes on that level to create such things and travel through space for light years, then they are definitely smart enough to understand the concept of electromagnetic waves 

I really do wish you'd stop incorrectly calling it electromagnetic waves, EMR, electromagnetic radiation, but beyond that you don't buy the most basic concepts, like not building loudly around sound hunting monsters, so I have to believe you'd never buy anything aliens do. I will, however, give it a shot. Initially radiation could be an effective means of hunting people, but more so heat, once people start living on the land radiation ceases being trackable, but heat? People would still be easy to track with heat, until they understood it and started insulating themselves, people would then migrate to warm climates where they would be effectively invisible, but even then, there are nights, and rain, so it would still work. Sound, however, is universal, everything makes sound, all terrestrial animals make sound, humans make a lot of sound, and they have heartbeats, which are loud in close proximity, making it an ideal tracking mechanism paired with limited echolocation for travel and attacking.",8a5qdo

I did not say this. I said it's not politically correct. I think there's a difference there. And yes, it's not politically correct to see a movie where the hero's accept traditional gender roles and pray over their meals and rely on guns. The movie was actually slammed by some mainstream outlets for those reasons, like [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-silently-regressive-politics-of-a-quiet-place).

> Wouldn't it be more unique if the mother went out and hunted 

That's subjective. I don't think so. The movie works because it's a reflection of reality. I also dont want to harp on the political correctness thing too much, because like I said, it's secondary. But I consider it to be non-politically correct when the beginning of the rebirth of civilization starts with a white, hetero-normative, cisgender, christian family defending themselves with guns and traditional gender roles. The movie isn't overtly political, which is why I label it non-politically correct. It's just to say that it's not politically correct. Not to mention how much balls John Krasinski has for directing a movie with a very pro-life message. If there's one thing Hollywood isn't, it's pro-life. I hate myself for ranting about this lol. I also don't think they set out to make a movie with any kind of political message, by the way. I don't think I'm being sold anyone's propaganda.

As for the truck, you could chalk that up the fact that the monster may have only been able to tear through the silo that quickly due to the intense pain it was in over the hearing aid frequency. Wheareas at the truck she shut the aid off so the monster wasn't quite frantic/enraged.

For Kraskinski not throwing the axe, he was clearly bleeding out and on death's door anyway. His only thoughts right then were of saving his children. ",8a5qdo

Is that really so hard to imagine?

Also, as I said in my original post, there's the idea that the only way to truly win over these aliens is to keep the human race going until they are defeated. More kids = more humans. It's a calculated risk like anything else they do.

There's two valid reasons. Remember, it's not a plot hole just because YOU wouldn't do it. It's only a plot hole if the large majority of people wouldn't do it or there was no reason for it. They clearly wrote the movie to show that the grief of losing their youngest son pushed them to get pregnant again.

dx3h990,"Yeah man I can dig that.  

But I don't think its impossible that it wouldn't have been figured out before civilization collapsed.  Its possible that much of the damage was done very early on in the creatures existence; consider society now, the noise we make, imagine having to live in complete silence else you were essentially murdered.  Switching to such a demanding level of silence after years of an ingrained habit allowing us to express ourselves in countless, free manners.

Basically, I feel its possible that civilization collapsed to the point that survivors were incredibly spread, and anyone who was researching didn't have the logistics/equipment to give out PSA's of the creatures weakness.

Since in the film [the character family only seen one human, and any other evidence of humanity was the one fire in the distance when the father lit that fire (I think that was another survivors fire?) and the lack of communication on the radio airways he checked with morse code its safe to say they were not in contact with other people.  The lack of said contact creates a scenario were its believable the family didn't figure out or think to use sound as a weapon.  They lived in isolation and fear.  This also suggests that its not beyond the realm of possibilities that out there somewhere there is a group who have figured out this key weapon and are slowly spreading it among survivors - remember, this story is about one family in a ravaged world.] (#spoiler)

Parenting requires empathy and perspective on development, not authoritarianism, to raise well-developed children capable of independence--which those kids need.  Jim is a much more authoritarian parent than Mary Poppins.

Per the literature on parenting styles and their effects on adolescents: ""Authoritarian parents are low in responsiveness yet highly demanding. The authoritarian parenting style is associated with parents who emphasize obedience and conformity and expect that rules be obeyed without explanation in a less warm environment [16]. Additionally, authoritarian parents exhibit low levels of trust and engagement toward their child, discourage open communication, and engage in strict control [8]. More specifically, verbal hostility and psychological control were found to be the most detrimental of the authoritarian-distinctive, coercive power-assertive behaviors [16].
Adolescents from most Caucasian authoritarian families have been found to exhibit poor social skills, low levels of self-esteem, and high levels of depression [17].""  (Citation: www.mdpi.com:8080/2075-4698/4/3/506/pdf)

I guess my problem with that was they literally opened up their face every time like that to hear noises.

Just felt like when writing the script they had a bullet point for 'father needs to sacrifice himself to save his kids' and tacked it in at that moment despite it not really fitting the spot too well....since we've just established in 2 prior scenes that his daughter is wearing the one weapon that deters them I didn't for a moment feel she was in any danger in that scene, didn't feel any tension or sadness at his action, I just face palmed and was like ''whelp...that was for nothing''.

Also worth pointing out that the only reason the creature was drawn to the truck in the first place was because the son called out to his father after seeing him getting attacked (when he sent the kids ahead to the truck and stayed behind with the axe)....so it's like...the dad's (already unnecessary) last stand...is a large part of what caused his kids to be attacked in the first place...so he makes another move to draw it off the kids...which turns out to be again unnecessary since his daughter is wearing their kyrptonite.

dx65rr6,">Clearly explained, what is the difference between a plot hole and a 'leap of logic'

Just to clarify, this was a typo. I meant to say leaps in logic on your part as the viewer, meaning your issues stemmed more from failing to follow the logic of the film, not the film breaking its own logic. My mistake.",8a5qdo
dx659xa,"Well none of what you listed here are leaps of logic. Most of what you said is just rejecting the premise of the film. This is like rejecting Star Wars because space ships don't really move that fast in space. The premise of the film is that the military wasn't able to defeat the monsters. That establishes the logic of the film. To be a plot hole it would have to break that logic. 

Living next to the river would've meant abandoning a comfortable home they had already sound proofed anyway. It also exponentially increases risk for the deaf daughter. She can't tell if she's close enough to the river to mask the sound of her stepping on grass and leaves.

The only reason this family manages to uncover the monster's weakness is because the father doesn't know how to build a functioning hearing aide. The noise itself wasn't the weakness, but the specific frequency he tuned it to. It's implied the monsters use echolocation from the clicking noises they make as well as the animation of their ears. The hearing aide must be tuned to the same frequency they are echolocating. Their skin is impenetrable enough to survive the heat of a meteorite entering the atmosphere, but this feedback reveals their their vulnerable interior. I'm sure the family never bothered shooting at them before because it's just a sure fire way to attract more creatures, which is exactly what happens. 

We also know for a fact that the monsters destroy any sources of noise they can manage. Speakers, TV, humans, etc. They can't destroy a waterfall and simple conditioning would have them learn to avoid that at some point. 

As far as I can tell there were two confirmed plot holes. One is a continuity error where the infant's sound proof box opens itself. This error might be the result of editing, and it's relatively minor, but this meets the definition of a plot hole. The second one is that they ride a semi in neutral through a bush less than a few yards away from the monster but don't attract them. They shut the car door which also doesn't seem to attract danger. 

A possible plot hole is the deaf girl knowing exactly how to silence the speaker of the rocketship without disabling the lights. This is more of a contrivance than anything. ",8a5qdo
dx64rye,"I agree. The husband and the wife were some of the smartest characters I've seen in a thriller movie, especially monster movies. Nothing they did was really eyes rolling dumb. The wife did great to stay quiet and her decision to use the timer to escape was pretty smart. And it was clear the husband definitely did his fair share of research on his own attempting to find a way to destroy the monsters. 

Shit, their ability to stay that composed in the face of death is a very underrated human trait alone. And to have that much of an ability to create some semblance of a lifestyle impressed me. Anyone can easily claim they would have done this and that, but how many of us would REALLY have the ability to set up elaborate cameras, crops, bunkers, etc. without the internet or other sources? Probably damn near none of us (myself included).

The only decision that was kind of ""dumb"" is deciding to have another baby given how loud they are, but after some thought, it's not really that stupid of a plot point. 1) The parents were clearly still grieving over the first child, so perhaps they felt that having another child would help them/the family get past that. 2) Maybe the pregnancy was unplanned and ""just happened."" Kind of hard to abort a baby with no medical technology and expecting a (good looking) married couple to not fuck each other ever is pretty dumb thinking. 3) The wife not being pregnant completely deflates how tense half the movie was. Definitely a solid addition to the plot. ",8a5qdo

In the case of this new psuedo-silent film genre the characterization is told visually. Production design (sets, costumes, etc) gives viewers the info they need to make inferences about the past. The only other information you need about a character is their actions in the movie. The characters in A Quiet Place barely put a page of dialogue together between the 5 of them, yet I could describe each with paragraphs of detail. This is incredibly effective visual storytelling.

I can describe all of the movies I listed in one sentence. If I couldn't I wouldn't have cited them as examples. I'll spare that wall of text unless you insist.


I don't think your giving John enough credit. Again I repeat myself that I could write at least two or three paragraphs to describe his behavior despite him being silent most of the film.

I said most of the of the jump scares were great, not all of them. Other than the ones you mentioned the rest were extremely tense and had consequences. This film advertised it self as a quiet thriller with jump scares and it delivered.

I demonstrated to you how many of your criticisms only make sense if you remove certain parts of the screenplay. To move the goal post to ""it just wasn't enough *for me*"" doesn't increase tnt validity of your original statement which was that character and plot were elements lacking in the film.

I never said any one *should* downvote you. I only explained why they were.

No they wouldn't, that's ambient noise. These creatures are smart enough to distinguish.

That would have been tough to pull off since we see previously that there are only 3 monsters in the area, plus it would be dubious at best  to think that every group out there was collectively losing their shit. 

I think a group foraging scene would have been nice, where instead of us randomly coming across the old man we perhaps have him join the father and son outing to the waterfall and on the way back we come across his dead wife and have him again purposefully kill himself by yelling out.

dxb9q5y,"Since you're not being specific it's still quite hard to understand your derision. Despite the vagueness, this is what I can try to explain to assuage your frustration:

* RE not scary; perhaps movies with more jump scares or just plain gore are your style. This is not low grade horror like saw or scream. The tension and cinematography are more important and the focal point. This may not be your style of horror and that's fine, but I would not see critically acclaimed horrors in the future, as many people are bored by that sort of visceral horror that doesn't take any real skill to create. The tension is what people are reacting to and creating an atmospheric horror like this is more complex.

* RE plot holes, the movie begins en media res on purpose, which is why a lot of things are not explained. if you are upset about the way the characters acted, I would look into dramatic irony. The dissonance between the audience's perspective and the character's can make characters appear to act irrational in some cases which may appear frustrating or creating plot holes.

* RE overlooked elements; if you are upset by lack of definition, I'd suggest you do some googling to understand more about the 'world'. I know that will probably make you say ""but why isn't it in the movie I don't want to have to Google to discover this."" A movie doesn't have to explain everything to you and not explaining things to you does not make a movie bad; life isn't that neat either.

* RE cliches; I can't really speak on this. Is a son dieing from activating a rocket toy to a monster that hunts by sound cliche? Is the father sacrificing himself over the guilt of letting his youngest son die when he could have made noise to attract the monster cliche? Is his penultimate sacrifice to save his remaining children cliche? I have some bad news for you; all stories have been done before.

Every time another character or even the mother went down those steps I felt anxiety to see if someone else was going to step on it again. It may have been a ploy by the writers to cheat the audience to keep a feeling of constant anxiety during that part of the film. 

But to counter that I believe the reason they did not use the shotgun before hand was because it was just too risky. On the whiteboard in the basement it said ""3 known in the area"" There was too much risk involved from the characters perspective to risk their being more to deal with. And once they figured out that there was a vulnerability to that frequency they used it as a advantage when they got close enough to deal with them with little risk.

The only really big thing I wish they had shown was the use of some sort of 'sound grenade'.  It's funny because during the first half of the film I kept thinking, 'man, I'd be carrying around a bunch of egg timers or something' so I was super pumped up when she grabs the egg timer off the shelf.  I was like, 'holy shit, they read my mind!'.  The one other thing I wish they had done was rig up the property with remote controlled speakers on a PA system so that they could drown out their own sounds if needed but overall I thought the film did an excellent job of introducing an enemy and then problem solving for that enemy within reason and using logic and critical thinking.

Wooden stairs like those don't get ""worn"" like that.  What are you talking about?  It isn't like a layer of sedimentary rock after a few thousand years of wind and rain, it is just people walking down them occasionally.  Have you never been in an old wooden building?

dwwbhk7,"“There is a distinct difference between ""suspense"" and ""surprise,"" and yet many pictures continually confuse the two. I'll explain what I mean. 

We are now having a very innocent little chat. Let's suppose that there is a bomb underneath this table between us. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, ""Boom!"" There is an explosion. The public is surprised, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene, of no special consequence. Now, let us take a suspense situation. The bomb is underneath the table and the public knows it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is aware the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions, the same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene. The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ""You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. There is a bomb beneath you and it is about to explode!"" 

In the first case we have given the public fifteen seconds of surprise at the moment of the explosion. In the second we have provided them with fifteen minutes of suspense. The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed. Except when the surprise is a twist, that is, when the unexpected ending is, in itself, the highlight of the story.”

dx080xk,Not OP but I live near a small theater that only plays one or two movies at a time and I literally just go see whatever they are playing when I feel like seeing a movie. Sometimes I’ll look it up quickly beforehand but only read like a 2 sentence summary. I don’t have a TV either so I never see commercials and watching or looking up trailers isn’t really interesting to me. Only ones I ever see are at the movies when I go. Sometimes coworkers will be talking about a movie and I’ll hear a little from them but that’s about it.,8a5qdo
dxhwkxb,"For me, I navigate what's probably gonna be good by personal recommendations.

I'll tell friends (or people on Reddit) which movies are my favorites, and then ask ""knowing that, what else might I like?"" Then I find patterns--like, if people recommended a particular film the most, more than any other film has been recommended.

I also look for subtle/vague reviews. Just seeing if people say stuff like ""such and such film is revolutionary, biggest film of the age, etc etc"" big praises often translate into good recommendations if you learn to avoid trash sources/clickbait. But I still usually rely on friends or internet strangers for personalized recommendations based on my specific taste.

However, I'd argue it's worth it. Over time you intuit how to navigate around that obstacle. For example, I can usually always find a good movie by telling others what my favorite movies are, and asking them what else I might like.

You can go further, to, by finding patterns. Notice when a particular film is recommended to you multiple times. It's perhaps a sign that it's at least decent and worth watching.",8a5qdo

I think it became much easier for me when I became a cord cutter; trailers are all over traditional TV but I haven't had traditional TV in years so they aren't forced in front of me like they once were. 

As far as habit, it was pretty easy as trailers have become so full of spoilers that I was happy to eleminate them from my life. I can actually remember the exact time I made the decision: some years ago my GF and I were trying to decide what movie to watch. One of them was the movie Begin Again. We decided to watch the trailer to see what it was all about. Well, the trailer shows the entire three act arc. After the trailer we didn't feel like we needed to watch the movie, as the trailer basically was Cliffs Notes on the movie. So, I decided no more trailers for me. It's been great. ",8a5qdo

I'm surrounded by white-boards at work. When we start a project, we often write out the most obvious, but critically important ideas, and we keep them there. There have been multiple times where I've actually been embarrassed by higher-ups walking past my desk and seeing some of the inane, dreadfully obvious stuff I have written, starred, and circled. But it's worthwhile keeping it in the front of your mind.

And then, over time, you get so used to those things that you forget about them. When you erase the board you subconsciously leave those parts up.

dxfxshe,"First of all, let me clear something up.  When I use the word ""Communists"", I don't mean it in the negative connotative way that Americans often use it.  It's just an easier and still accurate way of saying ""Pathet Lao"" or ""People's Army of Vietnam"" or the many other names of the people who sympathized with communism.  

Second of all, What you fail to realize is why the Hmong entered the war in the first place.  Of all the things to fight for, a home isn't a bad one.  The Hmong were stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Not doing anything may lead to being under communists rule. I would think that living conditions would become unpreferable as autonomy (the Hmongs' general previous living conditions) and communism don't mix at all, digging the Hmong deeper into the hole of persecution.  Joining the war would lead to obvious bloodshed, but the possibilities of a new and better life hung in front of them.  Despite their long history of bad luck, Hmong people are people of tradition and so they fought to uphold it.  Their land, their lifestyle, it's pretty simple why the common Hmong would join the fight just like they did thousands of years ago with the Chinese. 

Now in the big picture, I'm quite unsure what motivated Gen. Vang Pao (The Hmong leader responsible for organizing the Hmong forces and dealing with the CIA).  He's Hmong, but I'm sure the motivations of a man who became a general and a farmer living secluded in the jungle, such as my Grandfather, would differ.  If anyone was gambling, it was Gen. Vang Pao.  Gen. Vang Pao was the one looking at the hand dealt to him.  My Grandfather was merely a chip to be bid.  

Lastly, my grandfather was a ""good guy"" but not because he fought communists and was DEFENDING THE FREE WORLD.  Nah, he's a ""good guy"" because he never forgot his duty to his family.  He fought for his family.  The fighting he did in Laos is rather insignificant to how hard he fought to create a new life here in America.  ",8a5qdo

A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

Plus, it super pissed me off that when they switched to Regan's POV, she was completely deaf, even when she wore her CI. Unless the batteries were dead, the whole point of a CI is that you can now hear! IF the batteries were dead, why would she continue to wear them?

Also, I'm still not sure I'd call this horror, and maybe that's because I'm used to the idea of horror being monster flicks that only show up on Friday the 13th and Halloween. So my definition may be narrow. I see this more as as scifi thriller. But again that's an entirely other discussion.

When you're living that way, I'm sure people would miss the freedom of being able to speak at whatever volume they want and not be stressed about every little noise they make.

also the military uses radio comms. they at no point noticed the aliens reacting to their feedback?

i'm sorry, it just doesn't make sense to me.

I think people who say this are grasping at straws. It was a year and a half of chaos and confusion, it is impossible to say someone would *definitely* discover a weakness by then, especially since the aliens destroy you when you try to audibly communicate your ideas on the matter.

>They should have had maybe a mid movie climax where the dad unloads on the creatures and it does nothing.

I disagree on the mid movie climax point as well. On the dad's white board it explicitly said the aliens have armor and that he's looking for a weakness. The first time one of the aliens is shot it is unphased. Put two and two together. I really don't think they needed to spoon feed it anymore than they did. A mid movie climax would have done nothing but disrupt the flow of the movie, as a climax implies relief and this movie is anything but relieving.

>make them a more credible threat.

However, at the time I genuinely thought that was what you were meant to think and that characters had already made that link - hence the notation.  Mind you, it could be because I have very sensitive eyes - which are great in the dark - but generally means I'm wearing shades in daytime even on cloudy or rainy days in order to stop my eyes from watering constantly - so maybe that principal is more obvious to me than most peeps?  I was actually a bit confused at first as to why the characters didn't seem to be acting on that knowledge, which turned to frustration when it took so long for them to realise something literally staring them in the face.  I know it happens - solutions staring you in the face - we've all been there, but for nearly a year? On top of all the other contrivances?  It was a bit much for me.](#spoiler)

Its NOT the scene where dad says ""I love you"" in sign before he dies while she watches. Dad dying was part 1 of a 1-2-punch-knockout, and part 2 comes right after.

More specifically, Its that scene and those moments afterwards, when Regan stops at the top of the stairs to the workshop (after dads been killed, and the rest of the family quickly rushes down)... then slowly walks down and discovers / quietly observes everything that Dad has been doing down there, and it all *becomes clear*. This is the emotional climax of the film for me, and its done in silence. The dad is already dead - they've already done that scene where he says ""i love you"". 

How Dad never gave up working on iterations of those hearing aids (despite them never ultimately working... and maybe him never even being qualified enough and realistically even capable of succeeding in the first place). He never gave up.. and that stubbornness caused him to stumble into creating a (malfunctioning) hearing aid that caused that feedback loop.... which ultimately Regan discovered in the end can be used to use the monsters main strength (acute hearing sensitivity - allowing it to hunt with devastating efficiency and accuracy) into their main weakness and Achilles heel (hyper-sensitivity, manifesting in pain and effective torture, to certain wavelengths of sound etc).

If they have a active(producing sound and leting it bounce of of objects to analyze the reflections of it) ultrasonic or echolocation like bats have them, then they basically can sense exactly where someone is standing by screaming in the direction where the humans stand and sensing the sound reflecting of the humans.Even without the humans making any sound on their own.

>Yes, as I said, I think the area is actually rather small, but in any case they are extremely fast and I do believe they have echolocation.

They cant move with 300 km/h or something simular to that through a dense area like a forest if they are blind at the same time and if they have echolocation in a active form, like bats, then they can sense the exact position of humans or other creatures, even then when the humans make no sound at all themself.

>That's a form of radiation, it's not called electromagnetic waves, it's called electromagnetic radiation.

Sorry english is not my main language. I didnt found the right word for it.

>I'm sure the creatures wouldn't attack this new source of sound.

But what if it sounds exactly like waterfalls or floating rivers. After getting used to the sound of floating rivers or waterfalls they would probably learn and get used to it. Im not really sure if they would atttack the source of the sound of floating water on a spot they havent heard it before or if they would just think:""i have heard that before and already made the experience that it is not of interest for me"".

>I'm going to go out on a limb and say they can't destroy hydroelectric dams, or, indeed, enter them.

We have seen one of them burst trough the wall of the metal silo in under a second, is it really so hard to belive that a whole pack of them can destroy a metal door in a few hours? Or just burst through a window and then rip all the turbines in pices(as said those kind of turbines are loud as fuck even compared to the backrground noise)..... i would have found it even more realistic from you if you would have said that they are hocked up to a solar energy source, but even then how can they have electricity at night? The house didnt seem like one of those hyper modern solar houses which has a extra room filled with giant batterys to store the solar energy for the night. It looked rather like a pretty old barn.

>That...is the entire point of the film, stop, contrarian.

What? The whole point of the movie is that the movie makes no sense?
Why should i then not complain about it.Stop telling me what to think ;)

>you don't buy the most basic concepts, like not building loudly around sound hunting monsters

I already told you that there are so many construction technologies, like glueing wooden beams together, or building houses out of clay and hey. Stacking together brick walls is also not loud if you slowly place down the bricks. Especially if they build them right beside the waterfall or river, which would overshatter the rest noises. When they can carry thousands of tons of sand to cover miles of roads and train ways with sand, then they also can carry a few tons of bricks. But you didnt anser any of that...you just ignored all of it.

>once people start living on the land radiation ceases being trackable, but heat? People would still be easy to track with heat, until they understood it and started insulating themselves, people would then migrate to warm climates where they would be effectively invisible, but even then, there are nights, and rain, so it would still work. Sound, however, is universal

Why not design those creatures in a way that they can hear really good but at the same time can also see (including the infra red spectrum for heat vision) and smell really good. Why would you take all of the possible senses away from them and leave them only with hearing, if they would be more powerfull as killing machine if they can make use of multiple senses at the same time...like most other creatures on our planet?

Idk... the only things i agree with you is that they maybe would destroy the speaker emiting sound and that it can be called radiation. But all the other stuff you argued is just not plausible for me. But i feel the triggering rising in you so i leave it at that ....just one more thing ;)

dwwx6lh,"My argument isn't that the conflict only furthered the plot, I meant to say that the conflict is so non-existent that it only ever seems to matter when the plot needs it to. Here's what I mean. The girl runs off because she feels untrusted by John Krasinski and this leaves Emily Blunt isolated. That's such an irrational decision that a character we're told is ""smart"" repeatedly makes. This doesn't really happen for any other reason. 

Let's get back to Don't Breathe. These career criminals didn't know about the network of traps set up by a geriatric, blind Vietnam war veteran, which is why they were up shit creek. Their original plan was just to break in and steal shit, they didn't know how well The Blind Man was able to defend himself. We, the audience, and the characters already know the ""rules"" and internal logic of AQP, so while the characters in Don't Breathe made dumb decisions and made serious mistakes, it was largely out of legitimate ignorance. The little girl and other characters do dumb things and seemingly ignore the logic of their own world. 

Also, in Don't Breathe, there was a real conflict. Jane Levy had a plan to rescue her sister from the trailer park and their abusive family but was still grappling with the morals of robbing someone who had served in Vietnam. What was the deal with Emily Blunt and the young boy? 

Adding on to my point about the monsters, the monsters only ever appear when the plot needs them too. Emily Blunt is pregnant and is about to scream in pain? Better bring in the monsters. John Krasinski needs a father/son bonding moment? Nah, get rid of them. Sure, they explain this but it feels contrived. ",8a5qdo

If that was the case, arm everyone with dog whistles and blow them at the creatures.

you are in a subreddit designed to discuss movies. you are in the wrong place. Maybe you need a quiet place?

>You seriously analyzed what the kids did after their father died, and wrote what they should have done instead. You actually listed that as a ""plot hole.""

Yes. The kids put the truck in neutral and roll down the hill. How silent would that have been? If they have been training for over a year to be nearly totally silent, then it would go against the setup of the world. Not only that, but the truck is PREPARED to be a safe spot and a getaway. (it rolls directly towards the dip near the house, and a sandy walkway is prepared to start where the truck stops.) The VERY SAFEST thing the could have done is stand still and be quiet. This is shown by example when the farmer kills himself by screaming in the woods. They actually do the setup for this premise but don't follow through. I get the feeling this is studio interference for a ""more exciting"" climax.

Just think about that scenario for two seconds. ANY loud noise distracts the creature. Just throwing your axe into the nearby corn would have made crazy noise for the monster. I get the sacrifice of the dad though. It was set up earlier by the wife's conversation about ""do anything to save the kids""

So yeah, the kids escaping in a loud truck from a killer that hunts sound is a major plot hole. 

>Also, there are residential solar panels that are quieter than refrigerators, so unless you find refrigerators particularly noisy then no, they could have had a relatively quiet power source.

Yes, this was my point earlier, and it beats the city providing power (bigger plot hole). Showing that element in a wide shot would have quelled a lot of scrutiny. 

>Please explain what kind of trap the father is going to make? 

i did already, but i'll spoon feed it to you again if you like. Windmills with junk, church bells, police sirens, or even simple wind chimes out in the forest to draw them away. They do it with fireworks IN the movie. Setting one up without it going off would have been an amazingly tense scene.

>That's again, not a ""plot hole"" that's you being mad that the movie didn't go in the direction YOU wanted it to. 

Whos mad? Not me. Just sad that the high standard of detail was not consistent. I'm not changing the direction of any of the polt beats, just bolstering the worldbuilding for a more engrossing tale.

>Guess what, it's not your movie it doesn't need the characters to do exactly what you expect or want them to in order to make sense.

You nailed it. It does not make sense. 

>So, again, these ""plot holes,"" are nit picks at best.

I could see how details would seem that way to you.

>""Oh man the kids didn't do exactly what I wanted them to do after their dad died, such a major plot hole.""

No. ""the kids didn't act consistently with the lore constructed in the  previous hour and a half of storytelling."" Its says ""don't make a sound, don't make a sound, don't make a sound... now GET IN A TRUCK AND ROLL DOWN THE HILL!"" 

That's ok though man. Some people can just switch their brains off.

dx1ojgl,"yes. I covered the suspension of disbelief already. But this isn't wonderland, its a farm on modern earth with regular humans. That already binds it to a ton of expected norms. This issue is that we have to break SOME norms for the movie to function. Thats ok, if they are identified in the story. Just look at how much effort went into the sand pathways. Shoeless, sand from the river, staying on the sand paths, refreshing the paths with bags of sand. It sounds like something you may have missed, but the movie was smart in some areas, and dropped the ball in others. Its the inconsistency that's the issue, not the suspension of disbelief. Ghostbusters (the real one) and the frighteners have crazy elements in grounded human worlds, but the disbelief is written into the plot and can therefore be expected. When independance day has an alien invasion from another world, but are defeated by having a macbook connection... well I find that sort of thing just too silly.

Translation: If you want to get upvoted try making sure the content you post agree's with the majority opinion.

Regardless, this statement makes absolutely no sense. You're just babbling at this point attacking my argument without any premise or conclusion as to why my comment is irrelevant. And I don't really care about getting upvoted, I don't expect everyone to agree with me or share my opinions.

My opinion: The movie is objectively bad and filled with plot holes, a lot of it doesn't make sense.

The content I posted was factually correct based on actual events in the film. To say otherwise is to commit the fallacy of argument from ignorance which really just makes **your** entire comment irrelevant. For example; 

* It makes no sense that the aliens were able to hear a glass shattering from a mile away and not someone's heart beat literally right fucking next to them.

* It makes no sense that they can hear the smallest crackle yet not hear leaves being stepped on.

* Why could the creature tear through the metal tower filled with whatever it was no problem, but struggle to get the kids in the car.

dxc5bjk,"I gotta be honest. I absolutely do not believe you could possibly describe each character with paragraphs of detail without repeating yourself multiple times. I’m much more interested in you proving that than describing the plots of the films you listed in one sentence. Though I want to see that as well because I think you’re still miss understanding what I’m saying about plot vs concept. 

If you’re not going to assume those things about the conditions of my viewing like “low level engagement” then why even bring it up in the first place?

The difference between something like Dunkirk or Mad Max vs A Quiet Place is that a) Dunkirk actively by design doesn’t have characters because it’s not about the characters and b) both films are much better at executing other aspects of the film surrounding the characters. I don’t even really like Dunkirk all that much but I think it’s far more successful at achieving what it set out to accomplish than A Quiet Place. 

“This film advertised it self as a quiet thriller with jump scares and it delivered.” I don’t understand why this excuses this film and not other horror movies that advertise themselves the same way yet still get criticized for it. Or dumb action movies that are advertised as dumb but get lambasted for being what they advertised. 

“To move the goal post to ""it just wasn't enough *for me*"" doesn't increase tnt validity of your original statement which was that character and plot were elements lacking in the film.” I’m not saying it makes my opinion more valid. I’m just saying that my opinion is just as valid as everyone else’s. But it’s not treated that way because it’s an opinion that goes against the grain. I never even said that the film was bad, just that it’s *okay.* But that’s the thing with this subreddit. Once there’s a movie that is widely popular on here, you’re either with it or against it. No gray area. You can’t just think it’s okay. You either have to love it or you’re wrong. It’s just actually fucking crazy that I can’t share an opinion on a film that is against the grain without people determined to point out that I’m wrong for my opinion on something subjective. I’m not in this thread trying to get people who think it’s amazing to not think that. I just wanted to be part of the community and voice my thoughts like everyone else. I unfortunately am guilty only of disagreeing. None of my points of contention with the film are objectively wrong or right, they’re just my honest feelings. My opinion on the depth of the characters in not factually wrong like you’re assuming, it’s simply that you saw more in the characters than I did. ",8a5qdo

I knew where it was going from the start, the jump scares were telegraphed in the extreme, and I don't think it built tension very well at all. However, it could have been at least tolerable for me if not for the plot-holes.

I've listed as many as I can remember below. Maybe they weren't enough to ruin the movie for you, but they sure as hell were for me.

Why did you not check the kid for the toy at the beginning? Both parents saw him playing with it. He is barely four, he probably doesn't even understand what is happening at this point. 

Why would you choose to get pregnant when you know that you are living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where any sound means certain death? She got knocked up after their kid died. How/why did they have sex? If they wanted to have sex, then why didn't they use birth control. Condoms have a shelf life of at least three years.

Why does knocking over a lantern inside a building make too much noise, but picking corn or clapping hands outside is fine? The creatures super-hearing only works when the movie needs it to set up scares or tension. It is widely inconstant throughout.

If the river and waterfall can muffle sound then why not eat or do anything that might make too much noise by them?  It would be cold and a little distracting, but that is better then being dead.

How did they find the farm? How did they soundproof it without getting eaten first? They have obliviously been there for a long time at this point.

How are raccoons and birds still alive if humans are almost extinct? Birds I can see because they fly away, but raccoons? Come to think of it I didn't see the creatures chasing after the birds. Why didn't they just put a bunch of them around the house for use as soundproofing.

Where did the old man come from? What happened to his wife? Why was he in the forest? How had they both survived for this long?

Last, but worst of all, and the thing that completely ruined the movie for me.

The United States which spends more on our military then any other country can't figure out that the creatures are weak to certain sonic frequencies. The huge ears on their sides didn't clue them in on that. A ten year old deaf girl found that out? That is impossible.

The movie doesn’t focus on the world, it focuses on the family and what they go through, so there’s no way of knowing what’s going on in the outside world. ",8a5qdo

And he won't let her help him on trips away from the house. Couple that with a grieving process for your brother who you think you got killed and a dangerous situation and there is your angst. Additionally he had been trying and failing to fix her hearing for around a year at least so she is probably stressed from not being able to hear for so long. She cried after trying it on.,8a5qdo

dx1l46w,And that was plenty for this movie. Human error doesn't need that much screen time.,8a5qdo
dx2c3rz,"I really enjoyed the movie, but there were plenty of small things that were a little off. 

How, with all the weapons this world has, did it never occurred to anyone in any sort of position of power to try sound weapons on these creatures with super sensitive hearing? 

The fact that in this intensely dangerous world, they just kept letting their youngest child wander around behind them with no one watching him. Why after seeing that he's climbing things and possibly making a bunch of noise while he's unattended would they  continue to leave him unattended? He's a very young child, he can't possibly grasp the gravity of the situation. You can't just trust that he knows exactly what's ok and what isn't. Why put down a toy he really wants that they just took from him, right next to him? It's literally life and death. Be a little more cautious. Why wouldn't one adult be walking in the front and one in the back during their trek? Even without the noise factor, he could have tripped and fallen, wandered off or God knows what else walking that far behind with no one looking. I don't think most parents do that anywhere in public, why would they do so in this world? 

This is more of a question than a nitpick since I know nothing about plumbing or wells, but if a pipe broke over a year after civilization had died out, would there be that much water still running through those pipes? 

If they know a somewhat useful trick like creating a louder noise elsewhere, wouldn't it help somewhat to have more things like that around on a regular basis? I'm not sure what off the top of my head, maybe remote control cars or cherry bombs or something? 

It bothered me that she was so adamant that HE had to protect them, like she was dying or something. I think if that hadn't been drilled into his head, he might have run to the truck with them instead of trying to fight it off and he would have been there to notice that it seemed bothered by her hearing aid. They survived for almost 500 goddamn days and he dies an hour or so before they figure out what works against them? DAMNIT. 

This is more of a hilarious detail that I enjoyed than a nitpick but the blind creature daintily grabbing the bannister to walk up the stairs is one of my favorite unintentionally funny parts of a movie in a long time.

Also, incredibly meaningless and it didn't bother me at all, but why were there apples on the mattress? 

That's all just off the top of my head. I'm sure there's more. It may sound like I didn't like this movie after all this bitching but I really did enjoy it a lot. I just figured I would respond with some details I thought could have been dealt with a little differently. I'll definitely admit that I don't know exactly how to do it differently and still do it well, but that's why I don't write movies. They would be absolutely terrible.  ",8a5qdo

Wooden stairs can certainly be worn down, remember that was a really old farmhouse. If the plank the step was made out of was splitting vertically, [like this]( https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/scaffolding/images/badsplit003.jpg ), and someone took it off and tried to repair it instead of replacing it I could easily see what happened in the movie happening.

Thank you.  This has always been something that bothered me about the genre.  I agree that the urge to reproduce would be on steroids in the event most of the human race was wiped out.  To me, the post-apocalyptic genre could explore some great themes about the loss of sexually morality when we're desperate to keep our species alive.  It's a shame that no one so far has had the balls to really explore something like that.  

I remember in one the episode of The 100 (don't judge me), Clarke had to make a list of 100 people who would survive the next nuclear apocalypse in the bunker.  The young men are all put out that they are not on the list and that the young women are.  Obviously, you would have to do it that way.  Now that would make for interesting drama.

The couples without them would be in less danger, less stress, less constantly with their guard up, they'd be closer to each other, have more time etc etc and that's not even getting into the staggeringly high cases of post partum depression....that in that world would likely mean death.

And there's nothing wrong with that, that's a perfectly good scene! But it felt like you could see the strings that were being pulled, instead of it happening organically.

Obviously, you're right - these aren't real people, they're characters in a script. But when characters *have* to make bad decisions or have to do things that don't make sense because it's the only way to get to the scene the writers want? That can ruin the emotional impact.

Ultimately though, I thought the ""scrambled"" brain effect from the girl's hearing aid was fitting.  It would have been neat for the science behind the sound to be fleshed out more, story-wise, instead of them lucking into it but that would have come at the price of stealing the tension.  

There are many different audio effects that could have been explained (dog whistle, noise cancelling headphones, echo/reverb) but that would have been a different movie.

I wonder if part of the mixed reaction is perhaps a vaguely cultural thing, we're European, when we stepped out of the movie the chatter from other couples around us whilst waiting to use the bathroom was predominantly pretty negative too, though I can't imagine how that would help. An Irish friend of mine who saw it liked it though (shrugs)...he's younger than both of us.

As far as movies I like if you want to judge my tastes some of my favourites in the genre are 28 days later, dawn of the dead (original), The orphanage, Evil Dead 2, Splinter, Ravenous, the thing, IT (new one), dead snow 2, The descent etc. They're all flawed (some very flawed) but not in ways that bother me. Trashy horror can be good fun but its a delicate balancing act. This tried to be more than just trashy horror but in so doing ended up (TO ME) with the worst of both worlds, it had the dodgy script of a trashy film...the constant jump scares of a trashy film (even a fucking racoon jump scare)  ..but took itself extremely seriously so lacked the fun and tone necessary to excuse the script.

 I haven't seen Batman VS Superman or any recent comic book movie I don't think, I was never into comic books growing up. Actually that's not true I saw guardians of the galaxy at a friend's place  a while back....I seem to remember thinking it was alright. I don't watch any tv shows at the moment...breaking bad was fun.

It's really weird to me how you feel the need to negatively generalise people who don't like the movie with bizarrely detailed assumptions about their lives and why it must be....could it not just be that they simply didn't think it was that great? No movie is perfect, some storytelling techniques work for some people and not for others....some character motivations are excusable for some people and not for others.

''when they see something new and different it confuses them and they get offended'' dude there is absolutely nothing new about this movie at all cmon...I saw 2015's 'hidden' last year and it's a very similar plot to this... Family surviving in a post apocalyptic monster filled world where they can't make much sound or they'll be killed...the youngest daughter fucks up and knocks over a lamp leading them to being attacked...Dad sacrifices himself to save them. Pretty standard stuff, that one had a decent twist at the end too...but overall was pretty lacking, I'd say it's on the same level as quiet place.
There is also nothing new about the kind of flaws people are taking issue with in this film...plot contrivances, jump scares, poor monster design, illogical, jarring character choices. All pretty standard cliche B grade horror movie stuff. It's not that this movie feels so new and different...it's the opposite, it feels like a sci fi channel original movie with a bigger budget....as someone who's watched a lot of shitty sci fi original movies I think I can comment with some authority on that.

I could do the same generalisation game with you too get this ''I'm convinced some people, encouraged by certain echo chambers and the internet get overly attached to certain forms of media, be it movies, books, video games, comic books etc and when one of these things they get attacked to get's criticised or particularly called 'stupid', they take it very personally as an attack on themselves as their personal taste in media is extremely important to them and one of the few things they have going for them in life...so they get extremely offended and upset  when their latest film get's some negative comments ''My taste is impecable, this can't be right?!''.... and rather than allow their brain to accept a film can't please everyone and some people have issues with some aspects of storytelling that they may not...they instead feel forced to demonise those who feel differently to them, so they may look down upon them and feel superior on the internet''

There was a lot of attention to detail... except when there wasn't. There was a lot of tension and suspense and then it relies on a cheap useless jump-scare.

 What we do know is that the aliens wiped out almost all of humanity. so it would take longer than a year and a half for Jimothy to make the perfect trap while never making any noise. as well as having to provide for his family and protect them. he doesn't get to just take an hour out of his day to go grocery shopping, he has to collect the food himself, he has to dispose of his families shit, go on supply runs etc, all while remaining silent

he spent the year and a half making the area he lives in as safe as possible. setting up the lights that can be turned red when its dangerous, painting the spots you can walk on that wont make the floor creek, creating a soundproof barbecue, etc, all while remaining silent. he also spent a lot of time teaching his kids how to stay safe as well, all while remaining silent. the reason he didn't spend a year and a half making traps that wont work is cause he didn't have time to. and again, do you really think that the VC were able to make those traps while remaining silent the entire time? this is all easier said than done",8a5qdo

dyia8a5,"Hey. Don’t be a jerk by using personal attacks. You don’t know about me or the scope of my imagination. 

And since you asked, these are my main gripes:  


-	Don’t worry about dealing with that nail for the entire year+ you’ve been walking down those stairs.  It’s probably too hard to abate that risk when you’ve spent so much time using your little brain on much more difficult problems. 
-	A shotgun blast in the basement brought the aliens coming, but I guess they were all sleeping the night before when the fireworks show was taking place. You’re telling me that the farm wouldn’t have been absolutely overrun at that point?
-	Also, those kids should probably get a pass because, you know, kids... but fuck that shit. Your survival depends on maintaining emotional control, and childish shit is gonna get you killed. You gotta start stuffing a rag in your kid’s mouth and slapping them around until they submit fully. I never thought I’d say such a thing, but this is survival... their survival. 
-	I’m sure it would have just been too difficult to build a shelter near the waterfall. It would have been a terrible place for your wife to give birth. Also, why not use the river to get where you need to go? Maybe they were afraid of water. It’s much easier to find, literally, tons of sand. You chose to stay in a creaky fucking farm house?!
-	And seriously, a fucking baby?!?! You couldn’t have waited until you found a safer location? You were looking for a safer location, right? (See above)

This is just the shit that I couldn’t abide. There were PLENTY of things that I had no trouble “suspending my disbelief” on. 

I don’t give a shit about the military or the clarifying story. I didn’t need that information. I would have been fine with the sand and the baby and the huff n puff teenage runaway scene and MOST of it... but that fucking nail and those fireworks were too fucking much for me. 

So, the movie is about family... I get it.  I was interested in that. Neil Young made me smile and the dancing is real sweet. The kids had plenty of great qualities and Dad is sacrificial and believable. The vast majority of the acting is GREAT!  The premise is super cool! It’s why I went in the first place. 

All of that being said, add enough unbelievable and ludicrous plot points to an interesting and moving story, and you’ve got a shitty movie. 

I quickly found myself cheering for the aliens and praying for the slaughter of a family. Why did you do this to me John Krasinski?

\-Worse parents ever. Never mind not having children in those circumstances, don't have em at all? Why would you bring a four year old with you on a scavenging trip? Okay, let's say you have to. Why the hell would he not be under your supervision 100&#37;. He should have been walking between mom and dad, not trailing twenty feet behind.

additionally:

\- dad takes timid boy scavenging. Leaves strong willed, strong minded kid behind because reasons.

\- Why was the lid off the baby's box in the water?

\- How the hell did dad not realize all that water was rushing out? and how do you not do a perimeter check with your helpless baby and post-birth wife sitting right below?

\- Why do the kids even need dad to rescue them? Why not, I dunno, camp out on the tower until daybreak and just make your way back on your own. They should have a bunker down policy at night. Wait until day.

\- The kid running through the cornfield. I get it, he's a kid, he's timid, but with so much other hard to suspend stuff going on, once he started running I could only groan. The absolute worst choice he could make.

\- If these things are that reliant on sound they'd be stupid easy to fool. It'd be like the first jurassic park. You make a sound, shit, but you just toss something in another direction (preferably something that'd make a lot of sound) then stand still.

Yeah you're right there was the word sound in a different quadrant, but the word ""weakness????"" was in an entirely different quadrant, they didnt know the weaknesses yet, just that they can hear and are blind.    
    
To say that a plot hole is that ""how can they not know that is the weakness it was staring them right in the face"" is kind of unfair.

If the red lights were for a generic ""I dun goofed and made a big noise"", then it wouldn't make sense for the only switch to be located in the basement. As crazy-prepared at the dad is, he would have a switch in every room. Having one main switch indicates that it's there to serve a specific purpose.

Obviously that purpose is to indicate that the fireworks need to be set off, but setting off so many fireworks at once? If it was just a general noise, setting off one would be enough. Setting off multiple means that you don't know when the noise from the house is going to happen, or that it's going to be happening continually for a short period of time.

Additionally, this isn't an easy setup to reset. You've got to collect a lot more fireworks, and that's not a good long-term solution, especially since we don't ever see them collecting materials for gunpowder to make more. This setup is definitely for a one-time event.

This even might explain why the daughter (/kids?) aren't allowed in the basement. The dad wants no false positives on this, because if the fireworks get set off while she's not in labor, that's a guaranteed death sentence later on.

You're misinterpreting. This movie is average 7/10 at very best. The score is awful and distracting. Beyond tension and the dynamic between the father and daughter there really isn't any other substance, and there are *real* issues with logic, like how they can slam a truck door without attracting monsters. Once you've seen the film a couple of times it fails to offer much because a lot of the tension relies on not knowing what happens next. This film used visual storytelling beautifully, but a lot of the visuals themselves are pretty bad. The color palate was pretty flat, the cinematography was uninspired for the most part, and most of the CGI was terrible. They gave away pretty much all the suspense of the movie when they showed a full body shot of the monster in the first 10 minutes, and the alien's design was pretty unoriginal and not particularly scary.

What do you mean true protection, the same was to deserves the noise of any footsteps. My only real issue with the sand was where he keeps getting it.

>Having a baby?

Probably an accident, probably didn't have the morale to abort, and probably wanted to fill the hole left from the other kid dying.

>Not sound proofing the entire house?

Soundproof with what? Filling it all with sand? Probably a good idea but maybe the magic sand pit only puts out a little bit.

>Bringing the kids along to get provisions etc.? Quite dumb, especially at the beginning.

Kids are stupid sure, but the house would've been wrecked from those aliens if the kids had been left at home. Also they have to learn how to scavenge, and the parents were probably terrified to be separated. The movie starts only a few months after the initial invasion.

>Letting the son fall/walk behind in the first place? Why? He's like 4 and he obviously doesn't understand the dangers.

They weren't focused on the kid because they didn't think he brought the root, and he seemed to know to stay on the sand. They were probably turning to check on him frequently and the kids decided to pull out the toy after he thought they were not paying attention.

>Not having noise traps set up around the property

I think this is more because wind could or animals or something could set them off and draw attention to the property.

In a verbal discussion, that kind of response is acceptable, because it's reasonable to get the wrong idea about what someone just said, especially if they said a lot of things at once. People make mistakes and accidentally misrepresent someones view, and then they can be immediately corrected. You don't have that excuse. You can't misrepresent my statements without intentionally doing so, which is a very dishonest thing to do. I get why you'd do it, don't get me wrong.

Nah, in reality, you defeated a caricature of a person with whom you disagree, and **who you created**.

I gotta give it to you, though. The cognitive dissonance you're showing is way up there. To recap: I gave an opinion about a movie, then you intentionally lie about my views, then attack me personally, then I tell you that you are rude (because it's rude to lie about people and attack them) then you tell me that I'm a hypocrite for calling you rude. If it's hypocritical to call someone rude, who's lying about you and attacking you without provocation, then I would like to know what's *not* hypocritical.

Oh and the manliness line is great too. First, it's just hilarious that you'd call someone over the Internet unmanly; the irony is priceless. Second, you'll have to explain again why it's unmanly to not let people get away with lying about you and attacking you.

That would surely make it easier to hear a lantern falling and breaking or a person crying out from stepping on a nail. Neither of those sounds are all that minor, glass breaking is decently loud especially when everything else in the house is quiet and again the doors are open, and I've stepped on a nail before and while I wasn't trying to stifle the cry when it happened I don't think I would have been able to stay quiet enough to not be heard if I had been in this situation. 

Also, I get not wanting to suspend disbelief much and wanting the movie to cover all its potential plotholes, but at the end of the day you have to decide if you want to be ""no fun allowed"" or if you want to concede a few things for the good of enjoying the story for what merits it does have. The briefness of the mother's labor was a far bigger plothole/inaccuracy than the potential for noises in the home to have not been heard, and yet I still forgive it because the only way that the birth could have been portrayed realistically (barring some really jarring editing/pacing) is if the movie had a much longer runtime or if the story had been done as a TV miniseries

It's also implied that there are an insane number of the things. They confirmed that at least three were in their area alone, which implies they saw three at once. And the shotgun blast proves just how many were in the surrounding forest to get there so quickly. And that's just one section of forest. We know from their efforts with the radio that the entire world had gone dark. There's got to be hundreds of thousands, or even millions of them across the planet.

So compare their sheer ferocity, near total immunity to weapons, and likely insane numbers, to the fact that the first scene of the movie isn't even three months after the things arrived.

If you’d like to do further research on this and figure out which lighting actually made sense and which didn’t, then be my guest. And this really only applies to the board-game scene. Because the post-birth hideout being lit only by candles makes complete sense. But in the end, you can just shoot all this down and make an argument that being a post-apocalyptic world, electricity could fail intermittently.

A rusty pickup truck provided fleeting protection until the father sacrificed himself, and an escape could be made. Everyone, especially  the characters, recognized that the pickup truck wouldn’t work much longer. I mean, that was very clear. 

Again, I’m not saying this film is devoid of inconsistencies. But the ones you’ve addressed so far, save for the grain bin, are easily argued against. And to call them plot *holes* is more than a stretch. 

I get that it’s popular to bash on illogical things done in horror movies, but think of counter arguments, too.

Every family member contributed to the events that transpired. The son's cowardice is the reason he didn't wait where he was supposed to. The daughter's self-loathing is why she left the house. She probably would've died if she had stayed though. The mother gets pregnant then fails to accurately predict when she will go into labor. And the father's overprotectiveness is the reason neither of his children know what to do when shit hits the fan anyway.

But none of this is relevant. You're point is that his death was preventable. The only way to prevent his death is to rewrite the entire script such that it removes all tension. Sure they could've stayed in the basement for 90 minutes eating canned food, but who would pay money to see that? 

And to say I have yet to rebut your argument is a moot point because you claim his death was preventable, yet you never explain how it could've been prevented.

I don't know any about the sound wave spectrum either. But it's clear the film was trying to communicate that a parent's love isn't always perfect.

 I got the impression either the audience was possibly meant to have forgotten about the hearing aid/not realised it's effectiveness yet (though that would be a bit ridiculous of the writers) or perhaps much more likely, that the script went through a bunch of rewrites and the fathers death by yelling to save his family was in a previous draft that didn't involve them being safe all along due to the hearing aid...but that they liked the imagery so much they chose to keep it, despite it being a bit of a peculiar action in that context.

Even using a sound source and then taking them out with a high-power weapon would seem possible.  In other words, their almost-involuntary reaction to sound would seem to be an exploitable weakness.

This area of discussion also points out other inconsistencies in the creatures' behavior for me.  For example, the creatures seem to be totally ""blind"" except for detection of strong sounds and they don't seem terribly bright at being able to differentiate among those sounds.  Seems like that would keep them pretty busy just mindlessly reacting to loud sounds.

Their reaction to those sounds also seems somewhat inconsistent and strange.  As you point out, much of the time they seem to just automatically destroy the thing causing the sound.  At other times, like with the boy at the beginning, there seems to be some implication of capturing (to eat?).  What causes those differences in reaction - particularly given the inconsistency with which they react to living and non-living sound sources?

Heart beats are quieter than breaking glass. Does that need to be explained to you?

There are multiple noises competing for the monster's attention. Every scene where it's ambiguous as to what the monster is listening to is followed by a shot from the monster's perspective, thereby explaining what it was hearing. 

This last point makes it clear you weren't paying attention. The monster's claws stab holes through the truck like it's butter. It has no reason to get inside the truck because for all it knows the truck itself was making the noise. There's also the fact that most living creatures won't intentionally destroy the ground beneath them to avoid falling. The monster is blind, if you remeber. It does the exact same thing to the door in the corn silo. It cuts through the silo wall because a wall is a vertical surface. It can cut through it without falling down. 

This is the reason you're receiving down votes. You're contributes nothing but lazy criticism based on semi-false information. 

The only plot holes I caught were the racoons surviving so long and the kids slamming the truck doors near the end. Sinking in corn is possibly a plot hole as generally speaking that should only happen if thr silo is draining from the bottom, but apparently this can happen without draining. But that doesn't explain why they stop sinking once thr monster comes, or why the monster doesn't sink. These are actual plot holes.

What kind of concessions or determinations do you make when one member of your family puts the rest of your family at risk? Does everyone have to die to save the one? Or does the one become expendable for the rest. Or are they removed before becoming a liability? How, as a parent, do you come to that decision? How do you handle being logical if it means becoming cold. How do you live with that? The same can be said for sex. Sure, they need some pleasure in the middle of the shit. But it’s irresponsible to put everyone at that level of risk.

RE the plot holes, I'm not even really sure if your serious. You don't think people can be quiet when having sex? Sure it's not as fun but if you can't even imagine it (this is kind of offensive and for that I apologize but I can't think of a nice way to phrase this) I question whether your understanding of sex comes from pornography or real life.

RE the military, our military is pretty much shock and awe, and loud explosions probably were not the best thing to combat the creatures. We also don't know the scale of the invasion, if its 5 of these things per square mile or thousands, but we know it took less than 3 months for society to fail. If you're interested in thought experiments about how close to complete collapse our country would be if something interrupted supply lines to major cities I can recommend some books. Suffice to say, no trains/cargo trucks would make it very far as they chugged down the tracks/roads making horrible noises all day. Things would collapse *very* quickly.

RE the gore, the creatures are hunting for food, which explains part of it. I wouldn't find it strange if people fled all urban centers knowing the monsters were attracted to sounds either. I'd definitely avoid the supermarket, which is what we see of ""towns"" in the first 3 months where the youngest  son dies. In the second case it's been more than a year and decomposition can largely account for the deceased in the upstate ny area.

As far as the feet being shredded, people actually run miles on asphalt with bare feet with no problems. I know this because I used to do it, and my feet were tough when I was at my height. It's called barefoot running. My feet were tough enough within 2-3 months of regular 5k runs to not worry about even road debris such as broken glass cutting me, but I digress.

RE the white dirt they laid everywhere, that was ash. Probably from the fire they lit every night on top of the grain silo to signal the nearby settlements. Based on the way it burned it was not simply a lighter fluid fire. Being they are in upstate ny, it could also be ash from a hearth they light for warmth in the winter (it gets quite cold up there). As far as miles long, we don't have a good concept of the distances based on the movie, but their farm is not really that large (you can see most of it during short pans throughout the daylight hours prior to the attack, and the path of the old pickup which is rolling in neutral after the father is killed). The deaf girl makes the trek to the bridge pretty quickly based on the time of day she just stayed there for several hours, as evidenced by placing the toy rocket down during daylight, then cutting to it being evening when she sees the rocket and runs back. She arrives only shortly after the son hides under the tractor as well, so it's not really that far at all.

As far as the cliches, what I'm trying to say is that its the interactions between the characters that are not cliche, not their actions. If you want to talk about cliche movies, the horrors you listed are full of horror cliches so I'm not sure what's upsetting you about it. All stories are just rehashed.

My honest assessment of the reason you disliked the movie is because you feel duped into going to something that seemed like it might be a gory horror movie but was in fact a nuanced psychological horror/thriller. There's fairly ample evidence about why the things you criticized exist if you watched the movie / have a wide range of experiences. Perhaps if you refocused your thoughts on viewing the movie from its merits instead of viewing it as a failed gory horror movie you can enjoy it with the rest of us.

Otherwise I hope you don't feel too wronged by it. I thought it was rather good and I'm not really a big fan of the horror genre because ironically I find it too cliched, jump scares don't impress me, and I pretty much immediately discount gore because I'm too hyper-aware that it's just special affects (too much time on the internet).

dxh841y,"Not totally sure based on the articles I read but I think it's possible that their planet was destroyed/blown up and a chunk of that planet (with some of these creatures still on it) is the asteroid that hit earth.

Found one article about it. Here's some of the specific quotes:

>**They are absolutely aliens. They’re from another planet. Where I developed the idea of them and what I wanted them to look like was most alien movies are about takeovers, agendas, they’re a thinking alien creature, and for me this idea of a predator, this idea of a parasite, this idea of something that is introduced into an ecosystem [was interesting]. One of my favorite movies I love to watch is RocknRolla and they tell that whole story about the crawfish in the Thames and that’s what I mean, the introduction of something that can’t be held back.”**

and

>**“I remember a terrible joke that I said was it would be—it’s disgusting and disturbing but it’s true—it would be like releasing wolves into a day care center. That’s how the world responds.”**

and

>**“The idea behind all that is they’re definitely aliens and they’re an evolutionarily perfect machine. So the idea is if they grew up on a planet that had no humans and no light then they don’t need eyes, they can only hunt by sound. They also develop a way to protect themselves from everything else so that’s why they’re bulletproof and all these things. I had to make it make sense. I needed the rules of the monster to adhere as tightly to the rules of the family. The family, we had set up all these incredible rules, and I needed the monster to not just be convenient.”**

and

>**“And the other idea was [the armor is] also the reason why they were able to survive kind of the explosion of their planet and then survive on these meteorites, because they’ve evolved to be bulletproof. Until they open themselves up to be vulnerable, they’re completely invulnerable.”**

and

>**“That horrible joke of the wolves in the daycare center is like, it happened so fast there is no—I wanted to break all the rules or the conventions that I had seen in alien movies which is like a speech from the president and people deciding how to survive. There was no deciding, it just happened so fast that you either survived or you didn’t. So it puts these people in a really tense place.”**

I'd hazard a guess it was like he and his neighbors had been ""discussing"" it very likely close to when the entire thing started and just sort of left it there after. 

So imagining the neighbors all got together to ""discuss"" what to do (very likely coming to the Abbot farm because of his Radio).   It's likely nobody else knew American Sign Language, and so they used the board as a way to communicate quietly.  Once they all collected enough info to learn what would work, or wouldn't, everyone goes back home to live.  Interesting touch was using the signal fires as life beacons at intervals to notify everyone all is good (something a lot of people in remote mountainous regions do, keeping a lamp burning each night to indicate they are okay, nice touch) and live their lives best as possible.  

By the time we reach the scene we see the whiteboard, it probably would make too much noise to both erase and reuse it, so he just sort of leaves it there.  

Also take note he moved a notebook that had a bit of writing in it sitting on top of a lot of the papers.  It seems to me with paper and writing implements and the whiteboard available, an efficient way they could have communicated with everyone is wife and husband switching off who would read and write responses to the neighbors while the other wrote on the board for everyone to see and they would use ASL between them to keep it as quiet as possible.

In terms that it is a sense yes. However it wouldn't be unreasonable that an alien creature may not actually have any issue with pitch or volume of sound, in terms of it's operation.

---

At which point the only way to use their sensitivity to sound against them is in the avoidance strategies that they used in the movie.

Which as I said early is all about decieving not about attacking.

They kept everything silent so that they weren't distinugishable from any other sounds.

They used louder sounds to distract(Which still has the negative effect of them prowling around afterwards as we saw)

Just because they were good at hearing sounds, doesn't automatically mean that is where their greatest weakness lies. It was for the movie.

Well, you are right, except the implant does generate an analog voltage, and we don't know what kind sensory perception the monster has. All we know is that the monster was somehow susceptible to that particular device after he had modified it with high frequency amplifiers of some sort. Electronic devices CAN make noise by the way, even without a speaker element. Think back to the old high pitched whine on CRT monitors.

With helicopters and such, you'd still have to land eventually, and how would you land without having a horde of those things on you? You'd have to somehow wipe out every single one, and if their hides are semi-bullet proof (they're alien, so we don't know what their skin is made of) it'd be a tough go for sure. You can't just bomb indiscriminately either.

Also; theyre farmers! Assuming it's a rural area in general, these are men and women who know how to support themselves off the land and work with their hands and solve problems.

I wouldn't go so far as to say it was your *fault*. It's just a movie after all. But I think it's an issue when the biggest criticism of a high-concept horror movie is that is uses the tropes defined by the genre. If the horror genre can't use its own tropes, then it ceases to be horror.

When I paid for my movie ticket the only thing I wanted was to have a story just deep enough to make me care when the jump-scares happened. I tend to compare every horror film to Alien (1979), which is chalk full of moronic decisions, but it had enough story to get you invested and ultimately make the viewer scared. I thought a few of the jump-scares (in A Quiet Place) were unapologetically stupid. Like the Emily Blunt jump scare, or the one kid grabbing the other sibling jump scare. But a lot of them were actually pretty damn effective because the source of the scare was the actual antagonist. Most horror movies will overrely on the shitty, inconsequential jump-scares.

Yet there's a group of (semi-organized? at least they light fires together) survivors within close proximity to the main character's homestead. Was the old man in the woods one of the fire-lighters from earlier in the film? How coordinated were the survivors beyond just letting each other know they're ""still around""?

This isn’t meant to be a lightbulb moment and it shouldn’t be treated as such. The parents know how this works and that has gotten them this far but because of their current situation (baby on the way like super quick) they have to take extreme measures. Examples of them already knowing how this works would be the timer Mz Tuna uses or the fact that Big Tuna set up fireworks as an emergency distraction. But this is a little kid we’re talking about. He knows it’s really fucking dangerous out there and it scares the shit out of him. He is not concerned with anything except being quiet, that is until their situation forces him to have to learn these things. Furthermore the purpose of this scene isn’t to explain to the son that the river is loud. This scene is a character building moment. Taking a young scared boy and teaching him to be brave because you know that one day very soon could be your last. It is a terribly desperate situation to be in but the boy has to learn and he has to learn quick. That is the mindset. Ultimately I would say that once you realize that the sole purpose of this scene isn’t to be a teaching moment to the audience through the boy, as much as it is meant to show you how desperate their current predicament is, it is difficult to call it anything other than creative and beautiful storytelling, but impossible to call it lazy exposition.

dxmlne9,"I agree with you...hence my comment about my concerns being trivial. But, I think having the pregnancy storyline amplified all the other “minor” plot points because it forces you to be skeptical of the parents choices from the get-go. If you do it enough, then you end up being skeptical of the movie, and aside from typical internet “snark,” I do feel that’s why you see the same criticisms from everyone.

For me, if you were going to have the pregnancy storyline, I feel like they should have condensed the timeline to where they only find out she is pregnant a few months after the aliens attacked. That way it just became an organic terrifying complication, instead of a bewildering plot point of choosing to have another child in the face of the what they already knew. 

In general, I don’t mind people pointing out plot holes. For me, if a movie is good, it stands up despite the plot holes it may have or people constantly pointing them out. One of my favorite movies is “sunshine,” and yes, the 3rd act is messy and filled with plot holes. I still don’t care. The first 2/3 & ending are so transcendent to me that the movie still holds up. 

For me, the pregnancy aspect is plot hole, but I think it can lead to a discussion about how after a child loss, many families try to have a child to kind of mitigate the loss for a variety of reasons. John Krasinski said he set out to make a family drama, not a horror film. In that vein, then, the pregnancy plot point makes sense to me. All the other questions I raised I think could be answered with the perspective of the movie being a family drama primarily. The nail pointing sharp end up is less defensible but it is what it is...shit happens. 

So, yeah, just posting “why didn’t they...” points probably is lazy criticism, but I think it’s still good to raise the questions because it can hopefully elevate the conversation to bring up perspectives that may not be intuitive after watching the movie.

Also, having the baby by the waterfall is problematic for them probably because a) getting the baby back from the waterfall safely is a huge risk since it can cry at any moment, and b) I'm pretty sure she went into labor far earlier than expected (they had shown the due date), so her being in labor at that moment threw them all for a loop, hence why shit hit the fan.",8a5qdo

And I totally can see where you're coming from in the sense that if people just parrot the same lazy criticism it stifles any real discussion on a movie. Or, as you said, a criticism that has a clear answer in the movie. I feel the same way about reddit's weird obsession with the blue and orange posters after that 1 post. Also, I agree 100% on the monster design themselves. Uninspired was the word I used I think, and showing them so early in the movie was lame, I was almost hoping for a ""It Comes at Night"" type twist where they never showed it or something spooky like that.

Not to hammer on a single point but to use the monsters taking over for example, them being bullet and bomb proof I will give you that. But invading in large numbers, multiple meteors, meteors causing an extinction event? Do you have any actual proof from the movie? The newspapers in the background referenced a single meteor. I don't know how to phrase this without sounding like a dick, so please don't take it that way but, when I read your explanations, they seem like you're working hard to fill in those gaps so the movie doesn't have to. Like, it was never stated in the movie (from my recollection) how many monsters there were, or whether or not the meteor was an extinction level event. And beyond that, how could the monsters move so quickly from continent to continent? How come Jim Halpert couldn't create a speaker system? I mean, he had a radio, a CCTV network, they even scavenged a motherboard looking thing and he said it might, ""boost the signal for the radio"". From my perspective, the movie never tried to explain how that could be in a the realm of possibility which is my reason for why I don't quite agree with you. I'm not ignoring parts of the movie to validate my criticism, it just doesn't exist and relies on me creating a reason for the movie. I'll be willing to admit that I may be wrong but I tried googling around a bit and couldn't find any real proof of what you claimed.

Not just a plain speaker, but a sound trap. Since it is one of the first obvious (to some i guess) lines of defence in this universe... to lure the sound hunter away from your camp. It needs to be shown to NOT work. This forms the explanation as to why people are not using sound creators everywhere so they can live with less fear. They even do this themselves with fireworks and the timer... so why aren't they doing this more??? Walk silently down the road. find a car. put a brick on the horn and take cover. walk silently down the road to a car within earshot. fire off horn and take cover. Rinse and repeat.

dxccrjm,"For the love of god.   

There are **multiple** scenes in the movie where the monster is less than 5 feet away and the character is doing muffled but quite obvious noises be it heavy breathing, walking, crying (the baby at least). For example do you agree that running through a corn field, with all the noise that produces (which we as audience can hear) doesn’t attract the monster? Not really anyway given that the kid run through the field (apparently fast enough to evade the thing) then banged on something and no monster ate it? I’m absolutely positive that sounds like these are extremely more audible than the frequency emitted by a light bulb which according to the mythos if the movie would be disregarded as background noise.  

Stuff like that. Ok **obviously** the muffled sounds are audible to the audience, one could argue, for dramatic effect. Which means that the movie breaks its own rules to make you tense.  That’s just poor direction.   

People in slasher movies do the wrong thing all the time but that’s part of the genre because slashers are semi comedies. Survival movies are not. In any case my cats have much more accrue hearing than the monsters within the movies set of rules.   

Anything can be argued to be a feature and not a plot hole. Literally. That’s doesn’t make suspension of disbelief less hard if you have half a brain.   

For example in a movie like “the ring” where the premise is completely ridiculous I wouldn’t expect the characters to realize that they could at least extend their life by showing the vhs one another every six days. And I don’t expect that (and are able to immerse in the movie) because it’s a movie about a kid crawling out of a tv.   

It’s not something humans had to deal with for the first 180.000 years or our existence. Because you know bears and lions could hear us, smell us *and* see us and our defense capabilities against them where far less capable that our defenses against those monsters.  If that monster had could be delayed enough from the pick up truck it stood no chance agains even the most basic of fortifications. I mean bears would fuck that car up just as easy. Don’t believe me? Google it.

dxiwuvt,"> Heart beats are quieter than breaking glass. Does that need to be explained to you?

You misread my statement, they heard glass breaking MILES AWAY. Surely they can hear a heartbeat right next to them? Plot hole.

>There are multiple noises competing for the monster's attention. Every scene where it's ambiguous as to what the monster is listening to is followed by a shot from the monster's perspective, thereby explaining what it was hearing.

This still doesn't explain why the monsters can hear a glass shattering from miles away, and not hear a heart beat 1 feet away from them.

> There's also the fact that most living creatures won't intentionally destroy the ground beneath them to avoid falling. The monster is blind, if you remeber. It does the exact same thing to the door in the corn silo. It cuts through the silo wall because a wall is a vertical surface. It can cut through it without falling down.

What? LMFAO That make absolutely no sense, you're explanation for the monster not tearing the car apart is ""living creatures are afraid of falling"". Did you not watch the movie? Because it's pretty clear to me now you're just making shit up for the sake of your already flawed and fallacious argument. 

The monster knew there was something in the truck, it wasn't attacking the truck it was trying to get in it. If the monster was attack the truck and afraid of ""falling"" then surely the father wouldn't have to sacrifice himself? The monster was afraid of falling, it wouldn't tear through the car and kill the children.

How are my criticisms ""lazy""? I gave a well thought out inductive , with premises and a conclusion. You on the other hand, instead of proving me wrong with factual evidence to support your claims made shit up to promote your false narrative.

You lost this argument before you even began, both comments are riddled with fallacies and ad hominem. The movie was bad and filled with inconsistencies without explanation, in my opinion.

I understand not wearing clogs or high heels in a world were silence is paramount, but some basic foot protection is necessary and logical. This was one of many examples in the film were the writers cared less about world building than about setting up jump-scare scenes.  

I really wanted to love this movie because the silence concept has such brilliant potential for the medium. If the story had been handled by better writers, it could have gone down in horror movie history as one of the all-time greats. Instead, the lazy writing turned into just another run-of-the-mill, by-the-numbers shlock film. It'll be forgotten once the hype fog lifts.

And BTW I didn't turn on my phone until the credits rolled. First thing I googled was ""Do cochlear implants have the same feedback issues as hearing aids?"" because it really, really bothered me to think the writers could have been so lazy to ignore a technical issue so crucial to the plot. Turns out of course they were that lazy. Hearing aids work as sound amplifiers, which is why they're at such risk for high-frequency feedback loops. Cochlear implants don't work by amplification though--they translate air vibration directly into electronic signals. Meaning there was no way the deaf girl would have heard an amplification loop from her own device. The writers were too lazy to do a 10-second Google search!

Ok, so to kill the aliens, Regan's cochlear implant (and, yes, it was a cochlear implant, not a hearing aid. A cochlear implant has an ear piece and a magnetic ""button"" that sticks to a processor under the skull) emits this high pitched sound which is further amplified when Regan puts her CI's in front of a microphone. A CI does not have any sort of speaker. It only has a microphone to gather the sound to then send electronically through the processor implanted in the brain. Again, I reiterate, a CI does not emit sound to anyone BUT the person with the processor that was surgically implanted under their skull. I can suspend disbelief if the whole ""let's put my CI's in front of the microphone"" thing hadn't happened - maybe the alien has the ability to pick up radio waves like the processor implanted in Regan's brain... but then she goes and sticks it in front of the microphone. Bull shit. It was also argued to me that whatever Lee did to ""rig"" the CI basically added a speaker to it... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? Why would they want something to emit a sound?!

I don't think the speaker thing would work. Just my opinion, but: 

1) upon setting it up, even if they eventually started to ignore it, when it first started playing you'd attract tons of them and there's no reason for us to think they'd ever leave the area. They might even wander into your house just by accident while exploring. So, you'd have a bunch of them potentially in your vicinity so if you ever left the protection of the speaker for supplies  you'd be screwed.

2) If you were to ever run out of power or fuel for the generator or whatever, you'd have no protection AND have a bunch of them around. If you ever had to turn it off and turn it on again, you'd attract them all over again.

3) You'd have to have it right over your house, the waterfall seemed to work because they were drowning in the sound by being right inside it. So having it at the edge of the property wouldn't protect you, because any sound from your house could probably be distinguished from the sounds of the speaker. Which leads me to ...

4) If all goes according to plan and it works flawlessly, you'd be living with a blaring speaker 24/7 for the rest of your life. You'd go insane I think.

We know for a fact they don't eat their kills.

If intelligence is the capacity to improve at specific objectives then the monsters meet that definition for silencing their environment. My evidence is their hostile take over of the planet.

See above comment.

Like I said, I don't think we're shown enough of the monster to determine a clear pattern of behavior. It seems to me each time one of the humans narrowly escaped their was enough plausible deniability as to whether anyone was even there. The only exception is when the boy runs through the crop, but the monster that comes to,investigate that is warded off by the girl's hearing aide.

Also, not ""filling in"" those moments doesn't always mean it's lazy writing. Everybody will have a different idea about what they think is plausible.

> I don't know how to phrase this without sounding like a dick, so please don't take it that way but, when I read your explanations, they seem like you're working hard to fill in those gaps so the movie doesn't have to.

I think those pointing out all of these ""plot holes"" are also working just as hard to quantify why they didn't like the movie, but doing so with elements that were largely unimportant, especially in the fictional horror genre. Any fictional monster movie can be picked apart just as much, yet A Quiet Place seems to be getting disproportionately more of that ""criticism"". What about zombies? Quarantine protocols? If they're dumb and single-minded, why not dig trenches of napalm for them to walk into? Do you expect a scientific explanation for how zombies can even exist in every one of those movies? No. It's usually more about the horror and people trying to cope with it. The further down the ""well, this monster ability should have been explained more"" argument you get, the further you are from the ""point"" of the movie.

> relies on me creating a reason for the movie

Some movies do that, especially for parts that aren't really the focus of the movie. Sometimes, it's done intentionally to create mystery or room to explore later.

We all have different preferences/experience. You might have wanted more of those explanations, while others are totally fine with what they got, likely because they were following along (e.g. ""OMG are they going to smother this baby?"") instead of stopping to nitpick (e.g. ""It can't get through this truck?""). We'll probably just have different opinions about whether breaks in suspension of disbelief are the movie's fault or viewer's fault.

The creatures seemed able to claw through steel, judging by the silo. And while underground sounds like a good idea, that leaves you with only one or two exits as opposed to an above-ground place where you have several more exit routes.


The monsters could probably be killed by tank or rockets, but the movie is set in the middle of buttfuck nowhere, so not a lot of military armaments there.

dxcfohb,"Well I don’t know if you’ve ever gone through a corn field but, depending on how fast you’re moving, you shake every single corn stalk withing a 5-10 ft radius. I don’t know how well the monsters’ hearing triangulated sound but I’d say it’d be difficult to pinpoint the source of this sound if the monster itself was running through the field after it, much as the movie establishes that louder noises tend to diffuse sound enough that it’s difficult for the monsters to identify a victim. Corn fields are very loud and throw noises. I used to hike through cornfields with my friends when we were younger to get to the woods that we liked to explore, and we both had to stop moving or full on yell to each other just to be able to hear. 

What could be *better* argued about this scene is why the kid ever diverted off the path to run through the cornfield in the first place. But again, I’ll chalk that up to irrational decisions made in terrifying situations. 

I’d have to rewatch the film, but I’m almost positive that the reason the creature was slowly closing in on Blunt’s character was due to her breathing, and there were obvious attempts to make he remain completely silent when it was coming up behind her while she was in the tub. Again, I’m not sure how this is even a plot hole in your eyes. It was a significant scene for the climax of that momentary tension, and momentarily relieved by the distraction of the fireworks. 

People in ALL horror movies do the wrong thing all the time, and people in real life do the exact same thing. I work on an ambulance dude, I see it all the time. People with no training, placed in even *minor to moderately* stressful situations, can completely lose all rationality and behave in baffling ways. I’m not sure why you claim this is an element of comedy. This is how real humans behave in real life stressful situations. That’s not even debatable. 

If you’re going to delve this deep into the mythos of the film to reach for plot holes, then please don’t be shocked when I counter it with film mythos. **Again, I’m not claiming that the writers of the film had these specific things in mind** when they wrote about a kid running through a cornfield, or someone hiding in a truck, because **again, I’m not claiming this movie is completely consistent and flawless.** But the mythos of the film does not contrast its possibility. So if you want to make these arguments using this method, please don’t attempt to insult my intelligence for using the same method to counter them. 

And back to the rusty truck. Mind you the creature is blind, and shattered the windows the first time he touched it. I doubt the creature, with its alien mind, was thinking “awe damn I should just get the doors and windows out of the way then I can crawl in and kill the makers of the noise.” No, the noise was coming from *inside* the truck. The creature had no way of knowing that. When he got ahold of the truck, it could have thought it had the source of the noise, and began stabbing and slashing at it to try to get the noise to stop. There’s was no way for it to know that he source was actually something inside. 

The really sad part about all of this is that it seems like you’re *reallllllllllly* reaching for something to shit on this movie for, and when I counter these things, it seems like you’re getting *reallllllllllly* pissed off at me for having a defense. Which really confuses me. 

What’s motivating you to behave this way? Did something upset you about the movie so now you have to desperately search for every potential flaw? Are you working for the idiots at CinemaSins? Are you one of *those* people that has to shit on anything that the majority of other people like? 

I’m honestly confused. Did these minor things honestly make you think the movie was bad, and is that why you’re getting so upset when I dispute them?

""vicious ad hominem attacks""


In order to use the ad hominem fallacy, a personal attack needs to be used in lieu of an argument. In all of my comments I cite text from the film as evidence for my argument. Then I added a comment that if someone wants to make factually correct criticisms they need to represent the events of the film as the actually occurred. So even if you interpret that remark as a personal attack, which it isn't, it still isn't ad hominem because it is not presented in lieu of an argument. 

I say again, if you want to criticize someone else's logic, it helps you a lot to have a logical criticism. At this point you are just using words you don't even know the definition of. The true irony is that you presumably read the whole comment thread and still fail to grasp this.

The fact of the matter is that his *opinion*, as you call it, was demonstrably wrong because it neglected to mention relevant information that was in the movie. But I take issue with calling his original comment an *opinion*. He did not say that he didn't like that sequence, he said that it was poor writing. The term he used was *copout*. This is an objective claim, not an opinion. A plot point is either logical, or it is illogical, and that is outside the realm of opinion. I presented evidence that showed he was wrong and he got butt hurt. 

Your analogy fails when you take this into account. A more apt analogy would be to say ""It is illogical that the girl did not turn her head when her little brother turned on the rocket ship"" when everyone paying attention could tell you she didn't turn her head because she was deaf. If your *opinion* requires ignorance to make sense, then your opinion is wrong. If you consider that an ad hominem argument then *you* are the one failing to engage with the argument. ",8a5qdo

And just for some comparisons, I watched the ""The Mist"" and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" and I these types of inconsistencies didn't come to my mind like they did for Quiet Place.

As for how they would be expected to try these things, I'll just say:

- they're on a farm.  Farms can have some pretty lethal things on them (hence mi reference to a suspended tractor).  It also would be no more unreasonable for them to have a high-powered deer rifle than a shotgun.

- they seemed to have done pretty well in the technology area with the flat panels, cameras, communications gear, etc., not to mention electricity.

- the attack of the creatures seemed pretty clearly to be wide-spread, if not global, so I think it is reasonable to put this in the context of how ""humanity"" would respond, not just one rural family - and that includes the military (especially after more than a year).

And I get that people like the movie for the acting/actors, the effective use of silence/sound/deafness, and the suspense.

The explanations I gave are perfectly viable. You seem a lot more invested in disliking this movie than giving a reasoned position. You're assuming a lot about what the monster can and can't do. You don't know the monsters are miles away. For all the audience knows they could've been in the cornfield the whole time. You also don't know if the monsters even heard the glass breaking or they just heard the raccoons. If I'm injecting head canon into the narrative then so are you.

 If you can't accept that a heart beat is quieter than breaking then you're just refusing to engage with the premise of the film. The premise being that monsters hunt with sound, but this family still survived. That was the rule established by the first act. By definition a plot hole would need to violate that logic. There are valid breaks in logic which I mentioned before. What you are referring to doesn't break that established logic.

dxc785p,"I must reiterate that I have already explained why you are being down voted. Part of that explanation was how from a perfectly reasonable frame of reference  your post ignores details that would have easily addressed your listed criticisms. From that same point of reference your post is really just a wall of text between relevant content. 

There have been comments mentioning the problems this film has that were upvoted, and that's because those problems couldn't be easily explained. As far as I remember there's no clear explanation for why they have power and plumbing. The box they hide the baby in opens itself. The kids roll a truck in neutral through a bush and it doesn't seem to provoke monsters. They also close the door to the truck, which contradicts a lot of rules I'm the movie. It's also physically impossible to sink into the corn unless it's draining from the bottom. Some of the jump scares were just cheap and they revealed the monster design was waaaaaay too early which reduced the *fear of the unknown* effect this film no doubt wanted. Also the score was extremely derivative, literally the Sicario score but quieter so you can't tell they ripped it off. The score is also kind of distracting from a lot of moments that could've benefited from more silence.

Those are all my biggest problems with this movie and as far as I can tell no one can refer to any specific scene or explanation to satisfyingly address them. This makes my criticisms a lot stronger. People would not take me seriously if they could mention some detail I missed, like she opened the box before she fell asleep.

If you're going to imply someone's argument is invalid because they need multiple accounts for it to be upvoted it begs the question why you're using two accounts to post in the same comment thread.

I don't agree with his generalization. But there are a lot of people crying plot hole when in reality they just missed the explanation when it was onscreen. These people are entitled to their opinion as to whether or not they enjoyed it, but when their criticism is based on false or misleading information it calls their motivations into question.

dxk26ex,"The first time we see the monsters after the rocket kid dies they are in the cornfield right outside their house. That's hardly hundreds of feet. It's probably not even 20 yards. Based on what's actually shown in the movie your assumption has no grounds. 

There's also the fact that glass breaking is louder than a heartbeat, no matter hoe close you are. You're welcome to keep denying this, but if you're interested in logic I don't see why you would. Doctors literally need to use a stethoscope to hear your heart and your breathing. There's only one scene where a monster gets that close to a character in a quiet setting to be able to conceivably hear a heart beat, and it stabs that guy in the gut and leaves him with ribs sticking out of his abdomen.

dxh0xy4,"1) I didn't watch the trailer, they often give away far too much, I watched a few reviews from reviewers I trusted.
 
2) Even if I had seen the pregnancy in the trailer there were a number of ways the film could have made that acceptable, perhaps she was already very pregnant by the time the world fell apart? The timeline jump and day count made it clear they waited less than a year into the scenario before deciding to rear a child though, which is insane. Or they could have explained that the characters are extremely severe orthodox catholics. Or they could have had a scene with the main characters discussing and acknowledging the insanity of the choice they'd made to have a child and possibly address why they did so....as it is it's just ignored as though this is a perfectly normal decision to make...it's like deciding to adopt a puppy or buy their son a drum kit, it may make sense in our world but in theirs it's a bizarre choice that to me required some kind of acknowledgement to buy it. I think it actually could have been pretty interesting and would have fit the overall themes of the film to address the morality of this conflict.

3) I wouldn't say it alone ruined the film for me, it wasn't a terrible film, I'd give it 5/10...it was well directed, well acted and I liked the overall premise but the script was poor and full of stupid, stupid stuff that should have been worked around...the pregnancy was only one of them, I merely chimed in on this argument you were having with that guy because I thought his points were valid and you were being a bit of an aggressive dick to him unnecessarily...we're just having fun talking about a movie here, chill.

4) I'm not complaining the movie had tension, I'm complaining that for me it DIDN'T have the tension it should've had (for it to be an 8/10 movie some are already calling a classic...I felt it had enough for it to be a dumb, silly 5/10 sci fi channel original movie...I still like dumb horror films don't get me wrong, I just had higher hopes than that for this one....I wouldn't have paid to see it in the cinema otherwise).

5) You can move a plot forward in a horror film without having the characters make braindead decisions or have huge contrivances one after the other, that's the sign of sloppy writing. Or even if you have to have characters do something stupid I feel you've got to at least have others acknowledge how stupid the action is, a big part of my problem with this one is everyone acts as though it's perfectly normal and perfectly reasonable. I also find it much harder to excuse poor character choices from a film that takes itself so seriously and relies so heavily on you being invested in the short cast of characters to feel the emotional peaks and get invested in their survival. As it was my partner and I were both rolling our eyes half the time ''Oh look at that, the wife of the couple that lived in that remote house they stumbled upon in the middle of the forest survived 400+ days of the apocalypse but just so happened to be killed and have her body found by her husband the exact minute, the exact second the father was walking past taking his son on his first proper exhibition outside the farm'' lots of absurd contrivances like that, they're fine for B movie horror (as are the relentless jumpscares), I was just under the impression this was going to be more than that.

The script itself was full of amateur B movie stuff, after watching the film I went home to look up the writers and see what else they'd done....suprise surprise all their other stuff is dreadful b grade trash and MTV pilot episodes of shows that never aired. This is a case of Hollywood throwing a bunch of money at a good director and good actors but totally skimping out on the writers...It leads to a decent enough throw away horror film with an idiotic script that could have been far more. Still above average for the genre but not worth more than a 5/10 for me, there are much better versions of this out there.

I'm happy it's doing well though, hopefully it leads to more horror movies getting a proper budget in future....It would just be nice if next time they got proper writers with good experience and at least 1 passable film to their name.",8a5qdo

Now this kid suddenly makes a loud noise and doesn't even care to look at his parents (who are nearby and have forbidden him from doing so probably thousands of time till then) to see their reaction is not something that seems right to me.

dzs1sxv,"Sure I've got stuck on a problem before, and you're right that's a very human thing to do. And I understand what your saying in regards to categorising info can restrict how you think about it, but I simply do not believe that this would occur for so long with a very simple concept.  This isn’t string theory he’s formulating - it’s comic book simplicity.  Additionally:
1. They are using a board for brain storming for way of dealing with or killing the aliens – which means you should be looking at relationships between the various things you know about them
2. This is not occuring in a vaccuum, it’s not just him, there are 4 people in the house and they’ve never discussed weaknesses, sure the kids aren’t allowed down there (see pet peev below), but the wife is and she hasn’t noticed that either
3.  Writers block or becoming overly fixated on one aspect of a project usually occurs when the majority of your time and mental resources are being devoted to it.  Which can be overcome by any or all of the following:
	a.  Doing a physical task – Check, they do this daily
	b.  Doing a creative task – Check,  the solutions they have gradually implemented over the initial course of the invasion are the results of creative thinking which is by far the best thing to encourage with problem solving.
	c.  Having a sounding board – Check, his wife knows whats on the board and has the same info he has.  But the kids know all of this too, are we seriously being asked to believe that they don’t talk to their parents about the sound seeking aliens?
	d. Rest or leisure time – Check, none of them seem sleep deprived (which is surprising really) and are shown to be doing various non work related activities

My other problem is consistency, the father is shown to have enough scientific acumen and creativity to be able to keep producing new hearing aids (no simple task), and we’re expected to believe this guy has never in his life heard the phrase ""go back to the drawing board"" whilst in the presence of a literal drawing board? 

[Pet peeve about point 2. I also believe this is the entire narrative reason for not allowing the kids down there - because they would have immediately made that connection, especially the daughter. Ristricting the kids access never made sense to me considering the kids already know the worst information out there; monster aliens will hunt and kill you if you so much as fart... honestly, the amount of deflatine this family must consume should be in the kilos. 

Your final point would be described as cognitive fatigue, it's one of the reasons it's recommended to take short breaks every 20 minutes when studying, and to do it in chunks of a few hours and not for an entire day.  Cognitive fatigue is only experienced when you are actively trying solve a problem, attempting to learn something new and/or process something relatively complex.  Its' that unfamiliarity that requires a lot of energy to devise a solution for - hence the fatigue.  Once you have set up solutions and routines, like you mentioned in your points, the energy required to carry them out decreases dramitically as they become encoded in to your procedural memory (aka muscle memory, talking, riding a bike, even your morning routine, etc).  This is different according to task and person but its pretty quick process especially with that much practice and regularity.  Once you get familiar enough that you carry out these tasks largely without thinking (which they are all shown to do), you will only expend the energy to physically carry out the task, which is far less expensive and draining than when you first came up with the solution.  Whereas  this would have been an issue in the beginning, it would not have been after a few weeks, perhaps a few months, depending on task and the individual.

The more extreme of this is clinical exhaustion or burnout which I do not believe the father qualifies as, as he doesnt show any of the symptoms, and when I experienced it took a few years of high stress to begin manifest the symptoms, he has none:  
	panic attacks, cold sweats, night terrors, heart palpitations, trembling and shaking, migraines, severe insomnia, confusion & difficulty holding or even understanding a conversation, inability to concentrate on simple tasks, etc.  
	There are however numerous protective (preventative) factors:
1. Respite – he is the only one in the family that knows he can go and have a good shout in the waterfall if he needs it – must be quite nice. Secondly most people nowadays go fishing as a part of holiday so I doubt this was a particularly stressful experience for him –  and he’s pretty good at it.
2. They are surrounded by ample resources for both food and natural remedies once the pharmacy runs out – this is going to be extremely helpful as basic needs are met.
3. You are assuming that every solution implemented was the fathers, the foot prints on the steps was something I immediately looked at and thought “the middle boy would have thought of that first”.  There’s also no reason why I wouldnt have let a kid do the painting, its simple, and helps make the child feel like they can do something to control this new environment.  Secondly, most mothers I know are very capable problem solvers and are used to thinking on their feet – kids and their randomness makes it a bit of steep learning curve for new parents.
4. None of these solutions would be applied in one go, in fact a few require that you make noise to implement  so would need to be done prior to the creatures being in earshot.  And you would probably prioritise which solutions to implement according to how noisey they were.   Although I’d really like to know how they hammered that little coffin together or even cut the wood for it.
5.  Once a solution is implemented, it merely needs to be monitored and maintained, thats actually pretty boring (I worked in admin, fire safety checks are yawn!) 
6. Routine – is calming and makes peeps more efficient, it’s used in work places, prisons, education, hospitals, etc, for this reason. What they do day to day would be no different after year than any other job, so sure you’d be tired but routine tasks are the exact opposite of stressful, many people find them mind numbing others enjoy not having to think about what their doing.

I think you might be overestimating how much this all fell on the father, but thats a matter of opinion and we aren’t shown the entire timeline anyway.  I really do think however if he was that knackered then how on earth was he able to be the only member of the family to make consistently good choices?  Decision making is generally the first mental process to become compromised under stress as in involves complex thought,  the sound weakness for me seems a particularly simple concept, so again we have a internal consistency problem.

I would agree with that.

To be 100% honest, my issue isn't really with the movie's explanation of how did the aliens take over. But people are just asking questions about the film they saw. Which is completely valid. To say that, ""Not every movie needs to be a exposition-heavy, hand-holding experience"" or that ""they were following along (e.g. ""OMG are they going to smother this baby?"") instead of stopping to nitpick"" is a straw man argument. 

> A Quiet Place seems to be getting disproportionately more of that ""criticism""

Not to suddenly change the point, but very few people in this thread are seriously hating or hammering on the movie because of that monsters vs military issue. I read maybe 3 or 4 comments that said they disliked the movie specifically because of that reason and they were at -10 or something. Most of the top/best comments on this thread are people not even talking about that aspect movie. Seriously, the movie has 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, 82 on Metacritic, 8.1 on IMDB, the Rolling Stone gave it 4.5 out of 5. So this notion that you and the other user have that A Quiet Place is receiving that much ""criticism"" is laughable at best. To say that you personally are annoyed by the nitpicking or that the point of the movie is much bigger than that would be completely correct. But my biggest issue with the argument that you and the other user are presenting is that no one is **majorly** criticizing the movie. And every time someone brings up another issue they had with the movie, you and the other user just dodge the question being asked and double down on this, ""you simpletons need heavy handed exposition to hold your hand through this movie/are just trying to nitpick the movie for the sake of it"" argument. Like you and the other commenters keep on claiming that people are just trying to pretend like they're smarter than the movie maker, but next to no one is saying anything like that at all in this thread. Not a lot of people are saying, ""I would have done this"" or ""this movie failed here!"". Basically to hammer on people for asking questions about a movie they just saw feels like blowing it way out of proportion to me. Especially when people aren't really criticizing vs questioning. 

But we can agree to disagree. At the end of the day, I see a lot of reason in what you're saying in regards to the point of the movie being more ""family"" thriller vs sci-fi alien movie, and that, these issues, however big or small, don't directly detract from the movie as you watch it.

dx7p4fy,"I concede that using the term 'plot hole' was not the correct term, thank you for educating me on that. However, what the issue is, is that I am really just not understanding the actions and inactions of the family -- a lot of what happened seems to me very sub-par as a response to their situation. That's what gets me the most. 

The constant jump-scares were akin to somebody just jumping out at you and asking if that scared you -- like when the brother snatched the sister's hand after he got knocked out, or the wife's bleeding hand slamming onto the shower window and streaking blood downward just to name two. Too much of that kind of thing for my taste.

Again, they found the secret to killing them is to open their sensory organs up in their head, then shooting into it. All the world's military could not figure that out? It's absolutely not believable to me. And the daughter's hearing condition seemed to play into the movie in very much the same way the girl's asthma did in Signs as well as other related themes that seem borrowed from that movie.

I am not explaining myself properly, but the fact that it's very much fantasy is not my issue with the movie. It's how the people in this movie reacts to this fantastical reality (aliens invade and murder everyone) that doesn't play out with how the world *would have actually* responded, in my opinion. For instance the aliens also have their strength and speed reduced at certain times in order to allow the characters to escape or not be killed in that moment -- such as in the truck at the end. It was having a hard time getting through a simple window or thin sheet metal of the roof whereas in the corn silo it just tore a massive hole through it within 1 second. After the boy fell into the corn, one door was left still hinged and it was squeaking back and forth on the hinge yet the monster totally ignored that and went for the kids directly without hesitation. Or being that it has very sharp spider-like appendages to move it didn't have the same problem sinking into the corn like the kids were having. The physics there was not fair to all characters. It's little cheats like this here and there that violate it's own believably of the world created.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this comes off as a **negative criticism** concerning ""lazy"" writing in the movie in the form of unexplained events, not a ""question"". 

> the movie never really elaborated further on those issues

Nor do I think it intended to (if that wasn't obvious by its exclusion). You have to cut the movie down to something discrete/finite. Maybe your issue was with the choices made to not focus on backstory more? Valid, and while I personally wouldn't mind seeing it explored more, I wouldn't go as far as claiming that's ""lazy"".

Speaking of straw mans... I don't think I mentioned being annoyed, disagreeing that the movie doesn't elaborate on the backstory, not expecting questions, etc. More importantly, those portions of the movie were INTENDED to be filled in by the audience. Any answers they could have provided would have just resulted in more questions. The point was to bypass the tedium of non-fictional exposition to get directly into the fictional premise/setting. I'll admit, with a little tweaking (removing the newspaper snippets and maybe nerfing the monsters a bit), it might make more sense, but it might also be less of a spectacle/uncanny/scary. I'm happy with the balance they struck.

> Not to suddenly change the point, but no one in this thread is really hating or hammering on the movie because of that monsters vs military issue.

There might not be explicit connection between that specific example and their overall rating/score, but I definitely got the feeling that this criticism and others like it (based on backstory, monster abilities, pregnancy, sounds, speaker alarm systems, etc.) negatively impacted their overall impression of the movie. 

> And every time someone brings up another issue they had with the movie, you and the other user just dodge the question being asked and double down on this, ""you simpletons need heavy handed exposition to hold your hand through this movie/are just trying to nitpick the movie for the sake of it"" argument.

No. The first thing the other user did was propose solutions to your question (monster number, armor, meteorite). Then you said it wasn't in the movie. Then we effectively said ""duh, those portions are left to imagination"". Then you still felt it was lazy movie writing. I disagree. It's just a choice—you have to draw the line somewhere and I was happy with where it was. You wanted more backstory. I didn't really need more. What else is there to say here?

> Like you and the other commenters keep on claiming that people are just trying to pretend like they're smarter than the movie maker, but next to no one is saying anything like that at all in this thread. 

I didn't make any claims about viewer vs director intelligence. 

> No one is saying, ""I would have done this"" or ""this movie failed here!"". 

Yes, they are:

There are 12k+ comments in this thread. Some commenters are literally having the same arguments in other comment chains.

If your ""question"" is ""Was an explanation in the movie?"" then you've been given the answer: ""No"". You went on further to say the other commenter was ""filling stuff in"" and that makes for lazy writing. That's not a question, but I'm not really interested in belaboring that point so much that we start making generalizations and interpretations about what other commenters are saying.

I have no idea. I'm just not understanding your point. What is your point? I'm trying to make sense of it the best I can but I don't think you're understanding my point either. 

Why would we compare this film to Up, because it has similar ratings. That's why. 

> If you're telling me you can compare this film to Up then we are at an impasse.

You can compare all films. You can compare them within the genre and there some movies that transcend their own genre. Up for example. Quiet Place supposedly did. Is it a great film, or is it a great horror film. See. Two different standards. That caveat changes things. 

By saying this movie is a 10/10 is saying it's a perfect movie. If that's the rating it should be compared with other 'perfect films' otherwise you absolutely ARE grading on a curve and putting it in a box. Now if you're saying it's really just a 10/10 within the genre, there's the curve. If you're saying it should only be compared with films within the genre, there's that curve again. 

This movie was a 6/10 for a movie. It was a 9/10 for a horror movie. You're the one trying to put this movie in a box by shielding it from comparison to other movies that don't suffer from the same limitations. ",8a5qdo

dxq3in6,"Again, the amount in their immediate surroundings alone to respond to the shotgun blast would indicate there's hundreds of thousands, potentially millions, of them. There's no reason to assume the military literally never killed any of them. Just not enough.

And in real life, weapons don't have video game style flat damage values, dude. You can stab a man to death with a pencil just fine, then do absolutely nothing with said pencil to a man in riot gear. Scale that logic up to an alien killing machine. The """"""""damage"""""""" from the shotgun wasn't what killed it. Destroying its internal organs did. And unless you somehow know its exact internal structure, then you have no way of knowing how well-supported its organs are against shock from a bombshell.",8a5qdo

If he had come to the conclusion on his own, it wouldn't make sense for him to so readily abandon it and rebut with ""that's what *she* believes"".

At the risk of you crying ad hominem again I'll let you choose whichever you prefer.

If someone makes a claim that a piece of writing it *bad* because it is ""illogical"" then it is outside the realm of opinion. Ascribing logic to opinion is to make logic meaningless. The point of logic is create a discourse that is less biased by opinion. 

It seems like it needs to be said a fourth time, if you criticise logic with an illogical criticism then that criticism is bad. If you continue to disagree with that point then you may as well admit you aren't concerned with logic at all. You're just looking for an argument on the internet.
