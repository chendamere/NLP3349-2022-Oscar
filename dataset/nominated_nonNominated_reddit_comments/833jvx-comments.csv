dvfbe3i,"Saw this, twice, when it was out in the UK, and again this past week. Seriously one of the funniest films I've seen in the last decade. The danger of a dark comedy like this is that you run the danger of making light of the awful situation itself and the whole thing feels crass as a result. But with this - they never make light of the situation itself, the comedy is very much on a personal level, focusing on the people and their bickering. 

The decision not to use Russian accents was perfect, allowing them to rapid-fire punchlines without having to give the audience time to decode the accents. It also gave every joke another mini-punchline - hearing the mighty Zhukov deliver his insults in a Yorkshire accent, for example.

I wrote more about it [here](https://desecratingsyntax.wordpress.com/2017/10/13/review-the-death-of-stalin/) but that's shameless blog promotion. Absolute delight of a film.",833jvx

dvu03zp,"Funny where it needs to be, and how it needs to be given the subject matter and setting. 

I have been hyped for this movie for months and was disappointed that it initially did not get a North American release. I studied the very subject in my Soviet History class last year and was glad to see it with a few schoolmates today. I also bought the graphic novel as a sort of memento for the film; I read it on the trip home. 

Aesthetically, the film is brilliant. The choice to use no unnatural Russian accents makes the film absurd yet relatable at the same time, at least for English-speaking audiences. I really liked how the defiant pianist who actually used some kind of Slavic accent was portrayed by an actress who was actually born in the Soviet Union (I do not know if that is her natural speaking accent). The contrast between the grandeur of the Soviet elite and the common citizen in the location settings is portrayed well. The slow-mo introductions to each of the characters is also hilarious-my favorite of course, is Marshal Zhukov and his jiggling medals. Someone please make that into a .gif. 

My favorite part of the movie is the characterization. I went into the cinema knowing, or at least having an impression of, the basic traits of the major characters in the story: Khrushchev, the politician; Beria, the lecherous control freak; and Malenkov, the somewhat inept and deferential one. I was surprised to see just how much the portrayals of these people seemed to be almost right out of my history lessons.

The humour is top notch. There's too much good stuff from the movie to fit into a single paragraph here. Of course, it's also dark, as it should be. 

I read a few comments about how the third act seemed like an inappropriate tonal shift; I disagree somewhat. Admittedly it was indeed a shift from the black comedy found throughout the rest of the film, I don't think it was inappropriate given the nature of the subject matter we're dealing with here-it's important that we're reminded that these historical figures aren't exactly nice people. I do, however, think that the actual problem lies in the fact that the third act feels rushed. 

Compared to the graphic novel, I liked the movie far better; perhaps because the book seemed to me more like a tragic, dramatic graphic novel as opposed to an actual comedy. I've noted a couple of differences between the book and the film whose substitution, alteration, or removal were welcome. The sexual content is virtually gone, or made extremely subtle in the film. The rough, grim, gritty, and occasionally unpleasant nature of the original book becomes a more palatable, subtle, yet still bleakly comic farce in the movie.

This movie was absolutely worth waiting months for. The moment North America gets its home video release, I am going to buy it immediately!",833jvx
dw8txmq,This was by far the oldest crowd I have ever seen a movie with. Most of those in the theater were likely childhood friends of Stalin.,833jvx

dvf8u56,"Wow, has this only just come out in the US? Go see it if you're a fan of political satire, historical comedy, or Armando Iannucci in general. Some people complain about the tonal shifts but aside from the ending I didn't really sense any. The tone reminded me more of Inglourious Basterds than The Thick of It although it has the latter's farcical elements.   ",833jvx
dvoqbat,Much like Dr. Strangelove this movie could only have been made as a comedy. Only when it is already acknowledged that the subject and its  key figures are ridiculous can the true monstrosity of their actions be properly portrayed. ,833jvx

Each character is so fun and horrifying its impossible to forgive anyone (except Zhukov, he's lovely)

But really this is a fantastic cast ",833jvx
dvk036q,FUTURE CLASSIC,833jvx
dw5h48e,"I'm really glad Steve Buscemi was in this, and imo I think the movie was hilarious. But I think they got his character wrong. Kruschev was actually considered a bit of a country bumpkin. He had bad manners, ate and drank a lot, and talked everybody's ear off. Buscemi plays him as more intelligent, quiet and calculated. The real Kruschev had a larger than life personality. 

Still a great film though. I think maybe its not so much about historical accuracy, and more about how this ensemble of fictional characters tries to outsmart each other following Stalin's death. It exists entirely within this fictional comedy bubble. ",833jvx
dvllc56,"by seeing this movie, you have been banned from /r/latestagecapitalism",833jvx

Wonderful. Must watch. Sadly, that's pretty hard. I couldn't find a theatre within 50 miles of me. In fact I think I'd have to drive all the way to Atlanta to see it legally, in theaters.",833jvx
dvqnva5,"Saw it the other day with a friend at the IFC Center in Manhattan. People have mostly discussed the humor, and indeed if you find other Ianucci films funny, you will definitely like this one. However it also has a fair amount of horror, making sure the audience doesn't start sympathizing with Lavrentiy Beria.

Jason Isaacs and Steve Buscemi were perfect.

Though it's in many ways a small film that could be enjoyed at home, I encourage you to see it in a theater if you can. We had a good audience that recoiled from the horror and laughed at the jokes, which in my experience enhances a film.",833jvx
dw8emxa,"Just saw it. As someone with basically no knowledge of the actual historical events...I was confused. Which...could've been the point. Overall the humor was done really well and I liked the look of it. Honestly, as much as Beria was def a dirtbag...I still felt bad when they all ganged up on him. It actually was pretty disturbing to me, imaging what it would feel like losing total control of the situation and not being able to say/do anything to stop what was inevitable. Especially with no trial or anything. Grow a spine Georgy!",833jvx
dw9iwth,"I liked this movie, but didn't love it. What it does incredibly well is show that, no matter how overwhelming they may seem, political systems are just made up of people. And these people are often confused, spineless, backstabbing, out for their own agendas, and have a million other imperfect qualities. It demonstrates this through dark humor that only actually made me laugh a few times but was generally entertaining throughout. I think whether or not this movie is a hit for you will be largely based on your sense of humor.",833jvx
dvf9cxz,"There isn't that laugh out loud type of atmosphere but there's definitely a lot of sick irony in it, which I'm guessing is a strong element of dark comedy. That being said the only other dark comedy film I've seen (and loved) is Dr. Strangelove.

dvfbg4q,"Easily in my top 3 favourite films of 2017 (behind blade runner 2049 and Dunkirk). I think this far funnier and darker than Innanuci's work on Veep or In The Loop. Really interesting film on a period of history we don't often know about and has a joke a minute. Some make you smile and some are laugh out loud but all are extremely quotable especially Jason Isaacs. The sheer madness and ridiculousness of this period Russian history makes it easy to understand why Innanuci's chose it, I found the tone to be spot on but if you don't like dark humour this won't be your cup of tea.

Also  interesting fact in real life the orchestra at the start had to get a second replacement conductor because the first replacement was too drunk to play when summoned! ",833jvx

Tambor and Buscemi great. ",833jvx
dw58c3y,"I thought this film was brilliant. The Russian politics were played by Americans and British with no attempt to hide accents and it was all a metaphor for the chaotic, American political system. 

The movie itself is a joke, as the plot becomes more convoluted and we as the audience don’t completely comprehend what’s happening nor are we intended to but we still have our judgements of these characters. Just like our culture that does not always understand what goes on in our government yet we will always have a judgement of our leaders.",833jvx
dxff9d2,"Watched **The death of Stalin** this weekend, got to say it's a fantastic movie, one of the best black comedies (really really black) I've watched, and the use of Satire is amazing, reminded me a Little of Chaplin's The great dictator. There were some moments I couldn't stop laughing, like Malenkov's ""*When I said 'No problem', what I meant was no...problem*"", all the delivery was amazing and it was weird to laugh at usually tense moments. The physical comedy is also great.

But also, the movie delivers the political situation with Stalin and the lists so perfectly, there were moments the film turned into something horrifying, a reflection of all the ugly things that were happening in Russia at the moment. This balance between raw reality and comedy, made the movie perfect, along with the cast. For me, all of them were amazing and can't pick just one; the decision to not attempt Russian accents made the movie even better. Would totally recommend. ",833jvx

dvfl3in,"My 7.5/10 review:

Iannucci’s farcical take on historical events turns the issues of Stalin’s succession into a comedic putsch. It underscores the absurdity of Soviet devotion to their leader when juxtaposed against the conniving hypocrisy of the remaining ministers. It’s an unsually funny movie about the death of a murderous dictator that brought on more death in its wake, and in fact it could be seen as tactless or even disrespectful, except it’s just too good and too hilarious to complain about. Steve Buscemi is a neurotic riot, Jeffrey Tambor shines as a rather daft figure, and Simon Russell Baele is imposingly malicious as the head of the secretive state police. The writing is razor sharp and the humor ranges from political satire all the way to slapstick, making almost every scene funny in a new and different way. However, the film’s events turn dark towards the end and the emotionless execution of people at point-blank range hardly fits the light tone of the rest of the movie. It is especially a film to be enjoyed for the writing and performances.",833jvx
dvexpj2,"This is going to sound bad, but this movie felt a lot like an ""off-brand"" Coen Brothers film, this shouldn't be seen has a negative though, it was still very much its own thing, the humor was way darker than anything done by the Coen's for example, but it still had that surreal feeling or ""tilted reality"" that most of their movies have.

I really enjoyed it, it's not extraordinary but it an interesting dark (emphasis on dark) comedy, it was pretty short (107 minutes) but I guess that helped not overstay it's welcome.",833jvx
dvldcik,"It alright, i guess. I didn't think the VEEP-style humor worked as well as it should have when the cast is Soviet leaders. I barely knew who anyone was. Maybe it would be funnier to Eastern Europeans?  

But the film did give me an idea. What if there was a VEEP-style film about the Founding Fathers? They're practically deified; they need a dressing down as flawed individuals, and the director of VEEP has the right level of absurdity to spin it. ",833jvx
dvf9vgk,"I thoroughly enjoyed it but the accents really did detract from it after the first couple minutes. I mean I get the joke and it was funny but it's just so in your face it grew tiresome after a while. Felt like intentionally bad Russian accents would have worked as a better joke for this sort of movie. Solid comedy though, no other serious complaints to be had.",833jvx

And when Malenkov (Jeff Tambor) is approached by Beria and he starts the conversation with ""Oh If you could do me a favour and nod as I'm speaking, people are looking at me for reassurance and I have no idea what's going on"" it cracked me up. He's such a hilarious and pathetic character. 

I cannot recommend this movie enough, I've already watched it two times.  

The most funny scene was when they sat on a table to vote in favour of pausing the arrest and executions and Molotov makes them raise and low their hands 3 times with his speech. It was brilliant!",833jvx

The movie was fantastic -- one of those things where once you start quoting you don't want to stop.

Yeah, I really liked that in the middle of the film it started painting Khrushchev in a positive light as if it was going down the route of ""Khrushchev wasn't too bad, and brought about sweeping positive reforms for Russla, and the USSR lived happily ever after"". Then Beria just starts laying down all of the horrific things the council members had done in the ""all of you"" scene, and you realise that on a practical level they're all just as gruesome as one another. ",833jvx
dvffwdo,"One of my favourite moments is the very end, during the text crawl where it states what happened to the characters, and reveals that a lot of the major players were removed, and that Khrushchev doesn't even end up being in charge for all that long with a slide over to Brezhnev. Reminds us that this is not the end of the backstabbing in the USSR government, and these people really don't change all that much.",833jvx

It basically condensed months-long events into a couple of days. ",833jvx
dvfedkz,"I absolutely agree about the accents, though I totally didn't expect to.

It actually gave the whole thing the ring and feel of a sort of British genre comedy, like a Guy Ritchie crime caper sort of thing. I virtually got deja vu from the bit where Stalin pops out and says ""what took you so long, you fucking walk here?"", and for a split second forgot I wasn't watching one of my old favourites like *Layer Cake*, *Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels*, or *Snatch*.

dvvsmq8,"That is actually Yezhov, Beria took his job and executed him.  He was head of the NKVD for a few years.

Stalin needed a scapegoat at the time, and Yezhov was maybe seen as somewhat of a threat.  So he got executed and made into a political un-person.  Not that you should feel bad for him, Yezhov was one of the scummiest human beings ever to live and he personally murdered thousands.",833jvx

The range of regional accents also works given the vast size of the Soviet Union and the diverse backgrounds of the leadership. Beria and Stalin were both Georgians, Khrushchev was from a peasant village on the Russian-Ukrainian border and grew up partly in Ukraine, Mikoyan was Armenian, Malenkov's hometown of Orenburg is on the Europe-Asia border near present-day Kazakhstan.

The Death of Stalin is much cheaper, has no complexity, and even the great actors are playing stick figurines with no depth. It's like paint-by-numbers caricatures of caricatures.

It's a bit deeper than that in my opinion, in that in the UK there is such an ingrained perception of people from any given region that as a filmmaker, all you need to do to convey 80% of what a  character is like to a British audience is give them a certain accent. Filmmakers have been doing this to more or less great effect for decades (see, any film set in ancient Rome), but in a comedy like the Death of Stalin, you can play it up even more.

A random Brit who's never even heard of Georgy Zhukov would have immediately known what kind of person he [is supposed to be] simply by the fact they've given him a Yorkshire accent. Similarly, having Stalin have a Cockney accent immediately puts him apart in class and temperament from his subordinates who are all played by Americans or middle class-English - which tallies with his real life background, too.",833jvx

As someone interested in the history of the People's Republic of China, I'd like to see a The Crown type drama about Zhou Enlai, Mao's second-in-command, who had a biography written about him called Zhou Enlai: The Last Revolutionary. It could be a great story, detailing his time as a young man in Paris and Berlin where he joined the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, his role in the united front between the CCP and the KMT, the civil war that followed, his crucial role as China's top diplomat (securing international relations throughout the Third World and later arranging Nixon's visit to China). He was frequently purged over his career as he had Mao's had a contentious relationship.

It got an Italian-Briton to make a tv series ridiculing its government (Veep by this same man who made The Death of Stalin) and during the height of the Reagan era, made Missing and financed Oliver Stone films. This is a Fox [tv show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFV1uT-ihDo&t=40s) for Christ's sake. Oh and The Death of Stalin is a European production made based on a French comic.

dvocei0,I think it works.  People who aren't Russian can't really differentiate between the regional accents and stereotypes that Russia has - and they're vaster than even the US.  Kruschev would probably best be portrayed as having a US southern backcountry accent.  He was a crude and vulgar Ukranian ('nekulterny' to Russians) peasant. ,833jvx

dvocbt9,"Thing is though, Stalin was Georgian.  He was sort of the 'diversity hire' among a cabinet that was overwhelmingly male Great Russians. For a while his official position was to be the HR director in charge of diversity affairs, although they used Soviet terms to describe it instead of early 21st century politicalbabble.   So I dunno in the Brit context - he'd be what, the Polish plumber?

At least in the US, British accents are kind of universally and instinctively perceived as sophisticated, so he's set apart by his lack of ""sophistication"" in speech, essentially.

Invasion of Iraq: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq

Raqqa and Mosul weren't destroyed by Russia. Raqqa was captured by the American backed SDF which has no air force, defended by ISIS which has no air force and yet flattened by bombs dropped from the air. Mosul was taken by the US backed Iraqi Army who they trained and equipped and gave a limited air force, while the coalition also helped to flatten the city a bunch as well. So who exactly do you think destroyed these cities, martians?
