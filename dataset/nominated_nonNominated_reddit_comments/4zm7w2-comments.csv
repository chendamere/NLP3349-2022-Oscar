d6x16hf,"This summers been all about disappointing blockbusters, remakes, and reboots. Nice to see a movie that is well written, has actual character development, and is patient and nuanced. Probably the best thing that Chris Pine has ever done, and I quite like him in the first Star Trek,

 It's my favorite of the year so far. I'm probably going to go again soon. Couldn't recommend it more",4zm7w2
d6wzk7q,"My two favourite scenes/moments:
- Chris Pine visibly nervous, trying to keep his composure as the cop checks his license at the road block.
- When Chris essentially challenges Jeff Bridges to a duel on the porch, Jeff subtly inches his fingers toward his gun before the truck with the ex-wife and kids pulls into the driveway.
Just excellent, small details in their acting that drew me into the story better than any movie I've seen in theater this year.",4zm7w2
d6wzrwc,"Did anyone else get the idea that the blonde brother was a veteran? It started with the first scene with the graffiti about veterans troubles, made me think that the director wanted us to think about that. When I saw how he taped his clips together I thought ""that seems like an army trick"". And when he took out his sniper rifle and started making great shots, it kind of clicked for me. ",4zm7w2
d6xszjt,"Most of what I liked about this film has already been posted. One thing I haven't seen mentioned: NO LOVE INTEREST. I was dreading it first when the waitress was all flirty, then when the girl approached him in the casino, then with his ex wife, but nope. It made the relationship with his brother all the more powerful, and it was enough that he was going through all this to break the cycle of poverty with his kids.",4zm7w2
d6x42p1,"My favorite part of this movie is how utterly absorbed -everyone- in the theater was.  When Alberto was sniped near the end, almost everyone there let out a collective gasp.

That, and Jeff Bridges as a cowboy.",4zm7w2
d6x63yb,"I think this film was a perfect example of translating the Western into the modern world. People are trying to hold on to the way things used to be, but you can't outrun the trains of ""progress.""

I guess Chris Pine's character ""won"" in the end, but at a terrible cost...and regardless of what he did, he can't stop the change. His kids aren't going to work the ranch, and the banks will keep taking advantage of the locals. 

I'm not really sure there's a ""Bolivia"" left in the world to hide, even for a time. 

Great, great film. Great story, great writing, great performances. Head and shoulders above anything else I've seen this year. ",4zm7w2
d6x5cyn,"Does a movie like this with such strong brother relationships resonate strongly with any one else?  We don't see any flashback, just an old photo of the two of them, but the dialogue is so descriptive that we can make out what their lives had been before.  


The second casino bar scene really got to me as a person with a sibling, as in the first we see Tobye just patiently waiting to cash out, anxious for the next job, before he interacts with another women.  However he is ""saved"" by his brother and you see how the two of them are different but there for one another.  And then when Toby hears the news of the shootout on the Tv and it just fades out and we see him curl up around the chips and put his brother's hat on and just cries.  Man that was such an emotional scene fore me and I think every actor and actress in the movie really gave amazing performances.  I think that the actors show the characters pain and different issues so realistically, and the writing is still so dramatic and captivating.

Ben Foster as Tanner was so calculated.  His brother reminds him to ""slow down"" but the reply is ""I'm not speeding"" just foreshadows how ruthless and and prepared the older brother is.  He killed their abusive father,putting an end to the dangerous situation.   He doesn't hesitate to kill two armed civilians to protect Toby.  He is constantly lugging around ""his livelihood"" much to Toby's protest but when it looks as if they are going to be run down by the militia, Tanner effectively and efficiently disarms the situation he saw coming.  I don't remember exactly what his last lines went, [I am the master of the plains, this is who I am].  Which mirrored the Native American encounter earlier in the bar, is then brought full circle.  When Jeff Bridges character, winded and tired, claims the kill to avenge his fallen partner.  

Man I loved this movie, I felt so lucky to watch it the in morning, very empty theater, the only downside was that the screen was flickering the whole time, distracting from the brightness and what was happening on screen.  I'm curious as to what other people thought about the cinematography and if I should see it again in a better theater.

d6xqktp,"I can't give this film enough praise, my favorite scene was the exchange between Tanner and the Comanche in the casino.

""Comanche means enemy of everyone.""

""You know what that makes me then?""

""An enemy.""

""A comanche.""

And then it's called back on the ridge, ""Lord of the plains.""

Taylor Sheridan is really knocking it out of the park, I hope his next film continues the trend",4zm7w2
d6xxc2q,"Absolutely **love** how this movie used violence through its later half. As you're watching the initial robberies, due to the lack of (extreme) physical harm, you start to think, ""ohhh they're harmless, nothing *too* bad is really going to happen..."", but during the final robbery when they shoot and kill? Completely shocked! Caught me with a bat right across the head and reminded me that these are dangerous situations and that no, you can't just rob a bank with zero consequence.",4zm7w2

d6x3voo,"This film was absolutely fantastic. Most of the positive comments cover what I loved about it.

d6wyxem,"In a movie filled with memorable moments, the most amazing to me was Jeff Bridges' ten-second bit of acting after his character shoots Tanner (Ben Foster). Going from temporary joy at getting revenge on the man who killed his partner, to horrified sadness at the thought that he did, indeed, just kill someone. A perfect summary of the complicated morals of the film, all conveyed through Bridges' performance.

Brilliant film.",4zm7w2
d6wzraj,"Great movie.  Great performances by everyone.  I love a Nick Cave and Warren Ellis composed score.  Always pleasing.

And again, I don't know how the hell Hollywood has done Ben Foster so wrong.  The dude deserves more roles.  He acts circles around his peers.

Only complaint: They didn't need to beat you over the head with the bank message.  I would have got the message well enough with the plot, and maybe one or two trips down a highway littered with 'For Sale' and 'Debt Management' signs.  And, again, you know, the plot.  They were a little heavy-handed with driving that point home.

But still, enjoyed the movie very much.  Girlfriend is listening to the soundtrack as she cooks supper this very moment.",4zm7w2
d6x5uv8,"That last bank sequence was amazing. So fucking tense. I loved the way Ben Foster ordered the bank tellers to take out the money in unison like a drill sergeant. And then when they're trying to escape, more civilians are shooting at them outside. 

Moral of the story: Don't rob banks in Texas",4zm7w2
d6yh8qg,"While neither the themes (the financial crisis) or the films that really clearly inspired *Hell or High Water* (*No Country For Old Men, Dog Day Afternoon*) are subtle, they don't have to be.

When you lead with graffiti that bemoans the economic downturn from the perspective of someone who did three tours in Iraq, an older woman in a threadbare dress smoking her last cigarette before opening a small town bank, and a 1988-1992 era Camaro ZR2 in present day--you know this is a poor area. And you feel it. The desolation permeates every single frame.

Nearly every scene is filled with the poor, people living from paycheck to paycheck, people who have settled into their lives and don't want to change. Even the bank management, who are by and large the villains of this film, are clearly in a situation where they know they can't get ahead and will take any measure to defend what scraps they can get.

So when you get levity in Jeff Bridges' near-retirement Texas Ranger and his partner played by Journeyman B-Movie Needs A Native American actor Gil Birmingham, or the few spots of brotherly infighting and fun between the bank robbing duo of Chris Pine and Ben Foster... It's well appreciated.

Then again, both of these pairs find their own strains, their own failures, and their own parallels as the plot moves forward.

And all of these things tell one story.

Everyone in this movie had something taken from them. Everyone loses a major piece of themselves. And that's just what happens, sometimes.

Here's to the first Obvious Frontrunner for the Oscars.",4zm7w2

d6x027e,"Fantastic film, my favorite of 2016 so far.  Bridges and Foster were fantastic and I'm guessing both will receive award consideration.  Pine was also good, just not as good as the other two.  I was also surprised at the amount of humorous moments in the film.  The plot felt real and like something that could actually be pulled off given a bit of luck.   The characters, their motivations, and their responses to the situations all felt authentic and not unrealistic.  

9.5/10",4zm7w2
da19pz6,"I'm probably alone on this, but at the end when Jeff Bridges is walking towards the car, the car should transform into a robot, Jeff should hop on it's back and then they both fly up into the sky in power stance. The credits can roll over the top as they fly through outer space. Awesome movie, this would be my only improvement.

Anyone craving some more should check out 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot' (1974), another western bank heist movie starring Bridges and Clint Eastwood. It's aged almost as well as Jeff!",4zm7w2
d7o70wc,"Help me understand... SPOILERS

The brothers knew there was oil at the ranch, and that it could earn them $50k pm... So why couldn't they get a bank loan against that projected earning? 

Sure, the point is we can't trust the banks/they're cunts, but robbing banks seems pretty reckless to me. Shit, I'd rather use a loan shark and give away a big chunk of said earnings... Or why not try and raise private funding? The oil offers a guaranteed income! 

Part of me wishes the oil was just or theory they had, or that they discovered it AFTER paying off the bank... So they risked everything to keep the ranch on principle, when in reality they were sat on a goldmine all along. Seems more poetic. 

Just a thought.",4zm7w2

""the things we do for our children.""  This is one of those films that will stick with me because of everything my father has done for my family given recent divorce issues and my mother being after money.  This is going to be one of those movies on my shelf that my kids will always wonder why it's there,  and they will never really know what it means to me personally and everything my father has been through and is still there for me and my family.

He's well aware that he's a loose cannon, that he can easily fuck this thing up, as he demonstrates time and time again, but Pine is put in this dilemma that inevitably results in an outcome that's simultaneously poignant and tragic. Poignant because Pine's intentions for the robbery are in a good place, while at the same time it got to the point that he could see coming, losing a man of his own blood for good. It really is a dense outcome, and will be just as troubling to him as Bridges' character says, if not more so. I loved this film.",4zm7w2

I really appreciated the final verbal showdown between Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges characters. A lesser movie may not have been able to pull off this denouement, but this one does. The scene is thick with tension, and you feel for both characters, not wanting either to lose more than they already have.

But you know it's already too late. This was never going to end well.",4zm7w2

d707wsl,"Really, really dug this movie. After all the trash I've sat through this summer, this was a relief. It's like a bank robbery Sicario with No Country for Old Men weaved in. This Taylor Sheridan guy is seeming to be the real deal. Gives me hope for Sicario sequels without Denis Villanueve or Roger Deakins. 

Plot was simple, but the characters brought it alive. Casting was spot-on. Jeff Bridges could play this character in his sleep, but he gives it life. The dynamic between he and his partner were excellent.

The movie lives or dies on the brothers, though and they nail it. Chris Pine giving the performance of his career in my opinion. Doesn't coast on his charm and good looks, his performance is subtle and fascinating. Ben Foster always gives it 110% but here his talents aren't wasted in bad movie and hopefully this leads to more Ben Mendelsohn-type supporting character roles for Foster going forward.

Loved how a lot of the shots in the film seemed like portraits, too. Absolutely beautiful.

If the land was that valuable with oil, wouldn't he have a legal duty to pay it off so it could go to the grand kids' trust?  Why was any bank robbing necessary?",4zm7w2
d8p4aek,"How much money would they have if they'd have just sold the cars, guns, and backhoe they used in the film for their plan? Those cars, even if they're beaters, drive reliably and must be worth a few thousand each for parts, especially the Cadillac(?) that they end up with. The backhoe rental must have put them back as well. The automatic rifle, hunting rifle, and 2 pistols could be sold. I kept thinking that they're destroying close to $44,000 of their own property to MAYBE get enough in small bills from the banks to make it back. What if they hit all the banks and came up slightly short?

 Assuming that the debt became known only after the mother died, that gives 2 brothers a few months to try to get the rest of the money.

Even though it was filmed in NM, this movie not only gets the look down, but the people of the area as well. I absolutely loved how even though everyone is ""small town folk"" type, no one is presented as being dumb. Every small character in this movie has layers (props to writer Taylor Sheridan).

d7kwrki,"I've just been to see this for the second time in 3 days, it's that good. For me, it's one of the best films this year, by a country mile. And Pine's performance is worthy of a nomination, at least. The direction, script, cinematography, performances (all of them), and soundtrack just come together to tell a story you both care about and get immersed in right up to the end of the film.

This film does what all films should do -- it tells a story you grow to care about. By that I mean in a way which engages you, makes you think, and makes you care about the characters; even the waitresses!

The morality doesn't hit you over the head, nor does it taste sickly sweet. There's social commentary here, but it's not preachy or unfairly judgemental. It's a tale that gets honest performances from all involved. And the reason I'm a little gushy here is because I initially went in cold, and yet was actually super satisfied when I came out both times! 

I want films to mesmerise me. It's a shame that this summer (at my local multiplex) has been so grim, with 'blockbuster' after 'blockbuster'. Sure, there are still some good 'blockbuster' films (2016 Jungle Book was really good), but it's too samey too often.

d79amaz,"Loved the film. Felt like the running theme was ""what do you do when you have nothing to lose."" Each character is dealing with the problem with different situation and consequences. Toby has no money and nothing to provide for his children, no home soon, but cares for them deeply. Tanner's life is so messed up that he has nothing but his brother. The scene where he sees his mother's deathbed and says ""fuck her"" juxtaposed his ""I love you Toby"" in the end. I feel like Tanner knew he was never going to get out of this week alive and acted accordingly, trying to balance helping his brother and having some fun for himself. Marcus is on his last hurrah and has nothing to look forward to after. He is searching for connection and purpose. His job gives hi purpose but that is being taken away. His one and only connection in the film is taken away from him and is left alone again, especially that scene where he shoots Tanner is some of the best acting I've seen. In the final scene, it seems the roles have reversed for Toby and Marcus. Toby has gotten what he wants and now has something to fight for and Marcus has nothing anymore, making him the more dangerous one. While watching it I couldn't tell if they would kill each other or somehow become friends in a weird way. I can imagine going forward that Marcus would keep Toby alive, only to have that possibility always there of killing him, cause its one of his only connections and as much as he hates him, doesn't want to lose him.

Even if debt relief companies charged DOUBLE to lend the money to avoid foreclosure -- the debt relief company would be assured of getting paid back, from the oil revenue.

Also, foreclosure takes months, so why were they forced into a situation where they had to rob banks immediately.  If they had oil on the ranch, why couldn't they have gotten more time for debt relief, since the future oil revenue would be sure collateral on any loan, no matter how usurious the interest rate (or even go to a loan shark (although that's what debt relief companies really are)...

2> After Tanner was killed, shouldn't the police research immediately uncovered that they were facing a foreclosure deadline -- and that's why they needed the money?

So, after Tanner was killed, Toby should have been the immediate suspect (like Hamilton suspected).  So why was the female police detective so adamant about Toby not being a suspect -- only because he had no police record, and no reason to take the money (because of the future oil revenue) -- when, in fact, the police could have known quickly that a foreclosure was averted at the last minute --

3> When Hamilton came to visit Toby in the last scene, Hamilton told Toby that he (Hamilton) was tresspassing, and that Toby would be in his rights to shoot him.  Why didn't Toby shoot him and say he was being harrassed by Hamilton for no reason -- thus ending any further blackmail attempts by Hamilton.

The way it ended, Hamilton could blackmail Toby anytime in the future.

4> Why didn't Toby at least require that Hamilton drop any weapon (although it looked like Hamilton didn't have a gun on his belt) -- or at least frisk Hamilton at gunpoint.  Or (as mentioned) just shoot him dead and say he thought it was a tresspasser.

5> When Hamilton confiscated the waitress' $200 tip -- to use as evidence: why didnt he tell her that the money would be returned after a trial?  If someone robs a bank and buys  a lot of stuff at Walmart for instance (or a car, or whatever) -- is a third party required to give back any stolen money, and take a loss, if they had nothing to do with a robbery?",4zm7w2
d7mff01,"I knew literally nothing about this movie when I went to go see it. I thought it was going to be set in classic spaghetti western cowboy times, then I saw the car in the opening scene and though oh it must be set in the 70s or something it has that haze about it. Then I saw the cop vape in Jeff Bridges office and I realized the setting was in the present. That's what I liked best the movie is very good at indirectly giving you clear details that set the scene. ",4zm7w2

d6yf04a,"This was a fantastic movie, simple yet very powerful story and moral message.

Excellent script with excellent dialogue, great and natural chemistry between the characters, Simple yet very competent cinematography and editing that served it's purpose of thematic and tonal comparison and juxtaposition.

Slight nitpicks: Some of the world building felt a bit caricatured
and there was one moment involving a character's monologue that had the central theme being a bit too on the nose, it didn't take me out of the movie but my brain noticed it.

Chris Pine was surprisingly good in this, most of the time I wasn't thinking of him as the actor Chris Pine and that's with the recent Star Trek Beyond being out

Jeff Bridges was great in this as well, although he fell into being a caricatured as I mentioned earlier,but his character arc was great granted it was bit cliche'd

d6znluo,Just saw Hell or High Water today and thought it was fantastic--probably the best movie I've seen in 2016 with green Room being a close second. I thought the commentary drawing comparisons between manifest destiny and current predatory lending practices was interesting and the poetic justice of a man stealing from a lender to pay said lender was cathartic. The performances were excellent and the script was fantastic; Hell or High Water is also the funniest movie I've seen all year. This is a real must see. Throw your dollars toward this and let's hope we see more movies like this as opposed to more bloated reboots and toothless super hero flicks.,4zm7w2
d7esbv8,"This movie was very very good. However, in my opinion it has a major flaw or two. They didn't need to rob banks to pay off the ~$40,000. Even if we assume that everything happened all at once (the mom died, they found oil the same day, and the money was due in just a few days.....which I would argue is unlikely) they still could have gone to a private investor for a loan, hell even another bank. They could've probably negotiated with PayDay loans or any number of institutions. Since they're expecting $50,000/month of income, it would've been easy to secure a loan with their proof of accounts receivable plenty of time to spare. And they make Chris Pine out to be a very intelligent man (even clever enough to file his son's trust with the very same bank he owed money to so that the bank would be less cooperative with authorities). If Chris Pine's character is as smart as they make him out to be (the mastermind of the robberies, he definitely would've thought of that. And I don't even think it's fair to argue that even if they thought of that, that they still wanted to stick it to the bank for trying to ""rob"" them of their family's farm. Ben Foster's character--yes-- I could see him wanting to stick it to the bank, but not Chris Pine's character. There's a scene at the end where he tells Ben that he loves him, and I'd argue that Chris is too level headed and wouldn't put anyone he loved in a situation like that unless it was absolutely necessary. So this made me like the movie a little less. Chris is either smart or he isn't. Clearly he is. So he would've known to get a second financier, not a gun to rob banks.

One other problem is that during the last bank robbery, Chris Pine's character is shot, and would've definitely left behind blood at the crime scene. They could have compared the blood found at the crime scene to Ben Foster's character's blood. Simple DNA testing would quickly prove that the blood found at the scene of the crime would be a sibling of Ben Foster's character. (Siblings have extremely similar DNA). Then they could've gotten a warrant to check Chris Pine's characters blood to prove he was the other robber, and then he'd be in jail. The only way around this would be that it was sort of hard to see exactly when Chris Pine's character was shot (so maybe...maybe... he was shot in the truck, which was later lit on fire). So maybe there's no blood at the crime scene, but I think that's a stretch. So this is super nitpicky, and I will say I loved the movie. I just hate the fact that there's some big errors.",4zm7w2
d7nilet,"Sorry I'm late to this, I just saw the movie last night! It's so fantastic! 
The moment when they go into the bigger bank and they (and the audience) see's the amount of people in the bank was brilliant. Everything after that moment was perfect in it's suspense and tragedy.

I loved the scene where the brothers say goodbye to each other. The camera stays on them for so long, and you see so much in that scene.
The way the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" in this movie are just so morally ambiguous and both likeable and dislikeable really took this movie up a notch. Not to mention the acting. ",4zm7w2

d6xy562,"It's my second favorite movie of the year so far, and liking a thriller more than Green Room was something I was not expecting. The characters were extremely well-written, in my opinion. Rarely did the film say instead of show. I thought the monologue about being poor being a disease was wonderful and really gave great insight into Toby. Bridges did a fantastic job, especially from the second Alberto was shot. The panic in his face, the realization about the danger they were in, and how he took it upon himself to kill Tanner. Then, when he killed Tanner, he breaks down after seeing his friend die. IMO, this film deserves a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the Academy.

I thought it was cool that the actor who played Alberto is Comanche too. Good for Natives to get roles playing their specific tribe in a modern world.",4zm7w2

d6xmlk1,"Really loved the movie. Saw it about a week ago but the comments here have been reminding me of all the great scenes (I completely forgot the ""what don't you want"" scene! My theatre was dying).

Great performances all around but Ben Foster stole the show. ""That makes me a Comanche."" is the line of the year in my book. Bridges killed it as usual, I kept thinking if he and Tom Hanks made a movie together they would be the most likable duo in movie history.

I would say my only issue with the movie is that at a certain point it became very easy to telegraph. I felt somewhere around the middle I had a pretty good idea about who was going to live, who was going to die, and who was going to get away with it. It's a very well executed, well written movie, it just wasn't as tense as it could have been because it just couldn't surprise me.

It was interesting because I also kept feeling like this was a very familiar kind of movie. It had a feel to it like if it were a John Wayne and James Dean movie that came out in the 50s, I wouldn't bat an eye. I don't know what that means for the quality of the movie, but I think it's a positive. It's timeless, in a way.

I'd give it a solid 8/10 and happily see it again.",4zm7w2

When the brothers part ways in different directions, what was Tanner's (Ben Foster) motivation in going on his own? Was it to lead the pursuers and police away on what was essentially a suicide mission, so Toby would have a better chance of making it out? Or, did Tanner decide on a whim that he wanted to go his own way? I felt the scene left this ambiguous, because it seemed clear that the plan was for them to switch cars together. Their goodbye seemed to imply they both knew they would never see each other again. I may have missed a telling line of dialogue that would've cleared it up..

Like, everything looks right, the locations are spot-on, the cinematography is mostly great, but the performances just seemed so fucking inauthentic to me. I knew I was in trouble with Jeff Bridges first line is ""I loooove West Texas"". My eyes rolled back around in my skull. Kenny Powers' wife seemed miscast. Ben Foster was lackluster in my opinion. Chris Pine was really great. Bridges sounded like he left his teeth in his trailer for half the movie. The CGI pump jacks in the final scene were laughably bad (hence my ""mostly"" qualifier about cinematography). And their math for royalties from said pumpjacks is crazy high. I left wondering ""Is this how people from Fargo feel about the movie Fargo?"" Like yeah, the people in WT are definitely a different breed from your regular Texan, but what was on the screen didn't reflect my life or interactions with most of the small town West Texas folks I know & love. Lots of pandering to the people who wish they could be of West Texan stock (and yes, that's a thing here in Texas), but ultimately the whole thing felt pretty amateurish.

By the time we see the frail middle-aged bank teller open the door to her branch on a deserted Texas small town street, director David McKenzie has already established tension, and our expectations. He opens his 2016 neo-western Hell or High Water with a 90 second-ish long-take. A sketchy looking blue sedan revealed by the revolving and weaving camera comes into play, serving as the getaway vehicle for two masked men who rob the branch. These are our main protagonists: Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his brother Tanner (Ben Foster). Here we aren’t given any reason to see them as anything other than everyday bank robbers. But the charisma of these two leads make it hard to not want to root for them. As they rob more branches of the same bank, we find that they plan to use the money to pay back the mortgages on their family property, which they owe to the very same bank they’ve robbed. The scheme is clever, ironic, appropriate, timely, and given Toby’s intent to leave the property to his kids and estranged wife, it’s selfless. It’s also revealed completely organically. Instead of being treated as a twist, it’s just something that these two characters would have no need to reiterate at any time.

Despite the inherent likability of the two bandits, their adversary, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges), is almost as much of an a protagonist. Though some might find that the character’s glib comedy and idiosyncratic richness don’t make up for his vaguely tongue-in-cheek racism, Hamilton doesn’t prevent much of an obstacle for the Howard brothers, as he spends most of the film playing catch-up. He even has his own arc to deal with, which ultimately is given almost as much weight as that of the Howard brothers. The job Bridges has to do here as an aging cop close to retirement, itching for one last rodeo before he rides off into the sunset, is more than a little derivative, but his physicality and complete commitment to the quirks of his character helps to sell lines and behavior that might not seem credible on paper.

Since Ranger Hamilton and the Howards don’t meet until the last act of the film, most of the time is spent very definitively with one side or the other. Impressively, the film never significantly dips in momentum, as these two sides are weaved together and each is itself deftly executed. The climactic encounter of the two sides also does not disappoint, combining plausibility with surprisingly explosive action, and thoroughly effective character moments and revelations.

Though the plotting of the script (by Sicario‘s Taylor Sheridan) is very precise and clever, some of the dialogue and subtext comes dangerously close to on-the-nose, particularly when it’s made very clear that it’s like, the banks that are the real bad guys, man. Luckily, the performances have more than enough gravitas to make some oddly declarative philosophical statements feel natural, and McKenzie’s commitment to making everything seem organic actually keeps it all from falling into heavy-handedness.",4zm7w2

Also I love Ben Foster but he seemed more subdued than the other modern Westerns I've seen him in (3:10 To Yuma, Ain't Them Bodies Saints) and unlike those he didn't steal the show.

The scene where they are essentially saying goodbye, but he says, ""go fuck yourself,"" was powerful. He is giving up his life for his brother and says, ""I love you"" in the only way he knows how. It redeemed the character on the one level (their own relationship), but makes him a total shit bag on another (killing for fun).

Clever line, but completely false. 

What, they're both Texas lawmen? Because other than that obvious connection, they are so completely different. Bridges' Ranger is full of energy and brio while Jones' sheriff glumly goes about his job with just a few moments of very dry humor.

d7n7ka9,"There's no depth in Ben Foster's character? I don't agree with this. He's not simply a nut, he's a thrill seeker who loves crime and violence for the sake of it. He sees himself as a defiant warrior. This is particularly interesting in the context with the relationship with his brother: his help in robbing and his ""sacrifice"" both come from a mix of love and thrill-seeking. I'd say most of the characters have plenty of depth, similarly, except for Alberto.

I mean, you say the characters lack depth, but the only parts you cared about were the parts where they were robbing banks or having shootouts. The part where ""nothing happens"" were where the movie was developing the characters and their relationships, though the restaurant scene was mostly just for humor.

There's very little ambiguous about the ending. For the motive, the sheriff is bored and feels like the case hasn't been properly closed, so he goes to talk to the criminal he couldn't catch. Both because he genuinely wants to know his motives and also because he wants to go out in a duel with the criminal. He hints at this desire earlier in the film and also talks about maybe preferring to die in a fight with a criminal rather than live out his boring retirement. The conflict and tension between them is left unresolved for the time being, but the ending makes perfect sense.

Complete with snarky sassy deputy a la No Country. Though the snarky sassy sidekick is be no means a novel trope. It just depends on how well the movies use these tropes -- and H/HW doesn't use them well.

Oh, and Bridges' retirement? Nix that, because he decides to go after Chris Pine for no reason. He's bored, I guess? Or he wants revenge for the deputy he already got revenge for? So his logical response is ""let me get in a shootout and if I kill him I look like a jackass and if I die I look like a jackass.""

And throughout the rest of the movie we're constantly reminded of these little towns dying and their way of life disappearing. The people of the area fight tooth and nail for every dollar, just look at the diner waitress.

d6xcjyc,"I must agree that they definitely nailed the look/feel of small town WT. it definitely helps that they shot on location. I had problems with the characterization of the locals from almost the first time we meet one, when Bridges' character arrives at the first bank. The guy says something about ""finding them first"" or such, then Bridges is like ""LOL I lurrrrve West Texas."" It continued from there, like protagonists kept running in to kooky locals just so the movie could be like ""Can you believe these salt-of-the-earth people?!"" 

The second ornery waitress that talks with the Rangers, while funny, was a bit of a digression just so the writers could, again, belabor the point that West Texans are just like ""rattlesnakes,"" ready to bite. In my experience, people from our area are some of the nicest folks in the state, if not country. The good ol' boys at the nearby table (at the earlier diner) bothered me too, because they too seemed like they would be of a type that would want to help a Texas Ranger, but even they feign ignorance about the brothers. Everyone the Rangers seemed to encounter were a bit prickish, when most people in that area would trip over themselves to aid a LEO (maybe not a fed, but a local LEO) catch a bank robber. Also, the fellow who remarks about field dressing the boys and putting them on the hood of the truck was another example of off-putting characterization. Bridges' constant racism against his ""Injun"" (his word, not mine) partner was a little much, but sadly that part isn't wildly unrealistic, mainly because you got a real sense that he cared for the partner more than his offensive words let on.

And you said aside from the guns, but I can't let it go unmentioned that the ""posse"" they encounter just outside the last bank is completely unfeasible, as is their unrelenting pursuit of a suspect that just fired on them with an assault rifle. Where did that posse come from on such short notice? Are we to say ""LOL, West Texas, of course there's an armed posse ready to go at the literal drop of a hat?"" We love our guns, but even the most ardent gun owner would probably have handled that situation in a million different, better, ways. 

Ultimately it just boils down to the fact that it's a bunch of Hollywood actors trying to nail the mannerisms and language of a group I've lived among my whole life, and it just rang hollow for me. I now live in Houston, and the theater I was at ate every frame of that movie up. There's a lot of great shit in that movie, like the final scene of Bridges/Pine (save for the CGI pumpjacks every 30 ft), but man, I really did cringe throughout. I have great pride over where I'm from, and I was hoping this movie would scratch that little homesick itch I feel from time to time. I think that a movie like Bernie did a far better job of portraying some wacky Texans, but they were mostly real-life actual people, too.

As an aside, I wish we could have gotten a sense of how much acreage ""the ranch"" really was, because it seemed like they owned two pastures right near a highway. And in those two pastures they were able to place enough pumpjacks to get $50k in royalties a month?!

And yes, bolo ties are truly few & far between in these parts, and in my experience, are usually worn by ""city types"" who wish to portray a certain kind of rugged look.",4zm7w2

Lines like ""These concealed carry licenses sure do complicate a bank robbery"", the most obvious political plug I've seen in a movie in a quite a while. Every single character had some witty, Texas dialogue too, as you kind of got at, from the t-bone steak waitress, to the other waitress, to the random guy driving the truck at the first bank robbery, etc. etc. So tiresome.",4zm7w2

I watched the trailer and it looked really good, but I don't like typical horror movies. To put things in perspective my 3 favorite scary movies are the mothman prophecies, silent hill and the exorcism of Emily Rose. All of these are light on jump scares and heavily based on psychological and other forms of horror. I really like when a movie can scare me without jump scares. I also LOVED stranger things but that's a tv show. Sorry I know this is random but I'm a little bitch about horror movies and wanted an opinion before watching ",4zm7w2

Texas was never quite that bad but they were plenty of families that lost their homes in the wake of the economic collapse. 

We're also seeing these things from the perspective of Toby as this is his story.

d9y9ssh,"Depends on the well. (Just using very general numbers for example, all leases and wells vary...) Let's say a well produces 100 bbl/day. Let's say $50/bbl is the current value of oil (a few years ago it was $100+/bbl). That's $5,000/day revenue. 30 days a month equals $150,000/mo revenue. Now that revenue is split between the lessee and lessor. Typical oil lease is for about 1/8 to 1/4 royalty. Let's say 1/5 or 20% for our example. $150,000/mo x 20% = $30,000/mo in royalty. Now that's just one well. And that's assuming only 100 bbl/day and only $50/bbl oil prices. A brand new well in the Permian could be around that number. These are just rough estimate numbers, but I think the figure in the movie is reasonable.  ",4zm7w2

dd77t8t,"The implication seems to be that Rayburn has knowledge of the camera changeover issues at Texas Midlands. Between this and the direct instructions on how to wash the money and satisfy the lien, the implication is that Toby asked Rayburn what to do, and Rayburn loosely explained how to organize the robberies.

As to how long it takes to initiate a $40,000 loan on a property known to have highly productive mineral assets, the answer a couple of days.  Moreover, the courts would provide an injunction against any such repossession until the loan was finalized.  If Rayburn is even a remotely experience lawyer (which me must be given his knowledge of how the original lien works), he must know this.

Benchmark that against the time and money needed to acquire 3 stolen cars, the heavy equipment to bury such cars, an illegally obtained fully automatic assault rifle, and the time to case (or at least discover the basic layout and timetable of) 4 separate banks. ",4zm7w2
