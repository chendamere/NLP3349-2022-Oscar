e77adpg,There were parts where I thought it was a Lady Gaga origin story,9li7w0
e79f6to,"“Music is essentially any note between twelve octaves. Twelve notes and the octave repeats. It’s the same story told over and over. All that the artist can offer the world is how they see those twelve notes.”

Really loved this quote, and it made me wonder if they were playing along to the fact that this is just a retelling of an older story from a different point of view.",9li7w0
e78phav,"I thought it was a nice touch at the end where they flash to Jackson singing ""I'll never love again"" but in his normal voice as opposed to his ""brother's voice"". It felt that it showed that Jackson had found himself through Ally.",9li7w0
e77d1ru,Was it just me or was the cinematography really great? I’ve never noticed it to the point of stopping my viewing of a movie to compliment it.,9li7w0
e79cssi,"I haven't seen any previous versions of A Star Is Born, so I'm not sure where credit is due for this, but it's beautifully poetic that he starts their relationship by completing one of her song ideas, and she honors him at the end by completing one of his.",9li7w0
e76x4kc,"The look in Jack's eyes as he realizes he would end up being the reason Ally would not be heard was heart breaking.

His last song was his suicide note, though I'm not sure if he knew it at the time.

Final notes:

The dog outside the garage was what broke me.

Fuck that agent guy.",9li7w0

e798s9x,"Any recovering alcoholics in the thread?  I knew it was gonna be tough, but holy shit....seeing him be so mean to her in the bathtub, and the Grammys, that hit me harder than the ending (which was also excellent)

Also when his brother told him “I told you but you were drunk”, that hit hard too

I’m six months in, I don’t know if I could have done it earlier in my sobriety....great job by all",9li7w0
e77l6b1,I think Ally becomes a Star in the final scene of the film. Although she achieved mainstream fame she wasn’t being true to herself and Jack could see it. When he tells her having something to say and a way to say it so that people listen is what really matters...and she delivers the final performance of the film...after such a shocking and tragic turn of events...the most incredible performance of all time! ,9li7w0
e7imhjr,A scene I don't see talked about: Ally meets Jack in rehab and he breaks down crying and apologizing for embarrassing her. Such a great scene. ,9li7w0
e76zbdf,"It's honestly baffling to me how this movie was so good.  I mean, it is a pretty standard story that hits all the normal beats, but everything is so well done that it really elevates it.  My only complaint (and this says a lot), is that I thought it should have been a half hour longer.  I wanted more Chappelle, more Diceman, more everything really.  I ALWAYS complain that movies are 20-30 minutes too long and this is the first time in a long time I thought a film would have benefited greatly from a little more breathing room.",9li7w0
e7f4nbt,"There was some obvious foreshadowing throughout the movie, but something I noticed was how Jackson offered up his vinyl collection to Ally's dad. It's never a good sign when someone starts giving away the things they have spent years collecting without thinking twice. ",9li7w0
e76x44x,"Jack struggling to tell his brother that he was the one he always looked up to, not their father, absolutely gutted me. And Ally’s first experience on stage with Jack was another moment that sent shivers down my spine. Amazing film, looking forward to seeing it again. ",9li7w0
e77anf8,That cut at the very end where we transition from Ally on stage to her and Jackson at the piano. Good lord that released the tear buckets for me. Hands down one of the best moments of editing I’ve seen all year,9li7w0
e777ooz,"Holy shit, their chemistry. Insane. I could go on and on about the different aspects that I loved. Especially the little things. Like the title drop at the beginning felt like a throwback to 70s or 80s films and got me smiling right away. Great film.",9li7w0
e76y19v,Sam Elliott backing the truck up trying to hold back tears gave me all of the emotions. Absolutely loved this movie. Shattered my heart. Hated the manager from the moment he came on screen. Dick.,9li7w0
e78scbl,I went to her Joanne tour and was amazed that they actually shot a scene there. You can really tell that without Gaga the scope of the movie would’ve been probably much smaller with very different music. I also loved the SNL bit with Alec Baldwin. I had no idea they shot that. ,9li7w0
e7ba8d0,Getting high and seeing this movie after getting broken up with my girlfriend of eight years was ill-advised.,9li7w0
e792vpx,"I thought Gaga couldn't do it, but walked out remembering the 80's when all of a sudden we all realized that Cher was a great fucking actress and started racking up Oscar nominations left and right, for multiple roles.  Gaga killed it.  She's on her way.",9li7w0

e76xhbv,"An aspect to the dialog I really liked was that they would frequently talk over each other. It made it feel a lot more real to me. Also when they're in the bar, they struggle to hear each other and it just plays like a very natural conversation. A small aspect of the movie that just really made it for me.",9li7w0
e7bb4r8,I love the fact Bradley Cooper gave Lady Gaga first billing. It really showed how much he respects her. ,9li7w0
e76z4eu,The first time Jack brings Ally on stage and her performance had me fucking crying in the theater ,9li7w0
e76wuxb,Bradley Cooper sure has come a long way since The Hangover. Dude has some serious talent. ,9li7w0
e76wn2h,"I probably should have looked up the plot of the originals beforehand. That ending brought back so many feelings from the past (that I’m thankfully past now) - feelings of dragging your friends and family down, and that it’s all due to the weight of your own failures. 

Fantastic movie, top tier performances, one of my favorites of the year, never want to see it ever again. ",9li7w0
e78n7nf,My SO said he didn't really know what she looked like until seeing this movie. She's gorgeous. ,9li7w0
e7bb1i9,"This movie could have also been called ""Try not to cry. Cry a lot."" ",9li7w0
e7d9aq9,"People don't realize it's not about her becoming a star. It's about what had to be lost for her to be a star. The sacrifice of him to make her successful, to not drag her down any more ",9li7w0
e76wto2,"Just got back from it, and wow. 

Bradley Cooper has had some great performances already in his career, but this was another level. Just phenomenal. The songs are amazing too. 

Reading reviews after seeing it, and I honestly, sincerely did not recognize Andrew Dice Clay. Thought the father had some really great undestated moments, and was kinda jaw dropped to read in a review Andrew Dice Clay played the dad. 

Honestly, probably will see it again to just listen to the songs again. The movie hit on an emotional level with the self sabotage that Jack keeps doing. Loved the movie overall. ",9li7w0
e78k7sw,The last 30 seconds of this movie. Holy. ,9li7w0
e779h3b,"Lady Gaga snd Bradley Cooper were absolutely brilliant. Everything about this movie was wonderful. The music. The story. Everything.

Also, I loved seeing Shangela and Willam on the big screen. “I got my Jackson titties on!”",9li7w0
e78kynj,When he was trying to talk to her in the bathtub.   You know what he wanted to say but he was too fucked up to say it.  He wanted to tell her to be herself and she didn't need all of the stupid gimmicks but he couldn't find the words and then just he just got mean because of his own drunken frustration.  ,9li7w0
e76xm25,"Man the foreshadowing with the 4 nooses on the billboard that sloooooooooowly panned when Jackson was in the SUV told me I was in for a rough time.

The movie is just brutal to watch. I mean that in the sense that you knew exactly would happen but couldn't turn away. That is a compliment to just how convincing the cast was and just how well directed this film was. Good stuff man. Credit to every single person that was involved in some way or form. A masterpiece of a film IMO. I foresee at least 6 or 7 nominations come Academy Award season. 

I highly recommend that everyone watch it in the Dolby Cinema at AMC if you get the chance. The music and editing sounded and looked outstanding in the theater.",9li7w0
e77785w,"Part that got me most was her singing at the very end and her hair was back to its natural color. Tears!

Overall really liked the film, he acted the best of the two but she of course had him over singing. Equaled out to a great movie, glad I saw it! Was actually a lot funnier I was expecting but in that natural not forced way? ",9li7w0
e7c8809,"I really liked this whole movie but I must say that Bradley Cooper was especially amazing in the last 10 minutes. After the 1 on 1 with Ally’s manager, I expected him to punch him and kick him out of the house or something. I’m so glad this film avoided that cliche. Instead, Jack is just destroyed and it gets even worse when he is lying in bed with Ally and she tells him she cancelled the tour to spend time with him. Ally was always supportive of him and truly loved him. She said that because she cares for him. The part that broke me was when the camera closed up on Jacks face during this scene. His eyes looked like they lost all hope and he looked like he felt as if he was a failure. It was honestly so sad since he knew that he was responsible for her decision. His eyes were like a portal into his soulless soul. It was brilliant. Gave me chills. He needs to win an Oscar for this movie! That scene deserves so much praise and I really think it should be talked about more! ",9li7w0
e77g8hq,"That final 20 minutes contained some of the most ruthless scene transitions I’ve ever seen. Gaga thanking her husband for coming in the midst of concert hysteria, while the scene cuts to a completely silent shot of the garage with the dog in front of it fucking killed me.

Overall, I loved it. It’s not without its flaws, but Coopers directing and the amazing chemistry and performances from the two main actors absolutely makes up for them. Might be the best film I’ve seen so far this year and the best way to kick off Oscar season.

Edit: so far this year",9li7w0
e78jaxv,"The Grammy acceptance speach was pure torture, I was clenching every available muscle in my body from cringe.",9li7w0
e7acvtn,"Did anyone else catch Cooper talking about his dad and mentioned Pecans...and before the film started there was a trailer for Mule, which he's in with Clint Eastwood who is covering up a bag full of drugs by delivering pecans",9li7w0
e77qst6,The emotion in this movie was so believable that 12 hours later I'm still tearing up thinking about it. I can see why Gaga died her hair blonde to escape the character asap. So tragic to have that kind of love and lose it because you love that person more than yourself. One small part that got to me was their fight when Jack called Ally ugly. So cruel to say that to someone when you're the one who made them believe they were beautiful in the first place. ,9li7w0
e786zb5,S/O to /u/MizCrumbbs who brought up [this interview](https://imgur.com/a/OgP3hjc) where Gaga says that she sang the final song just hours after her best friend died that day. That last ten minutes just became that much more emotional for the upcoming second viewing or soundtrack listen. Fuck.,9li7w0

e77csey,I really hope Sam Elliott isn't forgotten in awards season. He was terrific in this. ,9li7w0
e7b15e7,"I burried this response to a downvoted comment but thought it was pretty good:

The hearing loss was addressed subtly in the film to reflect Jacks fear of it. His addictions are addressed full on because there is no denying it, everybody knows and it's not something that will end his career soon. But he's terrified of his worsening tennitius. He lied to Ally about it, saying it went away while he was young and he can only truthfully talk about it while in rehab when he gets sober. He drove his brother away because he was the only person pushing him to address the issue. Seeing his hearing get worse throughout the film was heartbreaking. The rest of it was too, I just think it was kept subtle for a reason. He was running from it.

e776sox,This movie theatre experience was like going to black panther opening night except instead of the theatre being mostly black people it was mostly gay men and let me just tell you I'm here for it ,9li7w0
e77t9vb,"I thought the premise of this movie (already a multi-remake) sounded so cliché and done before. Which it kind of is but it was still a really great movie. I'm shocked both at Cooper's directing ability and Gaga's acting talent. I massively underestimated both of them.

And while I've liked some of Gaga's pop songs before I guess I never realized how goddamn strong her voice actually is. She's just super talented and I'm glad we get to see more of her now.

(Poker Face is still a bop though)",9li7w0
e79qnzl,"That scene when she first joins him on the stage was so awesome to see on the big screen! Instant chills when she started singing, even though we all knew what was coming. 

",9li7w0
e7ajzrz,"My thoughts on the ending: 

We generally think when people commit suicide it is done at a time when they are at a bottom of some sort and their judgement is clouded, whether it's by depression or substances. When Jack made his decision, he presumably had the most clarity he'd had in years. While Rez was a monster for saying what he said, what he said wasn't necessarily untrue, and Jack knew it. This, to me, makes Jack's suicide not a ""checking out"" to spare himself further pain, but more a self sacrifice for the good of Ally. This movie slayed me. ",9li7w0
e77ewgp,"Completely fell for the motorcycle trick. Going into the movie, I was curious how Cooper was going to die, and when Ally sees the motorcycle earlier in the film and says ""you better not drive that while drunk"", I thought for sure that it was for shadowing. 

Flash forward to the end, and the motorcycle is in full view, teasing that he might start driving it. And then Cooper takes it in a completely different direction. ",9li7w0
e76wv36,"Really enjoyed this. I was really hype for it because I think Cooper and Gaga are both so insanely talented but even with the expectations it lived up. It's not perfect but there's a lot to love.

The love story here is strong. I loved how they go through ups and downs but they never fall out of love. And their interactions are so charming and fun when the movie isn't dealing with hardcore addiction. It's a lot of fun to watch until it isn't but even then it's still quality and hard hitting.

Also, I know this doesn't need to be said, but Gaga's voice holy shit. She's so good. And the music is great all over this thing. Props to Cooper too, you can barely recognize him in this. His voice is so raw I really bought his character. And him and Gaga are the perfect pair, I really felt like I was getting a look at Fame and the music industry. You could feel that this was so personal to both of them.

The story is what you'd expect but it's also not. I kept waiting for her manager to try and fuck her or for him to go too far and hit her but it didn't go there and I appreciated that. I can see why this movie keeps getting remade. It's a picture of what Fame is and that idea changes even while it stays the same. Much like the notes in the scale like Sam Elliot says.

Speaking of Sam, killer performances from all the supports. Chappelle, Andrew Dice Clay, and I think Sam Elliot is locked in for a supporting nomination.

The ending really got to me. The montage was hard enough but when it cut to him singing the song for her the first time. Oof. I think this is currently the movie to beat for awards sweeps.

I might have more to say later, I just walked out, but right now I'm feeling a solid 8/10. ",9li7w0
e7j4v9u,"That movie was something else. I absolutely loved it. I've never been as moved, emotional, disturbed or heartbroken by a movie before. Their chemistry was amazing, I had thoughts of maybe it's more than just acting, but they're just damn good actors. 

I didn't know the story before this, I did not know he ends up killing himself. I didn't realize the nooses on the billboard was foreshadowing; I just saw them & thought he's at a very low point and is contemplating. I like that the story was more about him & his demons. You could tell his suicide was a very long time coming; he had been thinking about it since he was an adolescent. Straight out of rehab, newly sober & very vulnerable. He already thought that no one needed, wanted or cared about him, as well as that he was a burden to everyone. Ally's manager confirmed those feelings becoming that final straw. Jack's death was so heartbreaking & haunting. It's been a few days and I'm still crying over it. As soon as he fed the dog a steak there was no will he/won't he, it turned into oh no please don't. Ally's grief felt a little rushed, but was very believable as well. 

I thought Bradley's acting was incredible. He's actually been sober from alcohol & drugs since 2004, which is part of the reason why his acting is so good. Because he knows first hand about depression, suicidal ideation and substance abuse. 

&#x200B;",9li7w0
e79lisg,"I cried when Bradley sang in the bar. Something about the work he put into his vocals and the weight and pain of the lyrics on his character (that we don’t quite yet know what pushed him to booze and drugs) were sheer beauty. 

Notice he said when you get famous people call you by your full name and Gaga’s character became known as just Ally?",9li7w0

e7nijtx,"I’m here for the fucking support group, lol

I’ve been scrolling through to see how this movie affected other people who have loved anyone with depression mixed with alcohol + opiate addiction, or who has struggled with that themselves.  I had never heard of this movie, I didn’t know it had other incarnations so I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I didn’t even really care to see it, my date picked the movie.  I had to duck out when it ended to “go to the bathroom” aka hide and cry and been crying all morning since I woke up, 😬  

There were just way too many extremely accurate subtle details.... 

the way Jack talked when he was drunk and high..

the scene when Ally thinks they’re going to have passionate sex after their first performance, but he passes out instead..

When Ally says “oh, it’s fine, he does this all the time”

Ally considering leaving her career and personal dreams because she wants to be there for him,

Jack pissing himself, 

His admitted shame and embarrassment over it all and inner depression and how deep his emotions are, 

Those lyrics in “I’ll never love again”

Of course, the suicide

I haven’t contacted my loved one in a couple months in an effort to emotionally detach from him but now I want to call him and see how he’s doing? :/ 

It was a good movie but I kind of wish I didn’t see it.  It doesn’t help that the song “Shallow” remained completely stuck in my head because it’s so damn catchy.

On a side note, I never really listened to Lady Gaga, I’m not really a pop music fan but her voice really blew me away

e7zek8h,"Not that he has a chance to read this or even know but my heart goes out to the old man and his wife that left when Jackson Mayne went on his last binge. They knew what was coming and left. 

The wife told the husband to not look at the screen and hold her hand as they exited. I'm sorry for your loss and it made my heart hurt for y'all. ",9li7w0
e775yoz,"On a slightly more sober note, this movie is the epitome of a crowd-pleaser. It doesn't break much new ground (as would be expected from a FOURTH version\* of a concept) but it executes what it sets out to do *phenomenally* well.

Gaga is a revelation as the titular star. Bradley Cooper is even better - all the more remarkable considering that it's a self-directed performance. He's charismatic, raw, and so fundamentally believable throughout in a role that could have easily veered into ham.  And he & Gaga have exceptional onscreen chemistry - like, ""I have never found him hot in a movie until now, even though he was playing a beat-up alcoholic, because the chemistry was THAT good"" level chemistry. It does a lot to sell the movie as whole.

The concert scenes are maybe some of the best I have seen in a movie? They have so much ENERGY to them. Also it's just a really beautifully-shot film in general. And so many of the songs are BOPS too, even the ones that are supposed to be the \~vapid pop songs.",9li7w0
e791u61,"What I loved about this version of A Star Is Born, is that the male lead is not jealous of his wife. He gave everything, every part of himself because all he wanted to do was to help Ally fully realise her potential. The moment he realised that he was the one holding her back was unbearable for him.

It's a beautiful yet very sad sentiment. ",9li7w0

e7h4je1,"Just saw this movie. Man that final scene of them laying down in the bed and saying bye is so heavy. You could just feel what was coming with all of the unspoken things between them.

e76wy98,"Can you imagine taking a time machine to 2009 back when Poker Face or Bad Romance was everywhere and showing somebody this movie? Or having them listen to something like “I’ll Never Love Again”? 

As someone who’s only seen Lady Gaga act in American Horror Story and wasn’t impressed by that, she absolutely blew it out of the water here. ",9li7w0
e77g2pz,"I loved it. 
-	Great debut from Bradley directing. It would have been easy for him to fall into self aggrandisement but a lot of the time even when his character was talking he kept the camera on the someone listening instead.
-	Beautiful songs, the best ballads of Gaga's career. She will win the Oscar.
-	Casting her was a stroke of genius as her performance works on levels, as someone who has experienced the career of her character, and we the audience know that - there is a meta story. You never forget she's Gaga but at the same time, she's also authentically her character.
-	One point of critique, there are essentially no female characters in this movie besides Ally. Maybe it was intentional. Chapelle's wife gets one line off screen and that's it.
-	The theme of stardom means some scenes are 'big' but the love story is touching enough to keep you involved and makes something unrelatable feel relatable, the extra ordinary feel ordinary.
-	Best romantic chemistry of Bradley's career and his best performance.
-	If you have loved someone with addiction or depression it will be especially poignant.",9li7w0
e7939dv,"Wow. WOW. I echo all the thoughts that have been said already; this movie was a sucker punch to the gut in all the best ways.

One small thing I noticed was the fact that her ring changed. That simple piece of wire was, by the end of the film, a *humongous* diamond ring, paralleling her own transformation into this out-of-this-world pop star, this step into a grandiose and dazzling life. The memory of that simplicity lingered, but it was lost somewhere along the way.

Just one of those quiet details that made the film so fantastic.",9li7w0
e76x9ym,"A was expecting some solid musical performances from Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, but I was absolutely blown away. Their performances, musically and theatrically, really hit me hard, along with the cast members performances. Sam Elliot's scene near the end when he is told by Jack that he idolized him, and the shot of him driving off, made it hard to not get a bit weepy eyed.

I didn't expect there to be a character that I would hate, but that manager made me want to see Jack violently tell him to get the hell out of his home.

My Favorite scene was the ending when it cut to Jack finishing the end of his song in the home he always wanted as a kid.

Watch this movie and don't be afraid to feel sad afterwards and/or in-between.",9li7w0
e784uf3,"I kept thinking of it as, when a star is destroyed, another star is born.  

Beautiful last shot. You see her pain and nostalgia while being reminded she is a star now. ",9li7w0
e76xizz,"One thing that really stood out to me the most watching this movie was the production value throughout. The concert scenes looked like something straight out of a concert film and I really enjoyed the extra scenes of the moments backstage such as when Ally walked through the stadium being lead by the assistant and the sequence of her performing in Saturday Night Live. It really felt like the studio had a lot of confidence in Bradley Cooper as a director and I feel like those moments made it feel like you’re a part of the performers on and off the stage as well.

And I feel like the main thing that makes or breaks a film like this is the chemistry between the lead actors. I thought the chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga was fantastic as well with Gaga stealing the show in every scene she’s in. This is definitely a breakout role for her and her voice is always a pleasure to hear. Cooper isn’t too bad either, I didn’t know the dude can sing but there he is. Lol",9li7w0
e7bakfa,"One thing I noticed about the movie was the music - and the restraint of how it was used. The only time music was played on screen was during performances, montage sequences, and as diegetic sound. During dramatic scenes they didn’t play any overbearing music, it was just raw, realistic sound and dialogue. Great directing choice by Cooper.

Great film overall too. Loved the lighting and camera choices, the editing, and of course Gaga. It’s deserving of all the praise it’s getting.",9li7w0

I am a huge dog Lover...so the addition of a dog in this version of A Star is Born really tugged at my already weakened heart strings.

Jackson's hat, Ally's face (nose, hair, eyes looking directly at the camera), the fisheye lens when Jackson is on stage, blinding lights (on stage but also in the garage, positioned like stage lights), repeated lyrics  (including but not limited to ""maybe it's time to let the old ways die"" and ""we're far from the shallow now""). The world that these characters inhabit comes to life because of these little touches and lends the film an honesty and authenticity that a lot of other movies lack.

One other point, I was blown away by the immediate and effortless mythologizing of Jackson Maine in the film's early scenes. This character is so earnest and the day-to-day experiences he has with his fame are so organic that I immediately forgot that I was watching Bradley Cooper.",9li7w0

e7x9366,"Movie was phenomenal. 

One thing I thought was interesting was that it always seemed like he was going to fuck up his show, but then never did. He was always able to perform. Which is maybe a nod to how functional he was as an addict. He was good at his job despite being fucked up all the time, but the real impact was on his personal life. I just thought that was an interesting way to take the direction. Each performance was prefaced with scenes of him getting hammered, I always thought he was about to blow it, but he never did (obviously he did in other ways). ",9li7w0
e88o3zh,"Wow I know this was Gaga’s show and she deserves a lot of praise, but man Bradley Cooper can direct and act! I was incredibly impressed by everything he did. Especially that scene when he realizes Ally is lying to him about Europe. He kept preaching “find your voice” the whole movie and when he realized he was taking away her voice he knew he had to go. He sacrificed his life because he knew she was great, truly great. Better than he ever was, and he wanted to give her another chance to find her real voice. This culminates in the final song where Ally/Gaga gives the performance of a lifetime! That’s when the Star was born, up till that she was a hot pop star but she channeled Whitney Houston and so many others in a tour de force. I also noticed how Jackson said you only become really famous when they say your full name. Ally up until the final song was just Ally, but then became Ally Maine. Very good movie, definitely deserves some Oscars. If Bradley is walking home in February without one for directing or acting, he’s been robbed.",9li7w0

I never watched any of the previous ASIB, so I went in blind and was just amazed. I could see how it was going to end, but the way they built it up to the suicide was just heart-jerking. It was a long movie, but for the most part I felt they made every minute count.

That last minute just hit really the hardest. To go from Lady Gaga singing the song, switching over to Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga having that lovely moment... Then flipping back to Gaga's sorrowful expression in the last few seconds really got me.

There is no way that Bohemian was better than ASIB.....what in the actual FUCK. Cooper poured his heart and soul into this movie. Producing, screenwriting, directing, acting, singing, song writing, and playing the guitar....not to mention, it was the BEST movie I have seen in decades. I prepared myself that Lady Gaga may not win best actress, although imo she deserved to.....but to NOT award Cooper with best actor was a travesty. Malik was okay as Freddy, but he did not actually sing. If he, Malik that is, had an ounce of integrity, he would have thanked the foreign press, said that he worked hard on Bohemian, but RECOGNIZED that the award belonged to Cooper, walked off stage and placed said award in front of Cooper. Then Bradley could have just left it there on the table. I will NEVER AGAIN watch the Globes because they are a fucking JOKE .",9li7w0

It almost seemed like a valid statement to me that no one is willing to say in times like those. But then again I know there's no way Ally would choose her career over him no matter how much he struggled. She loved him more than anything. So I've come to the conclusion the manager is an external representation of everything an addict hears in his or her own head every day.

Two questions: did anyone catch what Jack says to Bobby when Bobby takes him home after rehab? It's been bothering me because it was obviously a very important line but I didn't quite get it. Sounded like he said ""It wasn't dad I liked, it was you"" but I couldn't be sure. Also, what was the significance of Jack ""stealing Bobby's voice""?

I saw the movie last night and I can’t stop thinking about it or listening to the soundtrack. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so deeply about a film. The love story alone (how they meet, how he helps her find her voice, etc.) is incredibly beautiful just by itself. Cooper and Gaga’s chemistry is just oozing off the screen. Everything about it is so real and authentic. I had not seen the previous versions and didn’t know how it would end, although as the film went on I had a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. The last conversation between the two of them felt so FINAL. His suicide shattered my heart into a million pieces. I couldn’t stop crying in the theater or on the way home. The shot of the dog outside the garage is going to haunt me for a long time.

Bradley Cooper disappeared (in a good way) into Jackson Maine. At one point I didn't even recognize him with how well he portrayed his character. I really thought he did an amazing job. 

I feel like from a directing standpoint Cooper took some risks and I appreciated it. There are some flaws here and there but I liked the way the film was put together.

This movie lifted up that kind of unconditional love as the most beautiful thing in the world - the only thing that really matters - and yet it still wasn’t enough to save him.  

I loved my brother so much and stood by him through everything - he knew I would do anything for him and that I never saw him as anything less than a wonderful human being despite all his mistakes and shame. Yet he still hated himself.  How can love be the pinnacle of life and yet fall so short?

e7hxsxv,"Psych perspective:  most of the people I’ve talked to about this film seem to think it’s about the rise&fall of game, addiction, and love.  I found that it also tackles mental illness.  Jack seems to be dealing with depression which he masks with alcoholism.  Even when he goes through rehab you can sense he is unhappy with his life.  When Ally’s manager speaks to him it triggers not only how unhappy he is with himself but also how everyone around him has been affected by his actions.  I do not blame his suicide on anyone else other than him but having someone finally call him out for his actions brings to light what he’s felt all along.  Similar to the real world, this is a situation we often hear about in the media.  So many celebrities have committed suicide and most of which had issues with addictions.  I believe the movies exemplifies this very well.  It never actually lets us know that Jack is dealing with internal demons.  While watching I felt that his alcoholism was more so a result of the rockstar lifestyle and later a result of watching Ally become a generic pop star for which he blames himself.  It wasn’t until after finishing the movie and thinking about it that I realized its just another example of how well some people hide mental illness regardless of their status in society.  Thoughts? ",9li7w0
e7iqh9i,"(I had no knowledge of any prior films, and knew nothing of the storyline)

Not having had to personally deal with the demons Jack has in the film, I actually (and quite possible naively) thought he ""was fine"" when he came out of rehab.   ...that he could have gone on and supported her in her career while leaving his behind.

And then a real Demon in the flesh shows up - planting those seeds in his brain and he had no chance.

Its amazing in his last scene with Ally that the viewer ""just knew"" what was going to happen.  Her language, the music, his eyes and demeanor... whatever it was, its a credit to the filmmaking if a shallow person like myself with no plotline knowledge can see that jump off the screen.

great film!

**I'll never meet the ground**: unlike his unsuccessful attempt as a child, he does not meet the ground this time

As soon as I saw Jackson put that steak down for Charlie, I knew what was happening. Seeing Charlie curl up in a ball outside of the garage absolutely smashed my heart.",9li7w0
ebwsng9,"The amount of comments stating this movie implies suicide is a good thing is worrying.

Throughout the entire movie, we see Jackson struggle with heavy issues stemming from his childhood. Depression, alcoholism, drug abuse. He even attempted suicide as a teenager. So there is an obvious history that leads you to think this might be an ending for a drama film. That's not a statement on morality of suicide. The film neither says it's good or bad, just that people who deal with these issues sometimes choose to end their lives to end the suffering they are causing themselves and others.

What it does show is that for all of Jackson's intentions of making life easier for himself, his wife, and even Bobby, he fails. Why? Because his selfishness leads to them suffering for him even after his own suffering is done. They are sad and Ally is blaming herself, and Bobby even says this wasn't her fault or his own, but Jackson's, because he chose to do what he did. It doesn't necessarily condemn the act, but it shows that people who are so stuck in their own suffering can't see the harm they do to their loved ones.

Ally's last words in the song are that she'll never love again. Is that just something she feels at the moment or is it genuine and accurate? Only time will tell (well, nothing but your imagination since it's a work of fiction). But a guy killing himself and leaving a young woman whose life and ambitions were being fulfilled to believe she'll never love again doesn't seem to imply suicide is good.

The movie just shows that it happens. And people will eventually move on like Ally has by finally singing his song, but emotionally, there will always be a hole left in those who have been abandoned. Just because people didn't get the happy ending they didn't want, doesn't mean they should condemn a movie for giving a message it frankly didn't tell.

And I don't even think the movie was all that incredible so this is not coming from a fanboy perspective. It was solid with some decent performances and a few impactful scenes.

The performances of both leads were stunning but I think Bradley's was the best. This is the first time I completely forgot I was watching Bradley Cooper, he disappeared into the role and said so much with just his expressions. Also, who knew he was such a great singer! I adored his singing voice and thought him and Lady Gaga sounded amazing together, their performance of 'Shallow' gave me chills it was that good. It was also great to see an Alias reunion as both Greg Grunberg and Ron Rifkin shared scenes with Bradley.

I hope this will be a contender at the Oscars, I would love to see Bradley win best actor and at least a nomination for best director and best picture would be well deserved. I also think it deserves best song for the song Lady Gaga sings at the end.

e7psyg2,"The discussion around this film needs to be separated between what we felt and what we thought.

&#x200B;

What I thought: The film is incredibly strong for about 80% of the time. The cinematography, sound direction, sound editing, storytelling, acting, songs - everything about it feels genuine and grounded....about 80% of the time. There were some missteps. I found the agent character to be one-dimensional and not very grounded in reality (especially in a movie where everyone else around him is so grounded and well-realized). I found the pacing to be only just slightly off, though I felt as there were some points it was inevitable (especially toward the end after Jackson gets out, but before things go downhill again - there's no way to bring the audience back to ""we're good again"" and then ""oh no we're not good"" in such a short time. Also I thought the way that the scenes in between set up the song she sings at the end beautifully). But aside from the 1D manager and the pacing, everything landed. and oh boy did it land.  


What I felt: This movie destroyed me. I vowed to see it twice - once to get the emotional experience and once to view it critically. And I actually ended up feeling it more the second time. As someone who's attempted suicide a few times and had someone very very close to them commit suicide, this movie vibrated with reality. The shot that completely wrecked me was after he kills himself, she is sat at the piano, trying desperately to pluck out a tune. Her face is wrinkled in this amazing sad face that just completely broke me. 

\-Bradley Cooper surprises in this role. Really surprises. He has such an insane depth as this character- a career best, in my opinion. He sings well enough to keep up with Gaga, and that's saying something. His acting is amazing, and his directorial debut is visionary. This is the first movie that (for me) has accurately captured what it's like to go see live music. BC has a serious future and I love his work on and behind the camera.

\-Lady Gaga is truly brilliant in this role. She face-acts her ass off. Her performance is absolute veritè - everything rings true. Her singing and her performance completely sells everything about her character. I like that they didn't make her a saint either - she snipes Cooper in one scene so perfectly, I was worried the movie was going to make her a villain. Her standout moments - the one described above, her interactions with her father, and her final performance. What an absolute star on the rise.

\-Sam Elliot is brilliant. Not very surprising - we knew he's a hell of an actor already. His performance is still remarkable (especially the now-infamous truck scene)

\-Andrew Dice Clay started out a bit rough for me, but I grew to love him. He's just a likable guy - he's genuine and real and wonderful at acting.

\-Anthony Ramos (as a very small character) was a lot of fun. I liked him a lot.

\-The ""drag bar"" addition was a lot of fun. Loved seeing some familiar faces (Willam, Shangela, etc)

\-Out of all the iterations of this story (minus Garland on ""The Man That Got Away""), the songs in this movie are easily the strongest. ""Black Eyes"", ""Shallow"", ""I'll Always Remember Us This Way"", ""Heal Me"", ""Is That Alright"", and ""I'll Never Love Again"" are all amazing (there are also full versions of all the snippets in the movie on the soundtrack, as well as some completely deleted songs that are GEMS)  


So yeah - this movie is not a 100 but it's pretty damn close, and a wonderful ticket purchase for anyone.",9li7w0
e7ryyjk,"Haven't had a movie that affected me like this in a long time. A lot hit really close to home. I am a bigger music fan than movie critic so here are some thoughts on that regard:

Jackson Maine music stylistically = Lukas Nelson & PTOR. Pretty clear that's where the inspiration came from (given that the band was in the movie) but see people debating it so wanted to clear that up. Neil Young / Allman Bros I guess could be considered influences too. 

From a personal style/mannerism standpoint BC's Jackson Maine = Eddie Vedder. Uncanny the mannerisms, way of speaking, heck even delivery of certain lines.

Jackson and Ally's love story was so beautiful. Helping your love find their voice. The SNL scene hit me so hard in terms of what the mainstream music industry requires artists to do. When Jackson jumped off the wagon to get a beer I was so pissed off I wanted to do the exact same thing. 

I've seen other people lament the ""cliched and overdone"" aspect of the ""fallen star"" story. It may have been done before but it is still relevent...I couldn't help but think of Chris Cornell in the film's final act and especially Sam Elliott's response.

Lastly - wow what a commentary about the impact of darkness/tragedy on art/artists. Past demons drove Jackson's success and worthy voice, and he provided Ally the same. His loss shook her from the mainstream industry BS and gave her a reason to speak her voice yet again.",9li7w0

One, that A Star was put in the drama category and not the musical comedy ? Particularly with a soundtrack released from the movie...a definite musical.

Two, That Sam Elliott was snubbed as a best supporting actor nominee ? I get that his screen time was minimal, but the scenes he was in were pivitol,and he was amazing in them.

I LOVED the movie, have seen it seven times now. The best movie I have seen in decades. I really hope the Oscars at least nominate Sam Elliott. Also, I would LOVE to see Leo DiCaprio hand the Golden Globe and Oscar to Lady Gaga. Bradley Cooper should have a lock on Best Actor with both awards....he will forever be Jackson Maine to me.",9li7w0

eh2psgs,"Just finished it. I agree with a lot of people that the first hour was fantastic. I would say the clear demarcation point is when her career starts to take off and their paths start diverging. I'm not sure how far to criticize that since I know that's essentially the story they're telling. But I just didn't feel engaged with the second half. It felt rushed somehow. Like one minute she's living at home with her dad and he's selling out concerts and the next minute she's winning Grammys and he's having to perform backup to some kid and I felt like I missed how they got there. And I know that's sort of the point. That fame is fleeting. But it just didn't really seem to translate well into this particular narrative. For me anyway. 
 
Having said that, I thought the performances were great. Music was great. Cooper did a great job directing. I kind of want to punch that weaselly producer in the face after that little diatribe he gives to Jackson towards the end. Too bad that Ally wasn't there because she would have kicked his ass. Old Ally would have anyway.",9li7w0

What stuck out to me was in the scene in the beginning with Jack and Ally at the bar, he says something along the lines of how when you’re famous, everyone says your full name and then asks her to call him “Jack”. Unless I missed it, you don’t really hear Ally’s last name through the movie. Even her during her “Popstar” phase she goes as just “Ally”. In the last scene before the performance, she’s introduced as “Ally Maine”, the first (and only?) time we hear her whole name, showing us the moment when the Star was Born. ",9li7w0

e7k01cy,"Just got home from the theatre. Ohhhhh boy was that ever a GREAT MOVIE!! The chemistry between the two was wonderful. There wasn’t a moment where they failed to convince me of their infatuation for each other. Chemistry was seeping outta the screen. The fact that all the songs and music stuff was done filmed live is near impossible to fathom. Lady Gaga is a great actress and her singing performances really cemented her as truly one of the greatest artists of our time. 


This is a soundtrack I’ll be listening to for a while.
Also a bit of a spoiler here: (but you are in a spoiler filled thread lol) the suicide scene is largely implied but still my mom who was beside me was sorta caught off guard with it mostly because years ago she had to identify a body of a family member who killed themselves the same way the character did.

e7i11i6,"Thought the acting and directing was incredible. along with an amazing soundtrack. I definitely agree with some people on here that the last quarter of the movie (if not the second half) was extremely rushed, especially his death. His suicide was impactful, but the following events lessen the emotion out of it. The scene of her laying around the house and throwing a few frames in the hallway just really didn't satisfy my need to empathize with his death. I think for one if we had seen a scene of her being told that he killed himself and her freaking out (like any person would) would have really left me in a relative state of grief but that wasn't there. You don't feel her grief at all. Then you are quickly put onto another scene where she is singing at his memorial or what have you. Seems like she would need the time to recover before that, and seeing as that all was shown was her laying around the house for around a minute in movie time, I just couldn't get behind her grief as much as I wanted to. That being said, I was unaware this film is remade and such so maybe they purposefully structured it this way. Still liked it though. 8/10.",9li7w0

One thing that I haven’t seen mentioned yet, was relating to how Ally felt during the last few scenes. If you have experienced a partner who was an alcoholic (or some other form of substance abuse) you could really feel what she was feeling during those scenes. I froze when she saw him almost fall on stage picking up his guitar pick at the Grammys. Also, when she was at the show that he didn’t show up for, she just knew... confirmed by her asking to send someone over to the house. Lots of feels. ",9li7w0

e7k7v2i,Loved the la vie en rose neon and the symbolism of the beginning and the end. Great film. ,9li7w0
ed2cd4z,"I didn't think the film did a good enough job selling the point that Jack's career was on the downslope or that he was jealous of her very well until he exploded.  He was playing to sold out amphitheaters, getting paid gigs, people super excited to see him places.  I get that he was drunk/drugged up and those are his real problems; but jealousy didn't seem to be one of them.

Otherwise I thought it was fine, but nothing really amazing.  Didn't really care too much for the songs themselves.  I really hope this doesn't get best picture this year.

I was so enthralled by the movie that the ending (even though I guessed it in the minutes preceding it) stunned me.

I like how this film shows that Jack and Ally were really the best and worst thing to happen to each other. I don't know about you guys but in my opinion, Ally never should have joined that record company. I know she got more famous from that and won a Grammy but it wasn't really her that won. The songs were not genuinely hers like what she performed with Jack. She won based on what the record company made her to be. She should have just continued singing with Jack instead of taking that deal. Also, do you think at the end, she decided to do her own deal? Because when she was singing ""I'll Never Love Again,"" wasn't her old hair back? I hope so because the only thing missing from this film was I wish Ally could have told off her manager for what he said to Jack and for interfering. But yeah, recommend everyone to see.",9li7w0

Jackson being a massive fuck-up but Ally still remaining loving and true to him was a welcome change from what would usually be a dividing wedge in these type of movies. The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga was off the charts, I'll be keen to see what recognition they get around awards season.  

Also one of the little things I liked is no matter what Jackson was on, he never had a bad show aside from like one moment during Pretty Woman. I've read enough rockstar stories to know that somehow, someway they get through shows even if they've buried their noses in snow beforehand.

e7aozju,"This film. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like they were real and it breaks my heart to think of Jack's tragic end. Ally singing the song he wrote for her at the end really hurt. I just keep thinking that I wish I could turn back time for them and have Ally sense something was up that night and cancel that concert. But then I think it wouldn't have changed anything - he felt he was holding her back, he had terrible tinnitus and so couldn't really hear her anymore and had an addiction to drugs and alcohol. Even if she had stayed, he probably still would have been in that dark dark place and may not have been able to see a way out of it.
I know it's not real, of course. Their chemistry, the way they looked at each other and talent has made me feel like it's real. Most importantly, the issues covered in the film are very real for some people.

I don't know, this film just hurt me and I can't get it out of my head. Absolutely incredible film, in my opinion. ",9li7w0

There were some odd moments in the film but it was just so good and different. I noticed not a lot of score music. Like maybe none. 

Idk if this means a thing, but one thing I realized was that his alcohol addiction was the reason he met her by chance that first night. So as much as alcoholism sucks and ruins lives, had it not been for that, they never would’ve met and her career wouldn’t have been what it was.n",9li7w0

The performances from both Cooper and Lady Gaga were both incredible, as if most of the supporting cast, especially Chapelle and Sam Elliott. Cooper especially he just really felt broken as a man, it really reminded me of Manchester by the Sea. 

The film has a lot to say about stardom, how you're seen by other people and staying true to yourself which I felt was really emphasised by the casting of Gaga. It had to be a famous singer in that role I think to really sell that idea of losing your truth. It became a really meta performance for Gaga.

I think what impressed me the most was Coopers direction, it didn't feel flat or standard. He shows real restraint as a director in terms of what he chooses to show you. There's a lot of scenes he could of milked to get everyone crying even more or get that moment in the oscars where they cut to your best scene but he knew where the focus was at all times. Like in the final song which was just incredible, he knows not to focus too much on flashbacks and keeps it on Ally. It really impressed me as a first time director. 

The film surprisingly moved quite fast which I think might be my only minor issue, and that I was heartbroken by the end of it.

This is a good if not great movie. Maybe it’s me and where I’m at in my life. I never liked Lady Gaga, I walked away in love with her. Her character reminds me slightly of the one Keira knightley  played  in almost there. Bursting with talent, wide eyed with the world and ultimately charming.

Absolute chills in my whole body, especially at the cut to Jackson at the very end - I heard people around me in the theater all softly gasp at that part.",9li7w0

If you've ever been in love this fast and this hard while coping through subtsance issues, you can fully understand and appreciate where Jack is coming from.

He wanted nothing more than to make her proud of him, but he is also weak in that he needs her by his side. He wants nothing more than for her to love him as much as he loves her (she does but he doesn't see it), but even in substance abuse, there is still pride and an unwillingness to show that weakness where she would have supported and helped him to go clean. Instead, what he sees is his reason for happiness slowly moving away from him and he relapses and lashes out at her.

When he said ""you're ugly"" he didn't mean it as an analogy to who she's become, he meant it in a physical sense. This way, he took everything back he's ever said about her and she can feel the pain and loss he's going through at the same time. He lashed out this way because as an addict, it's the only thing he knows. Anger and resentment is easier to convey then love, compassion, and weakness.

One thing many missed was that when it came to the relationship, Jack was much more open and affectionate about their love than Ally was. Jack had internal struggles with knowing if she truly loved him the way she does because she hadn't conveyed to him how she felt. The love songs in the movie that she wrote aren't about him at all, they were started before they met, but the song at the end is one he wrote to her. She was just as broken as he was but never allowed herself to slide into addiction.

Rehab helped his addiction, but didn't fully help his mental state. When Rez said what he said, Jack in his sobriety and not going back to addiction believed in his heart that he had broken beyond repair the one person he truly cared for in the world. He couldn't allow himself to go back to addiction and convinced himself that the only way to protect Ally at that point was to go away. He convinced himself that her life will be better without him. He wanted nothing more than the two to sail into the sunset, but he felt that he would drag her down to where he was as an addict and wouldn't allow that.

He was wrong, and he was never strong enough to know that.

He was also wrong in that he would never love again.

There will always be another and I hope that the one after is the one that truly helps a person into health and doesn't close off from the one they love.",9li7w0
ef5iw7q,That Grammy scene induced some of the most cringe for me I’ve experienced in a movie. And I watch Scott’s Tots for fun. ,9li7w0
e78z3oh,"Everything leading up to the finale was really well done. I thought to myself more than twice how great a job both of the leads did and Cooper as director. I also loved how natural the dialogue was; it felt almost improvised at times (it may have been, I dunno).

edit: My only complaint is that it needed about fifteen more minutes added in between Jackson getting out of rehab and hanging himself. That stretch of story needed more time to breathe.

But that finale elevated things to an even greater level. Gaga was sensational and the sudden cut away from her big closing number to the small, intimate scene with her and Cooper was the moment I finally gave in and wept.

Outstanding.",9li7w0

This is very much like Gaga's 8 Mile where it went from her doing down to earth stuff to being weird to back to being more down to Earth. Kinda semi autobiographical cept she's from New York.

I feel like I was punched in the chest and I cried for almost 4 hours after yet I'm dying to see it again. Have had trouble trying to tell people exactly how this movie made me feel but I had to try. Everyone needs to see it for themselves.

The scene where George is talking to Jack and says ""You float out at sea and then one day you find a port and say imma stay here for a few days, a few days becomes a few years, then you forgot where you were going in the first place and you realize you don't give a shit about where you were going because you like where you at"" hit very hard.

e7shwjr,"I know I'm a couple weeks late on this, but this post still looks pretty active.  This was the first version of *A Star is Born* that I have seen, for context.

What I liked: I really liked the first (though I have reservations) and third acts. I totally bought them falling in love, Ally becoming a star, and Jackson's downfall. The music was good enough that I could see it becoming popular, and Cooper and Gaga both do a great job.  I also really liked Sam Elliott and Dave Chapelle. Chapelle in particular jumped off the screen as being a real character, with his own life and past, and he's only in the movie for like five minutes. The scene at the Grammys was the most I think I ever ever cringed while watching a movie. If I didn't know going in, I never would have expected this to be a directorial debut. And Ally having her natural hair color at the end was a great touch. I didn't see the ending coming, I knew this was ""a doomed romance""

What I didn't like: The manager was a totally one-note character. For a movie that was already long, it felt like the transition to ""Ally is making soulless pop"" came really quickly. I think the same is true for the entire first act. If I have this right, they met on night 1, hung out all night until morning 2, then by night 2 she was onstage singing?  It just felt to me like that could have had some room to breathe. I don't really know what I'd propose they cut, but it was a little overstuffed. 

Nitpick corner: Someone with the stage name ""Ally"" would never become a huge pop star. She'd be called something different.

Overall I really liked this, it's a 4/5 for me and it's on my Best Picture radar (though I don't expect it will stay on my hypothetical ballot).",9li7w0
e85acpp,"I watched this movie two days ago and I am still thinking that their chemistry and the dialogue worked really well, and it felt natural. I was so surprised by that.

e88h91x,"Bradley Cooper has gone and challenged Ari Aster for the best directorial debut of 2018. While I expected a standard melodrama, Cooper delivered a raw, intense and surprisingly immersive film. He used a lot of great handheld and close ups to really get into the headspace of our two lead characters. Gaga is brilliant and as a fan of hers, I was so ecstatic to see that she has a huge amount of acting talent. While the first half is a scintillating slow-burn, the second half which involves Ally's ascent is done a bit too quickly, but it never took me out of the film because the direction and performances were so strong. Sam Elliott was also fantastic as Jackson Maine's rugged brother. Also, just give Shallow the Best Original Song Oscar now!

e88idta,"I was surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did. I liked the fact that they show her talent being used to make shitty pop music, and even though Cooper's character was way out of line when he brought it up by calling her ugly and reacting mostly out of jealousy, he did have a good point about the music she was making. I like that Lady GaGa has kind of moved out of that phase of music in later years and started making music that means a little more. ""How you gonna have an ass like that"" kind of reminds me of that ""I wanna take a ride on your disco stick"" song.

I am curious if a musician similar to his character in reality would be THAT recognizable. I don't know any rock stars who random people know them the second they see them. Even Dave Grohl could slip past a lot of people without anyone knowing who he is. ",9li7w0

I can't really fault it anywhere and just think everything works.

But no matter how many times I try to like ''Why Did You Do That'' I end up detesting it all the more, its just so damn bad, its like that song doesn't find its own style and identity, spending 3 minutes wandering through different bad beats and turns, and the lyrics are so damn cringe-worthy, like seriously, if Bradley's intention was to make us feel grossed out of this, specially after how beautiful Ally's song were before she became a pop star, then this movie and song are far more brilliant than it was to me 2 seconds ago

I love their on screen presence. They both blew me away, really. Lady Gaga will definitely receive lots of acting nominations during awards season. Bradley's directing was really good. Such a strong directorial debut. But he's acting is probably the best I've seen him do EVER. He's so good in this. He says so much with his eyes. That scene when Ally was lying to him about cancelling her tour, the look on his face was fucking heartbreaking.

I swear Lady Gaga needs to make a couple of appearances as Ally each year. She looked great with the darker hair. The character seemed more natural and less produced than her Lady Gaga persona, imo. She did excellent though. Such a beautiful and powerful voice.

The suicide scene was devastating as was Gaga's reaction afterwards. Only gripe with the movie would be the pacing, the timeline was a bit hard to keep up with at times.

And even hazes her a little like baseball players do with rookies during an interview. She took it as playful, decided to not take any of his shit, closed the door and celebrated by having sex.

To summarize: Jack continues to hammer in the importance of having something to say, but to his dismay, Ally falls deeper and deeper into the role of a generic pop star. This causes Jack to fall deeper into his alcoholism and drug abuse, as he doesn't know how else to deal with his disappointment in her and in himself for what he perceives to be a failure to steer her on the right path. In the finale of the film, largely due to what Ally's manager says to Jack, Jack comes to the realization that he will always hold her career back, and always cause her grief, and the best way to solve this is to kill himself. HOWEVER, with his final act on earth, and through Ally's own grief and self-reflection, she finally understands what Jack has been telling her all along. In her last performance she shows the world what she truly has to say, and in the very last moment of the film, ""a star is born.""",9li7w0

I am so excited by Bradley Cooper as a director. There were moments where the lens he would use to tell the story was jarring, but mostly I thought he was great at jumping in and out of intimate spaces. I loved how it would switch from a wide view to a first person view to really suck you into an intimate moment. There were so many close up views of each of them. It's funny how you could buy into Ally not being ""good looking enough"" to be a star from afar, but when that camera zoomed in and showed something raw and personal, you could see how anyone could see her beauty as he saw it. 

Their chemistry was amazing. There's something really special in those moments on stage together. I kind of just want more footage of those concerts because you really buy into them having so much fun. Man, I love them so much together, and I bought into that silly romance so much that it makes me wish they dropped their RL loves and got together!

Plus, I love where you see her performing for the first time and how insanely proud he is of her. He captured that so well and is so charming, but it also shows how powerful it is to have someone see you the way you've always wanted to be seen. I love that her talent was always there. What a fantasy it is to have been good at something for so long, to think you were good, and then to finally have others see that in you.

When I left, I thought that maybe they didn't really make each other better. There's something so real in this relationship by how they loved and supported each other, but it was so flawed. [It's almost as if their love ruined them. If they hadn't been willing to overlook so many problems in the name of love, they would have been better off. I kept waiting for the conversation about tinnitus. Maybe that's a scripting problem, but I think it's reflective of him wanting her to take her moment and not wanting to do anything but support her. Likewise, I hate that there was no talk of rehab for him before the big debacle. I know part of that is that it ruins the movie if they sort these things out, but I would like to add the tension of them fighting and disagreeing on how to handle things. With that being said, her forgiving him after the drunken bath scene was so reminiscent of how I'm sure all too many of us feel when we just want to not be fighting with the person we love most in the world anymore.](#spoiler) 

Someone else talked about the ""I Will Always Love You"" Whitney Houston moment at the end of the film, and I felt that it missed the mark, too. In a world where there's no Whitney to compare it to, I think that final song would have been amazing, but there's something in the framing of the scene that makes you think of Whitney, and the song just isn't as powerful as the one Dolly wrote, I guess, despite Gaga performing the hell out of it. Still made me cry, though lol.

But what i think I’ve realized in my life thus far (19 years), nothing is as it seems. Nothing is black and white. Life isn’t simple where you do bad things because you’re a bad person. Life hurts and sometimes not everyone can live through it. Watching Jack, all I can see is a boy whose dad literally didn’t give a fuck about him (i.e him not noticing his own son committing suicide and the fan being on the floor for SIX MONTHS) and he just wanted to be held and loved. It made me realize that everything in his childhood panned him out to be the depressed alcoholic he was. But also, I feel for his dad because maybe he was neglected and abused by his. And the cycle just continues. It happens in life all the time and it makes me mad that I can’t get angry at people but it’s like I understand why they act the way they do. I know for a fact if he wasn’t neglected like that as a child, it would’ve been different for him. Yea, it’s obviously is a movie but it applies to so many real life situations. 

But all in all, I think the biggest lesson I’ve learned in life is that nothing is ever what it seems and it sucks ass.",9li7w0

I'll admit though, I didn't cry, because I was *so angry* with Jack.  The chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga was so damn good, I wanted their happy ending so fucking bad.  When I realized what was going to happen, I got so damn angry.  This is not a negative jab at the film, I was so mad because the film does such a wonderful job in making you feel invested in these two.

In the beginning, I was getting worried cuz it was feeling.....not slow, but....safe? It felt like a safe story for Cooper to test out directing on.

e77ddzh,"I went in with zero expectations since I'm used to Gaga being overhyped during every release of hers. And WOW. Did not expect her acting to be as good as it was. I wasn't a fan of her acting in AHS, it felt too contrived and ""Gaga-esque"" to me, but she does a stellar job in portraying Ally as someone entirely different from Lady Gaga. None of her lines felt contrived or forced and you can tell she has been working on emoting properly, as opposed to her character in AHS. 

The only time I get hit in the head with ""Oh, that's Gaga"" is the scenes where she performs in front of an audience and you're reminded of how much talent can possibly fit into a small human.
Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his life and I just want him to start a band and sing in front my porch, because that voice was made for country.


The ballads featured in the movies are good and made better by Gaga singing them. However, the pop songs are divine. Heal me and Hair Body Face is two instant favorites of mine and I reckon they will become fan favorites. The soundtrack goes off and will pull in people of all ages. Seeing and hearing Gaga sing together with Bradley is one of the big enjoyments of this movie. I'm excited to see if they will perform the soundtrack live together outside the movie. 


My only concern, although small one, was the editing and pacing of some scenes. I felt like some scenes were cut short and wouldn't have minded if they were longer. Which is ironic considering the Blind Item reports about the pacing being ""too slow"".

All in all, this is a career high point for Gaga and Bradley. I can see this movie winning Best Picture and Original Song. I think both their performances deserves at least a nomination in the category ""Best actor/actress"" but I have a hard time seeing The Academy snub Viola Davis and Glenn Close. Gaga is in a very competitive field this year. 

Go and see this movie even if you aren't a Gaga fan. You will not regret it.",9li7w0
e77eh7t,"This is such a surprising 10/10, I went into it expecting a cute love story with a couple of nice songs attached but I came out the other end an emotional wreck. The ending turned this from a great film to one of my favourite of all time!

I can't think of a film I've seen in a long time that had me feeling such a range of emotions. I think anyone who goes to watch the film who's been affected by any of the issues in the film will really empathise with the characters.

I thought all the pre-movie hype around this film might have just been that, but after seeing it I can say it's 100% justified and I can see this film smashing most of the awards it's nominated for. ",9li7w0
e799hu7,"Remember months ago when this film was the biggest ""What the fuck kinda bullshit pet project is this remaking A Star is Born for the 4th time with Bradley Cooper directing and roles played by Andrew Dice Clay and Dave Chappelle?""

I'm glad this movie surpassed all my expectations. Beautiful film. It definitely had that concert movie feel from time to time but the reality and emotion hit every point. Cooper was delivering it, mostly cause I think it's really easy to play an alcoholic character too far, but he nailed his constant fight with depression. Gaga is the fucking star here, she was incredible as her character growed throughout the movie. Her songs in particular ""Shallow,"" ""Always Remember Us This Way,"" and ""I'll Never Love Again"" gave me goosebumps. This movie is gonna get La La Land levels of nominations for sure. 

Couple of Complaints:

*The side characters didn't get enough attention, especially Sam Elliott. He only had seven scenes at most? Dave Chappelle has two scenes and Diceman has like five. Felt like there could have been a lot more character/story motivation with them at play. The only side character who I thought got enough screen time was Ally's best friend. 

*Lots of the conflict comes really suddenly like when the cop got punched, Sam Neill got punched, or when Gaga/Cooper would get in arguments. There could have been more build up.

*So I get why the song ""Why Did You Do That?"" is there to cause a divide between Ally and Jackson, but that feels kinda forced. It doesn't feel that common for music stars these days to have these sudden genre shifts in like under the course of what felt like 6 months at most. Ally becomes an overnight sensation being a soulful singer blues/country/rock singer working with a guy who fills arenas. Then the manager goes ""You know what would make you popular? Doing a booty jam/trap song with melodic vocals."" Felt like a gigantic jump from the core of the songs in the mix that I will probably skip anytime I listen to this soundtrack. (I think every other song is good-to-great)

9/10. See this movie, weep, and love it. ",9li7w0
e79cqng,"Pretty fucking fantastic. Ending cemented it for me. I get why some people might not like it. It has every cliche in the book. The story has been told a million times, and will continue be told. But it ain’t the story you tell, it’s how you tell it. My wife and I loved it. ",9li7w0

e7cigyx,"I often find that love stories are over dramatized but it was not the case in this film.   I never felt like their relationship was over the top but instead perfectly balanced without making it seem unrealistic.  Though I expected the concept of fame to play a larger role it never outshined their relationship and its respective struggles.  Seeing Ally's rapid ascend to fame in contrast to Jack's progressive decline was exceptional.  In key scenes such as when Ally was performing at SNL (which is a big deal) it was outshined by Jack reuniting with his brother.  The movie was so much more about their relationships rather than their fame.  

The ending was terrific.  I appreciated the fact that suicide was not idolized.  Ally dying her hair back to its original color and toning down her outfits to perform the song Jack wrote (which was essentially a suicide note) brought me back to when they sang ""Shallow"".  For most of the second part of the movie, Ally's songs lacked depth (aka they were pretty Shallow) which obviously affected Jack as he felt he had failed her.  The last scene gave me the impression that Ally would never perform the way others wanted her to but rather sing songs which had depth and meaning.  ",9li7w0

So a movie about country rock with Lady Gaga shouldn't be ""my cup of tea"", but it was really good. They both can sing (I knew that of Gaga already) and the songs perfectly fit the movie. Bradley Cooper is one talented guy - writer, director, composer, singer, actor? Gaga was really good in this, and I really prefer her natural look than her glamorous pop star look.

EDIT to add: One thing I really liked was Ally's reaction when she saw Jackson at the rehab center after the awards fiasco, it really nailed how much she cared about him. Just happy to see him and support him so that he can fight his alcoholism. Really touching show of support. ",9li7w0

I had an idea of an alternate ending where Jackson comes back from rehab and plays Ally his hidden song..but as he is getting close to the end...his hearing goes completely out and he can't figure out what's wrong. The doctors tell them that his hearing is gone for good and Jackson will never be able to hear music (something he treasures above all else) or Ally sing. The movie could end with Ally going onstage and the crowd roaring for her as she sings. Then we see Jackson watching her but the roaring fades to nothing.

The  problem is that anything that doesn't feature a car chase and two explosions is hailed as a masterpiece these days.

But there's too much lacking in A Star is Born to make it a little more than a decently written emotional roller-coaster with a fairly decent soundtrack.

Also, Ally's transition from nobody to global superstar happens way too quickly to make it believable. This is a Pygmalion / My Fair Lady type of movie, a bit more effort on Gaga's part (yeah, we need a montage!) would have looked more realistic. 

I give it 6/10 and honestly see why despite all the nominations it didn't get as many awards as expected.

I’m pretty good at picking up on foreshadowing too so I noticed stuff pretty early

This movie broke me down as a man and I just need to express the key points of such a good movie.

When Jack is literally spiraling out of control and pisses himself in front of millions of people and almost ruins Ally’s Grammy and her career.. she still loved him. You could just tell. It was unconditional and I felt why Jack did what he did.

After rehab when he confessed to his brother that he idolized him and not his dad. As Bobby was backing out fighting tears so was I because of how close me and my brother are.

After the manager left and she comes in to tell Jack she cancelled the European tour. They did that thing where she traces her nose and I could feel something bad was gonna happen.. then when he put the steak down for his dog I knew.. it broke me because I love animals.. and then it just keeps going. Where he hunt himself and Charley is sitting in front of the garage waiting on his dad.

The part that killed me though.. when she is singing his song. And the edit cuts over to him singing to her and she’s crying and I just couldn’t...

e76zwkn,"Repost from other thread:

Saw an advanced screening here in the US. I saw this 1976 version, boyfriend had never seen it before and expected a chick film.

We both loved it. It was heartfelt and surprisingly funny. We are both actually alcoholics in recovery, and over the past two years I have remained sober while he has not. The struggle of Ally felt too real - I can feel Bradley’s stamp on this as someone who is also in recovery. The anger and frustration and fear you feel with a loved one who is suffering like that.  I found myself frustrated with the audience In my theater - they laughed at Jackson’s Grammy meltdown, whereas I stared at the ground with a mixture of embarrassment and shame. It wasn’t funny at all. Jackson Maine’s pure heart ripped me up. You can buy how much he loved her even when he was frustrated with her. Damn was he good in this.

Bradley Cooper’s direction was amazing. I loved the touches of filming from backstage, the ringing of the tinnitus, the close ups. One thing I felt was missing - Ally knew the direction her career was going in was ridiculous, right?

The scene with the dog and the steak...it was at that point I knew how they would handle the death in this film and I burst into tears, and cried all the way through the end. When the lights came up, I was a bit miffed at my boyfriends lack of comfort, if you will, until I saw him. It was apparent he had been crying pretty hard as well.

The music was absolutely phenomenal. I had been told that “I’ll Never Love Again” was Gaga’s “I Will Always Love You” and that was bang-on. Bradley Cooper has a wonderful country-rocker voice - I’d buy his album! I can’t wait till this soundtrack releases.

Also, as someone who has never seen the other versions of the film, does it follow the same storyline where she starts doing music but not her original sound (aka the SNL performance), etc?

Bradley Cooper is the real deal. I’ve liked him in stuff, and I’ve loved a few of his movies, but never because of him. He was great in this. That he directed it, too, is just amazing for a first time out. He’ll be nominated for Oscars for acting and directing and he’ll deserve the nominations. 

Lady Gaga is also the real deal. She can act and she can sing (not a surprise for the latter). I can’t wait to see if she pursues acting. She wasn’t as good (at singing) as Judy Garland but no one is or ever will be.

What happened with the pacing and editing? Ally went from being a shy singer to a Grammy and SNL performer in roughly 30 minutes of movie time. What they did to Jack's character was absolutely ridiculous. From the moment he proposes to Ally this movie becomes a horrible mix of a lifetime movie and a VH1 Behind the Music. 

Really a tale of two movies. Maybe it should have been a Netflix/HBO show where they could better build the contrasting story of Ally's rise and Jack's fall. They tried to shove all of that in about 70 minutes, and it does not work. Also they wasted Dave Chappelle and Eddie Griffin. 

Despite all of this I do believe Cooper had a great future as a director.

The second stanza’s “nobody knows wait awaits for the dead” is him singing what would ultimately kind of be his own fate. 

This movie was incredible. Lady Gaga as I’m sure many know said that they would only sing live for their on scene performances, and it gives it such rigor, such character.

Everything was just so real, the conflicts between him and the people around him, how he acted and how he felt.

&#x200B;

I have been where Jack was, and I could pretty much predict the ending very early. But as the symptoms got worse and more obvious as the film goes, I still felt as difficult as him, and everything that happened just kept reminding me of what I'm dealing with right now.When his brother said it was Jack his own fault, it really means quite much to me. I struggle to live and function properly even when depression is crushing me, and every moment I'm afraid that my life is just doomed to be this hard for me. But the film tells me that I have my freedom to change my actions, and we have total control over every choices we make, and that thought offers me a little hope.

&#x200B;

I feel like this whole film is about consequences and choices. I think the film represents the reality itself very well, not only just Jack's life, but also Ally's and other people's. We could understand what leads to the end, and feel how hard it was for Jack, but at the same time the film also tells us that he had his choices every time when he picked up a glass or when he took out his drug from his pocket. It soberly tells the reality, and tells us that we have our choices and control over our choices.",9li7w0

eeiyipp,Why did Jackson give the dog a steak? Was it just to distract him?,9li7w0
eeyjpdl,"Just finished the movie. I had really high expectations from the trailers and while I enjoyed it overall there were certainly flaws that needed fixing. 

I loved the songs, cinematography and the performances delivered by both Cooper and Gaga, their chemistry was certainly nice. Gaga did a great job in delivering a fleshed out character, and Cooper was definitely convincing as a fading country stud. 

I do have issues with the pacing and the plot. Pacing wise it seemed like the movie's editing was rushed. For example, the scene where Sam Elliot's character tells Cooper that he's been replaced for the Grammy performance, I was confused as to how quickly the film shifted between two scenarios, only in the previous scene had Jackson just reconciled with Ally. Another one being the switch between their rooftop moment together and a rather unnecessary cut to Ally practicing dance routines. Even the final performance, when Gaga's scene is cut erratically for a quick jump to Cooper's scene. 

The second issue is slightly bigger than just editing mishaps. For the entire first half of the film Jackson seems like a major successful star. Though he's an alcohol, he's continuously on the road, filling out stadiums and being followed by an entourage everywhere. In the second half, be immediately turns into a has-been, and the alcoholism shoots up suddenly too. The shift happens in the snap of a moment (No MCU references intended). The pacing becomes rushed here onwards and as a result the movie suffers, even certain scenes that needed an additional line of dialogue or two just miss out. We never even see Jackson telling Ally about his tinnitus, which could have been a valid scene in my opinion.

Finally, the film refused to offer something new and take a risk with a different end. The idea of suicide being the only option suited the older movies, it makes a 2018 film feel outdated. An alternate ending would be Jackson visiting the concert and singing the song with Ally one last time. Then writing a letter or conversing with her, walking away from her life and letting her be the star she is meant to be, while he rides away to live by his ways of drinking, singing, and surviving his days of obscurity.

It's a really good movie overall and I'll definitely watch it again, but these glaring issues will perhaps prevent from becoming an all time favourite of mine.",9li7w0

e7nwp5f,"As a yearlong Movie pass holder, I've seen way too many movies this year. I know that we are just getting started with worthwhile films. So it's not saying much but THIS is the best picture SO FAR. I say so far because we have 3 months to go. Also I haven't seen a nomination worthy film yet. I think this get's nominated for everything across the board and has the best shot at Best Original Song. It might win some Golden Globes but Hollywood has a hard time giving Oscars out to first timers, even though Gaga was pretty fucking good. Cooper really really brought his A game. And I agree with most on here except on a couple points that I want to clarify. I agree that the timeline seems to move at a fast pace, but that's how the other versions moved as well. Also, Cooper's character had Tinnitus in his ear. His choice to commit suicide had almost nothing to do with his career downslide. It had to do with his concluding that because of the Tinnitus (which can drive some people insane) he'll never get off drugs and alcohol. That fact makes Gaga's manager's words true and when Alley comes in to tell him she is cancelling her tour, he knows what he has to do. He does it for HER, not because he's jealous. He's attempted suicide before, his character's history does not make this choice a shock, as many have claimed. Also, in all the other previous versions of A Star Is Born, the male lead dies at the end. So cmon. 

The reason I don't think it will WIN all the Oscar's is because the pacing does feel rushed at times, and the second half of the movie is darker, obviously than the exhilarating first half. Which takes the viewer on a ""backwards"" emotional rollercoaster that most movie goers don't expect. I do feel it should be nominated across the board tho. ",9li7w0

* The opening scene of Cooper singing and shredding the guitar was so dope
* The first song where Cooper brings out Gaga and they tear the house down...wooo...emotional! She's going through this ""holy shit what's happening right now"" AS SHE'S HITTING CRAZY NOTES
* The two biggest parts I didn't like was them turning Ally into a pop star, I wish they made her a country star and had her be like a female version of him. And it was definitely 15 or so mins too long.
* Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting, Best Score are all shoe in nominations IMO.
* When Cooper carries Charlie into the house and Charlie has this happy doofy look on him and Gaga is watching them play, so heartfelt.

The use of silence struck me too.  For a movie built around songs, there are long drawn out scenes that had authentic feeling acting carried by the effective use of silence in the film.

My only real criticisms are an obscure timeline, Little backstory to flesh out our main characters, pacing in the third act, and an alcoholic being physically fit (we see Cooper’s body a few times in this movie and I thought he should have put on some weight around his midsection and neck  for believability).

Overall, this will be a film I watch again and may end up buying.  The trailers made me think this was going to be more of an upbeat movie and I appreciate so much more that it dealt with addiction at its core.

That said.... CHILLS! that moment when she says fuck it and hops on a plane only to be surprised into performing a song she half-wrote in a parking lot! Gaga killed it and so did Cooper.

The bath tub fight scene was probably the best non-singing scene imo. He wasn't saying she *was* ugly, rather the industry and what she had become is ugly. Her entire outsides and even some of her insides changed so much after the record deal. She became what she didnt want and hated a bit. She punched a cop because she couldn't stand the celebrity idealization.

Second favorite non-music scene - his dad/brother driving him home from rehab. (Though I found it funny he didn't already know where he lived.) Then when Jack says he actually idolized his brother and snuck away... as a brother that scene was beautiful.

""Ally"" (Lady Gaga)'s pop-star transformation was unexpected for me and a little disappointing? It just didn't feel right, as the whole time she's really conflicted with staying true to herself. Reminds me of a gender-reverse of the La La Land plot. Lady Gaga did really well. I just want to say that. Given her background, it was impressive what she pulled off, even though at times she gave off an ""attempting actress"" vibe. Bradley really stole the show and his performance was my favorite. I don't know how I really feel about it. It was sad and really depressing. I do want more things like this, the slow and somewhat realistic pace of storytelling.

So I had no expectations of Lady Gaga. When she sang I was in awe. What a voice. Her natural beauty shines through also. I could see she is a pretty woman. The chemistry was great. The ending I didn’t like. The part with the manager made me angry and I would have thought Jack would have punched him.  The ending of the 70s movie was so powerful to me. The final song Barbra sang was so emotional. Maybe in time I will feel that way about this movie. I think they did an excellent job remaking this movie.

The music was good, the acting was good, but the plot and flow of film were all over the place. It felt like it was told in flashbacks. They couldn't even let Gaga's final song run through without cutting in with an abrupt flashback to when Jack was singing that song. Like the plot was constantly  racing to keep up with the film. There were so many opportunities where a simple throw-away line could provide some insight into the time scale of the movie, and more importantly, how the characters feel. I also feel like Ally did nothing to help Jack out of his addiction, and at the end never really gets the deserved flak for focusing on her career while her husband spiraled out of control. I felt the message of the film was almost ""sometimes people are too alcoholic to save."" And while that may be a true statement, I don't think it's a story or message worth spreading.

Cooper seemed like a mix of Creed/Nickleback/Daughtry type, which is a much tamer version of a rockstar than decades past.


Because I read a story on T.I. saving people from suicide the other day I found out about how much the lead singer of Creed was struggling with addition and suicide attempts. This is behavior that I didn't attribute to those type of rock stars because they don't exhibit colorful behavior like Axl Rose or Steven Tyler did. So had I not read that story about Scott Stapp, the struggles with Coopers character would have felt forced to me.


With Gaga's ""instant"" rise I am glad they included the viral youtube piece. In today's environment viral has the ability to translate to success, Cardi B is the perfect fucking example. She didn't even *start* music until 2015, after her first single made it to the charts she opened the MTV music awards, and now she is winning Grammys and shit.

I'm not sure if I truly disagree with the ending and think he didn't need to kill himself for their to be the same message, or if I personally don't want to see a movie with no upside (no matter how small.)  I understand the preceding movies all saw the death of the leading man, but this movie felt like it could have been (nearly) as bleak without a suicide, and given us some shred of hope.  And the hope is not the fact that she has something to sing about.

Other than that, do people see this as a precautionary tale of how being a part of Hollywood isn't what it's cracked up to be?

There is a scene at the very beginning after Cooper performs and is in the car, there's a  close-up shot of him and a billboard in the background with nooses on them.

This movie had to have this ending, if it wouldn't end like this, it wouldn't be this good of a movie I guess.

And Lady Gaga absolutely sent shivers down my spine when she sang. I know she's talented and she really proves this in this movie. Bradley Cooper ain't bad himself! Props to him practicing his singing and guitar skills every day for a year, this shows him being really dedicated to this movie.

efn6p1n,"First off I'll say that I'm in the music business.  I'm a producer and songwriter living in LA, and I've had the privilege to be in the room with some very big artists and experience what stardom is like for them.  So I'm probably a harsher critic of a movie like this than some.

For me, A Star Is Born left me feeling confused, as some others in this thread have said.  Many aspects of the storyline are cliche.  The decision to have Jackson commit suicide was a BOLD choice, which I applaud.  But honestly, in the end, just left me feeling more depressed than inspired or moved, even through the final number with Gaga.  I think it was really in poor taste, and took the movie to a much darker place than it really should have gone.  It completely overshadows any positive lasting message that could've come from this movie.

The most cliche aspect of this movie is the age-old musical debate between ""real music"" and ""fake industry shit.""   Like an artist with dancers, trap hi-hats, and a more commercial image can't be just as much of an artist as a folky, bluesy gravelly-voiced dude with just a guitar and a band.  BOTH can be artistic.  BOTH can have truth and realness.  And BOTH can be just as shallow and meaningless if not executed right.  I'm personally tired of the narrative that ""real music has real instruments and truth and blah blah blah.""

Gaga is struggling with this question right now in her personal life, trying to turn away from what she views as the ""fake"" ""pop-star"" image that made her famous.  But the truth is her best work came when she WAS a gutsy, edgy pop star.

I think the most uninspiring aspect of the film is that we have Jackson, a supposedly ""true artist"" who's being overshadowed by Ally and being forgotten by the business, who is really just a self-destructive, unhealthy, drug-addicted wreck.  And instead of seeing some kind of redemption story for him, some glimpse into the hard-working, dedicated person he would've had to be to make it in the first place, we're left with a message of, ""Oh fuck the world... Just give up and kill yourself.""  This does not endear me to the character.  As someone grinding in the music business right now, I know that it takes a lot of hard work, tenacity, and the ability to get past bad habits that can be holding you back, and refocus on what's important.

The movie ends up glorifying the destructive aspects of Jackson as an artist, and leaving us with no real lasting message, in my opinion.  Giving up is not admirable.  It undermines the whole premise of the character; someone who overcame some difficult obstacles and learned to channel himself through his music.  We're left with a man who was just weak and broken, and simply gave up.

Ally's search for ""herself"" and her truth really just ends up being ""I have to either follow Jackson's way, or Rez's way.""  She's not really finding truth in herself at all, or making her own way.  Every major thing that happens to her comes as a result of someone else taking her by the hand and making it happen.  You could view the end number, where she's now abandoned the pop star image and is just singing on the stage with all real musicians and all that, as evidence that she's found her own way now, and I sense that's what they were going for.  But it just doesn't hit home.  She's still just singing Jackson's song, and thinking about losing him.  Again, the choice to have Jackson commit suicide just overshadows any positive triumphant moment that could've happened in the end.

The hype was real on this one, and I don't feel it lived up to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: A couple of production gripes.  Very hard to hear much of the dialogue, and a lot of major character backstory revelations and plot developments were unintelligible and difficult to understand.  The biggest revelations were often presented in the most awkward, off-beat ways.  A great example is the scene where Jackson punches Bobby over the sale of their dad's ranch.  Lots of information is revealed here, but I missed half of it or misunderstood it.

Way too many closeups.  We go from scene to scene with just closeup, closeup, closeup.  It ends up being very fatiguing.  This is a problem with many films today, not mixing in enough different kinds of shots to keep the eyes interested.",9li7w0

e7fh7x1,"I really enjoyed it, but there is a major thing here that bothers me.

It feels like a major message of the movie was to make sure you have something to say. And when you have the ability to share that with millions of people, to not miss that opportunity to make it count. Jack reinforced that lesson like 4 separate times. Sometimes in a touching moment of being very real with Ally, or being a drunk tool about it while she was in the bath. Ally herself constantly resisted her manager trying to say she wanted to be herself, and make sure what she had to share meant something.

But after Jack opened the door, she found success through really mainstream, boring sellout shit. What happened? Why was their no moment where she realized she had lost touch, and came back around? Was her dying her hair back at the end and singing Jack's song supposed to be that moment? I don't think that counts, because they weren't even her own words. I guess that gives some minor closure to Jack's story, but not her own.",9li7w0
e7onf11,"Just watched for a 2nd time, but this time online. . Man this movie really destroys me emotionally. I’ve  dealt with depression and drinking problems as well as a mother who committed suicide and I’ve thought about it often. This movie doesn’t connect with some people, I get it, but if you’ve ever felt anything like this it just feels all too real. When I saw the movie in theatre I tried hard not to cry, but watching at home all those tears flowed and it wasn’t pretty for the last 20 minutes of the movie. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had the same conversation about my mother that Sam Elliot and Ally have about Jack being the reason he did that to himself. 

Some people may have problems with parts of this movie, imo it seems like they’re missing context and what Bradley was trying to do (watch their press and it’ll make more sense), but I hope this movie is rewarded come Oscar time because we need more movies made that connect with audiences personally.. rather than 100 comic movies or movies about fucking a fish.

e7v2rex,"Went to this last night. 9/10 for me. The subject matter it handles from the traps of fame, alcoholism, depression. Fame must suck.

This is Cooper's best ever performance, lock it in for the Oscar. As a rookie actress Lady Gaga knocked it out the park, lock her in too. 
As good as I thought the shallow song was when it was released in the context nof the movie its way more powerful, lock that song in for the Oscars too. There's a lot of meta references which I loved; Sam Elliott saying you stole my voice - Cooper's accent is based on Sam; Gaga's nose - we all know the history there. 
I'm dropping 1 point for the following:
The blatant foreshadowing,
The complete emotional manipulation that this movie is. I hate emotional manipulation. 
And also the encore scene; what kind of artist does an encore where the fans want to hear the biggest tunes of your career and he gets a complete unknown to sing an unreleased and never heard before song?
Other than that, the hype is real with this one. I might go again I think it's that good.",9li7w0

e7aowq9,"I want to point out something that really made this wonderful movie a much more satisfying experience for me. In the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSbzyEJ8X9E) there were a lot of things that made it seem like maybe this would be a bit cheesy in the acting department. First is at 1:06 with Gaga raising her eyebrows in a way that seemed as cliche as her knowing smirk at 1:15. And then there was the reaction of the guy behind her at 1:30 (who turns out to be her friend) who is presumably an enthusiastic stagehand that played as really hokey. 

&#x200B;

And then BAM. All of these preconceived notions I anticipated going in were subverted, and done so in ways that made a really well placed, well paced production all around. Everything is balanced and works without leaning too much into melodrama. Unbelievable movie and I am so glad I didn't know the ending going in. 

&#x200B;

That being said, once the title card appeared, it occurred to me that maybe the title itself was analogous to a literal star dying and, in turn, leading to the creation of a new one. I don't know Jack about space but it was just a quickly forgotten hunch. I never expected to be writing a post this long in response to anything but I just really want to emphasize how much I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, as well as the importance of keeping an open mind with limited expectations going into films.",9li7w0
e774d4m,"First off, if you have the option please go see this in Dolby Atmos. The sound is incredible and my seat was actually vibrating from it at a few points.

Overall, I thought this was really good. Cooper and Gaga deserve Oscar noms for sure and Cooper's direction was great. The music was excellent and I really loved how well the film portrayed alcoholism and drug abuse. The scene where Jackson got up on stage drunk at the awards show would have been played for laughs in any other movie, but here it was sad and depressing to see. 

The big issue that kept this from being as great as I wanted to is that the pacing really suffers in the 2nd act and I never felt like the relationship was as developed as it could have been which failed to make it have as big as an emotional impact as I was hoping for in the end. 15 minutes could have easily been trimmed. 

I also kind of wished I had known there was going to be a suicide scene towards the end as I've been having a really rough time right now and struggling and that was really tough to watch. 

With all that said, great movie that will certianly get a lot of nominations with awards season right around the corner. Not quite as great as some of the hype has suggested imo, but deff worth seeing in theaters.

Maybe it concentrated too much on showing Jack drinking, we get it he drinks too much.  While Ally's career and their romance go from 0-100 in what seems the blink of an eye.

The ending was indeed tragic because of the nature of the leads' relationship. Jackson and Ally were not just a couple off-stage but on it as well. Honestly, seeing Ally ""sell out"" was not surprising in the least. She works for the music business, which would exploit an artist to the most profitable market. Instead, the most unexpected aspect was how Jackson's alcoholism and drug addiction nearly brought down both of them. Some scenes can be difficult to watch. Bradley Cooper directed this movie well. Stefani has acted before, yes, but Cooper may have given her a path to the Best Actress category of several awards. What gave this movie the extra pizzazz is the talent behind the supporting characters and cameos. When was the last time you saw Eddie Griffin on the big screen?

•We get the gist that Jack was basically raised by a father that wasn't really coherently there and an older brother who was partially there, but they hinted that he was his father's drinking buddy by the time he was 13 years old. I wondered about that dynamic. 

•Did Ally lie about going to tour in Europe? That didn't seem confirmed to me and it's such an obvious thing that she wouldn't be able to hide. 

•Did anyone else think Ally's manager had a weird history with Jack? Like he remembered the year he went to Europe and called him out and said were not exactly friends. It could have been nothing, but it felt like he resented him for something besides his defensiveness for Ally.

Also there were a lot of scenes involving being in bed. The second night they are together, Jack is passed out in bed, wakes up, Ally is there, and they start their physical relationship. The last time they are together they are prone in bed, talking. When Jack comes to find Ally she is in the fetal position in her own bed. When Ally goes to find Jack at Dave Chapelle’s house Jack is in Dave Chapelle’s daughter’s bottom bunk bed — both key pivotal moments. 

Also wasn’t it a little creepy when Jack smeared Ally’s face with food? Personally, I would not have taken that well. It might be a deal breaker, even. Then they smeared each other’s faces with food at their wedding. That seemed repetitive, too. 

And — if he was an auto mechanic her Dad and her friend would never have let him anywhere near her — and she wouldn’t have given him the time of day. He was an unwashed, slightly smarmy drunk. That bothered me. His fame was the flame they were all drawn to.

Her style didn't make her story any less valid or strong.  It was Jack's insecurities coupled with his fear of losing her that he struggled with (on top of his addiction  and growing deafness).

e7819qv,"While it didn't break any new ground including the past iterations of this story, it's a well-done movie that really captures a tragic love story and the power of music.  
  
Bradley Cooper, the Director did a great job. For a guy essentially doing his first movie and it probably involved a lot of logistical difficulties and also learning how to sing for his acting performance. It looks well done and he really nails the tone of the story and smartly surrounded himself with a great crew.  
  
Bradley Cooper, the actor did an amazing job. He really nails the character and making it is own compared to the past iterations. Jackson is a good man but a good man with a lot of personal and physical demons and unable to come to terms despite his love for Ally and his wanting her to be the person she is. I really appreciated they didn't make it a jealously/resentment story with them, he clearly loves her and wants nothing for the best with her. His problem was he couldn't get over his own demons to reach Ally about the path she was taking. Also his scenes with Sam Elliott also great storytelling between two brothers trying to get past their resentments of each other who really love each other.
  
TBH, I wasn't sure even with the great trailers that Lady Gaga could pull off the actual acting coming off seeing her in that season of American Horror Story. But she really did amazing especially the vulnerability and naivety of stardom that Ally had. Definitely award consideration worthy especially with Cooper and I think in terms of original song, that Oscar is hers. My only concern for her if she chooses to go the acting path further, Ally has some bits of her that were clearly pulled from her real life which probably was easier for her to work with, I don't know where she goes from here.   
  
I really love the use of foreshadowing in the movie, even with some being right on the nose though it's still heavy when it does especially with the nooses, the song lyrics, Ally's hair changing back and her stage name now being Ally Maine at the end. I also had that looming sense of dread the last time Jack said ""I just wanted to look at you one more time"" as a callback to before because I think in both cases, he wasn't sure if he would see her again.

e8t654m,"Just some thoughts:

\-Cooper's acting was the standout feature of the film, he should get a Best Actor Nomination. His direction was impressive for a debut but really shouldn't get a director nom, as there were issues with pacing and tone.

\-Gaga was better than expected but I think she is being very overrated here. Her line readings were unnatural at times and a couple scenes felt forced. There is no way she should win Best Actress, that would be insulting, especially to Glenn Close. It reminds me of when Jennifer Hudson won an oscar, mostly due to singing a powerful song. Put her or Gaga in a non-singing role and it will be clear they are not worthy of accolades.

\-Many plot elements and characterizations were rushed and lacked depth.

\-Songs were good, except for that pop song, which I think maybe was intentionally bad...or at least very shallow.

\-Overall, it was decent but the reviews and the pre-determined oscars seem like a bit much.

e77rohm,"Gaga will get the media attention but this Bradley Cooper's film. That he was able to direct and serve as lead actor simultaneously at this high of a level is remarkable. It makes me feel like I haven't been as appreciative of his talent as I should've been.

I've been down on Gaga's acting previously, but she did well here. She still has trouble emoting fully (look at how her brow stays still during her speaking parts and compare it to how her brow looks when singing, a complete 180 in passion), but she did well keeping pace with Cooper who was phenomenal. I had a lot of thoughts, [my review](http://cinemababel.com/2018/10/05/a-star-is-born-bradley-cooper-puts-on-the-performance-of-a-lifetime-in-an-emotionally-powerful-film/) ended up being 1500 words lol

e7gw2hq,The first time in my life that I went to the cinema and people clapped at the end of the movie. All of them. So emotional and I had to cry a few times. Well done! Still processing everything and really want to watch it again. ,9li7w0
e774zen,"Wow, really enjoyed this movie. Haven't seen any of the previous versions though so I came into this fresh. Great acting by the two leads, I spent the first half crying over Gaga and being starstruck but by halfway through I actually saw her less as Gaga and just as Ally. Cooper and Gaga had so much chemistry together and the dialogue felt very authentic (""nice socks"").


The first section was super eventful in pacing, Halfway through it just... felt kinda weird for a bit? A lot slower and dragged a bit, the end was more interesting and picked up a bit though with the drama. When I saw the ending section [after Jackson killed himself](#spoiler) i didn't know how they were gonna end it, and while it ended as best as it could as a movie I was definitely not satisfied with how it ended off (not just because [it's not a happy ending](#spoiler), I can't put my finger on it though.)

 I think Cooper and his brother story line didn't really go deep and was kinda a waste especially with the tinnitus piece too since it [mostly just focused on his alcoholism](#spoiler). Oh and Dave Chappelle just kinda being there for a bit I guess and then never coming back. 


I found it also really interesting how they molded a lot of it to Gaga's life, starting in drag clubs (YESSS MISS SHANGIE AND WILLAM WOOOO), the uber italian dad, getting signed to Interscope even (and who could forget ""i don't wanna dye my hair blonde, i don't fucking wanna be a blonde""). As an aside, I did not like the orange as a long term hair colour, the brown was definitely better. Oooooh once I saw the orange hair with that ""blue and polka dot dress""--no thanks.  However the story is still dominated by Cooper, a lot of the early-mid section Ally is kinda just.... there. 

Loved the music though aside from the pop songs funnily enough as a Gaga stan. Cooper can definitely sing, which is great compared to for example, Emma Watson in Beauty in the Beast where I found the editing of her voice took me out of it. 

My favourite scenes were probably La Vie En Rose, the first playing of Shallow, or the [the Grammy's and the aftermath when Gaga's dad and friend were dragging him in, hearing Gaga go ""that's my job!"" actually shook me to the core.](#spoiler) 

In my theatre showing on the opening night, it was 90% old people 50+ who seemed to really enjoy it and surprisingly only 10% being younger women and guys on their own who seemed to be fans of Gaga. 

All and all, if you like romance and dramas then you will enjoy this. If you like Gaga you will enjoy this. A few dips here and there but overall a firm 8.9/10 I wouldn't be surprised if this snagged at least one acting Oscar and a music Oscar (I'll Never Love Again or Shallow? Hmmm).

Soundtrack was fabulous. Songs were great. I see it getting every possible music-related award.

e7nnir2,"Good movie. Not a winner at the Oscars perhaps, not sure why but I have a feeling that best song might be the only thing.

I have to say, the suicide was not a shock to me. When the manager says it out loud that he will not be able to stay sober, I knew that he would kill himself as a way to not hold back her career. At least, that is how I interpreted that. He is close to relapsing in the car and realizes that what the manager said is true. At the same time, the part which makes the scene more powerful is that it only happens due to the conversation the manager has with him.

The seed is planted in his mind that he WILL fail even if he tries to resist and, like a weed, it has taken root to the extent that he can't get the idea out of his mind. It becomes even more powerful when you realize that the story would play out differently if he had not talked to the manager at all. 

All in all, good and solid movie.  ",9li7w0

It's a classic rags-to-riches combined with plenty of opportunities for the cast to display their ACTING! I know Glenn Close has been mentioned as being the front runner but I would not be surprised at all if Lady Gaga gets the Best Actress Oscar for this (the Best Original Song Oscar is already locked up for her and her writing team). She is phenomenal and gets to do it all in this movie. Plus the headlines would just write themselves if she won.

Also not to sound mean but I seriously don’t think I understood one thing between what Cooper and Sam Elliot were saying to each other. Their mumbles and accent made it a bit tough to understand when they talked to each other, anyone else had a hard time understanding what they were saying?

Early on in the film, Jack tells Ally that his dad died when Jack was 13 years old, and later in the film at the rehab centre he tells the old man that he'd tried to commit suicide himself, at 13 years of age. Are the two implicitly related? Are they suggesting that Jack attempted suicide because his father died or did both events happen around the same time simply because both characters were deeply depressed and traumatised? 

From what I remember Jack does mention that his father was drunk out of his mind and didn't notice the gash on Jack's forehead and that the fan lay there for six months. 

Also, do you think Jack ever told Ally about his attempted suicide? Or is that something he revealed solely to the man at the rehab?",9li7w0

And of course, Lady Gaga is a revelation. This won’t be her last leading role, and there’s a good chance this isn’t the last time we see her name in the mix during prestige season either. I just hope her next acting endeavor will be with a more experienced and capable director.",9li7w0

The film is also extremely thought-provoking if you only look at Jackson Maine's character for a moment. He found himself fading out of general popularity and his drug abuse was hindering his better performance. Eventually he drugs himself to death (this is my own personal take, but I think had he not been high, he might have had the better judgement not to kill himself, but it could have also been viewed as him trying to find the courage to do so). 

In the day and age that we are in now, where actors and singers are overdosing and killing themselves left and right, this movie sends a very important message about how famous people can start to feel like they as people don't matter anymore, until they sink into nothingness.",9li7w0

Cooper was amazing, and Gaga showed flashes of greatness although I don't think she needs to practice her Oscar speech just yet.  They had wonderful chemistry together. 

I saw the 1976 version years ago, so I had some idea what was going to happen but I wasn't expecting suicide until after his conversation with his brother. I just wanted to scream ""She won't care about her career if you're dead.""",9li7w0

Gaga gives a star making performance if I've ever seen one. Raw, vulnerable and truly magnetic. This is also the best acting I've seen from Cooper, and maybe one of my favorite ""drunk"" performances of all time. I heard some complaints about his voice and ""overacting"" but I think it suits the role and movie perfectly.

Music and cinematography are also incredible. And I echo all the comments about Sam Elliot. He does so much with a very limited amount of screen-time and his character feels very developed. Minor issue is that in some scenes I couldn't really understand some of what he was saying. 

However, as impressive as this is as a directorial debut, it's still a very flawed movie. The first half is really, really strong, but the second half felt particularly disjointed and rushed and it just kind of fizzles. You never really buy into Ally's meteoric rise and transformation into Grammy-winning superstar and we never get the full scope of her trajectory or weight of her fame. Ultimately I don't think there was a great balance between her rise and Jackson's fall -- but I think that the strength of the performances are enough to look past these issues.",9li7w0

So natural.  Her singing and song-writing as always is phenomenal, but I actually felt like these songs are some of the best work she's done in years.

The ONLY thing that bugged me:  that awful orange hair (why... why?  I get not blond b/c it's too ""Gaga"" but.. why not red?  Or even black, like Katy Perry?  That Clockwork Orange color... blah).  And the outfit she wore to rehab.  Like ok, we get it, you're hammering the point - she's a different person now.

The beginning was strong and I liked their characters and thought their dynamic was very, very likable. The original songs were great. Then as soon as Ally starts working with the manager, the movie kind of fell apart for me. It got actually very boring and slow, but also the characters fell apart too. Jack was flip flopping and all over the place, and Ally was a total sellout. They stopped writing together and stopped being real with each other.

Then to have Jack TRY to get that across to her, but have her go that direction anyway...really a bummer. Yes, Ally suggested a tour that started with their duos, but that was shot down. Then that same producer that steered her away from her soul and who shot down the duo idea  was also the catalyst that drove Jack to suicide. We are left to assume that he wins and she continues as a generic, dime a dozen Jlo-Beyonce-Janet clone (which Gaga is not).

e7meygw,"Just saw it a second time (with a friend who wanted to see it). I was able to pinpoint what bothered me about the story and why this didn't quite make it a terrific film but just a very good film, albeit too long.

The tragedy of this story is her rise and his fall. Where the script failed specifically is his fall. Let me push into this a little deeper.

I thought the first hour of the film was fantastic. Loved it, thought everything was there. It peaked when she sings the encore on the piano about an hour into the movie (she's wearing white). That's also a fantastic song that will get overlooked.

So Rez the English manger shows up and gives her a path to stardom. Up until this point, Jackson is just a boozy, on the backside of his career singer with talent who is in love with Ally. But he's really not sliding. He's still touring and playing these huge shows (love that they used Coachella for the opening sequence and this mid movie sequence).

But for Jackson to slide, he has to start losing these gigs. Instead, as she starts to take off, he has to do this private corporate gig in Memphis that pays well. That might be soul crushing but it's good money. That's where I think the script made a misstep. He does get loaded and coked up which leads to the Dave Chappelle scene. Which then leads to [the marriage](#spoiler)

For me, I think the stakes needed to be higher or at least more consequential. I tried to watch the 1954 version with James Mason and Judy Garland which was on TCM this weekend. It was tough to get through. But James Mason's slide was much more evident as Judy Garland started to take off.

So what needed to happen is for Jackson to realize that he's on his way to being a has been, an after thought. It started in that direction with his jealousy and it was right there. But instead, it was ""come to Memphis"" with me which may have been a shit gig, but at least he was still relevant. Then that would have made his choice to self sabotage and get fucked up before this gig more tragic as he starts to lose it all.

I doubt this would have saved the film for me as the second half was too long. I did like the film. I wanted to like it better. Cooper and Gaga were great. But it didn't quite get there for me and I think it was due to Jackson's downfall being not quite right.",9li7w0
e78sg9s,"I know that everyone (media wise) is so focused on Gaga and her debut... but Cooper was so much better than she was. I was captivated by him. She was wonderful too, but the stand out performance was his, not hers.",9li7w0
e79vl0o,"efore I saw this, I revisited the 1976 version of “A Star is Born” which was the most recent reincarnation and it was sorta rough. This is primarily due to the fact that the film doesn’t commit to the basis of the story. It didn’t have the characterization it needed and Streisand was running circles around Kris Kristofferson who did not want to be there. For this being Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, he puts his all into both the production and his performance. Right at the opening, he outshines the other performers who have played the persona of this character in the past. Sam Elliott plays Bradley’s brother, which makes sense because he dons this deep vibrato of a voice similar to his. Hell, even Elliott points it out and it’s part of his character complex. Even when Cooper puts on a new voice, he still exhibits a wide array of emotions. He exudes immaculate talent both in front of and behind the camera.

Lady Gaga. Holy hell. Holy hell. Wrap the next Oscars up because it's over for everyone else that earns that Best Actress nomination. She picked up an Oscar nomination in 2016 for her song “Til It Happens to You”, but 2019 is her year. She has that locked, sealed, and delivered, not just for her music, but for her performance as well. This is Gaga’s first lead role in a feature film and she kills it in a natural, experienced actress kind of way. If you aren’t a “Little Monster” by now, this film will convert you. Unlike the characters that were portrayed in previous incarnations, Ally is not a manic pixie dream girl subjected to the male gaze, but she is complex and relatable. I’m not saying that other leading actresses who played this role in old incarnations were ditzy or anything, but they truly didn’t have much to them besides their end goals. 

They develop their characters and show them as dimensional people as their relationship is the carrier of this story. I would’ve never thought that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper could be paired in a feature together, but goddamnit their chemistry is amazing. When they are on screen together they are electrifying, especially when they play music together. Rest In Peace to the other nominees for Best Original Song in every award show from now on, because they don’t stand a chance in hell against their duet, “Shallow”.

Back in 2014, I was invited to a taping of Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett’s jazz concert at the Lincoln Center. It was my first concert and she just had this charismatic presence that illuminated the entire room, mostly due to her voice and her energy. Whenever she performed a song in the film, I had an out-of-body, deja vu moment and tears flowed out of me in my seat as they did when I saw her on stage. Her talent has no limits, no bounds, and she has proven that she is one of the greatest musical performers of this century. The best part is that I’m not even exaggerating. I could write an essay about her being a cultural icon, but I won’t because this film speaks for itself.

The story is pretty formulaic, side characters seem to float in and out, and I think Gaga's character kinda becomes one note (pun intended).

e7ocps2,"Loved the first act. Movie lost me towards the end. I see how everyone’s so emotionally invested in this film, but, man, I just didn’t quite get there. 

The second act is rushed and lacks the focus of the first act. I think it’s to the detriment of the film. Part of me wishes they either cut it with a time skip or approached it differently. Considering the film recovers in the third act with some really great emotional punches, the middle just weighed it down. 

That being said, this movie has some incredible highs. I Think the real scene that did it for me was the truck scene. Sam Elliott’s tears. Heart wrenching stuff. 

Also, the way dialogue was handled in this film was great. That first scene where Jack and Ally talk is just so well acted. There’s a moment where he asks her to repeat herself which is a nice touch. And you can legitimately feel how star struck she is. 

That said the lows get pretty low. The award ceremony scene was over the top. It was too much. The point was made far before he pissed himself on stage. For a film that seemed to strive for authenticity, this just felt off. Additionally, the stereotypically evil agent just felt far too one dimensional for a film with such grounded characters. 

Overall. Solid flick. I wish I wasn’t pulled out of it in the middle of the film.",9li7w0
e78ajpi,i fucking loved it,9li7w0
e7db366,"Great movie, there wasn't a bad acting performance and the direction was very well done, it gave the feel of immersion with musical performances. I'm not a fan of country like at all, but I like all the songs in this movie especially when Jackson's riffing on his guitar. Except for the pop songs, they were generic and unbearable. Which I assume was a point since it fit so well with the story.

This film is great and all, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a feature-length VH1 Behind the Music doc. Which isn't really a bad thing, it's just that as soon as Jackson went to rehab my first thought was "" well shit, there goes the chance for a happy ending, Someone going to die now. As is tradition with all great Rock stories.


Also, I don't think Jackson peeing himself on stage at the Grammys during the victory speech would derail anyone career in the times we live in. In fact I think it would do the opposite, and propel both Ally and Jackson's careers into historic stardom, seeing how they would effectively memed themselves into history.

e7bkr23,"I absolutely loved the movie. I could echo what other people have been saying but I have one main question I have been thinking about.

&#x200B;

What do you think we are to think of Ally's artistic direction?

&#x200B;

Obviously once she starts doing her own thing separate from Jack the music changes. It gets way more poppy and I would argue superficial (Jack says as much in the bathtub scene). I don't know if it was meant to be viewed as a negative direction though especially considering Lady Gaga in real life is a huge popstar who I don't think would want to put down that kind of music. At the same time her manager pushes her in this direction after we hear Jack tell her the music has to come from her soul (he tells this before she makes the poppy music).

This also made me feel no connection between Cooper and Elliot. Both of Elliot's big scenes seemed to come out of nowhere and ended before their impact could be felt.

Also found the messaging of the film strange. It seemed to really look down on the music Lady Gaga actually makes. The final song also felt super out of place. I just could not imagine Cooper's character writing it.

e7dpq90,"Overall it was a very good movie, but I’m going to be honest, it wasn’t as amazing as I was expecting. My best friend is a *huge* Lady Gaga fan and he has been excited for this movie literally all year, it’s all he could talk about, and even he didn’t think it was as amazing as he thought it would be.  

Certain parts seemed very slow and the movie seemed to drag on at times. I thought her quick rise to stardom and the way they rapidly fell in love just didn’t feel believable enough. I also feel that they didn’t fully explore how she felt about having to “sell out” for stardom, they kind of just glossed over it. They addressed his point of view about it, but not really hers in my opinion. Did anyone else have a *really* difficult time understanding some of the dialogue? I could barely understand Sam Elliott’s character, and there were also quite a few times I could hardly understand Bradley Cooper. It got to the point where I was getting pretty upset because I would have no idea what was being talked about in certain scenes. 

That aside, there were definitely a lot of noteworthy aspects of this movie. The cinematography and music were fantastic. The acting/singing was incredible from both Gaga and Cooper. They had so much chemistry. I fully went in to this movie expecting Gaga to steal the show but I think it was Cooper who truly blew me away. I thought the movie was just “good” for most of the movie, until the ending. His suicide and everything that happened after hit me like a brick and truly made the movie stand out to me. I never watched any of the previous “A Star is Born” movies so I had no idea the ending would be so tragic.

Fun facts about filming.  I go to the Coachella Music Festival every year (this year will be my ninth) and much of the performances were filmed there.  Lady Gaga headlined both weekends in 2017 and they filmed the movie in the Monday-Thursday between the two weekends.  It was super fun spotting locations I'm familiar with throughout the film.

e77ngyc,"- The billboard covered with giant nooses that fills the window behind Bradley Cooper in the very beginning of the film is probably one of the least subtle pieces of foreshadowing in a film.
- Then again, the film doesn’t really seem like it cares if it’s subtle, as everybody speaks to each other in very profound, fortune cookie inspired statements.
- There’s a lot that I did like about the film, the performances, the drag bar characters, Gaga’s family, the music, and the sound editing/mixing.
- This film seriously would’ve improved with at least 20 minutes cut out of it. Chappelle’s character completely baffled me. He says an incomprehensible monologue about life or whatever that sounds like he’s trying to recite a Dr. Seuss poem by memory and failing at it. This isn’t a knock on him, just the script, he did fine and was a fun surprise. 
- I thought it was cool how the film rarely (if ever) shows the leads performing from the audience’s perspective. It always always slightly behind them or with really close shots.
- On the other hand, I think the film failed to really make me believe that “Ally” was suddenly a grammy winning artist. In the beginning she’s so frustrated by Cooper’s loss of personal space due to his fame. But that’s never an issue for her. And she never seems to be doing interviews or deal with any negative publicity (the piss incident is more a concern on her manager than her). It just made being a famous grammy winning pop star seem really easy. Not that I’d put it on the same level as being a full-time construction worker or surgeon, but I’ve seen summer jobs that felt more demanding than her sudden career. But maybe I’m just naive to the ways of super stardom.
- Alec Baldwin and Eddie Griffin were pretty funny cameos in their brevity.
- That dog was absolutely adorable.
- The film was emotionally manipulative but it was pretty damn effective. The dog sitting in front of the garage was killer. And although the film’s larger themes didn’t really resonate with me, their acting was dynamic enough that even small parts of their character arcs, like Cooper’s struggle to connect with his wife on a casual level, away from the music business, I found to be really tragic and moving. 
- My theater was filled with people sobbing during the credits. Like all out gasping for breath between tears. Even though the movie didn’t really resonate with me, I always think it’s special when a film can provoke that much of a reaction in its audience.",9li7w0

e7bik55,"So . . . .

I thought the movie was sensational for the first 30 to 45 minutes where the love story blossoms. Specifically, it peaked when she sings the song at the piano and she's was wearing white.

Then . . .

It lost the narrative momentum Jackson started to slide and Ally started to rise. It felt long. I was not as emotionally connected in the second and third acts.

Everything else about the film worked - performance, direction, music, etc. But the story got a little away from Cooper as a filmmaker. It was a fine effort but didn't quite get all the way there for me.",9li7w0
e7t7ekf,"Despite some solid performances and an impressive soundtrack, this film simply did not work for me. Here's why...

&#x200B;

\-Bradley Cooper as a Director: B Coop did a fantastic job as Jackson Maine (no surprise there). However, as a director, he made several missteps. And his lack of experience can be seen very early in the film with some awkward tonal transitions mid scene. For example, Gaga goes from 0 to 100 in the bar with little motivation. Why would be be so defensive of someone whom she just met? Or take the scene where she starts singing randomly in the parking lot. Not only is the transition awkward, but would Maine be suspicious of someone who is showing off to him? Surely, this isn't the first time someone has shown interest in him due to his status. However, the two biggest missteps come during the third act of the film. These mistakes derail the film so much, that they deserve their own bullet points.

&#x200B;

\-The pissing scene: Why in god's green earth did this need to go this far? Maine already embarrassed Ally by stumbling on stage. There was simply no need for him to piss himself when you already achieved the same result. Maine pissing himself is awkward and laughable. I no longer took the film seriously after this moment. And once again, Cooper simply didn't need to go there. Instead of him voiding on stage, maybe a security guard or another celebrity could have prevented a clearly drunk Maine from going on stage. From there, a fight breaks out and Maine ruins Ally's big moment. Same effect, but different cause...and not entirely fucking stupid.

&#x200B;

\-The suicide cut: Holy shit, this edit was amazing. I had to hold back tears. Not from crying, but from laughing. Seriously, it took all I had not to literally laugh out loud (I'm a member of the church and don't want to ruin other people's experience). So just to recap, Ally is on stage performing and says something along the lines of, ""Now give it up for my husband, Jackson Maine!"" And the film cuts to a silent shot of Maine hanging in his garage. JESUS CHRIST. The cut was so abrupt and so heavy handed, that it was borderline comical. What little faith I had in the film after that pissing shot was immediately lost. And once again, the decision to do this was so baffling. I'm not sure if this edit is in the other three films, but even so, there's simply no need for it. The same effect could be accomplished in a way less exploitative film technique. And in regards to the suicide, it feels a bit unprompted. Granted, you don't know what's going through anyone's head when they commit suicide. However, Maine seems to be doing better when he kills himself. And given Ally's willingness to cancel her tour, the suicide feels very selfish overall. 

&#x200B;

Overstuffed yet shallow: So there's A LOT going on in this film thematically speaking. We have Ally and Maine's relationship, Maine's relationship with his brother, Maine's struggle with drugs and alcohol, Maine's career slowly fading, Ally's career progressing upwards, Ally's relationship with her father, Ally seemingly selling out while trying to stay true to herself, Maine's demons coming back to haunt him, Ally's relationship with her manager, and so on and so forth. And to be honest, it's not entirely the film's fault. There's just a lot going on in general when you tackle this subject matter. But the film feels unfocused and all over the place. I kind of wish they just focused on Ally and Jackson and that's it. Because to be honest, the whole movie feels kind of shallow. You don't really get a deep understand of Ally, Jackson, or their relationship. Why are these two people even together? 

&#x200B;

Pacing: I get that you have to suspend your believe as a movie goer, but this film asks for too much from the audience. The timeline of the film speeds up and slows down without any warning. And this is evident with Ally's career. She goes from a nobody to a Grammy award winning artist within an hour. Why go that far that fast? The same could be said with the wedding scene. Why do the proposal and the wedding in the same day? There's just no reason for it. Oh and let's not forget the time Maine brings Ally on stage to sing without any practice WHATSOEVER. That's not being helpful. That's just being a shitty person by putting someone on the spot.

&#x200B;

Inconsistencies: My last gripe with the film concern's the inconsistencies within the characters and their personalities. And Ally is the biggest culprit. She goes from being incredibly stern about Jackson's drinking to angry/hurt to loving and accepting. Jackson goes from hating his brother to admiring his brother. Bobby goes from being fed up with Maine to forgiving him. And all of these transitions just happened. They're not explained for is there any reason for them to happen. This makes the film's narrative feel clunk.

&#x200B;

Overall, I'd give this film a C+ or B-. I think Gaga was great (with the exception of a few lines) and everyone brought their A game performance wise. And like I said before, the soundtrack is breathtaking. When Gaga performs on stage, you realize that she's a true celebrity in every sense of the word. However, Cooper handles the film's story and direction like he's Maine on stage...drunk, nonsensical, and pissing himself.

The first hour is amazingly paced, but it falls apart around the halfway point.  Gaga goes from a nobody to famous in like 5 minutes and it just doesn't translate well to the viewer.  Thought they should have spent more time with Cooper in the beginning, establishing as an actual rock-star because I didn't really believe it, which made the entire plot miss the mark for me unfortunately.  Musical numbers are fantastic though.  That scene in the drag-bar is top notch.  ""La La Land"" did the whole ""my partner is getting more famous than me thing"" and made it feel much more real and impactful.

He goes outside and slowly walks to the ocean and the walks in the water slowly... it was very eerie and beautifully shot and acted. Add in Garlands acting afterwards... wow. GaGa did great but people claiming she outdid Garland are crazy.

e7jpsah,"I see several well thought out and reasonable negative reviews for this movie that are getting downvoted pretty harshly.

This movie wasn't for me. I liked the music, and the performances were okay, but the romance was contrived from the start and it prevented me from getting invested. Plus, two hours and twenty minutes feels much longer to sit through when you lose engagement 20 minutes in. It's an okay movie, but outside of the music I don't think there is much else that is memorable.",9li7w0
e7ee737,"That scene where she gets up on stage with Jack for the first time was AMAZING. It was beautiful. Romance movies should have more of that kind of thing - huge bombastic overtures of love. But I think the movie should have ended there. The rest was just disappointing. :(

At multiple points in the movie, they talk about the importance of having something to say - it's not enough to have a good voice, you gotta have something to say too. I'm struggling to think of anything this movie has to say as a whole. What does it have to say about things like alcoholism or fame? Ally's album is a huge hit - oh that's neat. Does that affect her in any way?  There's a bit where her manager asks her to dye her hair and she protests. But she does it anyway and her hair remains dyed for the rest of the movie. That could have actually gone somewhere, but there's no payoff!

There's a bunch of other weird bits in the movie that have no payoff. Jack punches his brother who quits. But he comes back anyway... oh that resolved itself I guess. Also, Jack has tinnitus... and he's going deaf. He won't do as the doctor says. But nothing happens. Does that even matter to the plot? Did we see it contribute to his alcoholism or impair his ability to perform on stage? Ehh. When Jack shows up at her dance rehearsal, it turns out he has been sober for a few days. Neat. But where was the struggle to overcome the addiction. That was an easy two months in rehab!

The first time we see Ally, she's breaking up with her boyfriend over the phone who responds by proposing to her. Jack doesn't turn up to her gig and he's in trouble. So he proposes. Is this scene supposed to callback to the earlier scene? They get married the same day. I groaned.

I did not know Lady Gaga's character's name until they showed it written on a huge billboard. This is probably just me, but if your movie stars Lady Gaga and you need to stick a billboard halfway through the movie in order for the audience to know her character's name then something is wrong!

e78y6he,"The film was good but a bit overhyped.... 

SPOILERS...

The second half was very rushed, and you cant tell the time frame it takes place in. It feels like all this is happening within a couple of days cause time just jumps in scenes. You have one scene where she's learning how to dance with her backup dancers then shortly after shes performing then on SNL then finding out she has 3 Grammy noms then a couple of minutes later is accepting the award... it was rushed. 

Also this one didn't feel as emotional to me and I don't care for how his suicide scene was done. Also, the hype for GaGa is overboard. She was good, and competent but there was nothing about her that stood out (honestly she was better in the first 2/3 than the final act). I read some comments online saying Judy Garland wish she gave as good a performance as Gaga and some critics saying she's the best actress of all the actresses to portray the female lead in the story. Its ridiculous. She was good, not great, and I felt her acting in the final act was a bit soap opera like. Cooper holds strong throughout (although crying scenes seem to be his weakness)... but he was fantastic. I felt he carried her in their scenes. 

Good movie overall but a bit rushed, a bit melodramatic and too much hype.

I guess it seemed obvious it wouldn’t work out from the start, either they’d split cuz of the alcoholism or he’d die from it (i didn’t see the suicide coming til near the end though...i thought he’d crash his bike while wasted).

Jack has these convictions about real music and I never see why. Sam Elliot reappears backstage at snl cause of one line of dialogue and its just all good.

Cause as someone whose been a cinephile his whole life it seems the latter is the trend these days. 

The film was amazing for its first act. The second and third act never lived up to the first. GaGas acting was strongest in the first act. By third act you could see her “acting” more as she felt less natural. Especially that final song where you can LITERALLY see her forcing tears and that face. It was very unnatural. Yet she’s being compared to the incredible talents that were Judy Garland and Barbara Streisand in the role?

The editing was sloppy. The directing for the second and third acts was rushed. The pacing was terrible for the second half of the film also. 

The story doesn’t have a clear message. 

People can downvote me to oblivion cause I refuse to pander to the status quo but the ridiculous over praise needs to end.

It was the most stereotypical ending about a film that deals with alcoholism, depression, and suicide. Literally wasted 2 hours to see the same story told over and over. We get it my god.

Would have rated it 9/10 had the film had a more impactful ending. The ending drops it to a 7/10. Oh and the last minute “verus (or w.e the fuck his name was)” being like “you’re trash you’re holding her back” and literally winking to the audience was so bad. They might as well have paused the film and had Bradley Cooper turn to the camera and say  “oh here’s where the stereotypical douchebag comes and acts as a literally catalyst for my characters subsequent suicide”. I couldn’t even be sad by the end because of how heavy handed this shit was. Suicide is complicated, messy, and doesn’t make sense? Oh wow what a revolutionary ending on that thought.

e776yo2,"This was a solid film. I'd give it somewhere between a 7.5/10 and an 8/10. The music was great, Lady Gaga's performance was good, and Cooper was excellent. However, I'm not sure if this story translates well to the present day. It felt like a story written in the 1930s. The relationship is abusive, but despite Ally threatening to leave him, she never does and the film doesn't seem to recognize the problems with that. And the film ends with him recovering from his addiction, her manager telling him that he will relapse and should get out of her life, and him killing himself despite being in a better condition than he's been at any other point in the movie. That's a terrible message, and it isn't one that makes much sense. I had a couple of other criticisms of the movie. First, the movie doesn't spend enough time addressing the problems with Ally becoming a vapid pop star and moves past that plotline too quickly. Second, I could barely understand half of the words Sam Elliott was saying. Overall, this movie was good, but flawed.

On a more important note than any of that, Bradley Cooper's dog is adorable and deserves to win an Oscar.

e97kfgn,"I loved this movie BUT I hated the ending and didn't see why it had to necessarily follow the previous movies.   

I’ve rewritten the whole ending in my head and think it’s much better! In my version Jackson phones Ally just as she’s about to do another live gig with her horrible pop stuff and tells her what Raz said about ruining her career. She then comes out on stage in just a simple shirt and jeans and sings one of her own nice country type songs, which goes off, instantly viral etc. Raz says wtf are you doing and she slaps him and says she knows what he said to Jackson and that he’s fired and that she’s going to have her own independent label and not sing this pop shite that isn’t her. In the meantime we see Jackson breaking down, searching house for drugs etc. Finally he calls his chauffeur and says he has to go out. In a scene that mimics the earlier scene of him looking for a bar we see them driving around and think he’s going to find booze BUT he ends up going to an AA meeting. People are shocked to see him and a couple of them scoff at his Grammar Awards fiasco. Jackson agrees it was his rock bottom and how ashamed he is. 

But then another man pipes up and says he killed his own daughter by arriving home drunk and not seeing her playing and ran her straight over, he just wanted to get inside to keep drinking and didn’t even see her. That was 20 years ago, he’s done time but will always be in prison for it. At least Jackson can make amends, and he says he would swap rock bottom with him any day of the week….Later on Ally comes home to a dark house, thinks the worse, rushes in, Jackson is in kitchen has made a candlelit dinner, he tells her he went to a meeting, she says she’s fired Raz etc and they end the movie talking about what their record label will be called. Then it’s “1 year later”, zoom in on a sign Rose Records, lovely country cottage. Big dinner party with Jackson, Ally and all their friends, she is pregnant and they’re teasing that black dude about if he can babysit when they go on tour and how successful latest record has been, finish with Jackson and Ally singing a duet…",9li7w0

e7bmxz2,"Im shocked at how much I hated this movie conisdering how much I love both Judy & Barabra. The film itself was very rushed giving barely anytime for character devlopement. Great he's a drunk, she's a good singer...and that is all we get. Why is the ""brother"" reveal set up as such a shock? Like does she not know Bobby is his brother? And we get montages of them on tour but then she sells out and becomes a pop star for some reason (and she never goes back from). The whole SNL/Grammy thing is so out there. Also they never mention this best friend in memphis before he is introduced but we are just made to assume they have a long history together... also how the fuck did she find him at a random persons house... Jackson unloads he tried to kill himself only for the fact that the story needs him to die. AND HOW DID THE DOG GET OUTSIDE. 

Overall its very fast, given little to no time to get to know characters or introduce them and expects us to care. 

Bradley isnt a director, or at least he should not have been given this movie however the music & acting (Sam was my favorite) is amazing. Im sure all will be nominated if not win for their roles. But overall i was let down. I know its an unpopular opinion but I just need a place to offload it. ",9li7w0
e778k5p,"Take what I think with a grain of salt because...does it really matter?

My only beef is that I don't feel like the film did enough with the characters to make me care for them more than I did. As high as the stakes were in racing towards the climax, and as complex as the internal conflicts of the characters were throughout the film - I feel like something was lacking in the storytelling that prevented the climax and falling actions of the plot to have a lasting, significant impact on me as an audience member. Each time a scene showed Ally and Jack's relationship development or character development, I feel like I only got the Cliffnotes summary of where each of them were as characters. I wish I had more time with Ally and/or Jack as they developed, and I wish the film made more of an effort to try and put me in one or the other's shoes. I think because of this, I didn't really find myself ""moved"" quite like I thought I should have been. I know it's hard to do more than what was done in a 2-hour timeframe, as there is a ton to unpack in these characters. But in my opinion, I think when you have stories that seem to focus heavily on complex human topics such as love and loss, it should be a TOP priority for the audience to feel like they were part of the characters' lives as much as possible. When a story is told well, you feel like you went on a journey and experienced something new you otherwise probably wouldn't have in real life. Based on what I saw, I didn't get the impression that this was a TOP priority. The film didn't make me feel involved/invested in Ally and Jack's lives enough for the climax and falling actions to have that lasting, memorable impact or human experience - and for me personally, that was a major disappointment, given all the opportunity. 

It might be that this film was not supposed to be about love and loss. It might be that the goal was to simply tell a story about a couple of singer/songwriters who fell in love at different career stages and sometimes had identity crises that led to poor actions and consequences. Maybe the creators never intended for the movie to take the audience on a deep dive explorarion of the human condition through love and loss. That's a valid artistic decision. But as serious artists, would that really make this story worth telling without that deep dive? Financially, YES. Artistically, probably not. 

Ultimately, I enjoyed the movie and had a GREAT time! It was a beautiful and tragic love story with excellent music, likable characters, good times, bad times and plenty of starpower worth briefly chatting about at brunch this weekend, but the lack of any serious artistic treatment with (what I interpreted to be) the major themes will probably have me forgetting all about Ally and Jack by next weekend. 

What I won't forget is the soundtrack! There are some great songs in the film! Also, despite my critique above, I thought Gaga and Bradley gave wonderful performances for the material they had. Having said that, Lady Gaga's rise to fame has so many loose parallels with Ally's that I don't know if Ally was much of a stretch for Gaga to play. Even though Gaga is the perfect person to cast for Ally, a LOT of Ally's character was suspiciously convenient for Gaga to ""act"" out. I thought she did a great job, but now I would be very interested to see Gaga play someone totally unlike herself.

e7fqjcf,"If you can buy into the romance, then you’ll probably appreciate the film. I couldn’t so I did not. I didn’t buy a drunk country rock singer would immediately fall for a girl he heard sing at a drag bar. It seemed rushed. And then every step of the relationship afterwards was just as rushed. Yet, for a film that was rushing, I felt every single minute of it. It was not for me, and I wanted to leave quite early.

That said, I’ve long believed that for a musical to be a success, only the music needs to work, and it did. Lots of good songs to tap your toe to.

The performances weren’t great, but they did fine. Gaga had a couple bad scenes, but was fine most of the time. Cooper was emulating Sam Eliot a little too much and more than a few times it didn’t work. Sam Eliot was too old for his role. They tried to retrofit the age difference by saying Cooper’s dad was 63 when he was born. But 20 minutes earlier Cooper said his mom was only 17 when he was born. That’s gross.

Dave Chapelle’s scenes should have been cut.

That’s all I got to say. Weak romance movie that squeaks by with a passing grade due to good music. 

Edit: Also think the movie should have focused more on Ally than Jack. You know, about the star being born. It should have been her movie, and too much attention was given to him.

Also, why did she punch that cop. Random. He was asking for a pic and Jack was okay with it...",9li7w0

Cooper and Gaga had good chemistry together, some raw emotional scenes peppered throughout the film, and I thought the songs were engaging. I was really impressed with Sam Elliot in the little time he had on screen. Based on the trailer, I thought he was going to be some dbag manager, but it was nothing of the sort. I am glad they did the trailer fakeout/switcharoo about everyone not liking how Ally looked and the line in the film made much more sense. With that said, and while she did a good job in her first big acting role, I didn't think Gaga is worthy of all the Oscar hype for acting, but Cooper delivered the goods acting wise and was believable as a star musician (kudos to him for going the extra mile to train himself into being a musician).",9li7w0

&#x200B;

Almost as if he finally faced his demons and overcame them, despite how incredibly low he was at.  It would have kept the effect of empathy and fear that the audience was holding onto, while also showing that it IS possible to work through those times.  And I am sure they could have made this reveal at the concert very emotional too as Gaga would be expecting the worst if he didn't show only to see how beautiful it was that he really is trying.

The soundtrack is great. Cooper is good, Gaga is as well but their story I guess just doesn't resonate with me specifically. Just felt a little too predictable. 

Supporting cast stole the show, drag queens, Dice, and Elliot were great. 

I felt some of the dialogue was clunky and felt like it was trying too hard to be ""natural"" that it accomplished the opposite. Also, some of the edits were really abrupt and jarring. I'm pretty sure most were stylistic but at times it kinda felt amateurish.

e7qhxtf,"As much as everyone wants to hate the manager for that anti pep talk at the end, i honestly don’t blame him. At the end of the day, his intentions are whats best for allie. At the end he realized that the best thing for allie moving forward was to have jack out of the picture. Why? Because jack was an alcoholic and the music industry cares too much about image to tolerate that. It’s the combination of jack falling ill to the disease and the value of image in the industry that killed jack. The manager wanted what was needed in order for allie to survive and nothing else, even if it meant an anti pep talk to get jack’s alcoholism out of allie’s image.  

These are fictional characters but i dont believe the manager went into the conversation with jack intending to kill him. He just wanted it to hurt so jack would back off and he could make allie’s image the best it was. But that talk was the final straw on top of jack’s disease and his own understanding of the value of image in the industry.

I was ready to walk into a rather mediocre film and was convinced this would suffer from the very common occurrence of ""director is actor vanity"" and I am so pleased it did not although some scenes did come very close to that specifically in the final moments with Bradley's character. I was pretty much expecting both Cooper and Gaga to be so into their own performances that they wouldn't be listening to each other (I had this issue with when it came to Gaga in AHS) and I am so, so, so pleased to say that neither of them had this happen to them. 

That being said: the amount of comments in this thread along the lines of ""that was the greatest use of editing I have ever seen"" and ""the cinematography was so beautiful it's the first time I've stepped outside of a movie to realize how beautiful it was"" must not see very many classic films and I can't help but roll my eyes and laugh.

The film had to have Jack go to rehab, when it is shown to not be very effective compared to medication and therapy. They could have dug deep into Jack's mental illness with the latter. If they were to show rehab, they could have really shown it, and how unscientific it really is.

My last complaint is the ""Shallow"" performance. There is no way they could pull that off without rehearsing. And Ally never even warmed up to sing. Every singer needs to warm up before performing.

As a musical, it is a step in the right direction for the genre. Many of the songs were good and didn't have a Broadway feel. I liked how when Ally would start singing her song ideas in conversation, it felt sort of realistic. ",9li7w0

1.) Ally was not a good employee at her restaurant job. Her boss tells her it is her turn to take out the trash but she tells him to get someone else to do it because she has to get to her show. This almost automatically made me dislike Ally. 
Then when her boss says she is late, it is obviously a regular thing that he is fed up with and she made him the bad guy for calling her out. I get that she was getting stalked but she could have explained that. I know I should overlook this but it bothered me about her character throughout most of the movie.
2.) That Jackson even gets someone to come to her house and wouldn't take no for an answer.
3.) I am a cashier and it irked me so much when he flicked his wrist to scan the bag of frozen peas. (I have also worked in a restaurant so Ally reminded me of certain co-workers.)

Some of my friends sympathise with him as he was concerned that Ally was sacrificing her identity as an artist to please the masses. But he had no right to intervene in her career, even attacking her identity by calling her ugly. Especially since she was insecure about her looks from the start. That's just straight up abuse.

Besides suffering from depression and addiction Jackson's career doesn't seem to fall apart as the film goes on. He's still making albums, touring, he even gets a gig on the Grammy's. He gets demoted from singing to just playing guitar though but big whoop. In the 1954 version Jack can't get any work at all, his career is pretty much over. This is where the biggest problem with the 2018 version is for me. The 2018s award scene is more funny than sad compared to the older versions and it's all cause of him pissing himself. The way Cooper leans his head back, shutting his eyes, and letting it rip made be burst into tears of laughter instead of sadness. Whereas in the 1954 version when Jack is at the award ceremony stumbling around on stage just like Cooper but instead of pissing himself he begs for work.

He could just as easily have left Ally and achieved the same desired effect; he wanted to not harm her career, to not pull her down with him. He could have left and done just that. He just wasn’t suicidal. Nothing pointed to that. 

And one agent who’s a jerk basically convinced him to off himself in one two minute conversation? Nah. It’s just way too convenient for drama’s sake. 

Aside from that, what a wonderful movie. Bradley Cooper’s acting, Gaga’s understated performance, the CHEMISTRY, the way it was edited. All of it. Just a solid, amazing, knocked out of the park movie.

The movie felt like a long commercial for Lady Gaga that entangles her true life with fiction in order to make her seem even better.  I agree about the urinating scene, over the top.  I didn't even enjoy Cooper's turn as Jackson.  His accent felt so put on that I couldn't take it seriously.  I was surprised with how well he sang, though.

&#x200B;

I think they covered up the lack of Gaga's acting by humiliating them both.  Instead of using character acting to get you to care, they basically call Ally ugly because Lady Gaga's been called ugly.  Then right after they show her naked.  So of course, you can't help but feel bad for her, but the reason is because she had to suffer humiliation in a way that probably carried past the character to the actual actress playing her.

I felt once she became a pop artist, I lost a little interest, as I felt it would of captured me more if the songs were more toned down and emotional felt, like Striesand.  I would of preferred his end to not have been so displayed, or at least chosen a different demise,  given  reminders of similar acts that have been in the news lately.

Finally, the script wants to cram all the cliche drama beats (the dog, the bad father, the bad brother, drugs, alcohol, homosexuality,etc) in 2 hours an 20 minutes and because of that, all of the most important moments from the characters felt rushed and did nothing for me.

However, I can’t help but notice that this is essentially the Hollywood version of a Bollywood film, Aashiqui 2. Same concept, drunk pop star goes to small time bar, finds girl with amazing voice, their relationship deepens, her career explodes, he struggles with alcoholism and inevitably commits suicide thinking it’ll benefit the girls life. Nothing new. ",9li7w0
e7rocaq,"http://screencrush.com/a-star-is-born-remake-problems/

eh3xozx,"This movie was shit. One-dimensional characters who never evolved, a discordant, poorly paced narrative, and shitty songs. Jackson killing himself was my favorite part because it meant the movie was nearly over.",9li7w0
e77mrg0,"Listening to the soundtrack in full, the country and rock songs are way better than the pop ones. Lady Gaga is great as a singer but it does feel a bit like a vanity project for her (ironic since her costar directed).

It’s still a good movie, but Lady Gaga’s ego can be heard in the songs she writes. ",9li7w0
e7bjz15,"*spoilers*

So ... Ally is just a terrible person, right?  

I enjoyed the movie, but that seems to be the key takeaway.  She only goes to Jack
When her boss pisses her off, she quits her job and has nowhere else to go.  She immediately falls in love with the “life style”, as captured on her trip to the concert on the private plane.    She turns a blind eye to his substance abuse.  She sells out as an artist and provides only light resistance to selling out when she refuses the dancers, but immediately walks it back when her agent scolds her.  When Jack goes to rehab, there’s an immediate distance and she doesn’t try very hard to close that gap.  She lies to Jack about canceling the European tour in an apparent attempt to get him to say, “no, do the tour.”  Finally her “tribute” to Jack seems oddly cold and devoid of emotion.

I find it hard to believe in 2018 that an A-list movie would position a male lead as a victim to a carnivorous female lead, but that’s what it felt like from my seat.  It felt as though Ally’s father was her Spirit Animal and she was delivering his revenge for the life he didn’t lead.

Probably fans of her music career cause she was great in the first act, the middle was good and then the final act was just ok. She was nothing more than doe eyed and you could see her acting as she sang the final song. Did not feel natural at all. Add the ridiculous trope of showing clips of her and Jack together to let you know you should be sad and crying takes away from the finale.

Reposting my takes from /r/TrueFilm:

I just sat through it. Pure garbage, it was predictable, lazily filmed with nothing but extreme closeups, piss poor editing and sound design. The Pacing was all over the place, oh cool Dave Chappelle is in this, wait what did he add to the movie? Songs were shallow husks of being. The whole movie was shallow. And the love story begins with what is very nearly sexual harassment. She’s clearly not into it and only sticks with him because he’s famous.

Do yourself a favor watch La Dolce vita for a better movie about fame and ego, or inside Llewelyn Davis for a better music movie. If you want a story about depression Bojack horseman does a better job.

This is a Hollywood film made for mass audience, every story beat has closure, the protagonist spends the whole time becoming a hero, she wins a fuckin Grammy on her first record. It says nothing about humanity, or the characters, it is completely unrelatable and unrealistic. Worse it’s not fun. It’s a shallow pool of modern filmmaking.

This is a deeply American film. All your dreams will come true, as long as you stick to your guns you’ll become famous, you’ll marry a guy who quips like a marvel superhero, sure the road is hard but you made it. It’s from a different era. This kind of optimism doesn’t exist in today’s American society. It feels so out of place when so many people these days are struggling with the real questions of how to exist with modest goals, without finality and closure, to take things day by day without the struggle of finding food that our monkey brains are programmed to want.

Lady Gaga did a good job acting tho.

And LCD soundsystem had one song, so it got +1 genius points for me.

Don’t waste your time.",9li7w0

Only thing this movie did for me was to introduce Bradley cooper as a singer we didn’t know. There was absolutely nothing special about it otherwise.

Yes, I think the cinematography was good especially for the concerts. When Bradley was performing, the camera was much more handheld and mobile, changing perspectives all the time and giving a chaotic feeling, like what his character was going through.

When Gaga was performing, the movements were very smooth, methodical, and almost stationary. This gave her the more level-headed feeling and it was almost comforting to watch her. 

But the cinematography on Bradley really pissed me off. There was a number of times when he would talk down and the camera would't show his face which was frustrating. I think that adding an angle of him when he's looking down so that we could see his face would have helped a lot.

>Each time they remake A Star Is Born, they weave in new elements -- some successfully, some not -- that subtly alter the story, in an attempt to tailor each version to the sensibility of its era.

>If you're familiar with a couple iterations, you can start to see their common framework -- most baldly revealed by the original, non-musical version ""What Price Hollywood?""

>Every version asks the same question: What does it take for an artist to achieve -- and sustain -- greatness? And is that a price worth paying?

>(If you take a step back and swap in ""scientist"" or ""mathematician"" or ""Apple founder/CEO"" for artist, you'll see this same question woven through any number of biopics. And the tension in each version is essentially the same: Some humans have a skill or a capacity that sets them apart from 99.999% of the species; a skill or capacity that has the potential to achieve something no one else can. But the very rareness of that skill or capacity means that almost no one will understand the lived experience of that individual, and each step they take in pursuit of developing the skill/capacity will pull them further and further away from the prosaic reality where most of us live. So much of that individual's life is spent being pulled between their common humanity and the potential to be extraordinary.)

>Jackson Maine has achieved greatness, but he's since severed himself from much of his humanity, living in a drug- and alcohol-numbed fog that keeps him from feeling the emotional highs and lows that once fueled his art. This is a thin, ephemeral version of greatness -- once an authentic artist, today he is admired by his fans for his past work, but living an isolated and unproductive life.

>Ally is fully connected to her humanity -- she's part of a community, she's a good friend and loving daughter. It's not a coincidence that we see her taking out the trash, or first see her perform in an intimate setting, moving through her audience, interacting with them. We're meant to understand from the very beginning: She's human. She's one of us.

>She's also an artist -- but one who keeps her art at arm's length. Who cannot commit herself fully to acknowledging and developing her potential. She performs an Edith Piaf cover, disguised as Piaf. She writes songs, but doesn't perform them; she's literally been told by gatekeepers that her humanity -- her normal face, her normal nose -- completely obscures the value of her art.

>Every version I've seen always begins the same way: The formerly great artist meets a woman, catches a glimpse of her potential, and is reminded for the first time in years why he originally pursued his art. He nurtures her gifts, and in so doing, bit by bit reconnects with his own humanity, until he regains his long-lost capacity to love someone more than the collected resentments, grievances and grudges that have gradually separated him from humanity.

>But as the new artist flourishes, her mentor/lover is forced to share her with her art. And as the novelty of their relationship wears off, the mentor/lover discovers he's still hip-deep in the damage done by the years of destructive, isolating behavior before he met his beloved. Sometimes that's a history of alcoholism that makes the mentor/lover unemployable. In the 2018 version, there's both hearing loss and untreated chemical addictions.

>But in every version, it means the mentor/lover is confronted by the loss of his art at the same time as his protege has grown into her abilities, has found an audience, has achieved things she could not have imagined in her old life.

>Notably, she's done it by finding a way to embrace both her art AND her humanity: Only her mentor's love for her, and her for him, have made this change possible. There's ALWAYS a moment when the mentor/lover says ""Trust me,"" and leads the new artist into the spotlight. She intuits in that moment, he loves her, he would never knowingly let her suffer** -- and so she does trust him. She steps into the spotlight and shines.

>So when the mentor/lover struggles with the loss of his art, we already know there's a path back to safety. It's the same path the artist/protege took: Embrace his humanity. Give himself over to love, even if it's imperfect. Even if it's not as glamorous or shiny as his art, or the fame that art brought him.

>And in each version of the story, the mentor/lover tries. Tries as hard as he possibly can. But he's spent too long living his life for his art, and only his art, and losing that proves to be more than he can bear. All he can see is his failure as an artist, not his potential as a loving human partner. If he isn't an artist, he's no one. With no reason to live.

>(In biopics, you more typically see the Genius so fully embrace his Extraordinary Ability that he or she achieves the Extraordinary, but is a failure as a human. The whole point of biopics is that we make them about people who fascinate us, which tend to be people who have done Extraordinary Things. However, since ordinary humans outnumber Geniuses AND watch a lot more movies than they do, most biopics shake their heads sadly at the terrible price the Genius has paid, even if unknowingly. They show the families tearfully resenting the compromises forced on them by the Genius's Extraordinary Ability, and the vast majority of the time, the Genius eventually makes amends for his failings, or dies in a state of remorse over not having been able to make amends. If someone has made a movie about a Genius where he or she ends up having compromised literally every human obligation or relationship they've ever had and does not give a shit because It Was All Worth It, I haven't seen it.)

>But I digress! So yeah, in the end the mentor/lover fails to connect with his humanity, and overcome with despair over the loss of his art, he kills himself.

>And most ASIB act threes ask the follow up question: How the fuck can the protege artist POSSIBLY survive the lost of her mentor/lover? His suicide strongly suggests that ultimately, living for one's art is not enough. Yet how can she embrace her humanity, when that's tied so inextricably to grief? To the loss of the person who love helped her grow into the artist she is today? Sometimes there's a hint that she could turn away from her own humanity, bury herself in the same isolated artists' life, represented by some soulless or shitty project she got involved with before the mentor/lover's death.

>The final scene answers that question by showing us the protege finding a way to use her art to endure the pain of being human and grieving her loss. She has come full circle. Where her humanity -- her love for her mentor and his for her -- once fueled her ability to pursue her art, now her art sustains her ability to be fully human. Judy Garland's actress character steps on stage and performs a composure she doesn't entirely feel; Lady Gaga sings; both women are channeling their grief -- their humanity -- into their art.

>We are, I think, meant to hope that this is truly the moment a star is born. That these artists will endure, their brilliant work fueled by their humanity and their humanity supported by their work. But I've never reached the credits of any version of ASIB without wondering if there's not a slight implication that the protege artist is ultimately doomed, that only by walking away from art entirely could she possibly hope to save her soul.

>** It is also not a coincidence that every version of ASIB features an intoxicated mentor/lover later publicly humiliating the protege artist on the most prominent possible stage. No, the mentor/lover would never *knowingly* let the protege suffer, but when he no longer has the distraction of her undivided love and attention, he unthinkingly returns to the old resentments and old habits, metaphorically (and sometimes literally) cheating on her with anger, self-pity and the addictions that let him pretend he's the victim in all of this -- and that infidelity is revealed at the moment the protege first tastes real acclaim. At that moment, we understand the mentor/lover's humanity has badly atrophied from his long years of living for his art; it will take real effort on his part to undo that damage.",9li7w0
e7k73bb,Bradley said in an interview that she is born a star at the drag bar. Specifically when there’s that shot of Ally looking directly at the camera. So the fact that they do the same shot at the end shows a rebirth maybe?,9li7w0
e7dombr,"Reminds me of Celine singing for her husband who past.

I attended a funeral where the man who past away’s 12 year girl sang Amazing Grace. I will never forget her courage. ",9li7w0
e7i2e8z,I was thinking it was that moment that a star was actually born. ,9li7w0
e7kzfvh,If that happens in real life that would be like the most popular moment and song and will be an instant classic. ,9li7w0
e7isc49,I think they really nailed addiction. So much shame and regret at the things you have done. A huge part of rehab is not only owning those things but apologizing to the people you have wronged. We see it later when he tells his brother (with much difficulty) that it was him he idolized and not his father.  Then the utter hopelessness he feels in regard to his own ability to change and the shame that comes with that is heartbreaking. ,9li7w0
e854oi2,And also when Ally is asking him whether he’d be going home because she didn’t know whether he’d still want to be with her once he’s sober. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper were really good at portraying the vulnerability of it all.,9li7w0
e7o7vuu,i think that was Coopers finest moment as an actor in the film......IT FELT SO DAMN REAL....first tears shed at this moment,9li7w0
e9ge8qe,"I loved that scene because he was really sorry. When he apologized for the bathroom scene, he was unable to even really say he was sorry or what he was sorry for- he just kinda mumbled about the way he acted. In rehab he was able to see exactly how he’d hurt her, admit it, and truly apologize for it.",9li7w0
eipvdv0,"I went to see this film for the second time last night and THIS scene more than anything just breaks me. 

Brings back some painful memories. Struggling with mental illness and falling for the trap of addiction and hurting everyone around you... It's so hard to communicate how that feels and so hard to say sorry. You feel you've done everything wrong. No, you ARE wrong. How do you apologize for that? Pfff. 

Superb acting by Cooper. Amazing.",9li7w0

e77auf3,"There are long two hour movies and short two hour movies. 

This was a short two hour movie. It felt like an hour and a half long movie or something I wasn't bored wondering when they are going to get to the end like with some other movies. I hope there is some extended/directors cut of the movie to give us a bit more because I would be more than happy to get a little more of so much of the movie.  ",9li7w0
e7c8wp6,I thought the pacing in this movie really fell off after Ally and Jack performed on stage for the first time. Things got better towards the end though,9li7w0
e7c7lb0,"I have the same exact thoughts! While I do enjoy a long well made film, my usual complain about most movies is that they are too long. For A Star is Born, I really became attached to the characters. The relationships and dynamics were really interesting. Not only for Jack and Ally but everyone involved. I wanted to learn more about Jacks story and Ally’s insecurities. I wanted to see her rise to fame expanded and also Jacks relationship with his brother talked about more. This movie could have easily been expanded to 2 hours and 30 minutes to really expand on the narrative. 

The crazy thing is that even though I think it was a little too short, almost every scene had a purpose and moved the story forward. It was a really jam packed film which is surprising. Some parts even felt rushed like the ending and how quickly Ally and Jack fell in love. Still, I really enjoyed the film. If anything, I think they could have had a sharper edit after the Grammy scene since what came after was a tiny bit sloppy in my opinion. But nonetheless, this film was fantastic. 

I felt like I wrote a mini review so I’ll just say I give this film a solid 9 out of 10. ",9li7w0

e79bnhz,"this is exactly what i said coming out of the theater. for a 2 hour, 17 minute film, i felt like it could have went another hour, just because of how fast it moved. it wasn’t too fast, though, where i’m just confused and overwhelmed.. just a small little nitpick if i had to have one. i’m obsessed with the movie and want to see it again.",9li7w0
e7lk2jh,Definitely. That’s so weird because I am the first one to complain when movie is too lengthy but they really could do even better with like 30-40 minutes more. ,9li7w0

e77zvyk,Ally gathering the courage to step on stage for the first time was my favorite moment of the movie. All of the behind the scenes lead up created the perfect level of intensity.,9li7w0
e78xe88,Most accurate portrayal of how men handle emotions. Both of them wanted to cry but didn't one cry in front of each other,9li7w0

He was also right in seeing that Jack was waaaaaay too much of a mess to go on tour with her or make decisions for her.

Most of his decisions were best for her career, because Jackson was objectively a trainwreck at the time. 

He was always a bit of an asshole, but he had a point. The only time he went too far I think was when he had the 1on1 with Jack. ",9li7w0

e78n3po,I have to think that Jack asking Ally “what” a few times throughout the movie was improv by Bradley Cooper. Great storytelling and direction to keep the conversations natural and give some history on Jack at the same time. Also amazing acting by Lady Gaga to stick with it and be reactionary instead of waiting for her chance to say her lines.,9li7w0

The only version that's slightly different is the 1976 version, and that's because Jon Peters - Barbra Streisand's boyfriend at the time - had a hand in the production.  And he didn't like that ""John Norman Howard"" commits suicide, so they take him out in a high speed car crash so that it's left more ambiguous.  But it's pretty clear, no matter how much he tried to spin the ending, it's suicide.  On his way out, ""Esther"" is still sleeping.  He strokes her face and says, ""Goodbye, my dearest love.""  He's saying goodbye permanently.  If Jon Peters thought he was snowing the audience with ""See?  A car crash!  So he might not have meant it!"", he was simply insulting the audiences' intelligence.

In the 1937 and the 1954 version, ""Norman Maine"" straight up walks into the surf and drowns himself, and then we're back to a clear suicide in 2018, so there's never really any doubt as to what happens to this character, no matter how gently they try to flip it in 1976.

e8elfxp,"this is interesting to me because my friend had a similar impression but I walked away with a slightly different one.  

I thought Jackson believed he had to kill himself because he was worried he would drag Ally down, but by Bobby going ""it was his fault"" he was pointing out that Jackson made the wrong choice (in that he thought he was giving Ally her voice and not being a burden) and that wrong choice was because of his depression/suicidal tendencies and Res was just the trigger to Jackson's illness.  I thought the confession of him trying to kill himself at 13 was very telling and only truly breaking down when he realized he embarrassed Ally....that he was delicate mentally and that he would do anything not to hurt her.

But that wrong choice, in a misguided attempt to save her, ended up nevertheless sort of working inadvertently by bringing her back to how she was when she first started performing and when she met him (the hair dye is gone, the song is more her old style, etc.).

TLDR: I didn't really see it as a story of sacrifice unless we count Ally sticking with him, as my friend did and some of the write-ups did.  I saw it as a story of a good man with demons, who in a misguided attempt to protect the woman he loved, ended up making her live her life to the fullest and become the star she really was.",9li7w0

But what really tore my heart out, was that he committed suicide to prevent himself from holding her back. Was it the best decision? Or one anyone would recommend?

e7j3v2w,"Rez served kind of had an interesting role for a semi small one. I feel in the very literal sense, he was Jack's inner monologue. But he also was Ally's as well. He's the only one in the film that truly fights for what will make her successful. Everyone else around her supports her but none of them were laying down the path to take her to where she could be. Jack did in the beginning but he was kind of doing it selfishly to bring happiness into his own life. Rez pushed Ally but she also had a lot of control at times too, which they kind of alluded to with her choosing her hair color. So she had a inner desire to grow and be something more but was anchored down by all the responsibilities in her life. 

Also in many ways Rez is an antagonist but I also feel that Ally is too. She enables SO much of Jack's bad habits and even though she recognizes his issues, she just glosses over them in the name of love. AOverall, Cooper did a fantastic job building complex and flawed characters and building a very layered tragedy. ",9li7w0

I also loved Gaga and thought she was wonderful, for me at least.....the story was more about Jack. The scene where he cried apologizing to her at the end of his rehab felt SO DAMN REAL.

She is a pop icon already at the mere age of 32. People need to stop sleeping on pop music. Most pop musicians are incredibly talented singers and songwriters. Pop is having a little setback since hiphop dominates the mainstream, but nonetheless theres a lot of quality music people miss out on by being dismissive of pop as a genre.

For me, it was a long time before I finally was able to forgive myself for all the things I did to hurt my loved ones while I drank. Therapy helped me a lot. I dont discount AA meetings, but for me, they always made me feel worse as it was normally people talking about the awful things they did while drinking, I would have rather heard about how good their lives became after stopping.

People say it's a pity that Jack eventually gave in and committed suicide, but what I see is that it's the matter of consequences. Even the film was about a star that is born, there's some kind of cold and sober in it, and everything somehow just makes sense, from the very sudden marriage to the eventual ending.  
And I think that is also what reminds us that there are always choices to change any the slightest things, for Jack, for Ally, and for anyone else in the film.

I think if he hadn't been told this so many times (Father may have said it as well), he might have taken a tougher stance and kicked her manager out.

ecndnyc,"I can't believe people are even saying that. I completely agree with you, in no way does this film glamourise or make suicide look attractive?! To be honest, I think people just get over sensitive when suicide is portrayed at all, and that causes this reaction of thinking its implying something it isn't... It makes me angry, and in fact I think its healthier to be open and to portray suicide honestly, and to show all the repercussions and ripples of an ultimately selfish act. ",9li7w0

Nobody on here seems to recognize that his depression, alcoholism, and drug use are fed by his tinnitus. He used those substances to get away from the ringing. To feel normal. Many people with tinnitus have considered suicide (maybe not seriously considered it but considered it none the less). His fear of holding back Ally was merely the straw that broke the camel's back. People don't kill themselves the first time they think about suicide. This wasn't just about Ally.

I was so excited when I heard that this movie was going to have a character with tinnitus. I was excited for the awareness of how much of an issue it can be for sufferers. My heart breaks a little bit more everytime I read a post about how this movie tackled no new issues or that the suicide was about Ally.

What did your boyfriend think?

Edit- One thing that's scary is that he didn't kill himself until he got sober. He no longer had an escape. ",9li7w0

e8elnoh,"Yep. He first writes it off as his dad having a mid-life crisis, but it sounds more like statuory rape when that is revealed later on.  I think it's supposed to illustrate slowly over the movie that he doesn't just have regular demons, he has serious demons in that he had a very troubled childhood, depression (he tried to kill himself when he was 13), and medical and addiction issues and those demons eventually got the better of him despite his love for Ally.",9li7w0

I agree, one minute he’s a drunk yogi walking the tight rope of life the next he’s washed up. Maybe a couple of failed performances or something would have added to it. I also think there’s a stark difference in one half of the movie the couple is on an even keel and healthy and not drama-based. Then the next he’s calling her ugly. Then pisses himself for good measure. And she wouldn’t have left him on the Grammy stairs, she was a nutter about him. ",9li7w0

Also,if you go in blind, I could understand how you would be emotionally wrecked because its been a long ass time since the climax of a good movie was sad and unexpected but satisfying because we re so used to comic book movies that hit at the right level of sentimental death, like
Yondu. This is different because you identify with them a lot of hard than the average movie nowadays, its a rarity 

Its like Ned Stark all over again",9li7w0
ealocht,"I feel like Cooper was trying to simulate the ebbs and flows of real life, and how Jack and Ally were on somewhat different paths. It could just be revisionist history, but that's the feeling that I walked away with after the movie.",9li7w0

e7i7vwi,"I agree, his death felt quite cold and less than significant than it should have, perhaps also because it just didn't quite seem emotionally honest? For two characters building careers around expressing their souls, they didn't communicate at all, but maybe that's one of the ironies. ",9li7w0
e7k5lmf,"I totally agree about this and thought it at the time. With that said, having it watched it last night it's impacted me more than I thought it did so I'm actually quite glad they didn't completely nail it!",9li7w0

But then I forgot about that detail and his death really shocked me at the end.

ee8zqp3,"I don't think it was ever jealousy. She thought it was, but she was lacking perspective. I spent a decade in the music industry (not that I think you need to to read this next point) but the look I read on Jack's face was one of disillusionment with the industry and what it does to people. The title track of the movie is ""shallow"" and that's exactly what the pop industry is. The depth of soulful meaning exists in the type of music Jack writes. Pop is a marketing machine. Jack was recognizing that opportunistic machine has its grip on ally, and he was afraid it would disappoint her or worse, change her into something different than the authentic girl he had originally met.

Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, and Supporting Actor (for Elliot) seem like reasonably likely noms also. Maybe a Director nom for Cooper too though that's a crowded field this year & they might hold the relative safeness of the material + his first-timer status against him.

She has been working with electronic music producers and pop songwriters since last year.

She had a electronic pop album almost done in 2015 but scrapped it and decided to do Joanne instead, so there is no shortage of pop music waiting to be released. 

She has always been talented and can take on many different genres but pop is where she's at. Her fanbase is mostly pop fans. There's no way she will give up pop music. ",9li7w0

Bobby resented this because Jack not only stole his vocal style, but his dream as well.

He goes outside and slowly walks to the ocean and the walks in the water slowly... it was very eerie and beautifully shot and acted. Add in Garlands acting afterwards... wow. GaGa did great but people claiming she outdid Garland are crazy.

Like... the music industry turned Rez into an asshole but he actually got into it for the music.

Maybe that’s subtly what Cooper intended. Had that final convo had one or two more lines about how Rez respected him but was pissed at Maine’s actions, it would have held more weight for me. I just saw potential in that scene. Rez could have completely surprised us as an audience had they gone that route - and his shitty comments perhaps could have held more weight for Jackson since it would have been coming from an ex-fan. That’s VERY nitpicky, though. Rez as a character is just a bit too one-note, and a slight change was needed.

Very good film overall, though.",9li7w0
e7elf6e,"I mean, unfortunately for everyone in the normal, non-depressed non-addicted world... Ally's manager Rez isn't WRONG. He IS a drain on her career, if only because she's willing to cancel entire tours to stay home and be with him. 

But that was Ally's choice to make and I respected her for putting her husband ahead of a career tbh. What is love vs fame? I think she would have given all the fame back to stay with Jackson.

And Jack's brother isn't wrong, either. It isn't Ally's fault that Jack spiraled out and killed himself, and he was on that trajectory before Ally showed up. The problem was that Jack didn't sincerely seek help for his issues until it threatened his relationship with Ally - he didn't have a good reason to care about going on until he had her. He was likely going to kill himself if he'd never met her (probably not by suicide but OD) and I don't think he would have cared if he did because depression does you like that. Depression is shitty, I have it and I've tried (and failed) to kill myself twice, but it's no one else's fault that I'm here... and unfortunately I'm the only person that can drag myself out, and it's hard and I don't really want to. I think that's what his brother meant. Jack didn't really try - and with depression, the further you go, the longer and harder it is to walk back. 

That said her manager is definitely a douche. I don't think he got fired, but she dyed her hair back when she sang that final song for Jack, which I took as proof that she was now taking charge of her image and not letting him pull so many strings.",9li7w0
e7d3jja,"Yeah, I really didn't like when he said it was Jack's fault. I like to think it's similar to what Ally was telling Jack in rehab-it's a disease. He fought it almost his entire life, at least from what I can tell with the little background info we got throughout the movie. About the manager though, I think you're right-life isn't fair. Stuff like that happens and it sucks.",9li7w0
e7dgj8f,"I think they did this on purpose.  I was waiting for the music industry to screw someone over in this movie, but I was expecting it to be in some cackling/maniacal/villainous way.  I had kinda given up on it happening a little before the scene when Rez (or whatever his name was) had the talk with Jackson.  

I think part of the point also was that Rez either pushed him to this on purpose or callously never considered what it might do, and that he clearly suffered no consequences.  

I can think of other movies where the person who perpetrated some catastrophic event in the plot specifically squeaked by without any negative consequences, and that's what adds an insult to the injury in those movies. ",9li7w0

They kind of expect the actors to figure it out on their own and only give notes when something has to be adjusted.  The benefit of ""A Star Is Born"" is Lady Gaga was being directed by a seasoned actor who knows what it's like from the inside out -- he probably got her to tap into the kind of confidence she has in interviews and performing in music videos.  She knows how to be natural when she's being asked questions so she was probably told to maintain that honest tone, etc.  A lot of times, without someone pointing this out, musicians think acting is a completely different animal and they approach it by fixating solely on the dialogue and it comes off robotic.",9li7w0

I saw The Wife and feel that Glenn Close's performance was great but think that Gaga's was a little better.

efnclvz,"The suicide seemed a bit forced, and I didn't think the film stressed enough that it was obviously the wrong solution to life's problems no matter what and there were other options. If they were going to go down that route, I feel like it would have been better, storywise, for his ""breaking point"" to be something more than embarrassing himself and Ally at the Grammys.  Like as cringe worthy and awful as that scene was, in real life people love a comeback story after people fall in the gutter for men, especially white men (women aren't usually afforded that comeback or POC), so the Rez bit didn't really resonate nor the idea that it would hurt Ally's career badly (people like a wronged woman narrative or a long suffering wife narrative). I think the point was that hurting Ally, and not himself, was what made him go to rehab, I just think ""narratively"" that it could have been done in a way where Rez goes ""you are damaging her career/ruining her life"" would have more of an impact—like have him somehow fuck up her record deal, or perhaps get in a drunk driving accident with Ally in the a car.  

But yes, I agree that the third act was kind of hard to follow. He's popular enough that randoms are recognizing him at the grocery store and he has a private plane, but in a few years (and I don't think the story was supposed to be longer than like 2 years) he's a total wash-up?  And I got the impression that the message was supposed to be that there was a happy medium between Jackson and Rez's word, but that also seemed muddled.

I actually think the story could have benefited from a few changes like the much maligned 1970s version or the 1950s version. Either have his character clean his act up entirely and be at peace with his declining career, but die in a random accident to drive home the point that life is short, or spend more time on Gaga's character in the third act and perhaps have him, as a twist, not die and end the film on him watching her from the wings while she is the ""star.""  Or just go full on, like in the 1950s, and make his character an even more troubled so the suicide doesn't seem like a surprise.

I actually liked the film a lot, and think it's better than nearly every other film I've seen this year with the exception of Roma, Cold War, and If Beale Street Could Talk.  And I vastly preferred it to La La Land and Ryan Gosling's white savior of jazz character.  Cold War also does a good job at capturing that moment of first or intense love. I just thought it was a bit frustrating, as it was a very good movie that could have been ""great"" imo.  ",9li7w0

I really thought things were going to work out when he started wearing his hearing aids!

eapf8sq,"The way I saw it, his decision, if that is what you might call it was more complex than just what the agent told him. Jack was from the beginning shown to be deeply depressed, using alcohol as a crutch to staying alive. Then he meets this woman who gave his life meaning again. It's been shown how much Jack cared about staying true to oneself and not wasting talent. He was disappointed in his brother and then later he became disappointed in Ally as well.

I think Jack was a very self-centred character. He seemed to expect that Ally would save him and give his life meaning again. However that hope quickly vanished when she started to pursue a music career in pop music. Since he did still love her, he tried his best to be supportive. But his own desires took priority over her happiness. Her first concert, her award ceremony, her last show; rather than understanding how important those events were for Ally, they were more strikingly a reminder to him that things had not turned out the way that he had hoped.

To me, Jack was battling heavily with this internal conflict of trying to be happy for her whilst truthfully being disappointed; trying to be supportive, yet wanting her to be more. He began struggling again with his alcoholism, and facing up to his long bout with depression. But at the very least he would try to be a better man for her sake. However after talking with the agent, he concludes that Ally would actually be better off without him. Notice that again, like all other previous events, he put little care into how his actions may have actually affected the woman he supposedly loved. In the end, I don't think that what the agent told him was necessarily the reason for his suicide, but perhaps a ""permission"" of some sort to end it.",9li7w0
ebwnxzt,"What Rez has said could be just the last straw on Jack's already exhausted mind.

I've been fighting with my food addiction and eating disorder, trying to lose weight for the past ten years. The movie depicts an addiction really well, so well that I truly feel immense empathy for him throughout the whole film.

It really is just like a downward spiral to your own demise, it's extremely hard to control, you can have better days like when Jack's clear for two months in the movie. But there's always this lurking sense of insecurity inside your mind, constantly reminding you of the times you have failed in the past, and that this time is no difference from those failures. Then Rez, had to be a total asshole and reinforce that sense of insecurity Jac already has by saying that he's going to fall back to alcoholism again not before long.

It's very easy to get depressed and have dark thoughts under that state of mind. Especially when you are at your lowest point, all it takes is just a slight push towards the wrong direction.

He knew she cancelled the European tour because she couldn’t bring him (she lied and told him the label cancelled it, but Jackson had already talked to the manager and so he knew that wasn’t true).  The thought that he’d relapse and hurt her again probably didn’t help, but I think it was more about him feeling like he was keeping her from reaching her goals.

Essentially, that pop is a valid form of music but that it can also be trite at times.  Dianne Warren also argued that the butt song wasn't meant to be purposefully bad....so who knows?

But yeah, I thought the message was supposed to be that there is a happy medium between Jackson's world and Rez's world, but that it was sort of muddled and unclear.  Obviously, there were folks who had different interpretations as I read a few reviews and one thought it was meant to argue that all pop is fake while the other thought we were supposed to be critical of Cooper's character coming down on pop.

I think it would have been interesting if a more experienced director and screenwriter had taken on the project and tweaked the script and the third act.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of the praise comes for the first half of the movie, which does semi-melodramatic job at capturing that feeling when people fall for one another/the beginning of a love story. There aren't a lot of well made melodramas these days in film (although I can think of a few on TV, like Big Little Lies), most are either straight up lifetime film esque, so I think that's where some of the praise comes from.  

&#x200B;",9li7w0
ehxd1ab,"As someone else on who's been on the creative side of the music industry (writing/producing pop) I don't agree with you. There IS only Jackson's way or Rez's way, and you can only make it in this business by being raised up and supported by more powerful people and plentiful resources. Why Ally decided to use Rez's resources as opposed to Jack's is beyond me, because I was not under the impression her character was after fame for the sake of fame.

&#x200B;

I did not understand how Ally, who had a perfectly viable singer-songwriter persona and decent songs to back it, would throw that to the wayside and start signing about asses in the club especially with someone like Jackson in her corner. It made no sense.

Two days later I am literally weepy about it, trying to figure out why I’m feeling this delayed melancholy. None of it relates to me life in any way. 

The best theory I have is that the Jackson character was so tragic that there really was no hope for him, and he had an almost childlike innocence that just made it even more gutting. He was just a tender heart who was born into a terrible life, and got swept up in the current with no chance of getting out. It really feels like he had zero control because of the damage done when he was a child. It is ripping my heart to pieces. ",9li7w0

e7xljjb,"She really is beautiful when she's more toned down.   And it's interesting how they play her looks both up and down in the movie.  One of Ally's insecurities, thanks to the cruelty of other people, has been her looks, when they've told her she's ugly.  But Jackson thinks she's beautiful.

When she begins getting famous, they change her looks - they slather on the makeup, they color her hair that unnatural shade of orange.  Later in the movie when they have the fight in the bathroom when he's totally drunk and calls her ""ugly"" - that one of the things that hits her because people have always made her insecure about her looks.  But if you listen closely to what he's saying during his drunken rambling, he's saying, ""They made you ugly.""  Meaning - he always found her beautiful the way she is, but then they loaded her up with tons of makeup and colored her hair.  My guess is he didn't truly find her ""ugly"" - that was him during a drunken, angry rant.  But in his mind, she didn't look the same as she did when he fell in love with her.

It's also pretty evident during her last song that she sings in tribute to him.  She's still glamorous and lovely, but she's hardly wearing any makeup and her hair is back to it's natural color.  She's much lovelier on her own.  And then it nicely segues into the earlier clip of them singing together back when they first met.

It's a shame that in this day and age, a woman's looks can still be tied into a movie so intricately, but it's been that way in every version of ""A Star is Born"".  I remember when I was a kid, I read the book version that came out when the 1976 movie was released.  And one of the things that ""John Norman Howard"" loves about ""Esther"" are her unconventional looks.   They describe him as thinking to himself that ""she has qualities that were better than conventional prettiness.""  I was an ugly duckling as a kid, so the fact that this unconventional looking woman had other qualities that made her beautiful was powerful to me.  When you're constantly dogged about your looks, it shapes the way you think people are seeing you.  So I really related to that as a kid, and then again during this one.  I had read a review and there was a blurb about the bathroom fight, and I went into this thinking he drunkenly goes after her about being ""ugly"" for her natural looks.  But when you see it, it's clear that he's angry because they covered up the woman he already found beautiful.

I also find it kind of symbolic and a nod to the way the manager changed her whole musical style.  She has this beautiful, pure unspoiled way of singing when we first meet her.  But the manager gets a hold of her, and soon she's got dancers and auto-tune and a light show.  Before you know it, she's a Britney-style performer and the Ally that the audience originally fell in love with when Jackson first brings her onstage at his concert is gone.  That's another way to look at the ""ugly"" remark.  The manager over produced and manufactured this beautiful, raw talent into a pop-package that she never was to start with.",9li7w0

You have Jack calling her out, but he's not really reliable, so I'm not sure if the movie wanted me to agree with him Re Ally's pop persona or see him as a pretentious douche that didn't really appreciate what Ally was trying to go for.  

But when she meets the manager he says I'll take you where you want - but we never see Ally answer that question.  She has a few quibbles about the dancers and hair color, but again it's unclear if she feels she's betraying her vision or if she doesn't have a vision and is being completely controlled or if this is her vision. 

Then the film ends with Ally changing her hair, implying that Jack was right about her being in authentic?

That Clockwork Orange color... blah). And the outfit she wore to rehab. Like ok, we get it, you're hammering the point - she's a different person now. But really, an ""Oh oh oh"" blouse, leopard furry boots and snakeskin purple leather pants? Wowza. What year is this?? It's a lot of lewk.

That's definitely on purpose. Her looks were very bold, with heavy use of blue and orange  (complimentary, or opposite colors). The effect is really garish and theatrical, which is a huge departure from who we know her to be in the beginning. Even when she's at the drag club performing, she looks nothing like she does later as a pop-star.

Her look symbolizes how she's not being her authentic self - and Jack calls her out on it. It's only at the end of the film as her hair is back to it's original color and her wardrobe/makeup is toned down that she's being truthful with her audience. ",9li7w0

Her selling out is the big moment when the dynamic between them changes and creates the major rift in their relationship that leads towards the tragic ending.",9li7w0

I think losing Jackson would be a catalyst enough to change Ally and push her towards what she originally wanted to do. ",9li7w0
e7j2ym3,She sings his song at the end in front of a big orchestra with no pop beats or backup dancers. I think the implication is that she takes her music in a different direction from what the manager wanted.,9li7w0
e7mmrvb,"The only thing I would point out from interviews I've seen, is that they tried to correct the whole 'his downfall comes from her rising' storyline which has been labelled anti-feminist in the past. The whole point is that Jackson is his own downfall, not Ally. In the previous versions, the mens' outbursts come from not being able to accept that they are on the way out while the female character gets to shine (equating her success as the real reason for their failure). The tension in Jack/Ally's relationship comes from her changing who she is to achieve acclaim, but never is he meant to be jealous of her success, he's critical of the way she achieves it. If anything the latter half of the film goes on to explain really well his internal struggle being completely unrelated to Ally.  I think thats where your review here fails to understand what the real stakes-themes of the movie are.",9li7w0
e7mx0t8,"Cooper emulates Kris Kristofferson way more than James Mason in the way he handles Ally's rise and his fall. My take on the end wasn't that he was feeling like a washed up has-been, but that he was no longer good enough for her, but in 1976 Kristofferson was definitely feeling like a has-been. But the ending is a bit different.",9li7w0
e7moit5,"yeah so Cooper basically admits that the career downfall aspect of the originals isn't very plausible today.  Consider rockstars who completely lose their voices, but still sell out huge venues even in their 70s.  I mean, I just saw a sold out Jethro Tull concert and the lead singer lost his voice years ago ... there's literally parts where they just have pre-recorded vocals playing.

The corporate gig isn't really a sign of him having a downfall either.  That just goes with the territory.  Literally last week in Seattle there was a private corporate event for some company called ""Seattle Genetics"" where The Killers and Gwen Stefani reportedly played.    A few years back I saw Dave Matthews do a surprise show at the Bellevue Mall to promote the opening of a Microsoft store.  That shit isn't necessarily a sign of the guy being washed up.  They just presumably get paid stupid amounts of money for a quick little show.

I read an interview with Cooper where he said something to the extent of, the previous versions focused on the male character growing jealous of the female's rise - and angry at his career stalling, but that aspect just wasn't interesting to him.  Instead, he wanted to delve into an aspect of the character not previously explored - his background and problems that go untreated.

That said, I agree with you fully that the biggest problem with this movie is the source material.  For the most part, it remains faithful to the other versions.  Everything from the award show on is part of the other iterations.  I just had trouble buying it... It just felt rushed to me or like it doesn't really play.  The idea that he kills himself because he feels he's holding her back - it just feels a little over the top and shlocky to me - something that probably worked in the 30s and 50s when the other versions came out, but for whatever reason made me roll my eyes a little today.  Kinda like how the ending of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is kinda ridiculous in some respects, but it's the story so we accept it.  That's not to say that famous musicians don't commit suicide, it's just that how it plays out in this movie feels heavy handed and I don't really blame Cooper for it.  I blame the source.",9li7w0

e7a4wmh,I completely agree with this comment. The middle parts of the film were very typical and the themes have been overworked in Hollywood (that might have been the point though) but the ending brought it back up to a solid 8/10 for me. It was unexpected and I enjoyed it.,9li7w0
e7a1hg8,You correct in the movie sort of fizzling out.  It's hard to tell the whole story in two hours.  I let thinking this  movie is goi g to be too long because there is still so much story to tell but then it ended.  I think Cooper did a great job with the time he had.  ,9li7w0

I definitely think realistically it usually looks good on a celebrity (or anyone) to stay with their partner during times like that. It's not like Jackson was SCANDALOUS as far as we know, he was mentally ill with a major addiction problem. We at least aren't aware of any run ins with the law or any like racist rants or anything like that. ",9li7w0
e7dcu9c,"Agree with it all. Only comment I have (as someone who also dislikes country) is I took him to be a country boy, playing rock music. His tunes felt way more late 70's rock to me. But I'm also not from that era and could be wrong.",9li7w0
e7bllsn,"My interpretation of the film's narrative was not a commentary on discounting ""pop music"" it was more about highlighting the superficial nature and loss of self in the machine of pop music ""GENERALLY SPEAKING "". Hence, the juxtaposition between ""The Shallow vs Hair Body Face"". But, having said that, obviously you can still have great ""pop music"" with authentic meaning and depth eg: Born this Way or even Paparazzi which is commentary on fame.

&#x200B;

The bathtub scene embodies this narrative, He even  points out her lyrics about "" Why'd you come around me with an ass like that."" He even calls her ugly, even though he's drunk I don't think he means she is physically ugly. But, her heart is ugly, because she betrayed the way she used to write meaningful heartfelt lyrics. I believe as an audience we are meant to believe that Ally embraced the (general) shallowness of ""pop music"" to realise her dream of becoming a star and in the process lost sight of the deeper meaning behind songwriting and powerful the vessel that music is.",9li7w0
e7bumax,"I was expecting this to be the main drama of the film, Jack disagreeing with how Ally sold out and wrote cheap songs and catered her unauthentic image to mast audiences, and the two of them falling out. Ally and Jack both briefly expressed disgust with this, but the idea of was never mentioned again and life went on like nothing was wrong with this at all.

Ally's songs as a pop star then would have made a decent commentary on the music industry.",9li7w0
e80nwia,"Re: the point about Lady Gaga's music, I think the attitude about Ally's music isn't about the genre per se, it's about the fact that it's out of character *for her*. The whole movie we see her writing these powerful, emotional songs, but then on SNL she gets up there and performs a shallow (lol), emotionless pop tune to choreography that was forced on her by her manager. Not to mention the fact that it comes right after Jack talked to her about using music to say what *she* wants to say.

Lady Gaga has said that she and Ally are different people, so the fact that Ally put on a Lady Gaga-esque performance is weird for her character and should feel out of place to the viewer.",9li7w0

I'm really happy it ended the way it did, though. Very, very true to depression (medicating with alcohol, feeling like a burden on everybody, etc). Her lying to him at the end because she didn't want to pile on the hurt, but the lies just compounded the hurt and made him feel like an even bigger brick tied to her feet.

The best analogy I can think of is kind of a silly premise but hopefully it makes the point for me - it’s like if Isamu Noguchi walked through a quarry and selected an early sculpture by Constantin Brancusi to recut into his own art. There’s no shortage of raw material ambition in the world, and he could have turned any number of
people into the type of star she was, but she had something very unique, and it was a shame to see it overpowered. The manager was an artist in his own right, he shaped people into the vision he saw for himself of them.",9li7w0

e8d89uj,"I'm a long time Kanye fan, consider myself very empathetic and have dealt with my own mental health issues so hear me out. But I think the reason Kanye doesn't receive much sympathy is because he's known for purposely doing and saying things to incite a reaction - usually in the form of shock and outrage - with no regards for other people's feelings. 

People like Demi Lovato, Mac Miller, and this case, Jackson Maine, seem to have more of a positive public image. The word adoration comes to mind. Of course this is all based off my own speculations but I think public perception and reputation play a lot into how people view things like this and I think Kanye just has that asshole reputation. 

&#x200B;

And just to be clear I'm not saying because someone has a certain reputation they deserve to be treated less than but let's be honest. The public eye is brutal and people love to vilify celebrities and public figures. ",9li7w0
e8eks7e,"The thing is at the time, Kanye seemed sober and no one knew he had mental issues back in 2009. The other thing is Taylor was only 19 or 20, she was a kid, and he was a grown ass adult.  Ally and Jackson were adults.  Also, the general public is often far more tough on Black celebrities who mess up because of racism, but in Kanye's case it has more to do with a escalating series of events.

I do agree that Jackson's disaster probably could have been spun positively.  If someone's been to rehab multiple times, people stop feeling so empathetic, but at that time he hadn't been to rehab and he never had his drinking affect his performance until that night.  Country and rock stars are also known to sometimes be hard living, he didn't make his fame on being a family man.

That was the one thing I didn't buy with Res, or I thought it was hyperbolic for him to act like Jackson was dragging Ally's career down.  The only way he could have hurt her career is by her giving up her European tour to stay with him, but even then if she's selling out the Forum and winning a grammy the record label could overlook it.  People love stand by your man shit for the most part, so i really don't think Jackson's fuck up would have hurt Ally—in fact, I think people would be sympathetic that she stuck by him and got him into rehab.

As someone who has an alcoholic father and brother, I can tell you this is *completely* normal, not inconsistent. Alcoholism destroys everything around it and it's so complex, the emotions it invokes are all over the place. One day you're weepy and hurt because you love the person and you rationally know they're suffering, but other days your pain and frustration gets the better of you. If she had been entirely loving and understanding the whole time (or angry and hurt) with no fluctuations, she wouldn't be human and that would've been more unrealistic to me. ",9li7w0
e7wom89,"First of all, I think it's ridiculous that people are downvoting you because you don't think it's an amazing movie. I, like you, really had a very difficult time feeling any sympathy whatsoever for the character of Jackson Maine. I did not understand why the theater was in tears at the end because my opinion was that she was better off without him because he came off as a selfish prick. The only entity I felt bad for in this movie was the dog. The pissing his pants was over the top and the suicide scene was so long and drawn out I let out a sigh and said, ""enough already."" Also, I call bullshit on a guy with that kind of money and fame having a pick up truck that old.
 
That said, Gaga's totally getting an Academy Award for best song. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets a couple of nominations for best song out of this.

e7cd4pj,"I saw this as part of the story line tbh. Once she became a “star” she wasn’t necessarily looking wearing or singing what she REALLY would’ve wanted to - which I think it something women in the industry often battle with. They listen to their manager versus their heart that holds their art/talent. I want to say Gaga dealt with this IRL in the beginning of her career too.  They only really show us a little of it how the manager/agent has more power on her thoughts than Jack at the end and that Jack is bothered by some of the changes because he knows it’s not her authentic self he fell in love with.. and ultimately that continues to his death, oh and the jackass manager",9li7w0
e7ce85l,"This is pretty much my take as well. My quibbles (which will probably be explained in the director's cut):

&#x200B;

\- She knows he's an alcoholic and (I think she knows) an addict. She marries him, and then starts questioning his drinking and sloppy behavior? 

&#x200B;

\- The whole relationship with Jackson and his brother. Why bring up the ""stole my voice"" thing if you're not going to delve into it a little deeper? I'm still not sure exactly where they were going with that. Also, the brother leaves the tour, then a handful of scenes later, he's back in the game. There's a scene where Jackson asks him to come back, he declines, and then he's back in the picture again.  

&#x200B;

\- This kinda confused me. Jackson's Dad had him when he was, what, 63 or something? But his brother accuses Jackson of being his Dad's drinking buddy? I think I really missed something in this segment.

&#x200B;

\- The hearing thing. It's referenced a number of times, but never really explored in any depth.

&#x200B;

I guess in the end I felt like the reasons for Jackson's spiral should have been explored a little deeper, and I was pretty disappointed they didn't really get into his lack of respect for her career choice more, which seemed blatantly obvious. I just felt like they touched on a lot of great options, without really diving deep into any of them.

&#x200B;

In the end, thought it was a very good movie, a 7/8 rating, and there were some highly emotional scenes that were really well done and I thought both major performances were well done, but I wasn't quite as enthralled as most others. I might bump that number up a bit on rewatch or director's cut, though. ",9li7w0

As you pointed out, Jack continues to hammer in the importance of having something to say, but to his dismay, Ally falls deeper and deeper into the role of a generic pop star. This causes Jack to fall deeper into his alcoholism and drug abuse, as he doesn't know how else to deal with his disappointment in her and in himself for what he perceives to be a failure to steer her on the right path. In the finale of the film, largely due to what Ally's manager says to Jack, Jack comes to the realization that he will always hold her career back, and always cause her grief, and the best way to solve this is to kill himself. HOWEVER, with his final act on earth, and through Ally's own self-reflection, she finally understands what it means to ""have something to say,"" and with her final performance she shows the world that she is truly a star (I would even argue that the very last shot of Ally is the moment ""a star is born"").",9li7w0

As you'd expect, her singing was out of this world, but her acting...to me she seemed to be channeling Cher but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  maybe a bit too NY/Long Island for a character who is supposed to be a native Californian (certainly not unforgivable, though).  

Cooper knocked it out of the park as Jackson. As much love as Gaga gets, Cooper carried this movie.  As writer/director/actor/producer, I expected a total Hollywood vanity project that would be All Things Bradley (with Lady Gaga singing), but he gave each of his castmates room to breathe and shine -even Andrew Dice Clay (whose schtick was never believable when he was at the height of his fame).

Abusive? I think that word is starting to get abused. In what way was the relationship abusive?

Your argument about the film’s message only works if the film is taking the stance that Cooper’s suicide was justified. It definitely isn’t.

>Ally's damn manager was the cause of it

There's a difference between a cause and a trigger. The cause of Jackson's suicide was a difficult childhood, decades of mental health issues, substance abuse and alcoholism. What Ally's manager said was merely a trigger, and I certainly don't think the movie implied that Ally's manager thought that Jackson would kill himself and was trying to encourage him to do so. Someone else in this thread theorised that the scene where Ally's manager said what he said wasn't actually real, it was symbolic of what Jackson was thinking and feeling. Whether that's what the writer/director was going for, I don't know, but Jackson obviously felt that everything Ally's manager said was true, and that was his trigger. But it wasn't the cause. Think about it like this, if someone said that to you, would you kill yourself? No. There's probably nothing that 1 person could say that would make you actually go through with the process of taking your life. There has to be a deeper cause behind it. That's where the decades of mental health problems come in. That's the real cause.",9li7w0

He seemed like he was already sinking into depression since the beginning of the film. I think the fact that he killed himself was the resolution of the story.",9li7w0
e79537f,"It’s a horrible ending and it ruins the entire message of the film.

We don’t need more fucking Hollywood movies that romanticize alcoholism and depression and then use suicide as a way to try and provoke an emotional response, it’s almost always cheap and very difficult to do properly.

Melodrama is fine, there’s nothing wrong with a movie that sets out to provoke an emotional response because crying in the movies is a genuinely cathartic experience.

But showing a character struggle with addiction only to have them kill themselves after genuinely trying to make a difference sends such a horrible message. 

Anyone who has suffered through these issues seriously I would hope agrees with me. I hate pulling this card but I personally have struggled with alcohol abuse and was hospitalized after a suicide attempt last year so all I’m thinking is that Hollywood needs to change their god damn approach to this because it is tired, unearned and downright dangerous. 

Maybe I am projecting but it’s just so cheap to do this.

Welcome to suicide from the perspective of anyone who isn't contemplating or committing it. Glad to hear you got absolutely nothing from the movie, despite the very clear picture it paints of a man who feels to his very core that his existence is a burden on those he loves most. ",9li7w0
ei4kpjp,"> Also Jack's suicide after completing rehab and returning to a loving wife and a house he said finally felt like a home made no sense to me. Pretty boring movie that tried to be dark and gripping with hearing loss and alcoholism.

It is because the agent says something that he realizes that he is a burden on Ally. But it wasn't so much the agent but Ally saying that she would cancel the tour that pushed him over the edge. This is the same trigger event that led to the death of Jackson/Norman Maine in the other versions. He loves her too much to stand in the way of her success. 

When considering his mental illness, it is because he truly believes in her that leads Jackson to think that she would be better off without him in the picture. As someone who suffers from chronic depression, this is an extremely accurate portrayal of someone suffering from suicidal thoughts. 

And in perhaps the most beautiful stroke of genius, director Bradley Cooper uses Ally's pain and suffering to lead her to express her innermost pain and longing -- it is only in the final moments of the film that we finally see her becoming a star (hence the movie's name). 

This is highlighted by the lighting of Ally. Throughout the film we see Ally bathed in mostly red light during her musical scenes, with intermediate bits of white mixed in between. The more artificial/impersonal she is (e.g. the drag bar, her pop songs), the more red; the more authentic to her true self, the more white (e.g. the parking lot scene, ""I'll Always Remember Us This Way"", and especially ""I'll Never Love Again"").

I've seen three of the four versions and can say that they are all classics that represent a time and place in not only film but also the eras in which they were made. This film is easily the most straightforward and authentic in its theme; don't be ""shallow"". 

Everyone has a story to tell and you cannot let anything get in the way of that goal if you wish to truly achieve greatness. Ally will never reach that goal if she stays in the ""shallows"" -- she needs to dive into the deep end and expose her pain and share it with her audience. The entire story was designed to get her to this point. 

I personally believe that this film was not only successful in telling its story but was a beautiful retelling of perhaps the ultimate Hollywood story.",9li7w0

e90q2vg,I can agree there should be a bit more criticism regarding how toxic he was toward Ally. But I think the sympathy comes from his attempts to get clean and being unable to overcome his demons.,9li7w0
e8orh8i,"Because, for all his shitty behavior, he actually truly cares for Ally and her integrity. He sees through the changes the manager is hoisting on her and the person she has to become for fame and it all rings back to his original conversation with her (regarding her big nose and why she gave up).

He's not a great person, but he was finally starting to focus on getting back on track and right at that point, you see him realizing just what you said. That if he relapses, the only person he hurts is Ally (and to a degree, even without doing so). This terrifies him, because that's the worst he could be made to feel. So his death resonates that chord of a broken soul, and people feel for that.

And moreso. With his death, Ally is able to fully pull back to the person she is and the way she feels about her music. She gets to grow and regain her integrity but at the loss of the person she loves most. So, you're hit doubly by his loss, through her grief.",9li7w0

The way I saw it (even before the movie) is that the manufactured pop super-stardom that's becoming so big now isn't taking away Jack's career in the sense of him finding less work, it's taking away the future of songwriters like Jack as newer generations are less concerned with the artists that actually have something to say and more interested in manufactured pop music light shows with no substance.

I agree with your point about the editing; some cuts were just awkward, including cut leading to the shot of the teary-eyed older brother backing up in the car. To be fair, in the last scene, the cut to Jack singing to Ally at home was quite effective!

The cinematography during the concert scenes felt messy. I don't know if this was intentional, i.e. trying to express the energy of the setting, or if it was due to the practical limits of filming during actual concerts. 

The performances from the leads were excellent.

He was an alcoholic and a drug addict who had attempted suicide before. He was madly in love with her. He was drunk the entire movie, and even used his boot to crush pills to snort off a coffee table.  Ally was the only thing that made him happy and in his unhealthy mind, he got to the point that he was hurting the only thing he truly loved. 

Ally's manager telling him he was fucking up her career, corroborated by his realizing that Ally was lying to him when she told him her tour was being cancelled (because she would rather give that up than be without him), further fueled his sickness in thinking that he was ruining her happiness.

Addiction is a disease, and he felt that his existence was ultimately hurting her, which drove him over the edge. It was never about jealousy or not wanting to support her or not being in the spotlight as the alternative solution. He was not mentally healthy.",9li7w0

We are told that when he apologizes to her at the rehab center. On top of all of the emotions he is going through, he is still an addict, and as such he is unable to make what would be a rational decision. So what made the most sense to him would be to kill himself. ",9li7w0

I cried because I am a singer/songwriter who has struggled with depression and substance abuse.   My older brother and my relationship is very similar to the brothers in this film.  I met and fell in love with my wife whom is a singer....and in Arizona.  Those are just a few reasons I absolutely WEPT about a dozen times over the last few days while listening to the soundtrack.

e7bko9z,"You’re so far off it’s kinda funny...

She originally doesn’t go to Jack’s show because she’s on the fence about the whole thing. She even tells her dad that the drinking is a concern. When her boss is rude to her, she’s like, I don’t need this, so she leaves and goes to the show. I don’t know what you mean by “no where else to go” because we see that she lives with her dad. And then her and Jack fall in love, and I wouldn’t say she ignores the substance abuse, it’s a big part of the ups and downs of their relationship.

She does sell out but that doesn’t make her a “bad person”. There’s a distance when he’s in rehab because he’s there, and well, shes not. And he almost derailed her whole career, so some time apart might’ve been a good thing. The movie doesn’t spend a lot of time on the rehab scene.

And the part you’re most off about is her fishing to get him to say “do the tour”. The lie she told him was that the label wants her to stay here and make another album. But we know that she cancelled the tour because she wanted to tour with Jackson but her label wouldn’t allow it, so she quit.  That’s the kind of thing a good person would do, not a bad one. Somehow you missed the entire point of that.


The tribute wasn’t without emotion. She was literally crying. She could barely talk. She dyed her hair back to normal and (I assume) the cut to piano is what she was thinking about when she was singing at the end. It clearly affected her a lot.

That love became harmful but life is messy and many times, especially when addiction is involved love is messy. The moments of clarity and redemption, however small they were when Jack was sober gave her a reason to fight for him even if he was too far gone and that was heartbreaking and believe me it happens all the time and this film shows it masterfully.

I thought his directing style fit the subject matter perfectly. I felt the scenes were shot almost through a lense of his substance abuse yet lady Gaga's seemed to be seen through a rose colored lens (not literally but figuratively).

I think your whole thing about it being deeply American is a surface viewpoint. I can see where you're coming from but the whole ""Ally rise to stardom"" storyline is a side storyline. It's about Jack finding something he'd been searching for his entire life (someone who saw those twelve notes the way Ally did) and the struggle to nurture that amidst his addiction. In the end he'd rather die than tarnish that any further.

I know it's called ""A Star is Born"" and that makes one think the movie is about a rise to stardom for an unknown talent, but I interpreted the title to mean a star was born into Jack's life and how he coped and dealt with the impact of that. ",9li7w0

My ex and I were enablers of each other, she's not quite as bad as I was, but she refuses to get cleaned up (when I told her alcohol was killing me she replied, ""alcohol gets such a bad reputation because of people like you""...she, of course, said she was joking, but we know she wasn't)....anyway, I guess my point is, I can definitely empathize with you having a partner that is also struggling, and I have the most respect for you for sticking with him through it.

I definitely cried at the rehab part, I never went to rehab, but I've apologized to so many people I care about for my absence over the past decade.

Regarding the shot when she was going on for the encore, that was the only moment in the movie where I really really missed drinking, that was the ""fun"" part of drinking, downing that liquid courage and doing something that you might not have done otherwise...seeing him drink gin rocks was triggery for me, but that shot just looked so appealing to me, it was the only part of the movie I felt even remotely romanticized drinking",9li7w0

It's funny, I haven't seen the movie since I saw it in theaters, want to watch it again but haven't brought myself to....don't know if I'm afraid whether it'll hit me hard again or if I'm afraid it won't hit me hard enough, which sounds silly when I type it out, but it's accurate to how I feel.

I've lost a couple friends since the movie, one to suicide and one to some aggressively assholish cancer...I made it through those and a particularly rough winter and holiday season and came out unscathed.

e8fosba,"I think he was always suicidal, we found that out when he told the story in rehab. And thats when he was 13. I dont think those tendencies ever went away. He was a very haunted man, a lot of demons. Unfortunately, I would hvae liked for the fact of him finding his soulmate in Ally to have helped heal him, but I think it only exacerbated his demons and made him feel even more so that he didn't deserve to be here,with her. Also coupled with the tinnitus---which someone posted a great informational article about it, I had no idea it caused so much mental anguish as well. I think he always knew he would do it, and I think at certain times more than others. He wrote that song for her as his suicide note---and that happened before talking with Rez, before the grammys.   
I recall reading somewhere that a big sign of depression and being suicidal is giving away treasured items, so picking up on this detail I think its HUGE! I totally missed it myself!",9li7w0

e88otfs,"I agree to a point. The manager crossed the line when he told Jack off. You don't do that to someone who just spent time recovering, is obviously susceptible to relapse, had a breakdown, and is unstable. Keep your shitty ""advice"" or ""tough talks"" to yourself. I truly hope he feels responsible for Jack's suicide because in my book he played a huge role in it. ",9li7w0
e77tmh0,Something needed to actually push jack over the edge. Showing her career being affected would have been jarring. So just having an asshole character to say it straight out worked better. ,9li7w0
e7xd47m,"He did all that and yet couldn’t prevent Jackson from hobbling up on stage drunk, potentially ruining Ally’s career. That’s an odd one. Just sat there and watched. ",9li7w0
e7icuji,"I think the manager stripped a lot of what made Jackson fall in love with Ally in order to make her a ""pop star."" I think that's where the hatred first stemmed from and then the 1on1 Jackson talk cemented that. ",9li7w0
e7do39w,"For me when I watch the film I intensely relate to Lady Gaga’s experience. The manger wanted to explode her career and Ally want to help heal Jack.

Where the manger failed is in his greed for her huge success he made the choice for her. He decided Lady Gaga would be better off making it big than supporting Jack. I don’t know what her answer would have been. I don’t know if Jack would have died regardless. I do know that wasn’t up to the manger that was on Lady Gaga.

Oh man artists are a source a money. Most only see the money and what they can get from you. Yes he did well with her career but it was what the manager wanted first and her needs never. He didn’t ask her if that is what she truly wanted.

It kind of bothered me that the brother said it was all Jack responsible for his suicide. That’s a trigger for a lot of people. Yes Jack was physically present when he died. But I feel the depression and addiction took his life. He had played those same notes over and over again. He didn’t have hope. He felt hopeless. And didn’t want to drag Ally down. 

The manger failed Ally and Jack. He presumed Ally’s success was the most important thing. But it turns out I guess Jack agreed with him. But was it Jack or the disease. ",9li7w0
e7uurq6,"He's only right if the objective is to get big and loud. If the objective is for her and her husband to be happy, and for her to make the music she wants to make, he was dead wrong.",9li7w0

e7o321u,"I would’ve loved to see what the original choice, Liotta, could’ve done with it.",9li7w0
e7wty7b,His decisions were about making money. And he was good at it. Jackson viewed being an artist as more than that which is why he had a problem with what Ally was doing. He was afraid of watching Ally lose her voice and essentially herself by trying to fit a mold. That she would see massive short term gain at the cost of long term relevance and influence.,9li7w0
e857f50,"I didn't like early on that he was changing her into a pop star. The hair color change, the switch to back-up dancers rather than a piano. Stuff like that seemed like it implied he also influenced what kinds of songs she was writing.",9li7w0

e7qduz5,I kept wondering WTF were those hanging ropes in the LGBT flag about? Was the movie going to touch on these subjects? Was it some kind of protest by whoever owned the billboard?

As a side note, the sheer amount of unknown actors in that film who went on to be famous is mind boggling.

Even the 70s version, which brought in feminine power as their new addition to the story, had the two leads get into a huge fight while he's drunk and her yelling ""I'm going to kill you!"", and then they fuck right after that 0_o

To me, she thought maybe she'd get the journal bc he dies of an overdose or something but not a direct result of a lifetime of dealing with depression. He kind of opened the door to maybe tell her about it, but he was afraid to just come out and say it.

I think that's what this whole film is about. There's a real reason the story of the fan and the belt is highlighted at the rehab clinic. 

The tragedy, to me, is that Ally was a window to save his life - and she did for a while. I view Jack as someone dealing with a lifelong, deep depression. The drugs and alcohol help him cope/numb it. And, Ally recognizes his alcoholism as a disease. BUT, at least in how I interpreted it, there is one more layer. Depression is the underlying disease, and maybe the alcoholism, itself a disease, is just one of the symptoms.

Ally was always mad he was tanked. But I feel she thought it stopped there. Were she to know why he was drunk (from always being depressed) she wouldn't have responded with anger. She says as much in the movie by dropping her tour without a thought.

To me this movie nails depression and the whole tragedy of it. It can be SO hard for people, even the closest loved ones, to actually know and be able to help.",9li7w0

e8uy17x,"Hi, apologies for the late reply.

Although my boyfriend really liked the movie, I know he doesn't like watching films or TV shows with characters who have tinnitus, because it reminds him of it. He's always tuning it out, trying not to hear it, and the moment you hear it in a movie (like if a character has tinnitus, or after a bomb has gone off) he suddenly can hear his own tinnitus and he hates it.

I'm not sure what he would say about the link between tinnitus and depression/suicide (although I know that there is evidence of a link), and I won't ask him because I know he doesn't like talking about it. He's had depression and suicidal thoughts much longer than he's had tinnitus, so I'm not sure that he could accurately measure the impact tinnitus has had on his mental health. And his entire family are alcoholics, so I'm sure he'd attribute his drinking problem to that, not his tinnitus.

But it's hard to know the truth, because he's very much in denial about his tinnitus, so it's very hard for me to know how bad it is. He pretends he's OK, he goes to raves with no hearing protection (despite me protesting and buying him custom fit earplugs). He acts like it's a minor issue. But I know it's worse than he lets on. We've had huge arguments about the fact that I won't put a TV in my bedroom (he has a TV in his bedroom at home). I've never had a TV in my bedroom, and I don't want one because I have a sleep condition and using a phone/laptop/TV before bed makes sleeping extremely difficult for me. But he hates the silence when he's trying to go to sleep, and even though he doesn't say it, I know it's because of his tinnitus. He often sleeps in the living room just so he can have the TV as background noise.

when he confronts her while shes in the tub and he recites ""why you gotta walk with an ass like that"", or something to that effect, you could see the disappointment. not only in Ally for writing such shit lyrics, but for recognizing that the industry had just gotten its hold of her",9li7w0

It’s not a sadness about the actual movie elements - I can’t relate to basically anything in the movie - but DAMN has it left me feeling so melancholic.

The agent wanted to turn Ally into a run-of-the-mill pop star who'd be mostly forgotten once she reached a certain age. Jack saw the real artist in her and knew she could blow way past that if she got over her insecurities and didn't let that douche control her image. In a way, Jack won out in the end. ",9li7w0

Ally never shows any remorse or regret for that abomination or completely selling her soul. That whole conflict is painted as jealousy from a drunk, when in reality, the songs Ally one a grammy for were far more embarrassing than Jackson pissing himself.

Thats my biggest complaint from the movie is that its all about Jackson's addiction (drugs and alcohol) and completely lets Ally off the hook for hers (fame and acceptance).",9li7w0

Cause I heard someone said it wasn't supposed to be a ''bad pop song'' but instead a ''lighthearted, much less serious one'', but likewise there are much less serious songs that aren't disgustingly bad as this one, in this very same movie Hair Body Face is one

In ''Why Did You Do That'' we end up asking that exact same question to Ally, as not only the heavy departure from her style is shocking, but also a soulless, personality-less waste of her potential and her talent",9li7w0

e7xssqw,I don’t remember that I the movie so I guess it was also cut. ,9li7w0
e9qwzsn,"I've been to see the film four times so far and plan to go again, I was really moved by it on so many levels, I loved Jackson and Ally's chemistry, it was a shame to witness very early on his alcoholism after his show at the beginning of the film when he was being driven away by his chauffeur, I remember Jackson almost plead to his driver when he said, ""I just don't wanna go home"" which made me see that he was very lonely inside.""

I didn't fully understand what Bobby meant when he said that Jackson had stolen his voice but after reading some of the comments on here I get it now. I think like many others that Jackson loathed the fact that Ally was selling her soul for fame, I loved their singing duo's together but it was also clear that his drinking and drug taking was a big issue in their relationship.

For me what really got to Jackson was the fact that with Ally's career taking off it was driving a wedge between them as often is the case with celebrity couples, it was almost as if they were living separate lives, his demise kicked off when Ally told Jackson that she cannot play in Memphis with him because Rez has other plans for her, this is when he get's wasted and ends up at his old time friend's house interestingly Ally says that she won't come and find him again. I thought that the decision to get marriage there and then wasn't their decision but his friend's and I didn't like that and when Bobby got Jackson the gig to play and sing at the Grammy's which at the last minute was given to someone else which meant that Jackson agreed to playing a minor part just playing guitar really got to him hence getting wasted badly, he already knew that was the case because of the rehearsal and was isolating himself whilst Ally was getting made up for her big night so right there he felt like the underdog and maybe subconsciously wanted to sabotage her big night and success?

I seriously don't recall seeing Jackson wetting himself whilst on stage and will be looking out for that next time, the ending was sad but obvious and I keep on wondering how on earth their dog got out at the end as Jackson had definitely closed the patio door? All in all I loved it and can't get the songs out of my head, I could write a lot more but better end it here.",9li7w0

No.  He was just telling Jack how much it had hurt her - in protection of her - and in anger toward Jack for being selfish, which is what he was essentially being.  Many addicts are.  This is why he lost his brother's companionship.  This is actually NOT WHY Jack committed suicide.  

Jack's problems were deeper than her career, which is what his brother said to her.  He had a rough start with no mother and an absent, alcoholic father.  He loved Ally but was co-dependent on her - he was spiraling the drain when he first met her. ",9li7w0

e7c62qn,"My BFF and I of 48 years are die-hard Streisand and Kristofferson fans. We've each watched the 1976 version over 50 times. Both of us had mixed reviews after watching this version (we live in different states so watched separately.)

We each felt that Bradley Cooper was the shining star of this movie. Gaga is getting all the buzz but for us the rawness of Jackson IS this movie for us.

We loved the first portion but had a hard time once Ally went down the popstar road given how much she loved songwriting and loved performing with Jackson on tour. She was such a strong personality in the first part of the movie and it was a bit hard to swallow that she would embrace the pop world. Of course, that's what was hard for Jackson to reconcile too so I get it.

We also both felt that the intense love between Ally and Jackson was not really built up and kind of rushed. And the scene where he first brings her on stage was a bit confusing because how would she know how to sing his version effortlessly... it seems like there may have been a scene prior to that which was cut where they ended up writing full lyrics together the previous night. In the '76 version, the build-up to Esther first performing is slower and more believable. But then I kind of thought that Jackson was so enthralled with her that he felt compelled to bring her up immediately so I was a bit mixed on that aspect.

We both agreed that anyone who hadn't seen the 76 version would really love this version and would probably walk away emotionally devastated...just as we do each time we watch the Esther/John Norman version.

I went into the theater with an open mind and really wanted to have a gut-wrenching reaction. I did cry but not the sobs I anticipated. I also thought a reckless motorcycle ride was going to be his suicide choice. The hanging scene was really tough to watch. My friend didn't cry at all - but to be fair - there were some distractions in the theater for her.

I want to watch the 3.5 hour version that others have mentioned! We'll both definitely watch this version again because we want to take in things we may have missed with being in our heads and kind of comparing each scene with the 76 version. With our emotional ties to the previous version, comparison was inevitable even though I tried to distance myself. 

All in all, it was a damn good movie. I bought the soundtrack immediately after but was a little disappointed with all the dialog on it because I just wanted to listen to the tremendous music.

Fix the terrible way in which his career jumps from ""rockstar"" to ""has-been"" and change the end to one where he cleans up his acts and leaves to be a nobody or one where he actually does something bad enough to make his suicide seem reasonable and the movie would be taken to another level.

Personally I love La La Land but that's primarily due to its music and colour. Yes it's a bit cheesy, but It's an ode to the cinema classics of old like Singing In the Rain. It's also the film that convinced me to start listening to Jazz music since its score was beautiful.so I'm thankful to Chazelle and Hurwitz for that. 

This film is a lot more earthy and darker in it's style of direction, like La La Land meets Inside Llewyn Davis or something. I have yet to watch If Beale Street Could Talk, but I'll definitely watch it as soon as I can, just the musical piece in the trailer justifies a watch.",9li7w0

Like he stopped drinking for her, then when he saw her performing on that show, singing this ""shallow"" song he just open the beer bottle. And also I dont think he was jealous of her, deffinetly not. More like very heartbroken that she wants the approval of all the people. I mean it's not her to blame for him being an alcoholic, but I do feel like she priotirised her career over her husbands alcoholism. Now here is where different opinions come. For some she is not responsible for him and he is a grown-up man and so on. I do feel however, that she kind of neglected him over her career.

About his suicide I really have a hard time being in those people shoes. I just cant imagine what kind of pain and sorrow they feel that they end up their lives. But I do feel that it has something to do that he did not feel loved by anyone anymore. His brother told him its easier without him. His father didnt notice his first suicide attempt.

Then they have a night together and it gives him a little bit of life,and he clings to her hard.

so when he says ‘i just wanna take another look at you” on their first night, its the same as the ending, he wants another moment before he offs himself.thats why he was so shitty and grumpy wanting to know if she was coming, its her or death.

Now to your question, what I understood about the voice thing was this:

Turns out Bobby was a singer as well in his younger days, but his songs were empty or how the movie would say, *shallow,* Bobby probably discarded the objective of sending a message to the audience and instead sought mass appeal (probably to get out his family of poverty as fast as he could, which is understandable af), Jackson disapproved of the way Bobby wrote his songs so he wrote songs for him to sing, songs with a broader and clearer message and ''something to say''

But according to Jackson, Bobby was ''to proud'' to sing the songs he wrote for him, so he ignored Jackson's ideas in order to keep attracting crowd in a simpler way. But Jackson didn't just stay put, Jack got to the point of taking steroids in order to make his voice deeper, with a tone similar to his brother's, so then he could sing the songs he wrote with a ''Bobby-like voice'', thus *''stealing''* Bobby's way of singing (which people liked) but in order to share his feelings with a listening audience, that's what its all about, Jackson literally stole Bobby of not only his voice, but his singing career, as most probably Bobby's career ended when Jackson showed up in the showbiz",9li7w0

Is he supposed to be bitter and self destructive, or just a victim of his addictions? The movie couldn't pick.

I also don't like the film's depiction of the music business. It seriously tries to convince us that lady gaga is somehow unattractive?!? And that she succeeds *despite* the superficialness of the industry, when any normal person would say she is a conventionally attractive woman who owes her success somewhat to that. And the idea that old blues rock stars are the incumbents, and pop princesses are plucky underdogs is exactly the opposite of reality, and it's been like that for decades. The movie thinks about criticising Ally for becoming a pop princess with backing dancers, but then backs down when it realises that that would involve criticising the real life lady gaga. And then in the finale she is a full on pop diva. It never really decides if her ""selling out"" is a sad thing and blames the evil agent, or empowering and to be celebrated and jackson is just bitter.",9li7w0

>  She knows he's an alcoholic and (I think she knows) an addict. She marries him, and then starts questioning his drinking and sloppy behavior?

I think this was a matter of her falling in love with him and being blinded by the love. Being around an alcoholic can be different than living with one. Plus you can delude yourself into thinking ""well, once we're married things will be super great so surely he'll want to quit, there will be no need to drink!"" It's just really easy to minimize alcoholism in someone you love when it's not present right that second.

> - The whole relationship with Jackson and his brother. Why bring up the ""stole my voice"" thing if you're not going to delve into it a little deeper? I'm still not sure exactly where they were going with that. Also, the brother leaves the tour, then a handful of scenes later, he's back in the game. There's a scene where Jackson asks him to come back, he declines, and then he's back in the picture again.

That I took as exploring the matter of envying someone else's success. Originally the brother was the one envying Jackson's success, but then roles were reverse and Jackson was envying Ally's success.

> - This kinda confused me. Jackson's Dad had him when he was, what, 63 or something? But his brother accuses Jackson of being his Dad's drinking buddy? I think I really missed something in this segment.

Jackson was drinking when he was a kid, 11 or 12 or 13 (which is when his father died). 

> - The hearing thing. It's referenced a number of times, but never really explored in any depth.

I got at least two things from it. First, it was something that would increase Jackson's propensity to drink, to try to 'self-medicate' and drown it out. And second, it was something to scare him -- if he loses his hearing, he can't sing, and if he can't sing, what does he (feel like he) have left?",9li7w0

So when Ally starts her pop star journey and getting fame/caught up in the industry, we see her doing trashy pop songs and 'losing herself' - but I think this is just from Jack's perspective and that Ally is still being true to herself for the most part (she wrote the songs, we didn't really see her object to the 'new' direction and we know she can object to it, e.g with the dancers and also not going platinum blonde like the manager wanted).

If the movie had a message then yes I admit fully that I missed it. But reading your post, I'm still not clear on what that message is exactly, sorry. I still doubt there is one.

>Ally falls deeper and deeper into the role of a generic pop star

Is Ally a generic popstar? The movie gives very little info on what her music is about. It's established early on that she writes her own music. This is why Jack falls in love with her, right? That's the _only_ thing I know about her act. I guess I could infer that this is what makes her so successful, but the movie keeps all that stuff vague anyway.

> he doesn't know how else to deal with his disappointment in her and in himself for what he perceives to be a failure to steer her on the right path.

Is that made clear in the film at all? What ""right path"" are you talking about? The only thing I recall is him disapproving is that song about the tight jeans (which I _suppose_ is kind of a vapid thing to sing about). Wasn't he also jealous of her success? As I mentioned before, I really did not get what exactly was contributing to his downward spiral.

>HOWEVER, with his final act on earth, and through Ally's own self-reflection, she finally understands what it means to ""have something to say,""

Ok. So what does it mean? What does she now understand from his ""sacrifice""?

>and with her final performance she shows the world that she is truly a star (I would even argue that the very last shot of Ally is the moment ""a star is born"").

Oh ok so then this is a very cynical movie. In order to be born a star, one must suffer through the suicide of a vulnerable loved one. Yikes!

Edit: I'll be a little more specific, but there's not much I like about it.

Near the beginning, when Jack plays Ally's song: how does he know this song? She roughed out a bit of a verse and a chorus, that's is. Suddenly, it's a fully completed song with music and everything? And her freakout to even get there. She's all about having to work, her boss (understandably) gives her shit for being late, and she flips out and quits? WTF?

And then she goes back to his hotel room, and he's passed the fuck out from drinking, and she decides ""yeah, this is who I want in my life""?

e7nqm3t,"Agreed, and I just don't get what he was holding her back from in his mind? He started drinking again because he believed she had kind of sold out singing garbage pop songs about butts instead of ""letting her voice be heard,"" so I don't understand why he'd be so guilt-ridden about potentially impeding her bubblegum popstar celebrity a bit that he'd decide to kill himself.

If it was a rash decision while drunk I'd get it, but the decision was made while totally sober. If it seemed like she wasn't happy and felt an obligation to him which held her back I'd kinda get it too, but she had just demonstrated that wasn't the case. I just don't understand how he could think, while sober, that hanging himself in the freaking garage for her to find when she comes home from the concert she wanted him to sing at would be the best thing for her in the short or long term.

Honestly it would have hit me a lot harder / felt more tragic if there was a hint that while she loved him, she secretly resented him a bit for holding her career back, which he picks up on and gets wasted over, then dies in a motorcycle accident on his way to see her perform one last time or something.",9li7w0

I don't know if Gaga consciously chose to play it that way or not, but if it was on purpose, then it was AMAZING acting in that scene. There was a TON for Ally that we didn't see leading up to that point, and I really think there is a whole side to her that we really missed out on seeing.

I think the exact same thing can be said about pretty much every drama film?

There are unrelatable things I can't bear with in this film:

* How Jack could have stayed with a Ally, on career ground. Superficial pop stars like Ally are the very type that reckless rock stars like Jack would have despised with a passion. She was no longer the person he first met.

* How Ally could have stayed with Jack, on alcoholic ground. Jack was outright dysfunctional, had serious problems and screwed up on multiple occasions. The idea of love just for love unconditionally presented in this film just seems very unhealthy.

>We don’t need more fucking Hollywood movies that romanticize alcoholism and depression

However, I would like to ask you about this. How do you feel this movie romanticised Jackson's issues? One of the things that I loved about this movie was that it showed the reality of Jackson's substance abuse and alcoholism. So many movies and TV shows either romanticise it, don't mention it (like the fact that the main character in Scandal literally lived on wine but her addiction was never addressed), or play it for comedy. There were so many scenes where it showed what a huge problem Jackson's substance abuse problems were, and it could have been played comedically but it wasn't. The Grammy awards scene being the most obvious. That scene could have been directed/edited in a way that was intended to make the audience laugh, but it wasn't, it just made you cringe into your seat and want to cry for Ally. Another example is the scene where he fell off the sofa and Ally said ""Oh don't worry, he does that all the time"" with such a dead, tired tone. The fall could have been played for laughs, but it was meant to show how tired Ally was of being constantly embarrassed by Jackson, and constantly having to look after him. The scene where Ally was in the bathtub and he said such horrible things to her that he didn't mean. That showed how brutally mean alcoholics can be to the people they love when they're drunk. I would be really interested to hear how you felt the movie romanticised Jackson's issues, because the fact that it didn't (in my opinion) was one of the reasons I loved it.",9li7w0
e795bym,"And Sam Elliot’s speech about how it was all his fault only.

efw9slx," Glad I’m not the only one! Yes, Gaga and Bradley Cooper were incredible. I know that this movie has been remade several times, and there is a problem with older movies not having a plot. That’s how I felt about this movie. It’s called A Star is Born. Shouldn’t the plot revolve around Ally becoming a popstar and all the trials and tribulations that come with stardom? The plot was Jack being an alcoholic. That’s where all the conflict was. The whole movie was about him. It should’ve been about her. 

This story just didn’t age well and shouldn’t have been remade. I’m sure Bradley Cooper wanted to keep true to the original. Being completely oblivious of your husband’s drinking problem made sense in the 30s. The original involved the leading woman giving up her career to devote herself to her alcoholic husband, and him committing suicide to prevent that from happening. Pretty identical to the 2018 version. I guess that was “romantic” back in the day, but today it just makes for a senseless and unfulfilling ending. Ally was screwed either way, and it sickened me that people fawned over Jack’s suicide being a loving act to give Ally her career back. That’s fucked up.",9li7w0

I didn’t mind the performance at all but his look/accent was way more stereotypical than any of the actual material, other than maybe his last scene with Jackson.",9li7w0
e7ikl3l,"In the philosophy of the film though he's a major villain.

Jackson meets Ally and tells her he wants her to find her voice and amplify it. The movie goes through great lengths to put songwriters and storytellers, genuine artists, on a pedestal. It argues that if you can package it correctly, any story will be heard and embraced.

The manager gives her fame but at the cost of her love and her songwriting agency. Fuck he even talks her into dying her hair when she says she doesn't want to. And his manipulation, as business-savy as it may be, can be directly blamed (despite Bobby and Ally's conversation, neither of whom where privy to that last talk between Jack and the manager) for the suicide at the end.",9li7w0
e8x22kc,"I agree with you, I thought one of the best parts was that the manager was not some cartoonish villain suit. He was respectful and nice on the surface to Jack but like any of us would in that situation resented how much of a fuck up Jack was. Not sure what else people wanted out of the manager.",9li7w0
e8797al,"agree, dude was just doing his job. and doing it extremely well. it's not like he was the classic snake manager. he had his clients' best interest in mind at all times and that's how managers should be.",9li7w0
e7do4y8,That manger decided for Lady Gaga he had the right to decided for Ally how she wanted to proceed. He had zero rights. ,9li7w0
e7e1rdu,"The biggest frustration I had with the movie is how little anyone else did to help Jack. The signs were clear. Everyone knew how much he drank. Everyone knew he needed help. I understand it was a conversation on entertainer culture, that drugs and alcohol are all just a part of it. I know most of the people we listen to on the radio use substances, and I’ve heard many mention that it calms their nerves. But Jackson clearly was using it excessively. Not even Ally really tried to stop him. 

The manager was a total jerk because he was the final straw. You don’t tell an alcoholic that they are going to fail again and they are the reason the woman they love might suffer. I understand that maybe, Jackson never told anyone other than Ally that she was his everything and that she was the first person to give him a home, but his adoration for her was clear. The manager was just selfish and stupid to forget how human beings are. 

But it was Jackson’s fault. Yes, his brother could talk to him. Yes, Ally should not have lied to him. Everyone should have tried helping him more. But it was Jackson’s decision. I absolutely hate that no one really helped him, but it was his fault, and I hope the message reached out to an adult audience. I often see people my parent’s age (I’m in my mid twenties) fighting against feelings of depression and anxiety and they think they can fight it alone. They don’t want to ask for help. And they think all of those feelings get better with time when they talk to younger people going through hard times. Illnesses sometimes never go away. Often, they stay and constantly have to be maintained and given attention to. I hope some people realize that through this movie.",9li7w0

e8tjnvl,"I think this is deliberately overlooking how difficult it is to build and maintain a steady career in showbiz. Selling out is a sucky concept but the industry is cutthroat too. She can strike out as her own pop star or forever be known as ""Jackson's wife who did that one comeback hit of his"". ",9li7w0
e7jrvah,"That was my only real complaint with the movie. The jump from Ally writing ""soulful"" to ""soulless"" music was just too fast. It literally cuts from her performing a beautiful song on stage to her at dance rehearsals for her pop record. I feel even one quick scene could have been added with Ally's management pulling her in that direction, her resistance and then her eventual acceptance (perhaps Jack being encouraged to leave the studio).

I feel the script needed her to be a sellout so she was a sellout. The reasoning of her feeling she was beautiful enough to be a pop star was waiting to be used but she still seemed very humble and grounded throughout her rise to fame. She never developed any sort of ego at all. Even at her photoshoot she didn't identify with the images she was seeing.

I understand it was a long movie and they probably hoped we'd just fill in the blanks of a cliche story point but I think for this calibre of film the character deserved more than - She makes trash pop music now K!

I think the angle of her believing she was beautiful would have made the ugly comment in the bath scene much more devastating. The world is telling you you're beautiful but the one person you care about most thinks you're ugly.",9li7w0

e7fkwf5,"Yes it’s true.

Even with acting too. Look at when heath ledger died. I was on set when I got the call. I only heard “man sad he took his life” and “how selfish.” Lost my shit. How about do not give a man who everyone fucking knew was suffering from depression a role that drives men crazy. Jack even tried to warned people about it. The press made it seem like Jack was being funny. He wasn’t. He was worried. That industry killed him just as much as Jack was killed by industry in that film. They kept him on stage, gave him zero idea there is a life outside of music. Instead of trying to get him to work more with a hearing problem they should have encouraged him to find joy in life. But they wanted his money. And that manger did give two shits about Ally. He wanted success in his career through Ally’s success. So he told Jack to go away. And Jack did. That manger made the choice for Ally whether she wanted fame or a peaceful life for her and Jack. Who knows what she would have chosen. But the manger shouldn’t have made that choice. 

And if you wonder why celebrity marriage fall pay close ducking attention. Because so many idiots are in your marriage in Hollywood and celebrity life. They try and make choices for you. And they are not to be trusted. Mangers have done shit like that for years. Including saying “oh you can go to rehab later, strike well you are hot.” “Oh don’t worry your wife won’t leave you, just do one more project then take a family trip.” No joke.

Yes ultimately we are responsible for our own actions. But you bet your bottom dollar when people only want what you can do for them. You get lost easily. 

He needed a break not a ducking insane character to get lost on. They knew how much he committed to roles. They knew he was on pills, duck sorry. ",9li7w0

The guy pissed himself onstage while his client received her first Grammy. From his perspective, he was being blunt and brutally honest. A basic, “WTF mate, clean up your act you inconsiderate asshole” talk.

e7hpvym,"Just a counterpoint: Gaga has always wanted to be an actress and theater star, not a musician. There are interviews where she says  it was easier for her to become a pop star (her ""backup career"") so she settled for that.

e88kq5d,"This is what wrecked me. That scene at rehab when he tries so hard to communicate to her how he feels. 

Talking about this darkness that's killing you from the inside out is incredibly difficult. That scene, and Brad's acting (though I very much believe he knows personally what it feels like based on that performance, damn) absolutely nailed it. 

It's hard to talk about, because it's hard to understand for the person going through it as well as the people around them, but it is precisely WHY I believe in talking about it. 

This movie man... ",9li7w0
e7bslu2,"Jackson’s childhood sounded horrific as well and that made me feel so much for him. No mom and being in such a low place to attempt suicide at 12??  It explains so many of the demons he was facing as an adult.  Then we know his love for music was being stripped away due to those hearing issues. I wish he shared more with Ally about that. 
I also want to rewatch to watch for more of the subtle points. Problem is it was just so emotional and I feel so heavy at the moment. It’s going to take a while before I can handle it. ",9li7w0

e7cqbu8,"No need to be sorry. I mean, I’m sorry it happened too, but please don’t feel sorry for me. I thought it was a really good film.  I’ve debated actually seeing it again. 
While I knew he [Cooper] had just killed himself, I didn’t even know he hanged himself until the car ride home. I was talking to my friend in the Jeep on the way home and she mentioned hanging, I was like “WTF are you talking about?”  Apparently I was ugly crying so badly and had projected so much of my own situation onto the film that I didn’t even notice a hanging scene. I saw him give the dog some prime meat and then started losing it. Saw the dog outside and then the police lights, but never saw any hanging.  
I haven’t slept more than 45 minutes straight since I saw the film. I keep having these awful, awful dreams and wake up in a panic. My Fitbit says my waking heart rate is always over 110. That’s even with having to take something to help me sleep the past two nights
It will get better, as it did in the past after all of this happened. Last week was the 7 year anniversary of his death, and it seems more real to me now than it has in the past 6 years, but I think that speaks to the storytelling done by Cooper. If he can still evoke these emotions that have been dormant for some time, he did an exceptional job. 
I just hope my niece stays away from the film. I didn’t have a Key to my brothers house. I needed hers to get in and look for any clues of what he mights have been up to when we found him. In prior military so I have definitely smelled that smell before. I immediately knew not to let her cross the threshold into his bedroom. 
She never went in, even after the came and were taking samples and asking insane questions. I’m actually a little proud that I held her back from all of that, as it has obviously fucked me up to a degree. 
I’m there’s obviously so much more to the story, but I’ll leave it at that.  Again, please don’t feel sorry for me. All I ask is that if you ever notice something odd, or way out of character with your loved ones... Say something... do something. 
Maybe you can’t prevent anything, but let them know you care. That’s my biggest regret. 
I was supposed to have lunch with my brother just days before he killed himself. 
I showed up to the god damned wrong restaurant. He called me after a little bit and said we’d reschedule...  
That obviously never happened, and it kills me. Maybe if I was at the right place he would have said something that clued me in?  Maybe I could have talked him down?  
I don’t know. Maybe it sounds ridiculous. 
All I know is that the movie awoke a lot in me, and that’s what a good film does. I do hope Cooper does get some recognition for this come Award season. ",9li7w0

e79diia,"that wasn't jealously that was him feeling uncomfortable with the direction Ally had taken. She had deviated from being her ""true authentic self"" which was what he had tried to nurture from the outset. Hence, the last performance Ally has her natural brunette hair again. ",9li7w0
e79aexk,"Eh I think Ally was spot on when she smeared cake in Jack's face, he was jealous pretty much right away. I think he was also wary of the manager because Jack was familiar with how people like him are in the music industry, so he was worried about her changing as soon as he came into the picture.

e79a1lo,That song was terrible. How it made her a huge star is beyond me.,9li7w0
e8tlb8m,"She's allowed to like pop music lmao 

Gaga came up with the same criticism, people saying she was a Real Artist who shouldn't be doing pop. She had to explain she loves pop like any other genre.

Him getting shitty and calling her ugly because she became a pop star is the height of jealous and immaturity.",9li7w0
ec83x0h,+1. The pop songs she was singing sounded like complete garbage to me and I think they were supposed to sound like trash to the movie audience compared to her other performances with Cooper. ,9li7w0
ehrhohs,"I think you can express disagreement with me without undermining what is a total stranger's understanding of something as personal as mental illness/struggle. I have depression, was diagnosed with it. He had severe addiction mentality *mixed in with* his depression, which changes things a bit. He was addicted to fame, validation, music, love and drugs/alcohol. On top of THAT he was a classic man's man in every sense so throw some ego, pride, entitlement, stoicism and a dash of default misogyny (dismissing a woman's music because it's not to his taste, the obsession with her nose/body and his validation of it, then switching to calling her ugly when he's mad/jealous, being jealous of her fame etc) in on top of everything else I mentioned, too. Add in fear of aging, fear of his Moment being over, familial trauma (still ongoing throughout the film as he clashes with his bro and disappoints Ally's dad) etc x 100000. 

The mess with him is multi-layered. It's never just one thing, it's ALL of these things working to bring him down all at once.

So he eventually felt that suicide was his way of getting out of *her* way. On my second view I actually caught that his insecurity about coming back into her life starts when *she* says ""Do you want to come back?"". That's where his panic begins, not when the manager sinks his teeth in. He keeps asking her ""Why...wouldn't I come back?"" because to him it was a no-brainer they'd remain together. When she asks, he wonders if *she* wants him back at all. Then the manager ""confirms"" it with his awful speech. And she then says she's cancelling her tour (later revealing that was a lie, which he seemed to be aware of...). They used incorrect, non-careful language around someone in a highly vulnerable state and, without even knowing, it pushed him back into toxic thinking of ""I have to destroy myself/take myself down/out of the picture for love"". Whether it be familial love (his dad not even noticing when he tried to hang himself) or romantic love. 

> He wanted he to be true and honest with herself (which he stated multiple times, something a jealous person would not do), and when he called her ugly, he meant that the path she was taking was not genuine.

He doesn't actually have the *right* to tell a person what is and isn't genuine to them, though. Like it's the same debate with Lady Gaga herself. People see a meat dress and go ""You attention seeking idiot"" but for her it was a [political statement](http://www.justjared.com/2010/09/13/meat-dress-lady-gaga/). People saw all her wacky weirdness and dismissed it as pop vapidness but to her it was artistic self expression. His thinking that he can tell her what is and isn't genuine about her career/music, is part of the problem, because she's obviously not going to take that sitting down, so it caused more friction between them. Amongst his pre-existing issues. 

She had to essentially make the type of music HE made, tour the way HE toured and perform in that raw/sweaty country-rock mode HE did, otherwise she ""wasn't being genuine"". That's not fair to her. He realised he's not being fair to her but his depression takes that realisation and turns it into destructive thinking instead of,say, just breaking up or trying to heal. 

[Also as a mildly related aside, it's kind of a fault with the script too, but he says she needs to 'have something to say"" when neither his music featured, nor the film itself, actually puts any big Message forward. Shallow is just them contemplating one another's mindset about life. There's no point where Jackson's other music is shown to have this massively meaningful message that Ally's somehow doesn't. Even Ally's final song is just a personal ode to their love, it's not a Message Song as such. It's an oversight of the film as well as Jackson himself (and Bradley's directing, to not showcase what Jackson's whole music/image/iconography as a superstar entails)]",9li7w0

At first I thought that was a gun but pliers make more sense. I think the shot lingering was intended for us to hold our breath (I know I did) as we watch him slowly take his hat off for the last time. I read somewhere that when Jack is at his most vulnerable, he takes his hat off. This is obviously one of those moments. The article also mentioned that most country singers perform with their hats on, but Jack always takes it off before he sings, because his songs are where he is most vulnerable...",9li7w0

Most A-list actresses that would otherwise play that character well (Jennifer Lawrence, Anne Hathaway, etc.) wouldn't be able to pull off the performing, and the entire film would have fallen flat. Maybe someone with extensive musical theatre background could have done it, but singing show tunes is a very different skill than singing rock/pop.

Again with the caveat that it's early, I think she's a real threat to win too. Who are the other actresses that have been as buzzed about this season so far, Glenn Close & Olivia Colman? The Wife doesn't have nearly as much momentum as ASIB (reasonably likely Close could be the only nom from it) and there's a good chance they run Colman as Supporting to max her chances of winning.

One of the things that made him originally fall in love with her was her beautiful songwriting so to see her become just another pop artist very seriously dissapointed him. The repeating of ""why'd you do that to me"" kinda emphasize his feelings and the audience's feelings of ""how could they do that to her?""",9li7w0

The song itself is the proof you are looking for, stupid lyrics that repeats a thousand times and boring trendy beats, isn't that enough to prove that this is intended to be a bad song?

You can surmise from the movie yourself that it was a downgrade from her first songs, but you’re right that it’s a weak point. If they didn’t have time, they could’ve just made it a song we already know that she performed on SNL. They had her go against the standard by dyeing her hair red(ish), but then she went for it too with that song. I dunno, definitely a weak point like you said.

She did not want to become some generic pop star. She wanted to do the pop music but with her normal image and no back up dancers etc. She did do that one performance where she didnt allow the dancers with her but her manager got mad cause he knows what hes doing so from there on out she did whatever he said, including change her physical appearance. But we never saw the struggle again. We did see her hiding in the bathroom after she changed her look and her friend told her she looked so good so she got confident. After that she became the generic popstar she didnt want to. A sellout. Probably part of why Jack hated it.

efnh74z,"I don't even think they had to make it seem like killing himself was one of the only options left (obvs., there are always other options and suicide is always irrational 99.9% of the time).  Just make the impact more than surface humiliation in how he hurts his loved ones and perhaps combine it with more severe medical/addiction issues, and the viewer would be more able to understand ""why"" he felt like that was his best choice, even if he was wrong. The way they transitioned to the suicide was jarring, and hard for the viewer to grasp what drove him to that point. Also, instead of his brother telling her it was Jackson's fault and not her fault...he could have framed it more like ""he was ill and wasn't thinking straight, it was ultimately his choice and you aren't to blame"" instead of making suicide about ""fault"".  

But yeah, considering all the previous versions end with him dead I think it would have been an interesting twist to basically have him seem at peace with becoming a nobody and staying or leaving Ally.  

I do think La La Land is technically a great film and the use of color is beautiful (and the pacing is good, too, along with the ending). I'm just annoyed with Chazelle's habit of making white boys the jazz prodigies in both Whiplash and La La Land and kind of ignoring the Black origins of jazz, and Ryan's character ""lecturing"" John Legend, a Black man, on real music (cringe). Interestingly, supposedly Michael B. Jordan was Chazelle's initial pick to play Ryan's role, which I think would have made that John Legend interaction way less cringe worthy. TBF, if I hadn't seen Whiplash right before La La Land I probably wouldn't have been so annoyed...it was that Chazelle did it not once, but twice, that kind of got to me so I went in with some preconceived notions and then had them met...

I am glad though that it introduced you to jazz! Anytime films introduce people to new things or get them hooked on something new, I find it fantastic...especially as someone who also loves jazz.

If Beale Street Could Talk is fantastic. Truly do not understand how it isn't getting more buzz considering it received way more raves than Vice and Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody and even ASIB.  there's very much a Wong Kar-Wai vibe, too, and the music is amazing. If you follow Barry Jenkins on twitter, he talks a lot about music which is kind of interesting.  Highly recommend you check it out when you get a chance.

(Though she shouldn't have been surprised about the cheating since they both cheated on people to be together in the first place.)

2) When they split up, he sabotaged her career. From an [LA Times article](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-25/news/mn-47374_1_eastwood-wanted-locke):

> During the trial, Locke alleged that Eastwood had duped her into dropping her 1989 palimony suit by dangling a bogus three-year development deal to direct at Warner Bros. Before the split, she'd directed two pictures to critical acclaim. But after the deal, she pitched more than 30 projects; Warner Bros. rejected them all.

And he did kind of fix those issues with his next films...

 A close relative of mine worked behind the scenes on the 1970s film with Streisand and Kristofferson (the one that was truly terrible lol) so I read several reviews before and after seeing the film and I was very curious to see how this version turned out.

&#x200B;

That being said, the other bathtub scene where she fights with Jack about her song on SNL, you can see she's defending her work here, but I think it's simply because it's HER work and HER lyrics. Deep down, I don't think she liked it. That's how I see it.",9li7w0

e78q2m5,Agreed.,9li7w0
e7edu96,"I left feeling the same way, I hate that they completely followed the old version ending, especially in today's day and age with how we as a society are trying to combat suicide. 

I saw it yesterday and I've been ripped up, I cannot stop thinking about the movie and I have to keep reminding myself that Bradley Cooper is alive and Lady Gaga is not in mourning. I feel like their love story was too powerful to have an ending like that.  Especially because there is a real life example of it working out with Johnny Cash. He also had a very rough childhood that haunted him throughout his life, got him addicted and almost ruined his career, but he survived.

&#x200B;

I think it would have been a better ending if they would have shown him attempting suicide, like they can allow him to get to that point, but instead of him following through on it, Ally, (who should have called to check and make sure he was still coming, and possibly find out that he is not answering) call the brother and have him check in on Jackson, who pulls up right as Jackson drops from the ceiling, and then getting him down before the damage is done. Then you cut back to lady gaga at the concert thanking her husband, and then the next scene is a dark fade into a hospital with Jackson breathing through a machine and Ally rubbing his hair, singing his song to him. He then wakes up, they have their moment and what not, and then they let some time pass, he comes home again, she has now started prepping for her next album, dropped that sorry ass Manager who had her sell out, and instead she realizes it is time to get back to her roots, back to what Jackson believed in her and showed to her what was beautiful about her voice, and she gets a publicist who gets them interviews about recovery and redemption for Jackson and they work on the album together as a form of recovery for him as well like Johnny Cash did with his wife, and BOOM. The love stays strong but it remains real. She isn't mourning. 

&#x200B;

I get that they have to show that they can't save everyone but the suicide was just too heart breaking for me, and I wish it could have ended differently. I'm probably being too emotional myself, hence my obsession with writing a new ending instead of accepting what was. Heck, they could of had him be disabled from the suicide which would still fulfill the loss element, but death was pretty hard for me to personally swallow, I wanted to believe that it would all work out, that their love, no matter what, would pull them through.

I got the impression that he was passed out right outside Chapelle's house, although they don't make that clear. He mumbles something about ""thinking he made it to the door"".

That's a key facet of a musical, I feel the 1954 one is more a drama. This had some catchy songs so it excels there. Interesting cinematography too. Editing could be better, but can't complain.




Would have liked Gaga to say ""I am Mrs. Jackson Maine"" after the song and then cut to black but the flashback was quite the killer. Cooper nailed the role, none of Mason's ""Mason-ness"" but Norman was a whimsical charming actor on the decline. Jackson was a gritty man with demons so the performance mirrored that.

And the ass song does seem purposefully bad, especially when we know Warren and Lady Gaga can write good pop, even if Warren defended the song.

e7fb9z3,"You didn’t notice the change in her music from the start of the movie til the end? Her performance on SNL can act as a perfect finale to her change, she sounded nothing like her original voice and was dancing more than singing. Jack’s struggle is that he never intended for her to get lost in the music business, as she did. 

The right path he meant for was for her to not get lost in this, which was his selfish downfall. He wanted her to be his performing partner, but he also understood how the stardom could change someone so he just let it happen. He was jealous of her success because he, to an extent, didn’t go as far down that path. 

With regards to his final act, he sent her the message that she shouldn’t sell herself out, as she admitted multiple times that she had. This finally gave her the courage to focus on her voice and not be a pop star molded by a top music producer. 

And no, in order to be a star, one doesn’t need to feel full sacrifice. The larger message is that he had serious drug and alcohol problems, tried to overcome them, but the music industry (aka ally’s producer) brought him to realize she lost herself instead of letting her voice truly shine and her her own, so he showed her how to let go of that.

I understand being afraid to broach the subject if you have before and he took it badly. Also, if she didn’t wanna address the symptom (alcohol and drug abuse), why not try to help with the cause?

That also looked awkward since Lady Gaga is not that young or stunning, yet in-movie producer decides to make some kind of Beyonce/Nicki Minaj/Ariana Grande out of her instead of making her kind of Alanis Morissete woman with a guitar.

Was she giving up on her dreams to write her own music and stay true to herself? Or was being run-of-the-mill booty shaking pop-star satisfying enough for her? That moment where she hit some dude in a bar, what did it mean? They never actually made any scenes where that side of her character is shown.

Also, Cooper's drinking, did he drink because of his dad? Or because he was getting deaf? Or because his career was going down hill? Like he didn't really seem to be bothered with going deaf to me, instead he just kept on pounding pills and alcohol and being an asshole selfish addict till the very end.

She goes from selling her labor to someone who owns the means of production, to being totally free with Jackson, to selling her labor again to someone who owns the means of production. She butts horns with this new boss just like her old one, and he eventually drives her husband to suicide.

To the extent that the movie says something about capitalism, it's a pretty negative view. Her self esteem issues go hand in hand with her being someone's employee. The arc of her story is like a breaching whale in the ocean of capitalist misery. Being rich does not free her from this misery.

Read some of the other comments - people who attempted suicide or the likes really relate to his character.

I think what this movie does instead of simply offering a path of redemption to Jackson is show how flawed the music world is that it portrays how the manager thinks about Ally's image so much he forgets Jackson is human. 

This movie shows an example of things gone wrong and can start a conversation about how they might have gone right - especially considering he *was* on a path of recovery before the *music business* came back, stabbed him and twisted the knife.",9li7w0

The manager was just doing his job. I love that he was written like that and not like John Legends character in La La Land.

I mean, Ally was in a very uncertain place... she enters the industry and is completely in awe of and beholden to Jack, even as she is rising to stardom she's obviously still hoping for his approval and input. Forcing someone to confront their alcoholism would be a hard enough topic for someone to navigate without being a newlywed and being under their musical wing, so to speak.

I have seen the industry of celebrity work against a suffer of mental illness to even put the final dose of drugs in their veins. 

They want them working and making money for the leeches who survive off of them. When you take someone and never give back, you are a leech. If you work in the industry and only care about dollars you are in fact a leech. 

Want to hear a fun fact that most celebrities will agree to, their direct support staff (makeup, hair, house cleaner, assistant, driver) is usually the most loyal to the celebrity themselves. I believe it is because they do not have money and fame and can see the value in living a every day life. They also see the celebrity as human raw and exposed. Want to hear a celebrity get humbled fast? Listen to the quick teasing humour of their support staff. 

Jack had very few who saw him as a person. He had loved ones who cared but were enablers. He had people who needed his money. But there was a few who wanted him well. What jack and they didn’t encourage is to prepare Jack for life after music. And this happens in real life. It’s why so many celebrities work until they are dead. They needed to force him to have downtown to see he could find joy outside of music. He could have quit if he had hope. Instead he drank all the time and hide away from his fears. And they threw him on stage. 

That’s how celebrity culture fails celebrities. They work them to death and suck them dry. I’d love to call out evil people who told now dead celebrities to “just take one more project then go to rehab” and “your wife and kids will be there when you get back, just one more press tour, oh and one more movie.” 

Yes you own your life. But in a pool of leeches you will eventually run dry with not have much left for healing yourself. 

Jack didn’t kill himself, his disease did. He had no hope. And the manager made the choice his life was worth less than Ally’s career. That was ally’s choice. And I see people in the industry do this daily. He could have been given time to find a life outside of the music and the bottle. Maybe a ranch. He could have lived a happy life as a deaf man. 

Look how they killed Whitney and Jackson. I will never forgive them for health ledger. Or the celebrities who died cause of pedophiles and denial.

Fuck all you leeches. Wow getting worked up. When a celebrity dies from suicide or OD sometimes the world is shocked. Like didn’t know it was that bad. Or didn’t know he or she was sad at all. But the leeches that surrounded were not surprise at all. The ones that could have done something and didn’t.

[Her talking about the point of the Fame, at age 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPGwSgfGBB8) The point was to bring back dedication to pop, which was something that was lost back in 2008 (and feels that way now, too), to make music that made you feel ""famous"" and powerful - and that's exactly what she did.

Then there's MK,  17.  That fucking song makes this 60 year old feel like he's young again. Can't help but get up and move!  :-)  I also love the video and the choreography.  The dancing is far from perfect, but that's the point -- it has that spontaneous and organic feel to it that makes you want to get up and dance yourself.

They were sitting outside talking about Jack's tinnitus and then his dad's alcoholism. Jack said he tried to hang himself from the ceiling fan at 13 and the fan fell down. He said he was more upset about the scratches on his face than failing his suicide attempt, and that his dad was such a drunk that he didn't notice any of it at all. The ceiling fan sat on the floor for six months. ",9li7w0

Regardless of whether people will vote for her, Lady Gaga in the running is a goldmine for them to try to get younger viewers to tune in and watch and I think her story is going to be in everybody's faces leading up to it to publicize the event.

Personally I think this one will destroy at the Oscars...accessible so all voters will see it?  Check.  About fame/Hollywood?  Check (the Academy LOVES movies about Hollywood, the celebrity voting members will likely love this film because they'll view it more personally with regards to their own rise to fame and struggles with celebrity, and the last movie I know of to feature the Chateau Marmont as a set piece was La La Land...).  Critically acclaimed with outstanding performances?  Check.  Nice feel-good story arcs (Bradley's first directing job!  Gaga's first movie!) for celebrities that are generally well liked amongst their peers?  Check.

The final scene was such a waste. Rather than have her do yet ANOTHER ego stroking performance (the whole ""i can get through this if you help me"" aka clap and cheer for me as i do this intimate performance in front of everyone for attention), the final scene should have been her performing that song in a bar or something, getting back to her roots. That final scene was so obnoxious to me.

ehxbyv6,"Yeah that's fair. Just to elaborate more on my point since I'm still mulling over my viewing from last night.

I think what really disconnected me from Ally's character is that I'm not sure what her motivation was. Did she want to be a superstar regardless of what it took or how much of her artistic integrity she had to sacrifice? I never got that impression, especially after all her back and forth with Jack about having something to say. So it didn't really make a lot of sense to me.",9li7w0

The song is about how he will NEVER LOVE AGAIN / never again give his heart to a stranger, yes.  but he DED.

She ""has to"" perform this song, in front of an audience full of famous people and luminaries. 

The scene requires she sing this song with twenty four buckets of emotion, holding back tears which inevitably should come spewing out of her as she continues to sing. 

Instead, she kinda sings the song with a bit of a smile on her face.

I know part of being a Star is letting people see your beautiful teeth, but there was something off about the ""emo"" of the scene.  **She should be a wreck** ---- yet ALSO able to sing.",9li7w0

But, yeah, I could definitely see Glenn Close winning.",9li7w0

efni38o,"Agreed entirely, the movie just switched gears from the moment Ally met Rez, and then rushed itself towards to conclusion. But given that it's Bradley's first direction ever I'll give him props for doing such a great job. Though I definitely don't want it to take the Oscar for best picture. I have yet to watch Blackkansman, IBSCT, Roma or Green Book, but will definitely check them all out before the Oscars. Currently my favourite for the seats is Bohemian Rhapsody.

Before La La Land I knew ""In A Sentimental Mood"" and 1-2 other songs. Now I have a good collection of 80-90 jazz tracks, from Miles Davis and Dave Brubeck to Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz. Though I do get the argument about ignoring the contribution of Black artists towards to genre and it's rise.

e7ehui9,"As sweet of an ending as this would be, this isn't actually a love story. This is the story of how Ally reaches her stardom. Jack's suicide (as sad as it is) serves a purpose: to stop holding back Ally's career, but more importantly, to allow her to understand what it means to have something important to say (which she shows us in her final performance).

Of course, one could argue that he could have achieved these goals without killing himself, but anything less than his death would probably still hold her back. ",9li7w0

I personally lost my father to substance abuse, and would love to have seen a more optimistic outcome to this story.  That doesn't mean I needed a happy ending.  There are many ways to have her sing with purpose without him dying.  I may have even taken an accidental death (likely overdose) because then her singing at the end can be seen as a silver lining.  But to me the thought that he killed himself to help her career is like trading a Lamborghini for a bicycle.  She would almost certainly take 10 more minutes with him over having a career in singing.

&#x200B;

When Gaga was getting ready to film the final scene of *A Star Is Born*, where she sings ""I'll Never Love Again"", the singer got a telephone call that her childhood friend Sonja Durham was in her last moments of [Stage IV cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging). Gaga left the set and drove to meet Durham, but she was late by ten minutes after her friend passed away. Durham's husband consoled her and asked to return for filming. The singer recalled that ""\[Sonja\] gave me a tragic gift that day and I took it with me to set, and I sang that song for Jackson and for her on that very same day within an hour."" Co-star Bradley Cooper was supportive about Gaga's loss but Gaga was adamant in finishing the scene. So she stepped on the set and sang ""I'll Never Love Again"".

He needed someone to teach him how to be happy once he was deaf and couldn’t have music anymore. They spent too much wasted time sucking him dry. I think the brother was just as broken and was his most unhealthiest enabler. Sam Eliot’s character did everything out of guilt. Bad motivation. Sam thought he needed music to survive so tried to get him to hear with plugs. His friends pointed out Ally was his chance at happiness. And that did put a lot of pressure on Ally. She was the people who enabled him’s scapegoat. 

He needed to love life sober and deaf. And he wasn’t given any time to find it. And he was hopeless. And the final straw was the manger deciding for Ally that ally wanted a career more than Jack. Maybe that would have happened to jack. But for jack standing on the cusp of suicide or not, it broke him to feel he would only drag ally down. And ally couldn’t share what she really wanted cause she didn’t even let jack make the choice. She decided for him. When you feel like you have zero control. You can’t see the light, he was in the darkness of suicidal thought and he went there quick and swiftly. That song to ally was his suicide note and he didn’t even realize. He probably realized hanging their dying. And Ally probably realized singing that song in front of everyone. He died believing it was so she could be heard. Depression took his life.

Because this suicide should never be a sacrifice and Jack should never be deemed as a hero.

The tone of the movie will be so wrong if that's the case, a suicide = an honor sacrifice???

No, the suicide is a depiction of Jack's worsening alcoholism leading him to his own demise. Ally is well capable of making her own decision and getting back to her roots does not necessarily mean the ""right"" thing she needs to do. We as the audience adores her before Rez has made her into this pop star, but our opinion doesn't matter, what matters is how truthful this movie is to show its audience the reality, because this is what basically happens everyday in the music industry nowadays.

In addition Ally never liked what Rez has made her into, there's no doubt she will go back to make the music she enjoys singing, in fact her hair color during the last scene already implys that.

e7hy48a,"not a formally trained musician myself, but from what i've seen, there's a lot of reverence for past composer's work in classical music. there's still loads of original music being created though. steve reich and philip glass come readily to mind. the challenge of preforming their music particularly might be more wound into the repetition and subtle changes in melodies and rhythms recurring for long periods of time.  

i.e.

[knee play 3 - glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL9Rjn7EiRw)

&#x200B;

i guess you're specifically addressing that many classical players aren't creating their own music. i'm far from a scholar of modern classical tunes but i know there are many instrumentalists who do. reich is a trained drummer and glass a fantastic pianist. ([glass live (on piano)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q0G0-9E5SE)). 

&#x200B;

there's undeniably a lot of musical proficiency in a number of metal bands. i'm sure it also often requires inhuman stamina to preform live (drumming, especially). and ultimately, perception of talent is subjective. there's no way to conclusively measure it. but i just can't get jiggy with the idea of metal being more technically demanding than complex jazz or microtonal compositions for string instruments ([johnston's microtonal amazing grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4MkJXXMBAw)).

Like I understand the purpose of what they were trying to say with his suicide, and I’m glad they addressed these points and brought the issue to light, but excuse me if I would of rather had a more optimistic ending. Like I love dark movies that touch on heavy subjects and maybe I saw this movie at the wrong time in my own life to where I took it a little too hard, but I would have rather walked out feeling a little optimistic about life rather than almost hopeless.

ebnmwz8,"Well I think there's a reason why Jackson left the ranch to Bobby, and while Jack truly admired his brother and not his father, I think he did give a shit about the ranch and lemme explain why

In the film, Bobby represented order, decency and a voice of reason for Jack, whose alcoholism and drug addiction, alongside his incurable tinnitus interfered with his life and interactions with people

So that's why he left the ranch to Bobby, as Jack's depression made him feel he fucked up everything he touched, he left the ranch in the hands of Bobby cause Bobby knew how to deal with people, situations and had an overall clearer mind than his brother, who was fucked up most of the time
Jack barely could keep his career alive due to his several amount of problems, and thats why he didn't made sure the ranch was cared for, because he couldn't, he couldn't talk to people outside of his circle normally due to his tinnitus, he couldn't make decent decisions cause of his mental issues (caused by drugs and booze), and he left it all to Bobby, not asking about it perhaps due to laziness, but I still think Jack did feel stuff about his father and the last memory of him",9li7w0

why would cooper copy jacksons voice if he doesnt sing? jackson had the super deep almost fake sounding voice

all the articles are about bradley (jackson) specifically imitating sam elliot, coopers actors, before even hiring sam for the role. https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/05/yes-bradley-coopers-voice-star-is-born-was-physically-painful-create/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4b51687cfe05",9li7w0

e89to24,"I think the jealousy that others are influencing her artistry was less selfish than some of his other choices: he truly believed that the most important thing for an artist to do was use their platform to say *something*. His Jason Isbell song is phenomenal, btw, and a shame it was not submitted for consideration. But in many ways, others influencing Ally's career were Maine losing his control over her, something he relished from the beginning (think back to the first time he picked her up at her dad's house). 

I think what Cooper is doing as a story teller is exactly what Maine and Ally were doing as artists: they are two sides of the same entertainment industry coin. Cooper's Ally side is telling the more superficial love story between the two, the saccharine, easy, familiar story that plays well for most everyone. But I also think that Cooper's Maine side is showing a deeper, more nuanced relationship than that, and saying something more about the relationship between fame, talent, and success, and the power dynamics between the two. What I loved about this take is that Maine's jealousy wasn't tied to something inherently simple and masculine, like jealousy over a cheating guy; it's over Ally's own agency and success. Cooper could've copped out with something like that, but he didn't, and it makes the love story more pure and real.  It's clear that Maine is concerned about his own success in his conversations with his brother, but also he's concerned with Ally's success; just not enough to see that his own actions might put her in extreme danger of failure.

I do see the Messiah story, though, of Maine dying shooting Ally to the stratosphere with her going away song, and that Maine realized there was no good way for them to work out. I just see the Ally and Maine side of his character together, but I don't know if that's what was actually intended.
