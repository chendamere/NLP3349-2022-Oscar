""The Sixth Sense is one of the most incredible film experiences I've ever seen. The fact that a film can be, basically, a completely different film the second time you see it, is masterful. As awful as Shyamalan's movies have been the past decade, I will see every movie he ever makes, because I have to see if he has it in him again.""

I don't think this is NEARLY on the same level of Sixth Sense...or Signs...or Unbreakable...but just the idea that the man successfully pulled off a *secret* sequel is mind-blowing. It's like he has completely redefined what a twist ending is.

I don't think that's a fair assumption at all. The film WRAPS with the Unbreakable theme ffs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69K61Ex4TX4

This is ""Unbreakable 2"", and has clearly set up expectations for an a third movie. Shyamalan has always been vocal about his wishes to make an Unbreakable Trilogy.

It's simple as that. This was Unbreakable 2, and took the shape of a super-villain origin story.  Now it will all come together in the next.

The scene in the train station (scored to the song ""Visions"") has always been one of my favorite cinematic moments as Dunn finally accepts his gift and decides to help others....I will never forget that song.

dco7vnn,"I think it's exciting to see M. Night Shyamalan willing to make the most interesting superhero universe to date.

With *Unbreakable* and now *Split*, Shyamalan separates himself by returning to a superhero universe that feels more grounded than most films of this genre, with real consequences, traumatized protagonists, and truly interesting villains who are sympathetic, actually threatening, and absolutely deplorable.

First off, it's refreshing to see super powers that are otherworldly without being overly stylized or cartoony. In *Unbreakable* our hero's ""showdown"" doesn't require stylized action, he just chokes out a dude in a gritty, clumsy, and ultimately cathartic long take. In *Split*, minimal SFX are used to show a villain with unnerving beast-like qualities, including gruesomely feeding on his prey. It's all surprisingly dark stuff for a PG-13 film.

Then consider how both films center around personal conflicts with complete earnestness. No city or planet needs to be epically saved. Instead, we're dealing with characters shaped by dark themes of psychological trauma, physical/sexual/emotional abuse, misanthropy, etc. Key characters suffer and/or die. The approach is both darkly serious yet oddly peculiar. You don't get this stuff even in ""more mature"" super hero films like *Deadpool*, *Kick-Ass*, or *Watchmen* which are all much more over-the-top.

Instead, Shyamalan has his own unique niche within the superhero genre. It's this type of ""super-realism"" that makes these origin stories much more interesting. And though I think the film has some flaws, I can forgive them for now because **TL;DR** Shyamalan has given me a reason to be excited about the superhero genre again.",5p1gqe

It even made me wonder if they used subtle CGI on his face. He literally looked like he changed into another person. And Orwell was cool. So has the Horde totally imprisoned the group in their chairs or will the other alters whose names were seen on Kevins computer screen make an appearance in Glass? This film roped me in.

Sure, it has a bunch of issues that could’ve been done away with using tighter writing and editing, but as a whole, *Split* was next level stuff in comparison to M. Knights previous films. The cinematography just floored me with how those shots were framed and filmed in such tight spaces. And Anya Taylor-Joy becoming even more of a powerhouse actress since *The Witch* and *Barry*. And fucking James McAvoy, holy shit, was this guy something else.

As much as I loved this film, I can see people outright disliking or hating it. Especially those that have a hard time ‘buying’ into an inherently absurd premise such as dissociative identity disorder changing the way the human body works. Just remember that the film isn’t going for scientific accuracy or Le STEM. It’s telling a story about how people – mostly children – are often terribly affected by psychological trauma.

There are some genuinely crazy shit in this, like the fucking uncle scene in the woods that most filmmakers would’ve avoided given how its treading on thin ice with how it could’ve gone so wrong or been absolutely distasteful, and that masterfully directed, shot, and acted final twenty minutes or so in the climax between Casey and almost every personality inside Kevin.

dcnt0sk,"This is Shyamalan's take on Hitchcock movie tropes, the same way his 2000 film Unbreakable did with comic book superhero tropes. 

I expected the movie to be like Psycho, and it kind of was. From the Saul Bass-like opening credits to the theme of child abuse and split personality, it was very much an ode to Hitchcock's Psycho - up until the second half, where the movie becomes on its own. The second half reminded me a bit of Martyrs - yes, THAT Martyrs - when it comes to dealing with the theme of childhood trauma. In fact, this is the closest thing anyone could ask for the BETTER PG-13 rated version of Martyrs than the actual PG-13 American remake of Martyrs that Blumhouse put up with.

Speaking up which, they really pushed the PG-13 rating very hard. I didn't expect to see child abuses, pedophilia, incest (?), and sexual assaults (etc.) in this film. I mean, this is very much a R-rated material. Holy cow this is maybe the most darkest and the most bleakest movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever directed. 

And the ending with Bruce Willis actually got me. Although I played with the idea of a crossover with James McAvoy's character and Bruce Willis's character fighting together.

- It would be interesting if Mr. Glass and The Horde ended up together (maybe The Horde is captured and they end up in the same prison).

I realize this film isn't that great when displaying mental illness as a serious condition, but I can't help but feel like it's an acknowledgement by Shymalan towards how he himself has made a film where the audience is gawking at the main character for his illnesss.

Because of this, I found the ambiguity in her story's ending (does she leave the cop car?) to be off-putting. We are dealing with an incredibly sensitive topic to many and it feels slightly marginalized here.

I never thought I would ever say this as criticism but the girls were too attractive to the point where it was distracting. Anytime Marcia was on screen once Dennis had her take off her pants, I mean come on!

I'm so glad there wasn't a moment where all the personalities were quickly showcased. The story of the girl was horrible, in a disturbing way.  I wanted to puke.  The look when she just stays in the cop car, brilliant. 

Also saw on twitter people complaining and ""boycotting"" the film over its portrayal of DID. Is there anything people don't get mad about? And if you saw the film McAvoy's character is not meant to be a case study for mental illness.

I'm truly astounded by the positive reviews this is garnering. I've been excited to see this for a while, and I finally got around to it. The premise sounded really interesting to me.  

&nbsp;

I'll preface this by saying McAvoy was excellent. That I do agree with. 

I pretty much enjoyed the first 40min-1hr or so. It all got a bit tedious for me after that. The ending was absolutely atrocious. I did not expect what up to this point had been a psychological thriller to descend into some supernatural being. If I wasn't already bored, this was enough to totally turn me off from the ending. The supernatural ending dragged on way too long as well. 

&nbsp;

The psychologist chose to just completely ignore warning signs throughout the movie. I understand she genuinely cared for him(them?) and didn't want him to get lost in the system, but it got outrageous. Living in zoo? Phone the police. Suspicious enough to snoop around downstairs, go home and phone the police. Suspicious enough to leave a napkin in the door so he couldn't lock anyone in? -- fucking definitely leave and phone the police. Bolt on door -- leave and phone the fucking police. 

Three girls abducted by guy at mall with CCTV inside and out (oh and by the way, he had apparently been stalking them for days). Nah, no investigation. 

Why they didn't kick the living shit out of him when he was on his knees masquerading as a kid I will never know.  Why she hit him in the back with a chair only ONCE after knocking him to the ground, I will never know. 

And then, the creme de la creme, leaving the film off in a fully functioning zoo.....

Oh, AND THERE'S AN INEVITABLE SEQUEL TO LOOK FORWARD TO. 

&nbsp;

Maybe I went into this expecting the wrong things. I expected a realistic psychological thriller. What I got was a cheap horror film. I expected to be rating this 8/9. It ended up a 5 and that might even be slightly generous. 

PS - cheap horror film theme reinforced by the slightly creepy random undressing of the 3 girls. I'm a 22 year old guy and I'm not going to complain about it, but having the two random side characters bouncing around in their underwear just seemed unnecessary and forced for the purposes of the film. Even the lead was 'bouncing around' by the end.  

Still googled all 3 afterwards.

ddt5yqy,"**Pros:** 

* Immersing story that makes you care about what happens to multiple characters. Really enjoyed the way that background was brought in to bolster our understanding of characters. [Mainly, the lack of a ""moral"" arc for the female lead, trading off for a more primal realization (or not, we are left hanging) was great. No movie tropes.](#spoiler)

* Story is not predictable - the critics claiming that it is are full of bologna. That or they expected a horror story and the pg-13 rating limited how much this movie could shock a critic who has seen plenty of R-rated horror films.

* James McAvoy is a lot of fun to watch in this. The same can be said for the lady who played the therapist. They jointly made the split mind character work for me - just the right amount of exposition here combined with a great performance from James.

* The ending didn't lean on the typical twist. It had surprises sure, but the character arcs were well set, not jarred loose towards something unexpected at the end like some of M's movies have done (I'm looking at you, *Devil*). 

* Overall a great flick. M's best since *Unbreakable*. As crazy as this sounds, I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed Rogue One, if only because of the differences in predictability. Split is enjoyable, unpredictable, with only a tinge of ridiculousness...

**Cons:**

* M didn't handle certain side characters well. Chances to show more about the main characters were missed by literally stuffing dialogue opportunities into separate closets.

* Classic trope of a therapist realizing too late the evils done by a patient. As soon as [the doctor walks into the dungeon, we know she is going the way of the old cowboy sheriff in *Misery*.](#spoiler) Her character was great, but her role towards the final confrontation was predictable.

* Without going into spoilers, the beast fell short in presentation. You can tell they tried to mix the supernatural with something still somewhat realistic, and it came out silly onscreen. Off screen he was scary, and if they had just dimmed the lights and kept the beast in the dark... then I think the tone and scare-factor of the final confrontation would have been much better. Also, you'd leave some mystery about the villain for...

* The final scene with Kevin, and then the diner. That scene is much scarier if you still don't *really* know what the beast is. M needs a lesson in lighting. Even when he was trying to hide the beast (run from the train back home), it was too obvious that it was just a buff James McAvoy, not the double length fingered, hairy beast. Those pictures that Hedwig drew lent to the fear factor, and seeing James without a shirt on kind of toned that down unnecessarily.

The artwork he has on display is the first comic book his mother gave to him as a child. This is the cover:

http://montages.no/files/2014/06/comic-book-1.jpg

People criticizing M. Night for trying to ride the connected superhero cinematic universe need to do their research because during the original release of Unbreakable, he insisted on making this into a trilogy. I’m happy to see him one step closer to completing that initial vision. I really hope the sequel involves Dunn reaching out to Mr. Glass to try to figure out how to stop The Horde. It could be very reminiscent to Silence of the Lambs. ",5p1gqe
dcw6wz6,"So I have a few theories I wanted to toss around and see what you guys thought.

**SPOILERS**

First, when Dennis drops the flowers off in front of the train, my first thought (after the ending reveal) was of the train wreck in Unbreakable where Dunn's powers are revealed. I think that Kevin's father was killed in the same train wreck that Mr. Glass orchestrated in the first movie. If that's the case, Mr. Glass helped create both a hero and a villain, and it means he'll probably have a large part in the next film. 

Second, while this is obviously a villain origin story, it may also be Casey's hero origin as well. To elaborate, almost all super hero origin movies have a villain origin as a sub-plot. In Split, since it's a villain as the main story, the sub-plot would be the hero (Casey) and her coming into her own as a hero, which I think was displayed in her last scene when the cop asks her if she wants to go with her Uncle. Her hunting flashbacks and the last scenes show she already knows her way around a gun. I think in the next film, the beast will be killing people and causing a panic and Casey will be hunting him down vigilante style. Maybe a bit of a stretch, but it's fun to theorize. 

**edit:** Apparently during the flashback scene where she points the shotgun at her uncle her eyes turn from green to brown, maybe she has powers as well?

Third, I'm almost positive the two girls who rubbed Kevin's hands on their chests were Claire and Marcia. I feel as though out of all the 'impure' he could have picked from he picked them for a reason. ",5p1gqe

Kinda hoping to see how the sequel is going to be (if there is) but I sure hope M Night sticks to the thriller and doesn´t go to the action seeing as most definitely Mr Glass and The Beast are going to fight in some way. I personally believe there´s no more story left for Casey unless they invent some unrealistic way to tie her up with the story.

James McAvoy performance was incredible, each of the personalities was very believable.

The movie was kinda ruined for me (and probably for many other people) as the other people in the theatre would just start laughing at points which were supposed to make you feel uneasy or insecure.

He needed to feed on ""impure"" girls who were, ironically, what we would generally consider pure. He wasn't aware that Casey was, in fact, pure. He took a bite. I kinda wanted him to have some effect from having eaten part of her (leg). Like he'd weaken as he realized what he'd done, for a second and maybe she saved one last round, and using what her dad had taught her so long ago...tracking the target...killed him. Because it seems unsatisfying the way it was left. He seems to suggest that maybe she's realizing that she can also defeat the Uncle, but I almost wanted a power transference or realization from her. I realize now he can be the villain in a new movie, but I dunno, I feel like it left this one with an unclear resolution for the main character who thus far had really grown in terms of her courage, wit, and survival instincts...

Another issue I have is how the beast decides who is 'pure'. Had Casey not had those self inflicted scars on her body she would have been killed. What counts as suffering?  Whose to say the other girls haven't been through trauma. Heck if they are gonna make the beast otherworldly and climb walls they should have made him have a superpower where he can read peoples minds or past trauma.

What astonishes me is that this trait of threading together seemingly unrelated ideas in one movie, he has now extrapolated it onto a multi-movie universe. Besides Marvel and other such obvious movies, I know of no other movies performing such a connection. 

I think the whole intention of this movie was to convey two notions, that ""the broken are more evolved"" and ""our thoughts are more powerful than we know"". I am very excited to revisit Unbreakable now as I had forgotten the plot of that movie. 

Too much of American society live in states of victim consciousness. If we can begin to realize that we are the Creators of our own life then we can begin to enjoy our life and create what we really want. 

Good movies are ones where the character has growth; Casey Cooke's character did not grow. However how can we expect people to be inspired if the audience cannot identify with someone who is going through immense growth. This is a story of a girl who simply exists, no character change needed. The movie is intended to portray a sense of acceptance of where we are now, without the external push to be anywhere or anyone else. We are beautiful now, no great change is needed for us to see our beauty. Only when we embrace Self-acceptance, can any wonderful character growth begin.",5p1gqe

I believed the story was good otherwise with good acting, but I could have known everything that happens in the movie by the trailer and guessing the most predictable ending. 

I did think there was a message that was suggested by the identities' interactions with the psychiatrist. Dr. Fletcher frequently says to patients and colleagues how extraordinary people with D.I.D. are. Kevin's alters respond to the shaming they recieve due to the D.I.D. and their own ""personal"" problems (Dennis being caught  telling young women to dance naked for him) by causing the Beast to solidify from fantasy to alternate personality. They achieve a greatness through the Beast not totally dissimilar to what Dr. Fletcher thinks but differing in that this greatness by creating the Beast is no longer about survival and protecting Kevin, but for the glory and power of the personalities collective, or at least the horde collective. And in doing so they (and partially Dr. Fletcher) create a monster. 
The horde believes that it, or they, are greater because they are ""scarred"". As if to rebound from being told they have less value/dignity as people because of what has happened to them and what they have done to say that they are not only not less, but in fact greater than those with no scars, who are inferior and chosen to be fed to the beast.",5p1gqe

1. Kevin/ The Horde leaves flowers next to the train. Dunn was he only survivor of that train possibly indicating that Kevin's father was on that train and died. This could have begun the abuse Kevin endured as a child, meaning that his mom coped in abusive ways.

2. In the stadium one of the first people it shows David Dunn run into was a mom and child. When he makes that initial connection he hears the child screaming as the mom is yelling. Since it was indicated that M Night Shyamalan initially wanted the character in Unbreakable, it could be seen as a foreshadow.

I thought James McAvoy carried a good bit off the film which is a testament to his performance but the main actress Anya Taylor-Joy also gave a pretty solid performance. Some of the side characters where a little hit and miss and some of the decisions they made where laughable (good old horror tropes and that).

I don't get creeped out much by horror but this movie definitely had me a little creeped. More so the peverse parts of the film giving me flashbacks to the same vibes true detective and gone baby gone provoked. The woods scene was creepy as fuck and I'd like it cleansed from my memory.

dd0f6r0,"Just finished watching this: 

1. The only disappointing moment was when Bruce Willis was revealed and I was the only one in the theater shocked, but that's to expected. Unbreakable is 16 years old and not as well known as The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable and The 6th Sense is like Carlito's Way and Scarface or Choke and Fight Club. 

2. That tie in was so fitting. In the beginning, we were dealing with multiple personalities, but McAvoy was still human. But once the beast emerged, we were dealing with something else. The possibility was introduced throughout the movie, wit was still a bit wild to go from regular person with a mental illness to superhuman who can snap people in half and is impervious to Knives and point blank shotgun blasts. But once Willis appears, we knew what universe we were in and the existence of the beast seemed more natural. 

3. After fawning over the ending, it's worth noting that even without it, we still have a solid movie here. The movie built tension perfectly and McAvoy killed it. My only gripe is I wish they built the characters of the other two girls more. I didn't really care when they died. I can understand not wanting to focus on them too much, but a couple scenes so the girls could bond would have made me feel for them more, even if it was just because their relationship to Casey.

Hedwig is a 9 year old boy and doesn't have the strength to push the door open against two teenage girls, however as soon as Dennis takes over the host he is able to open the door with ease.

dcsot3z,"I thought it was a good movie, probably his best since Signs ( I also enjoyed The Visit). James McAvoy turned in a very strong performance as The Horde and Anya Taylor-Joy did a good job at making Casey an empathetic character and I felt that Shyamalan constructed a backstory for her that made her struggles with her situation all the more dire. The sense of regret within Casey for not acting against her Uncle for what he did really resonated throughout the film and I really wanted to see her have the strength to survive. 

There were some things I found a little flimsy, like at the end when the news reporter says something along the lines of ""he based his identities loosely off the animals he worked with at the Zoo"". I get the correlation between Miss Patricia to Lions and Hedwig to an Owl, but I didn't really see the overall relevance of this point. I also was kind of let down by the plot overall, as I was anticipating the super-hyped twist to pertain to what was going on with Kevin (though the tie-in with Unbreakable was cool nonetheless) but the story kind of unfolded much like you'd imagine it would based on the trailers.",5p1gqe
dcvpcaa,I don't get the hate for the ending or how it's become a superhero movie.. much of everything mcavoy's character does has some scientific basis. There're actually cases of people lifting things many times their weight during adrenaline rushes and the whole muscle is stimulated by thought thing. They even threw hints throughout the story like the woman who regained her eyesight or even how one of the personalities requires insulin for diabetes. It's a subtle indication how strong his mind can alter his body. It's not a superhero thing. It's very plausible. It's a really good movie and M Night just went meta with his own twists. ,5p1gqe

Actually what caught my attention was when the Unbreakable theme started to chime in over the Horde. It's a very recognizable theme to me and I've listened to the soundtrack many times, one of my favorites.  Didn't occur to me at first why he was recycling that music, but I'm glad this movie was made and more of it is being done.

So I do like this movie, it's very much in his style on many levels and it's very well done and interesting.  There were a few problems with it, nothing too major though.  Although the Visit had its moments and did some fun things surprisingly well, this is the first movie he's made that really works and makes a great contribution to cinema since Signs.

I feel like they'll meet up in the third movie (if one is to be made) and she will explain to him how she is not vulnerable to him and that'll help defeat The Beast.

Even after I left the theater, I was left questioning who Mr. Glass was and why that was thrown in to the movie. But, thanks to you guys, I was able to understand it a lot better and that helped put the movie in a new perspective for me. 

After sitting here and thinking about the movie after I had watched it, I actually enjoyed it. James McAvoy killed it again and I love the diversity in his roles, such as Charles Xavier in the X-Men series and Bruce Robertson in Filth, just for a couple of examples. It was a very nice psychological thriller that left me guessing until the end. Who was the Beast? How far will Kevin go? Will everyone survive in the end?

de3vydl,"I can't wait for ""U3."" I find it fascinating between the opposing elements between the first two movies. One villain is incredibly intelligent and physically weak, the other is incredibly strong but mentally ""weak."" They will challenge Dunn in completely different ways if they both appear in 3rd film (which I bet they will). Like Joker or Riddler vs Kroc/Bane in the Batman world (although Bane is quite cerebral as well). Also the balance of Casey physically losing her father in Split, and Joseph struggling with the potential emotional loss of his father in Unbreakable. ",5p1gqe
dejo384,"Don't forget the research. Kevin was the ""man"" he was limited based on past beliefs (he was never awake), empowered through multiple personalities that had so many different interests and thoughts, he was protected by Barry (who remembered all the abuse - triggered by work attack) and Hedwig had the child like wander and ability to move in and out of the light (speaks to his imagination - think about his window drawings) and Patricia was his inner femininity (which human males do actually have female genetic codes; same with females).  

The physical representation of the Beast in Kevin's mind; resulted in a mentally and  physically stronger Kevin. I feel this movie shows the truth potential in the capabilities of the human brain. That if you believe enough you will ultimately influence and shape your reality with your thoughts. 

Only those strong enough to do that truly understood and experienced pain and suffering. Because evolution is triggered by the need to survive - unleashing your inner animal instinct. Which is now controlled by Barry ""the protector"" and Hedwig the child who has unlimited imagination and believes anything is possible. 

The ending to me reflects the excitement of them letting the Beast out with no limitations and learning about a whole new group of personalities. That by the way we have no idea what those personalities may be.

During M. Night's cameo, Dr. Fletcher tells him that ""*you're getting soft around the middle*"" and that he's ""*not meticulous enough.*"" Basically, I think that's a reference to the arc of his career, where he started so strongly, made weak movies in the middle, and is now returning to form.

Also, besides the references to **Unbreakable**, I feel there are other referencess to his filmography throughout:

* The way The Beast quickly walks to the side in the dark hallway at the end reminds me of the movement of [the alien at the birthday party](https://youtu.be/aIhnqkXWSR8?t=51s) in **Signs**

* When Hedwig says ""I just ate a hot dog,"" it seems random but I'm pretty sure it's a sly wink to this [hilariously infamous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Iz4D9kBIas) in **The Happening**

* Also may be a stretch, but when Patricia puts flowers in the girls' hair, it could be a nod to [this look](http://www.hotflick.net/flicks/2004_The_Village/004TVL_Bryce_Dallas_Howard_014.jpg) in **The Village**.

denjt9h,"I adore UNBREAKABLE... And I think everything about it works. But an audience members reaction to SPLIT will go one of three ways: (1) giddy excitement, (2) utter disappointment or (3) total confusion. I fell into the second category. 

I've heard a great deal of praise for the film and I can see where SPLIT works for people... Especially for film-goers accustomed to their connecting Marvel movies... However, when I personally heard the UNBREAKABLE score start to play during McAvoy's mirror scene... I felt all the tension the film had built crumble. 

This film's ending, IMO, was a cheat. The ending feels like a fail-safe. Before I dive into what didn't work, I want to be clear: I was enjoying myself during SPLIT more than I have in any Shyamalan film since SIGNS. Maybe not every scene worked (particularly M. Night's cameo scene) but godDAMN does McAvoy deliver one hell of a performance. His performance is the reason this film captures you. Same for Anya Taylor-Joy's performance, who plays Casey Cooke; She genuinely holds her own with McAvoy... 

My primary issue with the film concerns Anya's character and her arc. M. Night sets up Casey's arc throughout these flashbacks with her father and uncle in the woods hunting and when McAvoy finally becomes the original personality, Kevin, he tells her where the shotgun is stored; This made me hope things would boil down to Anya having that choice again, having the shotgun in her hands and having a hard time killing Kevin in a more quiet, emotional scene. For Anya's arc to fully pay off, she needed to kill James McAvoy's character... There needed to be more there but M. Night seemed more preoccupied with setting up his own Marvel cinematic universe. 

Just bear with me: what if Anya and Kevin had one last intimate, quiet scene where Anya ultimately pulls the trigger when the personalities begin building back up to the Beast... She walks away, thinking he's dead and it's all over... She did what she should have back in those woods... But what if McAvoy became the Beast before the wound could fully kill McAvoy and he heals, and THEN goes after Anya... Maybe that would've made more sense for her arc...

I understand that ultimately it was her abuse from her uncle that saved her from being eaten by the Beast... But what kinda message and arc is that for her if she never really FACES that traumatic event? You know, she needed to finally be given a CHOICE again and time to contemplate that choice... She never gets to have that moment, IMO. The film's final moments don't give the weight that Casey's final scene should have had. There's simply no weight to Casey Cooke's final look at the police officer when she informs her that her uncle is there to pick her up... Not that I didn't enjoy the film while I was watching it but the ending disappointed me. Felt cheap and lazy.",5p1gqe
dfa1ffp,"Good first act, the tension building up in the 2nd act was phenomenal but, the 3rd act really started to drag for me.

I feel that the rest of the movie stands on it's own, separate self even if his intention all along was to make this an origin story for Unbreakable. I mean people that have not seen UB won't get the ending and some that have won't remember who Glass was. Still giving it a 7 but just wish the 3rd act lived up to the rest of the movie.",5p1gqe

It did something no other film has done. M. Night Shamalan made a sequel to movie 17 years later, but it's still a well made and contained film. He did it at a time that made sense, superhero movies are over saturated and boring. I typically go see these movies with my friends, and don't really enjoy superhero films. I love this movie. I hope another one releases. I like the realism of this universe. It gives me a Watchmen feel. The performances were fantastic. I now have a crush on that really cute blonde girl that was sort of a dumb bitch at first but she grew on me and I really liked her. James McAvoy was fantastic. This is my favorite performance of a villain and is my favorite origin story. Everything from the credits, the cinematography, the pacing, the acting, the story structure, it was all perfect. It kept the story very simple, but did really cool little things like the door scene, the part with Hedwig walking, the conversation with the psychiatrist. As someone who is majoring in psych, I fucking love this movie. New favorite.

",5p1gqe
dfgkm2r,"So, I have a theory about the movie. Help me see if I'm a little bit right over here

Casey is one of Kevin's personalities.

So, by the beginning of the movie I've had this weird feeling about how Casey behaves and how her placement in the scenes are somewhat paradoxals. She is portrayed as a really introspective girl who prefers being by herself and somehow ends up in other girl's company at the beginning, although she could've just denied going there. And later her ""friend"" (who seemingly didn't like her) makes such effort for Casey to come along with her, her friend and her father that it looked really odd.

The next sequel looked pretty odd too, because of a little detail: She as getting a ride home and sits in the front seat, I mean, who does that?! It may look like a decision for the director to make the scene more suitable for tension, but M. Night made the sixth sense 18 years ago, so he knows how to make things seem dubious all the time.

Another fact to look up here is the scene where Casey first talks to Hedwig and deals with him with a lot of calm, like she knew how to deal with him.

But these were just oddities, what made me realize that she is a Kevin's personalities were:

1. Dr. Karen Fletcher stating that two personalities can come to ""light"" at the same time

2. Casey scene where she was apparently abbused by her uncle

3. Denis taking the ""light"" when Kevin was abused

Conecting these I've come to the conclusion that Casey was with the light all along with some other personality, except when Kevin was abused, because she also blackened out in the abuse scene. 

Maybe all of this explains why the beast didn't attack her at the end of the movie after all.

dcpk24d,"In retrospect, I should've seen the twist/Easter Egg coming. I was kind of wondering why the film was veering in the direction of soft fantasy after being played relatively straight the entire time. I thought that opening panning shot of Casey in the car looked exactly like the panning shot with David on the train. Also, the Horde converses in front of a series of mirrors as James Newton Howard's Unbreakable score plays shortly before the end scene. At times, the cinematography seems to reuse or intentionally use similar shots to Unbreakable (obviously to great effect. This is probably one of Shyamalan's best looking films). Looks like I'll just have to watch it again to see how the color scheme, shot composition, use of framing, etc. match up to Unbreakable.

Needless to say, I liked this film a lot. Apart from James McAvoy putting on possibly the performance of a career, Anya-Taylor Joy and Betty Buckley were standouts in my opinion. There were also a lot of little things that I enjoyed that helped to reinforce the feeling of creepiness, such as the girls slowly getting their clothes taken away from them. It kind of foreshadows (flashbackshadows?) the type of abuse Casey went through as a youth before you put it together. Even as a film in its own right, it's a pretty effective film about mental illness, rising above abuse to make yourself stronger (and possibly a veiny cannibal monster), and conquering past demons. I also thought it was pretty clever to have Casey confess the fact that she goes to detention on purpose and spends the climax in a cell. There's actually quite a bit of foreshadowing now that I think about it.

For instance - we see that Kevin has no scars. So he was probably never really injured. Perhaps all of his personalities are just as strong - but don't know it. If his power is being able to think a change in himself into existence, too - that could explain it. A scared little boy imagines a 9 year old friend - BOOM Hedwig. He dreams up a better mother?

I liked Split a lot, but it is one of those movies that is so good it makes you mad it's not great. I think it's actually a better movie if you see it a second time because you have a better understanding of what it is. Even still there are too many things set up with no pay off. Here are my complaints:

#SPOILER

The fact that you're waiting for the beast and there are these three girls leads you to believe that you're actually waiting for something to happen to trigger the beast, but that's not what happens. He just turns into the beast for no reason (I guess because the movie's almost over?). That was a total fuckin' bummer. Why set everything up so intricately and not deliever on any of it? Honestly, it felt like half a movie; the real story of Billy Milligan should have been borrowed much more than it was. It would have been infinitley better if they borrowed more from what the story was based on (the life of Billy Milligan, which is endlessly fascinating) and made everything more believable in a grounded real world basis like the way Unbreakable was. Too many scenes brought me out of the reality of the picture. It felt like there were two writers; the brilliant and creative M. Night Shyamalan from the very late 90's and very early 2000's and the suck ass M. Night Shyamalan post The Village. Which makes sense considering he pulled scenes word for word from the original script to Unbreakable. Also the way they connected the two movies was so fucking poorly written. ""Hey The Horde, that's like that other guy they talked about"" NO IT'S FUCKING NOT! That was fucking mental. They couldn't come up with anything better than that? Just have Bruce Willis as David Dunn come in and look at the news as he changes into the green rain pancho. That's all they fucking needed. It would have fit beautifully, but no M. Night needed some clunky dopey dialogue to fuck up a perfectly suitable ending.",5p1gqe

Split is not a continuation of Unbreakable, as it has it's own completely different story and characters.

I need to watch the movie again because I think he kept Kevin right handed with the way he had the blanket draped around himself while Dennis left handed.

Those were my thoughts for someone who has never seen unbreakable!

Now after reading up some spoiler reviews about its link to the Unbreakable universe, my perspective is starting to change quite abit. Don't get me wrong, the thought of Kevin as a supervillian would pretty cool if it eventually linked to the universe, but the thought of Kevin vs Bruce Willis in a sequel would take away the supernatural horror element I liked about SPLIT. 

So my question now is: does Kevin get his powers only in his 'Beast' form? Or is he already a superhuman regardless of which persona he is playing. In other words, he has a passive ability that is already there, but he chooses to recognise it only in his 'Beast' form because of his DPD.

It's true that she was holding still and wasn't being a threat but it would seem uncharacteristic of what we know of Dennis for him to just let her sit in the car regardless of how cooperatve she was. So what if she has a power too? So far all the hero's and villains have been people who have experienced some kind of trauma in their lives, and Casey certainly fits the bill of this. The doctor posits that maybe these people who are broken by past trauma are actually more than we are, or have some kind of power. What if Casey's power is the ability to go unnoticed? It would fit with her background of not wanting to be seen and just wanting to be left alone.

[In the beginning car scene the didnt knock her out at first...was going to let her stick around. But realized she was having thoughts of messing it up so he took away ""her light""](#spoiler)

[The doctor said he could manifest two personalities at once, but he never really did this in the movie. The closest thing was when dennis was pretending to be Barry. This makes me think him and the girl are almost always out. ] (#spoiler)

[when he separated the girls into separate rooms, he said something like ""we cant have them together in the same room"" basically excluding Casey from that statement...] (#spoiler)

dct4j2a,"I really love the way it all kind of works back into that whole, ""your mind makes it real"" motif. In Unbreakable, Mr. Glass believed so wholly that for him to be the way he is, there must have been someone the exact opposite as this person gave him purpoe. So after a few terrorist attacks, he finally finds Mr. Right, or David. Not saying that David was made because of Mr.Glass, rather, those two had always existed, but Glass drew him out creating David's persona of the Unbreakable superhero.
In this movie, it's sorta like that, in it that Dennis, Patricia, and Hedwig believe in The Beast and it really is a thing, not how Dr. Fletcher was trying to rationalize it. The belief in The Beast eventually manifests and then he takes on these attributes that the other three said he had (wall climbing, super stength, etc.) But it raises the question of has it always been inside Kevin or is itself a split personality of a split personality?  The other alters, from what they've told Fletcher, sound like they don't believe it, or that they know Patrica or Dennis are making it up.
It actually drew on Primal Fear a little for me in that respect of, was there ever X personality to begin with? Also taking a little from The Minds of Billy Milligan, in the whole an alter plots a crime the others don't know about.
Anya Taylor-Joy was also chilling to see especially during the scenes with Hedwig. Like he's got this juvenile crush on her and acts out these feelings in an innocent way, but he's also a grown man. And Casey's resolve is almost like little parts of her shut down to kind of block out that trauma. I guess as another parallel to Unbreakable; if Glass was the anti-thesis for David Dunn, Casey is the same for Kevin Crumb. Where Kevin's psyche split to protect him from the abuse, Casey just shut herself away. 
Better movie than what Shyamalan's come out with in a while. I'm glad I saw it. I'm wondering if he's doing a cinematic universe as well.

But in the end it's just okay. 

And mostly that's due to M. Night's writing. Half the scenes are just overly convoluted to the point they lack congruency. For instance, when any of the characters are in the room (including Hedwig), the girls are complete freaking morons, but the moment he's out of the room they turn into little geniuses. 

M. Night creates these amazing worlds, but even he can't stay focused long enough to truly live by that world's rules and it waters everything down.

I found it really slow, for one, and the exposition that comes out of Dr. Fletcher's mouth is ridiculously written, especially when she's explaining the beast. Casey is frustratingly incompetent, she literally waits for him to put on his mask and spray her with the knockout gas while the door to the car is open. Two of the three girls have zero agency or characterization, and the movie is weirdly obsessed with getting them to strip down to their underwear (yet somehow he never sees Casey's scars until the last scene, despite the fact that he keeps taking her clothes off). 

The movie felt like it was trying to make some lofty point about becoming stronger despite trauma and turning your demons into the better angels of your nature, trying to play Casey and Kevin off each other as two answers to childhood abuse, and this especially comes through in the scene where she walks through the zoo, but I had no idea what the movie was actually saying.

There were also pillow cases on the bed, they could have put their heels and shoes in them and hit him with that. Last but not least, there was a glass mirror in the bathroom. So if all three attacked at the same time with the mirror, pillowcase and kick they could have ended Kevin.

That said, James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy where both really, really good. 

And the cinematography was really solid. As well as the music. But I think there was a lot of missed opportunity especially with the main girl's backstory. And I really didn't feel very satisfied with the way they wrapped up her story. 

I haven't seen Unbreakable so unfortunately I can't comment on that twist other than that it felt a bit unnecessary. From the outsider perspective, I kinda wish it was it's own stand alone movie. But maybe when I eventually get around to Unbreakable it will make more sense.

dd5uct9,"Just got back from seeing this with my girlfriend.  Wow! What a heavy movie.  Really enjoyed it, it was engulfing and had me holding my breath for long periods.  The theater we saw it in (Loews Boston Common) isn't the best atmosphere traditionally (lots of urban youth) but the crowd was silent.  Not too jump-scary, great suspense building.  And that acting...

I really think James McAvoy deserves a nom for this (they don't let me vote, so what does that matter).  At one point he's playing Dennis playing Barry.  I just thought that was so good (the nod with M. Night Shyamalan ""it's an act"" was cute).  Anya Taylor-Joy is rapidly becoming one of my favorites as well, she's so striking.  Between this and The VVitch, she's my new favorite ""atmospheric-horror queen"" (a position previously unheld).  Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula round out the fun acting of teenage girls who aren't complete fucking idiots.  

As for the all-important ""cast spoiler"" I have never seen Unbreakable.  I want to, I've heard it's great, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  Obviously, I appreciate that it is cool that this takes place in a universe where we already know that superheroes and supervillains are real, but the total time on screen of any of that is minimal.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the two other girls that were held captive; I think M. Night could've directed them a little bit better, and I was kind of disappointed that some scenes were forced into the film to basically be 'data dumps', for example-the therapist telling that college class about personality disorders.

dcqshby,"So a couple questions. 

Why do you think Patricia flipped out when she cut the sandwich crooked? Dennis is the OCD one, it seemed weird. Or am I looking too much into that?

Am I understanding correctly that we actually didn't see Barry except for a brief moment at the end? Barry would email the doctor but when Keven arrived, it was always Dennis pretending to be Barry? Until the doctor figured it out. 

That's insane though, one personality pretending to be another just to hide the fact that Hedwig had Barry trapped in his chair. And in my opinion Hedwig is the most powerful personality... doesn't he say he has the power to put whoever he wants in the light and Barry has to stay in his chair and watch? But as a child he is manipulated by Dennis and Patricia. 

Is there any significance to the flowers? There was a flower in the girls bathroom, one scene where the main chick woke up with a flower next to her, and Patricia putting flowers in the girls hair. The flowers at the train station can be explained if you think they are in memory of Kevin's dad who we all think died in the sun readable train crash.

The whole movie though I kept trying to find how it'd connect.  First with the psychologist, I figured she'd mention her ""other patient, Elijah Price"".  Then they mentioned Kevin last seeing his dad getting on a train and started trying to do mental math on that one.  Next I wondered if Mr. Glass was who Kevin was really referring to whenever he talked about proving what ""he"" says is true about them being more powerful than people realize.

dcyczpg,"Just came back and was disappointed for a few reasons. Wanna jot down my thoughts, but I was probably a bit overhyped considering I'm a huge McAvoy fan and psychological thriller fan.

- I went to an 11:30am showing and apparently they don't show trailers that early at AMC so I missed the opening. When I sat down the girls were already kidnapped and Dennis was sitting down and then took out the one girl to either rape her or make her dance or whatever

- I usually don't like watching movie or TV trailers too much but the Split trailers definitely showed too much. A lot of the tension was removed from some scenes and I think part of that was because of the trailers while part of that was just average film-making. I just watched Prisoners about a month ago and the difference in tension and urgency was staggering between the two.

- People kept telling me there was a great twist that I'd never guess. 1) I've never seen Unbreakable so Bruce Willis showing up at the end did nothing for me. 2) I kept thinking there was some twist during the movie so I was overanalyzing things expecting a typical M. Night twist but nothing would have really made sense. 3) Even after googling, the ""twist"" isn't even really a twist as it doesn't change much, then again I haven't seen Unbreakable like I said so maybe there's more I'm missing.

- The flashbacks were way too heavy foreshadowing, by about the 2nd one you could easily predict where they were going. Should have either been all at once near the end of the movie or spread out better.

- I find it a tiny bit unrealistic that nobody else picked up what Kevin was doing considering he was right under the zoo the entire time. No other maintenance guys? Nobody questioned where he slept? He managed to drag 3 girls in there without security picking it up? Maybe some of this was better explained in the start of the movie that I missed.

- So the Beast targets people who haven't experienced suffering and eats them to gain power or something? How could he tell that the two other girls didn't have any trauma or abuse of their own, a bit too convenient that Casey had visible scars. Additionally wouldn't the Beast's intimidation give the other two girls enough trauma that they'd be strong enough and he shouldn't eat them?

- Maybe other people think differently but the Beast being a real thing was kind of a let down to me, I can suspend my belief about the 23 different personalities but being able to eat shotgun bullets just by believing was crossing the line slightly. Additionally, what was up with buying flowers and stuff?


Overall it was enjoyable but I was definitely let down and had some nagging gripes.

It was revealed that the two most troubled personas would take over in times of great distress, with a third one who could appear at will. Their mission was to protect everyone, with the leading one having OCD so as to keep everything spotless and not catch the attention of their abusive mother. Through pain, it was explained, people could develop these multiple personalities, and change their bodies in ways that was not thought possible, simply through the power of will.

This is when the film stopped being interesting. The villain revealed that he had a new personality, a powerful beast that sought to eat the ""impure"", that is, people who had never suffered and would thus not reach their potential. What followed was a lame scene where the monster chased the protagonist around, left her alone upon realizing that she had been abused, and was thus ""pure"", and then disappeared. The film ended with the villain giving a supervillain-type speech about how he would show the world that he is powerful. He was then given a supervillain nickname. I went home, opened the discussion thread on Reddit, and found out that this was indeed the sequel of a superhero movie. Basically, what started as an interesting tale of a tortured individual who developed a severe mental illness as a result of trauma turned into the origin story of a vain supervillain who will show you all how powerful he is in Split 2.

It goes from what seems like a realish scenario to something about heroes and villains? I know it confused my mom and little brother who thought the plot was getting ""silly"" at the end there and I had to explain what unbreakable was and how it connects to this movie and even then they thought the final 15 minutes was stupid. Its weird because half the audience cheered at the end and the other half thought it was really stupid (mainly the younger part of the audience who definitely have never seen unbreakable) so only people who know MNS work and like it should watch this film. 

For the film itself I thought McAvoy and the main girl did very well and thought everyone else delivered their lines pretty badly. And there are some common MNS scenes like when the cop says ""its just an animal the dog is barking at"" get it? because he's ""the beast"". Stuff like that is pretty bad but overall if all you're looking for an ok thriller and have seen unbreakable then you should go out to see this movie if you thought it looked interesting.   ",5p1gqe

I've already made a post about how I think the movie is brilliant. I love McAvoy's performance. I'm so glad to see Shyamalan back, but I have one critique to make:

I feel like for the 9 year old boy personality, his voice sounds more ""mentally challenged"" than ""little boy"", and in my theater, I don't know about anyone else's, most of the audience was laughing somewhat unintentionally just by the tone of his voice.

I loved M. Night's first four movies, so much heart. I felt like the Unbreakable nod at the end of Split was just forced attempt at trying a twist. If this is a return to form for M.

It has no subtlety or nuance and makes countless amateur filmmaking mistakes, and is full of cliches.

dcnuweo,"This is a really interesting movie to discuss.  On a technical level, its fantastic, the cinematography perfectly fit the claustrophobic themes of the movie.  Even when we were outside and out of ""the Horde's"" house, several of the shots were up close and filmed at intense angles.  Only when our characters are free (at the beginning and end) do we get to see wind angles of the world around them.  The music works perfectly with the movie, although I'll probably never listen to it in my free time, I can say at the very least it aided the film.

As for the performances, they were all good for the most part.  Obviously McAvoy is the star of the show, but I was also equally invested in Buckley's character as well.  The best part of the movie was slowly building my understanding of what exactly the Horde was.

I'd also like to take a moment to point out how violent this was for a PG-13 movie.  I'm stunned by the amount of gore/violence that was allowed into its rating.

The weakest aspects are easily the two other girls and Casey's flashbacks.  The two other leads played a large role in the first act, but as the film went on, their relevance to the overall story became less focused.  As for the flashback scenes, while done well, their seemingly random placement throughout the run time took me out of the movie and left me asking what triggered them.

As for the connection to Unbreakable and a hint at a larger universe, I personally am not a fan of the idea, but at this point it's too early to tell.  I feel his best films have worked best in their own little worlds.  However, I'd be pleased if he could prove me wrong.

dcpeify,"I wasn't a huge fan of Unbreakable, so to me, the ending wasn't really a twist. That and I had read on Wikipedia that this was supposed to be a theoretical sequel to Unbreakable, so I guess I was expecting something a little more vague than Willis showing up at the end and directly referring to the other film.

HOWEVER. I do have one theory. It's probably a bit more out there, but this is going to be my TWEEST. Some of this is based on not-so-great child acting and also connecting some far-apart lines.

Follow me here. I'll give you the twist first.

Casey (??) has multiple personalities as well. At least 2 in her noggin.

Supporting ideas:
1) Dennis came out when Kevin was very young, due to his mother abusing him. He was OCD and kept things clean because it was how he kept Kevin under the radar. You can see that Casey seems more vibrant when she's talking with her dad. After her uncle starts doing stuff, she seems like a different person. Yes, I know that that could be because of the abuse, but I think that that was when her personality came out.

Whatever her other personality was was the person who came in during those abusive encounters to mentally block Casey from the trauma. That other personality is also the one that was going to shoot the uncle. 

Of course, a lot of this could just be (and probably is) me over-interpreting a child actress having a dead look on her face.

2) When the police officer tells Casey that her uncle is there to pick her up, her face goes ""dead-eyed"" again and the officer takes a small step back like ""WTF man."" This could mean that Casey is resolved not to put up with her uncle's shit anymore, that she's going to tell the officer what's going on, OR... that that other personality is checking back in again.

3) When Casey is by herself in the ""bedroom"" near the end of the movie, she's wailing and crying REALLY hard, which is completely different than how she was behaving before, even when she was alone. Why did she suddenly get that way? I think that that was her original, damaged personality coming out for a bit, remembering shit, and getting upset.

So theory: Casey has at least one other personality. Maybe she'll start splitting off as well, but the Beast at the end, when he looked at her and said to rejoice because she was pure, meant perhaps that yes, she had all the scars and had suffered, but also maybe that she was like him in that she was ""split.""

That's my twist. Rip it apart if you'd like. :)",5p1gqe
dcsnafk,I liked it up until he started climbing on the walls.,5p1gqe
dctui3r,"Typically a lurker on here, but I'd figure I'd finally break that streak and actually say something. 

If/When they make a 3rd movie in the Unbreakable universe, I thought of something interesting that could happen to Casey (assuming, of course, she's in the next film). 

Her and Kevin are connected through their stories of abuse, and he spares her at the end because he realizes that she too has suffered greatly, just like him. Since Kevin/Dennis/Patricia seem to believe that the Beast is a ""higher form"" of human evolution which can only be reached by suffering great trauma, what if the reason he spared Casey's life was because not only do they share dark pasts, but because he believed she could one day be like him? And when I say be like him, I mean develop DID to the point where it is uncontrollable. 

I'm not sure that's possible however, since I don't know if DID only forms in children or it can occur at any age. 

That being said though, what if, instead of helping Kevin defeat the Horde in the 3rd film, Casey slowly becomes like Kevin, eventually unlocking a Beast of her own inside of her? 

That would certainly make for a great M. Night twist. No one would see it coming. Thoughts?",5p1gqe

She said that she didn't understand why she was the only one that had to take them... that doesn't make sense. I know different personas can have different diseases but a disease like diabetes can't just pause with the brain. 
My theory is the fact that he worked at a zoo, maybe they weren't actually insulin shots... but something that was meant for the animals. Like animal hormones/bear tranquilizers haha! 
Seems kind of silly but it helps make sense of the superhuman strength a little. ",5p1gqe
dcpaa5k,"It's a pretty good flick, even if it never fully elevates itself above the schlocky premise. Shamalan pulls off some really creative shots, and seems to know that the audience is always trying to look for the twist. Certain information always seems to be left up to speculation, keeping the viewer guessing about how they'll be shook. (For example, it seemed very deliberate that it is never reveled what's in the sandwhiches served to the girls. Combined with the uncurrent of them being 'sacred food', it naturally leads to speculation)

As for the actual twist(s), they're hit-and-miss. Casey having such an overwhelmingly tragic backstory felt a bit exploitive, and I felt like it would've been more compelling had her younger self actually killed her uncle. Instead, the last confrontation with the Beast seems to credit the lifetime of abuse with her 'purity'.

McAvoy is clearly having the time of his life in this role, and it's the main reason to see the film. Even if we only get a deep dive on a few of the personalities, he makes each one very distinct. It's a very hammy, over-the-top performance, and just a lot of fun. Gotta love it. Connecting his mental disorder with 'superhuman' abilities was fun, though thoroughly over explained through the psychiatrist character. Combined with the trailer, which shows his 'transformation' - it made it very easy to piece together.

Then there's the last scene. It's almost an injustice to call it a twist, as instead it seems like a Marvel-esque franchise tease. This better lead to an honest-to-god Unbreakable sequel being put into action, or the whole thing is just a hollow cameo.

But I do love that Shyamalan pulled it off. Halfway through the film, I had myself thinking ""Man, it'd be crazy if this was somehow a backdoor X-Men movie or something"", but wrote it off because of the obvious limitations of franchising. Why would you not advertise the connection between two films, when original works are at such a disadvantage in Hollywood? But when that connection is to a film like Unbreakable, it makes perfect sense. A new original Shyamalan picture is a more valuable pitch than a sequel to a Bruce Willis film most people have forgotten about.

Overall, it's worth a watch. In theaters, if only to preserve the twist.",5p1gqe

Aside from the normal thriller type scenes (trying to get away before the bad guy gets in or notices) there wasn't a whole lot of tension. Which is odd to me because if nothing else M Night was always really good at building tension in scenes. It also just didn't have many characteristics of an M. Night movie. Usually the dialogue is very soft spoken with a lot of blank stare moments then the occasional super dry humor.

I also am not a fan of the Unbreakable tie in if the goal is to make another movie for that. ",5p1gqe
dcpeuyv,"It's definitely better than anything else M. Night has done in a while, but that doesn't mean it's good. There were pacing issues, and several of the actors were so bad that they took me out of the film, mainly the two side chicks and expositional therapist. Additionally, I'm not sure M. Night Shyamalan has ever listened to real people talk because some of the dialogue was incredibly unnatural and felt straight out of The Happening.

On the positive side, James McAvoy was very, very, very good. It felt like the idea of the film and his performance were wasted by poor execution from Shyamalan. Anya Taylor-Joy was also good. The cinematography and shot composition were great. The music was solid.

Addressing the twist/easter egg/sequel set-up, I thought it was laughably bad. It felt like a spoof from a late night or awards show. I honestly couldn't believe Shyamalan tried to tie this into Unbreakable, not just because of the disparity in quality, but also the tonal difference between the films. While the films share a similar idea of a ""grounded"" superhero and supervillain, Unbreakable took its subject matter far more seriously. This isn't a perfect comparison, but dropping Bruce Willis's David Dunn in Split would be like throwing Christopher Nolan's Batman in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

dcpgcs6,"Something about the movie I wonder if intentional occurred to me. It involves the relationship with the therapist. Was she accidentally empowering him? 

One of, if not the most common causes reported is childhood trauma. However more interesting to me is that there is some controversy that cases of DID can be caused by therapist endorsing ideas to their patients that may be make them behave how they think someone with the disorder would. I won't go into great detail about it but the Wikipedia page has a decent section under the controversy section on the DID page. 

So was her therapy part of the reason he was able to obtain power? Due to her reinforcement of them being special and unlocking potentials of the brain? 

This mirrors to me some of the ideas of people who say that therapist cause DID. I wonder if this was intentional if the writers knew about this therapist caused controversy. Not that she created his disorder but that she helped him ascend due to her reinforcement like therapist could cause personalities to develop through treatment. 


I'm sure most people know that Dissociative identity disorder(formerly called Split Personality Disorder). Is controversial. I had a professor who brought in a fellow colleague who suffered from DID. It was pretty convincing to watch, as he brought her in over the course of a weeks to see changes. She was a female to a male,  and definitely had personality changes. 

So this movie obviously wasn't trying to be representive of real life state of DID in the field . But I did find some interesting parallels with the therapist relationship, whether intentional or not. I wish that people ""protesting"" the film would be able to understand that the film just uses it as a tool, like movies do with many real life things they Alter a bit. 


As for the movie 9 out of 10. Great acting by McAvoy. Think that seeing unbreakable first made it so high for me. A lot of praise has been said here thay I agree with so no need for me see. 

Sadly I had a bad theater experience. I brought my 6 year old brother and he was quieter than the adults who yelled out constantly. One tapped their foot the whole time and argued with her boyfriend over getting more popcorn while the lead girl was in the hallway getting chased.

dcpik4s,"I enjoyed the movie, from the writing to the fantastic performance by James McAvoy. However, as someone who's never seen Unbreakable, the twist ending really detracted itself for me as a good stand alone film. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed twists like Sixth Sense, which made all the plot points up until then make sense. All Split's twist does is connect it to one of Shyamalan previous films, which I feel fell flat within the movie itself. 
 

I feel like the Split could've done well as a stand alone film with the following changes to the ending:


-At the end with Casey in the cage, she's unable to pull the trigger on the Beast, similar to how she didnt pull the trigger on her uncle in the flashback. 

-When the Beast sees her scars and deems her pure, Casey could have an epiphany or something (I can't think of one yet), and kills the Beast. This could show a better character arc for her. 

-Follows as is with the zoo worker finding her in the cage, calling the cops, and finding all of Kevin and the persona's stuff. 

-When the officer asks Casey if she's ready to go back to her uncle, as is, pan on Casey's face for a couple of seconds, then end.

I fucking hate the obvious racism of the lone black guy in the film. 

So casting specifically picked a black guy as the worker with the walkie talkie and he very specifically was a stupid character. Thinking his girl or some girl was playing, and was just aloof and ignorant. 

In a movie where there are no other black men with speaking parts it annoys me that the ONE black guy they get in a speaking role happens to be a fucking moron who could have saved those girls right then and there. 

And the casting director and M Night Shamalwyawlananan know this. They know what kind of person that guy is supposed to signify to us, as the audience. We are annoyed by him, we grown at his stupidity, we can recall images of what we think he looks like and the people he is friends with, etc.

After talking with her about it, the first part of the movie seems to be a masterpiece of amazing acting, and accurate portrayal of DID. The messages presented were encouraging in the sense that the disorder gained attention, and the therapist in the film was doing what she could to prevent the people suffering from it from being mislabeled as ""damaged"" or ""inferior"".  
  
Then, after all that, the ending (pretty much everything after the beast is revealed) destroys everything positive that the movie had been working toward. It sent the message that those with the disorder really are just animalistic beasts.

- Casey's entire arc seemed very predictable. The uncle being an abuser seemed obvious even before the scene where he stripped off. In addition, there's basically no reason to keep flashing back to it unless it's going to pay off. When you've got a guy going on about being 'pure' and never experiencing hardship for half the film...it was v obvious that being abused as a child was going to save her in this respect. 

- I found the ending v tiresome and a needless piece of fan service. If the majority of your audience (and it will be the majority) are sitting there going ""who the fuck is mr glass"" then it's a failure as a filmmaker to give a nod to a tiny percentage of your audience.

What am I missing here:

The first 99% of the movie that was pretty pointless: Guy with DID abducts 3 girls and they try to escape but it doesn't work. He transforms into a monster and kills 2 of them along with the doctor that's been helping him, but he feels sorry for the third one because she's had a rough life so he spares her. 

The last 1% of the movie that everyone talks about: Bad guy goes off thinking 'cool now I can turn into a monster what should I do with this neat trick?' Then Bruce Willis appears on screen and references a different movie that totally has nothing to do with this movie other than the fact that there might be a third movie that ties them together in the future.

Casey seemed like the protagonist the whole time but does absolutely nothing except try and fail to escape and get spared because the bad guy relates to her hardships. No character arc. She doesn't turn out to be the hero. Her hardships don't give her the strength to overcome her situation they just make the bad guy decide to leave her be. The viewer just has to assume that she's had a tiny bit of character growth at the end when she's thinking about telling the cop that her uncle abused her, but we don't get to see any character growth on screen. Not from her, or any other character for that matter. The other girls don't learn to be more empathetic of why she's different. They just die. If we're going to have a happy ending (which we sort of did because the protagonist survived) shouldn't it be because someone learned a lesson and not just because the antagonist took pity on one of three intended victims?

dcrpn7r,"Juvenile story-telling, terrible characters, non-existent plot, lame reference ending, over-hyped main character.

- Mcavoy's acting was not exceptional whatever any reviewer may say. He portrayed a posh English lady, a flamboyantly camp urban fashion designer, a 9 year old child (complete with stupid lisp etcetera) and an offish sinister male. I would suggest that in terms of acting range these are hardly pushing the envelope and to talk about Oscars is to over state the case. The characters he portrays are stilted and silly with a weird comic relief in the child character that jars continually (it's way over the top). An Oscar performance? How about a bit of fucking subtlety in any of the characters as portrayed. I assume that the story and script was written in big shitty red crayon by a teenager... 23 personalities and we get those caricatures? I'm surprised no two were remotely alike (jaded, cynical forty somethings that happen to be on different ends of the economic / political spectrum? Try portraying that without making the performance cartoony and we might be in the ball park of pointless film awards).

- Why were the girls that were abducted forced to their underwear? It made me laugh but what was the purpose? It had no real connection to anything and seemed to be simply for cheap thrills. I suppose it was in keeping with the juvenile and crappy storytelling that so many comic book type stories seem to gravitate towards. One of the girls is told to take off her top because it was dirty and the other her skirt - so they spend the rest of the film half naked. I'm pointing this out more as a ""you may as well have random, disconnected, non-Chekhov gun type moments throughout this film."" The nudity doesn't really add anything (minor vulnerability to the very fleshed out female roles?) to the sexual tension / vulnerability (from a thriller perspective) of any of their personalities. This is further fractured when the super natural element comes in - he likes to eat them and has no sexual inclinations at all - the high school nudity has apparently no bearing on the story. Just nudity for nudity's sake. All the characters may as well be naked from the start and it would have the same amount of sense or impact it has on the story - it would be just as in keeping with the jarring tone and disconnected themes. And would get as many people talking as the awesome ending.

- Why does the film go from seeming thriller to supernatural stupidity half way through? Both halves are equally shitty so I guess it makes no difference.

- The psychiatrist - I'm going to put this as pompously as I can: her only role was exposition of the narrative through extraordinarily crappy dialogue. She essentially functioned as a narrator as this Shyamalan cannot structure a story. There is an awful lot of ""well why didn't she do this"" *(which pops up constantly in these cheap and shitty comic book type films) so may as well wear a ""Plot Device Only"" sign around her neck the whole time.

* ""Well why didn't she do this"" - Dealing with an unstable chap who exhibits the following: extreme immaturity (can he care for himself - he lives below a fucking zoo in the maintenance pits and his psychiatrist knows this), instability, a lack of honesty and transparency, a danger to children and, murderous intent. She hears his multiple cries for help through emails etc and senses something amiss but is in turn remiss in her duty to report and get him the help he needs. But we should ignore this because she effectively functions as the narrator who tries to add something akin to depth to this shite. She also goes wandering to the rooms where the girls are locked away when she realises that Mcavoy is pretty mental and dangerous. Why tho?

- He lived in a zoo so this adds the perception of depth to Mcavoy's caricature personalities? Really? It's like the story was written by a child. A few people in the theatre actually chuckled in exasperation at the lack of pay off from that point on. 

- The abuse of the main female: crappy sub plot that ultimately adds nothing to the film. In the inevitably crappy sequel will she attempt to channel the abuse to take the enhancement qualities of this DIDs (trauma brings out additional strength etc) or whatever it is, without the negative impact? Really can't wait to see that, I mean the character development was really astonishing so really excited about that whole shtick. The film as a whole is as subtle as a hammer.

- What happened to decent (or at least believable and worthwhile) dialogue and proper exposition and story development? Flashbacks, narrators and those kinds of devices are so tired and come across as lazy structures for stories. It's certainly ""not Ibsen"" - not that you expect it to be but come on, is there any originality in this jamboree of titillating nonsense?

- The ending is crap. So it's connected to Unbreakable.. so what? Does that make up for the 117 minutes of awfulness you're subjected to? Why is making a reference or a knowing nod to any section of the audience a positive for a film? Is it not neutral at best? Knowing chuckles anywhere are plainly irritating. People chuckle or shout out there acknowledgement of getting the reference purely to signal understanding to others... but why? Irritates me but it'll be hard to chuckle through another two hours of this absolute guff. The Beast vs Bruce Willis - woopdy fucking do. This shared universe shit is crap and crossovers are the cheapest and most tawdry Hollywood tricks going. How about original storytelling and some actually proper connections between your shitty films?

I've been to the cinema once in the past 3 years and I remember why I don't bother any more - there is a total lack of decent storytelling that doesn't read like a teenagers creative writing exercise. So many films are devoid of any form of subtlety (obviously not all but this kind of cheap fodder definitely falls into that trap). These kinds of films just hammer home dumbed down shit for the majority of  audiences who wilfully subject themselves to this crap.

And a pre-emotive edit on tone: if you like it, you like it. All have different tastes, expectations and reasons for seeing a film - I only went to try and get into a girl. If you went and it was what you expected then good for you too.",5p1gqe

dcxzjjl,"It pretty much exploits mental illness and childhood sexual abuse. 

Best said by David Edelstein (the chief film critic for New York, graduated from Harvard in 1981):
""What I can’t figure out is why more people aren’t disgusted by how the Shyamster exploits the trauma of childhood sexual abuse for his own stupid, meretricious ends.""
""Though Shyamalan doesn’t use a lot of blood in Split — there’s barely any — his framing sexualizes the torture of the other two teenage girls in a way I found reprehensible. And his depictions of childhood sexual abuse are clinically accurate enough to make anyone with experience of such things feel sick.""

2. When the one girl goes through the vent in the ceiling, the other two ~~just stand there doing nothing~~ hold the door closed until Kevin breaks in. Once he realizes where Claire went, he runs after her. Why the fuck wouldn't the other two also go through the vent?

3. The therapist realizes that Dennis is going to kidnap and kill girls (and probably already has), but instead of going to the police she just decides to explore some locked doors.

dcs7uwd,"> Lots of people are brushing off the Unbreakable tie-in at the end as a simple easter egg, or something tacked last minute onto a totally unrelated film in a cheap attempt to rouse the Unbreakable fan-base.

While I admit you've made a believer out of me by pointing out the musical cue, I think people are ""brushing it off"" because in a lot of ways it's kind of lame (although, if there isn't a sequel and it really is just a cheeky easter egg, that may be even lamer). I understand why Unbreakable fans are excited, but it kind of takes away from the movie's success. Split's kind of just good as, well, Split, it shouldn't have to be ""Unbreakable 2"" for people to like it. I was happy enough just knowing the old M. Night is back. I mean shit, we already have a DC Superhero universe, and *two* Marvel Superhero Universes, do we really need an M. Night superhero universe?

I'm not saying the answer is ""no"", I'm just saying Split's a bit more than ""Unbreakable 2""

His powers derive from abuse and hatred, whereas Bruce Willis' derived from a sort of cosmic order to things. Both supernatural abilities are obviously derived from the same mysticism of the world though.

My take on the train was that Kevin mentions that his dad ""left him"", and later on in the movie he places flowers at a train station. My guess is that Kevin's dad was among those killed in the train crash featured in Unbreakable.

dcrs6jd,"I kind of liked that he didn't completely transform into a literal beast.  I mean, Unbreakable felt very grounded in reality (in the context of the superhero genre) that if he became something like what you're describing, it would lose some of that realism.

In Unbreakable, we never see Bruce Willis on screen holding together up a building to demonstrate his superhuman abilities.  Instead, we piece together the facts that he was the only survivor of a devastating train crash, he has never gotten sick, and he is able to lift ridiculous amounts of weight.  It's the subtlety of this plot and the fact that we don't see his limits as a superhuman that give Unbreakable that unique ""realism"" (remember the scene where his son wants to shoot him and we don't really know if he would survive).

While Split definitely pushes the bounds of that with Kevin literally being able to transform his body by will and being able to survive pointblank gunshot wounds, keeping Kevin as humanlike as possible definitely allowed the connection to Unbreakable to feel more organic.",5p1gqe

There was that really sincere moment where she was in his home at the end and explained that her patients are like her only family. I don't think she wanted there to actually be a Beast at all, she just knew he was keeping something from her and just wanted to know what was going on. Even until the very end, when she finds that girl I don't remember the name of on the ground in the closet, she immediately and directly tells him what he was doing was destructive and wrong.

She was naive in her faith that he could put his personalities in order if she empowered Kevin. This faith blinded her to the fact that he was capable of becoming The Beast, and unintentionally empowered Dennis and the coalition of his darker personalities. ",5p1gqe
dcpfayk,"She implied a couple times in the movie that DID are capable of becoming the highest form of humanity. But with Kevin I think she was truly trying to help him on a psychological level. You can see this by her trying to plead to Dennis that the beast is just a manifestation from his imagination based upon his dad leaving him/abuse from his mom.  

Also throughout the movie she manipulates Dennis because she can sense something is wrong. She jams the door and writes his name down for someone in a last ditch effort once she realizes things are worse than she thought. ",5p1gqe
dd09cjh,"It was unintentional, but there's no question that her method of therapy ultimately enabled the Beast's emergence.  Dennis' delight at her affirmation and the fact that the Beast actually emerged that night after, presumably, many years supports that read.  

To be sure, Kevin's abuse at the hands of his mother and loss of his father in a tragic accident contributed to the Beast's creation more than anything, but Fletcher's acceptance of Kevin and each of his personalities ultimately enabled the Beast's emergence.  And she should have known that this was a possibility given that she spent a lot of the movie trying to convince other professionals that DID sufferers had the ability to form gestalt personalities and could exhibit different physical characteristics depending upon which personality is in charge.",5p1gqe

dcxrrez,"If we look at Split similar to Unbreakable then one could argue it's not just a villain origin story, but a hero as well (Casey). I really like this theory because it shows how tragedy can have an individual go one way over the other. Kevin was abused by his mother, Casey was molested by her uncle. Both experienced severe mental and physical abuse at young ages yet Kevin developed DID and Casey developed a tougher exterior and mentality when confronting a crisis. I'm glad M. Night went the ambious way with what happens with Casey next. He didn't give into the Hollywood trope with her confronting her uncle and presumably killing him or getting him imprisoned. 

I like the idea that she'll eventually meet up with Dunn (every hero needs a sidekick) and take down The Horde once and for all. ",5p1gqe

Really neat, I guess, if you're into that stuff because if it is a villain origin story, it's extremely well done. But, I guess I went into the movie expecting a more profound conclusion. 

However, even though I absolutely detest the ending, I still thought it was an awesome movie.",5p1gqe

My understanding was that she did. When the police women says “your uncle is here” she just sits still, looking at the police women with her eyes welling up in tears. The police women asks her again. Then it cuts to the police women looking slightly shocked. Then next scene immediately cuts to a statue of a lion standing over its family. As if its protecting them (I believe this image could be symbolised as her confession to the police women about what had happened to her)",5p1gqe
ddcrk1s,"Finally had the chance to see the film so I apologize for commenting nearly two weeks later....

> Many people are saying this is a villain origin story but I saw Casey as the central character and her overcoming abuse as the story arc. Because of this, I found the ambiguity in her story's ending... ...to be off putting. 

What if, and hear me out as this is just a fun idea, but what if this is also her origin story as the *other type of villain*? 

In Unbreakable, Elijah's (Mr. Glass's) mom mentions that her son believes there are two types of villains; one type is the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, the other is the true threat - the brilliant evil archenemy - who battles the hero with his mind. It is also stated in Unbreakable that you can always spot the villains in comic books by looking at their eyes. Their eyes are bigger to show they see the world from a different perspective. 

Now, I completely believe that Mr. Glass falls into this ""true threat"" evil archenemy category. That's obvious from Unbreakable. 

But...

Maybe Casey felt empowered when The Beast acknowledged her ""brokenness"" as something to glorify. Maybe she feels a little vindictive towards everyone she's been trying to avoid for so long, too. And, maybe, there's a little something more to her getting in trouble at school on purpose. Casey's eyes are quite big and her perspective on the entire situation her and the other girls are in is different because of her past... 

Again, I realize it's a huge, fanciful, ill-founded stretch but, just maybe, her story isn't finalized. ",5p1gqe

But Casey's character was wearing layers for both emotional and practical reasons, to deter her uncle and to act as an emotional shield from other people.

Because of her trauma and struggle, she has had to grow emotional layers of protection, where the other girls haven't, and I thought the shedding of the clothes expressed that.",5p1gqe

Two things bugged me though:

1. Shyamalan needs help writing dialog. Not the important bits, but the *un*important bits. Like when Dr. Fleischer was talking to that other woman, and the woman was yelling at the TV set. The way he always films dialog that's not essential to the plot feels wooden and awkward. I don't know that I can truly describe it, but I can *tell* when it's a Shyamalan movie just from the character interactions. They feel so off. Always. For the best example, watch any of the characters chatting in *The Village*, and never mind the fact that they do not use contractions for some reason. Also, speaking of that, he loves to give strange character quirks to people for no real reason, like the boy in *The Village* who hated getting his shirts wrinkled, or Abigail Breslin leaving glasses of water around the house in *Signs* (seriously, did nobody in that house ever do the dishes? How did they have so many glasses just sitting around?)

2. Throughout the film, we got the flashbacks of Casey's uncle molesting her, and her learning to use a shotgun, but after all that, when she's escaped, the uncle comes to take her home. She's going back into the arms of the man who molested her. There was a prolonged silence and a look between her and the female officer who told her that her uncle was there to take her home, but no indication that she was finally going to report him for the things he'd done. I would have preferred some closure on that.",5p1gqe

I can't remember anything, but I'm wondering if Dennis had some minor issue with water that was not a focus, but slid in somewhere.

The biggest, striking difference is Dennis' enjoyment of watching ""naked young girls dance"" or however it was stated.

My personal opinion here, obviously, but I wish Shyamalan would have made the connection more subtle/graceful. For example, (I'll try and spitball a scene off the top of my head):

Lose the news anchor explanation in the diner and have David Dunn showing up at the crime scene at the zoo and the cops telling him to back off. But instead of backing off he finds a way into the zoo and sees Casey. If she's actually *different* like the movie implied the whole time, she should be able to recognize that Dunn is like her, in a way.

The final act of this movie is some of the most cringeworthy shit I've ever seen, and for Shyamalan to then try and justify all the campiness by being like ""oh by the way, this is actually a supervillain movie now"" is the sign of some absolutely dogshit screenwriting.

Idk, i think it was unnecessary in many regards. 

Also i would like to point out, that while it is normal for in movies like this for the main actors to be retarded, but there was an extra dosage of retardism in this film, oh my fucking god.

Based on the rules of this universe the heroes and villains must be opposite. She was level headed through this entire experience, with the exception of the part where she was crying in the bedroom. This is because she was abused her entire life.

I equate this moment in a way to David Dunn and the pool (I just saw it and have to watch it again but the idea is ""pick yourself up and try again"".

I believe she is Kevin's complete opposite. She is collected where he is unhinged. She solves problems and deals with her issues herself where as he has created the personalities to help him. She is whole where he is broken.

The change was first shown when she was able to pull the trigger on The Beast, where she was unable to do it to her uncle, who was a different kind of beast (they used to play ""animals"") as a little girl.

The part with the cop was to symbolize that she understands what she is capable of. When she stares at the cop it is implied that there is an understanding. She is going to speak up this time. Thus ending this lifelong struggle of being a victim and completing her arc.",5p1gqe

ddebhox,"I'm diagnosed with one of the most stigmatized mental illnesses in the world and I like Split and think it has a special underlying message for those of us who live with disorders and have suffered childhood abuse and trauma. I'm opening my comment like this 'cause I wanna make it clear I know first-hand exactly how stigma affects one's life, and how media does in fact add to it at times despite some people pretending like media has no affect on anything.

This part of the article is spot on: ""I’ve spoken with a handful of active members of the mental health community who feel the film is harmful, stigmatizing and totally insensitive… but they haven’t actually seen it for themselves."" Of the others I know active in mental health advocacy, only one has actually watched or bothered to read a detailed plot description of Split. They came out still not liking it much but with a softer approach, less dismissive and hateful of the movie than before. Largely thanks to the scene where the Beast connects with Casey.

""I am my own hero"" is a motivational phrase I've seen and like to use for myself. It's for those of us who've experienced trauma and had to live with this and we look at it as making us stronger. It doesn't mean we're super nice, forgiving, gentle, and artistic. It means we survived and are still surviving. I'm the strongest person I've ever known. Kevin's (how I refer to the main character typically) the broken are more evolved line of thought really resonated with me, it was powerful and I attached my heart's wings to it. I like him, honestly. I feel like he's about as well created as a ""villainous"" mentally ill character is going to get in film. Excluding the alters like Dennis and the supervillain Beast, Kevin's actually pretty relatable.

If you watch this interview, you'll see it's clear Shyamalan and McAvoy both had at least a clue as to what DID entails and I can tell they have a respect for neurodivergency. McAvoy immediately corrects himself as one point when he says something that implies the structural dissociation in the backbone of DID is a choice, fixing his phrasing to make it clear it's not. I notice details like that, they're important! [Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IX0yXvfbd4)

Yes, I was feeling greysky about this movie when all that was out were the trailers. When it was released I went to find a detailed plot summary and was in shock by what I read and then my fullblown interest Split took off from there. I've been obsessed with this movie since then and to let you in, it makes me droopy to see it getting bashed. I understand why people still dislike it after watching it. For some, it's inexcusable to take Kevin and make the unrealistic Beast alter and pose him as a supervillain. Also the section where he tells Casey to kill him is a very deep and personal subject in mental health where suicidal ideation is a norm and every day forward is cause for sunspot lighting, I know that scene is upsetting as is the end of Dr. Fletcher 'cause she was all in all a good professional.

(Lex Luthor, Joker, Norman Osborn, ect)

Yellow is Kevin's color, in comicbooks this color is usually associated with mentally unstable villains. Reverse Flash, Sinestro, ""The Yellow Bastard"", ect.

And it does not mean that Casey was abused every day because she was placed in his guardianship. I was under the guardianship of my abuser for 8 years total; the abuse occurred several times a month for a period of time, only to taper off, and then begin again any time later. I lived in a constant state of high alert, not knowing when the next assault would occur.. This pattern went on for three years before I was just not viewed as a person in the household any longer, and was completely ignored like I did not exist.

[I can't disagree with you about the execution, though.

I mean, with Unbreakable, we got two sides of the same coin: the ""unbreakable"" guy, Dunn, and then Mr. Glass, the guy who shatters easily.


Now we have Barry/The Beast/The Horde, a guy with multiple personalities, one of which just happens to be a supervillain (or maybe his powers go further than that?), but we don't have his opposite.


What would be the opposite of someone with multiple personality disorder? Someone with an higher consciousness and sense of ""self""? Like, the frickin' *One*? Someone ring Keanu Reeves pls... nah just kidding :).


It's also extremely far-fetched, but remember the Dr.'s talk about how some personalities were physically different? With the blind woman being able to see and such?


Well, if Casey could change the body of others, not just his own (extremely unlikely though), he could certainly heal Mr. Glass!

""Personally, I believe that Casey has powers more than just being able to read people. I think she sees and feels other people's thoughts and experiences. I believe that the flashbacks shown throughout the movie were not her own, but that she was experiencing Kevin's. They depict the physical abuse he experienced at the hands of his mother and the sexual abuse at the hands of his Uncle. His uncle would even make them pretend to be animals(beasts), which I think is the true origin of the Beast.
Most of the flashbacks shown are from Casey's perspective (presumably), but there is one flashback that we know is actually Kevin's. It depicts him hiding from his mom under the bed. Why is this lone flashback shown in the first person rather than 3rd person? I think it was to obscure from the viewer who was actually experiencing it. It would have revealed that it was the same child in all of the flashbacks.
Although the Uncle and Dad refer to Casey by name multiple times, it is possible that they are actually saying KC (short for Kevin Crumb).
I believe that Casey can therefore see and feel the experiences (particularly pain) of the people around her. This would explain why she always prefers to be alone. It explains why she Is able to read people so well. She knows how Kevin's persona is thinking and feeling which is why she never really seems to be afraid of him except at the end when he becomes the Beast.
The scars that are revealed on Casey's body at the end are not the scars of abuse, or even self inflicted scars. They are the scars of wounds experienced by people around her. The cuts on her stomach are the cuts the Marsha received from Kevin with the kitchen knife. The other scars on her torso look like shot gun blast (a result of Casey shooting the Beast).
It is this reason that the Beast leaves her alone. He realizes she is like him. His thoughts can manifest in his body and physically change him into the Beast. Casey's thoughts (the pain and suffering of others) can manifest in her body as well.
Like Elijah and David Dunn, Kevin and Casey are like two sides of the same coin. I know it's kind of out there, but I think it's a possibility given Shyamalan's love of misdirection.""",5p1gqe

This movie does a whole lot of effort to get you trying to solve the puzzle on cliche split-personaltiy movie rules. It draws connections between Kevin and Casey (being abused as a child and having to live with the abuser, the animal motives: the emerging beast/her uncle ""playing animal""/the zoo) and for the main part of the movie you're supposed to be thinking the beast is being just made up by the two split personalities Dennis and Patricia to gain power over the other ones, especially Barry who is the one who calls the personalities into the light. So you're supposed to be thinking, you are watching a stereotype split-personality thriller.

But the ""twist"", if you can call it like this, is that you're not watching this genre, by revealing that this all is set up in the world of the comic flick *Unbreakable* (""Mr Glass""). The reveal is, that you basicly watched a supervillain origin story. The beast is not happening in someones head. It's really there and the movie was about how this supervillain came to be.

After thinking so much about this movie, this will probably disappoint you, but that's pretty much all to it.

---

**edit:** Maybe I can shine a little light for you on your points, I think that would be fair to you.

> So, by the beginning of the movie (...)

The whole sequence that gets Casey into the car is because the movie needed an explanation on why she's abducted. Kevin was watching the other two girls for days, to make sure they are the untroubled persons the beast wants to feast on. Casey doesn't match as a prey animal, she's by-catch. That's also the reason why the beast does let her go in the end when it sees her scars.

> Another fact to look up here is the scene where Casey first talks to Hedwig (...)

Casey does know how to deal with Hedwig for the same reasons she tells Marcia too pee herself in order to prevent her rape. She's calm and knows how to handle such situations. Because she's been there, remember, she's not untroubled (which also makes her the superior human in the beasts eyes).

Maybe I should stop here, this is becoming a wall of text. Maybe from here on it could be fun to figure out the movie for yourself on a second watch.

The other two girls were well off girls who never faced a problem in their life and as such were seen as soft and weak.  When he called her pure hearted he was referring to the fact that she was damaged.

So in case you've not seen it. In Unbreakable, the twist is that Bruce Willis (the guy at the end of the movie) is immune to damage (hence the name). The way the twist plays out is that the villain, Mr. Glass, was causing devastating accidents to occur, and the one where he finds Bruce Willis is a train wreck.

I inferred, that Kevin's (James McAvoys character) dad was on the train and was killed. This was the first traumatic event for Kevin, and where I assumed the ""Beast"" was created. 

Then, Dennis and I assume Patricia were created in Kevin's head too, since they've been around since he was 3 years old according to Dennis. 

Then, further trauma from his mother caused others to form in his head, like Barry and so on.

So to trigger the beast, he returned to the train station where he probably saw his dad last. And I'm betting 1000% if you rewatched Unbreakable the flowers have something to do with that film.

We can probably assume that Mr Glass' trial was a major media circus. Given the fact that he'd committed acts of terrorism that had killed hundreds of innocent people. Considering both movies take place in Philadelphia, it's entirely possible for a random dinner patron to comment on it given the fact that the news gives a weird name to the killer.

(Where I live there was a shooting a local McDonald's that killed a dozen people or so, people still mention it when you talk about that specific McDonald's and the shooting was decades ago.)

I enjoyed Split on it's own. Remove Bruce Willis' scene at the end, and the movie loses nothing.

However...the Beast is still free at the end of the movie. I don't have a problem with that kind of open ending, but I also don't have a problem with potentially tying this character into Unbreakable 2.

I know *nothing* about Unbreakable 2, and learned of it's existence literally minute ago within this thread. That being said, who better than Bruce Willis' character to bring down the beast? The Beast is inhumanely strong...so is Bruce Willis. Also, Bruce Willis is apparently nearly invulnerable to all things except drowning in water, so I see potential for one HELL of a fight between these 2: Super strong nearly invulnerable beast vs super strong nearly invincible man.

I can buy a storyline where Bruce Willis has become some kind of pseudo superhero reading newspapers as, Sam Jackson had once described, to find clues about supervillains, and tracking them down in a similar fashion to Jackson seeking out his ""lone survivor""s.

She had to come in a more subtle, meticulous, and cunning way to bring out Dennis, who was working with Patrichia to suppress Kevin. Dennis was emotionally stronger than all the other identities and was protecting Kevin, or as Dennis believed he was- as the doctor new. The Beast, the 24th identity was just a misjudgment on her part of it's meaning. Her unraveling of the identities was her job to protect Kevin from the delusion of the identities wanting to collectively take over as the beast in the form of a collective intelligence reborn as one. Simply ""curing"" the disease is like trying to cure schizophrenia, it can't be done, but unlike schizophrenia, Kevin's disease could be unraveled or reversed.  I think. I'm no expert.

Bruce Willis' character, David Dunn, survives a train accident that kills everyone on board, except for him. Elijah reaches out to David and tries to convince him that David is a superhero. Upon further investigation by Elijah and further testing of his strength by David, it's discovered that David is essentially ""unbreakable"". Elijah assists David in developing his skills, which also includes being able to sense the crimes that people have committed by touching them. 

At the end of the movie, it's revealed that Elijah orchestrated a series of terrorists attacks in an attempt to find someone opposite to him. He found that in David when he survived the train accident, which Elijah set up. This reveal happened when Elijah offered a handshake to David. In this revelation, Elijah found his purpose in life, which was to be the villain to David's hero. Elijah is then arrested and committed into an institution for the criminally insane.

In Split, it's revealed at the end that the movie takes place in the same universe as Unbreakable and that the antagonist of the film is still alive and it's alluded to that he will become a villain for a potential sequel - with David Dunn being the hero.

Yes, this is correct. The point is raised a few times in the film that each personality can go so far as to have it's own body chemistry.

Kevin (or rather, his personas) believe so hard they create ""The Beast"", the ultimate form of protection because he is literally indestructible, and he can instil fear in those who are seeking to mock Kevin. One of Kevin's other personas, Jade, is diabetic and requires insulin.

I just finished watching it for the first time, and got really into it so I wanted to read more about it and of course the connections to Split, and in this [interview](http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/20/split-m-night-shyamalan-ending-interview/) he mentions that Kevin from Split was originally in the script for Unbreakable, and that he knew before writing the script for Split that it would reference Unbreakable in some way. 

> ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you strike upon the idea to set Split in the same story universe as David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) and Unbreakable?

>M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN: Oh, it was always there. Always. This character, Kevin from Split, was in the original script of Unbreakable. The original draft of Unbreakable focused on David Dunn and Elijah as his mentor. Elijah tells him, “You’re a comic book character, go try it.” And instead of bumping into the Orange Suit Man, David bumps into one of Kevin’s personalities and goes to save the girls. So you’d have been watching the girls side of it the whole time. That was the outline.

>And how much of that screenplay had you written?

>A lot. Some of the Kevin Wendell Crumb [James McAvoy’s character in Split] scenes were already completely written, all the way back then. One of the “Patricia” scenes, the Hedwig introduction scene, those were written over 15 years ago. I have them written by hand in my notebooks.

>So when you began writing the full script for Split, you knew it was going to reference Unbreakable?
Yes, for sure.

Unbreakable and Split are just origin stories for the Hero/Villain of the third movie, *Glass*.

Edit: I see you've gotten this reply a few times. Sorry to beat a dead horse in my excitement!",5p1gqe
dgmclr9,"I felt the reference was really well done with the bouquet scene and the Beast surging when Kevin's dad entered a train and never returned.

These werent just random girls. I believe they were the 2 girls that sexually teased him and ran away on the school trip that DR referred to.
Casey was not part of that.

Casey was an abused girl that showed symptoms of  distrust of people and seclusion while others had no idea what was happening to her over the years and just thought she was antisocial and creepy.

She tried to use her mind and her reasoning ability(as she had probably had to do some nights with her uncle to avoid abuse). She probably has poor success in the past with her uncle physically  challenging him......so she preferred to use her mind. She knows the consequences of physically challenging a sick man and losing.

Both the characters have similar backstories but they are 100% not the same person. ",5p1gqe
dcrxfpm,"Interesting theory, but I don't think Casey/Kevin were connected. I think she just adapted to the circumstances better than Claire or Marsha, and that's why it may seem like she was ""different"". If you think about it, she never really did anything too drastic-except for slapping Hedwig; but even then, she didn't try to run away or escape the underground chamber, unlike Claire or Marsha. 

Up until the last 10 or so minutes of the movie, the Beast was going to kill her. There's no doubt about that. If he didn't have a desire to kill her, he wouldn't have attacked her in the corridor and certainly wouldn't have begun to eat her leg. I'm not sure what exactly the reasoning was for him actually physically eating the other girls was, but maybe he believed it made him more powerful.

dct6o64,"I think the main theme comes from something Dr. Fletcher said. I don't remember exactly, but she was debating with some dude. She said something along the lines of ""What if the things that break us aren't actually bad, what if they make us better than everyone else?"" I think this villain is supposed to parallel Mr. Glass. Mr. Glass is broken and deeply flawed but that's exactly what created him as a super villain. Kevin was abused and that's exactly what motivates ""the hoard"" into becoming ""the beast."" His whole philosophy is that no one can reach their true potential unless they're broken, that's why he wants to kill the girls, that's why he spared the protagonist, and that's why he believes himself capable of becoming the beast. If M Night wants to make a Cinematic Universe, I can definitely see how Kevin and Mr. Glass would team up.",5p1gqe
ddhashl,And Dr. Fletcher is the mad scientist who planted the seeds of the beast in her experimental treatment of her patient.

I think the kidnapper and older lady know Casey's imperfection and possibly her past. They figure she will be safe from the beast because the beast tends to eat the stomach, which so happens to be the place she's has the most scars.

I think the significance of the flowers is to convey innocence and Purity which is what the Beast likes to feed upon. I think I will have to revisit the movie Unbreakable because I I'm now intrigued about your interpretation of the train crash.

I think the reason that the video diaries were on the computer was a simple way to ensure that the audience was able to connect all the dots. One thing I've noticed that the director likes to do is to inject various ideas throughout the movie in which he will then explain and tie them all together simultaneously at the end of the movie. Like many of his movies this was quite an intellectual movie and I think he was simply adding the short snippet videos to help the more handicapped people in the audience.

dd0evg4,"Point-by-point:

>I went to an 11:30am showing and apparently they don't show trailers that early at AMC so I missed the opening. When I sat down the girls were already kidnapped and Dennis was sitting down and then took out the one girl to either rape her or make her dance or whatever

You only missed 3-5 minutes of the intro. It was pretty much the kidnapping part and the girls spending a moment in the room after waking up.

>I usually don't like watching movie or TV trailers too much but the Split trailers definitely showed too much. A lot of the tension was removed from some scenes and I think part of that was because of the trailers while part of that was just average film-making. I just watched Prisoners about a month ago and the difference in tension and urgency was staggering between the two.

I don't watch traliers so I can't comment on this.

>People kept telling me there was a great twist that I'd never guess. 1) I've never seen Unbreakable so Bruce Willis showing up at the end did nothing for me. 2) I kept thinking there was some twist during the movie so I was overanalyzing things expecting a typical M. Night twist but nothing would have really made sense. 3) Even after googling, the ""twist"" isn't even really a twist as it doesn't change much, then again I haven't seen Unbreakable like I said so maybe there's more I'm missing.

1) If you'd watch *Unbreakable* you'd understand that the ""twist"" is that the movie isn't actually a psychological horror/thriller but a superhero film (in this case a supervillain origin story). Just imagine watching *Predator* only to discover in the last few minutes of the film that it isn't a action film but instead a harlequin romance movie. It changes the tone of the movie. 2) This is really on you. You put yourself in the position to overanalyze the movie, not MNS. Don't blame MNS or the movie for this. 3) I agree, it's more of a reveal. People put this meme that MNS always has twist endings, but most of tge supposed twists aren't really twists. Also, watch *Unbreakable* because it's a very, very good film.

>The flashbacks were way too heavy foreshadowing, by about the 2nd one you could easily predict where they were going. Should have either been all at once near the end of the movie or spread out better.

I didn't think so, instead I thought by the end they were mostly used to show that a) Casey is ""pure"", b) mostly as red herrings to throw the audience off about the final showdown, and c) as a way to explain some of the main characters strange behaviors like peeing on yourself when being sexually attacjed or wearing lots of layers. That being said, everyone processes information and comes to different conclusions. So you may have just got what you got while I didn't see that.

>I find it a tiny bit unrealistic that nobody else picked up what Kevin was doing considering he was right under the zoo the entire time. No other maintenance guys? Nobody questioned where he slept? He managed to drag 3 girls in there without security picking it up? Maybe some of this was better explained in the start of the movie that I missed.

IIRC, the area he kept them in was abandoned long ago by the zoo. That's why they never noticed it.

>So the Beast targets people who haven't experienced suffering and eats them to gain power or something? How could he tell that the two other girls didn't have any trauma or abuse of their own, a bit too convenient that Casey had visible scars. Additionally wouldn't the Beast's intimidation give the other two girls enough trauma that they'd be strong enough and he shouldn't eat them?

The Beast/Patricia had Dennis follow the girls for quite sometime before the kidnapping. He basically knew their lifestyle, habits, and schedules. He didn't pick those two at random. As for Casey, she was just in the wrong place because she didn't want to go home to her step dad and gave a false excuse about his car breaking down (see point 1). It's also implied that those two girls are the ones that sexually assaulted Kevin by having him place his hands on their breasts on a dare prior to the events of the film - which in turn kicked off the Hoard into taking control to unleash the Beast.

As for the last sentence, the Beast is also a fanatical devout. It's fairly easy for a person like that to break their own morals/laws for those who aren't initiated. Some of the logical gymnastics the Beast might have preformed to come to the conclusion are: that his actions don't constitute purify the girls. Kidnapping as a whole doesn't purify someone (it may only be just extensive abuse (though kidnapped, the girls were never actually put through any physical/mental/emotional abuse and the captors treated them like a zoo does to an animal). Or, to unleash the Beast the girls and Kevin had to undergo some sort of ritual (ritual as in a set of often repeated actions that have a great emphasis put on them like washing your hands before dinner) and once that's underway, as long as the harm inflicted on the sacrifice (i.e. the girls) isn't too severe they aren't considered purified. I know it doesn't make sense, but Kevin is insane and expecting sane behavior from an insane person is insane.

>Maybe other people think differently but the Beast being a real thing was kind of a let down to me, I can suspend my belief about the 23 different personalities but being able to eat shotgun bullets just by believing was crossing the line slightly. Additionally, what was up with buying flowers and stuff?

For the first part, scroll back up to were I explain the ""twist"", so Kevin having ridiculous superpowers is par for the course. As for the second part, if you watch *Unbreakable* you'd find that David Dunn (the main character) begins his discovery after being the sole (and unharmed) survivor of a devastating train crash. In *Split*, we are informed that Kevin's dad left on a train, hence why the Beast live their. 

The implication is that Kevin's dad died on the same train crash the thematic connection being that the same disaster that created a hero also created a monster, and is further enforced by *Unbreakable's* rules with the hero and villain being connected. If Kevin's dad didn't die on the train crash, then the flowers are just a memorial for the last place he ever saw his dad.

>Overall it was enjoyable but I was definitely let down and had some nagging gripes.

I hope that answered a few of your gripes.

>Edit: I also forgot that it gave a hilariously bad reason to have teenage girls walk around in their underwear

Dennis likes watching teenage girls dance naked/seminaked (you walked in just as he was trying to do that). It's obvious that his varying and asinine reasons to strip the girls down are just his way of trying to fulfill his fantasy without being able to actually indulge it.

If you're saying that was the bad reason to get the girls to take their clothes off, then I say to each his own. I didn't think it was incredibly genious, but it wasn't a stupid or extremely bad way to do it.",5p1gqe

He managed to drag 3 girls in there without security picking it up? Maybe some of this was better explained in the start of the movie that I missed.

I belive near the beginning he said something to his therapist about them letting him live down there for some reason.  Didn't catch exactly what he said, but yeah I agree that is a bit stupid.  For a movie with a supernatural angle that was actually one of the most unbelievable parts.

>So the Beast targets people who haven't experienced suffering and eats them to gain power or something? How could he tell that the two other girls didn't have any trauma or abuse of their own, a bit too convenient that Casey had visible scars. Additionally wouldn't the Beast's intimidation give the other two girls enough trauma that they'd be strong enough and he shouldn't eat them?

That's actually a really good point.  His reasoning opens up a lot of questions, for example if those scars were just her cutting herself due to severe depression would that be 'enough' to warrant her being 'pure', or does he only count abuse by others or something..?  

Another thing that really bothered me about that ending is Dennis made her change shirts like 4 times...Even if you say that he didn't notice/care because he was a different personality you'd think that seeing those scars would trigger some sort of reaction to make him realize that she's 'pure', especially since Dennis kept talking about how much he agrees with the beast's philosophy.

>Maybe other people think differently but the Beast being a real thing was kind of a let down to me, I can suspend my belief about the 23 different personalities but being able to eat shotgun bullets just by believing was crossing the line slightly. Additionally, what was up with buying flowers and stuff?

Not sure about the flowers either but I actually didn't mind the supernatural element.  I know a lot of people hate on movies like Lucy or whatever with pseudo science but they're movies, the way I see it if you want it to be a complete 1:1 ratio of the science/psychology it's based on you shouldn't be watching in the first place.  Filmmakers deserve to have some creative freedom even if it sometimes is kind of hacky.

All that said I agree with you mostly.  I thought the movie had some interesting ideas but it ultimately kind of fumbled around too much.  The performances from Mackavoy and the main girl were good, the Therapist was pretty good too, the other two girls were pretty lacking but with them being secondary characters I suppose it doesn't matter much.

I also haven't seen Unbreakable so the ending did nothing but confuse me.  Even if I had seen it though, I feel like I still would have been disappointed.  Here I was thinking we got an original movie, something that's surprisingly rare these days, but nope it was a sequel in disguise.  It just felt like I was kind of betrayed.  Not sure if Unbreakable had a similar tone to this one, I had heard that it was a bit more like an actual superhero movie, not necessarily cheesy, but conveyed that it's fiction very early on.  If that's the case it makes the serious slightly more realistic tone of this film all the more frustrating because that means he was really trying to lead us astray.

I'm just getting really sick of every movie just being a lead in to another upcoming movie.  We never get closure anymore, nothing is a self-contained story at the box office it's like someone reading a book to you and stopping for days between each chapter which all end on cliff hangers.  After the 100th chapter you just want it to end, especially since when you change to a different book it had the same issue.

I did enjoy the movie, but I recognized aspects of Milligan's case five minutes into the movie, and it's very clear that it was based on him, and that seems a little shitty. It would be like making a movie about the retarded man executed by Texas, somehow surviving and gaining super strength and dedicating his life to vengeance upon the state.

So yeah, the tortured individual you feel bad for? He was real, and is an uncredited ""Based On.""

I think the most fucked up part is that in real life, Milligan's powerful 24th personality was a Teacher, rather than a fucking Beast.

I've not seen Split, but the fact that he's made the equivalent of a villain origin story (Again, without any constraints and stands alone as a good film) is what Marvel or DC should have maybe done to be more interesting. Although on the other hand maybe there's a lot of that in the TV shows like Daredevil etc. I've not seen them.",5p1gqe
dcqnlzc,"Haven't seen this movie yet, but going from *Unbreakable?* Not really. The motivation for David Dunn to become a superhero was literally ""Hey, you know how you're strong and tough? You should totally fight crime."" You may be overly familiar with Peter Parker's reluctance to stop a criminal leading to his uncle Ben getting killed and motivating him to use his powers for the good of others, or Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered as a child, but those are much better motivations even when played straight. 

But then *Unbreakable* wasn't a superhero movie. It was both marketed and played like a supernatural thriller in the vein of *The Sixth Sense.* The audience wasn't meant to accept Dunn as a hero and just wait for him to start fighting crime like in *Spider-Man* or *Batman Begins*. They were supposed to wonder how this dude survived a train crash. Was there really a reasonable explanation? If there isn't, is there a supernatural explanation that doesn't involve superpowers (I'm sure a lot of people were expecting another ""dead all along"" after *The Sixth Sense*)? In a way, the fact that the superhero origin story was played straight was kind of the twist. 

On the other hand, probably because these origins are so well known, Marvel and DC (okay, mostly Marvel these days...) are doing a lot more with the genre. In the last two *Captain America* films we saw Cap deal with the moral complexities of warrantless surveillance and ""suspected terrorist registry"" analogues. *Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice* was also *trying* to address concerns about vigilantism and accountability, though I don't think the characters ever really dealt with Batman's bad habit of branding people so much as just assumed he would stop after [Superman dies](#spoiler).

But lastly, and most importantly, this is and was marketed as fiction. It may have been ""inspired"" by true events, but it is a work of fiction. It has no obligation to depict reality, it has one obligation: To entertain.

The endings to these films feel open ended and incomplete, which is fitting because life is incomplete and rarely has nice conclusions and wrap ups, but rather life just keeps going. With that in mind the endings make sense because the films are about super heros in real life.

But then at the end of the day it is ok if you didn't like or understand the film. Do go watch unbreakable though.",5p1gqe

However, I'm not sure if this is the case. Based on the rules of this universe the heroes and villains must be opposite. She was level headed through this entire experience, with the exception of the part where she was crying in the bedroom. I equate this moment in a way to David Dunn and the pool (I just saw it and have to watch it again but the idea is ""pick yourself up and try again"").

The point I am trying to make is that I think she is his opposite. She is collected where he is unhinged. She solves problems herself where as he has created the personalities to help him.  She is whole where he is broken (split. eh? eh???).

The part with the cop was to symbolize that she understands what she is capable of.  When she stares at the cop it is implied that there is an understanding. She is going to speak up this time. Thus ending this lifelong struggle of being a victim and completing her arc.

dcv9kml,"I'm pretty certain Kevin did think that, whether she will or not? Who knows, I just don't think her uncle will survive another film.",5p1gqe
dcvy74h,"It's NOT that people develop DiD and manifest powers. The whole shtick in this universe is that trauma may cause powers to develop. Kevin just happens to have DiD.

With that being said, I wonder if Casey will develop any kind of power. ",5p1gqe
dctvfbz,"the kidnapping was well planned with 2 specific girls chosen that proved themselves to be unclean by their behavior. Well planned for months where construction work had to be done in rooms to prepare them.
Casey was a fly in the ointment, She wasnt even supposed to be there. There was no greater plan for casey. She almost was killed.

Since you cannot inflict multiple personalty diseases on people like giving them Herpes......i dont think the Beast is scheming to  recruit her as a DID patient. It doesnt work that way.",5p1gqe
dcvhtgq,"I'm kind of in that same line of thinking, however I don't think she would necessarily develop DID. I think she might just get her own ""ability"" that is, like Kevin, birthed by her abuse all these years. 

In the same way that Dunn and Mr Glass are on opposites sides of the same curve (as Elijah says in Unbreakable), I believe she would have something that relates to what Kevin has evolved to. 

Although, having said that, I kind of don't want them to ""connect"" their powers anymore than they already have because that would make the only 4 ""super powered"" people in this universe connected to the train derailment in Unbreakable. 

Elijah ~~Glass~~ Price (thanks /u/serujiow), who masterminded the train derailment, has a disorder where his bones break very easily. David Dunn is Unbreakable and survives the train derailment. Kevin Crumb is ""broken/split"" as a child, to a greater extent when his father dies in the train derailment, which in turn leads him to be virtually Unbreakable. Casey Cooke is....?!??.. and is related to the derailment how?!?!  

She would work best in a 3rd movie either developing her own unique power or like another poster in this thread mentioned, have her be the sidekick to David Dunn since Kevin won't immediately harm her, as she is pure, and she probably is the current expert with regards to Kevin's alters and The Horde now that Dr Fletcher is dead. 

So all in all, I have no fucking clue but I'll definitely be lining up for ""Unbreakable 3"".  ",5p1gqe

-- Spoilers below --

Superheroes are people gifted above human abilities through a kind of evolutionary/spiritual fluke.  Like David Dunn's [strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dKqDevrFF4), invulnerability and [psychic visions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utMjBw3mz3Y). People with these powers have a innate desire to use them, even if not aware they have them. (In David Dunn's case he was a ""natural protector"" at his security guard job... much like The Beast is towards other personalities.)

If you then pay attention in Split, Dr. Fletcher mentions some people with dissociative identity disorder have altered their abilities with the power of their mind when one of their personalities asserted itself.

This means that The Horde/Beast uses the same powers as David does in Unbreakable. He's a natural protector gifted extra human strength. He's just unstable and therefore ""protecting"" the wrong people (Kevin's other personalities and other mentally ""damaged"" people like Casey).

There is also a theme running through Unbreakable about these powered people needing to find their purpose. Something we see Kevin's different personalities struggling with in Split.",5p1gqe
dddcea4,this theory with the insulin has been posted before and tbh it makes total sense... the horde probably tricked that persona into thinking she has diabetes... very smart,5p1gqe

We know from the start that he won't touch them, so every time he shows there's no reason to be scared.

DC has fucked up all their opportunities at a dark superhero universe. Marvel is going strong in the middle of the road on action/adventure vs dark (between their Netflix originals and movie franchises), but the universe is too sprawling at this point to get into a real gritty, character driven franchise. Not to mention that their heavy handed use of the Deus ex Machina means that every new movie is going to become exponentially more grand.

dde5kjw,"I think you may have misinterpreted a few things based on your questions so maybe hearing a different POV may help you appreciate the resolution a little more. 

&nbsp;

The character arc for Casey is incredibly empowering. There is nothing saying that being molested is a good thing, or that the ending means she is going home to suffer with her uncle.  

&nbsp;

**I'll begin with a response to your second question:** We're not supposed to side with the beast. Her molestation as a child is unacceptable, so the fact that the beast thinks her childhood tragedy was a good thing that ""enlightened"" her **should** give you an idea of just how mentally messed up and dangerous this horde/entity is. He wants people to suffer and now he is loose the world...  

&nbsp;

**As for your first question:** Casey at the end is no longer a victim. The movie shows us in the flashback that she fell victim to molestation as a child, and when she was pointing the gun at her uncle, she literally couldn't pull the trigger. Now, jump to the end of the movie, as shes cornered in the cage and the beast is coming for her, she now overcomes being a victim by ""pulling the trigger"" - she literally shoots the beast - twice.  

&nbsp;

So at the very end, Casey, in that police car, is changed. The look on her face says it all - she's not going back to her uncle as an incapacitated victim, but as an enabled survivor - one that can ""pull the trigger"". She's going to face her demon head on. Whether that means turning her uncle in/ making him confess/killing him - who knows? It's open ended for you to decide. But she;s going to be ok because she's a survivor.  

&nbsp;

Hopefully this makes you hate the ending less?

I do agree that good movies are ones where the character has growth. However how can we expect people to be inspired if the audience cannot identify with someone who is going through immense change. This is a story of a girl who simply exists, no character change needed.

In my opinion, it's a movie, a work of fiction and not a representation of the actual illness as it affects real people.

Saying that, people are very much influenced by movies, whether they are true or not they still absorb what they see on screen and it can change their views for good or for bad.

Someone further down equated it to a mafia/gangster movie, which I don't think is really fair. The vast majority of people didn't watch the Godfather and say ""those damn Italians, I don't want to associate with them"". Whereas with this movie I can see people coming out thinking ""Is this really what people with Multiple Personality/bipolar/schizophrenia believe?""

I don't think the movie should be boycotted or banned or whatnot. I just don't believe it's a good message and using a serious mental issue, with heavy social stigma, in a negative way for entertainment purposes.

In my opinion it's akin to making a movie about a transsexual person who goes around murdering people and stealing their genitals or a homosexual man who assaults and infects people with HIV.

The audience members who have secretly been rooting for the girls to lose their clothes should hopefully get a ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"" jolt with that final reveal. ",5p1gqe

dcryzaz,"I felt the script made it very obvious why Dr Fletcher was willing to overlook the dangers McAvoy posed to society: she had dedicated her life to researching and understanding people with Multiple Personality Disorder (""My patients are my family""), and so she was willing to take greater risks in pursuit of her research. 

One bit I especially liked was how dressed up she got for her Skype presentation to the psychology conference. Even though her research was a joke to her colleagues, to Dr Fletcher, it was the culmination of a life's work; she *needed* McAvoy to be ""extraordinary."" Losing him to a mental institution would be like losing her own son. ",5p1gqe

dcw2cyz,"I absolutely agree. Maybe other Shyamalan fans liked it for the ""twist""(which I didn't get until I looked it up afterwards) but the movie as a whole continued to disappoint me. There wasn't a clean or satisfying resolution; people can say all they want that this was meant as a sequel to Unbreakable, but the fact is that it was advertised as a separate movie and I'm even more disappointed in Shyamalan for this. I doubt I will ever watch one of his movies again.

And also I could not agree more with you about McAvoy playing caricatures. The one that stood out the most in this aspect was the 9 year old kid; kids that age absolutely do not talk like that, and I feel I've been around them enough to understand. He was obviously meant as out-of-place comedy relief but failed miserably in that aspect.

1. Incidents like this are so rare most people would actually react the same way. You assume people are innocent until its too late. That's why the dad was smiling as Kevin was walking up to him. as for the second point, the main girl even explains later that he'd easily over power her and fighting back is useless. Why do you think she'd be able to beat him up while in the car when he's armed with spray. She tried to leave quietly, that's the best she could have done. (Side note, if you're not satisfied with the spray, note that Kevin works at a Zoo and deals with Bears and Tigers. He may very well have access to tranquilizing chemicals.)


2. Well...It didn't really work out for Claire, did it?


3. She's a headstrong academic who believes her patients are victims in a cruel world. Characters actions don't need to be completely rational as people in reality aren't always completely rational. Hind sight is 20/20 sure but it doesn't make for bad writing or plot holes.


4. Which are you talking about? The Kevin Walter Crumb thing? Yeah that was dumb. 


5. I found them decently well rounded. And besides, personalities don't all need to be super duper different, especially with 23 unique ones. I bet this reflects actual D.I.D. in real life. Also, this isn't a plot hole. I thought the performance for Barry was well done. I think he was supposed to be gay, but they didn't make a big deal or point of it, just subtly implied it (other than the look haha fashion designer thing.) But what I find great about the performance is that there was quite a big difference between his performance as Dennis PERFORMING as Barry, vs. how Barry actually acted in the video. It showed what Dennis THOUGHT of how Barry acted, vs how he really was. When fake Barry was being performed it was far more flamboyant and stereotypical. M Night put a decent amount of thought into this.


I think there is an actually big plot hole though, they established the main chick as very smart and prepared, but she didn't think to just kill Kevin when he was the 9 year old? He had the keys on him, and he could clearly be over powered. I think it should have happened.",5p1gqe

MNS is the twist guy. Everyone knows that by now. Robot chicken has a whole bit about it.

You say it served no purpose, but I say the purpose was to fool the people who were trying to keep a step ahead of him, and it looks like it worked.

Personally, I don't think she was framed separately as a red herring, but as a metaphor for her actual separation from the rest of humanity through her trauma. When the blonde asks, ""why do you pretend like you're not one of us,"" it's very telling... because she isn't, in this universe. The broken are somehow MORE than human in this universe, and this separation is shown in various ways, often through the cinematography. ",5p1gqe

Anyway, the personality that ""liked girls dancing"" (Dennis, I believe) was supposed to be banned from the light. It wasn't until late in the film that she even realized that Dennis had even gotten back into the light. So it seems that she was able to help Kevin for a long time. Really, he seemed to have done great right up till Hedwig started stealing the light for Dennis and Patricia.

I'm not sure if the suicidal personality was always suicidal or if he was like that because he saw that he killed the therapist. And even if he was always suicidal, it still seems like Barry was doing a great job of keeping the personalities in check and safe until Hedwig fucked everything up. Surely Kevin didn't need to be locked up if he's being kept in check?

And while I agree with the OP that it's frustrating that the therapist got herself killed, it's very understandable that she had to be sure that Kevin had gone bad. She viewed her patients like her family, so she's not going to ruin her relationship with Kevin's personalities lightly. Presumably she also hoped that she could save Kevin herself.",5p1gqe

What was brilliant about Unbreakable was that it's a superhero origin story. Sound familiar? Wrong again. Super hero movies are NEVER origin movies. They spend like half the movie showing the superhero emerge and then the last half of the movie is the superhero using his new found powers to do something big. 

Unbreakable was amazing because it literally ONLY focused on a superhero coming to learn he was a super hero. And didn't have a cheap villain fight at the end. While Unbreakable was a superhero origin story, Split is a villain origin story. Think about it. The Beast is emerging the entire time and only becomes the villain at the very end.

dhkh79w,"My experience was that when this was released I only knew it was an M.Knight movie.  I had actually skipped ""Devil"" and only saw the first part of ""Visit"".  I only saw a few teaser trailers and for some reason I decided that I would probably just rent this one. While the movie was playing in theaters, I did not ever hear about any connection to Unbreakable 2 and did not hear anything about a major twist ending.  Based on my personal experiences with word-of-mouth, I decided to skip this movie in theaters.  Fast forward to last week, when I was browsing Reddit and saw a post regarding Split and Unbreakable 2.  Lets clarify one thing: Unbreakable is my favorite M.Knight movie.  When this was in theaters I remember seeing it on Thanksgiving weekend in 2000.  During the movie my heart would pound away at the intense scenes...I absolutely loved the camera work/style and that made it all the more enjoyable for me.  Anyways, after reading on Reddit about the connection, I did not even mind that it was ""spoiled"" for me, I was ecstatic to hear about this connection so I ran out and rented the dvd and watched it last night.  Boy oh boy was it a treat. Spoiler or not, if you are a true fan of the first Unbreakable, nothing can ruin the fun/enjoyment you will get watching Split.  Loved it, and I'm actually GLAD that the link between the two movies was posted because if it wasn't posted, I don't think I would have ever seen this movie until much later.

dhvc9z7,"Explain it like this:

Without knowing the SPOILER (twist, if he prefers), you are watching the movie under the assumption it's in the real world as WE understand it. There are certain rules, physics and physical limitations.

Knowing it is a sequel to Unbreakable offers unlimited possibilities, so when metal knife breaks on skin, or a guy scales a sheer wall, you think ""well, yeah, this isn't the *real world*"".

It removes what should have been a shocking moment, and turns it into just a moment of proof, rather than shock.

dcr84ks,">I'm curious, which movies are the dumpster fires? 

I'd say The Last Airbender is absolutely a horrible film. Dev Patel seemed to be trying hard, but the rest was just really wooden and a mess all around. The Happening is bad, but there's that tiny bit of potential that makes it at least the slightest bit tolerable (even if it's through seeing it as a unintentionally funny B-movie type). After Earth is to Shyamalan as Alien 3 is to Fincher: although we have to, I really don't like classify it as his work. Will Smith seemed to have a lot of creative control in that story, and it feels more like his product than Shyamalan's in some ways. Regardless, I don't even think it's a horrible movie, just a bland one. Lady in the Water is similarly cold and flat, but like The Happening, it's admirable in what it's trying to be, and it's hard to hate because of that. The rest of his movies all range from good to amazing for me.

>And do you really think he will ever outgrow this immense dislike many people have towards him?

I really hope so. There's plenty of people who are slowly coming back around now that he seems to be back in a groove. I think there's always going to be a vocal group that will dislike him forever, but I think the way Shyamalan plays his cards in the future is really going to be a huge part of whether he can really get that interest back. I think he absolutely has to stay in the low-budget game to do that: he really started to fall apart as the budgets grew on his projects.",5p1gqe

dcyhqsw,">I was waiting for some deep moment of growth from the protagonist, where she finally confronts ""the beast"" (her uncle).  Perhaps the entire movie playing out in her own head with her own identities dealing with her trauma. Instead, we get... a reference to Unbreakable? Bleh.

Well first off, it being inside her head makes no sense at all, unless the movie was completely rewritten.  Her 'friends' interact with both her and McAvoy at the same time, and aren't clever enough to try to manipulate Casey (like Casey had attempted with Hedwig), had she been an alter-ego of McAvoy.

Second, we see growth from Casey, because she actually shot the Beast instead of giving up, like the gun to her uncle.  The scene at the end with the cop car is supposed to be ambiguous, because, while we know Casey has grown, we don't know her next step; will she become a villain (or even a multiple-personality herself) with her newfound inner strength?

And calling it just a reference to Unbreakable is selling it short, it gives context to the entire story and shows the beast being supernatural as being consistent with the established universe, and not a fiction in her head",5p1gqe

I completely agree with your notion of the slapstick dialogue of his characters. Like that scene where the neighbor lady says ""I'm definitely going to buy that"". It kind of makes me wince, thinking ""wow this is silly"". It was almost like she was over-acting. However it could tie in with the idea that all of his characters have special quirks. Or it could also be that he's wanting to appease his less intelligent crowd. It could also be that he doesn't want to lend too much energy or attention to another deep character.

The idea was that in any regular house the water wouldn't be there to save them.  But faith intervened. The title was a reference to Signs of a destiny/higher power, not crop circles.   Also Casey's entire character was based upon the fact that she given hope for escape. Which is why she didn't wanna help her friends attack Kevin. And why she didn't even try and leave her cage in the end. The silence to the cop was her still scared to leave her uncle. Remember how she never shot him as a kid.",5p1gqe

Unbreakable spoiler: [Unbreakable followed a similar premise in that the plot didn't really reveal that that it was a superhero film until the end. You weren't sure what you were watching which is what made it so great. This was also before Xmen (released the same year), Iron Man, Avengers, etc. were released so seeing a gritty film that setup a character as being real was pretty awesome. Alas, the film didn't do well at the boxoffice and after 15 years fans began to lose hope of a sequel (I know I did).  That's why the reveal at the end was so great. It just came out of nowhere and changed the entire context of the film.

dcwgzs8,"The more I think about this line of reasoning, the more I am convinced we won't see Casey anymore.   

I think Casey's arc was to finally realize that she does have the courage to stand up to her uncle and end the cycle of abuse.   

Everything she tells the girls at the first about not making him mad and just seeing what he wants from them, etc. (no pun intended) screams ""victim"". We see throughout the flashbacks that she has endured years of abuse by her uncle.

We also see that she was in the right situation to stop the abuse from before, but she froze and couldn't pull the trigger. Now, confronted by the beast, she pulled the trigger not once, but twice!   

And while it was ineffective against him, it showed her she did have an inner strength after all. That is why she didn't move when the police woman told her that her uncle was there to pick her up. he realized she was strong enough after all to stand up to him and end things.   


That being said, at the end we realize this was not Casey's story but Kevin's. Rather than being a story about surviving a kidnapping and coming out stronger instead of broken (a theme in this movie) it is an origin story for a supervillain.   

So I don't think we will see Casey again, except perhaps a blurb in the tv or newspaper about her uncle going to jail for what he did.",5p1gqe

The movie also emphasizes that trauma, abuse, and 'brokenness' open the door to supernatural power, even as they damage and scar the personality.

[infographic](http://geekartgallery.blogspot.com/2013/08/infographic-comics-costume-colors.html). Green is def Dunn's color but it's not a significant superhero color--think Green Goblin, Loki, Poison Ivy, Riddler, Joker. There are exceptions, but they're generally intentional--the Hulk wears green and purple, but he's not a straightforward hero; he's the personification of rage, the Hyde to Banner's Jeckyll.

But they do help us survive.   I hope others saw this theme in the movie too.    I noticed on IMDB that there were a lot of idiots who decided to be upset that people with mental illness were misrepresented.   In fact,   I felt that people with mental issues were shown to simply be different,  misunderstood,   and worthy of redemption and love.   Also of course far more interesting.   I especially liked the perspective of the psychiatrist that in a way,   having DID is what we think of as a power or supernatural or superhuman,   symbolically --   in other words she sees it as a strength developed to deal with unbearable pain.   As opposed to a negative or a disability,   she sees it as something that one must work with,   and find ways to adjust to the outside world,   but not to be judged as a weakness.",5p1gqe

The girls are all in one room  at first, discussing joining together to fight. After expressing doubts, they separately make attempts, then are locked away separately(compartmentalized). Casey gets stronger and more resolute after each of the other girls, and doctor, die. I thought the deaths actually meant that the girls and doctor had integrated into one personality, which is Casey, who can better fight the other remaining personalities. Since they kept showing Casey's background to be one that is common in dissociative disorder, the shotgun in her memories and present, I thought it was going to end up that all the personalities were in Casey. It did mention that Casey ran away a lot, and after she was found in the cell, I thought that maybe the Zoo is where she usually takes sanctuary, and just the long hallway is not real. it did look a bit different when she was discovered, I don't think the bars were still bent, plus the guy who found her, seemed to know her.

Personally, I think Casey told the officer about her uncle at the end.

Dunn's story brings hope to the city, and he gets to return to a loving family. Casey's story brings fear and depression to the city, and she gets to return to a monster for family. Opposites set to face each other in the next movie.

And the best part, unlike a Marvel (and maybe D.C. as well given time) I don't know the outcome and the actions have weight. Dunn could get killed by Horde or Horde by Dunn. Not to say I'm throwing shade at Marvel, but they're safe and predictable.",5p1gqe

I guess ultimately what I'm realizing about the way Shyamalan ended her story... Was that he needed to callback that forest scene perhaps somehow, right? I really wanted that ending to work for me and I will definitely see the film again and give it another shot but... It felt like there was a piece missing there.",5p1gqe

If that's the case, then you're suggesting that Kevin is one of the high school girls too? Why did we have to get a POV shot from the high school girl's perspective when Casey tells her to piss herself... I don't buy any of that personally. The cop speaking to Casey directly in the police car, if nothing else, is definitive proof she was an individual and not one of Kevin's personalities. Nothing about the way that film unfolded suggested to the audience that Casey wasn't a real person... ",5p1gqe
dfqx27a,"I enjoy this perspective but prefer to see it as the observation that the Beast made,   in choosing to associate WITH the side of Casey at the end -- that all hurt people are united in understanding suffering better   (hence the best therapists and friends are people who have had similar experiences.)   NOT that they are in fact one and the same,    but simply that they are the wiser for their similar traumas.    One has scars on the outside,   the other has them on the inside,    or a ""split.""    ",5p1gqe
dfxthss,"I love this perspective but allow me to be a bit more reductive (while elaborating a bit).

The Beast walking away from Casey at the end due to her scars was evidence of her being an empath (as you said, her scars match the wounds of her friends and are not self inflicted), and affirms the concept that Unbreakable and Split are based in -- the power of thought can, and does, change our reality.

Casey is a tuning fork for human experience and emotion, and she quickly understands the complexity of the situation. She figures out which personality is the weakest and latches onto it for help. Kevin (and Mr. Glass) somehow figured out how to harness the power of thought to alter reality and, consequently, their physiology. 

The Beast suggests Casey has evolved to a superior human by being troubled and a victim of abuse, as Kevin was (likely by his father, for whom he left flowers at the train station). Kevin/The Beast equate being victimized with evolution, which Dennis credits as the reason for his existence. Casey evolved when she finally confronted her past (and present), learned to embraced her wounds, and eventually told her story (based on the look she gives the cop at the end).

TL;DR The Beast was the epitomization of the ability of the power of thought to change our reality. SPLIT was a dramatic allegory that we GROW stronger from our experiences, and we can overcome any challenge (including the invincible ""superhero"" introduced in Unbreakable).",5p1gqe
dfevj6l,"I know what you're saying is ultimately what Shymalan's intention was with that scene in the back of the police cruiser... I just don't think he earned it. Or it certainly didn't feel like enough to me. 

What if instead of ending inside the police car, we see her aged uncle and when he tells her to get into the car, she says nothing, stops and looks back at the cop? Then cut out of that... I'd buy that maybe. I feel like maybe SEEING her uncle one last time in the present day might've made it all more powerful if she was literally having to face him again and make a choice... 

And instead of obviously shooting him with a shotgun, she metaphorically does pull the trigger and turns to the cop... Maybe leaving the audience wondering what choice she made this time... Maybe that would've been more effective. I don't know, I hear you but I still don't feel Shymalan hit it home for me... Still kinda feels like he short-handed her story arc to set up an Unbreakable universe... ",5p1gqe

dctshzl,"I was actually thinking of that too. I heard Kevin was originally supposed to be a bigger villain in Unbreakable, Glass being like an intro level boss. And that Kevin himself was working with Glass to bring about the superpersona of David. What brings another element to mind is the whole train incident, because if it's the one that took Kevin's parents it changes the dynamic of the two.
For a little, if you see it from the perspective of Casey, the theme goes back to that line her dad told her, ""It's all about outsmarting this animal"". Again, it's just another layer of stuff to analyze about the movie, who's perspective you want to see it from and how it changes the story a little more each time you find something. And with the information that it's part of the Unbreakable universe, it opens up so many possibilities. ",5p1gqe

dcq19l0,"Little geniuses:

1) The coat hanger scene. Come on. No one could ever bend the coat hanger that perfectly and blindly hit the lock. Chances are they didn't even see what kind of locks were on the doors. And the fact is wasn't pushed and locked down was far too convenient. 

Incongruences:

1) There's 3 of them. And they're chatting with a 9 year old. The plan is to beg Hedwig to let them out?! Casey literally had him halfway into the room so she could whisper in his ear. The other two could have easily ambushed him then, stolen the keys, and locked him in the room. 

2) When they do find the vent, she keeps making noise and pulling on the dry wall while they hold the door closed?! Their best option would have been to stop and hope he doesn't enter the room, so they could have snuck out the vent in silence. 

Also, even though he ""screwed"" that block over the vent, they could have kept working on it to pull it off after the fact, especially when he was out. Even if they didn't go out the vent the second time, they could have used the block and the screws for weapons. This is life or death. Tell me you would just sit on the bed all emo or would you do anything it took to escape?

3) A psychologist. Who works with potentially dangerous DID patients. Knows where Kevin lives. Knows one of his darker personalities has taken over. And goes to his home at night? Without forewarning anyone? Not the authorities?Not a friend? No one. I've worked as a Social Worker, if you're going to see a potentially volatile client, you at the very least let someone know what time you'll be there, the address, and contact them when you leave. No one in the profession for that long with her education lacks that kind of judgement. 

There's more, but that should be enough to nibble on for now.

dcyw7ka,"Re-Unbreakable & Split.  Unbreakable is a non super-hero-super-hero flick.  It's not spandex and heroics, it's an ordinary man who suddenely discovers these powers he has and how to test/use them.  It's an origin story, but not flashy like a marvel flick, more grounded.

the ending of Split makes it apparent that your not watching a horror flick per-se, but another origin flick for a super villian.

i'm guessing these two movies, fleshing out these two 'supers' will lead to a third where they clash and now it's more involved because you know so much about each of them.  I, for one, cant wait.",5p1gqe
dcqqfwv,"Yeah, as a standalone, which it is (its not a sequel, but an anthology of the cloverfield series thus far) its by FAR, a better film. I think the only thing I will say about SPLIT is the entire ""it takes place in so and so previous movie's universe"" gives it a more surprising ending ONLY if you watched unbreakable. With the ending though, I still think 10Cloverfield lane was the better movie.

What I think GlazedReddit was saying about ""what 10 Cloverfield Lane could have been"" though is not about how good the film is, but how it ties everything from a previous movie together. For example, we learn 10Cloverfield lane isnt part of the 1st cloverfield universe, if I am correct, all he is saying is 10 cloverfiled lane had an opportunity to tie it to the first movie as what split did to unbreakable.

It's like trying to end the movie Seven with Brad Pitt becoming the Punisher and violently taking out legions of corrupt cops and organized crime all by himself.

It usually serves him well, but I didn't like it here, for reasons I expand on a little in another comment.

I laughed throughout, as did most in my theater. It's not a comedy, but definitely blends horror and comedy moods.

The sex-crazed werewolf comment was an overly-extreme way to say it's touchy on portraying mental illness, but in parentheses I mostly forgive that as part of its campy vibe.",5p1gqe
dcqg1ir,"Appreciate the response, because it's helping me process through my reaction. Usually I'm the one pushing darker books/art for students I know have been through trauma so they can themselves in these characters.

I guess one issue is that the trauma is a ""twist"". You may seek out art that reflects your struggle, but viewers don't know that going in. I'd be much more comfortable if this was revealed early in the movie and lightly hinted at in the trailer. ""Popcorn movie"" was the wrong term, but I do stand by mainstream-PG-13 horror as a genre meant to bring in large crowds of especially young people. I see a version of this where Taylor-Joy's backstory is an established part of the premise of the movie. I think this could've led to a better-crafted story with sufficient trigger-warning (think ""Don't Breathe"" -- I didn't like it much, but you mostly know what you're getting going in). I don't think slow-revealing this served the movie in any meaningful way, especially when I thought most of the first half was really lacking in the girls' character development.

The comedy did mostly work for me, so I'll walk some of that back, but I think it would come across much better if Taylor-Joy had a fuller role. She spent most of the movie looking numb (clever, yes, but really not emoting, compared to her great job in The Witch), and while she didn't need a happy ending, I think she needed *something* to get back at McAvoy more than she did. Let him go free, let her go back to her uncle, but the victim who has always been a victim powerlessly shooting McAvoy before getting sent back to being sexually abused some more clashed with the mostly light tone of the movie, I thought. Or, was stopping her arc short to save for the sequel.

EDIT: I think your edit is really mischaracterizing my thoughts toward this movie. I'm not trying to define appropriateness or deny complicated, subversive roles to my students. I said the movie rubbed me the wrong way. Some of that is intentional by M. Night. Some students will want to talk about it on Monday (the Arts & Entertainment writers in Journalism class, anyway) and I'll ask questions and try to get them to deepen their thinking on a couple points, but I really don't aim to moralize.",5p1gqe

If the abuse started when he was six and lasted for seven years he would've had to be 13 when he started working at the zoo. Illegal and unlikely.

Much to my chagrin, it wasn't. 


This was an interesting premise and McAvoy did a great job but the plot seemed so incredibly unfocused. A lot of different directions they could've gone with it and they end it with the [bizarre birth of a superhero?

A premise that's pretty much torn from Red Dragon and stupefied to fit Shyamalan's sudden need for mythos-making? 

And I didn't even really go crazy for McAvoy's performance. It was fine, but it wasn't a goddamn piece of mastercraft acting. It was him playing up a few distinct stock characters (Lisping doofus! Gay fashion designer! Bond villain! Werewolf or whatever!) and mildly changing his body language mid-scene. Thomasin from the VVitch was pretty forgettable and muted for most of the movie, until the last twenty minutes when she turned into a run-of-the-mill final girl.

So it leaves me walking out of this movie with a question. Not me thinking about how good the movie was. Roughly an hour after I finished watching Split my whole opinion switched because I ignored the stupid Willis ending and just looked at the movie as its whole and just loved it. Mcovoy's performance is fucking outstanding. Like I loved it. 

If I could turn back time when this movie was coming out and all the reviews were coming out, I would make it so no one talks about the ending and no one hypes it up as much as people did, because I'm sitting here waiting for the end and then the soft ending happens (Mcovoy in the mirror) and I'm like awesome, but it was not as amazing people made it to be and that was a real bummer.

I mean, it's impossible for her to know. No matter how smart she is, she doesn't have any indication of his full strength apart from as Dennis. When he's *really* strong. Only we know about the extent of his bodily changes - he might be a 9-year old but from her perspective, he's still a fully grown man. The one thing she does know is that he's not as intelligent as an adult so she's trying to outsmart him.

The ONLY bit that really bugged me was when the two girls were locked in rooms lined with shelves lined with boxes and objects, and only decide to look for something to help them escape after many hours/days.

Even the most ill-prepared person in the world would have looked inside a box or two at SOME POINT, for a weapon or communication or something to pass the time or anything. They might be too scared to do anything with it but they'd know the room.

It's classic bad movie logic: we haven't checked in on a character for a while, so while they're off screen they're basically in status until we come back to them. Like seeing two people hop into a car and one says ""I'll explain on the way!"" then we cut to them arriving at the destination and the character is only just explaining the situation. You didn't explain during the 10 minute drive? Or when a character walks into a room and the person they're there to see is just standing there, staring off into space, until the scene begins. What were they doing? How long were they standing still doing nothing for? Happens in Game of Thrones a lot. ",5p1gqe
dct2wp3,"And when he finally gets through and realizes where the one girl went, he just leaves the two girls there and they stay in the room like morons.

Oh and here's another plot hole. When the monk personality gets hit by a chair and keels over. The girl just runs away instead of continuing to hit him with the chair. She had a perfect opportunity to beat him to death right there. Fuck this movie.",5p1gqe

ddn9nnd,"I think this is more indicative of a lot of folks still being uncomfortable with real life tragedies which hit close to home, finding their way into movies. Many Americans go to the movies for escapism from the ""suck"" of life, and that behavior tends to reinforce the movies being a ""safe space"" to some degree, insulated from the disturbing problems on the real world. I think you're right in that the OP probably falls on this category and / or hasn't seen to many many films or books. I also think it may be natural for someone a bit naive as to the nuances of character development in film or literature, to mistake some of the troubling elements of this film as a subtle PSA of some sort. But honestly isn't that *every* movie or book, or most entertainment mediums, depicting these kinds of societal of psychological issues, a subtle or overt PSA as to the existence of these issues, making use of mass media to raise awareness or advance a cause? The entire movie was based on the fact that Kevin and Casey were similar if not the same, in that they were abused as children. As the Beast, he even says it towards the end. That suffering in the manner they had, purifies the soul. While I doubt M. Night Shyamalan actually meant to pass this specific message to audiences, no doubt he wanted to touch on and empasize a deeper cultural message about those facing abuse. That they don't have to be victims.

dcwfhbo,Also Kevin's dad more than likely died on the train crash that Bruce Willis' character was the sole survivor of. Kevin was placing flowers at the train station. ,5p1gqe
dcxh4u8,">  This means that Kevin doesn't just have DID - he has (or the Beast has) legitimate super powers. 

That's not necessarily true despite 'super powers'. Kevin had have DID, he was severely abused by his mother and those personalities manifested as a coping mechanism. The point is that under extreme trauma and DID being the result, certain superhuman attributes are possible. Remember, on a much less impressive level it's like people who can do unusual feats under stress or with deep focus (controlling body temp, heart rate, google Wim Hof)... 

So in this universe, people with DID like Kevin believe so much that their personalities are real that their physiology actually changes to match. Like one of them needed insulin shot for diabetes yet the rest didn't. The beast is super fast, strong, climb walls and can with stand bullets to a degree. The DID allowed Kevin to access the parts of his mind/brain that are 'unknown' as his therapist stated, theorizing how people with DID can have such distinct alters. 

And remember, in M. Night's unbreakable Mr. Glass talks about comic book super powers as exaggerations of the real life abilities. The beast didn't actually grow that much taller (if at all) or more muscular or hairy... but on a real biological level, something did change to make it so powerful. Legit unnatural and 'super' but still grounded in some semblance of reality. ",5p1gqe

It was explained that tapping into this 24th personality would unlock parts of the brain that were not normally accessed in humans. The psychologist even compared it briefly to the worlds most talented rock climbers, holding on to the smallest of slick holds and scaling walls with ease. The shots to the chest which didn't kill him were also a bit outrageous, but on that same theme of explanation by the psychologist, it was explained that one personality might be allergic to bees while the others are not, or that one has diabetes while the others don't, etc. So this beast was so ""evolved"" in brain function that trying to kill it specifically did not effect the other personalities (or Kevin's body) for that matter.

He apparently financed Split. He can use the net-new money he is currently getting for Unbreakable and shoulder any reservations a studio may have over an Unbreakable sequel (although I think he is building up cachet with the studios and that won't be a problem).

Folks hoping for a ""David Dunn vs. the Beast"" movie are forgetting that ""Unbreakable"" wasn't about Dunn using his powers to fight bad guys for two hours so much as it was his journey of self-discovery and the impact it had on his relationship with his wife and son. The film's best moments aren't action/fight scenes (though the scene where he gets on the back of the Man in Orange and *just doesn't let go no matter* what is pretty great) but rather, the more quiet and intimate moments (e.g. telling his wife that he had a bad dream --- a symbol that their marriage has been restored, him and his son screwing around with the barbell, the gun/kitchen scene, the quiet moment at the end where he lets his son know that he was the guy being written about in the newspaper and his son's eyes welling up with tears).

There's not even a ""villain"" until the final 20 minutes when we get the Man in Orange. And then the Mr. Glass reveal is the final scene.

I'm not saying that the Dunn character couldn't be explored further in some meaningful way (though I feel like if MNS had a really great idea, he would have done it by now), but I just don't feel like a ""versus"" film is the appropriate way to do it.",5p1gqe

I'll also point out a few factual errors in your analysis.

 > And didn't have a cheap villain fight at the end.

Actually, ""Unbreakable"" *does* feature a villain fight at the end. David fights the Orange Suit Man in one of the film's final scenes. You've probably overlooked it because Orange Suit Man is introduced relatively late in the film, and MNS didn't spend an hour building up to the confrontation in typically overt fashion. And also because the final reveal with Mr. Glass tends to take away most of the attention from this other conflict.

You've also glossed over an important detail in your overzealous comparison of ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split."" Whereas David undergoes a journey of self-discovery, Kevin's personalities aren't really learning anything about themselves. All are keenly aware of the Beast's existence, to the extent that one of the personalities describes him in vivid detail. They know what he looks like, what his powers are, etc... It is less self-discovery than simply waiting for him to emerge. This isn't even necessarily an ""origin story"" as I don't believe it is ever definitively said whether the Beast has emerged in the past.

Certainly, digging **deep enough** into two pieces of fiction will reveal thematic similarities to one another. But the lines you've attempted to draw between David and Kevin/The Beast are tenuous at best. Frankly, there are stronger comparisons here between David and Casey.

My point was and is that—without any other meaningful evidence (of which there is none)—the ""Split"" stinger (or pseudo stinger) shouldn't be accepted as anything other than a fun, very brief acknowledgement that this film and ""Unbreakable"" take place in the same universe. If MNS should come out at some point and say otherwise, then great. But I believe people are sort of deluding themselves into thinking that the David Dunn scene represents more than it actually is (much as people were absolutely **certain** that the big ""twist"" in this film was going to be that Claire and Marcia were alternate personalities of Casey).",5p1gqe
dcp239e,"Because M. Night always imagined it as a series of film. Unbreakable was meant to be the origin that normal makes for the first 30 minutes of a superhero film. The following films would see David actually trying to be a hero and the last would be the big showdown with the major villain. With Split we basically have the origin for the major villain. Like Mr. Glass, Kevin Crumb is a dark reflection of David Dunn. He discovers his invincibility from psychological trauma rather than physical trauma like David. He even hates what David is, a person that can't be hurt or experience pain. It's really well set up for them to be mortal enemies.",5p1gqe

In the film, Dennis reminded Dr. Fletcher about a German woman she wrote about, who also had DID. The woman, who had been blind for 10 years, was able to see when she took on her other personalities. Well, that's based on an actual woman in Germany who suffers from DID: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3333615/The-blind-woman-suddenly-37-year-old-multiple-personalities-finds-vision-changes-depending-character-is.html

Obviously, Night took creative license with it, as Dennis reminded the Fletcher of her theory that the woman regenerated her optical nerves because her other personalities believed they could see. So, if the person with DID truly believes, then he/she can accomplish things beyond what one would consider human. Not exactly psychological blindness, since in the actual German woman, they found no visible damage. But, I thought it was awesome that he based the explanation of The Horde on an actual case.

Obviously, the film becomes a bit supernatural, but the fact that it was revealed to be in the same universe as Unbreakable, a realistic super hero who cannot hurt and can sense evil acts with a touch, makes the stretch rest easy in my mind. As you can tell, I loved it",5p1gqe

""I just got home from seeing the movie and I had the exact same theory about her having a split personality as well.

However, I'm not sure if this is the case. Based on the rules of this universe the heroes and villains must be opposite. She was level headed through this entire experience, with the exception of the part where she was crying in the bedroom. I equate this moment in a way to David Dunn and the pool (I just saw it and have to watch it again but the idea is ""pick yourself up and try again"").

The point I am trying to make is that I think she is his opposite. She is collected where he is unhinged. She solves problems herself where as he has created the personalities to help him. She is whole where he is broken (split. eh? eh???).

The part with the cop was to symbolize that she understands what she is capable of. When she stares at the cop it is implied that there is an understanding. She is going to speak up this time. Thus ending this lifelong struggle of being a victim and completing her arc.""

dd3hy05,"It is a great film. If you'd like to read my other comments throughout this thread you'd see I actually came around to loving this film by itself.

Then once I finished the movie and I see Willis all I could think of sooo this is before he gets shot and dies and shows up in the Sixth Sense? 


I've never seen Unbreakable because, when it came out, I was 13. At that time the movie probably didn't interest me at all.

dcynnf8,">Well first off, it being inside her head makes no sense at all, unless the movie was completely rewritten. Her 'friends' interact with both her and McAvoy at the same time, and aren't clever enough to try to manipulate Casey (like Casey had attempted with Hedwig), had she been an alter-ego of McAvoy.

I mean, yeah you would have to rewrite a little bit, but I think it could have worked.  Had she been the primary personality (like Kevin) the room could have represented her own isolation and the girls and Mackavoy interacting with her wouldn't have been literal, but rather manifestations of her other personalities acting within her mind.  I think that was more what deRoyLight was talking about here.

However that definitely would have been a worse ending.  As much as I didn't like the ending, I was basically pleading that the twist wasn't going to be that she also had DID or was a part of Kevin or vice versa.  That would have been way too obvious and ruined the whole thing.  ",5p1gqe

Big comic conventions were pretty small in comparison to today.  You couldn't walk into a mall and get a Captain America shirt in every store.  And here you were watching the hottest filmmaker of the day trick people into watching a comic book movie that both honoured comic books and elevated them to art.  It was far more subtle and refined than any comic book films up to that point (and probably every thing since).

dcqw6r5,"Hedwig has the power to put any one into the light - give them control over Kevin's body. Normally, only Barry can control that and specifically kept both Dennis and Patricia in the dark because they were bad. It's implied that Patricia is a continuation of Kevin's abusive mother while Dennis is a personality designed to give Kevin somewhere to go durring a bad situation. This state may have been brought about when Kevin at work was accosted by two teenage girls and they had him out his hands on their breasts, but that's only implied.

With that in mind, Patricia (who seems to be calling the shots) either got to Dennis and tricked him into believing Kevin was to weak and couldn't handle living in this world. She continued to trick Dennis by telling him about the Beast and how through the Beast they would be able to always be strong and never made fun of again. With that, Dennis was hooked. As a side note, the Beast is a personality that was born out of the despair and loneliness Kevin felt when his father left on a train, or more likely died in a train crash (most likely the same one Mr. Glass caused in Unbreakable).

Patricia and Dennis then started spreading rumors about the Beast to all the other personalities. I think there orginal plan was to try and get one of them to join them to ready control from the group. Obviously, this didn't work because none of them fell for it. Que Hedwig's new found ability to control who gets the light.

They than spent their time targeting Hedwig. First they broke him calling him a mistake and saying he couldn't do anything right, etc. Then they followed it up by saying all the other personalities agreed with them. Lastly, they gave him the affection that he craved through the Beast and said if he helps them no one would make fun of him again. It's not clear on what Patricia is getting out of this, so I might be wrong on why exactly she does what she does, but I don't think she cars at all about the well being of Kevin.

If I'm right about Patricia, then she is really the big bag of the film. The Beast is just another personality she's using for whatever her end goal is. But I could be wrong and Patricia could just be a twisted version of a mother as Kevin sees it. She's horrid and abusive, but at the same time has a twisted sense of maternal protection (in the sense that the beast way to protect your kid is to have them kill everyone they don't like).",5p1gqe

dcxtfjx,"No, she's definitely going to be seen again...for several reasons.

1. Her name is Casey Cook...classic super hero name alliteration..like David Dunn. Or Kevin Crumb. 

2. They say in the movie that the people with the supernatural abilities are always ""broken."" Casey is totally broken because of her uncle but it gave her the ""superpower"" to take on Kevin.

This was definitely her origin story too. My best guess is she hooks up with David's now adult son (who I bet is now his ""Robin"").",5p1gqe
dcwkf2g,"I agree that part of this story had to deal with Casey finding her inner strength and to stand up to those who hurt her (mainly her uncle), but I don't think that the end of the film completes her story arc. 

We know that Kevin and Casey are connected because they have both suffered trauma, and I think it's possible to build on that. It'd be interesting to see them on polar opposites of the spectrum; Kevin is broken and BECAUSE he's broken, he's turned into this dark, malicious being. Casey is broken too, but instead of same thing happening to her, she defeats her own fears and becomes stronger because of it. 

I'd like to see her reach out to David or see David reach out to her and they kind of ""team up"" together. Perhaps they could build a father/daughter relationship, and that'd be nice to see, considering everything Casey has been through. 

I just really love Anya Taylor-Joy. She's fantastic. I guess we shall see what's to come! ",5p1gqe

-As to why he didn't automatically spray her and he looked like he was thinking about it: he was tracking the two girls in the backseat for weeks, Casey was never one of the original targets. I don't think he knew what to do with her at first, but thought it through and sprayed when she tried to escape

-As to why she didn't immediately flee the car when she saw him or even after he sprayed her friends: I'm not sure if she was torn between abandoning her friends or not (even though they're not close), or just in a bit of shock. she's also been a victim her whole life since she hasn't confronted her uncle yet, so she might just have thought ""here we go again"". idk  

-As to the three girls' terrible survival instincts throughout the film: I think this just has to do with the fact that they're only high school girls and have never been in a situation like that

-As to why Casey didn't tap into her obvious hunting/survival skills she learned as a child: I think she was probably trying to suppress any and all memory relating to the hunting trips, for obvious reasons ",5p1gqe
dgiemit,The whole point is that she freezes under pressure from her abusers. She has lived nearly her entire life being abused over and over and she has decided she can't win and can't escape.

She knows she can't. ,5p1gqe
dfxdtj8,"That's not in her character though, they addressed that. She's a victim, and throughout the capture she begins to overcome that.

dg3xs3i,"I just finished watching the movie, and up until the final bits I was under the impression that she had already been kidnapped by him, and is afraid of him/aware of his power, and has given in. Saying the car broke down is a pretty obvious excuse to avoid them meeting the person picking her up, which a kidnapper might want. And it would explain why she wasn't surprised/phased when he showed up: she tried to avoid them giving her a ride because she wanted to avoid this happening but once she got in the car with them she knew Dennis would come get her back. 

However, after seeing her uncle come pick her up and the report that Kevin had been stalking the other girls it seems less likely. A few things still make think something like this is going on though. She seems to understand Kevin's nature much more quickly than the other girls- she's knows peeing yourself will stop Dennis, and she immediately grasps the nature of his DID eg. that Hedwig is gullible and that the different identities can be played against each other.

It does make me wonder if there is some secret twist here that I'm missing, like that the Uncle is one of Kevin's personalities, or that Casey has been complicit in Kevin's activities because he doesnt abuse her like her uncle, and that the uncle is afraid to call the Police about her disappearance.

All these guys (the superheros) have some kind of pain, im sure Willis probably has some family or emotional pain that was glossed over. We know Mr. Glass 's story and we now know Kevin's.

When Fletcher said Dennis was made to protect and adapt etc, im thinking M. Nght is saying what yo are saying.

Also to go deeper and make more assumptions. Maybe M.Night was a nerd growing up, maybe he was the one picked one. He turned to stories to help him grow. He used his pain to make movies and probably feels thats the best motivator in life.",5p1gqe

dct2srn,"It's definitely one of the fan theories, but with this being an addition to the Unbreakable universe and based off real life illnesses I don't think DID is the only illness that can create superpowers.

It's just that all that is not realistic at all, and up till the final scene, I was unsure as a viewer whether or not the movie would attempt to ground itself in reality by revealing that The Beast was something entirely in Casey's head. Instead, it went the other way and confirmed that it takes place in a different reality where superpowers are in fact real.  

Maybe some of that skepticism was misplaced, though, and I should have expected a certain level of mystic/supernatural elements going in, given that these are staples of Shyamalan's movies. ",5p1gqe

One thing I kept thinking when he finally became the beast is that his fingers aren't much longer and he doesn't have a hairy mane like Thatcher had said.  So clearly his persona's perceptions of each other/themselves are hyperbolic or represent how they feel about them.

I'm not really counting Elijah because besides his intellect he hasn't really displayed any ""super"" qualities, but yeah. I wish they'd show us a bigger picture of everything but I can see how Shyamalan might just tackle the Barry/David conflict, with both of them having been ""created"" by Elijah Price and such.

Overall, Shyamalan flirts with the line between realism and surrealism. Like Batman's Nolan,  he is human but he can't still break cement with his broken knee. I love this because you suspend your disbelief but not too much.

I find it a little bit unfair of Shyamalan to assume that people will recall _Unbreakable_, hell I watched it when it came out 17 years ago and I didn't even remember it was made by Shyamalan. Let's be honest, it's not the pinnacle of film history you're supposed to be remembering.

The only reason I kinda knew that it's somehow related, is because a friend of mine told me that there's a cameo in the end one day before I saw it. I jokingly said ""Bruce Willis"", because of _Sixth Sense_ (Split was about split-personality, Bruce Willis played a psychologist in _Sixth Sense_ and also it's the main role in Shyamalans best known movie) and my friend hinted that he played in _Unbreakable_ too.

Even then I didn't get it right away. The woman at the bar in the end said something along ""this reminds me of that wheelchair dude"" and I didn't remember the plot for the movie, so I had to reread it on Wikipedia.

_Even then_ I found no parallels between the stories, because I was searching for clues inside the plot. It hit me finally. But not immediately. I think the idea is great, but it was handled bad, especially the final scene, at least for me. This really just looked like the gimmicky Bruce Willis cameo my friend told me about, not like a big reveal.

Its why its not until the end of the movie she decides not to hide anymore and shows the Beast who she is. 

Interesting, Part of me wonders if she revealed her self-inflicted wounds earlier that would have Dennis let her go? It was mentioned that he was following the other 2 girls for 4 days anyway because they'd definitely never been through anything.

Relevant quote:

""[This] character, Kevin from Split, was in the original script of Unbreakable. The original draft of Unbreakable focused on David Dunn and Elijah as his mentor. Elijah tells him, “You’re a comic book character, go try it.” And instead of bumping into the Orange Suit Man, David bumps into one of Kevin’s personalities and goes to save the girls. So you’d have been watching the girls side of it the whole time. That was the outline.""",5p1gqe

I would argue that Unbreakable was more about Dunn, he was most definitely the protagonist, and iirc it is more about Glass trying to get him to see that he can be a hero, and the lengths he's wiling to go to, even making himself the villain, in order to do so.

In reality, it all hinges on how willing Jackson is to reprise his role.",5p1gqe

dcr7rxp,"I figured there would be a twist since it was Shyamalan and almost from the get-go figured Casey was somehow one of Dennis' personalities. At the start in the car he knocks out the two girls and only does so to Casey when she's about to escape aka possibly take control as main personality?

Then when she's on the walkie-talkie asking for help and Dennis regains control she says something about she only has a few hours left, surely if she thought she was about to be killed it'd be there and then, but seems she was referring to the Beast's arrival.

Then some other dialogue for example when he split the girls up he stated 'You won't ever see her again' as if there was only the other girl left in the room. And when we see Dennis finish his Psych sessions it seems to switch to Casey waking up in the dungeon.

Then the end scene of her facing off the Beast with the shotgun after having seen a flashback previously of her facing her uncle with a shotgun but that time not able to pull the trigger.

Of course there tons of evidence to suggest otherwise which makes the idea of her being one of his personalities impossible, but fun to consider!

http://www.whatisepigenetics.com/epigenetics-avoiding-the-pull-of-pseudoscientific-nonsense/

""Some claim that, with the power of your mind, you can epigenetically cure or develop cancer, that positive thoughts can actually relax and lengthen DNA strands, or that happiness sits in reserves on your DNA eagerly waiting to spring to life at the command of your beliefs, emotions, and behavior!""

""But anyway, movies still have the power to shape people's opinions on things like DID even if they are fictional.""

Again, this is not the films fault. It is classifed as fiction, it is not promoting itself as fact - it does not have the obligation to educate people on DID. Moving on...

""For many people who are familiar with the concept of DID, it comes entirely from creepy villains in movies like Split or Psycho.""

My initial point still stands. 

"" I could understand why somebody with actual DID might be frustrated with how it's depicted in movies.""

People can be frustrated if they like. Doesn't mean their frustration is based on any kind of logic.

""Telling them ""well, the people who are believing you're a crazy killer are just dumb"" would not make them feel any better about these depictions""

I really don't give a shit if they ""feel better"" - I'm not in the business of making people happy. I'm about providing facts. If they can handle those facts or not is not my problem. They can continue to cry and stomp there feet, doesn't matter to me.

Casey could have DID eventually since she was molested as a child, but I think it would have pointed to it or made it a little obvious at some point in the movie to make her like Kevin and the fact it happened when she was a child, she could have developed a personality then, I doubt she has DID. I think the reason he spared her and claimed she is 'pure' is obviously because she cuts herself and has some sort of depression or anxiety because she likes to be alone due to her pos uncle. She was way smarter than the other girls and much more calm during all of the altercations they had with Dennis/Patricia/Hedwig, so I wanna guess that's why The Beast believes she's pure. ",5p1gqe

As for the beast thing in general, some may dislike it and see it coming (understandably so) but let's be honest, it was a huge Chekov's Gun. 


I understand where you are coming from in regards to looking ahead in his movies. But I think maybe go see it again, and while knowing all the twists, try looking for the small things in the movie (like the dance scene is a story in itself apparently). You may like the style more after. I plan on seeing it again soon just to find the Easter Eggs. ",5p1gqe
dcs863u,"> He said it was a little like if the movie Alien ended with a Predator arriving and killing the Alien and then leaving Ripley alive (overlooking for a moment that Predator came out several years after Alien.)

The difference is that in this example, the out of nowhere Predator resolves the plot of the movie, and then it ends.  Of course anyone would feel cheated out of an in-story resolution.    In Split, the movie had ended.  The plot was done.   Then there was a tag at the end.  That tag didn't affect the plot of the movie in any way, it was just an easter egg.

""I'm sure you can find much more indepth explanations elsewhere but basically it puts it in the Unbreakable universe that means there are some supernatural-like people on the planet that have super abilities...which in turn means, this movie is basically an origin story for an almost comic book style super villain.""",5p1gqe

The second approach is more in line with lashing out at others - brought to use by Kevin. It's the same way a bully might act the way he does because his father abuses him at home.

One internalizes their abuse while the other externalizes it. It's it brought to an extreme? Yes. But the film doesn't argue or make a point to show that abuse victims are someone to be scared of.

First, while it makes a lot more sense for Dennis, it doesn't exactly fit the tone of a PG-13 movie.  The reason I think it was changed is because when Dennis quickly brings the girl back in after she has urinated on herself,  he is furiously shaking his hand as though he got urine all over it.  Why would he have his hand near her crotch if he just wanted her to dance?  Also, the line right there that the girl says, 'he wanted me to dance for him' is very obviously ADR'ed.

The final scene in Split implies that Willis turned Glass in, so there's a lot of possibility to explore in the aftermath 

The more I've thought about it, Glass could be a Hannibal figure that Willis reluctantly turns to for help with 'The Beast' just as easily as he could be an old mentor that Willis has been visiting in prison for the last 15 years. Either way would be pretty compelling since he's probably the only one who knows Willis' true nature as a ""superhero""...but after rewatching Unbreakable I'd think a big distinction from Hannibal would (probably) be Glass genuinely wanting to help Willis regardless of the circumstances

So if the movie bills itself as psychological thriller vs psychological supernatural thriller, it changes the perception of what is ""fair game"". 

Split seems to start in purely the psychological thriller realm for the majority of the duration (with admittedly subtle hints at more), but then pivots pretty hard to the supernatural. By having the final scene connecting it to Unbreakable, it firmly says ""this is a fantasy"". 

The closest comparison I can make to how this film approaches the supernatural is the Prestige where it's not clear until the end that this is definitely not meant to be the real world.  ",5p1gqe

dd33l4h,MNS has said he has wanted to make an Unbreakable trilogy since before Unbreakable came out.  Unfortunately his legacy soured rather quickly and he never got the chance.  I'd like to see what else he has in mind. ,5p1gqe
dcrzw62,"Not to be petty, but your analysis is ""poorly constructed.""

First, Unbreakable does NOT feature a villain fight.  Every super hero has the period of time while they learn about their powers.  In Spiderman, for example, you seem him beat up some GENERIC baddies who are otherwise not important to the story.  Same with Iron Man.  Same really with any origin story.  This beating up usually takes place near the end of the hero learning their powers.  The orange man is a generic baddie.  He is in no way key to the story, nor a foil to David.  The actual baddie is 100% clearly Mr. Glass, but you'll notice there is NO confrontation between Mr. Glass.  Instead, we see the reveal and the movie ends.  You mistake ""conflict"" and ""generic baddies"" for a villain.  Mr. Glass, the Goblin, the Joker - those are villains.

Second, the Beast absolutely DOES have an origin.  The movie starts with us meeting Kevin and his personalities.  They all talk about the beast, but we don't BELIEVE the beast exists.  He is a myth, a delusion, something that couldn't exist.  In the first hour of the movie, there literally is no beast, nor any belief he is possible.  Everything until that moment is fully grounded in reality and explainable.  Near the end, we finally see a 24th personality reveal itself.  It becomes clear now that the beast is real, and has always been there waiting to come out.  We are TOLD about the beast and his powers, just like we are TOLD that David is a hero.  But we don't see either party's real powers until the last twenty minutes of the movie.  And just like in Unbreakable, the Beast here also did not have a major confrontation.  He got shot allowing the girl to escape, but HE also escaped ... he didn't fight any major power at all.  He wasn't challenged in any major way.

Third, it's a shame you don't see what I think is painfully obvious.  Unbreakable is an origin story about a hero.  Split is an origin story about a villain.  Now begs the question - when and why do they fight.  This is where shit gets REALLY interesting.  Did you notice that Kevin said his father died on a train?  Did you notice that he went and left flowers beside a train track?  Did you notice he FIRST turns into the beast when standing on top of a train?  Do you remember why a train was key to Unbreakable?  I suspect that David AND Kevin's father were on the train wreck that started Unbreakable.  And just as that train wreck gave rise to David, the train wreck also gave rise to Kevin.  Now what I find immensely interesting is the following - while Mr. Glass is a villain, he clearly can't go toe to toe with David.  When we have villains like that (think Lex Luther), you typically have the villain create or enlist ANOTHER villain to do his dirty work.  My guess is that it Mr. Glass and Kevin will meet and that Mr. Glass will be the connecting point between Kevin and David, and that the third movie will be a battle between the two.  What added evidence do I have?  The very last scene literally talks about Kevin and Mr. Glass in that Kevin ""reminded"" the diner patrons of Mr. Glass.

Fourth, did you notice the music at the end was the SAME music played at the end of Unbreakable?  

Fifth, what the fuck are the ""stronger"" comparisons between David and Casey?  Casey exhibits literally no super hero powers or potential, and is smart as a whip from the very beginning.

Sixth, I haven't looked but I""m pretty fucking sure that M. Night talked about the fact that Unbreakable was going to be a totally different movie and that he cut it down a ton.  My guess is that the original Unbreakable was much longer or featured Kevin in some way or was going to.  And this is simply M. Night continuing the story.

Seventh, whoever was ""convinced"" that Claire and Marcia were alternate personalities have nothing to do with me.  I don't even understand why that would be a possibility.",5p1gqe
dcpw37e,"> Because M. Night always imagined it as a series of film. 

Do you have a source for this? This is the first time I'm hearing this. I've read (numerous times) that ""Unbreakable"" was his favorite movie to make and that he always hoped that he could revisit the David Dunn character in some way, shape or form, but suggesting that ""Unbreakable"" was intended to be the first in a series of films feels a tad revisionist.

The brain and body has all of the right chemicals to resolve eyesight, it's just a matter of the mechanisms to do that. But say a DID patient believes they can levitate 50 feet above the ground in thin air. That defies all physics, and for me, breaks out of the ""what **could** the mind do"" benefit of the doubt. Super human strength? Sure, let the body pump a bunch of chemicals, let the body use muscles to the point of destruction. And a DID patient could potentially bend some iron rods. But to levitate 50 feet in the air? That's beyond this scope.  
  
Relative to Unbreakable - somewhat similar. There are people that are great at reading other people. That's how lots of security training happens. Looking for signs, emotions, etc. So they take it a step further in Unbreakable and show him viewing actual scenes ... eh, that's like borderline.

The whole time in the car he never looks at her till she tries opening the door. When he sprays the two girls he goes from looking straight ahead to looking right at them. Also the girl in the front kind of blended into the interior of the car. That's how I understood it.

I'm not sure how she might have found out about Kevin's existence in the first place if they were going to go with such a plot - perhaps through some of the doctor's TED talks.

If you watch Split as a singular movie then you'll either like the unanswered questions it poses, like the one you asked, or you'll hate the movie for that same reason. Either way it won't feel quite whole, and I believe that's fully intended.

dfmipcj,"I can see the distaste for the film having not seen the tie in to unbreakable. My girlfriend who couldn't recall unbreakable felt similarly. She felt the child molestation was tacky and unnecessary till he tied it in at the end and didn't believe it was going in that angle when I called it during the scene the uncle walked by the tent and her dad was sleeping. She mostly felt the film was okay. I didn't find the film to be amazing myself but thought (as another in this thread referred to it) the supervillain ""origin"" story aspect made this entertaining for me. I was never into DC and Marvel superheroes and feel this is a cool twist on things.

As I said though, I can see where most are coming from and I feel having read a lot of negative and positive remarks the most of the ladder understood where he was going because they watched unbreakable.

ddkonwu,"But the self-harm wasn't *her* redemptive quality at all.  The scars implied that she has suffered during her life.  The thought that she has suffered redeemed her (to use your word) in the mind of a clearly very mentally ill man with evil intentions who believed that those who had never suffered were not ""pure"" or good enough.  It was in that very sick man's mind that the scars suggested that she had suffered and thus was more like him than the other people.  It was only redeeming to that one, clearly sick, character.

The character traits that kept her alive most of the film were her ability to persevere and her patience.  From the very beginning, she assessed situations before acting.  That is a good thing in almost all aspects of life.

You're confusing what redeemed her in the eyes of the bad guy with her actual good qualities in the eyes of the viewer.


Edit:  I shouldn't have used the word redeeming.  It's not that he found it redeeming in her.  It's that she did not fit the mold of person he was wanting to hurt.  He wanted to punish those who have never suffered.  This is discussed in the movie.  The self-harming scars suggests to him that she must have suffered at some point to have done that.  He stopped because he had no intention of hurting people who have suffered, and that was imply some evidence that she's suffered at some point.  If he knew for any other reason, he would have let her go as well or never have abducted her in the first place.

Then there's also the ways in which we can compare and contrast the three characters, their perspectives and philosophies. It all fits together rather well. Plus there's the theory that Kevin's father died in the train accident Mr. Glass orchestrated.",5p1gqe

Nothing I mentioned in my original comment would be an issue if they were handled well, but poorly-drawn characters unravels the whole thing for me.

I should've started my original comment with my thoughts on why it didn't work, not as a PC thing. Because it doesn't work, it unravels a movie that also poorly handles its characters. 

I'm being repetitive at this point, but I think if the movie is going to continually flash back to Taylor-Joy's past, from a storytelling perspective that should pay off in the end.

Additionally, the posters for the movie feature a similar style with the broken glass effect. There are other tie-ins about Kevin's father possibly dying in the same train wreck from Unbreakable -- meaning Elijah created both a villain and a hero that day.

I mean, Kevin even asked Casey to kill him, so I'm guessing there's all sorts of personalities inside of him; good, neutral, bad, evil, etc.


As for Casey, I don't see her character being brought back in the follow-up. I mean, everything that happens in this movie is just there for Kevin's ""origin story"", in that aspect I guess Casey isn't really a center character at all, more like a bystander that experienced and witnessed this event, but that's about it.


But that doesn't mean that there's no way for her to be brought back. Maybe David eventually stumbles upon her, and ""touches"" her so he can get some information on the Beast and what it looks like/can do, or something like that.

dgsufpj,"Most of the flashbacks shown are from Casey's perspective (presumably), but there is one flashback that we know is actually Kevin's. It depicts him hiding from his mom under the bed. Why is this lone flashback shown in the first person rather than 3rd person? I think it was to obscure from the viewer who was actually experiencing it. It would have revealed that it was the same child in all of the flashbacks.

Although the Uncle and Dad refer to Casey by name multiple times, it is possible that they are actually saying KC (short for Kevin Crumb).

I believe that Casey can therefore see and feel the experiences (particularly pain) of the people around her. This would explain why she always prefers to be alone. It explains why she Is able to read people so well. She knows how Kevin's persona is thinking and feeling which is why she never really seems to be afraid of him except at the end when he becomes the Beast.

The scars that are revealed on Casey's body at the end are not the scars of abuse, or even self inflicted scars. They are the scars of wounds experienced by people around her. The cuts on her stomach are the cuts the Marsha received from Kevin with the kitchen knife. The other scars on her torso look like shot gun blast (a result of Casey shooting the Beast).

Similar to how Kevin's mind can physically change him into the Beast, Casey's thoughts (the pain and suffering of others) can manifest in her body as well.

There are a few really brief scenes (literally like 2 seconds) in the movie that show Casey writhing in extreme pain. Each of these scenes is immediately followed by one (or all) of Kevin's alter's emailing Dr Fletcher for help.  I think Casey can feel the torment going on in Kevin's head at those times.   

Like Elijah and David Dunn, Kevin and Casey are two sides of the same coin. I know it's kind of out there, but I think it's a possibility given Shyamalan's love of misdirection. And I agree with you that it is ""heavily implied"" that Casey appears to be terrified at the end when the cop says her Uncle is there.....but it was also heavily implied that Bruce Willis was alive in the Sixth Sense.

It was also clearly established that different personalities can have completely different biological characteristics.  It is completely plausible that one of his identities has special characteristics.  

In this Unbreakable world we know superpowers exists.  We also know that very few people in this world are aware of this fact.  Dr. Jenner wouldn't believe in the possibility of him having an identity with powers because to her knowledge, no human is capable of having this power.  We obviously know that it is possible in that world thanks to David Dunn.  Dr. Fletcher was right that they were only scratching the surface and that DID individuals could be ""special"".

Yes, I do, but it goes outside of the context of the film itself (kinda).  See spoiler.

[So as you know, there is a bit of a twist at the end in that we find out it exists in the same universe as Unbreakable.  You may or may not know, that's another M. Night film.  It's basically a superhero origin story.  M. Night has said in interviews that Kevin from Split was actually part of the original script for Unbreakable but didn't make the final version.  So this character has always existed in that universe.  And just like you don't know that Unbreakable is really a super hero movie, you don't really know that Split is a super villain movie until the very end.  Even then, you may not realize it.  But at the end of the day, Split is ultimately a super villain origin film.](#spoiler)   

[Now with that in mind, I think he script was always centered around Kevin.  It's Kevin's story, not the heroine's.  In fact, she's not even a heroine.  She's merely a survivor of ""The Horde.""  I think, most likely, that the story and writing was so focused on Kevin/The Horde (even though it's not apparent to the audience until after the movie is over), that the sort of depth you're looking for isn't there.  That moment of her not being able to kill him simply wasn't about her at all.  It's about him.  It's about showing that he really is this seemingly unstoppable super villain.](#spoiler)",5p1gqe

In Unbreakable, Mr. Glass explains there are always two villains for the hero, a soldier villain who fights with his body and is used as a tool by a mastermind villain who is behind everything and has no physical ability. So if Glass is the mastermind villain, his train crash created both his hero nemesis, in David Dunn, and a ""soldier"" villain, the Horde. Unbreakable is the origin of the former, Split the latter. Also, Glass explains that he thinks individuals with powers have always existed and fought, heroes and villains, and that comic books are just an exaggeration of this history.

But you say he cannot make movies. Period. The later Roger Ebert called Shyamalan ""a born filmmaker"", but you say he cannot make movies and needs to stop making movies.

So 2016 was a big letdown for movies I was really excited about. A big reason for this was trailers spoiling everything. Because of this I decided to stop watching trailers and avoid as much promotional material as possible. 

For Split I avoided everything. On the subway the train would be leaving the station and if I saw a poster for Split I'd quickly look away. 

I knew absolutely nothing about this film going in. It was really a much better experience and the film was deeply engaging and I got lost in it. 

I did not know that was McAvoy until I got home and finally read up on the movie. Just, holy shit, what an amazing performance.

In reading your analysis and choice of words, you strike me as someone who believes they are more intelligent than they actually are.  In particularly, your analytical skills, especially as they apply to movies, seem poor.  I'm not sharing this to be confrontational, but to shed some light on what seems to be a blind spot for you. 

Second, you say my argument relies on semantics but then you don't refute my point.  I said Unbreakable does not feature a real villain fight, one that we are used to seeing in all major super hero movies.  In each and every superhero movie I can think of, the first movie entry into their saga featured a villain who was present for much of the film, influences the hero's life, who later emerged as the superheros main foil and who the superhero has to physically battle (or battle a proxy) in order to win the day and end the movie (Spiderman - the Goblin, Batman - the Joker, Ironman - Obadiah, Thor - Loki, Superman - Lex Luthor, Captain America - Red Skull). Mr. Glass is 100% the ""villain"" in Unbreakable - you cannot deny that.  And yet you want to say the ""orangeman"" is the ""villain"" - that's ridiculous.  Orangeman is nothing more than a typical baddie that the superhero uses to demonstrate or learn about their power.  This is not semantics.

Third, I gave no factual errors - in fact, I'm not sure you know what a fact is.  We have hints that David may be a superhero, just like we have hints the beast may be real.  But not even David recognizes his powers are truly super until the last 20 minutes, just like we don't recognize the beast really exists until the end.  Yes we know that David appears strong, just as we know Kevin has multiple personalities and one could be evil.  But we don't know David is ""unbreakable"" and we don't know the Beast can actually emerge.

Fourth, another interesting cross over is that both movies focus not on the supernatural but on what people can do if they believe they can do it.

Fifth, instead of saying I have an ""inability to understand,"" why don't you EXPLAIN why Casey's storyline is ""thematically similar"" to Davids. 

Sixth, what wild assumptions?  Now you're just talking.

Seventh, the term ""lack of understanding of basic narrative structure"" is what outed you as someone with a heightened sense of importance and knowledge.

Eight, I don't ""desperately"" want anything.  I am highlighting what appear to me to be cross overs that signal a strong connection.  I'm not ""hoping"" for anything to be true.  I'm using reason and logic to deduce a connection between two seemingly disparate things.

While the main character in Unbreakable is unlikely to exist in real-life you can imagine it as a possibility. Same for the antagonist in Split.

ddkwizp,"Uh what?  What is your point with that comment?  If that person is rational and well adjusted at this point, they'll understand the difference between why the bad guy let her go and what her good qualities were.  You are mixing those things up.  Why would you assume that anybody who has ever self-harmed wouldn't understand that difference?  If the person is still having a very difficult time, they may have trouble separating their emotional response and the facts of the movie perhaps.

But that is what actually happens in the film.  Who I'm explaining it to doesn't change that at all.  A red car is red car.  That doesn't change just because you don't want to acknowledge it or have twisted it to think that because I got a red car I must be angry or some other shit.

You have to really twist what happens in the movie to say that the film makers are ""telling self harmers that there is 'redemption' in cutting"".  Nobody is saying that.  You have to completely twist up the plot to get to that.  A guy with a very serious (albeit fictional) mental disorder lets her go because he takes the self-harming scars as a sign that she has suffered.  He let her go because she has suffered, not because she self-harmed.  The scars are just how he became aware of it.  If he knew for any other reasons that she had been abused, he would have let her go or never abducted her in the first place because she wouldn't have fit the mold he was looking for.

The scars where a clue.  The actual reason he let her go is that he was only interested in those who have never endured hardship (this is discussed in the movie).  In his mind, only people who have suffered (not self-harmed) are worthy.  The connection is the suffering/not having life easy. NOT self-harming!!",5p1gqe

If the only reason she cuts is because of some parallel alien-related plot line, the director was careless with a very serious issue that many people suffer from. That's not what it felt like to me though. It felt to me like he read somewhere that many people who suffer from intense physical trauma as children, specially sexual, tend to cut, and that's where he stopped, until it was convenient for his twist.

In the vast majority of cases people cut to reestablish control, to feel like they aren't powerless. A cutter would have resorted to it at least a couple times in the movie.

If you can remove this element and not have to change *anything* in the film for it to make just as much sense, the twist can't really be called terribly important.

You can immediately tell when you're seeing characters saying lines that he's written versus improvised lines, because the lines he's written are so weirdly unrealistic and awkward that you know no other writer would ever have written lines so horrible. 

In the opening scene for Split I thought I was watching a shitty government-sponsored commercial. Had no idea I was watching the actual movie until they got in the car. The dialogue was so awkward and artificial it was clear the actors were struggling with saying them in a way that actually made sense. 

Yeah, he made 2 movies that were okay-ish. A single okay-ish movie and then a slightly worse okay-ish movie afterwards does not a master director make. Personally, I think the long string of horrific dog-shit movies he produced after those two movies say a whole lot more about what kind of director he is. The majority of his movies are completely indefensible.

It's an after credits scene. The movie doesn't hinge on it. If you don't understand the after credits scene, then you've just seen a supernatural thriller with a great performance by McAvoy. You come off very whiny complaining about an after credit/epilogue scene.

I generally make it a point not to engage with Reddit users of your ilk (e.g. attention-seeking basement dwellers who are potentially struggilng with mental illness on some level)—hence my not bothering to read or reply to your previous, wild-eyed, poorly written manifesto. (I love the sporadic and occasionally nonsensical use of ALL CAPs, by the way. It really helps complete the portrait of emotionally unstable dullard that you've so masterfully painted.)

That said, you've made it clear that nuance isn't really your thing. So, since you insist on behaving like a child, I'll respond to your ""challenge"" and talk you through my original comment—the one you took issue with—as if I'm speaking to a child, line by line.

> I would disagree that this is a sequel to Unbreakable. 

Nothing in the article you referenced refutes this. In fact, it seems to support my statement, as evidenced by this comment: ""People have approached me about continuing the story,” Shyamalan said at the time, “but the idea of doing a traditional sequel doesn’t inspire me.""

> It is merely a fun, 10-second long, two-word acknowledgment that the two stories take place in the same cinematic universe. 

Again, nothing in the article refutes this. Again, look to the Q&A portion of the article where ""Split"" is said to merely *reference* ""Unbreakable"":

**Q: So when you began writing the full script for Split, you knew it was going to reference Unbreakable?**

**A: Yes, for sure.**

Also worth noting is that MNS never uses the word ""sequel"" to refer to ""Split,"" nor does the writer, who asks, ""What’s next? Will there finally be a sequel to Unbreakable?"" Wouldn't you think that if MNS regarded ""Split"" to be the sequel to ""Unbreakable,"" he'd have said as much. Apparently not in your little fantasy world, because that would be much too logical.

> I've seen some people trying to defend the ""sequel"" claim by saying it is a thematic sequel but even that is a huge stretch.

Again, not contradicted or refuted by anything in the article. Gosh, you'd *think* that if the whole *Kevin is on the same journey as David* thing was really a key theme, it would have come up at some point in the interview.

And that's all that was said. None of which is refuted by the EW piece, or any other that I've encountered for that matter. The fact that you got your panties in a wad when I pointed out that you'd made a poor argument undermined by factual errors and fallacies—and then ventured down a rabbit hole of minimally coherent rambling in some sad and desperate effort to prove yourself ""right"" on some level—is on you and only you. 

And while I'm at it, here's a Life Pro Tip for someone who either has precious little life experience or simply isn't very good at ""life"" in general (my guess is that it is some combination of the two). For someone seemingly so concerned with another person's ""choice of words,"" you may want to consider that when you begin a conversation with another person with a smug ""Em. Wrong,"" you are likely to get some amount of pushback. Not being an insecure twat myself, I guess is that this is probably a coping mechanism for you, but you should at least be aware of how it comes across to others.

So there you have it. Although you've made it clear that rattling your cage is astonishingly easy, I really do need to say goodbye again. I can only imagine that you'll be angrily banging out a response on your keyboard in some fit of impotent rage but, sadly, it is time to re-engage the ""block"" button and let you drift off into the ether (or wherever vanquished Internet trolls—tail in between their legs—sulk off to when they get their asses handed to them). Still, I'll take some consolation in the fact that screaming into the void almost certainly isn't a new thing for you.

Oh, and I really look forward to you manning-up, admitting that you were wrong and offering an apology. After all your shit-talk, I'm sure the *last* thing you'll do here is expose yourself as a complete hypocrite.

Enjoy your life of immeasurable loneliness.

PS: One more thing for you to chew on, genius. MNS recently said in a separate interview that he is now writing the sequel to ""Unbreakable."" If ""Split"" *was* the sequel to Unbreakable, as you claim, why didn't he say he was working on the sequel to ""Split?""",5p1gqe
dgyey5d,"> The new film proves it's a sequel

Not sure if you're referring to ""Split"" or ""Glass"" as ""the new film"" but either way, your statement just isn't accurate. There's no question that ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" take place in the same universe. MNS was clear about that from the get-go and that was never a bone of contention here on Reddit. They absolutly share DNA, yes. But ""Split"" is not a sequel to ""Unbreakable"" any more than ""Thor"" is a sequel to ""Captain America.""

Aside from the mountain of evidence already put forth, MNS himself reinforced this via Twitter—not once, but twice—this past week:

> It’s taken 17 years but I can finally answer the #1 question I get, “Are you making a f#&@ing sequel to Unbreakable or what?”

If he considers ""Split"" to be a bona fide sequel to ""Unbreakable,"" why on earth would reference ""Glass"" as ""a f#&@ing sequel to Unbreakable""?

And also this tweet, in which he clarifies that ""Glass"" is the sequel to Unbreakable AND Split. Again, if he considers ""Split"" to be a sequel to ""Unbreakable"" then why go out of his way to refer to ""Glass"" as a sequel to both films?

> My new film is the sequel to #Unbreakable AND #Split. **It was always my dream to have both films collide in this third film.**

He clearly sees ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" as two stories—set in the
 same universe—that will ""collide"" in the third film.

That said, its all a moot point really: the original point of contention (long since lost amid the dizzying number of 10-point manifestos addressing points that were never in dispute) was over the final scene in ""Split"" and whether it—in and of itself, devoid of any other
 context—qualified ""Split"" as a sequel to ""Unbreakable."" It didn't then and it doesn't now.

RE: the second portion of your comment ""the second in a trilogy."" This is indeed correct and not in dispute. But again, a trilogy does not necessitate that the 2nd and 3rd entries be ""sequels."" For example, Park Chan-wook's Vengeance trilogy, the Cloverfield films (Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane and the upcoming film) and Kieślowski's ""Three Colors"" trilogy (""Blue,"" ""White"" and ""Red."") I cited some of these examples previously but by that point, your pal had pretty much gone of the deep end and was doing the Internet equivalent of sticking his fingers in his ears and screaming ""Nah, nah, nah...

The alter(s) don't cease to exist, they integrate.  At any rate, I would think that Kevin would at least have been holding steady and wouldn't be getting *more* alters.
Of course, this *is* my remembrance of classes from many years ago, so take it with a grain of salt.


I'm sure that there were some of the alters that the doc came to care about (like Barry), but I still feel like she was more interested in Kevin's condition than in Kevin himself.  Not to mention, there were a lot of red flags that she willfully ignored.

Just that the prognosis for DID is not very good. Most alters don't actually integrate. Anyway, there is no consensus, yet on how to treat DID. It also rarely resolves on its own. If you still read this, thank you so much hahaha!

And to think that I actually thought you had enough poise and intelligence to walk away after having your ass handed to you. But in your defense, I suppose you had to try *something* in order to be able to rock yourself to sleep after that drubbing.

It is really unfortunate that you insisted on behaving like a little twat right out of the gate those 70+ days ago (something that seems par for the course with you), because this could potentially have been an interesting conversation where maybe you learned a little something.

That said, I'll do you a favor and point something out. Which is that trilogies aren't always/necessarily comprised of cut-and-dry sequels. For instance, Park Chan-wook's ""Vengeance"" trilogy for John Carpenter's ""Apocalypse"" trilogy. (Similarly, the forthcoming film set in the Cloverfield Universe will make for a trilogy comprised of non-direct sequels), at least until they pump out a fourth one.

But that's not really the point. Whether or not Unbreakable/Split/Movie 3 comprise a trilogy, of sorts, was **never** the topic being disputed. Your claim—which you made in the most obnoxious way possible—was that the stinger on ""Split"" was *something more* than an acknowledgement that the two films take place in the same cinematic universe. (If you go back and actually read what was written, I had no issue with you supposing that Unbreakable, Split and Movie 3 might comprise a trilogy of some type. In fact, I would have agreed with you and this could have become an interesting conversation.

Seventh, isn't it a little ironic that you're saying I could have let sleeping dogs lie?  Don't you have the same option?

...said the buffoon who just wrote seven paragraphs of utter nonsense. So much for ""succinct,"" eh?

One of the things you'll learn as you gain a bit more life experience (and perhaps education) is that the mark of someone intelligent is the ability to say something concisely. Writing manifestos—replete with use of ALL CAPS, rambling, run-on sentences and basic grammatical errors—just exposes you as someone trying to appear smart. (Another Life Pro tip for you: if you're spending huge amounts of time and energy trying to convince others that you're the proverbial ""smartest guy in the room,"" you're definitely not the smartest guy in the room.)

But seriously... your insecurity and severe lack of self-awareness would be funny if it weren't so enormously sad. It's clear that you have no interest in discussing the topic at hand (you managed to seven full paragraphs without mentioning it once), and that you're woefully ill-equipped for anything akin to thoughtful discussion. Since you've resorted to parroting the points I made about you previously (a clear indication of someone in over his head if ever there was one)—and clearly suffer from a case of last-word-itis—I think it's time that I do what I should have done five hours ago and put you back on block. Have fun shouting into the void and deluding yourself into thinking you've accomplished something other than making yourself look like an idiot (yet again).

Second, your comment on ""life experience"" suggests you have more life experience than me.  You may indeed be older than me, I don't know.  But again, statistically speaking, it is extremely unlikely you have more life experience than me.  It's adorable you think otherwise.

Third, I find it amusing you continue to attack me as opposed to the point at hand.  The mark of a true troll.

Fourth, your comment that conciseness is correlated with intelligence is incorrect and also irrelevant.

Fifth, aren't you the one trying to convince folk they are smart?  When you're trolling someone, it's best not to make obvious errors like this.

Sixth, care to share what evidence you have that I am either insecure or lacking in self-awareness?  Thought not.

Seventh, I'm happily to reengage in the topic at hand.  Did you have a response to the articles I posted that completely destroy your original position?  If so, I'll happily respond.  However, it is becoming painfully obvious that you have no such response which is why you are focusing the conversation on cheap personal attacks.

Eight, to kick it off again, I'll state that my original position was that the last clip of Split was not simply a ""throw away"" easter egg, but a critical scene meant to link Split with Unbreakable and communicate that not only do they exist in the same universe but to set up a follow-up movie that combined the two characters.  You decided to get caught up in the term ""sequel"" for reasons unbeknownst to me, and ignored the articles I posted that clearly show MNS views the two movies as a cohesive unit and wants a third movie to really bring them together.

One of two things are happening here. Either you genuinely don't understand what was written, or you're intentionally misrepresenting my comment in an attempt to get yourself out of the massive hole that you've dug. Either way, I'll make this incredibly easy for you and break this out line-by-line.

> The last ten seconds of Split was significant. 

I never argued that it wasn't significant. I said that it was an acknowledgement that the two films take place in the same cinematic universe... which is pretty significant. Honestly, it's right there in black and white --- use the ""parent"" feature and go back and read it for yourself.

> It was not a ""throwaway"" fan easter egg meant purely as an in-joke or teaser of what could have been. 

Try again. I never referred to it as a ""throwaway,"" an ""easter egg,"" an ""in-joke"" or a ""teaser of what could have been."" 

> It was meant to reflect that both movies exist in the same world, either to make the point that the two movies were connected...

Which is exactly what I wrote when I said the scene was ""a fun, 10-second long, two-word acknowledgment that the two stories take place in the same cinematic universe.""

> You, on the other hand, thought it was a throwaway easter egg that meant little to nothing.

False. See above.

> As evidence, you present no facts to support your point of view. 

I did, actually. You claimed not to read what I wrote. Though we both know you read it but because it obliterates your argument, you're going to conveniently pretend that it doesn't exist. Because, for you, sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting at the top of your lungs in the face of facts that don't jive with your narrow little worldview is safer than having an intelligent, thoughtful conversation.

> After a couple of days of arguing with you, I finally presented you with the words and opinions of the director himself who confirmed that he is working on a third movie that brings the prior two movies together. 

What you've conveniently left out is the fact that you did so to bolster your claim that ""Split"" is a ""sequel"" to ""Unbreakable."" You either didn't read it very carefully or you so badly wanted it to be the case that you saw what you wanted to see. Once I pointed out that the article doesn't support any such claim—MNS never once calls ""Split"" a ""sequel""—you attempted to reframe your argument to exclude the ""Split is a sequel"" component.

And yes, while MNS did acknowledge that he's working on a third film (again, something that has never been in question) and that this film—paired with ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split""—will make the three films a trilogy (either officially or unofficially), there isn't a single instance of him calling ""Split"" a ""sequel"" to ""Unbreakable"" in the article you linked to or any other that I've seen thus far. 

> Your response to this controverted and damning evidence is ""but I don't like logic.""

Actually, my response was to tell you that your rambling manifestos were too long to read and that I was content to let you have the last word and wished you a nice life. At that point, you got angry because you were no longer getting the attention you wanted. And then, after a bit *more* time of not getting that attention (or perhaps out of a desire to just make yourself look silly), you seem to have posted *again* demanding an acknowledgment that you were right. Followed by 70+ days of silence before you made it abundantly clear that, hilariously, you have been stewing on it this entire time.

Once again, I'll point out what should have been painfully obvious to you from the get-go. We agree on 90% of the premise that I put forward on Day 1: Split and Unbreakable take place in the same universe and, paired with a third film, will comprise a trilogy of some type. (I explained previously how non-sequels can be part of a trilogy, something that happens occasionally in cinema). Where we disagree is whether the 10-second stinger at the end of ""Split,"" in-and-of-itself, qualifies ""Split"" as a sequel to ""Unbreakable."" I don't believe it does and you disagree, which is totally fine.

To repeat what I wrote the other day, given that we agree more than we disagree, you could have done what *most* thoughtful, intelligent people do and started your portion of the conversation with something like ""Hey, that's a great point! I don't agree entirely, but here are some additional thoughts..."" Instead, what you did was start the conversation with a smug ""Em. Wrong."" before digging yourself into a massive hole, one which I'm happy to kick you back into for as long as you like.

Given that there really shouldn't be any debate here, you can do one of two things: engage in a little bit of self-reflection, acknowledge that you probably made some errors in how you approached this entire conversation (and, God forbid, maybe even apologize for it) and we can both move on. Or keep on digging that hole you're in, offering up more intellectually dishonest arguments, all while mumbling yourself ""I'm not the asshole, it's the *rest of the world* who are the assholes."" Given your track record, I suspect I already know which one you'll choose but maybe you'll surprise me.

Secondly, I was making clear that there is nothing left for me to ""try"" because I have already accomplished what I set out to do which is prove your ignorance.  The only reason to continue is to engage with the new objective - expose you to your own ignorance.  

(2) ""I never argued that [the last ten seconds weren't] significant.""  This is directly contradicted by your opening remark that the last ten seconds were  ""merely a fun, 10-second long, two-word acknowledgment.""  No further argument required.  

(3) You never specifically referred to it as a ""throw away"" ""easter egg"" or ""in joke.""   Again, you referred to it as  ""merely a fun, 10-second long, two-word acknowledgment.""  My characterization of your words as an ""easter egg"" or ""in joke"" for fans is not amiss.

(4) You claim you argued your point.  I re-read what you wrote.  I see no coherent or supported argument, and you fail to present one now.

(5) The fact that you don't understand that ""working on a third film"" suggests that the SECOND film is a sequel in the trilogy is someone baffling.  Do you need a director to say that the second movie in a trilogy is a sequel?  Or are you arguing the silly and hyper specific point that it is not a traditional sequel in the way that the cornetto films are not part of a traditional trilogy?  If so, you're resting your argument on mere semantics.

(6) I got angry?  Em, okay buddy.

(7) Odd that you say ""We agree on 90% of the premise ... given that we agree more than we disagree, you could have done what most thoughtful, intelligent people do and started your portion of the conversation with something like 'Hey, that's a great point ...."" Can you show me an example of where you have done something like that in a similar context?  If not, that's a little hypocritical.

(8) What ""massive hole"" do you think I've dug myself into?  You seem to acknowledge that I'm 90% correct?  Are you standing in the hole with me?  Logic much?

(9) With all due respect, you want me to engage in a little self reflection.  I didn't attack you, call you personal names, or in any way make personal comments.  I disagreed with your viewpoint, stated as much, and then backed it up.  If you actually re-read our engagement, you will find that you got personal first.  While I pointed out I disagreed with you, you were the first person to call my beliefs ""silly"" ""wild"" and say that it was clear I was ""desperately"" trying to make an argument fit.  To which I responded that you were being ""unnecessarily condescending"" and offered a rebuttal and you simply responded stating ""Sorry...TLDR. Have a nice life.""  The irony that you ask that I self reflect when the record clearly shows you got personal first and then ran away when called on it.  That is why the person said you got recked. Honestly, the lack of self-awareness is amazing.  If you were self-aware, honest, and courageous, you would have the courage to review the posts and recognize that you got personal first mate.
