fwvwxbx,"hey disney, daveed diggs has the perfect weird energy for that pirates of the caribbean reboot you wanna do",hkm7e5
fwv50ar,"I’m glad this is the cast that was pro shot because my god they’re all amazing. Especially finally seeing Groff as King George in all his glorious spittle. The man plays evil weasel so well. The show was always worth the insane price, but it’s a blessing to see it essentially for free. 

I hope they do this for more musicals. Especially since we have no damn clue  when we’ll get musicals again. Please let there be a pro shot of Book of Mormon that Matt and Trey are sitting on.

Edit: Also, while the songs are beautiful on the soundtrack, seeing “Dear Theodosia”, “It’s Quiet Uptown”, and “Who Dies, Who Lives, Who Tells Your Story” performed fucking wrecked me. Just wonderful.",hkm7e5
fwvxp4w,"Underrated aspect of having this musical on streaming: Subtitles

I saw this live and enjoyed it. Went home that night, read some of the lyrics and was surprised by some of the songs like “Satisfied”. 

Subtitles 100% helped my enjoyment and I think will assist new watchers to understand the storyline.",hkm7e5

But then Satisfied comes along and it crushes it ruthlessly, with a dark piece of art.

The whole play is fantastic, start to finish.",hkm7e5
fwx0ydh,"Not enough people are talking about Renee Elise Goldsberry (Angelica) and her performance of Satisfied. An amazing song that she absolutely crushed. 

Satisfied is the one song that I disliked when I listened to the soundtrack but then loved after seeing it live.",hkm7e5
fwvu14w,"“My love, take your time” hits a lot harder when you can see Eliza’s face practically begging him not to go.",hkm7e5
fwtlrkg,"The single biggest revelation from this for me is the performance of Leslie Odom Jr. I’ve seen the live show twice, listened to the cast album countless times and watched every filmed performance of the original cast I could get my hands on. But it wasn’t until I saw him as Burr that I saw the character as more of a socially awkward man desperate to be loved than just a smooth-talking snake. Lin-Manuel’s lyrics always painted Burr as a complex, nuanced man but Odom brought a depth to him that both surprised and mesmerized me.",hkm7e5
fwvl7g8,"Two things always stick out to me:

1. In all my life, I will never be a bigger fan of our nation’s first POTUS than when he’s going OFF at the end of “One Last Time.”
2. The way the story of “Helpless” morphs into the story of “Satisfied” is *chef’s kiss*",hkm7e5
fwvojbm,The beginning of Dear Theodosia when its just Leslie Odom Jr. singing against a completely black backdrop was fantastic.,hkm7e5

fwtojxn,"Never listened to the soundtrack because I wanted to experience it for the first time when actually seeing the show. Amazing, even though it’s less than ideal to watch it this way. Eliza’s ending was so moving, I couldn’t get the lump out of my throat for quite a while after that",hkm7e5
fww933b,The Room Where it Happens/Cabinet Battle/Washington on Your Side/One Last Time streak is the real highlight of the show. All incredible songs and Christopher Jackson’s passion at the end of One Last Time was unmatched.,hkm7e5
fwx1xwb,The shot during Hurricane with all the furniture up around him was incredible,hkm7e5
fwv3frr,"It’s great, but the context is greater. Here we are mostly stuck at home for the 4th of July in the middle of a pandemic and tremendous racial unrest and what do we get? The story of hopeful people fighting for a country, told by hopeful people who still to this day line the streets in face masks to fight for a better version of that country.

I can’t think of nearly anything as patriotic.",hkm7e5
fwylh64,"The face Burr makes when Hamilton endorses Jefferson for president, I see why Leslie Odom won the Tony. I don't think I've ever felt for a character more than I did in that moment",hkm7e5
fwusrzv,[deleted],hkm7e5
fwv72w3,I loved so much that they basically made a teenage breakup song for King George to sing. Jonathan Groff stole it anytime he was on stage.,hkm7e5
fwttvjo,I never really understood why Groff got the supporting actor nomination. King George's songs were funny but seemed really minor compared to everyone else. Seeing the actual performance...I get it. The man dominates the stage whenever he's on.,hkm7e5
fwtjjtc,It's cool finally being able to listen to the Laurens Interlude since it's not on the cast album,hkm7e5
fwtkk1m,"I loved this. I’m glad Disney moved this up from 2021. 

I didn’t expect it to be singing all the way through. I’ve seen a few musicals (stage and screen), and most have breaks between songs, so I was surprised by the constant music. It made the show go way faster this way.",hkm7e5
fwtknpf,Jonathan Groff's spitting in 4K was astonishing. I wonder if that's just him or part of the character?,hkm7e5
fwuuh2h,"I came into this completely blind, like I’ve never heard a single song from it before and know absolutely nothing about the story/real history behind it. All I knew was hearing everyone saying how great it is for ages, and it absolutely lived up to the hype and then some. Going to be listening to the soundtrack for a while now I reckon!",hkm7e5

fwu7ega,Can I just comment on how *incredibly* classy it was to give each of the Ensemble their own credit slide? Great way to show just how difficult and demanding their job is.,hkm7e5
fwtstw4,I just hope the  success  of Hamltion this mean more recorded musicals and plays get put on streaming services. Iv'e seen many fathom events of broadway musicals and plays that diverse to be more seen.,hkm7e5
fwtk5a3,"My review: 

I saw Hamilton in London for my 30th birthday in 2018. After Aaron Burr said his bit at the very start, John Laurens came out to do his bit but they forgot to turn on his mic and left Burr's on so we all heard Burr clear as day say ""for fuck's sake"". I have not yet seen the Disney+ version.",hkm7e5
fwtulhe,Finally got to see Daveed do his thing.,hkm7e5
fwyjvcq,"Daveed Diggs' rap during Guns and Ships damn near set my television on fire. That was *amazing.*  
  
I expected to like this show, but wasn't expecting how much I would love it (I'm normally not all that big on Broadway musicals). This was extremely cool and lived up to the hype.",hkm7e5
fwtiq2b,"For years I've listened to the album, FOR YEARS I've memorized the entire lyrics for at least a dozen songs. FOR YEARS I DREAMED OF SEEING THIS FUCKING SHOW!

My expectations were incredibly high, and goddamn they managed to go even higher.   
It's so so so gooooood I loved every single minute of this almost three hour show.

I really wanna Say that George III steals the show, but Lafayette also steals the show but Thomas Jefferson also steals the show but John Laurens also steals the show but Hercules Mulligan also steals the show but George Washington also steals the show.... basically everyone is pure perfection and steals the show.

 Their delivery, the writing it's so goddamn perfect I swear every line is pure gold, whenever there's a rap debate between Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson for example it's just the best thing ever. I just loved this way too much, I literally bought a month of Disney+ just for this show.

Also: ""Sit down John you fat motherfucker!""",hkm7e5

fwvwcii,"I purposely didn't listen to any of the songs for YEARS (except the opening song which is nearly inescapable) because I told myself I wanted to see it.

Well, the movie was my breaking point and I watched it. Loved every second of it and I'm sure I'll be listening to the soundtrack nonstop for the next couple months.",hkm7e5
fwuprxk,i haven't watched/listened to hamilton in years but i really did forget how hot daveeed diggs is,hkm7e5
fwu08xw,LAFAYETTE!!!,hkm7e5
fwwjsaz,"As a South Asian, I have very limited knowledge of American revolutionary war and the only Founding Fathers I know of are Washington and Franklin. As far as this play was concerned, I barely knew anything about it except that it was based on one of the Founding fathers and that it received critical acclaim. So yeah, you can say that I went in as blind as it can get.

To say that I liked it would be an understatement. I was practically blown away by how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. Be it the script, lyrics, performances, costumes, sets, direction etc. every single element was immaculate. Mixing Rap/Hip-Hop/R&B elements while telling a compelling story was masterful and full credit goes to Miranda for his creativity and brilliance. But most importantly, this play made me want to read up more about the American history, a topic that I barely know anything about. I know for certain that I'll be spending this weekend on Wikipedia reading up about all the characters and their roles in larger story.

I don't really know how to rate plays tbh, but this one just hit it out of park on almost all respects that I don't have a option but to give it a perfect 5/5.",hkm7e5
fwuelf3,"I want all things Broadway to be filmed now and stream. I've seen a few musicals live but how things are right now I'd love to watch Book of Mormon, Dear Evan Hansen, Wicked and many others. I'd love to see plays too. That'd be so awesome.",hkm7e5
fwtkj5g,"Wait for It and One Last Time are the best numbers for me. Great production, but the guy who steals the show is Leslie Odom Jr.

Kudos to Disney Plus for doing this, it’s light in a dark time for a lot of people.",hkm7e5
fx0bjbc,Disney+ should include scene selection by musical number so you can go back and watch your favorites,hkm7e5
fwvihya,I pressed restart as soon as it was over. I’ll probably end up doing it again.,hkm7e5
fysi75y,"I went in completely blind to the album or the show, but knew it was a big deal. I was blown away, pure art from beginning to end. The staging, music, writing, acting, costumes, choreography all of it was just perfect. It took me two views to get all the lyrics (captions helped a lot) but in the end I was surprised by how tight and dense it was. 

Also, the transfer from stage to film was superb, with the editor doing an amazing job capturing the experience of a musical to film. Especially during the helpless/satisfied parts, ten dueling commandments, and the opening bit. Extremely good cuts to all the right places",hkm7e5
fwvl342,"I've listened to the album and saw one of the traveling productions, but, man, this is really incredible. I wasn't really prepared for all the little subtleties you don't see unless you are in the front row. Like how uncomfortable Washington gets when Eliza starts talking about slavery during the finale. 

(Yes, there is the uncomfortable truth that Eliza's dad was one of the biggest slave-holders in the Northern colonies, but when you're going through that era of history that hypocrisy is inevitable.)",hkm7e5
fwybs5a,"Just want to say the fact it was a professional recording of the live play and not an actual film without the audience was the best surprise when I first watched it. I was expecting that this would actually be a sterilized version with no audience, but to hear the crowd involved really made the experience that much better",hkm7e5
fwudau8,"I'm surprised the vast majority of the discussions on reddit had at least listened to the album multiple times but never watched the show. 

I went in completely blind (aside from the opening number which was basically inescapable in 2016). 

This was just 2h40m of pure art. Plain and simple. The staging, writing, performances, costumes, all of it. Just beautiful.",hkm7e5
fwwadma,well i've gotten a lot closer to fulfilling my secret fetish of getting spat on by Jonathan Groff than expected,hkm7e5

fwwhpzk,Never thought I'd say this but I loved everytime Thomas Jefferson was on screen,hkm7e5
fwwv6h0,Jonathan Geoff can sing holy shit! I loved him in Mindhunter and was really surprised to hear him belt that shit out and spit everywhere.,hkm7e5
fwu8zsb,It's Quiet Uptown is such an amazingly sad and beautiful song. *corrected typo,hkm7e5
fwxpo67,"Heard about this Broadway feature on Reddit. People were hyped, so i decided to watch it to see what the hype was all about. Only knew about George Washington before and remembered Miranda as Ted's friend on sitcom HIMYM. Just finished watching it. I'm feeling overwhelmed right now. I've never been to Broadway and this was my first experience ever watching one. Only watched behind the scenes of them on movies like Birdman but never got to see what one could like live. This was fucking great! One of the most awesome experience in my life. Loved it! Thanks reddit for getting me on the hype train. I love you guys!",hkm7e5
fwuoqp9,"Seems obvious to say, but actually *seeing* the production gave me an even greater appreciation for a musical I only knew from the soundtrack. I was always dazzled by the lyrical/musical pyrotechnics, but watching Phillipa Soo and Jonathan Groff's performances made the heavy drama and silly comedy (respectively) land much better.

Also, Hamilton really is an opera more than a musical (since the whole thing is sung with only a few ""recitative"" passages). And that definitely adds to the unique energy of the experience as does the minimalist production design. Can't wait to watch it again.",hkm7e5
fwvnc3r,"Did you like Hamilton? The majority of the people onstage, behind the scenes, and in the front of house are currently unemployed. 

And despite the rest of the economy “restarting,” there is no sign that this industry is coming back anytime soon. The earliest shows I've heard of are MAYBE Spring 2021.

fwwq3mu,Damn to see Jonathann Groff Spit in 4K. Amazing work.,hkm7e5
fwytplf,They should do this with more musicals. I’d pay 10 dollars to see a HQ version of Dear Evan Hansen right about now after seeing this. They are closed anyway. Why not.,hkm7e5
fwtoofi,"Never been a musical fan but this one goes beyond the genre. Hamilton is an experience unto itself. It may not have the electricity of the live show, but it remains one of the most thrilling shows you could ever watch just from the power of the music and performances alone. At first i figured it may not be my cup of tea but by the end I felt like I had watched a dense, rewarding epic. My personal faves in the cast were Daveed Diggs n Jon Groff.",hkm7e5
fwyso6l,I'm generally someone that doesn't like musicals and I'm not sure if it's because I'm drunk and it's the fourth but I legitimately cried real tears 3 times.  I absolutely understand why this sold out everywhere it went,hkm7e5
fxdhycu,"Everyone was great, but George Washington fucking *slayed* it. His back-and-forths with Hamilton were probably my favorite parts of the whole show.",hkm7e5
fx66abg,"The energy of the cast is amazing. Normally I'm not really a fan of musicals that are pretty much non-stop singing, but this was really captivating. The Room Where It Happened is probably my favorite song in the show, and I love how it recurred several times. It was a great alternative to seeing it live.",hkm7e5
g05qz6h,"As someone who dislikes musicals, this is easily my favourite movie of the year.",hkm7e5
fwtok1u,"Serious question. Can this be nominated for best picture? It’s kind of unprecedented to have a broadway show released as a film with just the recording of a live performance (as far as I can recall).

Edit: as another user mentioned, this is a weak year for film releases due to covid so that could further push along its odds!",hkm7e5
fwtmj7u,"As someone who had not seen the play and had only listened to 2 of the songs prior (Alexander Hamilton and Guns and Ships), this exceeded my already high expectations. While Lin was good and the music and costume designs were great, the side characters really made it for me. Aaron Burr, sir, played his role very well, King George III had such solid interludes and I loved Daveed Diggs's performance as both Lafayette and Jefferson. The first half is definitely stronger than the second half, but that's really a testament to how great the first half is. Having an intermission was a really nice decision. Overall lives up to the hype, I'm excited to watch it again.",hkm7e5
fwyrj58,"Eliza’s gasp gave me full, powerful chills. Haunting, inspiring stuff.",hkm7e5
fwyrvwm,"Can I just say how awesome it was to keep the live audience in for the taping? There was something intangible about hearing their subtle (and raucous) reactions, the actors playing for them. That was truly, truly a small, but genius decision. It's as close as we'll ever get to ""being there.""

Best 4th of July gift.",hkm7e5

fwvowh5,i'm loving all the shoutouts to classic hip hop tracks.,hkm7e5

fwyt42e,"I don’t have anything new to add to the conversation about this movie and play that hasn’t already been said. What else is there to say, it’s an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. The songs, the performances, the lyrics - everything. 

It is absolutely mind blowing Lin-Manuel came up with this and wrote all the songs just from reading the Chernow bio. He is an absolute genius. Best musical I’ve seen hands down. No contest.",hkm7e5
fx344qg,"After listening to the album countless times, I’m blown away by how much seeing it changes my opinion of some of the songs. 

Satisfied wasn’t one of my favorites on the album but seeing it in the show is absolutely spell-binding. 

And of course King George is even funnier in the flesh than what I imagined listening to his bits. 

What a gift to have this recording.",hkm7e5
fx5vv57,Laurens and Hamilton gave off major hook up energy,hkm7e5
fx9i4fs,"My only exposure to Hamilton was listening to soundtrack several months ago and I liked 2, maybe 3 songs but was ultimately relegated to wondering why it wasn't clicking with me the way it was for the rest of the country. Watched the movie and was floored. Aside from some numbers missing from the soundtrack, the whole production from the blocking, the lighting, the costumes and of course, the visual performances were the missing pieces I needed. Everyone was phenomenal and I think the film direction was very good. It was intimate enough to really feel like you have a special seat in the house that no one in the audience has but not at the expense of the need to see the production in-person to really take in everything else about the production that the cameras didn't capture in the moment.",hkm7e5
fxd3o87,Do most people prefer the first or second act? I strongly prefer the second. I've been listening to the songs from *The Room Where It Happens* and on on repeat while going about my day.,hkm7e5
fwtu9er,I will go to my grave espousing the fact that the second half of Hamilton is the superior half.,hkm7e5

I really, really, really liked this.",hkm7e5
fx4gept,"Renée Elise Goldsberry absolutely kills it in 'Satisfied'. I thought there was so much emotion in the recording, but to see the performance accompanying it...wow.",hkm7e5
fwvqoj5,"Thank God for this movie! 

I’d still kill to see Hamilton live with any cast, but the original cast needed to be preserved for posterity. It’s hard to believe anyone will ever top Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr. I already loved him from the original cast recording, but seeing his full performance in all its glory was just godly.

Hope this does well enough to inspire other productions to follow suit. I’d give anything for a recording of Hadestown that preserved André De Shields‘ Hermes for posterity.

I get why producers are afraid that these videos might hurt ticket sakes, but I’m ready to buy a ticket back to NY just to see as many shows as I can after watching this.",hkm7e5
fwyvnoc,I definitely feel for Burr a lot more after seeing his facial expressions up close. Really makes it more clear that he’s just desperate to succeed for his parents and daughter.,hkm7e5
fwylx8s,"My favorite part was Helpless/Satisfied scene, as an individual part, they are pretty good. But If you combined them, it is like firework on a screen,  it was so well executed especially the rewind part did the the job to made those aren't pretty disjointed.",hkm7e5
fx5wr7i,It took seeing it live for the Helpless/Satisfied connection to finally click for me. Man that is brilliant. I don’t think I’ve seen retelling a previous song from another perspective in a play before.,hkm7e5
fwv9tpb,Gotta say the hype is real on this. Doubted for years but I can’t deny it.,hkm7e5
fx1m2oi,"Going in 100% blind, this was simply incredible! I felt like it took me around 3 songs to really get into it, but once I was in, I was completely hooked. It 100% lived up to the hype for me.",hkm7e5
fx6d48p,"Went in totally blind. Never heard any of the music. Nothing. How the fuck does something like this get made? It seems so absurdly complex and the talent to make it happen is insane. It’s actually going to get me into more musicals. I thought the whole thing being sung/music centric would be my least favorite aspect, but goddamn some of these songs. Very happy I just dove in.",hkm7e5
fwuchy9,"So I'm the rare person who was able to come to this pretty much blind - I knew Burr killed Hamilton and why (because I took history in high school) but anything in the play that wasn't really well-known was new to me. And I'd heard bits of a couple songs but had never listened to the vast majority of it. I've kind of maintained willful ignorance because I'm not really the type to pay big money for theater tickets and I knew this filmed version was coming, so I thought going in relatively blind would be the best way for me personally to experience it.

I don't know if I was right, but this was dope. From reading through the comments here, I see that there's something of a first half vs. second half conflict - I preferred the music from the first half but was more invested in the story of the second half. I'm glad to finally be in the loop on Hamilton.

EDIT: One quick thought - I did not realize that musical theater involved so much spitting.",hkm7e5
fwxsgxa,I am very critical of pieces that I feel are overrated. This is not one of those pieces. Hamilton expertly blends complex themes and concepts with memorable music that inspects the inner workings of many dynamic characters. Definitely deserving of the 90%+ ratings.,hkm7e5

fyqcoy0,"I appreciated how the producers didn't include any audience applause when Lin-Manuel says his opening line: ""My name is Alexander Hamilton."" Instead there's just silence for about two seconds, like on the cast album.

Almost surely there was a massive crowd reaction in real life, at least there was for that line at the theater production I attended. But by keeping it silent immediately afterward, the producers preserved the key to that line: that Hamilton isn't greatness or a legend *yet*.",hkm7e5

What's up with all of the ""Hamilton"" hate on social media lately?  I thought this play was widely beloved, including by liberal folks.  Now all of a sudden, it's ""problematic?""  What changed?

People think they are so clever by saying the founding fathers were terrible people. They lived over 200 years ago, times were different. Some of their actions seem unfathomable by today's standards, but the incredible things they did to form America cannot be denied and their stories should be told.

Damn that show kicked all the ass. I'm glad they did this. I'm glad I got to see that cast doing it. Because the show's never come close to me yet. But once it does and once covid is gone... I'm seeing this show live as often as I can.

That of course was canceled due to COVID and I was devastated. From the first 10 seconds of watching the Disney release I was obsessed and have watched it 3 times so far. 

My husband definitely doesn't love it as much as I do, but it's like the perfect blend of my love of history and music. 

Absolute favorites would be Daveed Diggs and Leslie Odom Jr. The first time I heard ""Love doesn't discriminate between the sinners and the saints"" I broke down.

fx2nodl,"I can't help but wonder how the founding fathers would react to Hamilton...Y'ALL KNOW they'd cackle at King George, and head bob to Guns and Ships at least. I think the most underrated song is Meet Me Inside-I know a LOT of people don't like it because of it being in 7/8 but THAT is why I LOVE it. It's so off kilter which makes sense cause you know....freaking someone got SHOT. Also it just feels so awkward like we're in the middle of watching a father scold his son and again...love it.

Also I'm already seeing people say two things: it glorifies the founding fathers and that's problematic. And the other being people don't get why it's a mostly POC cast. Now, it's very clear why it's a POC cast for the most part. One this is a rap, R and B, Reggae, Jazz, based musical with that classic broadway showtune stuff. Do y'all know many WHITE folk stunning at those things? Other than Eminem for Rap? Miranda picked the BEST PEOPLE for the job in those fields. It shouldn't matter that Christopher Jackson is belting out One Last Time over Jonathon Groff-and let's be real, the people complaining about it being a mostly POC cast, are probably rednecks who are confused, lacking in education, and lacking in respect. Now, the OTHER reasoning for it being mostly a POC cast, is simple: Miranda wanted to invoke or pay homage to the people coming into The United States of America TODAY as immigrants looking for the better life, much like how THE FOUNDING FATHERS THEMSELVES were immigrants. So he imagined it in that light. Which is genius.

Now, for the other complaint...the play does NOT glorify the founding fathers. Do people just not pay attention any time Jefferson is on screen? And during one of the Cabinet Battles Hamilton literally states ""we know who's really doing the planting."" So they do acknowledge slavery MORE THAN ONCE in the play the other times being Who Lives Who Dies Who Tells Your Story, and during Yorktown. Not to mention the multiple times Washington himself is just completely exasperated which is actually on brand for him according to historians. They did a rather good job presenting the FFs as the every man for the most part.

Hamilton is STUNNING. But people need to remember that the play is NOT meant to EDUCATE. It's meant to ENTERTAIN people. And the sheer fact that it HAS educated so many people on the life of these men is one a cool bonus, and shows that the American education system needs a serious overhaul-I had no idea who Hamilton was before this play. My mother on the other hand, learned all about him-I got my education in the southwest she had hers in the northeast. So maybe it's a regional thing. But either way, I freaking love Hamilton. I've listened to the score soooooooooooo many times before this so FINALLY being able to actually see it is so nice. 10/10",hkm7e5
fwvkl3o,"Man, this play was FANTASTIC. I had no clue what to expect. I've somehow been living under a rock about it. So I was confused at first. It seems that some people don't understand the theme/point of the play. /u/kneeco28 posted below: 

>The American Revolution was a bunch of white men who didn’t want to be taxed, so white history sees their revolutionary efforts as just; they killed for their emancipation from England; they were militant. That, to white people is acceptable. But those same white people talk shit about Malcolm X for being too violent–a man who never started an uprising against the government leading to bloodshed. Violence is only acceptable in the hands of white people; revolution is only okay when the people leading the charge are white.

>Hamilton makes those people brown and black; Hamilton depicts the revolution of which America is proud as one led by people of colour against a white ruling body; there’s a reason King George is the only character who is depicted by a white man. The function of the visual in Hamilton is to challenge a present in which people of colour standing up against oppression are seen as violent and dangerous by the same people who proudly declare allegiance to the flag. It forces white people to see themselves not as the American Revolutionaries, but as the British oppressors. History is happening, and they’re on its bad side.",hkm7e5

The camera work and sound mixing made it so great, and you could see the little nuances the actors added, namely Daveed Diggs, that insanely talented mother fucker. I've loved his work since *Blindspotting*, and his performances in this show really  show how god damned talented he is. Leslie Odom Jr. may have beat the cast with his ability to sell how slimy Burr was in the story.

The one I didn't see praised nearly enough was Christopher Jackson as George Washington. During his good-bye song, the emotion he shows stunned my parents to the point they gasped. They aren't theater people at all, and only knew of it because it's everywhere, and they really enjoyed him a lot.

fx0e62f,"I had an initial reaction in the comments earlier (coming into this 90% blind) but some individual thoughts with a couple days reflection:

I had a pretty good idea who would play a big role in the show based on what the actors had done since, with the exception of Phillipa Soo, who was great. I have to think we'll see her blow up in the next couple years, and if we don't it's only because she doesn't want to.

Like many others, I thought Leslie Odom Jr really stood out. I also thought Renee Elise Goldsberry was great.

My favorite song was ""Satisfied"" and the other song I have gone back to in the past couple days is ""Guns and Ships""

Open question, especially to people who have been long-term Hamilton fans: At this point, what's the ""better"" way to experience the show - the recording of the original cast or a live show by the new cast? From the POV of someone who isn't really a theater person, watching a different cast seems like it would be really weird with how linked the original cast is to the role.",hkm7e5
fwv7rn9,"Although I am familiar with the American Revolution in a broad sense (through high school classes and listening to the revolutions podcast/other material about it), I surprisingly had hever heard about Hamilton until a couple weeks ago when the trailer got posted on reddit. I'm not sure how the youtube algorithm never recommended Hamilton to me, seeing as I've listened to the Les Miserables songs there a million times.

Obviously it peaked my interest, since I really like history, but I was a little skeptical about it. I'm not the biggest broadway musical type of guy. Not that I dislike them - I just don't get exposed to a lot of musicals. These things aren't really talked about much in Brazil, where I live. I'm not the biggest fan of hip hop either.

Anyway, before seeing it I listened to some of the big songs (mainly the opening song and Satisfied) and immediatly I knew I was going to love it. And holy shit, it didn't disappoint. I fucking loved it, every second of it. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a goddamn genius.

I hope that sometime in the future Hamilton goes back into theaters, because I would really, really like to see it live.",hkm7e5
fwz5g93,"I know we're seeing this through 2020's eyes now, but I wish it explored more about the question of slavery, and how even back then, we were just a few votes short of ending it right out of the gate.

Ending Slavery was one of the things surrendered up during ""in the room"" where negotiations were made in order to get approval for a Federal Bank.

Hamilton was no fan of slavery, and it was something he wanted eliminated, but knowing that a bankrupt new nation was one that wouldn't last 8 months, he agreed to a back room deal of ""we promise to address that right away"" and the votes never again came close enough. For Washington, yes he had slaves and that's a horrible problem. But he was another who voted several times for it's elimination, but the lack of enough votes to make that happen was a process he was compelled to trust - that they had just bled and died to build a new government based on representation and civil voting process and that even something as morally corrupt as slavery needed to be addressed by way of that new form of government - it's up to us and even those who come after us to judge whether that was the right position or not.

Uncomfortable as they may be:

Fact: his first job that is described in the show as a trading company was in fact a slaver

Fact: Hamilton did NOT own slaves but was raised by two owned by his mother after she died.

Fact: Hamilton was no fan of the native Americans, and supported the aggression against them.


For those curious, Hamilton's concession was a pragmatic one where a brand new nation that was up to it's eyeballs in international debt, if it were to suddenly free an enslaved workforce, would be compelled morally to provide them with shelter, food, and medicine rather than just let them go to fend for themselves - and they needed to secure loans to pay for it. The only way nations would lend to one another was at the highest levels. No nation would loan to individual states - so we needed a bank to consolidate debt, make a few good faith payments to France, and then tell the world""hey we pay our bills. wanna help us feed our poor?"" and then boom, slavery can end and we can make sure we aren't killing thousands of slaves who need help getting on their feet. His hope was to secure funding internationally to provide for freed slaves, and to offer bounties for immigrants to come to America - to pay them to come here as a means of replacing the lost labor force. Im not justifying him for accepting a 'we'll address that we promise"" on slavery - he alone was given the burden of getting our country off it's hands and knees financially, and did what he thought was right. Again, history will judge him - hopefully it will do so fairly.

In spite of the character being largely comic relief, if you want to pick a villain from our founding fathers, I believe Thomas Jefferson is a superb candidate for that title. Much of what he is credited for accomplishing during the founding of our nation was the result of a committee of others taking what he did and making it functional. He was very much a 'Virginia, and then the rest of you"" kind of politician, and that included his views on slavery and taxes. In order to get Virginia to join the new Union, Hamilton accepted Jefferson's proposal that slaves should count as 'three fifths of a person.' What did he get in exchange for taking emancipation off the table? Private Property (land ownership) and the Federal Bank. Was he wrong? Morally yes. But historians mostly agree that he alone placed the US in a financial situation in which the abolition of slavery could even be discussed. Which is why Jefferson wanted to end the Federal Bank. Jefferson loved owning his own people. A lot. He specifically wrote that blacks (I wont use his word) were not capable of thinking. A real asshole.

That one bullet - it's so sad to stop and imagine how much it changed the course of our nation. I believe Hamilton would have eventually become President, scandals and all, and that one of his kept promises would have been an end to slavery.

I hope that this musical does right by him and that legacy - he was one of the good ones, and a bona fide war hero. And giving his wife her due: what an incredible woman she was. She would have made a great President, herself.

Alexander was not perfect, possibly not even 'good' - but if anyone wants to judge Alexander Hamilton, or anyone else featured in this show, I urge you to read the biography that inspired Miranda to write this show, and hold your judgement until the end. When each of us has taken our last breath, we can only hope to be judged as a whole person - that our efforts to heal and restore outweigh our evil and sin.",hkm7e5

* The few shots from behind the stage towards the audience really broke the illusion for me.

I mean, even though we all have our favorites, I think we can *all* agree that the entire soundtrack as a whole is amazing. *All* of the music is incredible, which we knew from listening to the soundtrack on repeat the past few years, but seeing it performed live on stage with the original cast? Man, it lived up to *every* single bit of hype. I can't wait to see this on Broadway when Broadway opens up again next year! [Insert bitter grumbling here about the fact that Broadway shut down due to COVID-19 two days before I was supposed to see it this past March.]

Side note - after seeing it live - I can confirm that my favorite characters in the show are *exactly* who I thought they would be while listening to the Soundtrack. In no particular order:

1. King George

2. Thomas Jefferson

3. George Washington

4. Alexandra 

But again, like the music itself, every single performance was incredible.",hkm7e5
fxhaptp,"Is this the complete production of Hamilton that a person would see on Broadway?  Or is it edited or abridged in some way for Disney+?

My daughter said this presentation of Hamilton is missing dialogue normally seen on Broadway. Couldn’t confirm on the Internet so asking people who have seen it. TIA.",hkm7e5
fxvkyck,"Went into it blind and loved it. Bit confused that there are so many people here who have spent a load of time listening to the soundtrack before seeing it; seems like that would spoil the experience somewhat, whereas doing it the other way round would only enhance one's enjoyment of the music.",hkm7e5
fwu9x83,"I'll preface this by saying I adore Lin Manuel as a writer, as a rapper, and as a human being...

The man should not be the lead though. Like Seth McFarlane in The Orville, his actual presence in the show he wrote (In my opinion) is the weakest part of it.",hkm7e5
fwvgt9z,"Just finished watching it, and I adored it. Going into it I expected to enjoy it, but wasn't expecting just how much I did. Was completely enthralled by it. It was just one great song number after another. Terrific performances all around.

EDIT: Had me misty eyed at a few points too, which was surprising.",hkm7e5

fwztt2y,"This was fantastic! I saw it with my family on the 3rd & 4th. It's a unique way to tell a story and groundbreaking...something different and something good. It's a feel good, escapism, watercooler type thing that I think we need at the moment.

fx0iokl,"I think this is the best thing to have ever happened anywhere. Period. However, I’m troubled by the fact that a lot of people will walk away thinking they now have a good grasp of early American history. This is not at all the case. This is a piece of historical fiction.",hkm7e5
fx35ate,"I saw it at the Pantages a few years ago, from the nosebleeds of course, and was absolutely mesmerized. Being able to see it up close has reignited my love for it!

My favorite songs were always “The Schuyler Sisters,” “Right Hans Man,” “The Room Where it Happens,” “Burn,” and “Say No To This,” but now I’ve grown a particular affection for “Dead Theodosia.” Am I alone here? I feel like it’s criminally underrated and is such a beautiful ode from a parent to a child.

Anyways, I loved it. I think some people are reading a little bit too much into it here. The criticisms in terms of how it portrays the morality of our founding fathers are valid, however, it is still a musical. The same criticisms apply for Les Miserables, but nobody seems to vilify that play like they do Hamilton.",hkm7e5
fx3ln0g,"I wanna give my top 5 because a couple are a little unconventional. I REALLY LOVE Guns and Ships and Meet Me Inside. But it seems they're pretty underrated among the fandom....

Number 5 - Alexander Hamilton 

Number 4  - Meet Me Inside

Number 3 - Guns and Ships

Number 2 - The Room Where it Happens  

Number 1 - One Last Time

Huh after looking at this list I'm kinda leaning towards a lot of Washington songs....I find the man completely utterly fascinating to study (I love studying history in my spare time because now more than ever it's important to learn about our past, plus I've always loved history....I actually almost got a history major rather than film) so I guess that makes sense as to why I'd gravitate towards him the most...Not to mention holy GOD Jackson KILLED IT during One Last Time...oof.

I've known about this musical for a while and I know the whole soundtrack but have never seen it in person. The film was better than I could've imagined! I got chills so often and cried a few times. I'll be watching it again very soon!",hkm7e5

fx9gug0,I watched it Friday and have been listening to the soundtrack non-stop ever since. I love it.,hkm7e5
fx6qyu2,"Watched it on Friday, and I guess it's Tuesday now, so my review is a little late, but my thoughts really haven't changed. 

I grew up around various 'nerdy' type hobbies (band, choir, drama), so I kinda knew a couple of the songs going in (most notably, [from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5tx9tSBwnE) ). And I knew the basics of Hamilton's story, just from History. 

My 13 y/o sister knew it was a play some of her friends/teachers really enjoyed. That's about it. We sat down, and were instantly swept in. The story is historically interesting, the music is upbeat and fun, and the casting choices are all great. Daveed Diggs gave one of my favorite performances of the year. 

My dad, who was taking a nap (not caused by the show) up until intermission asked a few questions, but was also quickly caught up in the excitement of the second half. 

Since then, I have constantly found myself returning to it in my mind (both songs and content), and heard my dad and sister say ""Have you seen Hamilton? You gotta, you'll love it!"" tp countless amounts of people. 

I never thought I was even much of a stage show type guy, much less musicals. I looked up ticket prices last fall for my birthday in December and was a little put off by tickets still going for $200 for the back of this midwestern theater, 4-5 years later. Looking back, those tickets would have been worth it, and I look forward to hopefully seeing it live in the future.",hkm7e5
fwxft50,"The script, writing, lyrics, songs (whatever you call it) are absolutely incredible.

>Burr, you disgust me

>Ah, so you’ve discussed me

>I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

I have seen the show live before and let me tell you it's so nice having the option to turn on subtitles. Obviously there are so many iconic songs, but my favorite segment is  Helpless into the ""rewind"" into Satisfied. So well done, absolutely fantastic. Also King George is hilarious

Minor gripes:  
I echo the sentiment that Lin-Manuel Miranda just feels... kind of weak overall. But you know, he wrote it so as another redditor put it, ""I don't begrudge him casting himself""  
I don't think the staging, choreography, and overall production is really anything to write home about. I'm a casual musical fan so don't hate me, but I do enjoy the ""spectacle"" of the more mainstream stuff. I think Hamilton is incredible, but it's script, songs, and acting are definitely the highlight.",hkm7e5
fx0fqo9,"Started going down imdb deep dives for the cast, and I predict that a lot of these actors are about to rocket into the stratosphere now that so many more audiences will get to see their Hamilton performances.

Will this be eligible for the academy awards this year? If so, it better clean up.",hkm7e5
fx1g0lk,Fucking amazing.,hkm7e5
fwww90a,"Only complaint with the film, not necessarily the musical itself, is that I feel a lot of the shots chosen and editing is kinda too hectic and a bit messy. The scale and position on stage of the actors gets a little confusing at times due to constant switching of camera angles. The focus on whenever to focus on individual actors versus the whole cast also seems not perfectly executed and it seems a lot of times there’s a close up or wide shot just for the arbitrary sake of keeping their editing momentum.

Despite that, there are plenty of really cool movements and edits, but I think ultimately I’d rather the production create less of a movie version—something likely decided to make the musical more accessible to even wider audiences—and go for a more standard video producing route where the end product is more so designed to just be a high quality recording of the production (this is what most musicals that do get recorded end up doing).",hkm7e5
fwwytrs,"I thought this was a wonderful presentation of the show, but I was surprised and eventually distracted by a search for a continuity error during Satisfied! If you look at the flowers on Renée Elise Goldsberry’s dress, they disappear and reappear based on what performance night is being shown. As an editor, I thought it was an amusing little easter egg to catch!",hkm7e5

fwti1fw,"I saw the show last year and have been listening to the soundtrack almost non-stop since then. Having gone to the show without listening to the music was both an advantage and a hindrance. 

After the show and getting familiar with the music, I was dying to see the show again and had planned to surprise my wife with tickets to NYC shows. But alas the pandemic and other life events came into play.

I've been dying to see the show again and this has been amazing so far, this is the next best thing.

The video is fantastic as is the performance and I was worried about the sound but they got a great mix IMO.

Also was cautious about the visuals and camerawork when compared to the view from a seat from the theater. 

The choreography was a lot more involved than I remember, can't wait to watch this over and over again.",hkm7e5
fwuom00,I felt like Lin Manuel Miranda kinda sounded a little weak in this one. He sounds much more assured of himself in the album recording.,hkm7e5

fwwz6c7,"So I was lucky enough to go and see the show live in London last November and it tied with The Book of Mormon as my favourite musical I've seen live, meaning I had good feelings coming into this.

Overall it was well done as a recording of a great musical but I feel like Lin-Manuel Miranda isn't a brilliant singer. He's outclassed by many of his fellow castmates and was so much weaker than Karl Queensborough, who was the Alexander Hamilton I saw in London who was legitimately brilliant. Miranda's not terrible but I feel like he's a much better writer than he is a performer.",hkm7e5

It is my first time seeing Hamilton in the full and it is very very unique  i think adding rmb and rap makes it eaiser for people to understand his story. i think now people will start using rap in musicals just like how superstar made people put rock in other musicals i liked all the characters espessily Lin as Hamilton and Diggs as Lafeyette and Jefferson  and songs were brilliantly catchy

fwtwbfe,"It’s great because it’s still Hamilton, but I’m a bit disappointed by some of the filmmaking choices. As a live show one of the best aspects is seeing the amount of coordination and artistry happening across the entire stage with the full ensemble. Between the frequent tight shot selection and number of cuts I think a lot of that got lost. Maybe it looks slicker this way? I really don’t get the decision making behind it. This show was designed to be watched from where the audience is sitting. Yet almost none of the shots show that perspective. And with some of the quicker cuts, ones that cut from very different angles, it’s harder to track the dancing of the ensemble happening around the sides and in the upper part of the stage.",hkm7e5
fx63p1b,"This is a musical not to be missed. The writer of this musical is an absolute genius. Every song is perfectly written to tell the story. Although I am not a fan of Rap music, yet I can't help but being captivated by all the songs, as if enchanted by a spell, and remained spell-bound till the end. It is a musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton. And in case you may think this is boring, think again. The way the story is being told kept the audience at the edge of their seats. Every character is so unique and the writer makes them become so alive that we feel as if we are inside their lives, not just looking from the outside as an audience. I especially like Groff's King George III. Groff not only gives the character a comedic touch but he also causes the audience to dig deeper into the mind of the monarch. In fact, the internal values and thoughts of each individual character is masterfully displayed to the audience. We look into their hearts, we feels their internal struggle, we relates to their strengths and weaknesses, we sees our own humanity in them. One can't leave the show without reevaluate one's own life value and purpose. It is that compelling. It deserves many praises.",hkm7e5
fwuiufk,"I avoided listening to the soundtrack, so I was really excited to learn this was coming out streaming!

It was very very good, I think I loved it. Yes, it was a bit corny at times, and yes, it kind of glorifies people who don't really deserve glorification, but it was still a really fun show that had a lot of awesome moments.

One criticism I have is that I'm a bit disappointed in the set design. It's pretty damn bland, just wooden stairs and walkways and whatnot. Like, it's cool and gets used in all the usual Broadway-show ways, I guess I was just expecting a little more iconic ""look"" to the set.

Everything else was great though, I really hope this will be the start of putting Broadway shows on streaming platforms after their runs because it's good for culture.",hkm7e5
fwv2zlq,"Once you get used to the inherent corniness of it, it’s a lot of fun. Lives up to the hype. The technicals of it were incredible, particularly the lighting. The rig was impressive and I genuinely loved the stagecraft.

fwxs0qi,"As a guy who's friends with primarily theatre kids, the last five years were rough as I was bullied for not seeing *Hamilton*. Now that I have seen it I will join them in making life hell for those who haven't seen this masterpiece.

However, the intermission seemed to kill the momentum it had and the beginning of the 2nd act seemed to suffer from the same slow build that the first did. 

I remember seeing Phantom on Broadway and coming back from the intermission, the orchestra played a medley of the music from the first half.  Maybe that would have been useful here.  Something to build back up to the 2nd act.  

Still, after a slow start (again) I felt like it found its rhythm again and was an amazing show.",hkm7e5
fwtkun7,"Trying to think while watching this why Disney would have originally waited another 15 months to release this in October 2021

I only knew a handful of songs from this, and obviously had never seen it before - it’s pretty good overall, the set is incredible and of course it’s pretty strong all over 

Saw someone else say on here that the second half isn’t as strong as the first, I’d agree - maybe it was the runtime but I wasn’t feeling it as much after the war ended

But this is the problem with a filmed version vs being actually in the audience - I’m not as invested watching it on a screen.

""It's Quiet Uptown"" is an incredible track that calls back from previous tracks and a single song covers grief, disintegration of a marriage, and reconciliation of a family. Each time Alex calls for his son or his wife, there is hope with a current of grief undercutting his cries for them.

And the first time he's finally realised what is enough, it is at the expense of his family.",hkm7e5

I assumed all the cast would have been minorities, but the English and English loyalist were certainly cast as white actors. At first I thought it was too on the nose about white tyranny - and maybe it is - but the real antagonists of the play were Burr and Jefferson.

I really liked the use of the rotating stage to display distance, and characters moving to and away from each other metaphorically.

fwxjjd6,"I found there's a certain operatic quality to it.  When people think of opera, they think of fat ladies in Viking-esque horned helmets belting out songs in Italian.  But opera is really more a style of theatre where everything is song, as opposed to a musical where there are songs interspersed throughout the show but the main focus is the dialogue.  This entire performance was one song after the next, to the point where there was almost no ""proper dialogue"" at all.",hkm7e5
fx6fu7m,"Perhaps an unpopular opinion but as someone who has seen Hamilton on stage twice, watched the famous bootleg, and listened to the album approximately infinite times; I found this movie to be merely okay.

What works:
- The chance to see the original cast, giving it their all, at the peak of the show’s success.  There are so many amazing performances my favorite being Daveed Driggs and Renee Elise-Goldsberry.

- The camera catches a lot of little details and nuances that I never caught on stage.  There are some interesting “cinematic” choices as well taking advantage of angles the audience could never see.

- Sound and visual quality are excellent with one notable exception

What doesn’t work:

- The camera constantly has to choose between individual performances vs the overall stage direction.  As a result a lot of the experience is somewhat lost.  A good example is in You’ll Be Back where by focusing Jonathan Geoff’s face in closeup you can appreciate one aspect of his performance you lose a lot of the subtle body language that better sets the character.  In another example the double turntable stage is in itself a marvel of stage direction and storytelling much of which cannot be appreciated 

- The lighting was atrocious.  It was almost impossible to fully appreciate Phillips Soo’s devastating rendition of Burn when half her face kept turning bright blue. It was a huge distraction. 

The Verdict:

Regardless of its flaws I still think this movie version adds to my overall appreciation for the show by highlighting some performances and showing me things that I never noticed before.  However if you ever plan on doing so, I would suggest waiting to watch the show on stage first and then coming back to watch the original cast on D+.  However if you don’t think you’ll ever be able to see Hamilton the way it was originally intended, on stage, then you could do a lot worse than this version.",hkm7e5

I understand people love it, but I didn't see anything that made me understand why it's held up as this unbelievable work of art for 5 years. Maybe it's just not my thing.",hkm7e5
fwudt91,"I watched it. Felt long and I don’t really understand the hype. The music is catchy, the performances were good. But it felt like a chore to sit through. Guess I’m not a big musical theater person. I assume seeing this live is much better.",hkm7e5
fwz8jmm,"I don’t know. There were parts I adored, but a couple sticking points that made me not really love it overall as much as I’m seeing so overwhelmingly in this thread. 

Just a personal taste thing really, but I found that the hip hop wasn’t landing so well for me. I had a hard time keeping up with some of the lyrics, and other times they felt like they were trying to be clever rather than clear and as a first-time listener it just felt kind of... self-serving? I’m not asking to be spoon-fed but the combination of not really feeling the style *and* sometimes racing to keep up wasn’t necessarily enjoyable. Plus it was corny at first but I got over it, much like how every other musical starts a bit corny. That much is forgivable. 

The lyrics are indeed very witty and inspired, but there were a couple parts that were gratingly out of place. Like when Hamilton was narrating his trip to see Washington immediately after arriving home, or when the ensemble switch to chanting “forgiveness” when Eliza and Hamilton reconnect in the final scene. I know I literally just criticized other lyrics for being excessive but this is a plunge in the wrong direction. I feel like there could’ve been something a little less on the nose. Hamilton and Eliza’s understanding was clear enough as it is, it was kind of inadvertently hilarious for the ensemble to narrate it just in case that notion somehow flew over the audience’s head. 

Finally, I was quite bothered by how this historical fiction was basically reducing the complicated source material to a joke in a song. These guys were slave owners, they were complicated humans living in a complicated time and I suppose I was expecting a bit more... respect? is that the word I want? with the touchier bits of the subject matter. Having Hamilton reference Jefferson’s slave-ownership during their rap battle as a clever clap back mic-drop gotcha moment meant to elicit a snicker just left a sour taste in my mouth. I get that this isn’t straight American history (of which I’m unfamiliar with so there were many points that I was lost on but that’s my problem) but I feel like you can’t be so reductive with such a critical and sensitive topic. I have no idea how to do it better, and frankly maybe there is no way to do it appropriately in a fictional piece of light entertainment, but the current treatment just didn’t feel right. 

Now this is the part I mention the things I loved like King George and the sisters’ dynamic and the choreography and the brilliant ensemble and the unbelievably talented leads in order to reinforce that I’m not a hater and did legitimately enjoy the viewing, but those few thorny bits prevent it from elevating Hamilton past a 3.5/5 for me.",hkm7e5
fwu0eu2,"Really interesting to watch.  I've never seen the stage show, but I've heard the music so many times. It was jarring, the little differences, between the soundtrack version and this.

After song after song it started becoming a bit of a chore to get through the 160 minute runtime and I guess I checked out by the end of it.

Who spots Alexander the moment he enters the dance? Eliza does.

Who manipulates her ""smarter"" sister into getting out of the way? Eliza does.

Who is always portrayed as faultless, kind, and a victim. Eliza is.

Who arranged to have Alexander sent home from war against his will? Eliza did.

Who would abandon her husband for months at a time to go on vacations with her rich family? Eliza would.

Who burned the pages she didn't want us to see? Eliza did.

Who shaped the ""narrative""? Eliza did.

Who decided that the villain in this story was Burr? Eliza did.

The story of Hamilton is the story of a man who had no control over who lived, who died, or who told his story and it's not until the end of the story that we learn we've been getting Eliza's version the whole time.",hkm7e5

Now that I’ve stated how much I love it, my only gripe is the casting. I completely understand why voices of colour were wanted, and needed, but at certain points, like when Hamilton dissed Jefferson for owning slaves, while Jefferson was black, just kinda took me out of the experience for a moment or two. I only wish there could be a way to be historical and have coloured vocal representation in a hip hop rap musical.",hkm7e5

And I think the general canceling movement is pointless since Hamilton already made a shit ton of money throughout the years 

There are many many hot takes on Letterboxd regarding Hamilton being tone deaf and glorifying “white founding fathers” and whitewash US history (some of them do have merits but most of them are just shitty hot takes). To me - If there is one thing I noticed, it would be this: while Hamilton in the musical did call out Jefferson for slavery, the musical didn’t seem to explore in depth how Hamilton feels about Eliza’s family's ownership of slaves? I understand that Hamilton is not a dry history lesson but I felt that had the musical incorporated that aspect into his character it would be very intriguing.

While looking on differentiating responses about Hamilton, I also found out that there is a play called “The haunting of Lin Manuel Miranda” by Ishmael Reed [(who is a very well accomplished writer of his own right)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_Reed), which serves to refute historical omissions of the Hamilton musical in a playful way.

The lyrics and casting were mostly uninspired, the ""hip hop"" elements were few and far between, and the story of Hamilton's life was not compelling. If I wasn't bored by the music I was annoyed. It's typical Broadway/Disney fare with a bit of hip hop, r&b, and jazz--not enough to carry it for a non musical theatre fan like myself. The King George bits were brilliant and memorable. I wish the entire play had that much polish and punch. I did also enjoy the rotating stage, though I think it could've been used to greater effect.

fwvbx9f,"My first time seeing it, was worried I would be disappointed. And I was a little. There were some stellar lyrics and songs that gave me chills, but I had some issues:

* Really surprised at how un-charismatic Lin Manuel Miranda is. I expected a multi-talented star, but his voice is nasal, he's short, and not very inspiring. He made Hamilton  seem needy and desperate. And the character and others told us how smart he was, yet he didn't seem to actually do or say anything very smart. Outside of the cabinet rap battles which were stinging.
* Lots of the lyrics were just too expository and banal. In my mind lyrics should be multi-layered and poetic, not everyday speech like for example ""I just got home and now I'm going to Washington."" Okay, thanks for your itinerary.
* Some of the songs sounded stolen from Eminem, especially My Shot.
* The sexism, speaking of lots of women to ""deflower"" and how female characters had no goals or personality outside of their attraction to and relationship with Hamilton. The male characters did.
* Several unnecessary scenes including one with an adult actor playing his 9-year-old son and the entire sequence where he cheated on his wife. Could have cut that and still had the others confront him later on.
* The end seemed very bloated.

So, overall very good, but not the masterpiece I was expecting. Could be with some editing, cutting, tightening up. But doubt that would happen at this point after so much acclaim. Which is too bad. I was a fan of Alexander Hamilton, but I actually like him less after seeing this depiction of him.",hkm7e5

fwxcie6,His screen/stage presence is incredible. I couldn’t look away from him whenever he was on stage.,hkm7e5
fwx0zx4,"One of my least favorite actors tbh. Which isn't saying much because its the difference between ""really fucking good"" and ""absolutely perfect"". I liked Eliza, Angelica, Burr, and Lafayette/Jackson more",hkm7e5
fwyvv6y,Yes yes yes,hkm7e5
fwxh17k,"There are so many little things to discover and re-discover every time you listen to (now watch) it.  So much tragic foreshadowing in the first act, so many themes and motifs set up and elaborated on.

fx7c84w,I’ve seen this show 3 times live and listened i dont even know how many times and this never occurred to me damn,hkm7e5
fwxfm7k,His performance of “One Last Time” floored me. The emotion in his face at the end... it was the most moving performance of the show for me.,hkm7e5

fx66uya,"I also disliked Satisfied on the album, but in the show it's one of my favorites",hkm7e5
fwvy3ar,I really liked Eliza listening to the recording but I fucking loved her watching her on screen. Everything about her performance is so expressive.,hkm7e5
fwvx5d1,The camera shot right after that when Eliza leaves and Burr is there is perfection.,hkm7e5
fwwn3zq,"I lost my oldest daughter to a genetic disorder at six days old. She died in my arms. When Eliza holds her son as he is dying, I lost it. I was uncontrollably crying (thanks PTSD), but it was beautiful. I told my husband I can't stand other people making that gutteral cry of agony because that same sound as escaped from me and I feel it in my very being. She nailed it. My husband and I sobbed all through the song about surviving the unimaginable. It is very, very true. Also, Dear Theadosa, makes me cry every time because that is how I feel about my daughters. One is 7.5 and the other turned 6 today!",hkm7e5

fwuc26n,"His fixed rictus smile throughout the show that didn’t touch his eyes was masterful. 

He holds it to almost the very end while he spits venomous lines in sweet tones. He embodied the theme of the character in a way I did not even comprehend in my listneings.",hkm7e5
fwtsc0k,"Leslie is fantastic and easily the best performer in the show, imo, besides Daveed Diggs. But my only minor complaint is the lisp he puts on during the stage performance. You get used to it after a couple songs, but he doesn't have it on the album version. Not sure if it was his idea or the direction he got.",hkm7e5
fwv2t7d,"His performance makes me want Miranda to write a sequel about Burr's life after he shot Hamilton.  It was wild.  He tried to start a war with Spain, went on trial for treason at Jeffersons behest and won and Alexander Hamilton Jr. represented his wife in their divorce litigation.",hkm7e5
fwuctwq,"That was something I noticed too! I saw the play when it came through my town and it was a different actor. He was a lot more smooth and self confident than Odom throughout.

I liked my guys interpretation and singing more but I see why Odom was a hit.",hkm7e5
fwwktz2,Going from The Room Where it Happens immediately into Schuyler Defeated back to back is insane from Odom. I have no idea how he caught his breath in time to get back on stage and rap calmly about switching parties. Dude is an athlete as well as a performer. Not something I noticed from the cast recording.,hkm7e5
fww6p8x,Agreed. I've listened to the album god knows how many times and finally got around to seeing the show in London last year. But none of that ever made me feel as bad for Burr as I did here. Seeing his enthusiasm in the election of 1800 and then seeing his face slowly drop as Hamilton supports Jefferson.,hkm7e5
fwzdtnx,"Yea by the end, when he's heartbroken that history has made him a villain, I think thanks to Leslie's performance I really felt bad for him. I'm sure with the wrong actor doing what's on the page, that wouldn't hit as hard emotionally.",hkm7e5
fwvcop3,"He struck me as very Salieri in ""Amadeus""",hkm7e5
fww5zs3,"Leslie is just otherworldly for me. I saw the London version, it was brilliant but nothing compares to Leslie as Burr imo

Also, his YouTube bts videos on the official Broadway account (I think) during the height of the show was so fun and enlightening. Once, he was still getting dressed up like 5 minutes before going on stage it literally have me anxiety, idk how he can do that and be Burr in a flash. It was insane.",hkm7e5
fwx0vwj,"This! I’ve listened to the soundtrack so many times but here, you really see Leslie trying to emote Burr as the tragic hero he is. I really appreciated that the movie doesn’t just copy the audio from the soundtrack. There’s so much nuance from all of the actors, but Leslie and Daveed in particular are my favorites.",hkm7e5
fx0cuio,"When I saw the play live, I actually thought the actor I saw (who wasn't even the main cast member of the non-Broadway version I saw, he was a stand-in) did an amazing job conveying the frustration and desperation Burr felt, especially during Non-Stop and The Room Where it Happened.  I loved, for example, the way he say ""Hamilton wrote the other 51!"" during Non-Stop and never quite felt like Leslie Odom Jr's voice on the official soundtrack captured the sense of frustration in quite the same way.

But actually seeing Leslie Odom Jr's performance, not just hearing it, added so much.  It's still hard to compare it to the performance I saw the first time just because it being the first performance I saw biased me, but I definitely thought Leslie Odom Jr's performance lived up to the hype.  The way he maintained that forced smile through so much of the show, in particular, really added a lot to the character.",hkm7e5
fwx11es,You described my thoughts better than I could. I saw it on stage once and already appreciated the complexity of what brought Burr to murder. Watching Odom was the first time I ever truly felt for him.,hkm7e5
fwvomwn,Helpless into Satisfied is the best 1-2 punch in musical history imho.,hkm7e5
fwvszeu,"Helpless into Satisfied killed me. It was the most moving part of an extremely moving musical. If you would’ve described every scene to me beforehand I would’ve rolled my eyes at it, but it was absolutely perfect.",hkm7e5
fwvskem,"I think that transition is much better filmed than it is live, or at least it worked better for me. I'll admit freely that I was super confused when I saw this live. Because without subtitles, and with lyrics coming at you so fast, and with being far enough away from the stage that you can't really see the subtleties of everything, I TOTALLY missed that Satisfied was a flashback. 

So here my dumbass thought that Angelica and Hamilton were flirting at his and Eliza's wedding reception. And so I was always like ""yo, that's fucked up."" But now it makes so much more sense!",hkm7e5
fwwny8w,"We literally learned about peaceful transfer of power because Washington forced the system to work by stepping down. Listen to the man who plays Washington, Christopher Jackson, talk about him. He is so articulate and passionate. I wish I remember the interview. He talked about how it was hard because Washington was a slave owner. He did do cruel things. But he was kind in other aspects and he talks about coming to terms with the fact Washington was a complicated man. His acting makes me love Washington in a lot of ways. He cared about his men. He was very close to Lafayette. He did so much good, but he wasn't perfect. He was flawed. You see so much of that passion in, One Last Time. History Has It's Eyes On You, gives me chills every time.",hkm7e5
fwwpabh,The staging of Helpless/Satisfied was fantastic. Both great songs but the live version really elevated the power of that juxtaposition,hkm7e5
fwywndj,"I don't know why it particularly affected me so much, but the helpless/satisfied combo was a straight gut punch. I'm not one to get moved to tears by movies that often and I definitely didn't expect it from a musical. Totally different experience seeing them perform it rather than just hearing the album.",hkm7e5

fwv5z1w,"There’s a two part Broadway Backstory podcast talking about the evolution of the rotating stage. The most shocking part to me is that it wasn’t going to be in the show originally! The set producer originally wanted it, but it got taken out. He was still really into the idea and took it back to the team and was tasked with picking specific parts of the story where the rotating stage would add to the staging of the production. When he did, they approved it and the rest is history.",hkm7e5
fx35umb,"The cast did a performance for ""love for the techies day"" when they have [the stage manager call out all the stage cues as they performs *The Ten Duel Commandments*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqE-mGI5OaM).

It really gives a window into how much is going on behind the scenes during the show.

Note how this is only the 15th song in the first act and they're already on light cue 450.",hkm7e5
fwv9gvm,That coordination is insane. And so is the ensemble and cast performing dances on it. It also looked like there were at least three separate rotating sections.,hkm7e5
fwvex4y,"So all of the turntable movements are cues that send them to prerecorded positions.  The stage manager calls each cue and the operator hits ""go"" and watches the stage to make sure nobody will get hurt while they move.  This allows for a great deal of precision, because it means that the turntables will always go to the same place every time.",hkm7e5
fwvo16o,Stage Managers! Every time you see a play they are the ones making sure everything works. A great stage manager is invaluable.,hkm7e5
fwzoe1l,The lighting too! The fact that they can create new scenes and add/remove characters via lighting (or lack thereof) is absolutely outstanding and demonstrates exactly how well-choreographed the off-screen actions were.,hkm7e5
fwx344c,That's honestly one of my favorite things about Broadway. The technical setups that they have can be pretty crazy. The turntable in Hamilton is actually pretty basic compared to some of the other things I've seen.,hkm7e5
fwv3pb3,If they ever do a full on film version I demand ALL THE TURNTABLES,hkm7e5
fx2ltix,“Oh how the turntables...”,hkm7e5
fwtpbto,"Same. I let stupid pitchfork convince me that the ost wouldn't be as good if I hadn't seen the show first, but i don't think that would've been the case. The music works really well on its own. Although taking it all in for the first time was thrilling..",hkm7e5
fwx7t8z,"I did the same thing up until I saw it in NYC last July. I figured I’d love it forever, why not experience it for the first time on stage and listen to it for the rest of my life on CD.",hkm7e5
fwy6nih,So fucking beautiful. There's things that I feel like a film version of this musical can't replicate and one of them is that shot in Hurricane.,hkm7e5
fwykzjm,Seriously! What an amazing way to show off that kind od effect in the easiest way possible!,hkm7e5
fwv4tmd,"Can't upvote this enough. When Hamilton first came to Broadway, we thought it was groundbreaking because it was racially inclusive to the core in a way that aligned with its message (especially since Broadway is a predominantly white space.) Now, the filmed version is transcending and capitalizing on the musical's goal of inclusivity by being inexpensive and accessible to everyone. Hamilton's cultural impact is for everyone.",hkm7e5

fwvi636,"I gotta say, with all the racial unrest, 1% vs 99% bs, covid relapse, and especially the damn republican vs democrat forever war, I really wasn’t loving America much right now.

Hamilton kicked me in the patriotism hard and made me really respect this country again.",hkm7e5

He and Jefferson stole the show.",hkm7e5
fwv0xsl,"Hamilton is one of those things where the hype is so astronomical yet when you finally see it (esp if you're going in blind with the music), it's like OH YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE.",hkm7e5
fwvx27d,"Agreed 100% on all three parts of your comment. I had somehow avoided hearing any of the songs over the years despite hearing the massive praise the show had gotten (not out of any sort of protest or anything, I just never bothered to listen to the soundtrack). So I went in thinking ""it would be pretty amazing if this could live up to the hype"" and I had an absolute ball watching this. The songs, the character decisions, the stage design, all amazing.

As well performed as all the characters were, Jonathan Groff definitely just went for it and made the most of his limited minutes. I think King George is only in this for maybe 7 minutes, but everything Groff did made his parts memorable. The walk, his facial expressions, he nailed everything.

And yeah, I found myself crying during that last song. Particularly when she gets to saying that her greatest accomplishment was opening the orphanage, and that camera shot shows Hamilton looking at her from the back of the stage. Something about that just really hit me",hkm7e5
fwze7eq,"Haha this is basically the exact comment I came to write. Totally get why this musical is so insanely famous and that end song reallllly got me. I had to go take a walk after n collect myself. I made it harder on myself because I put headphones in n listened to the song a few more times on repeat xD

The King was fucking brilliant. That was such a great touch.",hkm7e5
fx1i65y,"I'm a middle-aged man, I'd heard all the songs, but the first time I saw a stage production of this I fucking sobbed at the end like a child. Had no idea that I'd be so emotionally moved by this.",hkm7e5
fxti93x,"The King, Jonathan Groff of Mindhunter, should play Wesley in a miniseries about his time becoming the Dread Pirate Roberts .

People love The Princess Bride so this would have a built in audience",hkm7e5
fx4je57,Exactly how I felt after watching. I was blown away by the performance and music. It also helps that I love hip-hop. The sociopath King George is amazing...that actor is bewildering.,hkm7e5
fxhg51d,"Right? I can’t get “you’ll be back” out of my head. That tune is so catchy, yet so menacing at the same time.",hkm7e5
fwvad8g,He was honestly amazing. He was having so much fun being the villain.,hkm7e5
fwvno47,I got the sense it was meant to sound like British pop music from the 70s and 80s. Like the Beatles or Elton John. If so it’s quite clever haha.,hkm7e5
fwvejus,"The rest of the show has sooo many layers and is busy - in a good way. The King's parts are great because the give you a chance to breathe and laugh. 

I caught a movie about Mad King George that was filmed in the 90s - Helen Mirren was his Queen. It was actually quite sad to watch. George was dealing with mental illness to a severe degree.",hkm7e5
fwtwztc,Easily the biggest thing lost when just listening to the soundtrack. Amazing performance and I think the nature of it being a movie (close-ups of his little facial movements) really plays to those strengths.,hkm7e5
fwu7sg8,Scene stealer. I kept hoping he'd pop up more.,hkm7e5
fwvom83,"After slamming in hip hop ensemble pieces one after the other with tons of movement, they stop everything to bring in one man in a silly gown, shine a spotlight on him, and have him deliver a song with an entirely different genre base...

And he _nails it._ Like, I don't have words for the amount of confidence and stage presence required for him to _carry_ the show's momentum like that. On paper everything should crumble with that kind of tonal shift. Which tells me that they wrote this in to tailor to his ability.",hkm7e5
fwu9vmv,"He's got an edge, very captivating, totally missing if you just hear the songs.",hkm7e5
fwu4p28,"I think it is because he steals the show with such a small part.

Conversely Lin Manuel Miranda did not win the Tony for his performance in the lead role when he arguably deserved it.",hkm7e5

fwtt8nf,It completely caught me off guard. I somehow never noticed that Laurens just disappears in the album version despite him outright saying he died in the opening number.,hkm7e5
fwvrlzr,It was also shocking to hear Eliza crying out after getting used to the silence in the soundtrack,hkm7e5
fwtoc6j,"I was really surprised that there was nearly no dialogue at all. They sang for 2 hours and half. 

It must've been exhausting to sing that long 8 times a week.",hkm7e5
fwu7atp,I feel like the lack of dialogue is a big reason as to why Hamilton always felt so accessible compared to other musicals. Whenever I listen to a musical theatre album I need to have the Wikipedia synopsis open in another tab so I have the context of what happens in the story between songs (because if you watch a bootleg you're DAMNED TO HELL FOREVER). Hamilton doesn't need that because the entire story is on the album,hkm7e5
fwttcph,"Another musical where it's just mostly songs and little to no dialogue in between is *Les Misérables* 

Most definitely give that a watch if you haven't! What an amazing story it is.

Although, I'm talking about the 2012 film with Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe. I haven't seen the Broadway show yet.",hkm7e5

fwwqd4d,"Musicals are basically a medium that uses music with words to tell a story. Opera specifically uses music throughout the whole thing. So for Hamilton, it’s been classified as a “hip-hopera” due the the more modern music but having songs through the whole thing.

RENT is also technically a rock opera on stage, but the movie just turns it into a normal musical. I think someone also mentioned Les Mis which is also counted as an opera. 

There’s also jukebox musicals that use songs already written, like The Blues Brothers.",hkm7e5
fwveac7,Jesus Christ Superstar is another great one for that.,hkm7e5
fwzcl3g,"I have no idea if this is accurate, but it appears the show took a lot of cues from Les Miserables.  The rotating stage, the centrality of a male rivalry, key scenes taking place in taverns, central theme of revolution, etc.   And like Hamilton, Les Mis has very, very little dialogue outside of the songs, as well as a huge number of songs overall.  And frankly, I love it.  Les Mis is my favorite musical, and I'm very glad it appears to have inspired a lot of parts of Hamilton.",hkm7e5
fx0fnf8,"I think that's part of why the rap works so well.  There's plenty of stuff that *would* be dialogue in a typical musical, but it's just rapped instead.",hkm7e5
fwu7jbj,Most musicals written in the last 20-30 years have little to no dialogue anymore! Everything is exposed in songs,hkm7e5
fwx5l6f,"Hadestown, too. It's a show based heavily on Greek mythology, which, of course was passed down by oral tradition for centuries, so it makes perfect sense that it would be sung through in its entirety.",hkm7e5
fwtmg78,"Groff is a notorious spitter in the theater world. When he was in Little Shop of Horrors Off-Broadway, the front few rows were nicknamed the splash zone.",hkm7e5

fwvfxbl,"When the show took off there was actually a bit of a to-do from the ensemble about how they felt under-recognized and under-compensated for the work they put into making the show as successful as it was.

I guess they think it would hurt sales of live tickets, but I really don't think so. The people who love theater will still buy tickets, and if anything this is likely to create more fans who buy the soundtrack or fly to NYC to see the shows live.",hkm7e5

Laurens in particular for me because I was never into his parts when I was just listening, but every time he was on screen I knew he just took it away.

The framing of shots to match and give extra dimension to what was happening is something that *sounds* like it should be easy but taking that careful consideration isn’t something all directors say they can do and it pushed this version above and beyond. Though the Newsies recording was also very high quality (though not as much as this film) so I guess the expensive and extensive 4K filming and high quality recording equipment helps as well lol.

Long answer: Best picture is strictly for feature films, actual film productions. This version of Hamilton is a stage play that got filmed.

The final action sequence handled the duel fairly because the idea of Hamilton pointing his gun in the air first hasn't ever really been established. There are conflicting reports and it's hard to tell fact from legend now.

Most duels, you took turns where the offending party fired first. Guns were so horribly inaccurate (no rifling) that many ended with both taking their best shot and just missing and it was decided ""God says you should get over it"" and it ended. It was rare to actually die in a duel because if you intentionally threw away your shot, you had the ""God meant it to end this way"" as your cover.

It was considered murder (and thus judged by God as such) if you were in the wrong but fired a fatal shot. So the accused went first, and usually either fired in the air or made a really bad shot. Then the offended had to decide if their offense was so great, that God would see this killing as not murder.

Burr rightfully gets to be the heel in American History because he fired a fatal shot (hitting the ribs means he aimed for the torso with intent to land the shot) over having his feelings hurt.

Hamilton said that he should fight his battles with words, and Burr said, ""nah I'll just shoot and kill you instead.""

There are far more than just 10 moments in a duel in which someone can say, ""alright Im over it I got offended but I dont want to kill you"" and Burr pushed past all of them. Hamilton could have apologized, but he believed what he wrote and published, and stood by his convictions. In the end, he likely believed that his fate was in God's hands even as they took their shots.",hkm7e5

Their only other option would have been to release it under either 20th Century Pictures, or possibly a better fit at Searchlight Pictures, and then have it available on Hulu instead of Disney+.

This is simply my personal reason for being more ""meh"" about those to tracks in particular. 

As far as for what my favorite track is? It's Nonstop. It closes act one perfectly as we sum up exactly who Hamilton is and why he rose to founding father status bringing back all the motifs from earlier tracks. What we don't know is that those exact traits will lead to his death.

But it's a bigger issue now because the BLM movement is in full swing across the globe, making this oversight seem particularly insensitive.

However, the show was never meant to tackle the racism of America's past, and one could argue that having non-white actors play the Founding Fathers is itself a kind of ""Fuck You"" to the white supremacy of America's founding, though it could also be seen as lending credibility to the myth version and giving it a ""minority-approved"" stamp.",hkm7e5

Salieri was only 6 years older than Mozart and by all accounts was at the very least friendly towards Mozart, if not something of a friend.  
  
Big historical difference regarding Hamilton/Burr was that Burr didn't seem that remorseful about killing Hamilton... for the most part.    
Burr never wrote down his thoughts like Hamilton did, so the only things we have to go on are interviews and eyewitness accounts from those who were there.
 
Years after the duel, Burr jokingly referred to Hamilton as ""my friend who I shot,"" which doesn't really seem to imply much remorse on his part.   

 
However, those who were at the duel said how Burr seemed shocked immediately after he shot Hamilton, as if he didn't think he would have actually hit him.   
  
It wouldn't be until decades after the duel that Burr finally admitted that ""Had I read Sterne more and Voltaire less, I should have known the world was wide enough for Hamilton and me.""

fx2zh25,"> They lived over 200 years ago, times were different.

This is true, and it's important to know about their philosophies and the good that they did.

At the same time, it being over 200 years ago doesn't change the abhorrence of their views on things like slavery for the most part. Progress isnt linear, the time statement doesn't matter as much as people think it does (civil rights in any country have had times of great progress followed by times of rights stripped away - it doesn't automatically get better with time). There were plenty of proper abolitionists in the US at the time of independence who believed that slavery contradicted everything that had been fought for. Some of these people were founding fathers or otherwise prominent in the independence struggle. 

More were convinced of the evils of slavery whilst still continuing to have slaves - that shows great moral failure and at its core, a refusal to give up their own privileges - Washington and Jefferson being the two most prominent examples. The President (and his wife) that was sandwiched between the two shows that slavery was far from accepted by everyone, even in the upper classes and leadership group - John and Abigail Adams were loudly opposed to slavery (Abigail more than John) and anti-slavery groups were very common. Saying that Washington and Jefferson were products of their time and that this makes their slave ownership (and in the case of Jefferson, the active and long-term rape of Sally Hemings) somehow acceptable, albeit wrong in modern eyes, ignores the actions of contemporaries like Adams and Laurens. Slave owners knew better. They just decided to not take action for a multitude of reasons, none of which are okay. 
 

> You better pray that in 200 years no one looks back upon your actions and says how much of a horrible person you were because of something everyone did 

The point is that it wasn't something that everyone did, even if the everyone just includes upper class white men (which it shouldn't, because we literally buy into the black people don't count logic).

This (and every) Fourth of July we celebrate the fact that our ancestors (or likely *not* ancestors…all the better) tore apart ties of family, friendship, geography, and shared history in the name of dying for the sake of political ideals, and killing those who would stand against those political ideals.

Very few “liberals” I know, even those who are pretty far left indeed, so much as have the will to not invite those who Trump-voted to a family reunion for fear of causing drama or being “discriminatory.” The fascists have somewhat smaller numbers, but they have integrity, unity, and determination. Those of us who stand against them do not have *any* of those things as a group.

It’s all lost: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”

I loved Hamilton in 2015–2016 in the same way you seem to. I took Lin-Manuel Miranda at face value when he said it was “America now about America then,” and frankly I think it contributed to my (and many other’s) complacency at the time.

Now, with examination, it’s a neat bit of theatre and dramatizes some fascinating political ideals and innovations; but as a work of art with deeper meaning, it’s just another interesting but problematic fluff-piece at best, and an outlet for performative wokeness without deeper examination or sacrifice at worst.

When I saw Hamilton in Chicago, the alternate Hamilton was performing and his stature was Kevin Hart-esque.

My favorites from half 2 are Room Where It Happens & Washington on Your Side, and though there's a bunch of really good songs, 6 out of my top 8 are in the first half, as well as all the inspiration and fun parts.

So when it came time to sitting and watching this I definitely had high expectations and overall it met them in terms of performance, with the exception of Miranda as Hamilton. I thought the actors playing Burr, Washington, Jefferson and King George were all show stopping and exceptional, while Hamilton stood out as MUCH less dynamic of a performer to the point where I was getting distracted and my enjoyment of the show was hindered. He’s not a great singer, and his voice lacks bass and power. 

All the credit to the world for the man, this is a masterpiece of writing and music composition no doubt. But yeah he was not very good as the lead in my  opinion and I was really confused as to why I can’t find anyone else really on this thread that’s calling attention to that.",hkm7e5

The best example that can be given is that in the show, three people--Burr, Jefferson, and Madison--confront Hamilton about the funds to James Reynolds. But the real accounted version is three other people--James Monroe, and two other guys.

fwuayag,"You’ll run into this issue a lot with filmed theater, and I think one major issue in translating to a filmed medium is the dynamic range of lighting. The benefit of sitting in a live audience is that you generally have choice as to where you can look and can adapt your eyes, be it on the subject of the primary spotlight or the characters in the secondary lights or even what’s going on in the tertiary lights in the background. In theater, you can absorb the cumulative effect near instantaneously. However, in film you run into the issue of a frame with lots of light values, some of which literally can’t be adapted to a television because of camera settings which prevents you from getting a clear look at both a subject in bright lights and a character in the shadows at the same time. Doing tight shots and medium shots keeps things looking nice and maintains the purity of the lighting and the focus of the story, even though it admittedly dilutes the magic of theater. In other words, I think it’s a feature, not a bug.

Edit: grammar and clarity",hkm7e5

fwwz47r,"One thing that is lost between the D+ version and live stage version is how they use the stage. I agree, it is bland, but there are a lot of really cool choreography that happens off camera during some of the close up.

When they added all the camera angles, you lose a lot of the ensemble moving the bullet across the stage from Burr’s gun to Hamilton. In person, that scene is mind blowing.

fwvto3i,"One little clever note about the actor reusage thing:

In the beginning, when everyone is introducing themselves, Mulligan/Madison and Lafayette/Jefferson say “We fought with him.” 

This applies equally to both the roles they play. As Mulligan and Lafayette, they “fought with him” in the allied sense, and then as Madison and Jefferson they fight with him in the other sense.

Then with Laurens/Philip, he says “Me, I died for him.” Once again, he is speaking for both of his characters.",hkm7e5

It works on multiple levels and is also just a common theatre tactic.

I just got tired of hearing it to the point where i have 0 interest in experiencing it myself ever. 

It makes me wonder how good it actually is compared to people jumping on the hype bandwagon now.

That said, before the downvotes I'm sure are coming, I'm glad people seem to be enjoying it. I'm glad it didn't come out and people get angry. We all need more feel good moments.

A far as history and who the good guys and bad guys are: it's really complicated, and I think the purpose of the show was to say that.

Was Hamilton a good guy? He wrote consistently about the need to end slavery, and the hypocrisy of being a free people that owned other people. He didn't own slaves, but was raised by two. He didn't like slavery but he worked for two slave trading companies most of his life.

He openly called for the end of slavery, but when ""in the room"" negotiating, he traded it for the right to Private Property (unheard of in the world at that time) and approval for a Federal Bank. He would later write that it troubled him that he did indeed throw away the only shot at emancipation (never again would congress be that close to passing it) but if it had, the nation would have been bankrupt and taken over by England, France, or Spain within a year. He felt that in order to end slavery, the US had and obligation to care for freed slaves until they we capable of being fully independent - they needed homes, food, and medicine. The other was a replacement work force. He wanted to pay at the federal level, former slaves and new immigrants to work on farms and other agricultural productions to maintain trade and provide food. To do that, the US needed loans. To get loans, it needed a bank. So while he never abandoned emancipation of slaves, he felt that setting up the new country financially so it could afford to was a justification for putting it off.

It's also fair to point out that he never spoke out about the treatment of Native Americans at all.

So how do we support this show knowing this? Because we have to hope that people will see it, will want to learn more, and will then discover more truth as a result. Im willing to give this show a pass for side-stepping slavery, and canonizing a few people who deserve an objective judgement, if it means people will be inspired to learn more.

All of us can only hope that when we die, our lives are judged not by pulling out the worst things we've ever done, but by examining all we've done and hope that we've done enough good to at least get a 'well he could have been a lot worse' as our legacy.",hkm7e5

And again to be fair, many of them wanted it ended for that very same reason - and several times during those early congressional meetings, the votes were very close. Yes, it's a horrible shame that our country, several times, sustained slavery because a few people voted 'no' but consider that we had just bled and died and buried a lot of people, men women and children, for the ability to decide as a people by way of elections, representation, and vote. To immediately throw that away to start enacting new reforms against the will of those votes, would have ended everything - and either England would have taken back over, or France would have come to 'collect the debt.'

Well, it's partially because it's the language and the environment that Lin-Manuel Miranda knows well, so he viewed and re-told the story of Hamilton through that prism. Consider that ""In The Heights,"" LMM's previous musical, was heavily based on his personal experiences growing up in Washington Heights, a neighborhood in NYC that has a heavy percentage of black and hispanic residents.

For another perspective, Oskar Eustis, the artistic director for The Public Theater (where Hamilton made its off-Broadway debut) compares LMM to Shakespeare in one element: ""Lin in Hamilton does what Shakespeare does in his history plays. He is taking the voice of the common people, elevating it to poetry -- in Shakespeare's case, iambic pentameter; in Lin's case, rap, rhyme, hip-hop, R&B -- and by elevating it to poetry, ennobling the people themselves. It's bringing out what is noble about the common tongue."" (Quote taken from PBS's ""Hamilton's America,"" a documentary on the making of Hamilton that they aired a few years back.)",hkm7e5

Furthermore, we’re somewhat comparing the play to the standards set after the George Floyd protests given the timing of the release date. This was recorded in 2016 and presumably written well before that. We’ve made a lot of progress on racial awareness in the past month. So I give him a break on that. 

On the haunting of Lin Manuel Miranda, Ishmael says he hasn’t even watched the play. That struck me as odd to critique something you haven’t seen. 

It broke barriers, and maybe it didn’t go far enough, and I think Miranda has taken a lot of the criticisms to heart and surely whatever he makes next, if it’s historical, will include appropriate acknowledgment of the travesties of the time period.

But that aside

> The popularity of Hamilton just makes them more popular since statues are mostly irrelevant but a bestselling musical is not

I don't think that's a problem. If we're all going to live in a nation together we have to have some sort of common understanding of who we are as a collective people, what our collective ideals and beliefs are.

Since the dawn of storytelling, that's been through myth, not history. The advantage of myth is it's emotional, it's engaging, it clearly communicates ideas. Myth is important to helping to bind and define a people, and ""origin myths"" are the most common.

Every people has a mythologized origin, you can't find a culture that doesn't. And, importantly, every people redefines, reimagines, and retells that myth differently over time. That's an important part of the evolution of a people, and often you find it hashed out in competing mythologies about the same characters. For most of human history, the idea of spinning a story in history to fit your narrative was not remarkable at all.

Modern concepts of ""History"" are just that, very modern. Like in the past two centuries. And history is definitely important. I don't mean to dismiss or diminish it or the importance of unvarnished truth and facing up to it. But that occurs separate from myth.

Hamilton reimagines the American mythology. It hits a lot of traditional themes of the American mythology, the ""underdogness"", the striving for greatness, the ambition, the...well...the idea that ideas are more powerful than force, and importantly equality, that a poor scrub can rise to be so powerful off sheer ability.

That America has failed, repeatedly, in a lot of ways to live up to that is important told through history. But the ideals themselves are not bad, but good. And retelling them in myth in a way that allows minorities to also participate in this shared conception is important. 

Otherwise we have no national ideals, just the sins of the past. And if that's the case, do we really even have a nation?",hkm7e5

But given the period, women of high status back then did not have a job, their only ‘job’ was to care for their family. Eliza irl was very dedicated to preserve her husband’s legacy. In the show, after Hamilton’s death, she becomes the one controlling the narrative and does everything she can to achieve what her husband would do.

fx381so,"Hi, black person speaking here:

You’re full of shit.

It’s a musical about early America that I think had some very subtle commentary on the political climate of today. If you had pulled the kofi from over your eyes, you would have picked up on just how slimy each of the main characters were portrayed. 

Although, the main criticism leveled at Burr was that he was willing to change his political stance in order to be in “the room where it happens,” this can also be applied to Hamilton as well because he began adapting his arguments to Burr’s strategy. And in terms of policy (historically), he turned his back on the lower class, even though, a few years prior, he had been impoverished as well. This is EXACTLY what politicians do today. They pretend like they advocate for one political stance, but only because it will benefit them and put them in power.

Also, LMM seemed to portray Hamilton as a workaholic narcissist. At least that’s what I picked up on. That’s why when Jefferson, Madison, and Burr confront him of his embezzlement, he thinks he can just “write his way” out of it. LMM explores how Hamilton could have picked up this mentality because of how he “wrote his way” out of the Caribbean at such a young age. I think this is a brilliant synthesis of a character and truly shows LMM’s ability to not only reflect on Hamilton as a character, but as a real person. 

Your claims that Hamilton didn’t grow or grapple with his internal issues just proves you haven’t listened to the soundtrack. That’s MOST of what he does. A good deal of the songs open with Burr repeating Hamilton’s epithet (that he often repeats himself) “How does an [insert insult here], son of a whore . . .” And there are a lot of songs where not only he, but other characters remark on how he overcompensates for his humble beginnings. Angelica, Eliza, Washington . . . [“Look at where you are. Look at where you started.” “. . . he’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants.”] all of these characters bring this up. Did you seriously not listen to the musical at all???

As for the cheering for Washington, I think they cheered for him because he already did have quite a lot of clout with the Broadway crowd before this play. 

That leads me to my next point (not really, this is a shitty segway lol), how is utilizing rap “appropriation” now? I do believe there is such thing as cultural appropriation (to some extent), but if anything Lin paid homage to rap culture. He included quite a few references to hip-hop martyrs like Biggie Smalls with a few lines and even the song “Ten Duel Commandments” which riffs off of the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ten Crack Commandments.” I think the rapping was quite good and imho a hell of lot better than most mainstream rap today. But I guarantee you, the 2 hour Hamilton soundtrack is not outselling the latest hip-hop artist’s album.

Finally, it’s a fucking musical, dude. I don’t know why you expected a historically accurate and detailed account of the founding fathers. If anyone is getting their history from a musical, I fear for their sanity. Of course, they had to cut a lot of things out of, which, is why they didn’t go into Hamilton’s childhood. But unless you were just asleep or something, the first song, “Alexander Hamilton,” does a brief synopsis of Hamilton’s life and how he came to America. 

I said in another comment that we could compare this to Les Miserables, which, can have a lot of the same criticism levied on it, but no one seems to care about that play’s historical inaccuracies. Is it because the cast of Hamilton is mostly black and Hispanic? Is that why you hoteps are coming out of the woodwork to attack it? Because that’s what it seems like. Whenever black people are in a successful production that is universally praised, there are always people like you who will try and spoil it by saying some BS like “this is neoliberalism!!” or something. Why can’t you just support black actors and actresses? You people always seem to only come out to criticize the work of black people, never to praise it. Like, a lot of these POC actors and actresses have gone on to do bigger and better things because of this play. If nothing else, at least be happy about that.

You're right that Broadway is not generally an inclusive place, and its shows largely don't tackle issues that would upset its wealthy white patrons or NYC tourists. But I also think that the show has done a lot of good. It's made a huge difference in casting actors of color, in bringing up conversations about race in media, in its effect on kids, in helping to revitalize an art-form that has been pretty white-centric and closed off for a century. 

No piece of art is perfect, and Hamilton is no exception to that rule. But I also think part of engaging with any sort of text or media is to examine and discuss its faults. All great works of art has nagging flaws or problematic bits. Those bits don't mean we all have to stop engaging with the art altogether,  they just give us a new lens to look through. And I'd love to see a production of Hamilton that addresses the flaws of the text in the staging, like they've been doing with Shakespeare, or Rodgers and Hammerstein, or Sondheim revivals for years. Maybe they can re-instate the 3rd cabinet battle that directly addresses the founding father's hypocrisy when it comes to slavery.",hkm7e5

Lin says that he wrote (and the workshop cast first performed) Stay Alive II and It's Quiet Uptown days later, as expressions of the grief they were all feeling.

Really the only big distributors who could pick it up are Netflix, Amazon, and maybe HBO, but whether that means acquiring the archived OBC recording (if that’s possible, I’m not sure) or filming a whole new version is another hurdle. tldr any Book of Mormon film would be a very hard sell lol",hkm7e5

fx2dgop,"Imo, it just gets a little unfocused and some things that get passed over rather quickly feel like they deserve more time to really land. 

To say it another way, I sort of feel like Act 2 needed to be the length of an entire musical by itself. Like Say No To This feels like a song that belongs in an Act 1 of a musical, imo, as the tragic fall that sets up consequences that will be reaped after intermission. So it's more of a pacing problem that I feel plagues Act 2, nothing really about the content itself. 

I also found some of the moments that the chorus comes in to give commentary to be a bit heavy handed. Like the way they come spell out for the audience ""hey look, Eliza is forgiving him! Do you see this? Forgiveness yay!"" When, to me, showing and not telling would have been better. (The simple act of joining hands, for instance, perhaps accompanied by a [just insanely beautiful musical cue](https://youtu.be/KmTcYiuwYCE) that says it all for you).

But these are all relatively minor nitpicks. I love Room Where It Happens and Your Obedient Servant, for instance. I think Room Where It Happens is probably the song where Miranda is most successful at achieving that balance of metahistorical commentary couched within the perspective of someone in the story. And Obedient Servent is underrated in the way it uses music to perform its discourse.",hkm7e5

A man of many contradictions, the real Hamilton was self-made yet classist, and an immigrant yet supported the Alien and Sedition Acts.

The theme of the show is ""the stories we tell matter"" and this seems like an attempt to write the American Myth in a way that makes it accessible and appreciable to racial minorities. Does it work? For a lot of people, yeah. I admit that I'm confused when i see actual pictures of Burr now because Leslie Odom has replaced him in my mind. But is it a worthwhile attempt? I'm not entirely sure. Hamilton is an attempt at myth-making, not history-telling. It's more similar to Hadestown than to the historical fiction of, say, Les Mis. The Myth is that the founders of America were heroes who stove for equality (flaws and all). The Truth is a lot worse: George Washington had teeth ripped out of his slaves' mouths for his own personal use. So should we embrace the myth that Hamilton presents, and try to focus on the positives of our own history? I don't know. I don't really think so.",hkm7e5

The real indictment against Washington was simply that he bought wholeheartedly into the system, managing an organization of up to 200 slaves, and employing all the standard methods of control and coercion to force them to work for him. He thought of himself as their patriarch and considered it ingratitude when they didn't respond in kind. He wasn't a bad slave-owner for the standards of the time, but he wasn't a good person in that context, either. 

Had he examined his beliefs in that area as critically as he did in other areas like politics, he could have realized the wrong he was doing--others in his time did--so he deserves to be criticized for it.

But I think it was a good insight into one of the most brilliant minds to come from that generation. He was shred, he was prolific, and he was heroic.

My hope is that we can form a national culture in the coming years where we can give credit for the good that people did while accepting the sins that they committed.

fwxxji9,"As someone else mentioned, that is *absolutely* the goal here, and this sort of thing is why so many people have very seriously and unironically compared this play to Shakespeare.

When Shakespeare was writing his plays, they weren't being written as high art.  They were written in a way that elevated the language of the common folk through poetry while also clowning in a way that appealed to mass audiences, and delivering enough substance to draw the attention of the cultured upper crust of society.  In order to do this, he played off of the existing culture around him.  His plays contain all sorts of references, some more serious and some more tongue-in-cheek, that killed in the Elizabethan era but that we as modern audiences don't pick up on because we don't come from the same culture the plays are referencing (which is why most of us need to read Shakespeare with footnotes).  A lot of people forget or never realized that Shakespeare wrote many plays maintaining this style and approach while [telling a fictionalized story about actual English history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_history#List_of_Shakespeare's_histories)

Hamilton honest to god does a very similar thing to Shakespeare's histories on a technical level.  It's not written to be high art--it's written in a musical style that is not considered particularly prestigious and is not associated with the type of cultural elitism that we associate with ""high art.""  And it very much plays off of the culture around it.  [One look at the annotated lyrics to the show on Genius](https://genius.com/Original-broadway-cast-of-hamilton-alexander-hamilton-lyrics) almost reads like a footnoted version of Hamlet.  There are still some [double- and triple- meanings to some of the lyrics](https://genius.com/8051946) that I'd never thought of before despite listening to the thing upwards of 20 times by now.  People who approach the show from a musical theater background can find all sorts of little references, both musical and lyrical, to other Broadway shows, and ditto for people approaching it from more of a hip hop or rap background.  People coming in from the history side of things will also find all sorts of smart little things that were done (despite the liberties taken) to communicate certain historical realities (like the fact that there are no preserved letters from Eliza to Hamilton post- Reynolds Pamphlet), and to artistically craft one of the main themes of the show to be about how history works.  It's a work that is very much meant to reflect the culture it's steeped in--Lin let every influence just flow right through, even some [relatively obscure ones.](https://genius.com/7865155)",hkm7e5

fx4pes8,"Thank you for taking the time to write your response, and thank you especially for the brief history lesson. I'm not particularly familiar with American history, so the added context is especially appreciated. I do acknowledge that my enjoyment of the play was probably hindered by my ignorance, and try not to factor that in too much to my criticism of the production. 

I think it's fair to support a work of fiction attempting to encourage its audience to learn more, as I have via reading discussions on Reddit and elsewhere. One of my initial thoughts was that the play's narrative and message couldn't be internalized as well because they come from an unreliable narrative - or at least, unreliable-ish because it is a piece of historical fiction rather than pure history - but that's largely a result of my lack of knowledge rather than vice-versa. I can't fault the play for that. It's up to me to fill in the holes, not to unfairly expect a piece of entertainment to. 

However, I tend to disagree with your analysis to a degree. I personally don't think the play side-stepped the slavery aspect effectively. In my opinion, by twisting some of the mentions of such a difficult topic into a snide and clever remark Hamilton is actually fumbling that discussion a fair bit. Again, I'm not sure how I would expect a piece of entertainment to handle that gracefully, but the way that Jefferson is put down by Hamilton's sly look back and mic drop moment to the audience felt like a strong negative depiction to me. I hone in on that moment so much because it feels like an obvious glaring example of the...disrespect? hamfistedness? convenience? that Hamilton the play approaches slavery with. I suppose I just had higher expectations for how a nuanced and extensive topic like slavery would work into the play, rather than being reduced to what was essentially a lyrical punchline on more than one occasion. 

I had completely overlooked the production's omission of the historical treatment of Native Americans. Thank you for the reminder, as that kind of illustrates my point. I feel like Hamilton's omission is actually more effective of a sidestep than how it chose to address slavery. Whether it was an intentional decision or not, I feel like there is a somewhat reasonable argument to be made that omitting the topic is preferable to treating it poorly. But I'm also an ignorant white dude sharing my personal response to a production, so I don't really want to cross the line into analyzing historical and contemporary portrayals. I just know that it left a bad taste in my mouth, which I think is reasonable.",hkm7e5

Ultimately, both were complicated personalities in a very young nation that was still trying to find its way.

I do agree, in spirit, what you said in regards to the historical background behind the inception and the popularity of the musical that it is very much a product of its time (LMM debuted the Alexander Hamilton opener song in a 2009 White House cultural event with Barack Obama in attendance, and the musical was released in broadway in 2015 - Obama’s 7th year in office), and as I said it before, the entire cancel Hamilton movement is pointless to me, not to mention that in numerous interviews LMM and crew did acknowledge criticisms regarding Hamilton’s historical licenses. Instead of canceling this one musical due to its popularity for its “questionable history” in very current context, I hope broadway at large and LMM (And to a larger extent, the American entertainment and cultural establishment apparatus) would embrace materials that would be more critical and reflective of the unequal status quo.",hkm7e5

This is totally understandable when the show is trying to condense almost 30 years of plot into two and a half hours, but I can definitely understand why some people have brushed up against the simplification of Hamilton's relationship with slavery.

Edit: for those who are unfamiliar: 

>Like many powerful families, the Schuylers maintained a household staff of enslaved Africans. Slavery was outlawed in New York in 1799, but until then, Hamilton conducted transactions involving slaves on behalf of his extended family.

>There are three separate financial records of Hamilton buying slaves for his own household. A 1784 cash book for a client reads ""To a negro wench Peggy sold him."" A 1796 cash book similarly records $250 paid to one N. Low for ""2 Negro servants purchased by him for me."" Finally, a 1797 ledger records the purchase of a ""negro woman & child"" from a Dr. John B Church for $225 and, a few weeks later, the purchase of another African woman for $90.

If anything that is my complaint with the show. It is an amazing musical by all accounts, but when it comes to being historically accurate maybe we shouldn't be so focused on making Burr seem like such a great guy. After he failed to seize power through the presidency, he turned to treason.

It’s usually the later half of a year where we really begin to see a larger quantity of great movies find their releases. So I think it’s way to early to judge 2020 as good or bad. We’ve yet to see the films that would be making the festival rounds and the Oscar contenders. That being said, a year that’s seen releases like Never Rarely Always Sometimes, Sorry We Missed You, Emma, Onward, Tommaso, Da 5 Bloods, Wendy, Spaceship Earth, Crip Camp, Bad Education, First Cow, Bacurau, Vitalina Varela, Family Romance LLC, Deerskin, A White White Day, Beanpole, Blow the Man Down among others already I would count as a great start. Then we have new films by David Fincher, Wes Anderson, Charlie Kaufman, Kogonada, Mia Hansen-Love, Mike Mills, Thomas Vinterberg, Denis Villeneuve, David Lowery, Apichatpong Weerasethakhul, Paul Greengrass, Christopher Nolan, Chloe Zhao, Sofia Coppola, Tsai Ming-liang, Miguel Gomes, Pete Docter, Joanna Hogg, Tom McCarthy, Jia Zhangke, Francois Ozon, Aaron Sorkin, Christian Petzold, Steve McQueen, Steven Spielberg among many others set for this year.

What we know about Hamilton's duel is that his shot went high and struck a tree branch above Burr's head. he did NOT point his pistol straight in the air and fire. Under the rules of engagement, if he intended to waste his shot, he would have simply handed the gun back to his 'second' and took no shot at all.

He aimed, asked for his glasses, aimed again, and fired in the direction of Burr's head. The bullet missed. Everything else is speculation.",hkm7e5

fy89n1u,"Yes, it has a good story, but the structure is not suited to film at all, for a variety of reasons. Part of what makes the play work so well is how it flows through time so smoothly and never feels like a historical epic in terms of scope. Other than Philip (and even then not really), nobody seems to age. If the years weren't mentioned every few songs and you had no knowledge of American history, you would probably think the show takes place over the course of a few months, not several decades. The writing of the show even uses this to it's advantage. For example, during the final duel when Burr says ""this man will not make an orphan of my daughter"", absolutely no one in the audience is thinking about the fact that Theodosia Burr is now in her twenties and married, because Dear Theodosia doesn't feel like it happened twenty years ago. This is perfectly fine on stage but it would not work at all in a film that's grounded in realism. It's the same thing with all the fourth wall breaks, abstract movement (i.e. ""the bullet""), double casting, and casting adults as children/teenagers: it works on stage but not on film. Any good film adaptation of Hamilton would either have to be a very loose adaptation (which would upset the incredibly large fanbase) or be as abstract and theatrical as the play is (and at that point, why don't you just watch the filmed play).",hkm7e5
fx4idog,"Yeah my only problem with the show was that it completely reversed Hamilton and Jefferson's personalities. Hamilton was way more outspoken and boisterous than Jefferson, and Jefferson was very progressive for his time in terms of civil rights compared to Hamilton.

He was working within what he had witnessed and understood from his time prior to that, which was that a strong hand was needed, and that frequent changes of power were dangerous. And let’s not pretend that four year terms don’t have downsides; he was making a good faith argument in an open forum, and was perfectly willing to compromise on it. Unlike most of the wealthy and aristocratic delegates he was a man of the people, and understood the danger of a mob.

I also think there is a distinction between an authoritarian and someone who wants a strong government, even if that distinction is harder to parse in the discourse of 1790–1800. Remember that aside from occasional city-states, the idea of a Liberal Democracy did not exist.

I will definitely give that he worked hard to accumulate power, but he worked within the system laid out in the Constitution he helped author. He also *used* that power effectively, honestly, and most of all *publicly*. Actual Aaron Burr never seemed to want to do anything but accumulate it. I think Chernow’s assertion that Washington and Hamilton amplified each other’s positive traits and attenuated the negative is correct, but we’ve only got Hamilton’s actual life to go by, and it was both extraordinary and honorable.

Jefferson gave us a national identity, Washington a facade—not in any derogatory way, he defined how a leader could be expected to behave, and Madison a rulebook, but Hamilton gave us infrastructure, and an honest-to-God boring *government*. Every technocrat we’ve ever had since has been, in one way or another, his descendant.",hkm7e5

fwtxcqh,"""For Good"" I admit is one I do think about occasionally. And I don't mean to say that these songs are *bad.* But I do think that second acts in musicals are often less memorable musically than first acts. For a couple of reasons. 

1.) There are often fewer songs in the second act than the first (Wicked, for instance, has 11 songs in Act 1 and 8 in Act 2). 

2.) Act 2 often relies on the reprise of songs first heard in Act 1.

3.) In big historical epic musicals, I often find that the second half plot wise often feels less tight. Like Hamilton Act 1 takes place between 1776 and the early 1780s, and retells one of America's most well-known foundational myths, while Act 2 explores some lesser-known stories and covers a wider historical period between Jefferson's return from France in 1789 and Hamilton's death in 1804.

I guess what I'm saying is that the structure of musicals is very often organized around a huge climactic musical event at the end of Act 1, which often becomes the most iconic and well-known moment of the whole show. That makes total sense given the way musicals are structured with an intermission in the middle. But I do think it makes it tough to sustain the plot's energy in the second act.",hkm7e5

for me, the multicultural cast wasn't remotely the most interesting thing to me - it was the fact that this play made palatable and realistic dry shit in history books that seemed so ancient to me 40 years ago, which now in middle age seems to suddenly be living and breathing.  i spent three hours after watching this last night reading the history of the founders (as men and humans) and their families and their grandchildren and great grandchildren, and was delighted to see that the dueling grounds can still be mapped even today.  this is shit that i had absolutely no interest in two days ago.

for me, it wasn't about ""oh hey, here's the founders being represented by black dudes.""  it was about suddenly really understanding, ""these were human beings with a story beyond the dry boring shit i was 'taught' in fifth grade, who had a vision for a country they were creating.'

i guess it could be said that i'm simplistic that i needed a hiphop soundtrack to finally develop an interest in the founders, but my larger point here is that if you're boiling it down to a multicultural cast, you might be the one missing the point.

As far as Hamilton, he was anti-slavery and never personally owned slaves himself, but even the first song states that it was in the society around him - ""And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away across the waves..."" He grew up in Nevis in the Caribbean, which would have been a stopping point for ships carrying slaves.",hkm7e5

I doubt you really care why they cast the people they did; we can only go by [what Lin-Manuel Miranda has said](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/07/hamilton-cast-casting-directors-diversity-1234571127/), namely that ethnicity wasn't specified for the actors. 

The resulting show is a statement, in a sense, that the race of the actor has no bearing on the character when we know what George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, etc. look like while literally every other TV show, movie, or theater production just cast white people for lead roles where race has no bearing.",hkm7e5
fx57hvm,"Lin’s the creator of the show and had the most passion for the project so he wanted to play Hamilton himself. He’s not the best quality performer I’ll admit.

A lot of your issues seem to stem from the fact that this is not just a “hip-hop musical” and instead has a diverse assortment of song types. Why would Soo’s voice take you out of the play? Did her beatboxing also take you out of the play? It’s a musical, which you already stated you weren’t a fan of.

You say you liked Burr as the second best performer but he has even less hip-hop elements than Hamilton or Angelica, yet the lack of hip-hop was your main detractors for characters like Washington and Eliza.

And as for the source material being “too dry,” it’s the American Revolution! The first act is about the war and Hamilton getting married whereas the second act is about Hamilton’s affair, conflicts with Jefferson, and his death by duel.

fwx3ebt,"I mean, there are a shitton of Broadway references as well, and the writing decisions that LMM made play into the narrative a shitton. Some of the things that I can think of from the first song alone:  
-The show opens with Aaron Burr, the villain. This is a shout to Andrew Lloyd Weber's technique.  
-In the first few lines, consider the triple entendre of the word ""providence.""  
-Out of all the Founding Fathers, I'd argue (as would a lot of people, particularly people of color) that Jefferson has the worst reputation when it comes to slavery. See: Sally Hemmings. The first words we get from Jefferson are, ""And every day while slaves were being slaughtered...""  
-Hamilton introduces himself with, ""My name is Alexander Hamilton,"" a trope that is as old as rap itself.  
-Hamilton says, ""Just you wait."" Yeah, he's talking to the audience and telling them to wait as exposition is happening, but who else could he be talking to? Perhaps the guy who opened the song, the guy whose whole shtick is to ""Wait For It""?  
-The few lines where we get introduced to New York blend Bernstein's ""New York, New York"", Sinatra's ""New York, New York"", and Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind"".  
-While the concept of becoming a new person in New York appears in lots of different things, the term ""new man"" is specifically used. This is a reference to the Romans where being a ""new man"" meant you were the first from your family to enter public office. It's a reference to how much the Founding Fathers looked to the Romans for guidance when the country was new--a la 'e pluribus unum.'  
-""We are waiting in the wings for you"" - 1) The other actors are literally waiting in the wings of the stage. 2) The American people are waiting in the wings for Hamilton to shake a bunch of shit up. 3) The West Wing. 4) Jay-Z's line, ""Bird-ass n----s, I don't mean to ruffle yall / I know you waitin in the wings, but I'm doin my thing.""  
-There are quite a few references to waiting and time and whatnot throughout the first song, which is one of the motifs of the show. While this may not be an overture in form, it definitely is in function--which, if you want to read too much into it, compares the impact of melody in most musicals to the impact of lyrics in this musical.  
-""Another immigrant comin up from the bottom"" - Hamilton would have been coming from a low socio-economic status, but don't forget that he's presumably emerging from the ship at this point in the song. He would have ridden in steerage and literally be coming up from the bottom of the ship.  
-The actors who play Lafayette/Jefferson and Hercules Mulligan/Madison say, ""We fought with him."" Lafayette and Mulligan fought with Hamilton in that they fought by his side. Jefferson and Madison fought with Hamilton in that they fought against him in Congress. Laurens/Philip also says, ""I died for him."" Both of those characters end up dying.  
-My ear is not good enough to say this for sure, but I'm fairly certain that the piano motif that runs throughout the first act draws from ""Shook Ones Pt. II"" by Mobb Deep.

edit: In Jefferson's quatrain, literally every syllable has at least one alliteration, assonance, or dissonance link. *Maybe* you could argue that the ""row"" in borrow doesn't, in the most hair-splitting of technicalities, qualify as dissonance, but even then, it's part of some really good cacophony.",hkm7e5

So does Hamilton meet those criteria? It's a recording of events that were not created specifically for the screen, but you could say the same of a documentary. And it's an entirely unique film experience. It is not identical to the stage show by virtue of the director choosing which parts of the action to focus on.

So why discuss it on /r/movies? For the same reasons we discuss anything here. It was marketed heavily for a wide audience and people want to discuss it. You can't say the same for Shrek the Musical.

He just never really does anything selfless.  

I love the way I listened to ""Wait For It"" and it's so sympathetic, and his insecurity watching Hamilton rise through the ranks kind of feels justified, but at the same time Hamilton's accusations at the end of the play are entirely correct: Burr never really looks out for anyone but himself and his daughter the entire play.",hkm7e5
fx0z39y,"Neither Hamilton and Burr were the greatest of guys. I don't think the musical painted Burr as being better than Hamilton; it just asked us to empathize with both of them. Burr simply had the narrator treatment that guided the audience through the years. 

I wouldn't say Burr was MEANT to steal the show, except in the sense that Lin knew he was casting himself as Hamilton, and that he wasn't the strongest singer, so Burr/Eliza/Angelica/Lafayette/Washington etc. would have to do more heavy lifting.",hkm7e5

fwuc9xr,"All of those lines near the end of the first song from the supporting cast work in tandem with the double roles:
- Layfayette and Hercules Mulligan fought alongside Hamilton in the war, hence the “we fought with him”
- In act II, theyre Jefferson and Madison, who butted heads with him, so “we fought with him” takes on a double meaning
- Laurens and Phillip, who both die in the story and played by the same actor gets “me, I died for him”
- The three main women say “me, I loved him”, as Angelica and Eliza both loved him, but Peggy’s actress is also there as she also plays Maria Reynolds, hence another “love”

I'd have loved the show if it was an all white cast with music like it was out of Legally Blonde.....but I definitely wouldn't have found it to be particularly powerful.  That element of taking the founders and figureheads of a nation literally built on slavery and casting black and brown people in their place really stands out.  And I can't exactly articulate why, but I guess it seems almost like a sweet revenge or even just, like I said, a ""reverse whitewashing"", especially in the historical learning aspect.  In American schools, we don't learn much about slavery, we don't learn much about Japanese internment.  We aren't even told about Mexican Repatriation and the Trail of Tears is completely glossed over.  So the very mythology of America is built not only around a white image, but almost to reinforce America as a white country.  What minorities were ever here are either forgotten entirely or had their oppression ignored by the history books.

So then you take these mythological figures of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, etc., and have them played by black and brown people and that's just....well, it's something.  Either a fuck you to white supremacy or maybe more of a celebration of triumphing over it (at least to some degree) or maybe it's simply representation and rewriting America as multicultural.  Or a combination or something else entirely.  That's the point I haven't quite figured, but there's something there whether intended or not that gives this greater meaning beyond just being a fun way to learn about Hamilton (especially considering it's a bit loose with the historical facts anyway).

So I do think that the ethnicity of the cast had an impact on the show itself, and that's what I'd like to articulate, but I haven't nailed it down yet.  

It's not as powerful if you have a bunch of white guys playing the Founding Fathers, like we've seen over and over again.  I disagree with the idea that the statement is race of the actor doesn't matter since it clearly would not be the same show or the same impact with an all white cast.",hkm7e5

 I enjoyed Odom's performance, but didn't particularly care for the music. I didn't particularly care for any of the music, really. It was a little too all over the place.

When you think about it, there are no sung numbers for like the last third of movies like Lion King (after Can You Feel the Love Tonight) or basically half of Mulan (after A Girl Worth Fighting For). And a lot of the most forgettable songs in movies like Beauty and the Beast (the Mob Song), Frozen (He's a Bit of a Fixer Upper), and so on are shoved into the later parts of the movies too. But it's mostly fine, because by that point, you are invested in the plot. 

But I can totally understand why Broadway finds that ""first half = music, second half = plot"" structure a bit restrictive. It does kind of go against the very premise of musicals to not have your most climactic narrative moments occur alongside your best musical numbers.

Similar to Thomas Jefferson, he spoke out against the institution of slavery on occasion while still actively participating in it.

With Thomas Jefferson, his atrocities are pretty much entirely glossed over, despite him being one of the main antagonists. The only mention of the child slave he repeatedly raped is a coy joke during What’d I Miss.

>And if he wanted to get it to the widest audience demographic possible he could have written it less adult in the first place. I love Lin but this is him having his cake and eating it too.

Again though this all goes to imply that the show should've been constructed entirely for a more family friendly demographic that Lin didn't even know he was going to be catering towards when he wrote the songs 10 years ago. A broadway show isn't constructed for the soul purpose of catering towards a television rating system, and Lin isn't some psychic who could see just how popular Hamilton was going to become, inevitably leading to the filming of it's stage production and release on television. 

But that doesn't mean censoring one liners later on down the line is wrong either. Because if the purpose with this recording was to further the shows reach amongst audiences then censorship absolutely works as a bridge to get it on as many screens possible. You say Lin can't have his cake and eat it too, but you can't really say that unless this recording bombs solely because of the censorship.
