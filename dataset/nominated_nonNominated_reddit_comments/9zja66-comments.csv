ea9vm2k,"Melissa gives easily the best performance of her career, one that is absolutely worthy of an Oscar nomination, maybe more than just that.  But Richard E Grant stole every scene and if he isn’t nominated for Supporting Actor I will fucking riot.",9zja66
eaa5s1z,The film is unbelievably good. Such a fantastic surprise. Also features a great Paul Simon song - Can’t Run But,9zja66
ea9vuxg,"I was so surprised by this movie. It's not so much a biopic as a deeply empathetic look at loneliness. This is easily Melissa's best performance which is too bad because she's blown out of the water by Richard E. Grant. He nailed a certain kind of gay man that died off during the AIDS crisis. He was so lively yet such a tragic figure who wouldn't let that define him. And just in general it was perfect at representing the struggles of being older and queer and feeling the community leave you behind.

Also it was so interesting how Lee was the architect of her own destruction. That scene at the end of the date where Anna goes in for a kiss and she refuses her is so tragic. She knows she damages people but she can't help wanting to feel love. What a brutal character moment in a single scene. ",9zja66
eaa2jwh,"Richard Grant was the best part of this movie, not that Melissa McCarthy wasn't amazing as well.",9zja66
eah7oeq,"I absolutely loved this film! For me, 2018 has been a highly disappointing year for movies (but I shouldn't complain, since 2017 was my personal favorite year in film). I have to say, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is my favorite film of the year. I really wanted to cry when Lee's cat died. Melissa is terrific, and I loved her friendship with Jack. Lovely cinematography and some comedy thrown in. Great film!!!",9zja66
eazgqc8,"This was a good movie, I really liked it. Mccarthy and Grant are amazing!! The scene where she finds the cat almost made me cry. ",9zja66
eaa03hr,"Both Grant and McCarthy have great chances of being nominated at the Oscars but especially at the globes. Best performance of McCarthy career and I'm not a big fan of her but I loved her performance. 

The whole cat part of the film made me sad :(.",9zja66
effl2zz,"I'm not even all the way through but had to pause to tell someone how much I love this movie already.

The script really hits the spot, the acting is flawless, no masterful. I'm not quite feeling the pacing so far, but that's not all too much of an important thing to me anyway.

The characters, and their relationships are magic. Really authentic. Almost as if I'd been there myself.

&#x200B;

Kudos to everyone who made this such a special movie.",9zja66
ef343hw,"Found this movie to be delightful! Reminded me of an old woody allen movie, and the writing of Holofcener was evident throughout.

Heller’s direction was wonderful here and she kept the pacing of the movie moving quite nicely.

McCarthy was fantastic, as was Grant. He might be my favorite for supporting actor. Both Oscar noms were much deserved!",9zja66
egu3lmr,Holy shit that last scene between Grant and McCarthy. Grant in that scene. You can see the battle between his life’s charade and his current illness right in his eyes. What an enjoyable movie. The more I think about it the more I enjoyed it.,9zja66
eaa5wk1,"I kept hearing how this was Melissa McCarthy's serious role, but I also thought the movie was very funny and witty.

I wasn't paying attention when she said the cat feeding directions. They focused on the cat food, did Jack follow the instructions Lee gave him? ",9zja66
ebw9e7w,That dinner scene between Lee and Anna really struck a chord with me. Can’t really explain why but it did.,9zja66
eilhyxv,"The scene that made me happiest in this movie was when she kicked her friend out of the apartment after she was told it smelled really bad and he still knocked on the door and offered to help clean up and that he didn't mind. It was very.....I don't l know, it just made me happy.",9zja66
eaiqeiu,"Anyone knows name of the song sang by cross-dresser singer at the bar?

Great Movie, BTW, capture the lonely mood really well.",9zja66
ea9xsjc,"This was decent. I could easily see Grant & McCarthy nab up a bunch of nominations (and maybe even a Golden Globe win or two). 

If anything, this is a reallllly good sign for the Mr. Rogers biopic with Tom Hanks next year. Marielle Heller's got insane potential.",9zja66
eh55g7j,"I loved this. McCarthy's performance was incredible, as was Grant's. The writing was great, too. Just delightful. ",9zja66
eabfczq,"I've been wanting to see this, but our arthouse theater just got rid of it.  Damn! ",9zja66
eja866d,"That scene where she holds her dead can is fucking devastating. 

The loneliness in this film is so palpable from the first five minutes, when she gets fired",9zja66
eja84dn,"I would have liked to know more about Jack Hock - where he lived, his life, how he knew Israel...he's sympathetic and enjoyable thanks to Grant but he's also difficult to like b/c we know he gives Lee away and is at least somewhat responsible for her death. 

I haven't read the book but I suspect he was even worse than Hock in the film, and much less charming than Grant. (Anyone who read the memoir know otherwise?)",9zja66
ehaqp9p,"What did Grant mean when he said ""teeth are dead giveaway"" after he got his bleached? ",9zja66
eazgoi4,"Yeah this was the best acting I have seen from her, when she finds the cat awww. ",9zja66
ehoyjdv,"I cried at this scene! ""Will you make me 29..."" ",9zja66
eaat3bs,"He did. He broke every other rule, but he remembered to break up the pills in the food. ",9zja66
effkxvi,"im with you here..  
the dialogue was spot on. i mean it was so authentic. im still confused if they were into each other or not and i felt all the insecurity and the questions and the what ifs and all that. amazing.",9zja66
eakppka,"Goodnight, Ladies. Originally by Lou Reed.",9zja66
eaa0g65,"She's also married to Jorma Taccone, she's got to have a sense of humour. ",9zja66
eigwumc,I think it was to hide the fact that he was poor and homeless. ,9zja66
eksxfor,I wondered if it might have to do with being HIV positive.,9zja66
eh51kot,"Having lost a cat and finding him in hiding in a similar way, I can totally verify her reaction. Damn fine performance, way better than I expected, going into this movie completely blind.",9zja66
ehqsjw6,I also shed a few manly tears at this point. And many for the next several minutes. ,9zja66
eaawrmt,"Aww, I had to go home and hug the cats afterwards. ",9zja66
ehvp70x,"I felt so hard for Anna. She seemed so sweet. Obviously we know why Lee turned her down, but Anna just looked so hurt and confused after the dinner. ",9zja66
eao2t2b,Thanks!,9zja66
efhd9oy,"Not to quibble but she’s married to Ben Falcone. Who is still a funny guy, makes an appearance in most of her movies. He was the book dealer that bribed her for the $5 grand. ",9zja66
eh56lzp,"Yeah that was sad, im sorry to hear about your cat. ",9zja66
efhi550,"I was referring to Marielle Heller, which I think was pretty clear in the comment. Also, Ben Falcone is one of the least deserving hacks of a director working in big budget comedy right now. He has yet to make an even decent movie but is given 10 million dollar budgets time and time again just cause of McCarthy being his wife.",9zja66
efhi6ut,The comment above is saying the director is married to Jorma. But you are correct that Melissa McCarthy is married to Ben Falcone - just not what they were talking about ,9zja66
efhpm4x," Ha! My reading comprehension is terrible! Thank you! Their names rhyme, can I get credit for that? I downvoted my own post, but won't delete it cause I deserve the downvotes.",9zja66
