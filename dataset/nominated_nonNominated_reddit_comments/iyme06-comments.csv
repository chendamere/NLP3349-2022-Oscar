g6e9b9q,"Liked it. It was a fun film, nothing out of this world but really entertaining. Can see it being turned into a minor franchise. 

My only pet peeve is that, in the Enola universe, despite being 1822, Holmes apparently doesn't have a Watson.

Edit: OK I got the year wrong. The intention remains correct. The money occurs cannonically after Holmes meets Watson in Study in Scarlet which was 1881.",iyme06

Fine family movie, or date night movie. nothing out of this world.",iyme06
g6dr9iz,"Wait so was her mom a straight up domestic terrorist? I was so confused by that subplot.

Enjoyed the movie overall. Fun and endearing and very pretty to look at. Something light and entertaining given the seemingly chaotic times we live in.

Had some headscratcher or half-hearted plot points (like how Sherlock deduced the Dowager was behind everything), but overall recommend.",iyme06
g6do5yz,"I was surprised how much I liked the movie.

Very cute family movie.

Enola was a kick.  Intelligent, determined with a strong sense of perseverance.    As intelligent as she was, you could tell she was still not worldly.   She never gave a thought to the Landlady hoodwinking her for the money (convincing Enola her hole in the wall was decent lodging for London) or turning Enola in for the reward money.    I thought it was nice how she was going to open herself up to building a life at the end.  She seemed to stop using ""Enola is Alone spelled backwards"" as an anthem.   That she realizes, even though she's on her own doesn't mean she has to always be alone was a nice message.   Hope to see she and Sherlock eventually bond.

Sherlock, I liked HC's interpretation of the character.  We rarely see him so gentile and I thought that made an interesting version.   It was easy to tell Sherlock's default setting is detached but that he wanted to connect to Enola and felt for her not knowing why their mother left without her.  He isn't use to being overly concerned with anyone other than himself but he was genuinely trying with Enola

Mycroft was a little one-note but under his icey demeanor, I believe he cares about his siblings, while simultaneously being jealous of both.

Tewksbury was a nice counter to Enola.  He was more worldly/savy in some ways and proved to be resourceful in his own right.   By the end of the film I had no issue believing he would be so attached to Enola.

GrandMother Tewksbury - I didn't see coming.   What a truly dark character hidden beneath a benign surface.   What she was willing to do to her own family just to keep the status quo was shockingly sinister, considering this is a kids movie.

Eudoria Holmes - Mixed feelings about the kind of person she is.  I don't doubt she loves Enola, but she did abandon her, without explanation.  As intelligent and capable as her daughter is, she still has a lot to learn.

I hope they make a sequel.",iyme06
g6lafem,"Anyone else hoped Tewkesbury would be wearing a corset when he got shot at the end?

Bit disappointing that the only major mystery the audience had to work out was ""who wants to kill Tewkesbury?"" Which Enola has more or less told us about halfway through. Then you find out who did and its one random character whose been on screen about two minutes, with the only clue we get being ""it couldn't be the uncle"".

Also, can I point out how ridiculous that plan was? You're gonna murder two members of your family just to get one vote in your favour in the House of Lords, which you somehow magically know will be decisive?

Maybe I'm overanalysing a kids' movie

Also found it pretty corny how they made Mycroft such an over-the-top complete bellend, is he like that in original stories?",iyme06

gauw3tf,"Late to the party, watching it as we speak.

I like it enough, and I'm enjoying Millie Brown's performance; glad to see she's more than just ""Eleven"". She's kinda funny and decently talented, looking forward to see what else she can do.

I found the scene with Edith (the judo instructor) and Sherlock to be really jarring though. She was really offensive and venemous, laying into Sherlock / calling him names and telling him he's effectively a horrible person because he's not into politics...? Felt weird and almost shoehorned.

The rest, I enjoyed.",iyme06

Here, hes just plain unlikeable",iyme06
g6h7i3i,"i enjoyed the movie and hope they make a sequel.
few things i liked:
- the way they included scenes of the past as Enola is narrating/explaining something. it felt like it made sense in this movie and it was more natural than other movies ive seen it in.. plus i like the animated parts of it
- when Tewkesbury grandmother tells Enola she’s been given „a part of England“ to protect which ties really nicely with the (detective?) saying he works „for England“ right before he dies. think the actor delivered that line perfectly
- the fact that flowers are leads for Enola to find both her mom and Tewkesbury

i loved the character of Tewkesbury but when i saw my mom reacting to his grandmother shooting him i kinda wish it the character had actually died because it would mean much more somehow? it was like the scene where Enola gets stabbed but not really",iyme06
g6oun0w,"I thought it was delightful. Enola is spunky, intelligent, charming, relatable, and overall someone who I would have looked up to as a kid. Thoughts:

\-Maybe I have too much faith in the modern audience but I cannot stand the amount of explanatory flashbacks they stuffed into this movie. It really takes the satisfaction out of a good aha-solved-the-clue moment when they flashback to a scene from 5 minutes ago.

\-Tewkesbury was a refreshing boy love interest - the dude in distress, as it were. He takes on all the qualities of the stereotypical upper-class/princess love interest (pretty, polished, fussy, a love for softer things, cries). More boys like this on screen please.

\- I suppose they're setting up for a sequel, but the ending was very abrupt and Enola's mom didn't really explain herself. We figured out what she was doing through Enola's investigation, but Eudoria herself doesn't actually admit anything at the end, nor do we see what her activist group ends up doing. And she never explains why she disappeared out of the blue instead of just telling her daughter that she had a project to go take care of. And then Enola is just cool with it? Felt weird. 

\--GOOD LORD I did not expect Linthorn (murderous henchman) to go out like that.

Overall, this is a fun character I would like to see more of.",iyme06
g85n92q,"Pretty disappointing and predictable for a mystery movie. All the clue-finding seemed incredibly generic, almost like a kids' show: anagrams, numbers that actually represent letters, more anagrams...

The main character didn't even deduce that the grandma was the true mastermind; she just showed up in front of them. Also, how did she know they would return to the estate so that she'd know to send all the servants out?! Like, who the fuck would guess they'd make such a risky move instead of just hiding away in London again?

It was clearly using the Sherlock Holmes brand as a crutch. There is like nothing about this movie that required Sherlock Holmes be present. The story with the mother didn't even go anywhere.

TLDR: The film was insultingly generic.",iyme06

gin2eu0,"This movie was pretty charming and would be great for children. MBB’s performance is charged with a mischievous energy which makes all the camera-winking fun instead of eye-rolling. I loved Enola’s arc; she strikes out to find her mother, to whom she was overly attached, but learns to be independent while also finding acceptance and validation from her brother and a new friend. 

My favorite moment was when she decided to put the search for her mother on hold to help out Tewksbury. She turns to the camera and contemplates aloud why she feels responsible for Tewksbury and says something to the effect of “My mother would tell me to forget about him; that he’s weak and foolish and none of my business. But he’s on the edge of a cliff without the strength to save himself and I **do ** have the strength.” It is an excellent message — I’d even call it Tolkien-esque.

Now for the bad: there was entirely too much jiu jitsu. Ideally there should have been no jiu jitsu in this movie. What makes Enola a good protagonist is resourcefulness. She should be using her mind to get out of jams. There should have been more moments like early when she jumped off the train just before it reached a bridge to strand her pursuer.

The worst part of the movie was the climax of the Tewksbury story. It’s ridiculous and full of the worst cliches, including a character getting shot in the chest, lying on the ground knocked out seemingly dead, then regaining consciousness immediately after their friend discovers they were wearing bulletproof armor. Give me a break!

Overall I liked this film quite a bit, but it could have been great with some rewrites to cut out the nonsense.",iyme06
g92fww2,"I wish the mother and her reasoning for leaving had been more of the plot than the silly romance with the guy who’s clearly not even half as intelligent as enola.

g6fnln5,Millie reminds me of a young Natalie Portman in this film.,iyme06
g6de0g4,It's pretty good. Not a masterpiece but it's entertaining. All the cast were great too and Henry Cavill is a good Sherlock Holmes. Also really liked Sam Claflin as Minecraft Holmes. 7/10.,iyme06
g6ea0qj,"When I first heard about this movie, I honestly thought it sounded terrible. It going to Netflix only reinforced that opinion, because lets be honest Netflix films aren't exactly known for their quality. But I really like Millie Bobby Brown, and I really like Henry Cavill, so I was always going to watch it for them. And I'm really glad I did, Enola Holmes was way better than it had any right to be.

It's probably not going to win any awards or anything, but it was just a really fun, light-hearted and engaging little adventure movie, and also weirdly enough probably the most just purely entertaining film I've seen all year. Most of it was because of the cast though, Millie Bobby Brown was fantastic in this, Enola was just an extremely charming and likeable character, Brown has so much talent and charisma that I'm now absolutely certain she is going to be a huge star going forward. Henry Cavill surprisingly made a great Sherlock, which I never would have guessed, but he was really suave and cool, which honestly I prefer over the 'creepy eccentric weirdo' portrayals that are so common. The rest of the supporting cast was all equally solid, Tewkesbury's actor in particular was really likeable, and I appreciated that the character wasn't nearly as 'useless' as the other characters made him out to be. And his chemistry with Enola was excellent.

It had some problems, it definitely slowed down a bit in the middle and pretty much everything involving her mother just turned out to be a sequel hook essentially which was really disappointing. But otherwise this ended up being a really pleasant surprise.",iyme06
g6fkkku,"Honestly I quite liked it. All the characters are well-conceived and Millie Bobby Brown is extremely charming and magnetic. Henry Cavill is the first time I’ve ever seen a portrayal of Sherlock where I don’t find myself thinking “well, this guy would be an insufferable twat”. All in all a very entertaining way to pass an afternoon.",iyme06
gezx5zb,"Enola constantly looking at the camera was absolutely cringe. I cant even imagine why they would put that in the movie. 

Enola cries about having to go to boarding school (which she escapes by just climbing out a window anyway, wtf is that whole scene), but doesnt give a shit when she fucking murders someone...

Take out her looking at the camera, take out all the fighting (especially unnecessary Ju Jitsu scene), because they are both nonsense, and this movie is at least 30 minutes shorter and a lot easier to watch. 

This is a movie for teenagers that parents can sit through as well. They dont need fighting and murdering. Just a love affair and a smart young lady.",iyme06
g8353ch,"I was incredibly emotionally invested in the pine cone. When she left the women’s school and was being carried out by Teweksbury, I kept thinking “ok but I hope she took the pinecone with her”. I’m happy it had another cameo towards the end.",iyme06
g6de1i2,"Pretty solid movie overall. It's a bit fun, a bit violent, well acted all around. It was a little all over the place tonally, bouncing between a young protagonist struggling with being a lady to brutally fighting a hitman in the streets, but I appreciated the dip into darkness or else I probably would have been a lot more bored with it. I mean, that dude at the end got straight up blunt force trauama'd to the head.

I'm not a huge fan of movies where the main character is always talking directly to the audience and when she asked us for ideas it was a real Dora the Explorer moment, but considering this is a mystery for presumably a young-ish crowd it didn't bother me too much. I did feel like it wasn't as much of a mystery as I'd hoped. It was definitely there but something like forty minutes into the movie it was feeling a lot more like a YA love story than a mystery.

In the end, though, there was a mystery afoot and obviously lots of themes of women's rights and voting, which is a nice take considering the time period. I think they wasted Cavill as Holmes but despite the solid casting this just wasn't his movie. Millie is a really good actress and I'm glad there's finally some space between her and Stranger Things. I think leading a movie like this with this cast is a big step for her and I'm all for it. I'd give it a 6/10. It's not for me but enjoyable enough I'd probably recommend it.

g6dgyjo,"I enjoyed it a fair bit. Admittedly, I was a bit taken aback by the sudden sex scene between Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin's characters, seems like the sort of thing that would require a bit of set-up. But once I got over my shock I enjoyed that too. Solid film 7/10.",iyme06
g6dppd7,"I enjoyed it. Almost lost me in the middle part but I’m glad I stayed and finished it. 

I’ve seen comments that the movie is sexist against men but I disagree. I think the movie handled that part better than most “girl power” movies tbh. Both men and women were good and bad in the movie, as it is in real life. Lesser movies would have taken the easier route where all women are good and all men are bad. Although, I did not like that Mycroft was portrayed as a snob and an overall bad guy. As for Henry Cavill’s Sherlock, I think they took a page out of Jonny Lee Miller’s version rather than Benedict’s. Not that I’m complaining, I loved *Elementary*. 

What I appreciated most about it was that she was actually taught to fight by her mother, unlike in other movies where women are portrayed to be able to do anything just because they’re women **coughs** Mulan (2020) **coughs**. I think *Enola Holmes’* approach is more inspiring since you need to actually train and make an effort to do great things.

Anyway, solid movie. Not my all-time favorite, but still a good watch.",iyme06
g6e2f70,"I liked the film, but some things stood out.

Mainly, how it started out with a whole ""oh my mom's missing wait gunpowder treason and plot"" scenario but turned into a ""save the Marquess, save the world"" situation. I get that the two were linked but I was hoping for some resolution for that beyond her mom showing up at the end.

Also a few moments that felt a bit too contrived solely for the purpose of moving the plot. Tewkesbury conveniently using flowers to bookmark where he was going? 

And pitting a sixteen year old girl against a armed and experienced assassin? Okay, but for a Holmes movie I'd have liked more outwitting and deduction, less extended hand to hand combat. 

Didn't like how Mycroft was a one-note villain in this one either.

But on the whole I'd say it was a fun and enjoyable film overall as long as I didn't think too deeply into it. Millie Bobby Brown in particular gave a great performance and I'd say she's destined for greater things after this.",iyme06
g6e38cb,"I love how anyone who didn’t like the movie is getting downvoted. It was fairly bland in my opinion. The acting was great but the story itself wasn’t very engaging. I felt there wasn’t enough “detective” work for it to be attached to Sherlock Holmes. Also didn’t care for the 4th wall breaks every 5 minutes. Like any other movie, watch for yourself and base your own opinion. I’d say it was 5/10.",iyme06
g6gwqen,"Pros:

* Millie Bobby Brown is really great in the lead role, especially for someone her age. A character who A) is that eccentric, and B) constantly makes asides to the audience could have easily become an annoying caricature, but she handled it well. 

* Henry Cavill's Sherlock is a refreshing change of pace from the sociopath we so often get. I'm sure by now everyone knows *why* we rarely see a softer side to Holmes, but I'm glad we got to see it here. If there's a sequel I hope he gets more screentime with MBB.

* Enola's journey was pretty well-handled. Like her brothers, she's a little larger than life, but her struggles and successes are balanced enough so that she never feels helpless nor invincible. 

Cons:

* They really glanced over the fact that Eudora was a domestic terrorist, huh? 

* I really hated this version of Mycroft. Where was his intellect? Why was he skinny? He wouldn't have bugged me so much if he was anyone other than Mycroft. 

Random Thoughts: 

* Reference is made to Sherlock being friendless, which implies to me  that he has yet to partner with Watson. And yet Sherlock seems to be something of a celebrity. But Sherlock was only ever famous because Watson writes about their adventures. Maybe there was a reference to Watson that I completely missed.

* This could be a touchy subject, but casting an actor of African and South Asian heritage as Lestrade is just weird. If this movie had been set in modern times like Sherlock or Elementary then I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But in the 19^th century? He just stands out. Say what you will about Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express, but at least they addressed Leslie Odom Jr.'s casting in the movie itself.

* It seemed like a lot of the detection was mostly code breaking and puzzle solving. I would have liked more clues and logical reasoning. 

It's totally inoffensive. MBB does a great job as the lead, it's an easy and breezy watch and there's a scene where Burn Gorman tries to drown a teenager. I think families and little kids will enjoy it and, at the end of the day, that's who this movie is for.",iyme06

g6dhroy,"I really enjoyed the movie, it is like a mix of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes and Dora the Explorer. Especially when quick cuts, the combats, and breaking the 4th wall were in this movie. I know it sounds weird but it works for me. The result is something really energetic for me.",iyme06

g94j3e3,"\[SPOILER\]

Fun, enjoyable, has good messages, but many of the ones framed around feminism is undermined by the fact that only two named men are not shown as some sort of villain with a lack of depth. Mycroft really got the short end of the shaft. The two that was not framed as villains were Sherlock and our boi Tewksbury, Tewksbury is okay, but for the most part he was the damsel in distress equivalent, and Sherlock, he was just scolded by women, and I more so just felt bad for him.  


Before you downvote me to hell, the film has great messages concerning feminism, honestly, I'd be giving the film a Delta if it was on r/changemyview, it made me think about the active enforcement of the system that serves you at the expense of others (Mycroft), and the passive complacency to the system (Sherlock). Yes, it was supposed to just be a fun film, but I really think humanizing Mycroft, would make the message more compelling, that the people reinforcing the patriarchy isn't just some mustache twirling caricature, but an actual person that could be your brother or father, who really does care. Maybe I'd have Mycroft express legitimate sadness or anger that his sister was unable to be raised well (in his world view).  


Idk, it's definitely not as bad as I thought it was when it comes to shoving feminism down people's throats, I've probably just became oversensitive and jaded from saturation of feminism done wrong, and this film really got a bit too close to the line of ""men bad"", just not sure if it crossed it. I do like how they illustrate that corset (femininity) can be empowering when chosen, but painful when forced.",iyme06

The novels are feminist, but not in the pandering way of this movie. There is no love interest, no black female martial arts teacher,  Enola carries a dagger and is as  the name suggests alone most of the time.

Firstly I really loved this movie. Brown (Enola) did an excellent job and I for one want to see more of her. 
The ending though, lost steam. It felt like the writer had more to share but everything needed to be wrapped up.

g7cp7ev,"I really enjoyed the tone of this movie. Fun and clever for the most part, and I do enjoy a trip to 19th century London. 

The whole aspect with the finishing school was odd. It felt like it was supposed to be a far worse place than it was portrayed. The headmistress as well. She hit Enola in the first scene with her, but seemed to immediately regret it (granted, she never apologized.) And once at the school, she did seem to care. And although the other girls laughed at Enola's lack of manners, none of them were mean to her.

It honestly felt like it should have been either ""nice veneer with abuse behind the scenes"" or ""really not as bad as Enola feared, and possibly even useful."" The latter especially would have been interesting if it served as a precursor to her dressing as a lady. Learning fine etiquette and then using that knowledge in her disguises.

But instead, the school was just kind of...average and unremarkable.",iyme06
g8tujbr,"Not my cup of tea, but it's a pretty good film. The cast was phenomenal especially Millie Brown who played Enola Holmes. She did a great job and I sympathize with her character throughout. The chemistry between characters was emotional and heartfelt Enola with her brother Sherlock, Enola with her mother, and Enola with that Tewksbury boy (kinda forgot his name). I think the themes in the film are pretty great: politics of women's rights, some quotes that stick with me ""the future is up to us, try to be excited not disappointed with new experiences."" All the messages are real inspiring!

Now I get that this film is pretty political with women especially during the 1890's but as a guy it gets a bit annoying and kind of sexist with ""all men suck"" message. The film likes to hammer away every chance they get. At one point in the film, an elderly lady straight up says ""men are so useless!"" and pushes the man through the door to get the door open.

Not sure if the pacing/editing is too fast or I'm not as ""bright"" but the plot can get confusing. There were times when I'd be watching and rewind parts because I have no idea what just happened of what, why, or how?

I'm big on action scenes, but the fight scenes were meh in this film to me. Sometimes there were way too many cuts and the moves were more flashy instead of practical: I believe Edith threw Enola with an O goshi but the excess cuts and angle made it difficult to see. Enola did some kind of throw on the bowler hat guy that looked like a pro wrestling move instead of a simple shoulder throw or ippon seoi nage.

There were also some inaccuracies with Japanese Jiujitsu in London of that time period. The film is set in 1884 and Ju Jitsu didn't arrive in England until around 1903. I was gonna say judo would have been closer with it being introduced in 1899. I'd say the best substitute martial art for that time period would be catch wrestling or boxing. Catch wrestling was invented in London out of all places in 1870, it couldn't have been more perfect! Boxing has been around since 1600's so absolutely historically accurate. Eh who cares though, no one will right?

I'm nitpicking at this point but overall, it's a pretty good and interesting film. Not bad!",iyme06

Millie Bobby Brown was fine as the young a spunky Holmes' sister but I found Henry Cavill wasted in the part of Sherlock and the depiction of Mycroft, who is Sherlock's smarter brother, boarding on the offensive to anyone who has read Doyle's stories. I'm not sure how other fans of Arthur Conan Doyle's writing will take this but all I can say is *""I hope the book this was based on was better""* and as the movie hints at further adventure - being that the key mystery behind Enola's anarchist mother is never really addressed - I hope they get better screenwriters for further installments.

g6i3b99,"I thought it was kind of a mess of a movie, to be honest.

Millie Bobby Brown was a bit too energetic for my tastes, at times almost bordering on manic, which kind of felt like an odd tonal mood for the main character in the story (who supposedly was facing some pretty traumatic abandonment issues). Elena Bonham Carter is, well, her. Which is to say I feel I’ve seen this exact same performance of hers on a couple other movies. Henry Cavill was, as someone else put it, adequate. It was an actor playing Sherlock Holmes. Don’t get me wrong, I love the dude, but I just couldn’t buy the performance. Burn Gorman was just uninspiring as “the dragon”. The rest of the cast was fine, nothing special, just fine for their intended roles.

Plotwise, well… there’s my beef. I think I’m ready to move past “here’s another invincible, empowered woman taking on the world and steamrolling her way to success”. I find it hard to relate to characters that are already up to the challenge they are supposed to face right from the get go (female OR male). Don’t get me wrong, Enola faced some hardship in the movie, but for some reason the obstacles she faced seemed more like a moment for her to show off how well prepared she was from the start than a real moment of growth for the character. Finally pulling off the Jujitsu grasshopper move or whatever? Yeah, cool, glad you could.

Is it a mystery movie? Is it a family movie? At times it tries to be too many things at once and ends up meandering quite a bit. Plot resolutions feel off. There are some pretty wild leaps of logic. And the ending feels more like a “well, those are our two hours, better wrap this up somehow”, than a cathartic experience.

I did like the set pieces and the photography. The music choices at some points seemed just weird. I did like the cutout montages in between scenes to accompany exposition.

There.",iyme06
g6fdva7,"Enola Holmes was a fun family film that echoed the struggles of women in early 20th century London in the style of a classic Sherlock Holmes film.

I loved cast. Millie Bobby Brown is a marvel. I think she's going to do great things. This was a starkly different character from Eleven, and she was excellent. She's very personable, which makes the 4th wall breaks work generally well in this film. She inhibits this big personality and you can very easily see the spunk and tenacity she brings to Enola. 

I quite liked Henry Cavill as Sherlock. We didn't see much of him, but I'd be interested in a film where he actually plays the famed detective. Sam Claflin as Mycroft was alright. Mycroft is clearly not supposed to be a well liked character, and Claflin does a good job. He sort of does fit the mold of an early 20th century diplomat in London though. I really liked Helena Bonham Carter as Eudoria. I thought she brought this wonderful craziness to the character, but she could still emit this love for Enola when the film called for it. Overall, I'd say we got the perfect dose of each side character. The film clearly focuses on Enola, and it does it well.

Fourth wall breaking is a bit hit or miss in my opinion. As I stated early, MBB's charisma makes it generally work in this film. They establish early on that she thrives when she's on her own, so the wall breaks feel a bit like she's talking to herself. But the content of her wall breaks are so-so in my opinion. We open the film with ""3 things you should know about me"". It's a fun opening, but it doesn't really feel like 3 things we *need* to know about Enola. The third fact is that she can't really ride bikes, but that fact doesn't return to the film until the very last shot. The conclusion is a bit stiff as well, as most narrated conclusions are. 

What really brought me away from this movie were the puzzles. Generally, the puzzles were all solvable if you paid attention. But it felt like at least two thirds of the puzzles were just word scrambles. There is a decryption puzzle using a codex, but not much else. I will admit that solving the Tewksbury case is fun. All the pieces are given to us throughout the film. It's not an overly complicated puzzle, which doesn't quite make it as interesting as a puzzle we might see in the BBC or RDJ versions of Sherlock, but it is fun to see the breadcrumbs throughout the film come together.

Maybe it's not my place to comment on this aspect as a man who has never and will never know the struggles of women in this or any other country or time, but the women's rights aspect of the film felt a bit simplified and on the nose. There wasn't very much nuance. I think it's always easy to paint gender discrimination as bad when it's as simple and universally agreed upon as ""women should or shouldn't vote"". It's much harder to discuss the intricacies that women deal with in modern society -- the right to make decisions on their own bodies, the right to earn the same paycheck as a man. The film also lacked any and all nuance on the struggles of women of color. If we're going to acknowledge women's rights in 20th century London, shouldn't we also acknowledge the struggles for black women? This is a children's movie, so perhaps this isn't the place for such nuances. But it is important for me to acknowledge where this film, which spends most of its time with the struggles of women, fails to fully capture the story.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film was the way it was edited. The little animations and cuts were fantastic. When Enola is solving a puzzle, you can see words scramble and unscramble until she's found the answer. I particularly loved the animation depicting the corkscrew fighting move, as well as the old timey film slides detailing what phase of her plan she was on when she lost count. 

Overall, this is a family friendly, toned down, female driven film in the style of the Sherlock stories we've all come to love. The cast is fantastic, highlighted by a rising star in MBB. They bring a great energy to the screen. The puzzles are a bit simple, making it easy for kids, but they're depicted in a fun way. I'm not sure this is a movie I could see myself or my kids watching again and again, but it's two hours well spent.",iyme06
g6ddt8e,"Great movie, hope there will be a sequel. But the malcolm in the middle style was sometimes a bit too much for me",iyme06
g6ermw0,"This is a perfect example for what a 6/10 movie on imdb SHOULD look like. 

Slightly above average, decent performances - with exceptions. Good - but way too on-the-nose - message. Great set/costume design, except when it's pretty obviously subpar CG and a straight-forward plot, if you disregard the underdeveloped mothers intention and the passages were logic gets stretched (like when tf did he put the breastplate on?). 

For the target audience (~12-14 year olds) this is probably quite great. For everyone else it is a fine movie. Best direct comparison I'd say would be the shitty Artemis Fowl movie (gifted protagonist, ""missing"" parent, discovers a plot that involves said parent) and in that regard the quality and heart of Enola Holmes is on a different plane of existence.

And  Sherlock keeps quiet listening to her nodding. Looks like Henry Cavill  was paid for each line separately and thus he had so little.

I could do without this Mycroft though.",iyme06
g6f3uyz,"In general, I liked the movie. I liked Henry as Holmes. He is awkward with his sister, but shows obvious care. I like the little glimpses of his deductive skills. It's early in his career as a detective, so he is not as well known. Also, he isn't the main character.
While he isn't the Holmes that we have come to expect, he is a reasonable alternative. The basic Holmes-esk personality traits are there. Honestly, I'm fine with his portrayal of Holmes. It fits the reality of this world.

I thought that the relatively slow burn relationship between Enola and the boy was nice. It felt pretty natural. They had good chemistry together by the time that the film ended. It was good to see his slow reveal as more than a spoiled rich kid. I hope he is developed more. Maybe be her Watson.

Considering that Enola was trained to fight from an early age, I kinda expected her to do better. But that was against people not trying to kill her. Not to mention, an experienced assassin. So, I can understand why she didn't fare so well in those fights. 

I liked how she broke the 4th wall. It was done in a fun way. It didn't distract from the movie. Personally, I thought that it added to it.

As for her mom's story, eh. I could take it or leave it. It was the cause of the movie happening. It makes some sense, but I was expecting something more. It just didn't feel satisfying for an ending. It tied up ok. That said, the rest of the movie was great! I really enjoyed it, and hope they make more.",iyme06

I thought I would really enjoy the movie but I spent 2 hours saying ""wait what?"" constantly.I'm not trying to create drama or anything but I find the movie really bad.

I'm going to glance past the obvious plot armor that makes a 16yo girl invicible.

The plot is just .. dumb.Mother leaves kid out of nowhere, kid goes to find her. She find out her mother literally plans to blow up the house of lords because she wants votes for women. Ok cool, anyways, let's go help this random ass kid I found on the train.

Enola is going to solve the kid's case, because her mother one time told her that sometimes she doesn't need to save people, and let nature run it's course. So she decides to ignore that and become her own person I guess?

How exactly did she solved the case? Because she didn't.  She brought the dude to his big ass mansion to tell the family, but somehow in a house with literally hundreds of servants (as show in a photo), nobody heard shots. Also she thought the uncle was the killer, but it was actually the grandmother so she messed up, and also got the guy killed (saved by plot/metal armor).

And for the biggest ""wait wat"", the kid GOES TO VOTE IN THE SAME BUILDING ENOLA KNEW HER MOTHER WAS PLANNING TO BLOW UP THE WHOLE MOVIE.

I don't know man, the plot is just weird.I feel like the movie got good reviews because it talks about feminism, and they coulnd't afford to say anything bad in fear of not getting slapped by ""ok so you hate women"".  


Edit: Also forgot about another nonsense. Sherlock was proud that his sister beat him to the case.. What case?   
\-Finding the missing mother, which no one of them solved?   
\-The politics plot, which Sherlock said he doesn't want to get involved?  
\-Finding Enola? which, sure, he coulnd't beat Enola at finding Enola ..  


Just weird man",iyme06
g8la1fr,"Enjoyable watch, but nothing exceptional. I also thought it was weirdly violent (having a grown man fight and attempt to drown a kid, or trying to choke another).

g6en16t,"A terrible attempt at a female empowerment movie, totally filled with loose ends that don't get tied up, and ends up falling back into the romantic trope of a teen flick. 

The fourth wall breaking from Enola becomes obnoxious and in my opinion, is an attempt to distract the viewer with wit and conversation whilst being able to ignore the total lack of content in the film.

What happened to Eudoria and her plot to bomb, something. What was she even planning to bomb, parliament?

How convenient that Enola used the Caesar cipher on exactly the right day, otherwise she would've gone to the royal hall at 5pm many days early.

She had no reason to go back and save Tewkesbury on the train, any normal person with a sense of self preservation would've left and allowed him to die.

How is it that Enola is 16 years old, but is consistently able to pass as 22, and at one point she even passes as a widow. 

This film relies heavily on suspension of disbelief despite being a film that should be grounded in reality, and also requires you to ignore glaring issues, whilst trying to accept the female empowerment message despite falling into the same romance tropes.

All in all a 4/10 film, lots of big names in an attempt to save the terrible plot. Hats off to all the actors, although I think Brown went a little too far with the accent, despite being British herself.",iyme06
g6u14jw,"That was such a fun movie. Can anyone suggest me similar ones? The theme I enjoyed the most was an intelligent girl being underestimated and told to follow conservative societal norms. I was feeling vicariously enraged at Mycroft and absolutely loved how she handled those challenges.

Also, I like how she wasn't just automatically perfect or beating everyone. She had potential but made mistakes, failed, struggled and _then_ succeeded.


Are there any other movies like these?",iyme06
g6e1tlv,"I'm glad they didn't make Enola totally upstage Sherlock, she was a great character. Though I do think she's far too modern, she has the values of a modern day teenage girl, which I doubt entirely represents what 19th century feminists were like, but hey ho.",iyme06
g6eq66i,Couldn’t even finish it. Made it halfway through and thought it was boring and unfunny,iyme06
g6glegf,"Terrible film. 

Watching MBB trying to act for two hours is excruciating. The feminist subplot is under exploited and transformed into a feel good never don't give up you can do it message. 

It's those kind of movies for the masses where everything is explained two, sometimes three time, just in case you didn't understood the underwritten plot. 

Even the music underline every emotion without an ounce of subtility nor creativity. 

The constant 4th wall break makes it look like a tik tok video.  
Which I guess is what was intended, since I don't see how you can enjoy this piece if you are not a teenager.

Art direction and set design is nice though, and for once the forced netflix diversity is not cringy and feels natural in the director's modern fun take on the Victorian era. So they did that well at least.

I loved the movie and loved the character but now I'm confused. Do they have a point?

I also thought the empowerment parts were confusing. They gave out a lot of the trite ""You can do anything you want!"" type of messages, especially in her mother's advice, but then they also clearly showed that an empowered woman was *not* acceptable in that society and would be stymied, bound, and forced into submission. Even the climactic victory of getting a suffrage vote passed had to be done by proxy, via the Viscount. Empowerment takes more than just a can-do attitude, it requires real systematic change.

I'm not complaining about the feminist theme, i just think it's made very poorly and cheap. Even my gf, who is a very passionate feminist, despise the movie and said this actually hurt the movement instead of helping it. What's up with this constant hate towards men? Telling how they are awful, and useless and how Enola is not supposed to help anyone, specially men, wtf? Feminism is not about hating men and it worries me that this type of content is being normalized and being fed up to the current generation.",iyme06
g6iib5z,"MBB is not a very good actor, Claflin is a complete ham, as per usual, and Cavill... well, they obviously couldn't afford him for more than a week of shooting.  The script is rambling, and serves no use in trying to offer up a plot.  MBB being a producer was obviously a huge mistake, because whatever vision she had for a young, feminist leading lady, is trite and unimaginative. The ""yes people"" surrounding this creation made it forgettable, and at times insufferable.",iyme06
g6fsf6a,"This was a great film but it really was a bait and switch with the plot.  We never really found out what their mother was up to. And even her reappearance answered nothing.  Saying she had to leave to make the world better for her daughter didn't explain why she had to leave without so much as a goodbye, nor did they really discover her plans. Just a bunch of explosives no explanation of how they were to be used. I found that aspect to be very disappointing but otherwise I loved the film.",iyme06
g6gxmdj,"I thought the overall movie was pretty decent. The only thing I couldn't get behind is her mom being a domestic terrorist. While that goes perfectly with how history played out, it still doesn't change the fact that she wanted to hurt people. If I found out my mom was a domestic terrorist I wouldn't just take her back and go ""oh well you didn't actually hurt anyone"" and be all smiley. SHE HAD A WHOLE WAREHOUSE OF EXPLOSIVES! I really thought she was going to be mad at her mom as she should have been and that would have made for a more interesting story IMO.",iyme06

g6hmhky,"Has Gorman ever played a heroic character Torchwood excepted?  He's getting to be like Sean Bean.  ""Oh look Gorman's in this.  Guess I know who the bad guy's gonna be"".

Got mixed up and thought this was a series and couldn't figure out how Cavill found the time to be in it.  Hope it does become a movie series.  Enjoyable movie all around.

Maybe they can cast Sam Witwer to be Dr. Watson.  Enola can serve as the reason they meet.  Maybe she works with the Dr. off and on before giving Sherlock the heads up.  Or Sherlock starts with  the cocaine and Enola gets concerned since ~~Minecroft~~ Mycroft washes his hands of the matter.  She gets Dr. Watson to help.

Yeah.  Not familiar with the books so don't know if the good Dr. appears in them.  Also know that Sherlock's not the main focus.  Then again Enola might use Dr. Watson as a nom de plume to chronicle her and Sherlock's cases for the *Strand* because really a woman detective?  Who would believe such blather.

Sherlock and Mycroft weren't portrayed well. Sherlock barely spoke at all and Mycroft was just a default traditional posh Victorian.

They made the villian quite obvious in this movie. When Grandmother Tewksberry and Enola had that talk and made it known that she had opposing views with her dead son and her missing grandson, it was quite obvious. Wish they had saved that towards the end, after she shot Tewksberry.

This movie might have been better as a series as well. 

Anyways it was a good movie that had a nice message, despite the mother abandoning her children lol. I can’t wait for the sequels!",iyme06
g79a7rw,"The script is definitely a weak point when it comes to the mystery. It was clear from the beginning that the grandmother had something to do with it, since she was the only character they bothered to highlight. And if I saw it coming from a mile away, so should Sherlock, who is really dumbed down to assure Enola gets there first (I was kinda waiting for a twist where we discover Sherlock was ahead of the narrative from the get-go and excused himself from the case so Enola could have a chance to crack it, but that was not the case). That being said, this a charming adventure and a decent start of a new franchise. Millie is a good actress, the production values are solid, and the messages of gender roles (Enola gets to be a boy, a lady, a widower and so on) are on-point for a contemporary young adult audience.

g97mial,"I got bored in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and as the rule of cinematography says, if you haven’t catch the public in the first 10 minutes, you lost the public for the rest of the film. And it did, the over use of the 4rd wall breaking, a sub plot that lead nowhere, the use of Sherlock Holmes just as a follower (you better not use an extremely famous or talented detective at all) and the full reverse roll of the damsel in distress with the boy, in which this comes my over all issue of all, feminism, where do I begin with this movie? Is not that feminism is bad teaching, no, don’t get me wrong, is the message of the movie what being wrong, for me for reduced to ""as a girl/woman, you are independent, tough, emotionless and rude until you meet a good looking and rich guy"" this was the whole throw away for the main reason I guess a woman wrote the novel, which was teaching about feminism in the first place.

g6kn7pa,"I was so charmed and delighted by this film. Like, sure it has its flaws (like the unfinished radical feminist potential terrorist sect part of the story) but I would just catch myself smiling happily as I watched it.  A lot of that is down to MBB who is so incredibly charming and charismatic that she reminds me of the old school romantic comedy actress from the 90s - Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock et al. - who just had that kind of special charisma to carry a whole film on the strength of that alone.

But even they needed good supporting casts to truly make them sing and I really enjoyed everyone here. Tewks was funny and again a charming and in some ways an atypical male love interest, the chemistry was very sweet (and I fell for that Pride & Prejudice hand moment like most sane folks should). Henry Cavill is so damn likable when he gets to have  fun in a role - why does this man not get more work? Why is he not James Bond already?? Anyway, I haven't enjoyed a Sherlock Holmes portrayal this much in over two decades. I kind of loved Mycroft but I do hope he gets more development in the sequels, and there better be sequels.

Also shout out to Edith, Lestrade and Mama Holmes.

It was just great, easy fun with just enough believable action (MBB needs to do an action film - she sold those fight scenes super well). And I haven't felt that way with a film for a long time. It almost feels like Hollywood forgot how to make those kinds of movies. I hope to see more of this 'verse, and more films that make me this smiley.",iyme06

There really isn’t too many shows or movies on Netflix that I would again watch. I would really have loved to have seen Benedict as her brother but seeing Henry Cavill it was refreshing. I think he could play well as a side show or spin off but the little you see of him could be just enough.

Enola? Brown? Wow she plays the part so well. The acting is spot on. I enjoy her in this role so much better than Stranger Things. She is going to be one hell of a power house actor!",iyme06

\-Who expected a fun Holmes story spin-off to be historically accurate. Are people really this dense? Don't they realize that Sherlock Holmes was not a real person? Don't they realize that women voting was not started by a little girl? Have people lost the sense of reality and fantasy movies? ""Women did not learn jiu-jitsu in the past"" NO. SHIT.  
\-Sorry but I am not sure if I saw the same movie as everyone else, but I thought the movie was kinda anti-SJW lvl of feminism. The main protagonist called her own mother (who for me represented the extremist feminist) crazy and dangerous. She, the normal girl just doing herself and not being a cookie-cutter of a ""lady, she changed the world, not the radical feminists. Even went against her mother's advice to not get mingled with men, and the whole plot showed that men and women are good for each other. WHERE IS THE RADICAL FEMINISM PROPAGANDA?  
\-Bad acting. Mfs what are you talking about, they were all great.  
\-I was personally very tickled by the movie's plot. I thought it was fast-paced, fun, creative and kept me entertained. I feel like unless a movie is not a meme of a super adrenaline lvl of horror people will claim that it is boring. Are we losing touch with reality?",iyme06

I loved that at 16 Enola still *felt* like a child character. I kept forgetting MBB is the same age because I’m so used to seeing “teens” played by twenty-somethings. This was refreshing.

I hope they bring in Watson for the inevitable sequel.",iyme06
g6kn6kc,"This was cute. Some really stunning locations - I mean, that estate! Millie is an absolute delight - I loved seeing her play such a spirited character! More of that for her, please. It's strange to me that she hasn't done more work outside of Stranger Things so far. 

I liked the progression of Enola's relationship with the Marquess (also now I finally know how to pronounce that word), even though it was fairly typical. Still he ended up being a sweet character and wasn't actually useless. I also liked that their romance involved no kissing. It was refreshing not to be sexing up the teens. 

I generally find Henry Cavill a black hole of charisma but here, he was actually not bad! He and Millie had a nice rapport. 

I don't know anything about Mycroft from the books so all I can say is that Sam Claflin does not look remotely like he's older than Henry Cavill. And every time he called him little brother, I wanted to laugh. 

Otherwise I thought the storylines were kind of messy but I would watch another one of these. Pity we probably won't see Fiona Shaw back though.",iyme06

g6dzi40,The book was better. It was more gritty and real and paid good homage to the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and Victorian London.

Then later on Enola reinforces this idea by looking directly at the camera and says “our future is up to us.” Which is true everyone’s future is dependent upon them entirely. So after being supportive Initially, I completely disregard any underlying plot to this movie when Enola intentionally finds Mr.Basilweather on her own accord and then immediately belittles him and says “your a man when I tell you your a man” this was the most blatant example of anti masculinity but there are several others. This is just another Netflix movie to shove the film teams narrative down everyone’s throat riding on the coattails of the late and great Arthur Doyle.",iyme06
g6e7jey,"Superbly enjoyable film. Lighthearted with just enough mystery. I was surprised by the more violent scenes, but I felt it was an appropriate contrast to the upbeat nature of the rest of the film.

I’m mostly happy MBB got a leading role and exceeded my expectations. She exhibited great range, and her performance here will definitely lead to a bright future for her. She carried the film well.

It was interesting to see Cavill in a side role. Any more screen time for him would have undermined the fact that it’s not his story, but Enola’s. But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit I want to see more of him as Sherlock.",iyme06

Only thing that was really weird in my opinion was that we get absolutely no closure on the whole ""my mom might be trying to blow people up subplot"".

I understand she missed her mom but that might be some important information  🤔",iyme06
g6eoa49,"As a movie it was good, as an adaptation it felt like the creaters were trying to get as far away from the source material as they can get away with.

Now if you have never read the Enola Holmes series or are not well versed in Sherlock Holmes canon, you would really enjoy this movies. Yes there are many clichés in the movie and I figured out the ending 30 mins in, but the cinematography and the acting are great. The chemistry between Henry Cavill and Millie Bobby Brown is reminiscent of actual siblings. All in all its a nice girl power movie.

But, if you care about the sprit of the Enola Holmes series or care about the accurate representation of Sherlock Holmes canon, this movie will make you scream on many many occasions. The movie has taken great unnecessary pains in removing many points which were integral to the series plot. Enola herself seem to have lost much of her unique characteristics to be made into a general young adult female lead (though Mille Bobby Brown played Enola very well).

The character of Mycroft Holmes is only present in this by through name, as all his physical, mental, and behaviour attributes have been changed. And dear faithful Dr. Watson has been utterly neglected in the film by not even being graced with a mention.",iyme06

Did the reform vote pass or not? It seems it did, by the way Eudoria was so proud of Enola.

He also stated that Tewksbury's (however it's spelled) vote was decisive and it was made clear that he would vote in favor. So again I ask, does that mean Mycroft was never against it after all???

But it was yet another reminder that Sam Claflin has become an actor to keep track of as he puts his early ""pretty boy"" fluff roles way behind him. Will be interesting to see what new way he transforms his appearance the next time (admittedly his look here was close to that of *Peaky Blinders*)",iyme06
g6uvg43,"One scene spoiled the movie for me and that was the grandmother with the gun. They see her walking towards them and it starts to dawn on them that it's her that's behind the murder attempts on boyo's life. Admittedly she is shown as being very much closer to the gun than they are so we'll let them off for not diving for it, plus they don't know for sure she will pick it up.   

Next though she picks the gun up. Obviously she means to shoot them. She is in possession of the gun for ages, not pointing it at them. Enola makes a move towards the grandmother and boyo stops her. OK, why does he do that? Well we know later that he has put a tray or armour piece, whatever, under his shirt. Maybe it's his clever trick to get shot. But what if the grandmother shoots enola not him? Or enola and him, since she's a witness and all. What if the grandmother misses his chest or aims for his stupid head? Plus it's a shotgun with spray, not super accurate. Also, what does getting shot by his grandmother get him? They know she's evil already. They don't need the further evidence of her trying to kill them.  

Enola has plenty of time to disarm the grandmother anyway and she doesn't take it. Even after boyo has been shot and the grandmother still has the gun she does nothing! It's only the fact it needs reloading that saves her life. Then when she's all in grandmother's face she doesn't even so much as slap her. So much for equal rights, I guess being female and old means you get no physical retribution despite the fact you have just seemingly killed someone. If you're male though your head's getting stoved in with a wooden pinapple thing.   

&#x200B;

g6le136,"Felt like an odd film that was held together by the charm of Millie-Bobbie Brown. It struggled to get the tone right. On one had it has a light playfulness but then has a scene where she is almost brutally drowned by hand in a quite horrible, explicit scene. Then the next scene while still hiding she is perkily explaining to the audience how she has done self-defence training as if she gets nearly brutally drowned everyday. I get that this is not meant to be a super realistic film but you need some authenticity in character behaviour and a sense of weight.

I thought Sherlock was poorly cast - just a hunk of good looking man meat devoid of any charisma or substance who was completely passive through the whole thing. It would have had a much better character arc for Sherlock and Enola if we had a nerdy, cerebral, aloof, dorky looking Sherlock who gradually warms up to Enola seeing her cleverness and pluck.

And the ""changing society/male, pale & stale"" theme just felt too on the nose without any subtlety. Too many speeches instead of integrating it in better and keeping it realistic. 

But Millie is lovely with great energy and that kept me entertained for most of the film.",iyme06
g6s2vx9,"Alright, everyone had justifiably sung this movie's praises, which means I get to bitch. Three issues, in increasing order of importance:

1. Too much unrealistic diversity. Diversity is great in most cases because the world is diverse. Turn of the century London though? Not THAT diverse. Not Indian born Police Inspector diverse. Chinese dock workers were a good touch though. Also hard to blame the movie for that, it's dangerous to a film's health to be realistic in recent years, and further someone might have had a contact rider so it might have been a choice for good acting over realism. Plus the ultimate lesson of the film with the old grandmother being the killer was that class struggle is more important then identity politics.

2. To keep it short: corsets are just old fashioned full body bras. They're only painful to wear of you don't know what you're doing, and they can be quite comfortable. That is an inexcusable inaccuracy considering how much they play it up.

3. This point actually matters. Why did two totally different sets of clues lead both Enola and the assassin to the same place? Unless somehow the late Lord Tewkesbury etc etc was involved with the suffragette terrorists somehow and that led to his son having that location as an idea, but that was not stated at all in the film. Would have been easier to explain that somehow the assassin was tracking her, even if that would have required moving a few pieces around",iyme06

Like Cavill with Sherlock, I never would have chosen him for his role, but he did a superb job with the Mycroft character.

g6vko5d,"Oh come on guys. This movie had exactly four really great scenes and the rest was a mess: 

(1) the intro from the bike riding through the lack of carriage; 

(2) the first fight with bowler hat guy culminating with the wink in the water - just pretend she got away after and the scene ended there as it should have;  

(3) Edith explaining accurately and concisely to Sherlock why his lack of interest in politics is because the existing system benefits him and not because he has more important things to think about; and 

(4) Mycroft and Sherlock standing around waiting for Enola to not arrive where Caville is about to burst through his improbably shining blue suit is pretty great for several reasons too. 

I wonder if Netflix's productions schedule is too short? They say movies are made in post-production. And Netflix movies seem shoddily made, even when they have great talent. There's some good things here. It just seems like a draft.

The mother’s case is ultimately left for a possible sequel and the latter case was ridiculous and uninteresting.

I also think Lestrade's characterization isn't mentioned enough - it's brilliant how the plot uses the fact that he isn't as competent as Mycroft or Sherlock to drive the plot forward (the scene in the hairdresser with Mycroft stands out specifically since it shows that he couldn't identify Enola even though she basically outed herself to him - distracted both by her upstanding him (in true Holmes fashion, lol), and by the fact that she wasn't a perfect match because she had great poise), while still presenting him as a figure of commanding authority - because that's how Enola views him when she first meets him!",iyme06

As a movie it was well produced, the script was lighthearted and fun. I hope to see this turn into a few more movies. I was a bit sceptical on Henry Cavill playing Sherlock, due to his sheer size. But I was proven wrong, and once again confermed in his ability and range as an actor. The only problems I had, hand on my heart, was that I felt a lack of exploration in the characters, and in the closing shot, they drive on the right side. The film is set in, I believe 1884, where as the law made it mandetory from 1835 to drive on the left hand side. So I view this as a little mistake they made :)

We could have avoided so much of the ""Mycroft is supposed to be smart"" and all the other comparisons to the OG Sherlock Holmes stories if these characters were named anything else. They would have been perfectly good all-new characters.

Instead she put her daughter in extreme danger while she searched for her.

I agree that HC's portrayal of Sherlock is less of an eccentric and more of a detached asocial genius, which is a fresh take nowadays.

I admit, even as a female, I was kinda worried about the strongly militant messaging that her mother was sending, and I was glad when Enola subverted that. I was also glad that she wasn't a perfect Mary Sue character that knows how to do everything on the first try and is somehow undefeatable. She was a bumbling mess some of the time, which made her more endearing and relatable.

Tewksbury was a bit of an idiot but he was also smart and resourceful, and saved her as much as she saved him.

I actually liked that that even though the film set up the fact that 16 year old Enola had Kung Fu training since birth, she still couldn't actually fight a full grown man. She held her own well enough, but look at both of their fight scenes. 

1st: she can't escape his attempt to drown her, so she tricks him into thinking she she's already drowned. 

2nd:  she still can't beat him hand-to-hand, resorts to blowing him up with her knowledge of chemistry.

3rd: even as the triumphant 3rd act resolution to her mastering the corkscrew move, she only manages to trip him into smashing his own head on a spike after getting handily beaten herself.

g6z8zz7,"I get your points but I think what your missing is the movie is about Enola finding her identity, she is not her mom and she is not Sherlock. She is very similar to both. Her resolution was different than her mothers and ultimately she doesn’t join her mothers ideals fully. Both her and Sherlock solve the case, Sherlock by clever deduction because that’s how he is, it’s a game to him. Enola, while very smart like Sherlock, is very different from him and has a different approach and different skills. She is much more bullish than him, took his shark dangling comments very literally, is actually invested in the people around the crime. She didn’t try to deduce which family member was enemy number 1 she just confronted them because she knew one of them was it. The way she solved it is very different then what Sherlock did which is why to me, thus  movie works so well, she is not a “young female Sherlock”, she is smart like him but she is entirely her own character.",iyme06
g6p170r,"Agree. I enjoyed it a lot but there were some clunky parts that held it down a bit. She zoomed right from ""where is my wonderful mother"" to ""oh wow. my mother is an domestic terrorist"" over the span of a minute and really didn't seem to be affected by it.

A huge part of our perception of the Victorian era has been subject to two centuries of whitewashing.  London was the centre of a global empire and had plenty of people with black and brown skin.

Lestrade always seemed to me to be over-compensating for being an outsider, so I have no problem with him being cast as Asian.

Edith being black and running a tea shop was pretty consistent with history.

The only casting decision to add diversity which didn't seem likely was the black girl at the boarding school.  This would have been really unlikely, however, Asian kids would have been relatively common (although possibly not girls).",iyme06

I think it suffered from having the competing storylines of that and her mother's disappearance with the Marquess and his drama. The film has certain characters sort of state key points about progress and change which are great, absolutely, but it doesn't spend much time developing them which is a shame. The suffragette movement in the UK was quite storied and fascinating and they could easily have built an actual film around it and some of the real women who were involved. I like the idea of portraying the suffragette movement more seriously but then actually spend some time on it.

Others in this thread have discussed the reality of it a bit better if you want to read around, there's some interesting history.

> How convenient that Enola used the Caesar cipher on exactly the right day, otherwise she would've gone to the royal hall at 5pm many days early.

She looked in the newspaper. That day's newspaper. That she literally just bought, that day, from the newspaper boy. She looks in the papers every single day. That's a whole plot point.

> She had no reason to go back and save Tewkesbury on the train, any normal person with a sense of self preservation would've left and allowed him to die.

That is the whole point of the sheep on the cliff story, and Enola's struggle with trying to be what her mother taught her (let him die), and struggling with her emotions (help him though it doesn't benefit her). Though the sheep on the cliff metaphor comes later, we see right away that she's struggling with self-preservation vs helping others.

> How is it that Enola is 16 years old, but is consistently able to pass as 22, and at one point she even passes as a widow.

I don't think we're meant to think the grandmother believed she was 22, but it would not be unheard of for a teenager/young adult to be a widow.

gbu9hcb,"I believe the movie takes place in the 1880s, and at that time in Britain a single female was well within her rights to own property and operate a business. In fact just before this time it was only married woman who could not do so as all legal ownership went directly to the husband and then subsequently to the sons, which I suppose is what they were going for with Enola’s mother relying on her son to provide money and why he had custody of Enola. Of course by the 1880s there actually would have been a law passed to give Enola’s mother those rights so that’s weird. 

There were in fact a number of woman property owners and business woman in this time. As to whether a black woman would own such is a bit more iffy. It wasn’t against the law for a black woman in Britain to own property or run a business at that time. Mary Seacole stands out as a precedent as a black woman who ran her own establishment- though that was more of a medical and war based establishment. Typically there would not be woman of color who had the finances, resources, or knowledge to own such businesses at the time. We can assume that Enola’s mother, amongst other members of their group provided funds to support this business as it was important to training their members in self defense. 

More unrealistic was their use of jujutsu as this was not utilized by the suffragette movement until the 1900s, though perhaps I have the timeline of the story wrong.",iyme06

OK so the women's suffrage movement was a widescale radical movement in the United Kingdom and other countries to enfranchise women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

As you can imagine with any large scale radical movement, there were a lot of factions within the movement.  However, some divides were bigger than mere factions and the biggest one was the one between those who wanted direct action and the incrementalists who wanted to limit to non-violent protest.

Various factions on the direct action side took part in what would, today, he called domestic terrorism.  Including violent protest, property destruction, arson, bombings and such.

Usually when a film covers the period and shows the movement as a secondary plot, its always the non-violent side that gets shown (think Mary Poppins) but the reality was there was significant support and practise of direct action.",iyme06

Only the last 10 novels of the Holmes canon presents Holmes as affectionate towards Watson, respectful of Women, liking dogs, and expressive of emotion... and wouldn't you know it only those last 10 novels are still in copyright.

The complaint argues:

>After the stories that are now in the public domain, and before the Copyrighted Stories, the Great War happened. In World War I Conan Doyle lost his eldest son, Arthur Alleyne Kingsley. Four months later he lost his brother, Brigadier-general Innes Doyle. When Conan Doyle came back to Holmes in the Copyrighted Stories between 1923 and 1927, it was no longer enough that the Holmes character was the most brilliant rational and analytical mind. Holmes needed to be human. The character needed to develop human connection and empathy.  
>  
>Conan Doyle made the surprising artistic decision to have his most famous character—known around the world as a brain without a heart—develop into a character with a heart. Holmes became warmer. He became capable of friendship. He could express emotion. He began to respect women.

It kind of feels like recent Sherlock iterations (and Sherlock types, like Dr House, etc) have compounded on themselves, trying to outdo themselves with how much of an asshole he is. It was kind of nice to see a Sherlock who wasn't insufferable, but I think it was mainly so he and Mycroft would act as ""good cop, bad cop"" for Elona.

In the books, she ran away not because she was trying to start a feminist rebellion/revolution but for the simple reason of being tired of not being able to do what she wanted to do. Yes, she lived in a huge manor and had servants. But it was a gilded cage. As a woman during that time, despite her being a widow and despite being a full grown mature adult, it was her son who owned the manor and the fortune when his father died. Women weren't allowed to own property. If she wrote a book and earned money from it, as head of the household, Mycroft would be entitled to that sum. Not her. And Mycroft let it be well known that she was at his mercy. That she could be thrown out on his whim. So, she better stay in line. 

Instead, she stole money little by little and ran away to London, where she led a double life as a nun who helped the needy people of East End. She left money to Enola so that she could do the same. Run away and be free of her brother's rule. In the book, Enola doesn't become Sherlock's ward. In fact, movie Sherlock is far more kind and nurturing than first book Sherlock, who kept on dismissing Enola as a silly, overly emotional girl. So, the first book ends with Enola staying in London and becoming a detective of sorts. But rather than solving murders like her brother does, she finds lost things and people.",iyme06

And just a few minutes before that scene, I thought ""I hope there won't be a scene with the mother where she tells Enola that all of this had kind of been her plan all along."" Because too much random things happened for this to make sense. However, what actually happened was worse. The mom just left Enola with some money and some clues, but the clues actually had no real meaning except to find her own path, which could've have gotten her anywhere and ended up nearly killing her at least three times.

And then, when they reunite, the mother is surprised that Enola influenced the vote and then has to take off again - for whatever reason. The mother's militant group apparently also had this elaborate plan for a terrorist attack regarding the suffrage vote but didn't go through with it even though they had no idea about Lord Tewkesbury.

To be fair though, she does imply at one point that she suspects the whole family's in on it, with Tewkesbury's opinion making her lean towards the uncle.",iyme06

But how was he to know?  The entire point of what they were doing was to keep things hidden from him and the rest of society, to keep them looking like - at the most - exactly that:  mischief.  So why does he deserve that much of a reaction?  

I feel like the writers wanted to keep Sherlock as a fundamentally good, if out-of-touch, character; so they didn't have him say ""stop being such silly little women and try to act proper"", but they had Edith's *reaction* to his comments be just the same as if he had.

I.e. poor writing.

Also, they were literally planning on blowing shit up.  The only thing that stopped them from setting off bombs in government buildings was the success of the vote.  That's...really, really bad.  I find it hard to sympathize with Edith, or with Enola's mother.

Sure, the news story about the boys jumping off of the train would have still happened, but had they just hidden out then Enola wouldn't have gone to Limehouse Lane, gotten in a fight with bowler hat guy, and blown up the building.

The words that Enola picked up in the suffragette meeting of her mother and deciphered as places... It kinda feels like they were also describing a potential plot. I don't remember it exactly, but it was ""something something the husband"" and ""or entangle her in it""... or something like that. And that could have been alternate plans - try to arrange a marriage between Enola and the boy so she would get caught up in the case and end up saving the son and/or finding out who murdered his father - or she would need to entangle her in the son's story so she would get behind things. And it makes sense that Enola's mother would not want to just marry away her daughter for some plot.

Only problem with that take is that it seems unlikely that she could both make some clever ciphers with those words that describe places relevant to the plot, and the plot itself, and then also to deliberately create enough ""happy circumstances"" to cause Enola and the son to meet. That's some crazy mastermind planning that seems beyond unlikely.

g6v9xnd,"Yes! I loved that they showed her during her gullible, oblivious moments as well. When I first saw the trailer, I was a bit put off cause I was expecting enola to be another Mary sue (I just watched Mulan 2020 so that was in my head) and it was SO refreshing to see that she wasn't!

Even though she's trained in combat and she's well read and educated, she's still not perfect and there are gaps in her knowledge, and she's accepted that and she's willing to keep learning. I'm so glad they made her strong and smart without making her a superhero.

Sorry for the rant, yall. Mulan 2020 really pissed me off.",iyme06

g6istgs,"I think, for the purposes of this movie, he's being cast as a representative of the traditional status quo where women are seen as lesser only there to be married off and have babies.

So I guess he resents his mother for not sticking to the rules (and also lying to him about money).",iyme06
g6xbnl5,No he should train her to be a super detective like Sherlock!,iyme06
g6ek2cj,Brown and her sister have full producer credits so I think it's pretty likely this will be a full series of films (if they're successful).,iyme06
g6k1z2t,"I'd love it of they'd adapt the other books. Since the readers have already been introduced to Enola, the plots of the other 5 revolve more on the her solving mysyeries. I'm also excited for them to introduce Lady Cecily.",iyme06

g6hmb4j,"I noticed you didn't mention Man From U.N.C.L.E.! If you haven't seen that, it's my favourite movie from Cavill. 

Also, Stanger Things is an easy recommendation. Brown is great in it. My SO and I were talking about the exact same thing regarding her subtle acting in the closeups.",iyme06

iwtfx9s,"I was actually kind of thinking we'd get Enola vs her mother at the end, with Enola talking her down from doing something properly bad with the bombs and showing there are better ways to bring change than violent terrorism!",iyme06
g6jb38f,"A lot of his anger is quite justified when you see it from his perspective though. His mother has been lying and stealing from him, and not raising Enola the way she said she would. He was paying for EVERYTHING and to me that's actually a hugely disrespectful thing to do to a family member. He resorts to more drastic measures because he isn't sure what else to do with her. He is probably a little harsh on Enola but that's only because she is continuing to disrespect him after everything her mother had done. He also genuinely believed she would be better off as a trained lady and respected the woman who ran the school (who herself also genuinely believed she was helping Enola).

As for his intelligence, we don't really see him in his own field of speciality. He basically runs the government from behind the scenes and we can obviously see he is well-informed on politics. It should be pointed out that he does successfully find Enola and bring her back in, whereas Sherlock fails to do so. Admittedly he does so with a hefty reward to the right people, but intelligence is partly just using the right tools.",iyme06
g6t9do0,"Yes. I was thinking the same thing... wasn’t he supposed to be super smart, smarter than Holmes and gave advice to heads of state behind the scenes.. but was kind of a big physically and sort of lazy to verify his hypothesis?

He doesn’t like to do the physical stuff like go around looking for clues, but sometimes Sherlock will go to Mycroft for help thinking things out, and vice versa if Mycroft needs someone to do physical detective work.

It also seemed like he was good natured and they got along well (from what I remembered). Anyways, I guess I just have to chuck it to this movie depicts when they were younger...",iyme06
g71idx6,I agree. I also didn't like Sam Claflin in the role at all.,iyme06
g6rzz4h,"Mycroft was the one behind the plot to kill Tewkesbury. The assassin said “England,” not the grandmother, was who he worked for, Mycroft worked in government and he lost his vote by one vote.

g6qilm0,I'd be pissed off too if I was forced to fund terrorist activities when I thought I was maintaining my family home.,iyme06
g6hbjiv,I always got the impression is that Sherlock claiming Mycroft is more intelligent is merely so Sherlock looks better when he (continually) bests him.,iyme06
g6h6a57,"At the end, when Enola escapes from the school and is in the car. She's faced with a decision to go to the Tewkesbury house or go to London to hide. At that point Sherlock was already investigating and figured out the mystery the next morning. Enola wanted to go confront whoever to ""bait the sharks"". Even the Dowager told them that his mother and uncle were in London that night looking for them. If she just went to London that night, Sherlock would have informed Lestrad the next morning and they would have gone to arrest the Dowager.

That said, they might not have had enough proof.",iyme06
g6xmqrj,All of the ciphers in that scene end up being street names; Enola unscrambles them to figure out Limehouse Lane.,iyme06

g6g4lyb,"Intruders is on Hulu and Amazon in the US, for those looking to check it out.",iyme06
g6dqvhb,"Well if one of the two brothers would actually take any action in Enola's life, it would be Mycroft. Sherlock didn't really bother. And knowing the time and setting, Mycroft would have definitely felt she needed to go to school, become a lady, and settle down. In that way, he is practical. Cold, but practical.",iyme06
g6di3b6,"Yeah that is one thing that I kinda did not like in this movie, I kinda wish that his character is less dickish in this movie. Hopefully, this movie adressed that in the sequel.",iyme06
g6ebvvi,“YOU ARE MY WARD!”,iyme06
g6e710a,"He is there to play a block that Enola has to overcome to achieve her goals. They couldn't get Sherlock to play that role, probably because they're setting him up in a team-up sequel. Mycroft got the short end of the stick.

Honestly he's just for plot device, imo.

Also I haven't read the book this movie is based on. It's possible that Mycroft's characteristics is accurate to the book portrayal.",iyme06
g6nx4ai,Because it's a movie about Enola and three geniuses would be overkill,iyme06
g6xqq8y,"I really enjoyed 1922. In The Tall Grass was better than I thought it was going to be. Geralds Game was entertaining as well, wait... am I sensing a theme here 😟",iyme06

g6oic8a,"How was he emasculated? Please offer clear examples.

Despite growing up as a no doubt pampered young lordling, he ran away from home. The guy had an interest in botany (a common pursuit for men of that class, and even Sherlock is known as a chemist) and got to put his skills to good use to save both him and Enola from starving through the night. He  saved Enola from her crappy school and during the fight with the bowler hat man. He was smart enough to protect himself with the armour. And in the end, he took his rightful place as a marquess in parliament.

He had great characterisation.",iyme06
g6vyrii,"The bowler hat guy is someone we assume to be a good enough assassin to be hired to kill a royal yet he holds her head underwater for 45 seconds and then lets her go.

He walks up the hallway with a loaded shotgun while they hide behind a foot wide statue on the right. Instead of stepping to the left, for a clear shot, he shoots the statue and then takes his eyes off of them as he steps closer while loading the gun. 

The movie didn’t just shit over men, like people are saying in the comments, but the bowler hat guy is the worst assassin I’ve ever seen.",iyme06
g6dkdzn,"Yes, great point!

Not like he got a good view of her at all",iyme06
g6mdqhv,Tbf his job was killing Tewes not Enola,iyme06
g7e7zkc,But they do explain it in the movie? There's a scene with a paperboy talking about the bill and you see a group of men talking about how working class men might get to vote,iyme06
g6kj2nt,"Eh, how much 1884 politics did you REALLY want explained in the movie?  Mycroft mentions that it’ll mean “more uneducated voters,” they say “reform” plenty, and the general progression from aristocratic society to democratic society is generally background knowledge enough among most of the audience.",iyme06

g7pxsa1,"Conan's Sherlock is no Gary Stu. Many see his intelligence as unfriendly and therefore he has few friends or better said only one: Watson.

A Gary Stu would be loved by everyone despite his or her failures.",iyme06
g71l2y1,"I think so too. I don't disklike the casting. I think it was good. Only the observation of the over the top praise. Even in this thread there are a lot of comments from 2 day-old accounts praising the film. It is weird. 

In the barrel scene, it would have work better that the mother or the jujitsu lady help her, but off-screen. Then she regains conciousness in the coffee shop or somethign like that.",iyme06
g8vtkkx,"Yeah, but Jane Austen is able to represent those people accurately for their time. Elizabeth Bennet still did a lot of lady stuff and wasn't a complete ANTI ALL THINGS EXPECTED OF WOMEN... And is able to show both sides of the coin for both men and women... Which is why she was such a good author and story teller.  Her characters weren't just shallow caricatures of a generalized ideology.",iyme06
g6vgh0x,You're in for a treat,iyme06
gbx1w76,"You’re welcome, I think one of the better aspects of the movie is that it prompts questions and discussions of this sort. They do play fast and loose with historical accuracy but on the whole they represented some interesting aspects of the time period and the suffragette movement in general.",iyme06
g6ha8ga,"> I just thought Enola's reaction to her mom at the end didn't really square up to what her mother was planning to do.

I don't know, going to 'war' to change the world for you... and making it abundantly clear that she was never abandoned..

Seemed fine to me.",iyme06

Being offered £5 for your clothes, 7 months wages give or take.. Yeah, you'd bite their hand off for that.",iyme06
g6kh50b,"I only managed to get through the first half hour or so, but the movie is just too in your face with it. And there's no real nuance either: it's either just straight-up exposition - like in that cringey corset scene - or it's just a rehash of the good 'ol ""men bad, women strong"" trope. It doesn't really elevate women through their own accomplishments, but more through the idiocy/bigotry/failures of male characters. And it occasionally degenerates into simply bashing men for the sake of bashing men.

Anyway, take my opinion with a grain of salt, cause as I said, I didn't watch the whole thing; that scene with the black martial artist running a self-defense class exclusively for women in 1880's London was just so mind-numbingly dumb I couldn't keep watching.",iyme06
g6koyaj,"Ah.  Well this movie was based on a different series of books, so that’s why.",iyme06

g6uqj1g,"Why would be make dedications? He's a politician, not a detective. Why at all would dedications matter to him at all when he was a ward to take care of and a house.

Also another scene I found pointless was the widow one. She dressed as a widow to get by unnoticed, she goes to the mansion to find information I guess? and the first thing they ask her was ""yo why you a widow tho?""   


It seems like the whole point of the widow scene was for her to meet with the police guy. Or maybe they really liked the ""master of disguise"" aspect, and they went overboard with it, overusing it. Like the young lord guy from the flower shop.  ""Most powerfull family in London is after me, one of them sent a killer, I'm gonna sell flowers in the middle of London. Nobody will notice me, I have slighly shorter hair now"".   


It seems like the more I think about the movie, the more dumb shit I find.

g6q9j83,"But its still a film that heavily borrows from Doyle works.

It literally is popular because of that. So why should we not respect the original writer definition of the characters. 

Misunderstanding the original characters from the book you are heavily taking, smells more like self insert a fanfiction than an new interpretation. Some will see it one way, the other other way. 

You may have read the YA books this was based on and some people did, but most of the people know Sherlock and Mycroft from the ACD books and thats who will they compare it to. And they might say, mycroft and Sherlock portrayal feels off. And they will also say, why was Mycroft made into that... 

Sherlock generally doesn't really care for people unless they impress him. He values Watson as companion, also because Watson comes with a set of usefull skills that can aid him. 

Sherlock in books has literally distanced themselves from his family and even respect Mycroft mostly because of his wit. The only women he shows his respect too in book, namely maybe two of them, are the ones who impressed him with either deduction skills or straight up beaten him in the game... 

Seeing him being wierdly paternal and seeing Mycroft being jealous od something he has loads of in books, and especially taking out Sherlock respect of him, will bother a lot of people who know them from the original books. Not from some YA version of them. 

Yes he is polite in the books as per se, gentleman of the good birth in those times were, but him respecting people that's whole other level. And yes obviously they borrowed that line from the books too. And that's okay. Its film for young girls. 

But making Sherlock some sort of paternal figure. Sherlock in the same way as Mycroft would understand the importance of the putting the girl into a good school. Thats would pretty nuch be the only way for the women there. Being a gentlewoman still gave you a lot of options that, being a low born didn't give you. Sherlock would know how important it would be. He after all too mantained a good societal status too. Albeit a scholar and eccentric detective, but men were allowed to do much more and act much less proper then women were. The film seems to completely ignore the fact that empowerment of women comes form the high societal circles too. Because thats where women in those times had proper education. No one important will listen to you if you dont have a good breeding. However being an educated woman of good birth and good status would give enola much more opportunity than being a street runt. And they also had a scamdal rags in those times too. Enola status would be dragged down by it a lot. And Sherlock would know this perfectly. He would advise her to follow the path Mycroft had too. 

So basically the films kinda ignores the victorian societal standards because more tham anything it wants to tell a modern story in a strangely modern victorian times. And yes okay, some like it some dont. 

And making Mycroft into a wierd shouting wierdo, really cheapens his character in general. 

This book is obviously twisting the original series in order to make a modern interpretation for the teen finale crowd but it wont change the fact some people wont like this new off feeling portrayal of their favourite literary characters.",iyme06
g6ur9f2,"The link with his traditionalism is that Netflix (or the book writer or whatever this Mycroft is based off of) made him stupid to link the two attributes, like Disney making evil characters ugly. There is a trend of eliminating nuance and this isn't the first show to do it. Evil genius concept is now problematic.

He would make deductions because he has motive now and an interest in his mother and his sister. He would not waste the time in visiting his mother's room personally, yet not deducing anything about something he actually wants solved. It doesn't make sense at all, and we're never shown his superior intellect, anywhere. This is definitely deliberate.",iyme06

It's partly for this reason that he tends to reject them wholesale and find them ""untrustworthy"" and inscrutable.

g6pqywo,"> But bombs made me think first of the sort of stuff anarchics did around the same time, which usually involved actually killing people

That's propaganda.

Anarchists were using very similar tactics to the direct action suffragettes.  Property, statutes, that sort of thing.  The claims that these groups were targeting civilians were almost always propaganda from the authorities.

The same is somewhat true of the IRA.  The Provisional IRA did not target civilians directly, they used warnings agreed with the UK government and issued before any bomb was detonated.

Other groups **did** target people.   Including Loyalist Paramilitaries which were often backed and in collusion with the UK government, as well as splinters such as Continuity and Real IRA (Omagh was rIRA iirc).",iyme06

She doesn't tell her husband out of fear of how he would react to the mixed race child from a previous marriage. When he does eventually find out, he simply picks up the child as if it was his own and says something along the lines of ""it hurts that you would think so low of me. let's go inside?"" and that's it. For the late 1800s, early 1900s, that's a pretty strong political statement. 

EDIT: Here's the full line. ...when [Munro's] answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door. ""We can talk about it more comfortably at home,"" said he.

g7ahyyr,"Didn't you say you don't read my comments? lol You are a proven liar so your words are pure nonsense. People didn't correct me they just shared different opinions, this is how arguing works but you couldn't know that because all you have ad hominem. Downvotes don't prove anything, go to another topic see even the people praise Kubrick are downvoted. lol You are still a sheep, still talking about others because you aren't capable of thinking. lol I will forever be remembered? lol Even the people ı argued moved on but you can't because you are a obsessive paedophile who stalks Millie Bobby Brown. I hope you won't hurt her some day because what you are doing isn't normal. You can hurt her or some kid, perhaps you already did. It is clear you have disgusting connection to her this is why you are so ""protective"". Perhaps I should call the cops.",iyme06
g7aixvx,"tl;dr of this thread:

""lol she didn't produce this movie lol you need an education to produce movies lol she's a producer by name only lol"" (disregarding the fact that many successful producers don't have a formal education)

""No, she and her sister are the actual producers. She even owns the production company. You sound jealous.""

""yOu aRe AlL PaEdOpHiLeS!!!""",iyme06
g7akfsx,"Even that many successful producers don't have a formal education they have experience which she doesn't have. I said both education and experience but I guess you have a problem about reading or perception or again lying. Also you are still talking about other people, still waiting for your opinions, don't be a sheep, you can think can't you? lol I just made a complaint to reddit about your paedophilia and obsession. Also I sent an email to her agent that you can be a threat for her. I did my part. Meanwhile keep amusing me parrot. lol",iyme06
g7ancx2,"Man, you're really desperate now aren't you?

""911, what's your emergency?""

""i WaNt To RePoRt A PaEdOpHiLe""

""What happened?""

""hE sAiD i WaS jEaLoUs”

You're really obsessed with paedophilia. After ""lol"" it's the most repeated phrase in this thread so who is the parrot? Sounds like you project your own dirty thoughts, which would explain your mind-boggling jealousy. You're so obsessed with her, so in love and so angry that you start hating her. Classic stalker behaviour.

A normal person would have left it with ""sorry, I just presumed she was not the real producer” but no, you had to continue after being called out. Having no arguments whatsoever you resorted to “you are paedophiles!”. Good job.",iyme06
g7aq9vr,"I am desperate and stalker? lol You project your own dirty thoughts to get away with your sick behavior. Even that some people disagreed with me I have my argument that is her lack of experince and education which I proved. Then you came with no argument just keep saying ""You are Jealous"" and keep stalking me. You are clearly obsessed about  her and now me too because I criticized your celebrity crush. lol You still have no argument after tons of comment. A normal person wouldn't came with ""You are Jealous"" and keep repeating it. You said you don't read my comments but it is clear you are reading. I proved that you a liar countless times but you have no shame. You need help. Get a life untill then you can amuse me.",iyme06
g7awpw1,"You were called out on your misinformation and resorted to ad hominem attacks and threats. Great ""arguments"". That's how this thread went down and everyone can see it.",iyme06
g7az1ub,"Her lack of educatian and experience isn't misinformation, it is a fact which I proved and I said because of that her producer credit is only offical. Some people disagreed and we discussed logically on the other hand you came with no argument, only ad hominem with keep saying ""you are jealous"" and personel attacks. You are still doing it. You still didn't state any argument. You talk about other people or just going for ad hominem. Because of your obsession and lack of argument you are stalking me. I repeat you said you don't read my comments but you still answering it. You are openly lying. Don't you have shame, honour? You started this with a personal attack when other people and I moved on. Your first comment is literally a personal attack, ad hominem, go read it if you forgot. Why do you keep lying? Why are you stalking me? What is wrong with you?",iyme06
g7azia5,Why do you keep commenting? Stop stalking me. You see the problem with that logic?,iyme06
g7b0283,You are literally a moron. YOU STARTED THIS. Your first comment was a personal attack without any argument and you kept doing it. How can you answer me if you don't read my comments? It is proven that you are a pathological liar.,iyme06
g7b1r0e,"The point was that we're replying to each other's comments so no-one is stalking anyone, or we're equally stalking each other. With your logic any thread that contains more than 1 reply is a case of stalking.",iyme06
g7b31yu,"You broke into someone house and when he defended himself nobody would blame him but with your logic you would. Also this is an example unless you miss it again. Your first comment was a personal attack so you started this all I do is defending myself against your personal attacks. Therefore no we aren't equally stalking each other. You are stalking me. Other threads aren't full of people like you who just go for personal attacks. They have argument so with my logic naturally they aren't stalking. Again, how can you answer me if you don't read my comments? Why do you keep lying?",iyme06
