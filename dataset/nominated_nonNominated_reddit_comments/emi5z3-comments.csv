fdpfwez,The trek across No Man's Land was so ridiculously detailed and horrifying.,emi5z3
fdpi5ed,I liked how Mark Strong’s voice was all you heard and the camera starts to show him only from his boots,emi5z3
fdqo1pg,Richard Madden's performance absolutely crushed me in all of two minutes.,emi5z3
fdpsq1e,Rest In Peace to that one guy Schofield knocks down as he sprints through the 2nd battalion at Hindenburg Line since he never gets back up after that.,emi5z3
fdpuihh,How shitty the British trenches were compared to the concrete trench lives of the Germans... was a stark difference in morale to me.,emi5z3
fdxjncg,"“This bloke over here thought it was Tuesday”

fdtki6x,chekhov's milk,emi5z3
fdpmu6z,My favorite shot in the movie was the movie.,emi5z3
fdphzva,"I loved how the movie had these big-name actors in there like Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, but you’d only see them for like a minute. It kinda “un-Hollywooded” it for me. In reality, you really would have only seen these commanding officers for like a minute, whereas in a typical Hollywood war movie you’d stick with them because, well, it’s a big A-lister.",emi5z3
fdpituw,I FELT the desperation of Schofeld when he tries to silence that German soldier by putting his hand on his mouth. Goddamn.,emi5z3
fdpq28g,I’ve never heard an audience groan in unison quite like the hand in the corpse part. I think every person in my completely full theater did all at once.,emi5z3
fdpp7nu,When was the last time that two movies in theaters at the same time would have made as nerve racking a double features as this and Uncut Gems?,emi5z3
fdpi7ek,"I really really really need a 30 or 60 minute making of special on this. I need to see how they did every shot. I know at least once they traded MacKay for a stuntman, probably more, and then snuck him back on the screen later. 

The amount of stuff going on behind the camera, and the actors still being able to deliver has me in fucking awe from a technical perspective. And that's not to mention the performances and how tense the entire movie was.",emi5z3
fdpfqv3,That version of Wayfaring Stranger definitely deserves to win some awards,emi5z3
fdpd9rl,"That scene with the flares in the ruined town will stick with me for a while. Harrowing movie, but fantastic all around.",emi5z3
fdphoec,"Well that really lived up to the hype. I'm absolutely blown away. It keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. 

The standout scene to me was the when the Corporal was at the end of his trip down the river and he goes quickly from floating peacefully among the white cherry blossom petals to desperately crawling over water-logged bodies to get out of the river. 

Besides the obvious amazing work of Mendes and Deakins, huge shout-out to the set and productions designers. To create that massive of a set is simply phenomenal.

10/10",emi5z3
fdpflrn,The shot of Schofield running parallel to the trench while the first wave of troops sprinted toward the enemy was unbelievable. I’d pay full ticket price to watch that sequence alone.,emi5z3
fdqufpm,"I really enjoyed this movie. There was so much I liked about it and so little I disliked. 

Favorite scene had to be when Will first gets on the truck >!after his friend's death, and the other soldiers are laughing and joking as friends. Will is heartbroken and hasnt had time to process everything, and he is just sitting there with an awful look on face, looking like he wants to burst out into tears!< .  Really powerful scene.",emi5z3
fdpkb0q,Loved the small nods to other members of the British Empire! Seeing a few Sikh soldiers as well as Newfoundland being referenced was a nice touch,emi5z3
fdpj5jy,"The sequence where he climbs out the trench and straight up chops for about 300 yds is incredible. Those looked like real hits he was taking when he was running into fellow soldiers.  Reminded me of the Wonder Woman no-mans-land scene (but much, much better).",emi5z3
fdpl7sy,Corporal Blake’s death had me shedding a few tears. They pulled him out of the burning plane the least he could have done was not stab them,emi5z3
fdpck8w,"""Now, fuck off Lance Corporal""

After Schofield went through hell and lost a friend, that had to be crushing to hear. At least the other Blake appreciated the lengths Schofield went through to get to him.

Also, the scene where Schofield woke up during the night and the lights/flares were going off has to be one of Roger Deakins' coolest use of light. He deserves another Oscar just for that sequence alone",emi5z3
fdsrus0,"The ‘Make sure you have witnesses, some men just want the fight’ comment really had me believing that the Colonel would do something rash or ignore orders, even though no sane commander would do that.

Amazing film, extremely tense throughout.  The sense of danger and anxiety was felt throughout the entire movie.",emi5z3
fdr6x18,Dude was on the truck for maybe 100 yards lol,emi5z3
fdpk91h,They did such a great job of humanizing Schofield in the scene with the French woman and the baby. The fire burning created a cozy/safe environment and the tenderness between the two was really well done. He gets his second (or maybe third of fourth at this point) wind by being reminded of his wife and daughter and the departure with her looking up at him begging him to stay was heartbreaking. Maybe my favorite scene,emi5z3
fdpd562,"pacing was great

lighting was amazing

score was good

editing was impressive 

characters and acting were all done well

basically i liked this movie a lot",emi5z3
fdpkutr,"The way Deakins uses light is just absolutely incredible. We've seen a lot of destroyed cities in war movies, but I don't think we've ever seen >!a destroyed city lit only by firelight and fluorescent flares. In a technical sense, it's astonishing and speaks to his mastery of the craft. In an artistic sense, it's supremely disorienting and utterly alien to see something lit like that.!<

After the movie, I was reminded of this scene in Blade Runner 2049 where the whole thing is seemingly lit off of a shallow pool, casting ripples over everything; then he takes it a step further by moving the light around the cast itself to put them in shadow one second, spotlight the next.

Give the man another Oscar.",emi5z3
fdsnq1i,"There were so many ""How the fuck did they do this?"" moments. Like Blake dying in a single take while the colour drained out of his face. My practical brain tells me they used CGI to de-colour his face but it was done so subtly I just loved it.",emi5z3
fdqkddm,"At first I was disappointed that there was a blackout scene, but once I realized it was an excuse for Roger Deakins to shoot at night I immediately forgave the film.",emi5z3
fdpcku3,"And just like that, Roger Deakins gets his second Oscar.",emi5z3
fds5quk,"Mendes and Deakins like ""single take scenes are too easy let's throw a baby in the mix""",emi5z3
fdpe6xc,"If you don't see ""1917"" on the biggest screen in the loudest theater you are doing yourself a huge disservice.",emi5z3
fdpl0gk,That first wave dude Schofield knocked over who just played dead lol,emi5z3
fdpdrqg,"I thought I had some idea of what No Man’s Land may have looked like in my head. Man, was I wrong. 

The bodies sticking out of the ground was horrifying. That, and the eerie lack of music and the camera just zeroed in on our heroes as they navigated hell on earth, was a very sobering scene that will stick with me. 

The whole movie is an amazing depiction as well as a technical achievement.",emi5z3
fdpofs3,"Another thing I loved about this movie is the cherry blossom metaphor. Schofield asks ""are they dead?"" when talking about the chopped down trees and Blake responds ""No, just wait in no time you'll have more trees then ever""

I took this as a metaphor for war and how after many wars the population regrows. Just like how the dead trees gives birth to new life same goes for men.",emi5z3
fdpe9id,It’s at least for sure one of the most *technically* incredible movies I’ve ever seen. I have absolutely no idea how most of this was even filmed. Just incredible.,emi5z3
fdpo3vu,I swear to fucking god if Thomas Newman doesn't finally get his Oscar for this score...,emi5z3
fdpdl1f,"Small detail but I noticed when he went to engage the sniper after crossing the bridge he cycled the action ejecting the spent casing from shooting the pilot.  Insignificant to the movie as a whole but I really appreciate when films get details like that, really does wonders for immersion.",emi5z3
fdpdvnt,"That entire sequence in the burning town was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had watching a film. The colour palette being drenched in nothing but black and orange, the use of shading that really made any hint of light pop out, the music, the camera tracking Schofield running through the town...... all of it was gorgeous and harrowing eye candy. But that slow creep through the window is a moment that will stick in my mind forever.",emi5z3
feaq3jf,"MAJOR SPOILERS  


>!Ugh god, Dean-Charles Chapman totally nailed his death scene. The first cry out of ""wtf are you doing"" to him wincing in pain trying to get his shirt off, and the shaky and defiant ""no"" as he realizes he's been stabbed in the gut.

>!A good, convincing death scene is hard to pull off. Kid is an excellent actor.!<",emi5z3
fdpd21t,The shot of the town on fire was horrifyingly beautiful,emi5z3
fdpe70n,"Everyone in my theater jumped once the rat hit the tripwire, didn’t expect that shit.  Loved the constant terror through the use of Newman’s score.",emi5z3
fdu1oww,"There scene where they all worked together to get the truck unstuck was beautiful. The urgency on Schofield’s face and the quiet understanding of the soldiers around him put the movie back on track to completing the mission

It wasn’t as memorable as other scenes in the movie but that scene specifically had a lot of heart",emi5z3
fdpdmff,Lieutenant Leslie (Andrew Scott) deserves his own movie. It can be part of the 1917 cinematic universe.,emi5z3
fdpsnfb,That shot of him standing in front of the raging fire while the German soldier walked up on him was a thing of beauty. Also Blake dying so early shocked me. Seemed so out of nowhere that it frustrated me. But I'm sure that was the point. I'm sure many a soldier felt that way,emi5z3
fdrn93e,"This movie felt real to me in a way a lot of other war movies aren't. People who go in expecting a Stalingrad/Saving Private Ryan grand narrative are missing the point. 

This film captures a very small slice of an unimaginably complex war from the perspective of 2 grunts on a mission. These guys aren't special forces soldiers or an elite landing party, they're expendable message couriers told only what they need to know and forced to improvise and adapt to a battlefield where the fog of war covers everything and everyone. The vast majority of characters in this movie are busy doing their own thing, contributing to their own seperate slice of the greater effort, and as far as they're concerned the leads are just random dudes.  

Unlike a lot of other ""war is hell"" films, I don't get the feeling that 1917 was glorifying its subject in spite of the message. In the end the MC >!loses his friend!<, almost dies countless times, is verbally abused by the man who he was trying to help, all so he could stop an attack for a day that may or may not commence next morning. He winds up in the exact same spot he was before, >!this time alone!<. No medals, no grand reflection/monologue on the importance of duty or patriotism, just exhaustion and misery.",emi5z3
fdpv1hd,>!Germany loses.!<,emi5z3
fdpn0kt,i cant help but think that the french girl begging with him to stay must have reminded him of leaving his own wife and daughters for what may be the last time they see him. so heartbreaking,emi5z3
fdpjcn6,"After walking out of the movie an hour ago I can't help but feel incredibly moved and sad. I just can't help thinking that even tho this is just a movie made up of producers, sets, lights, and actors that this was set in a time that most of us alive on the planet don't and can't understand. A time where humans killed other humans by the 100 of thousands on orders of men that only wanted to serve their own goals. The movie made me feel for the families that lost sons and daughters who laid down their lives so that we could go on>!(not so dissimilar to how tom died)!<. Truly a spectacular feat in cinematography history in my opinion.",emi5z3
fdt6e40,Andrew Scott had one scene and completely knocked it out of the park. Phenomenal character actor.,emi5z3
fdpj5qf,It’s weird that you can track the whole journey back to the beginning in your mind. All in all it really wasn’t that far. Couldn’t have been more than a few miles.,emi5z3
fdpu3zv,George MacKay probably gives the most underrated performance of this awards season.,emi5z3
fdpq1ox,"After Schofield completed his mission the only comfort he received was from Blake's brother and from the photograph of his family. After this moment of reflection I couldnt help but remember what he said in the beginning,  

""Why did you choose me?""",emi5z3
fdpfofc,I’m glad someone was able to make a movie about my PUBG duo experiences where someone dies in the very beginning leaving the other person to do all the work.,emi5z3
fdudtro,"I found it interesting that besides the one encounter with the German the protagonist must choke, the Germans were seen as faceless shadows. You hear their gunshots, their explosions, and their scurrying, but for the most part, they are the unknown. Even the one he must kill dies in darkness.",emi5z3
fdu4fod,Best scene was the young soldier serenading his mates in the woods before the assault,emi5z3
fdpd0xo,"This movie blew me away. The shot of William running across the battlefield as the music swells,  mortars are blowing up around him, and hundreds of soldiers charge was fucking astounding. God damn I hope Reddit doesn’t turn on this film because I will have to get into so many pointless arguments.

EDIT: as an aside, I’ve seen multiple critics rating this poorly by saying its “irresponsible” to turn war into a spectacle. Did they watch the same fucking movie? There was nothing depicted in this film that made war look like anything less than harrowing",emi5z3
fdr8an8,"The sequence with the barbed wire, the falling, the bumping and the hand into corpse felt like a horrifying vaudeville/chaplin physical comedy routine.",emi5z3
fdykcci,"Blake: Find my brother.

Schofield: How will I know what he looks like?

Blake: Oh, he's the other Game of Thrones actor.",emi5z3

He placed his hand with an open wound into the guts of a person who just had rats in them seconds before...",emi5z3
fefvf97,I thought it was cool how the camera showed us who the actual main character is by following him when they went their separate ways for the first time in the abandoned house.,emi5z3
fdpjgbo,"This movie was incredible. I was really skeptical of seeing the movie for some reason. I think it was because I wasn't familiar with McKay and Chapman as leads and all the big names were cameo roles. But I was way wrong. The sequence with them going through No Man's Land. Holy shit. Running around in the village Ecoust, had to Wikipedia that, at night time? It was like walking around in a post apocalyptic world. Like Schofield was in hell. 

The tension just kept building and building. When they were at the farmhouse it felt like I was in the middle of a horror movie and I was waiting for a German soldier to just pop out from behind a corner. Instead he came from the sky. The second they pulled him out of the plane, I could feel a sense of doom building up in me. I don't know what Blake was thinking trying to save that German soldier, like what were they going to do with him? Tie him up and take him along on the trip. I had a feeling Blake would die since he wasn't in the trailer nearly as much as Schofield. I didn't expect it to happen so early in the film. You don't realize, at least I didn't, that Blake's wound was fatal. Broke my damn heart.

Loved the final sequence with Schofield trying to get to Colonel Mackenzie. It feels like he runs through a 10 mile trench trying to find him as the battle is just beginning. It was a weird comedic moment where Mackenzie, after Schofield saves his life by making him read the letter and withdrawing the attack, tells him to fuck off. He's almost disappointed he didn't get massacred.

Just an incredible film. I haven't seen all of Sam Mendes movies, but I think this is definitely my favorite out of what I have seen.",emi5z3
fdpioj1,"I didn't think a movie could be as stressful as Uncut Gems yet here we are

fdsa39z,Anyone else get a bunch of horror trailers before their showing? Seemed like an odd choice before a movie like this.,emi5z3
fdpjb6h,Anyone else cringe hard when Schofield accidentally put his wounded hand in the dead Jerry? That got a good wince out of me.,emi5z3
fejxtdy,I thought it was a really nice touch having the protagonist not have any personal to the plot. He didn't even want to go. He couldn't care less about medals and the only family he has is waiting for him at home. But when his best friend dies in his arms it's like he had no choice. It was really heartbreaking,emi5z3
fds80pt,The rat hitting the tripwire made me quite literally jump out of my fucking seat. Gotta love that Dolby Digital.,emi5z3
fdpgehw,"Wow, this was simply phenomenal. The score, cinematography, everything was excellent from start to finish. Everyone saying to see it in the biggest, loudest theater you can is absolutely correct. 

Am I the only one who thought Schofield was a Christ metaphor? He gets his hand punctured in the beginning, falls 3 distinctive times(tripwire in the cave, the plane crash, and the stairs with the soldier). He jumps into the river(baptism), then saves hundreds of lives by delivering the message.",emi5z3
fdq0zti,"Man its one thing having learning about how gruesome and horrifying the western front was but experiencing the immersion of being there with these characters is something else man. Phenomenal.

Fellas, this is a terrible date movie. Youll just be thinking about how much you appreciate your boys and how you arent watching them die in front of you.",emi5z3
fejgggp,And then Scofield died three days later from an infected hand wound.,emi5z3
ffpkecj,"A good friend of mine pointed something out immediately after the end that blew my mind and has been driving me crazy the more I think about it: ""The whole movie is a palindrome - everything is the same forwards and backwards""

So, we started going back through the plot to support his theory, and this is what we established so far.

\-Most obvious, the film begins and ends with Schofield asleep by the tree

\-Right after the opening scene, Blake and Schofield are introduced, just as Schofield meets the elder Blake brother just before the ending

\-On the way to meet General Erinmore, the two pass by casualties before winding through the maze of trenches, just as after the meeting with Colonel Mackenzie, Schofield winds through the trenches and out past casualties in triage

\-The meetings with Gen. Erinmore and Col. Mackenzie mirror each other and occur at near identical intervals

\-Blake and Schofield being horrified by the mangled bodies in no man's land but quickly regaining composure - Schofield struggling over the floating corpses in the river before finally breaking down and weeping

\-Schofield nearly suffocating in the rubble from the blast in the dugout, then escaping the collapsing tunnel with Blake = Schofield fleeing from the German soldiers, jumping into and nearly drowning in the river

\-The cherry blossoms in the orchard = the cherry blossoms in the river

\-The German pilot stabbing and killing Blake while Schofield was retrieving water at the farm = Schofield killing the German sentry while his companion was drinking and preoccupied in the town

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm certain there's loads more - some of the matches are major plot points while others are tiny details. We also couldn't come to a consensus where the exact ""center"" of the movie fell, but I'm sure it will be obvious upon watching it again.

tl;dr - I think the film is the same if watched forwards or backwards",emi5z3
fdpr3qq,"That nighttime shot with the flares in the destroyed city was insane. Felt like some kind of dream (or nightmare) sequence. The entire movie was shot beautifully and the “one continuous take” feel pulled me directly into the action and made me afraid to look away for fear I might miss something.

Edit: flares*.",emi5z3

fgr509k,Was haunting seeing the color drain out of the guy's face as he bled to death,emi5z3
fdtkbly,"What an absolutely beautiful film. The scenes in the dark with the blown out city were some of the most beautiful movie scenes I’ve seen.

Also, the death scene with Blake was great. Making him paler and paler leading to his death made it so life like.",emi5z3
fen20x6,"I can't think of a shot that's stuck with me as much as the ruined town at night under flares and fires, it felt like I'd been dropped into a breathing  painting.",emi5z3
feodo7g,"Anyone else think that the French town shot to bits looked like tombstones under the flares? This film was so surreal; there was an almost maddening vibe to it. When Schofield comes to the church and it's in a roaring fire, I had such an unsettling feeling that the fire was somehow alive, lapping at the wood and bodies cast into it, ever hungry, unquenchable. 

Never has war been this dirty on film. Bodies floated down the river like flotsam. Trees stuck jaggedly out of the ground like glass. Blood everywhere. Death everywhere. And for such a grimy, dirty film, my god—those shots. Roger Deakins is a genius. The entire sequence in the French town especially was fantastic, the way the flares shot up into the air, and with each fleeting moment of light, we wanted so desperately to be cast into darkness, to stop the bullets from firing, because not seeing anything was better and safer than seeing something. 

When I saw Schofield look at the tree in the end, I saw ache, pain, and fatigue eat at him. It was inevitable that the film would end where it started, with Schofield lay against the tree, exhausted, wanting so much to lay down to rest, because sooner or later he would be called back into action, and the whole process would start over. What we saw was just a day. A day. And in that short day, many, many humans experienced more torture and toil and tumult and anguish and torment than any person should ever have to deal with. 

What a beautiful, yet terrifying, film.",emi5z3
ff04hw9,This is like the first war movie I've seen that had actual Punjabi soldiers. Nice attention to detail. Kudos to you Mendes.,emi5z3
fdsw95g,"The best moment of the film by far was Schofield crying after he gets out of the river. He was never able to mourn his friend, he nearly died to the sniper, he was chased by multiple Germans, and he had to climb over those civilians in the river. All of those emotions that had been building up were finely let out. I felt that scene and it shook me to my core.",emi5z3
fdroh7m,"Just watched it, loved it.

Two things that I really appreciated:

1) all of the people they came across were the big name actors, I'd never heard of either of the main character actors. Had something of a star wars feel

2) the cinematography was amazing. Id love to know how they managed a lot of these single take tracking shots because they made up the majority of the movie

Also liked the sudden death half way through the movie. In hindsight the trailer did give it away if I'd looked closely at it but I hadn't quite expected it to go that way. Really well done.",emi5z3
ffavac6,I'll never get the look on Schofield's face in the truck scene out of my head the fact that he looked seconds away from bursting into tears and has to listen to a bunch of soldiers talking and laughing while he's in total agony over Blake's death and the soldiers have no idea what's hes been through he never got to bury his best friend and is expected not to dwell on it,emi5z3
fdpm9oz,Robb Stark and Tommen* Baratheon(Lannister) are brothers in this. LOL.,emi5z3

ffdhoq3,"Schofield's run is going to be immortalized in film history. Fifty years from now, when they make montages of iconic scenes from the early 21st century, that scene is guaranteed to be part of that highlight reel.",emi5z3

fdpd0jo,Astonishing piece of filmmaking. See it on the biggest goddamn screen you can find.,emi5z3
fdpda7y,"Just got out, I really loved it. The set designs were incredible, the pacing was great. I don’t know how you pull off that one shot trick across two different trenches. 

Really incredible. 

I thought both main characters were going to have plot armor throughout the film and then they removed that quickly. 

This movie feels like it’s going to stick with me.",emi5z3
fdpi9dc,"I really wish I hadn't seen the trailer for this movie. Almost every single climactic moment within the film was featured in the trailer (the plane, the German upstairs behind the door, the dash across the lines as shells exploded...). If I could do it all again, I would have liked to go in blind.

That being said, fantastic movie! I can't get over how well the technical aspects of this film are. The night scene in the city was particularly haunting and beautifully tense.",emi5z3
fdpcprf,"Just got out and not only do I think it’s the best movie of 2019. I think it’s one of the best movies I’ve ever seen period. I’m just in awe. 

It deserves every technical award imaginable. I have no idea how they pulled this off.

Great performance, great score, great choreography, great cinematography. The scene of Schofield running across the front line to get to Colonel MacKenzie gave me chills down my entire spine the entire time.

Absolutely phenomenal.",emi5z3
fdyqluf,This movie is stressful as fuck,emi5z3
figjbnw,"Finally got to see this Sam Mendes masterpiece and I always appreciate when a war movie highlights the significance and insignificance of individual soldiers in a real life war situation. You go into this movie thinking Tom will defy the odds and get to the General with the message in time, thus becoming a hero. Yet, he dies by a knife wound trying to help a German pilot. No dramatic fight for his life against numerous enemies or becoming the hero in the end, he was simply stabbed and his life was over just like that. Even though Will goes on to complete the heroic act and saves roughly 1600 lives, he is told to fuck off by the General and thus blends back into the thousands of soldiers and will go back to fighting an unwon war. After everything he had gone through and risked his life multiple times in one day, the war is not over, not even close, and he becomes just another story in a 4 year war. In fact, almost all of those 1600 men won’t even know it was thanks to Will that they lived to see another day, and that’s the insignificance of being only one person. What makes this somewhat better is that Will never wanted to be a hero, since he traded his previous medal for a bottle of wine, because that’s all it was- a bit of tin with a ribbon.",emi5z3
flw7r0v,I have never been as distraught as I was when the fucking German stabbed Blake after they helped him out of the plane.  The fucking asshole.,emi5z3
fm64o9e,"I just did a re-watch of the movie and noticed something about the ending.

A lot of people have already mentioned that Schofield was just blown off at the end after all he had went through to save thousands of people. But nobody points out just how much congratulations and appreciation he gets from Blake for being there for his brother and offering to write to his mother about him.

I got the feeling that the entire movie wasn't about duty to your country; it was about duty to the person next to you.",emi5z3
fdpcklr,"As is no surprise to anybody, this movie is really amazing. It's technically brilliant, well acted, a great story, the music was incredible and used so tastefully, really it's got a lot going for it. 

One-shot movies are interesting. Sometimes I'm not sure how the format is anything more than a challenge for everyone involved. It's incredibly impressive, but whether or not it's well done or lends itself to the narrative can be another story. Here, though, it works so well. It's like you're taking a tour of another time, walking through horrors we haven't even seen in photographs. 

First thing I noticed was that the movie moves so well that it's just never boring, despite following the same character with few obvious cuts. The setting would change in seconds, the background felt very alive or very dead depending on what was needed, and we still got great side character performances.

The story is pretty interesting. I mean it's basically Dora the Explorer does WWI. The plot is basically, go through the war zone, through the enemy trenches, towards the coast and through an occupied town. There's more to it than that, but reminding us where we were going and laying it out like that really helped ground us.

This movies greatest strengths, I think, are its depictions of war. From the beginning where the guy cut his hand then accidentally put it through a corpse's wound hole I was like oh fuck we are really in for something. Dead animals, burnt bodies, climbing over floating bodies, trench claustrophobia, it's all really well done and a lot of it isn't even the focus. It's just there and we're just walking through it. 

I couldn't believe the guy with the brother died. What a heartbreaking scene. Knowing that once he knew his brother was involved he couldn't stop going, knowing that he just wanted his mom to know he wasn't scared and alone. That scene caught my by surprise, up until then I had perceived him as the main character. 

What really ties the room together is the ending. He makes it, he delivers the message, but that doesn't mean the war is over or these men won't die at some point. But he did it because it was ordered of him and because he promised his friend. He didn't care about medals, he had a higher honor. And the at the very end when he pulls out the photo and on the back it says ""come back to us"" you realize he was on a larger mission this whole time. Absolutely devastated me. This was just one day in his service. 

9/10. I thought Dunkirk would be the best war movie in a long time, but this one's gonna be really hard to beat. Sam Mendes deserves every best directing award he gets this season 10 times over.

/r/reviewsbyboner",emi5z3
fdt6jnx,"A lot of comments on here praising the night scene for the direction and lighting, and for sure it was incredible, almost otherworldly, but for my money I'm taking the final sequence of Schofield looking for Mackenzie as the best scene of the film. One of the most brilliant and compelling depictions of the implacable war machine in action. Gives a feeling of futility for one one man to try to stop the wheels once they're in motion. The hopelessness of trying to hold back the roiling waters with your finger in the dike.

And then it all culminates in him rushing alongside the trench through a hail of shells and bullets to save the lives of men currently racing past him to their deaths. Just magnificent.",emi5z3

Acting was top notch along with the soundtrack the last 20 minutes were phenomenal 

Benedict's character was right in they will just get ordered to attack the next week as that was when the Arras Offensive started. I had family in that sector at that time in the movie and 29 days after the events of the film 3 sides of my family attacked Bullecourt 20 min walk up from Ecoust (the town in the film) doing what the 2nd Devons were doing.",emi5z3

10/10",emi5z3
fdpkorc,"I saw it about a week ago and I've been itching to talk about it ever since.

First of all, everything being a single take.  I know there were some ""obvious"" cuts (like when it would focus on a rock or a tree would obstruct the view of the characters) but what a goddamn achievement of filmmaking to make this happen.  I was honestly impressed, especially those long walking scenes with a full conversation in the trenches.

The movie is a lot like Dunkirk in that it's just constant tension, and slow movements.  We really don't even see any enemies faces except for the German pilot.  I fucking loved it and it did so well showing the horrors of war.  The slow movement across no man's land, when we weren't sure if the Germans actually retreated, with the corpses, bomb craters, and dead horses everywhere was nerve wracking

And finally, I need to gush about the scene at dawn with the flares.  One of the most insanely gorgeous scenes I've ever watched.  The choreography of the actors / camera / flares, the scene being so tense and well told without dialogue, and then the colors.  The warm sunlight of the early dawn contrasted with the harsh, blinding white of the flares that arced and threw jagged shadows everywhere.  Holy shit I loved every second

Bravo Sam Mendes, bravo.",emi5z3

fe4vtnc,"An utterly mindblowing feature that had me staring in awe at the screen. As a huge film fan, I find it harder and harder to be blown away by a director's craft. Sam Mendes has blown my mind. I was sitting in the theatre in awe wondering how he's made this film. The precision in execution to pull off what is essentially one sweeping scene is insanity. Nothing feels off, he has managed to make the viewer feel as if they are one of the main characters. Roger Deakins's cinematography is the best of his legendary career. Watch this on the biggest screen you can find.

It's not purely a technical feat, *1917* is full of emotion. The performances from Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are superb. These two young men have this huge film resting solely on their shoulders as the two characters who feature extensively. No one has mentioned them in awards talk which is a damn shame. It made me well up thinking about how young these men fighting were and what their families at home had to go through.

War films often make the mistake of being excessively violent and making their characters feel like pawns rather than humans. *1917* is a film fueled by the concept of togetherness. A film with a big heart and a beautiful message. A worthy Best Picture contender.",emi5z3

But a solid movie imo, probably my favorite.",emi5z3
fgfw153,"OK, one issue I have with 1917's plot: There comes a point where the main character, after having lost his partner and gone through hell already, encounters a British troop convoy, and hitches a ride with them for a time.  During which, he informs the commander of that convoy that he's on this dangerous mission, and if he fails, 1600 British troops will be slaughtered, and that his partner has been killed, so he has to complete the mission on his own.

Why did not the commander of the convoy lend one or two of his own soldiers to accompany the protagonist on the mission, rather than simply telling him ""good luck"" to complete the mission on his own?  Am I the only one that has a problem with this part of the plot?",emi5z3
fiolx2z,"Jesus, this movie was something else. It was really disheartening for the majority of the time, with one disaster happening after another and the protagonist rarely ever catching a damn break. It was also fucking nasty (like, I expected it; it's a war film after all) but stuff like Will accidentally placing his hand on a decaying corpse and ending up touching its intestines did catch me off guard and got an audible reaction out of me and several other moviegoers. 

However, all of that also meant that the quiet and tender moments stood out so much more. From Will meeting the French woman and the baby to the soldier singing for everyone and making them forget about their situation for a second, it was really beautiful to see and it gave you that tiny bit of hope you needed.

And then of course, the cinematography, which was the main reason I wanted to catch this movie in theaters - and my god, was it breathtaking. They really made it seem like it was filmed in one shot and it added so much to the viewing experience and constant paranoia. I also never had the feeling like I was missing something. So yeah, I was really impressed with 1917 and it deserves every accolade and praise it gets.",emi5z3

I think everyone would agree that some scenes will stand out for years to come on lists of ""Greatest Movie Moments"" etc. That scene with the flares above the town at night, the church along with the music. The piano score that suddenly chimes in, almost like an eery fantasy film, straight out of Lemony Snicket. 

Absolutely mind-blowing.",emi5z3
ff3ujk6,"Few things:

Blake’s death caught me way off guard. It honestly never occurred to me that he would die. I thought maybe Schofield would die and Blake would get a medal and then not give a shit about it unlike at the beginning. Kind of the whole naive kid is forced to grow up. Genuinely made me tear up though, more than any movie has in recent memory; and my mouth kept twitching, like when you’re trying to keep it together and not sob.

Richard Madden as Blake the Elder was a little weird for me. I can’t not hear him as Scottish. His acting was very good, especially his grief, but there was some cognitive dissonance for me. 

The flares in the town shot, where it zooms in from the arch to Schofield, was literally like a video game. Awesome, in the literal sense.

Oh and Andrew Scott’s character was great. Little bit of dark humor in a dark/grim film.

E: Another thing; I want a release of that version of Wayfaring Stranger. Please.",emi5z3
ff94wsc,"Why do people have such an issue with all the bullets missing him throughout the movie? I'm no war expert but when I picture someone part of infantry that actually survived WWI, isn't that exactly what it must have been like for them? There's way you'd survive infantry without facing gunfire and there certainly were some people that made it through without getting actually hit so how is this such an impossible concept that he was one of the lucky ones? Have yet to read a single ""issue"" with the film from someone who just sounds like they think they're an expert in comparison to all the people that spent all this time working on the film",emi5z3
fgjjdsz,"There is so much symbolism packed into the script, and barely touched on by many reviews. To start with the more obvious things:

\- 6 Apr 1917 was Good Friday, by the way. The connotations are clear, especially in 2nd half of the film; he could have picked whatever other date or not show the exact date at all. But he did, and doubt it is an accident, considering what the entire journey symbolises.

\- the transition from the river to the song scene is a heck of a reference to Dante, and overall a quasi-religious scene in the forest;

\- it all begins and ends under a tree...

\- milk appears before a life is to end soon after, and re-appears at a moment of hope in a new life;

\- cherry blossoms appear again almost symmetrically, before something descends into a hellish situation, and just before somebody emerges from a particular kind of hell into an above mentioned Dante-esque scene;

\- the film completely grinds to a halt in 3 places:  when a friend dies and when a brand new life enters the plot - quite a symmetry again. The 3rd moment is much shorter and only serves as a device for jumping ahead in the timeline, to night time - admittedly used as such by Mendes, to solve the big jump in the objective timeline.

\- the metal box appears after near-death experience, he takes it out, looks in it, puts it back - its contents are only revealed in the very final scene of the film, and it explains some of his motivations that surround that key question MacKay said in an interview:  when you are put through something that pushes you to your mental and psychological limits, what do you return to?

I'm sure there are other clues not noticed in the film, but this list is enough for one evening :)",emi5z3
fdpo9k6,"Just came back, I felt tense the entire movie. I feel like I need a cigarette after watching this.

When the rat set off the tripwire i jumped out of my seat.   
That shot at night after Will wakes up and is running through the demolished town was just visually stunning.   
That shot of Will running across the battlefield towards the end gave me chills, it was just so fucking beautiful.

The fact that, for example they didn't show Lieutenant Leslie's reaction to seeing the flare go up but instead stuck with the boys the entire time really molded the flow of the movie - you were THERE.

ffta0li,"The film is really a dedication  to the craftsmanship and technical achievement of cinema. The characters all seemed very genuine, as many have said in this thread. Was the story unbelievably rich? No. But in reality I do not believe a great war story is suppose to be rich like that. War is putting strangers next to each other and expecting undying loyalty. That is what the plot of this movie is about. That is why the characters seemed so real. They are strangers who are fraternally tied together by hell and country. 

The beginning shots of the two of them traversing “no-mans land” was amazing. It felt like people going through an open air haunted house. Chilling. 

As well, every scene in the town with the flairs acting as lighting was gorgeous. Really impressive work. It all kind of reminded me of “The Revenant,” in the sense that the lighting was all very natural.   The scene with the French girl came off as almost biblical, and was a beautiful small touch. 

Overall great film. Though, I am not certain it was my favorite movie of the year. However, it does deserve all it is getting because it is undeniably great cinema.",emi5z3

Everyone's talking about the camera-work and all that, which is impressive - but the movie had other fantastical technical merits, the score from Thomas Newman I found to be incredibly well made and suited for the story, the sound design was great, the costume and prop department has done a tremendous job (saw it with my friend who's a WW1 fanatic and he said it was spot on) and the set design, they've built some authentic looking sets with fine detail",emi5z3

Really kinda put a damper on the movie for me cause I pretty much knew how it was going to end. Other than that fantastic movie.",emi5z3

What I didn’t expect was how immersed I would be. I just about jumped every time a gun fired. Even when Schofield was supposedly safe, I was on guard because I didn’t know where the next threat would come from.  

It wasn’t just the few cuts, it was the sound design too. I was tense up until the very end, no other movie has done that to me.",emi5z3

fdu1g37,"One thing I really liked was how so much story and character bonding happened in the time and distance elapsed from the cherry trees to the house/barn. Then, when Schofield is riding away in the truck we see the cherry trees and house in the distance. They look so small and meaningless despite the weight of everything that just happened.

Then the trees are gone. The house is gone. And Schofield needs to keep on moving. This movie really sends its characters on a restless oddyssey, and the continuous camera flow helps reinforce an unrelenting forward motion.",emi5z3
fea1xsv,"One scene I absolutely loved was when Schofield was floating in the river, exhausted and nearly passed out, and he sees the cherry blossom leaves fall around him in the water, as if it was a reminder from Blake to find the strength and courage to continue the mission.

Overall a fantastic film.",emi5z3

fi3a6db,"Everything about the film was beautiful - the score, the cinematography, the sets (the trenches were incredible), certain shots like the airplane crash, etc.

But did anyone else feel like there just wasn't enough to the story? I was hoping for something a little more in depth I guess. It felt like a video game speed run, with no side quests or layers to it. I wasn't that attached to any characters.

The first half was excellent but after that it felt rather predictable, especially after Tommen died. You're sort of lead on that Schofield is going to die and Tommen will complete the mission, but after Tommen dies, nothing felt surprising. 

Despite the fact Schofield was running throughout the town infested with German's and getting shot at I didn't feel like he was in any danger, because who would they turn the story over to? I guess that comes with the territory of the continuous shot though.

I liked the movie, but some people in here are acting like it was perfect, which I'm having trouble understanding.",emi5z3
fmk70bm,"It’s pointed out often that the soldier knocked over on the last big charge by Schofield didn’t get up, and it was an unscripted hit. 

I’d like to raise a point that -in a counter effort of maintaining the experience- when faced with extreme or longstanding physical exhaustion and you’re making a final rush/sprint/exertion and you take a fall like that, it’s entirely possible you’re just going to lay there for a bit in all your gear. You’re not bouncing up. Coupled with the terror of actually having to complete the charge, a fall might be a welcomed and temporary “escape” from having to continue forward for some. It doesn’t solve your problem, laying in the grass, but if you’re continually focused on surviving the next three seconds it’s not a bad deal getting plowed over. This is of course not in line with military duty, but rather human terror and survival options.",emi5z3

fel0hob,"Something that I dislike about war movies is how most of the time they end up glorifying war in the end. Yes war is hell but when the credits roll our protagonist survived and became a hero or if he died it was a necessary sacrifice to accomplished a much greater goal.

This is what I really liked in 1917. The friend of the protagonist doesn't have a hero death, while the protagonist accomplished his goal there was still a lot of soldier who were wounded or killed and Benedict Cumberbath speech indicates us that we didn't avoided the bloodbath just postponed it for a few day.

I'm not very convinced by the one-sequence format the idea is interesting but for me the result felt unnatural and artificial.",emi5z3
ffw75b3,"One of my, er, morbidly favorite things about this movie was the attention to detail for the bloated, waterlogged bodies in the river, and how Blake's face gradually became more and more ashen as he bled out.

On that note, I also liked that they went for a more realistic portrayal of death by stabbing and not some fetishized torture-porn disembowelment you'd see in a Nicolas Winding Refn film. At first I thought he would be fine and that the knife only nicked him because he had so many layers on, but then I realized that that's how it can be sometimes: a seemingly insignificant little poke that just happened to hit the right (or wrong) spot and you're dead in a few minutes.

And can we talk about what Thomas Newman did for the soundtrack there? You have this ambient, minimalist music and it just dies the moment Blake does, and it was like an extra hard punch to an already bruised gut.

The production design and music were incredible. The film also did a great job showing just how brutal trench warfare could be. I don't know how anybody won having to cross through all that barbed wire.

As far as the single-take concept, I felt it could've been broken up a bit. While the uncut takes helped make many of the scenes incredibly intense, there were times where I think a wide shot to give context to where we were could have helped. In many cases, we were seeing far less than the actual characters in the film would've been seeing.

The story itself was so-so. Kind of a Saving Private Ryan rip-off. However, similar to Dunkirk, it it meant to be experienced and not really engaged with or dissected. While a movie like Parasite has incredible nuance and layers, with every shot, prop, and movement thought out, a film like 1917 makes up for the lack of these things with sheer spectacle and emotion.",emi5z3

felistk,"It's gonna be tough for me not to gush about this movie. From the acting, to the film making, to the historical accuracy, it was all so, so good.

The Good:

* The acting was exceptional. McKay and Chapman were excellent. And when the whole movie falls on McKay's shoulders, he's more than capable. I thought it was very clever to cast big name actors as the commanding officers. It created an interesting separation between these lower level soldiers and military brass above them.

* The series of oner shots worked perfectly for this story. This was probably the tensest I've felt while watching a movie. The sniper scene gave me that horror movie reaction of 'Don't go in there!' And the oners forced the film makers to create certain sequences that were damn near perfect, like the first cross into No Man's Land, the cave in, the star shells, the run across the battle line. I'll remember those forever. An amazing achievement by Mendes and Deakins.

* The pacing is perfect. The oners create an oppressive, desperate drive to get to the end. Still, the movie finds these moments to slow down and focus on the individuals surviving amidst the war. One of those moments reminded me of a part of Paths of Glory, where the whole movie stops just to listen to a song.

* I love the simplicity of the plot. 'Get from here to there before sunrise or people will die.' Within that simplicity, there's almost an Odyssey-like journey through the strange dichotomies of the war. Not just between superiors and subordinates, but also between the churn of an impersonal war machine and the personal acts of bravery and compassion that occurred despite it. Or how important the mission of these two soldiers is to them, and yet how inconsequential it is to the ultimate resolution of the war. 

The Bad:

* I wish they hadn't advertised the one shot thing. It's technically brilliant and serves the story well, but it's not why anyone should see this movie.

Most heartbreaking scene was probably Blake's death but artistically Scoffield running through the flare-illuminated destroyed city was the best.

fdzdi9n,"Great movie my favorite part was Scholfield drifting down the river looking like he’s gonna pass out but sees the Cherry tree leaves and remembers Blake and the promise he made to finish the mission.


I also really liked how the movie wasn’t about some war winning mission he saved a lot of lives not all of them but who’s to say they don’t get wiped out next week like the Colonel said? It’s about the small victories instead of both the Brothers dying only one of them did. Instead the company dying only half got sent into the grinder. You do what you can, maybe it made a difference in the grand scheme maybe it didn’t but right then and there you won. Thanks to him a lot of people got to live to die another day and are one day closer to home and that means a hell of a lot more than some tin and a ribbon.",emi5z3

ffh50de,"Finally saw it.

Stunning is the first word that comes to mind.

There wasn't a single thing I didn't love about it. In no particular order:

1. I loved every casting choice.
2. I loved the switcharoo of main-characters after act one
3. I loved the cinematography
4. I loved the three big ""wow"" scenes (the tripwire, the plane crash, and the run across the battlefield)
5. I loved the editing*
6. I loved the steady, rhythmic bass that kept the tension going during the scenes where nothing happens but character(s) walking.



*Lee Smith deserves so much recognition for his editing. I imagine that sounds like a joke to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but when you consider the craft that had to be done to make this movie, which featured many cuts, look like it had none, a special bit of recognition is deserved, I think. 

1917 had a lot of little moments where things moved in the frame in such a way that I thought ""I wonder if that's where they cut"" but it happens so often, I knew in the back of my mind they weren't ALL the times the cuts happened. Once I realized it wasn't worth playing ""spot the edit"" I was able to sit back and enjoy the movie. It stopped being a ""look at me"" thing within the first fifteen minutes and by the end I totally forgot it was a ""one shot"" thing.

He wasn't nominated for an Oscar, which is sad.",emi5z3

fev9l1s,"Fantastic film, one of the best technically I've seen. The direction, cinematography, score, lighting were all incredible. Honestly I think it's the best cinematography I've ever seen, you could pause at any moment and it instantly becomes a painting.

That said I was taken out of it at a few points, one the trailer showed all the best parts of the movie. That's not to say the rest of the movie was bad but it lessened the impact of those standout moments. The three things from the trailer ruined were the cave in, when Schofield is getting shot at night after the city was razed and the battle scene at the end. If you hadn't seen those in the trailer it would've left you speechless.

I also didn't understand how after the plane crashed you see two men standing over them and all of a sudden it pans and there's a convoy of 40 people next to them. Then once the bridge was destroyed and he's crossing the water he starts getting shot at but the convoy is instantly gone again. Finally I didn't like how he was communicating with the French lady who was speaking French and they were able to have a complete conversation. If those things were tweaked it would've been a complete film for me.

fh5ckph,"Just watched in prep for the Academy Awards tonight, and while I thought it was good, I don't think it swayed me off Parasite as my Best Picture of choice.  The first hour (up until Blake's death) was super good, super tight and tense, after that the next 45 minutes reallllly slowed down until the final sequence.  I couldn't shake the feeling the entire film that it was almost video game-esque, with a cutscene (the beginning set up with Firth, the mark strong sequence, french woman+baby sequence) breaking up the ""missions"" (getting to the intitial front line, crossing no man's land, going through the german bunker, escaping the city at night, etc).  I had seen it mentioned on this sub that some felt the use of music in some scenes detracted from the tension and I definitely agree, specifically the scene with the sniper.  Anyways I'd probably give it a 7.5 out of ten, the second half just slowed down too much for my tastes.",emi5z3

fg17cnb,"I thought it was an astonishing film. The acting was top drawer, especially from George MacKay, the shooting and editing was stunning (though some joins were actually quite easy to spot though never distracting; it still felt pretty much seamless) and I liked the simplicity of the story Mendes chose to tell. Finally, I found it incredibly moving, particularly >!Blake's death!< and then later >!Schofield's conversation with Blake's brother!<. MacKay absolutely sells the journey to us with a performance I thought was stellar. Very surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor. He was brilliant.

I also really appreciated how it didn't glorify the war (or war in general for that matter) and instead focused on the grimness and harsh reality of what the trench warfare experience would have been like. It felt brutally real and very honest.

I loved it. Gotta call it what it is: a masterpiece.",emi5z3
fdpgvco,"Just fresh out of theater, and if you want a quick thoughts here it is, go see it and if you saw the trailers a while ago don't see them again and for heavens sake avoid the IMDB cast list.

This movie is a very solid 8/10 for me, and it would be 9/10 if it weren't for just a few little pieces for me personally.

**SPOILER**

I really loved that there was no antagonist, nobody was an asshole to both Will and Blake. I was nervous after they got into an argument about why Blake ""chose"" Will but it was a really minor thing that Will probably felt super guilty about afterwards.

The one little thing I was talking about earlier was Will's death and how it happened. After the plane crash that they knew was German they saved the pilot. He had some burns on his legs but otherwise was responsive. Will says ""should we put him out of his misery"" he seemed more experienced than Tom Blake and should have taken the lead and secured the prisoner.

Tom asking Will to fetch some water for a German soldier who was just trying to kill Allied airmen without first securing him seemed a little off to me. Like I said can be ignored, and I did and really enjoy the rest of the movie.

Great choice also to not make it super obvious that Will was a father when he was interacting with the baby and French woman. It was a nice touch.

Finally Benedict Cumberbatch pulled out the heavy guns and got his thin mustache out. Old school fans from his Atonement days will remember how well he plays a villain. But Colonel Mackenzie saw that he was wrong and backed down immediately which is truly admirable but like he said next week is going to be a new order that will get them all killed anyway.

I really loved it!",emi5z3

fdry4v2,"So the plot of the movie is that Tommen needs to save his brother, who happens to be Rob Stark.",emi5z3
fe6ai7e,"The cinematography and direction were absolutely beautiful and the storytelling felt so visceral, but I think my favorite thing about it was the way it took time to really reveal the layers of the main character, Schofield. Blake was lovable and heroic right off the bat, and you instantly feel protective of him. When he dies so senselessly and suddenly, the audience is lurched into a feeling of discomfort and just all-around wrongness. He was supposed to be our hero, what now? The way that the film takes time to reveal Schofield’s true bravery and inner strength, rather than establishing him as a typical hero from the start felt so real and unexpected. Also credit is due to George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman for such strong performances! 

My only complaint is that the big name actors really took me out of it and felt shoehorned in. I understand why they were cast, but their roles were so small that it felt off. 

But this is one of my favorite films of the year, alongside Knives Out and The Lighthouse! I think it will go down as one of the greatest war films of the decade.",emi5z3
fefvzxb,"The shot of Schofield waking back up, the first flare going off and the camera moving out of the window to show Schofield on the street is one of my favorite bits of cinema ever. Just saw the movie a second time and it blew my mind again.",emi5z3
fehpee7,"I like the edits, it kinda felt like a play unraveling. For example the scene where Blake's body is being moved by Schofield and the other two guys, when Mark Strong shows up they walk through the adjacent house and you see trucks, jeeps, dozens more soliders and some even pissing right on the wall the were in front of with Blake's body. Obviously they wouldn't have been \*right there\* in reality because that was like an entire platoon next to where the plane crashed so it just seemed like the stage was changing to the next scene for the play. It was really neat.",emi5z3
feloona,"Loved the bit when Will was running across the battlefield and collided with the extra. I’m pretty sure that was an accident and the guy just stayed down like he was thinking, “I had one fucking job! If I just lay here maybe nobody will notice.”",emi5z3

Absolutely brilliant film, everything from the acting, cinematography and direction. The sort of film that just makes you stop and think after watching it. I’ll be thinking about this for a while yet.

If you haven’t, go see it, it’s remarkable cinema.",emi5z3
fem4hwg,"Man, what a gut-wrenching, nerve-wracking, immersive experience. A lot have already said it, but Deakins deserves the Oscar 110%. That nighttime town scene with the flares felt like a dream sequence. I know this sounds like nitpicking, but was anyone else hoping Scofield would cauterize Blake's wound with the wood from the burning barn? Or toss his previously mentioned grenade into the room with the wounded German instead of trying to shoot him?

I'll also say that I really wish I hadn't seen the trailers for this movie. They showed Scofield's solo charge along the trench during the attack in the very first trailer, and when I thought back to that shot during the film, I was essentially able to piece together what the climax would be. I also correctly guessed that Blake would die early on, since a lot of the scenes in the trailer are just Scofield alone. Still a great experience regardless, but it just bums me out a bit.",emi5z3
ff5opar,"My God the only way I can describe this is film is that it's hauntingly beautiful. Starts with the horror-esqe beginning when their travelling through no man's land to the depressing death of the little brother who was just trying to be a kind human being, to the awe inspiring night light scene, the peaceful forest singing all the way to the heroic race to the captain while the 1st wave getting slaughtered in the background shot. All in one take which adds to the immersion of this film and adds to the film feeling very personal and more smaller in scale  than Iwas expecting, impressive. 

8.8/10. The reaction from the lieutenant about the death of his brother....broke me it just felt so raw in the way he was trying to hold back those tears but has to remain calm because of the position he's in.",emi5z3

The whole journey was amazing, from the beginning shot of him laying against a tree, to the end laying against a tree, the shots taken, the acting. All of it. I was on the edge of my seat full of suspense the whole movie and loved it.

Tom leads the way through the trenches 'cos its his mission and his brother, then they get to the front line and subtly swap places with the vet taking charge. Then when they went over Will kept his rifle pointed forward, hand on the grip, finger on the trigger guard, while Tom was holding his by the stock pointed up.

Scofield's cut up hand that went through so much mud and dirt, then him using those same hands to drink milk from an old bucket, then filling it in his roughed-up canteen, then putting some already fucked-up water in his helmet. Also the conditions in which those wounded were being tended to towards the end.

What an awesome and moving story. To think that all Will got for delivering the message to McKenzie was a “Fuck off”. Not sure if Will could even register that given the shit he went through. You could tell how much the thank you from the major meant to him. 

The environment was also on point - the horror of the gruesome trenches, muddy conditions, traps and barbed wires. Crazy how WW1 is so overlooked in filmmaking even though it was much more brutal with a lot more casualties.

When the plane crashed into the barn I moved back in my seat. Goddamn. The single shot filming made it feel first-person to me, so immersive.

What struck me about this movie was how realistic it felt, and how immersed you felt and how connected you were to the characters. It’s impossible to fully translate to an audience what somebody like Will would be feeling after all of that, and I think this movie did it about as well as could be done. The weariness, depression and sheer exhaustion is palpable. Just an absolute masterclass all around, definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.

I loved how quickly they were able to develop these random characters we met along the way - the salty LT who gives them the flair gun, the sergeant with the cane who gives Schofield a ride, etc. The soldiers in the back of the truck felt especially on point, like if I hopped in the back of an LMTV today I wouldn't be surprised to hear that exact same conversation roll out. All of the minor characters seemed like real people with backstories and personalities. It really felt like there was a whole world that we were just getting a little glimpse of. 

I wonder if it would be as talked-about or how different the experience would be it weren't for the signature cinematography. I saw it with a few friends, and while some of us were blown away by the craftsmanship that went into it the other guys thought it was ""just alright.""

Gorgeously ugly, if that at all makes sense. The detail in the settings as we're taken through them is something else, but they do a great job of not throwing it in your face. No silly zoom ins on skulls or that malarkey.

Another thing I'd like to note about this film is the sound production. In a movie about war it really is a huge part and this film showcases why. The gun fire, the explosions...none of it is dumbed down, and there is no Hollywood feel here. When bullets were skimming across the screen, and debris was falling, I felt like I was there in it. There's one particular gun fight by the set of stairs by the river with the enemy in a nearby window of a ruined house that stood out to me. Brilliant how tense and raw this scene was.

The sets were absolutely incredible. I quickly scrolled through this thread, and didn't see many comments on the set design, which surprised me. No man's land in the first part of the movie took my breath away. The barren, wet, muddy wasteland was paradoxically beautiful to look at for me. The bodies littered everywhere, half buried by the mud in various stages of decomposition was very immersive and the way the movie is made to look like it's done in one shot was superb. Especially in the scene when they have to cross the huge crater and the camera pans over the water filled with debris and bodies while they creep alongside the edge. The sound was also PHENOMENAL. When they're in the German trench system and the rat sets off the trip mine, I literally played that explosion sound over in my head for the next 20 minutes because it was mixed so well. This movie joins the ranks of saving Private Ryan, hacksaw ridge, and fury for me. I will definitely be watching it many more times when it comes to a streaming service. 
My only gripe with the movie, and it's a small one, was when Schofield goes into the building to finish off the German sniper. They shoot each other at the same time, but Schofield gets knocked back and out. When he wakes up, he has no bullet wound. The way the British helmets were designed makes it very unlikely that the helmet could have taken the shot at that angle. Is that actually what happened? Or am I missing something?",emi5z3

But then I got to thinking about it, and I’m glad it gave us the tiny reprieve to breathe while keeping us in Schofield’s perspective before it thrust us back into the horror show.",emi5z3

feju84d,"Love love this film. I barely watch any of the previews so I thought Blake/Tommen was the protagonist. I was expecting him and Schofield to go on a long journey together ala Frodo and Sam with Schofield later sacrificing for him. Nope, Blake dies suddenly and it's now a one man's journey. 

Some of the people here say it has no story, but for me it has more of a story over Dunkirk. At the very least we have more of a protagonist with Schofield. At the start we always get the sense that he's weared and wants to go home, but we also find out he's a capable soldier given how he had a medal that gave off for a bottle of wine. We also see how he avoids distracting himself by reminisicing about his family like Blake. After Blake's death, we see how much it affected him and motivating him to complete his mission. 

And yeah enough can't be said for Roger Deakin's cinematography. This is a movie that needs to be experienced on the big screen. 

Richard Madden sure has bad luck with his siblings....",emi5z3
feywozu,"Thinking about it now I think Scho and Blake are meant to represent one person. Not literally of course, but metaphorically. One still has his humanity, sees the value in every life, and misses home. The other doesn't, he's cold and reluctant, and doesn't see the meaning or value of life at all (illustrated by their argument about the meaning of medals). Although they are so different in those ways they are two sides of the same coin. The very first thing that happens in the movie is the two of them wake up at the exact same time. the use of tree imagery I think is representative of Scho's character, they were asleep in a grove of threes, which given the rest of the imagery I think represents the dynamic between them, and the duality of one metaphorical character they represent. We see the use of the cerry trees at the farm, the are cut down but still in bloom. The broken tree in the way of the convoy, and Scho rallying the other men to get the truck out of the mud in the same scene after overcoming his reluctance to carry out the mission. and then again in the river where the cherry trees are again whole. and we end in virtually the same spot we started, though the tree is now lone as Scho looks at photos from home, signifying that he actually does miss home, and is again whole.",emi5z3
ffpcnk9,"The biggest takeaway when I watch war films like 1917 is that I do not believe I have the courage to do what these men did in WWI and WWII. Honestly, I don’t feel most men and women nowadays have the courage to do what they did. Perhaps their bravery was out of necessity or perhaps it was because they didn’t know any better because the horrors of war weren’t as widely known as they are now.

But when I see bodies being torn apart, limbs and intestines littering the battlefield, random rifle shots pinging off metal or stone inches from their eye, all these things create such a visceral living horror I am in awe of the men who put on their helmet and went over the top.",emi5z3
ffpfnwx,"This film genuinely gave me a panic attack. The one shot gimmick gave you no relief from any part of the movie (much like war) and I felt I had no time to properly breathe. From the flare scene all through to the credit rolling I was shaking and sweating, it was simply too much for me. 10/10. Never watching again. 

Also, the scene with Blake's brother was heartbreaking. There was a moment in Blake's face where he didn't know if he should blame the other guy for his brother's death or not. The range of emotions across his face in those few seconds was devastating.",emi5z3
ffq9yu5,"This is the movie Dunkirk wished it was. It shows exactly how to do subtle character development. I didn't give a single bit of a fuck about any of the characters in Dunkirk.

Dunkirk is just so fucking sterile.",emi5z3
ffqmqc5,"I saw reviews saying how Sam Mendes finally fully sheds his theater background and goes fully cinematic for this one. But I think it still comes through, especially in Blake's death scene. The way he unflinchingly stayed on it and let it play out was masterful and much like a stage play (though I haven't really seen many so I can't be sure).

I think other directors would've cut it way shorter for fear of it feeling too corny or sappy. In that much time, JJ Abrams would've had like 12 more planes crash and suddenly they're surrounded by the full force of the German army and then suddenly a rogue tank appears about to run them all over just as a million bombs drop from the sky and a massive tsunami approaches.",emi5z3

fi5csuy,"Just watched the movie and l loved it. I couldn’t help but find a few analogies with Dante’s divine comedy. These are a few that came to mind:

- The film parallels the first two books of the divine comedy, as Will and Tom’s journey parallels the one of Dante and Virgil. Virgil meets Dante in Limbo and guides him through hell and most of purgatory, as Virgil is not allowed to enter the garden of Eden. Tom similarly meets William in the British trenches, guiding him through no man’s land. After his death, he still “follows” Will through the rest of the journey, as Will keeps his dogtag up until he finally finds Tom’s brother and informs him of his death, fulfilling Tom’s last wish and, metaphorically, letting him go.
- The German pilot falling from the sky represents the fallen angel Lucifer. Just as Dante and Virgilio meet Lucifer at the ninth and last circle of hell, Will and Tom encounter the pilot at the end of their path through no man’s land. Their encounter basically separates purgatory from hell. As the pilot is the first living person they meet after leaving the British trenches (the limbo), the rotting corpses in no man’s land might represent the lost souls in hell, while all living soldiers afterwards might be repenting souls in purgatory.
- Just as Lucifer was trapped waist-deep into ice in the same crater he created after falling from heaven, similarly the pilot was trapped into the plane he himself crashed after losing the dogfight. Also worth nothing is that sinners guilty of treachery are punished in the ninth circle, with Satan being the arch-traitor: fittingly, the pilot treacherously stabs Tom to death after Tom saved his life. As another little detail, the pilot’s uniform consist in a jacket with a large fur collar. Lucifer is also portrayed as a hairy beast in the divine comedy.
- At the end of the movie, the hill where Will rests is an allegory of the Garden of Eden. Beatrix takes the place of Virgil as Dante’s spiritual guide after the two part ways at the gates of the garden. Similarly, now that Will has grieved Tom and fulfilled his oath, he turns at a picture of his wife, taking comfort and solace from the thought of her.
- Some other details that I noticed: The dead dog near the farm might be a reference to cerberus; the french girl and the child might reference to Leah and Rachel, who appear in Dante’s dreams after he enters the seventh terrace of purgatory, which is covered by a wall of flames — just as the French village is in the film.

I’m sure there’s many more details I am missing, and I might need to rewatch the movie — and re-read the divine comedy — to catch them all, but these seemed pretty obvious to me.",emi5z3
fdtsxrs,"Tiny tiny nitpick, but... did anyone else feel that subtitling the French women took away from the realism and the POV of the movie?",emi5z3
fduhl0n,"One of the coolest things in this movie was it didn't have the ""expected"" WWI elements like gas and machine guns. 

It focused more on scouting, booby traps, trench networks, and rifle work. It also showed early mobile troops, foreign born troops, civilian casualties and a lot of other surprising things. I was really impressed.",emi5z3

fpizujx,"Overall I enjoyed the movie and was full immersed into everything going on (with the exception of the German run and shoot at him, or just running and not shooting). >!I definitely didn't expect Lance Corporal Tom Blake to die or at least so early but I thought it was really well done.!<

Highlight of the film imo:

* The ""one shot"" take style as I said before I was full immersed and it was mostly due to the style. I feel like the acting and production work had to be super high quality to achieve it.
* >!I liked that  Captain Smith warned him to have witness' there for reading the letter just in case - it really shows the ruthlessness of some of the higher-ups in the war.!<
* How it really showed the emotional turmoil the soldier would have experienced, through making certain decisions, being in danger, witnessing death and following suicidal orders.
* >!I really liked Lance Corporal William Schofield's interaction with Lauri, showing the humanity of people, (him sharing food, her worried about it being light when he was leaving) him having to leave was rough - (I half wanted him to go find her after he delivered the letter).!<
* >!I also liked what Colonel Mackenzie said about the order just being the same but a week or so late and that he just wanted to finish the war (despite him taking his frustration out on Schofield).!<

Lowlights imo:

* >!Schofield getting shot at by the Germans as they were running and firing from the hip rather than just stopping for a second aiming and shooting him.!<
* >!Last is not definitely an issue but how did he get from the place where he was unconscious to like the middle of a German occupied place??!<",emi5z3
i9mv8yw,"I thought it was really good, the cinematography was gorgeous. The only thing is that I feel like this movie vilifies the Germans a bit too much, if that one German who Schofield tries to keep quiet in the town actually did stay quiet it would have been more interesting",emi5z3
fds7vci,The scene in the transport truck right after Blake died was so numbing to me. We just watched his friend die slowly and then all of a sudden Will is surrounded by these soldiers imitating their officer and joking/making fun of things. I think it’s a pretty powerful part for he movie cuz right before the officer told him not to dwell on it but you can obviously see it’s eating at Will. Then when the soldier tells him he’ll never make it and Will firmly tells him that he will. Just such a powerful series of scenes. 10/10 movie.,emi5z3
ff39cjj,"I wanted to add on top of so many great posts, the one moment I cannot stop thinking of, when Schofield gets out the river and hears the faint sound (so faint) of singing, that soldier (who looked a bit like Blake) singing that beautiful song and all the young boys around just jaw dropped watching...a different world for sure but this scene left me without words and high of emotion...",emi5z3
ffrmotq,"saw it last night, what a remarkable achievement in art. Really can't think of any flaws, besides maybe that I wished they expanded the scene with Will and the woman with the baby. Besides that, it was a flawless, riveting, and bleak portrayal of a dirty war that has been long overshadowed by the many WW2 movies. Loved the themes of the fragility of life, and I also adored how the first and last shots of the film are almost the same",emi5z3

Usually in TV shows or movies that have long shots...you feel so tense and up close and personal to whats happening...and 1917 makes you feel this the whole movie. I loved trying to guess where the cuts were and I would love to know what the official number was. Also...the climax of the movie, the run that was blasted in every trailer...which I had even seen the behind the scenes shot on how they filmed it before seeing this movie and that STILL was one of the most emotional moments of the movie for me with the music and all of what happened leading up to it. It was such a build up. Loved it!",emi5z3

I was tearing up, most likely crying from the moment he ran on the field to him sitting at the tree.

fishal5,The scale of this film was amazing. Especially that massive charge as the camera is backing away.,emi5z3
feg8tqn,"Holy shit.

I was not even prepared for that movie to be *decent*. I went in because I wanted to see a movie that night and it was the only option with a showtime that fit. I really thought it was going to paste an utterly generic story on a thin veneer of WWI scenes, with a single-shot gimmick as its only defining feature. This might be the best movie I've ever seen.

I don't know where to start. There were incredulities and inaccuracies, but the whole thing took on this mythic tone that excused all of that. Little things like the piles of over-sized shell casings from artillery or the ruins lit by flares were at once surreal and 100% a thing that really happened. This shows the reason Tolkien was good: He had seen fantasy made reality.

At some point towards the end, I realized I had no idea what was going to happen next. Would the hero live? Would the attack as a whole be saved from disaster? Would the brother live? Eight possibilities, and I could not pick any one as more likely than any other. Usually if I'm that lost, it's because the narrative has failed and there's nothing coherent left. Finding it combined with a satisfying arc is like exploring the unknown in a luxury liner... polish and novelty don't tend to go together.

The use of dead bodies was incredible. From what I know of the war, that was a huge factor - not just people dying, but the dead staying put, becoming part of the landscape the survivors have to live amongst. Whoever had the job of integrating corpses into the background, of making a leg and a face part of a hillside, can go ahead and retire. They've attained mastery.

The Germans were perfect. They were never mustache-twirling villains, but neither were they fuzzy bunnies... they were just alien, with an alien-ness imposed by circumstance rather than by nature. Identifiable as human but at the same time unreachable.  Ernst Junger wrote about something like that, the mystery of the opposing trench, the combination of your opposing number being more akin to you than your own superiors, but at once a subject of mystery...

The big death scene... again, oh my god. How many deaths have I seen on screen? Hundreds? How have I never seen one broadcast that elegantly, by the deceased just growing more and more pale? I would never have guessed he would be the one to die, let alone so early, but I was so glad to see it happen. The surviving character was by far the more interesting.

The message, for me, came across clear: War is a circumstance. It grows beyond the actions of one nation or another, and becomes not a what but a where. Churchill said something like that... at a certain point, it grows out of human hands. It's like a demon that humans summon into the world, but escapes and destroys us. I don't want to get political, but I saw a thread complaining that the US could not be blamed for Iran shooting down the passenger jet... it can. War is a circumstance. Whoever creates war creates that circumstance, and is guilty of everything that follows.",emi5z3

fho43ft,"I've seen people mention the bad shot sniper, hip shot pursuers, and just general ""lol the Germans sucked"" comments. However, I was under the impression that these were sacrificial, ""meh"" soldiers left behind to slow the British advance enough for the Germans to fall back and prepare. Even the British officer that picks the main character up in the trucks makes reference - ""had to get through a few German stragglers that were distracting enough to slow us down"" (something to that effect).  Hence the drunk German in the town throwing up - I think he knew that they were going to die and couldn't handle it. The sniper, I don't think he was a representation of a proper German sniper. I think he was just left there to serve a purpose, buy time, and ultimately die. I think all the Germans knew it too, which is why they weren't taking their time to properly defend the town, just running/walking around, getting drunk, and shooting like shit. 

Maybe I'm thinking too much into it, but it made a lot of sense to me while I was watching and here I see people in the comments took it a different way.",emi5z3
fdpmmfi,"I think he dies under that tree. Leaving that unknown is brilliant.  People who want a semi happy ending think that he is just resting and will continue on.

Open to interpretation and debate to the optimist and realist.",emi5z3
fdsgex3,"I saw this on opening day in IMAX (I am from the UK, I know it releases on the 24th in the US in IMAX screens) with my Dad. This is one of those movies that you have to see on the biggest screen possible and the best sound system you can find, it really enhances the overall experience. 

Let's dive into the actual contents of the movie by talking about the main draw to the movie, the cinematography and one shot feel to it. This does no way feel like a gimmick just to draw crowds in, but an integral part to the story that really made the movie as good as it was, it would not have worked without the extraordinary camerawork from Roger Deakins (guaranteed Oscar) and his team. Some of the shots in this movie are some of the most creative and beautiful I have ever seen in cinema, a couple of examples include the scene with the flares going up at night in the town and the scene where Schofield is running through the fields perpendicular to wave 1 of the attack in order to deliver the message to the commander. Also, the cuts were not obvious and after about 5 minutes I forgot that there were even cuts in the film due to the polished editing and therefore stopped looking for them.

This movie also contains what I believe to be one of the most under-appreciated actors this awards season, that man being George Mackay, right from the beginning he sells the performance as an irrelevant soldier in WW1 who is forced to go on a mission with his friend Blake. You could feel every ounce of fear, regret, and eventually, pain and determination within his character. dean-Charles Chapman, on the other hand, gives a solid performance but sadly doesn't really get enough time during the movie to truly shine and have a standout until his demise, where he is phenomenal. The collection of well known actors in this movie have about 6 minutes of screen time in total so I cannot really comment on them, however Cumberbatch delivered the only line of the movie that made everyone in my screening erupt in laughter.

One last thing I would like to comment on before I go onto my only negative points of the movie is the score. The score fits perfectly with every moment that it is accompanied with and also fits the mood of the characters very well. One very clear example I can think of is when Schofield is running through the ruins of the town and the Germans are chasing after him, the music slowly builds up to the climax of this scene which is when he jumps into the river below. I firmly believe that Thomas Newman has a very high chance of grabbing that Oscar that he deserves, the only person that could come close to him is Hildur who composed Joker's score.

I have two very minor complaints with the movie that I would like to highlight before I give my overall opinion and score. The first of these being that the scene where the plane crashes right where Schofield and Blake are located is a bit farfetched, I understand tat this segment was integral to the plot for obvious reasons but I just feel as if it comes across as a bit of bad luck rather than a genuine risk. My second nick pick is that the scene with the mother and the rescued baby felt shoehorned in just to add another sad moment to the plot, especially because it was never revisited.

My overall verdict is that it is a must see technological marvel that is almost perfect and I would not be surprised to see this sweep awards at the Oscars, including best picture. My final rating is 9.5/10, I expect this to change slightly change after I have let the movie sunk in and after a rewatch, but for now it is easily my number 1 movie of 2019.

P.S, In MY cinema there was not a single sound apart from people tearing up during many points in the movie, people, including myself, were jaw dropped for most of the flick and at the end there was a huge applause, easily the best movies screening I have ever been to",emi5z3
fdtglc5,"Just got done watching it an hour ago, and wow, just an amazing experience. >!I like how Schofield didn't take Blake's body into the cherry orchard adjacent to that farm.

fduljdz,"Watching this in IMAX was actually insane. Me and my friend literally jumped when the rat set off the trip mine. And we're fucking soldiers lol. Absolutely amazing movie that draws you in and never lets you go. I absolutely lost my shit at the awesome scenes. The suspense of meeting a dark figure in the fog, followed by sheer terror as he gets bayonet charged and shot at? Crazy. Not to mention the horrifying visuals and the awesome charging over the trenches scene at the end. Great movie, we need more WWI shit so people can see war at its literal worst.",emi5z3
fdxjmqx,"I see some people critiquing the lack of character development which I totally understand, but i actually kind of like that aspect.

We spend like a day in the life of this guy, and while I'm sure these events will change him and there are subtle hints that everything he went thought will stick with him and likely give a new perspective about family and friendship. But, I like that it really was about the hellscape mission, and there wasn't some wedged in overcoming personal demons arc that he finally learns to overcome adversity and save the day.

The war is hell theme is nothing new, but it was just done very well here. Feeling like you were right along side him step by step just felt immersive and realistic. And I think taking too much time for too much character growth may have actually taken away from that.",emi5z3
fdymlr4,"I love the fact that the movie had the balls to kill off one of its majn protagonists. His death this early on in the movie basically told us, ""Hey, this is WW1. There is reality, and there's no plot armor here.""

fe6fzdb,"I was literally on the edge of my seat from the majority of the film. My only issue was that marketing made it pretty obvious to me that Tom Blake wasn't going to make it (so many trailer scenes showing only Schofield), but even that wasn't the biggest deal. 

I like that Cumberbatch's character was less the head strong general he was foreshadowed to be, and more a weary man frustrated with war. A very topical movie with some so quick to beat the drum of violent conflict again. 

Cinematography is what people are going to remember this movie for, so I'll be shocked if it's not the favorite at the Oscars for that, and will certainly give Best Director a run for its money.",emi5z3

From a technical standpoint, the movie is a gem. Great acting too with a score that fits perfectly.

I think if The Lighthouse doesn't win Best Cinematography, it could easily go to Deakins. The scene of the flares behind the city ruins AND Schofield standing in front of the building in flames are just incredible shots. Top 5 of the year for me.",emi5z3
fekxt53,"I feel like Schofield blamed himself for Blake's death when he was sitting in the truck while the other soldiers where joking and laughing because if he hadn't left Blake alone with the German pilot or if he had either shot or disarmed said pilot his best friend would still be alive 

Also when Schofield breaks down in tears after climbing over the dead bodies while trying to get out of the river was heartbreaking because the last few hours or so was hell he was almost killed multiple times his best friend died right before his eyes and he never got a chance to properly grieve  over Blake's death and the knowledge that he would have to tell his best friend's older brother that his baby brother was killed",emi5z3

- Felt like they wanted to capture the gruesome reality of WW1, but didn’t quite lean in all the way. Idk, there were certainly some brutal shots (no mans land, the river bodies, final medical tent), but it still didn’t feel like they quite captured just how soul crushing trench warfare was.
- The panning / long shots stole the show, sometimes in a good way other times in a not so good way. It also created some pacing issues IMO. The scope of the setting felt small because the camera sees everything.
- Some really strong dialogue. I thought Cumberbatch did a great job capturing the complex motivations of his character in such a short scene.",emi5z3

fecvj5d,"I adored this movie. It’s one of my favorites from 2019, and I only wish I’d seen it sooner. It’s engaging, disturbing, thrilling, horrifying, depressing, and probably a hundred other emotions. I was not expecting his friend to die that soon, and I was completely heartbroken when he did. It felt realistic for him to die just like that, but I really wanted him to stick around for longer. He was really likable. Also, what-day-is-it dude was fantastic for the short amount of screen time he had. I liked a lot of the supporting characters here, and they felt like genuine, real people. 

9/10. Also, I haven’t seen anyone talk about this yet. They were trying to *save* the German when his plane crashed? I was a little bit surprised by that, but it really cemented in my mind that these are good people, and how awful it was that they were forced to fight this war.",emi5z3

feh0r3e,"Just saw this movie and loved it. I liked how it 'subverted expectations' in a subtle and constructive way. Three examples -

(1) The injury to Schofield's hand (follow by him plunging it into a corpse) - I thought for sure this would lead to infection and/or complications later on, but nope, bandage it, move on, never mentioned again.

(2) The German airman and the young German soldier - in both cases I thought we'd be treated to a moment of positive interaction to ram home the theme that there are good people on both sides and war is hell but morally complicated (this seems to happen a lot in WW1 dramas). But again, no, shit's nasty, it's a war, and you shouldn't be surprised when your enemy tries to kill you.

(3) The Colonel - there's a scene where Schofield is told that when he gives the general's message to the colonel he should ensure there are witnesses. I was *sure* that this would lead to a nasty confrontation at the end in which the colonel doesn't heed the general's message, but no, he's a good officer, he stands down the attack once he reads the letter.

I hesitate to call this subverting expectations, exactly. Nor are these red herrings. It's more like a subversion of Chekhov's Gun - sometimes (as in real life) things that could easily be significant later on don't actually turn out to be significant.",emi5z3

There were a few obvious cuts between shots, but it still was supremely well done and noticing a few cuts didn'ttake away from it at all for me. The lighting during the nighttime scenes in the ruined town was amazing too. While the plot was quite simple, that doesn't take away from the technical achievement of the film nor does it diminish how good the cast were.

I did find it slightly amusing that the guy who played Tommen in Gane of Thrones said the guy who played Robb Stark looked just like him but older, given that they're from two families that have very distinct looks in ASOIAF. That's neither hear nor there, but I did have a slightly inappropriate chuckle when Richard Madden appeared. He killed it in his brief appearance though.",emi5z3

The British soldiers on the truck were talking about how the Germans killed all the cows so they wouldn't be able to eat them, but clearly there was a German soldier with enough heart to just keep that one cow alive.

From a technical aspect, it's an incredibly well-made film. Specifically, the sequence where Scofield is running through the town after waking up with the flares lighting the town up was an absolute delight to watch on the big screen.

A nitpick was that I felt like the whole sequence of a soldier meeting a local woman in war and them inspiring and indirectly reminding the soldier to do his duty feels a bit antiquated at this point. That being said, it was still a sequence that was executed well and fits in with the time period being depicted.

I kept thinking about Dunkirk when I was watching the film and in all honesty, I actually enjoyed Dunkirk a bit more because of how unorthodox it was relative to 1917.",emi5z3

I felt like I'd gone through hell with these guys. I felt like i was in the trenches . i think thats laregly due to the camera work. Youre down in the mud with them. The one take thing didnt feel gimmicky to me at all. It felt natural and i didnt really think about it.

 The production design is amazing. Theres so much to take in in every scene. My eyes were always wandering. Im sure a second viewing would be intensely rewarding. And that ending run ... Wow. You know how sometimes you watch a scary movie and then you have trouble sleeping at night ? That's how i felt going to bed. I was having anxiety at the thought of having to be in those trenches.

The sound was amazing. Even when in the midst of a gun fight i knew was happening, every gunshot made me jump out of my seat. It was so well done.

Finally i think richard maddens scene at the end may have been the best acting ive seen in recent memory. According to imdb trivia that was the first take too. There are a lot of scenes i just keep thinking about. The soldier singing as he comes out of the river. The truck stuck in the mud. Etc. Yeah i think this may be an all time great here.",emi5z3

The trip wire scene and the sniper in the tower were both brilliant moments of tension that will probably be studied to no end. But the trench run at the end was just something else. I had goosebumps during that scene, one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had in a theatre.

Although I did feel that it hit all the major war movie tropes and on the basis of its screenplay it misses out on being the best movie of the year for me, given that it has been an incredible year for cinema as well. But as a cinematic experience boy was it a wonder to behold!",emi5z3

fe0f7g2,"The suspense was riveting. It was a technical feast as well. Overall just a great portrayal of the brutality of WWI and just how far those men had to go through the wringer just to see another day. 

I think the film’s purpose wasn’t so much about telling any story as it was allowing the audience to be a fly on the wall, or in this case, the field and trenches. It was a heroic adventure but it was likely just like any other day during the war. Which is the toughest part to swallow.",emi5z3

fe6ibl9,"I felt really nostalgic watching the scene in the burning French village, when Schofield first wakes up and sees the flares illuminating the light sky paired with Thomas Newman's amazing score. It hearkened back to the days of grand orchestral scores like with John Williams and LOTR, where there would just be these absolute beautiful sequences on screen in perfect harmony with the masterful compositions that only heightens the emotions of the viewers. To the point of being conjoined, you cannot imagine one without the other. I may be in the minority, but I feel like that style of film-making has just been lacking as of late in movies. We've had some good scores from obviously Hans Zimmer as well as others like Ramin Djawadi, but imo they're just missing something when it comes to on screen music. The word I'm looking for here is **magic,** and I finally found that in this movie.",emi5z3

there was another example but I can't think of it now

also want to point out how scho actually runs into two extras when he's doing the epic run down the battlefield, one 'dies' as many on this thread have joked about, the other guy picks up his helmet and is promptly shelled

when he's crossing the bridge and the sniper opens up at him (thank goodness the sniper can't hit a man tiptoeing across a bridge), he reaches the other side and jumps down into cover, below the bridge embankment.  Now, given he is carrying a **priceless message that will save thousands of lives**, shouldn't he just **hightail it the other way and get out of range and avoid the sniper completely?**  Instead of, you know, approaching the building and engaging in a highly risky duel ending with going into the room he knows the sniper is in and nearly getting his head blown off?

fdplc01," Artistically it's perfect. Roger Deakins deserves another oscar for this movie because he's a master of the craft.

Story wise, I don't know how to feel. It definitely had some tense scenes and emotional points but overall I just felt meh towards it. Part of me feels like the story was a means to showcase impressive cinematography rather than the other way around. I just wasn't wowed by it. I also felt a lot more tension and dread up until Blake's death. After that a lot of the tension and sense of danger was gone when enemies were doing stormtrooper levels of dumb fighting.

I also felt like this movie suffered from its trailer. It gave away all the awesome shots and the main song of the movie and it didn't hit me as hard when those scenes actually came up.

Overall I still enjoyed the movie albeit mostly from a cinematography standpoint, but if I had to give a ranking of the most recent war movie greats it would probably go Saving Private Ryan(10)>Hacksaw Ridge(9)>1917(8)=Dunkirk(8)",emi5z3

fds9gwf,"I felt absolutely out of breath by the end of the film; it's a chaotic, hopeless, and exhausting story well worth your time and money. What sets it apart from other war films is its approach to telling the tale not as a high-flying action movie, but as a thriller. I couldn't stop wincing when the two first go over the top and enter no-man's land, hands and feet stumbling through bloated, mangled corpses, mountains of barbed wire, and watery shell craters, especially knowing how infected Schofield's hand would become after gouging it on the wire. It was almost a callback to when Sam and Frodo traverse the dead marshes in the Two Towers. 

In spite of the lack of exposition of their friendship, >!Blake's death was still powerful and upsetting. Whether or not he had accepted his fate upon taking up the journey didn't matter, the fear and disbelief of confronting his own mortality overtook him all the same. This was a big gut punch that I did not anticipate, but I admire the risk Mendes' took here to further narrow the focus and subvert audience expectations.!<

I found it to be wonderfully immersive thanks to the sets, score, sound design, costumes, dialogue, and pacing. It was breathless from start to finish. I wasn't too bothered by Firth or Cumberbatch's cameos, though I equally wouldn't be bothered had they been cast differently. 

But in the end, the film's greatest success is in visually and thematically paring down the scope of the conflict, along with all its misery and tragedy, into a snapshot of a few hours and in reminding the viewer in the end that indeed, this story is but a page in the tome of war.",emi5z3

Everyone has mentioned the technical achievements (and they're great!) but I also think the script is really good. It's never predictable, and suspenseful until the end. Then the end is just anticlimactic, but in a good way. It shows how meaningless war is. Schofield went through hell, and in the end no one thanked him, asked him how he was doing, or even really noticed what he did. And even we as an audience wonder if there was any meaning to it. Were these 1600 men saved, or will they die tomorrow or the day after that? We don't know.",emi5z3

I wonder if Hollywood has figured they can’t make a traditional prestige war film anymore because they’ve been done so frequently, so they have to come up with a twist to make it fresh. I’m on the fence about the one shot idea. I get why it was done, but I noticed so many of the hidden cuts and each time I was taken out of it. Maybe upon repeat viewings it won’t bother me as much.

I think the closest movie to compare 1917 with is Dunkirk. Both are war movies with a clock counting down. I felt like Dunkirk had a bit more urgency to the story and that might be because of the score. I also had a bit more of a visceral reaction to the ending of Dunkirk.

My biggest complain is probably that, while I adored the music itself, I thought the movie relied on it way too much, kind of ruining moments that would've been a lot better had it been just the ambient sound. The scene with Schofield running along the trench while the attack was starting was breathtaking, though.

Besides the obvious props to Deakins and Mendes I really wanna commend the production design department, the sets were beautifully horrifying, the scene of them going through no man's land with the corpse floating in the ""lake"" with the crow on top, just wow.

Favorite scene was probably the scene with the soldier singing *Wayfaring Stranger* just before the attack. In a movie with stuff as great as the whole sequence in the town at night it really stood out to me, the actor had a chill-inducing voice, and those really sad lyrics being sung while we're shown these kids who're risking their lives for a stupid war... man.",emi5z3

fhypaws,"I realize I'm a little late, but I just saw 1917 and the cinematography blew me away. That whole sequence where he's running through the ruins lit by flares and flames with the shifting shadows was amazing.

The transition from orange to blue when he left the town felt a bit awkward to me, but oh well. The other thing that slightly bugged me was when the two guards outside the Colonel's bunker just sorta disappeared when they became inconvenient to the plot. Also not sure why homeboy played with his bolt so much. Was that just nerves? We saw unspent rounds eject when he did it, so I'm assuming it was intentional. Speaking of playing with his bolt, I was the only one in my theater who laughed at the line about how they'll patch his hand up and he'll be wanking again in no time",emi5z3

ff2fg52,"Jumped like three feet when that tripwire went off. 

As a history buff, this is just a fantastic movie to experience. I loved how because the entire film is made to look like a single shot, the main characters have no escape from the situations they’re in. The fact that there’s no cuts even when the main characters get into sticky situations, we get to see them dealing with the aftermath of having to move on or deal with the crap that they find themselves in. 

To those who say it didn’t have much of a story, what would you have instead? To add anything much more to this movie would be unnecessary. 

I was kind of disappointed that there was nothing to humanize the Germans except for a single abandoned photo of someone’s family. Although this might be because this is later in the war and the honorable sentiments that people had in the beginning might have worn off by 1917. But still, it kinda rubs me the wrong way that every action from the German soldiers, and even the injured pilot, was done to try and kill the main characters. We’re not talking about Nazis after all.

Also I was really hoping to see a hellish artillery barrage, but I understand that an hours long barrage wouldn’t fit into the plot.",emi5z3
fdpdcwe,Advice to fellow quiet theater lovers: catch a late show after all the boomers have gone to bed,emi5z3
fdpm8ln,one thing i appreciate about this film is it shows mainly the aftermath of battle. only rare moments of violence occur towards others. it's mainly the decay and destruction that we see. none of the 'glorious' battle that hollywood typically romanticizes that leaves behind such wreckage,emi5z3

fdpy5fi,"Truth be told.. it's every bit as enthralling and compelling as you'd expect a high-octane war drama to be.




 The score perfectly complemented the situations onscreen: It could range from solemn & earnest (noticeable in the main motif) to distressing and harrowing within minutes.  
 The visuals are exceptional: Deakins made nearly every shot as cinematic and appealing as possible.  Some of the standout shots were the flairs in the air at the city ruins, Schofield facing the large cross near the burning building & the walk towards the large tree at the end.   Frames throughout almost felt like paintings.
 The viewer just gets sucked into the chaotic (sometimes traumatizing) whirlwind that is war.



All in all, you're left with a powerful concoction of immersive action, compelling drama & possibly even a belief that persistence can be a strong driving force to accomplish even the most daunting of tasks in almost impossible situations.",emi5z3

That scene where an almost operatic score is hitting us as Scofield runs through flare lit ruins as bullets ricochet and he scrambles and runs for his life was breathtaking and a genuinely brand new cinematic moment for me. Everything else has been done before to varying degrees of skill but this was cinema as art.  I was speaking to my mate afterwards about how great it was to see something new and unseen like that scene and he just shrugged and said the whole film was meh and he was bored. 

Was a great film and the second film in a row that had me in tears (last week it was JoJo Rabbit).",emi5z3

Despite so few lines or obvious exposition, they really fleshed out the main character too. Props to the actor and the writers on that.",emi5z3

I love that everything is shot at chest height to give a feeling of grandeur and everything feels like it is down hill.

Amazing acting from everyone in it.

Amazing cinematography.

I also love that it feels like time and space are compressed, as in everything is so close and things happen so quickly.",emi5z3
feb8yit,"Phenomenal experience that shouldn't be missed on the big screen or with a really good theatre system in-home. Extremely harrowing and wonderfully acted. My only gripe is, to me, that it really does feel like an experiment very light on plot or any real plot beats that occur throughout the film which might hurt rewatchability. The first go will be amazing but I'm unsure about a second. Great work from Sam Mendes. Great score also!",emi5z3

feg63eq,"I feel I need to particularly praise the set design. All of the trenches were unique and had a different personality and the orchard and desecrated town almost had a life of their own. Really heightened tension knowing there was an entire new environment you would have to handle and become familiar with.

 It almost felt like a video game where each new part was like a new level and a harder obstacle to traverse. Even the truck, french woman, flair scene etc were like cut scenes. 

The tracking and attention to the setting really immersed you into their horrifying adventure amongst all of the general technical brilliance. Almost seemed like a war horror/suspense film as well which kept it pretty fresh. Great film",emi5z3

femb6gm,"Wanted to share something a veteran wrote about WWI, that the movie really reminded me of. This is from the intro to Ernst Junger's ""Storm of Steel""

""It is not impossible that among the English readers of this book there may be one who in 1915 and 1916 was in one of those trenches that were woven like a web among the ruins of Monchy-au-Bois. In that case, he had opposite him at that time the 73rd Hannoverian Fusiliers, who wear as their distinctive badge a bassard with ""Gibraltar"" inscribed on it in gold, in memory of the defense of that fortress under General Elliot; for this, besides Waterloo, has its place in the regiments history.

...I daresay this reader remembers, too, the white tom-cat, lamed in one foot by a stray bullet, who had his headquarters in No-man's-land. He used often to pay me a visit at night in my dugout. This creature, the sole living being that was on visiting terms with both sides, always made on me an impression of extreme mystery. This charm of mystery which lay over all that belonged to the other side, to that danger zone full of unseen figures, is one of the strongest impressions the war has left with me.

...Indeed, the landscape in which we lived at that time had something about it of primeval Africa, with two mighty forces of nature locked in conflict there. It was only now and again that one caught sight of a brownish-yellow fleeting shadow against the desolate countryside that stretched on and on before one's eyes; or heard, after creeping through the wire at night, a whisper or cough from a post. The sound of a transport, a cloud of smoke from a fire hidden from view, fresh chalk spoil thrown out on the tortured ground, the monotonous duel of the guns stretching on from week to month - those were signs we puzzled over as though they were the runes of a secret book or the spoor of some mighty and unknown beast that had come nightly to drink.

As time went on, it grew more and more dangerous to lift a corner of the veil that fell like a magic hood over the spectre that was at once so near and so fatally far off. Raids undertaken to get a glimpse of the enemy's lines and some information about what was going on there became less frequent and more exacting as the volume and mass of war material increased. A more and more terrific barrage had to be put down before ten or twenty picked men, armed to the teeth, could make their occasional and exceedingly brief appearances in the opposing trenches. What the survivors brought back with them the memory of a rapid and frantic glance into Vulcan's white-hot cauldron.""",emi5z3
feuylxi,"Amazing movie.

I'm a big fan of the continuous filming style, it reminds me of playing a videogame where you witness everything from the character's point of view in real time during that particular adventure. But also, the effect is that you are intimately close to what the characters are going through.

From technical point of view, its a perfect example of continuous style filming and will be copied some more just like this film copied others before it, but this film has executed it near flawlessly.

&#x200B;

Dialogue wise, it is top notch... realistic even considering the characters backgrounds and motivations.

&#x200B;

Acting performances were great.

&#x200B;

One scene I was concerned for a second was the scene where it looked like romance was in the air but that was quickly disintegrated and my worry was removed.

ff2r8uj,"A beautifully shot film. The subtle character development made me personally quite invested in the characters. I very much enjoyed the use of the wide angle no-cut scenes, it offered a unique perspective of the character's harrowing surroundings and also the never ending intensity of moving through a warzone. I was however taken out of the movie when they used objects to merge two scenes together. Of course this is a pioneer effort so it's rather just something I noticed than something I hated.

We were both blown away by how well the front was portrayed - right from the first scene, when we saw the wraps on their legs. Every detail felt like it could've come out of the documentary and we noticed and appreciated those details that we might have otherwise not given any attention to having recently watched the documentary. 

Also, the story was a great ride - basically a simple get from point A to point B but compelling in its execution and as a sheer spectacle.

Bravo.",emi5z3
fg347kw,I was initially looking forward to how the two main characters would be fleshed out and was very hooked... until the brother got murked. The well-known by now impressive cinematography and one-shot technique along with the satisfyingly accurate settings and costumes weren't enough to distract from the constant overbearing war movie cliches and the remaining bland main character (who finally got fleshed out at the very end of the movie???). I will say that 1917 did grab me one last time towards the end with an awe-inspiring missile fueled setpiece and how climactic a letter of General's Orders were. And any scene set during a dark blue morning sky was always gonna win me over.,emi5z3

Her maternal instinct extends past who she knows. And schofield's paternal instinct as well. And he had the milk, oh god.

And she begs him to stay, to wait till its safe, and he can't, he has to go. The fire, the woman and the child, a parallel to every soldier who leaves because duty calls, and his likely death once he/any one of us leave.

Blake for sure seemed like the stronger presence, and there was already an ending there with him reaching and meeting his brother and even maybe dying in his arms, and also a character arc dying to be explored with him learning not to be so impulsive. Definitely a bold choice and I think the right one. Showed us the unpredictability and heaviness of the situation.",emi5z3

fdtzz1j,"I've never been in a movie that seemed so 5 dimensional. When he's in the water, I felt the cold. When they're breathing vapor in the trench, I felt the chill in my own hands. When they're sliding in the mud, I felt the weight of the mud, my own feet sliding. When he's getting shot at in the river, I felt the fear. 

This is some of the best filmmaking I've ever seen. I still think Saving Private Ryan is a more cohesive package, and a better war movie (the tanks coming in from a distance before the final fight is still something that unnerves me to this day), but this is definitely up among the best.

One last remark: the scene with the whimsical, yet dangerous, fairy-esque, Lord of the Rings-style music when he wakes up and goes into the city at night, with the flares, right up until he enters the cellar, is easily among the top 5 best scenes of any movie I've ever seen. It was haunting, beautiful, insanely choreographed.

The second half, that's the Roger Deakins I came to see, and holy shit was it beautiful. Everything shot at nighttime was perfect, it just looked gorgeous.

But to circle back to that first half... if they ever make a movie based on The Last Of Us, they'd do well to take notes from the first half of this movie. Two people inching their way through dangerous territory, abandoned locations, trying to figure out what happened here, unsure whether death lurks around the next corner, where any encounter carries the real threat of pain & murder. I got a lot of TLoU vibes throughout. I actually expected them to lean against a tree and sleep, then hard-cut to night, like Joel does early in the game.",emi5z3

To be fair, at one point I started to feel like the other elements of the movie, particularly the acting and character development, were being sacrificed for the direction, but by the end I didn’t think so anymore. 

Cinematography is marvelous. The night sequence is hauntingly beautiful (reminded me a bit of Fury Road, in the glorious combination of bright colors).

I loved how I automatically thought Scofield, who started out as the sidekick, would die early. Instead it was the supposed protagonist that died out of nowhere, and the sidekick embarked on a bit of a condensed hero’s journey. In retrospect, the focus was indeed on him all along, but I’d assumed it would be one of those minor roles that “steal the scene” from the main actor.

I know the lack of apparent editing makes it strange but we heard absolutely no sound from the arriving British until a minute later when they were not 25 feet away.",emi5z3
fe6ouwm,"The movie is excellent. What I like about it shows the horrors of war but seeing it in backgrounds like dead bodies in rivers or trenches — seeing soldiers being tired of all this war. It never feels preachy but shows a nuance in the background. 

The film is intense, like when two main characters wherein the German trench, and the rat triggered the explosive — I kind of gasp when that happened. 

My favorite scene is probably when the main lead meets a French woman, and she is taking care of the baby isn't hers. It is heartbreaking, but it is joyful seeing the main lead interacting with them at the same time. 

The plot is simple, but very affected delivery is a message about the war is terrible and very entertaining at the same time.",emi5z3

fe8r3rs,"One of the things I love most is just how well the 2 characters complement each other.  Blake is clearly the more headstrong and brave.  He takes the assignment without question and leaves without another thought.  Schofield is more trepidatious and strategic.  ""Check the trees"".  Making sure Blake is aware of his surroundings.   

Then you see Blake save Schofield's life by taking action.  The same selfless bravery and willpower we see in the beginning.  Just writing this makes me well up.  On the flipside, if it had been Schofield tending to that German soldier, he would have at the very least checked him for weapons first.  

Lastly, we see Schofield quietly contemplating his family and his home as he enjoys what might only be a moment of peace and sunshine.  

I also thought Richard Madden did an excellent job with such limited screen time.  My heart broke for him too.

Lee Smith's editing to make it look like a single cut was genius and it never felt gimmicky but essential to the experience. The screenplay was a little lacking and could have developed the relationship between the two leads more, sometimes when I felt like staying with the scenery, the movie moved on, ofcourse it was intentional but it did affect my experience, all in all just minor nitpicks, it was a great film.

fkjjafw,"half way through it became a bit too convenient, felt bit like A to B ever since he got picked up by the other company in that derelict farm, he smashed a random door to basement that leads to that lady and baby and when he jumped into the river, I knew its going to carry him all the way to where he wants to be, but apart from these, the long shots are amazing, I don't recall any break except that blackout, its a technical marvel, blew me away the same way Children of Men did to me, overall I think its a solid war movie, nothing stands out too much but kept you at the edge of the seat throughout, although, that basement scene looks like a obvious plot device, I actually liked it, it eased the pace quite comfortably.

The scene where he lurks into the camp where a soldier is singing- I thought it was perhaps the most immersive scene in the entire film.

fhddmbs,"What a masterful movie, I really can’t praise it enough, many of you on this thread have done it much more eloquently than I possibly could have. That No Man’s Land scene will forever stay with me. 

I only have one personal complaint, and that is that we did not get an honest to goodness battle scene. I understand that this is not what the movie was trying to do, but as a WWI nerd, I’ve always wanted a movie that depicts a battle from this period to rival Saving Private Ryan. I thought I’d finally get that in this movie, who knows when we’ll ever get another big budget WWI movie.

Truly fascinating.",emi5z3
fdqkszd,"Phenomenal film. It’s probably my pick for Best Picture. The combat scenes were harrowing and breathtaking in scope. 


I think my favorite shot was the one of the protagonist sprinting down the trench line as the wave of troops charged into No Man’s Land. It felt like I was there, experiencing the utter chaos and confusion of the battle.


I also was unexpectedly touched by Lance Cpl. Blake’s death scene. I didn’t anticipate such an intimate and human scene in a film like this. 


All things considered, I give it a strong 9.5/10, and I look forward to seeing it again in theaters.

I mean with that many men at risk I just think one extra guy might increase the odds. I know the beginning of the movie said  less is more but still I find it odd that even only 2 men on this mission. But okay I will agree with 2 sort of but not sent him alone.

ffql1nd,"Aaaaaand of course Indian theaters have to ruin this just like any other movie by putting a 15-minute interval smack dab in middle so they can sell more overpriced snacks and show more  ads. Because releasing it weeks late wasn't bad enough already. Fucking hell.

Funnily enough, the one time they DID actually show a movie without an interval was Avatar because they had just started with the 3D stuff and they were afraid people would run out of the theater with the cheap-ass flimsy, smudged, not really working 3D glasses during the interval. Yeah, because we all have giant fucking 3D TVs at home. 

Fucking everything is just motivated by money. I don't think anybody here fucking cares about the moviegoing experience. That's why movies here are fucking glorified musicals with some 1940's-ass slapstick comedy in between.

Not to mention the movie always starting 20 minutes late anyway and everything from the national anthem to 14 anti smoking PSAs playing before it.

Oh, also the giant 'SMOKING KILLS' text that flies onto screen whenever anyone pulls out or even TALKS about having a smoke. And every fucking swear word right up to 'crap' and 'hell' and 'bitch' being bleeped out. Fucking hell. Sure, show us countless dead bodies and horrific violence, but a couple f-bombs? Oh no, THAT'S where you draw the line.

And kinda off-topic, but they always cut any sex scenes or even ones tangentially related to sex, even if BARELY SUGGESTIVE. Dude you really think people here don't know how to fuck? HOW DO WE HAVE 1.38 ***BILLION*** PEOPLE THEN?! THERE'S NO ROOM TO EVEN FUCKING BREATHE. 

Well it's not like anyone here respects the experience anyway. That's why there's a minimum of 3 screaming babies, 12 people talking loudly on their phone, 5 just playing PUBG at full brightness and volume, and 4 constantly explaining the plot of the movie to their distracted friends.

The worst of the worst are those fucking worthless fucks who loudly scream and cheer whenever they see anyone they recognize. ""HEyYYyyYyy tHat'S dR. stRraNge omG dO a PoRtaLLL!!!!!"", ""WhOoOoooo guYz iTs mOriArTyyy fuCk yeA!!!1111""

I'd even pretty much sworn off theaters. But I just had to go for this movie. Now I'm really fucking done. Never again. Never fucking again.

I'm sure there's some little issues with it that I can understand but I loved it.

I expected George Mackay to be left on his own after Lance Blake dies due to the marketing but it was still a sad scene and I didn't predict how he would die.

I saw it in iMax and it looked and sounded great. I loved the scene after Schofield wakes up. Looked amazing.
The scene with him running to get past the first wave was brilliant too.

When Blake's older brother was shown to be played by Richard Madden I thought ""they don't really look alike..."" but I could see it when Richard Madden started to nearly cry. Wouldn't surprise me if he tried to mimic the way Dean Charles Chapman acted when dying or vice versa.",emi5z3

fdxkpv0,"Just amazing. This and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, although this much more so, completely engulfed you in a different time period to where it’s jarring to leave the theater after.

The part where I teared up was the shot looking back over the little house and hilly area when he gets in the back of the truck. The effectiveness of the one shot feel was already impactful but that’s where it really crushed me because he’s looking back at the trees and stone wall where they had just minutes ago walked and how quickly and brutally things change in war. By those trees, Blake says something like “I’d want my ribbon, men die for that you know” and not even minutes later meets that fate. The scene where BLake is asking him to write to his mom and say he wasn’t scared as he’s panicking about dying... just incredible 

Also, the shots in the trenches where explosions  would hit and they’d rush past people who definitely just died just showed the sheer randomness and anonymity of war. The contrast of the beauty and technical mastery of the shots on a subject as ugly as the battlefield and death had me in awe and horror simultaneously.

Even the extras are all on the top of their game, my eyes were always scanning background soldiers to see if they were legit or pulling a Dark Knight Rises but they were more than legit. Which helped make the film feel so real. 

There’s so much else I wanna say but my thoughts are so discombobulated. I love how long Blake’s death scene is, and every famous British actor that does a bit in this fucking crushes it.

When Schofield is rendered unconscious, we could charitably grant that up to 8 hours elapse before he comes to. We're left with roughly 8 hours of ""real time"" unfolding in an 'unbroken' two hour window.

Don't they have observation balloons and reconnaissance airplanes that could easily tell if there were Germans on the other side of no man's land? Seems like if they have aerial photos of the trap being set they'd also have them of their own battlefield.

But maybe getting that recon only happens every few weeks, so you might go quite awhile without accurate intel? Any armchair historians out there?

And speaking of planes, why not send them in planes to deliver the message? Seems like they were close enough to some with the dogfight going on. Heck carrier pigeon it over!",emi5z3

ffqo7vw,"I noticed that they never lingered on any of the photographs of anybody's families — just an oblique look to show what they were with the actual faces and details being obscured by sharp light, whether it was the German family photo in the mine shaft or Blake and Scofield's family photos. I took it as showing that nobody other than the soldiers could understand and truly see what their families really meant to them.

It could also show how the soldiers saw their families as being in the faraway light while they were here in the very depths of darkness itself. Or that the light meant that they would in fact eventually reunite, in a place of pure light — heaven (yeah probably a reach).

Later I also felt that it could symbolize how the time we live in much more full of light and thus that light (happiness/times of peace/easy lives/no fear of loved ones being killed in war/etc.) is what prevents us from really seeing the full weight of the sacrifice the soldiers made — leaving their families to fight a war.

fi6gs9e,"Man, that was a good movie. Probably better than Dunkirk for me with which it shares some aspects.

From a technical standpoint, it was top notch. The atmosphere was haunting, obviously the cinematography was mindblowing and the crossing th eNo Man's Land scene is probably one of the most horrifying movie moments I have ever seen.

With that said, I have a few **minor** criticisms. For one, I thought the soundtrack was very distracting and poorly fitting in some places. Like the flare scene in the town, I felt a big dissonance between what I was hearing and what I was seeing. Overall I think more subtlety would have helped. 

As has been pointed out, the Germans felt very one dimensional and they seemed to have taken the Stormtrooper-ness too literally. 

The one shot thing honestly didn't really do much. The hidden cuts became incredibly distracting and I think the movie could have used more ultra wides, panoramic shots and stuff like that.

And this isn't a problem with the movie but my cinema had shitty speakers so that sucked too I guess.

Maybe there are a few other nitpicks like how the paper managed to somehow survive all that soaking and blood and mud but honestly who cares, this movie is a true experienced I really enjoyed it and it's like a 8,5/10 for me.",emi5z3

Of course the technical aspect of it is brilliant, with immense ammount of craft behind and a couple of truly amazing scenes (like the burning village sequence). But I didn't felt any emotional connection to the main characters, the whole film felt too perfect, too slick, too video game-like. In contrast the hectic, fragmented style of Dunkirk made the war much more visceral, chaotic and life-threatening, and the end of that film felt like the biggest, most emotionally releasing catharsis I could feel watching a movie. By the end of 1917, I was actually getting bored. This movie just feels like a huge, very well made show-off by Mendes.",emi5z3

F*ck the critics lambasting it for being too 'sanitized'  (I guess they would only have been satisfied if the main guy raped that woman) I thought it was plenty grim. In no way does it glorify war - the main character was like 10 shades of PTSD.

With these movies with a supposed 'gimmick' - (like Irishman's aging CGI) I really try not to get distracted by that and I suggest others do the same about the extended take business. I thought it worked well in the film without being intrusive.

I'm just surprised with all the oscar nominations the movie got George MacKay  was not nominated for best actor - his performance literally carries the film.

fdpctvf,"I really wanted to like it but it just didn't do it for me.

The technical aspects were great. The one-shot feel, the cinematography, and the production design were all top notch but it just felt like the story and characters were secondary to the ""idea"" of what could be done technically. It just made the story and characters feel a little forced and they just ended up being the means to an end.

I also have to blame the marketing for lessening the effect of the film. Almost every ""money shot"" was shown in the trailers. We were shown the explosion in the bunker, the plane crashing, the shootout on the bridge, the exchange of gunfire in the house, the journey through the ruins (again, only shown for the technical aspects), the jump from the bridge, and the sprint through the battlefield. We essentially knew from the start that at least one of the two main characters completes the journey which kills the ride. There was never anything to worry about, especially since the enemies could never hit a shot and our heroes could run away unharmed. 

At the end of the film, it almost just felt like a demo reel without any real substance. It was like sitting through a boring rollercoaster where, although the engineer did a hell of a job, they forgot that the ride needs to be enjoyable.",emi5z3

That seems like it would kill you, but even if he survived wouldn't at least one of those rocks broken a bone or something? Then he got the back of his head cracked open by falling down some stairs and was still running around no problem. 

On a slightly related note, I feel like Tom died a bit too fast. I get that getting stabbed in the stomach can be lethal, but could it really kill you in a couple of minutes? I'd imagine he'd be able to survive for at least a few hours before losing too much blood.",emi5z3

fdzvtru,"My girlfriend left the theater crying as the credits rolled. I was also emotionally moved, almost to tears.

Great picture, saw it in IMAX and just felt immersed in the movie. Kinda still felt like I was in it after I left, like I was the camera or something. 

Very simple story, point A to point B and dealing with the obstacles along the way.

I was really touched by that little moment of humanity where he came upon the girl and the baby. 

Also when the cherry blossom leaves landed on him to wake him up in the river and then he had to crawl over bloated dead bodies to get to shore. 

Very powerful use of juxtaposition.

Also when he cut his hand on barbed wire and then stuck it in a corpse, I was certain he’d get sepsis or something from it.",emi5z3

The only thing that I'm not really sure about is the scene where the downed German pilot stabs Blake nearly immediately after being rescued. I have heard many a time that the chivalry of WWI aviators was at least overstated, if not an outright myth, but it definitely seems uncharacteristic for an outnumbered and wounded POW to attack someone who just helped save his life.",emi5z3

that scene keeps making me think about what i would do in that situation where there is a seemingly defenseless enemy. it's cold-blooded, but i dont think there would be an option to let the him live. it's too risky. even if he begs and pleads, you can't know whether he's lying or not. you dont know if he has a hidden weapon or not. and then you would pay for it. even if you tied him up, your folks would come along and kill him. any thoughts on what you could possibly otherwise do in that situation ?",emi5z3

fdqszxj,"Saw it a week ago and enjoyed it immensely. Story/genre-wise, it is nothing new with movies like Saving Private Ryan and Dunkirk already being precedent to 1917. It distinguishes itself with the single-shot edit, and that makes it memorable. Both lead actors worked well together and actually made me feel bad for the events in the middle of the film.  

Two major memorable scenes that I really liked were the our look into No-Man's Land, which showed the desolation and destruction in between two armies, and the night scene in the ruined village in which the flares and fires light up the destroyed buildings. These two scenes were helped immensely by Thomas Newman's score, which is kinda electronic but it works.  

Historically, the movie isn't really based on a particular battle, but I liked how they showed a bit of what trench life was like, and the brown and dirty destruction of the front only to walk a few feet/meters and be in untouched nature. Of course, with this movie being from a British POV, the Germans will be the antagonists naturally, but I would have liked to have seen scenes of Germans as POWs or something to show that they were fighting this war for the same reason as the British, that is for Old World politics, and maybe seen some friendly interaction. The Germans in the film I kept being reminded of Nazi's but in WWI. Those are just nitpicks but I'm happy to be able to see more WWI in modern cinema.",emi5z3

fe64jhd,"Man, 30 minutes out of this film and I still have a sensation all over my body that can only be described as immense. This film immerses you into a situation you were not quite expecting, even if you were expecting it. For a vast majority of us who live this modern lifestyle, we will never understand the gravity of being in that situation, where there is an intense personal responsibility as well as an intense larger responsibility. The way that you as the viewer are placed into this situation in a very realistic and unfiltered way is very encompassing emotionally and at times physically as well. Many on here said they were in tears from the sheer gravity of the situation in which we the viewer are placed, I felt the importance and unusualness of the events and watching someone going through those events is nervewracking. By the time you get deeper into the film you emotionally understand what they are going through, you are fully invested. Some movies you are loosely interested in the outcome, with this movie you are very personally and emotionally invested. At least I was. Even when the deed was done, the feeling of an uneven letdown was there too, in war you don't actually become the hero in the moment most of the time, it comes later. At the moment, it's back to business as usual, ""then fuckoff Lieutenant"".  


In terms of how the movie was shot, it seemed as if there were only 4-5 times that the camera was not on the actors, in reality, it was probably more but the raw feeling and investment you get out of that style of filming just added to the investment. In some movies there is a pause, other things happen, and then you are back on the main storyline. With 1917, there is one plot, one focus and only one thing to concentrate on and there is no time for consideration. 

I would consider this to be a great film, a 10 for what it is. If you can't handle that much emotion or focus in a film it is not going to be for you. If you want to nitpick I didn't see much to nitpick about other than the orders weren't wet when he gave them to the Colonel. The single-shot style of filmmaking told the story,  when they went in the large crater on the frontline and walked around the pond in the middle of the crater and the camera panned with them from the middle of the pond it was great, if you don't have that style you end up with a normal film, that is not what 1917 is. IMO 1917 wanted to put you in shoes that you weren't wearing, and my feet are still wet.",emi5z3
fe69wq3,"Thomas Newman has always been my favorite composer. His work on this film only shows that throughout the years he has never lost his sense of scale, or his sense of emotion with putting a piece together to compliment a scene properly. The flare scene in the ruins is probably one of the more beautiful sequences that I've seen from Deakins. Everything about it felt so dreamlike and so abstract in nature that you couldn't help but be engulfed in the moment. Best sequence for me is them going through No Man's Land. The entire scene just displayed a crazy level of chaos and brutality, and the one take method they went with only amplifies that intensity, and that's where it really clicks as to why he went with this particular style.",emi5z3
fe6bdzh,"I thought the movie was very good.

I really liked Andrew Scott's bit at the beginning, and was pleased when the credits rolled to find I had correctly identified the actor as Hot Priest.

During the part where the soldier was singing in the woods, I was SO impatient and it was driving me crazy every time he started another verse. Just because a) time was wasting for him to deliver the message! And b) I was really curious how he was going to announce himself to these guys.

I do really wish we got some closure on that mother though, that was such a beautiful scene. Also really, really love that they showed other commonwealth troops like the Ghurkas, which is historically accurate, but I'm sure some dumbass will claim the movie is trying to be ""politically correct"", I can see it now.",emi5z3

ff3z6bf,"I’ve seen a handful of war movies in my life. Some good, some bad, some fantastic, some shit. I didn’t have many expectations for this film. I was hoping for some entertaining shooting and effects, hopefully some good characters too, while being prepared for the typical “us vs them” type of mentality so popular in war films. Especially against Germans in the world wars. So nothing too spectacular but entertaining enough to watch. That was my expectation...

This movie was FUCKING AMAZING. The cinematography, the acting, the set pieces. I loved it all. The film had this feel, this vibe, about it that I truly loved. It felt authentic. It’s still not my personal favorite WWI film, All quiet on the western front still holds #1 for me. But damn is it definitely in my top 3. I really enjoyed this film. Highly recommended, 10/10.",emi5z3
ffd3cwq,"That was intense. Actual chills after that. 

I have a jump scare pet peeve, so that initial ‘going over the top’ had me initially annoyed because ‘yeah there’ll be a sniper somewhere’. Or something sudden would happen with a tasing of the orchestra.... but no. That restraint before the first jump was super intense and psychological, I was on edge. Perfect. Even the rats and skulls they ran into could have been played for jumps, but they restrained themselves which I liked.

Then they came and I was less thrilled, the trip wire was the initial brunt but I was already invested by then. 

I liked the recurrence of the letter from the pocket into the container for the rapids, and the milk in the canteen for the baby, and how it all fit together as the ‘long take’.

The “wokeness” of having BAME extras wasn’t distracting, in spite of what certain individuals were upset about. Yeah it’s made me check if they were scattered throughout the battalions like that, and yes they were (sort of) so that’s that.

Things that were cliché in modern war movies, like the sniper and the presence of a hiding civilian with the child that the friendly bumps into with Germans close nearby was there, but it helped with pacing so I can’t be down on it.

The Germans’ behaviour throughout the movie made no sense to me. All it took was one to stop chasing and start shooting properly and it was game over.

Which brings me to the crux of the movie that I mostly like: It feels like an FPS. All one mission. The multiple characters you run into intercut with being on your own, the ticking clock that speeds up or slows down depending on what’s happening, being knocked unconscious to make time move forward, the different levels intercut with parts exposition and intensity/cinematic set pieces (the grassland level, the tunnel/‘sewer level, the water level, the bombed out town level etc), ‘NPCs’ you glance at once before progressing, how ‘close’ everything was... I could go on.

All in all, a good movie I’d recommend as a spectacle, but not the best war movie for mine. Very impressively made though, I’d see another like it in a heartbeat.",emi5z3

fiutysw,"This might be unpopular opinion, but this movie would so much better without most of the music.

Whyyy add forced ""tension"" music to already-tense scene? Why add ""heroic"" music to clearly visible heroic actions? I feel like those single-shot scenes would feel that more real without it and unfortunately it spoiled the suspense for me, almost every time. And felt cheap.

The constant background (and foreground) music just doesn't go well with a war film IMO and especially one which otherwise does everything to feel brutal and realistic.",emi5z3

No kidding, it’s the kind of film that puts you into the skin of the hunter, all his senses at 120%, as you can’t afford to miss one detail. The tension won’t leave you 1 sec.

fdpopei,"I will start by saying that I did NOT want to see this movie, but went at the behest of my husband. And boy am I glad I did! 

I knew Deakins did BR2049 which was gorgeous and he absolutely nailed it again in this one. Also the way it felt like all one shot really immersed me in the experience. I know some people think the plot was weak but I thought it was enough—a man wants to save his brother and his tried and true friend goes with him. I even got some Frodo/Samwise vibes from their relationship in a weird way but I’m here for it. 

This was definitely an excellent movie, even though I’m usually not a fan of war movies. My husband still needs to take me to Frozen 2 :D",emi5z3

Going from Schofield doing all he can to carry dying Blake or treat him all alone, to there’s 150 guys a few yards away on the other side of this house and no one saw or heard each other until after Blake died, felt really badly timed.

fe57sow,"I definitely liked it overall but honestly it was hit or miss for me. The scene in the war torn town with the flares going was pretty amazing. When he was distracted by the fire and didn’t see the soldier that was a perfect escalation of tension.

But honestly I thought that it struggled with appropriate exposition and was a little too stylized in some moments. A found myself thinking a couple times “I am deeeeefinitely watching a blockbuster movie right now”. It’s pretty similar to my main (and basically only) criticism of Saving Private Ryan.

Not only the set design but what I think is the CGi fire looking realistic, the pyrotechnics were amazing. The acting was phenomenal. The way you could see the blood leave his face as he was dying without a cut makes me wonder how they did that.

Definitely the best war film since Saving Private Ryan.

fdysi6h,"Holy mother of God this movie.

It's not a movie where I can say ""hey, remember that scene?"". No, this movie needs to be seen for how it looks.

There are many cases where people say for Marvel movies ""This was spectacle"", and I agree, they are made to look like a spectacle and they do damn good job at it.

But 1917 blows any Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to spectacle and being a wonder. So many times during watching this movie I noticed I'm not looking at main characters but rather at scenery around them.

Decided to watch it in IMAX and that was probably best decision I could've made. Every scene looked wide as fuck and that's something that just blew me away.

I know I'm fanboying hard over this movie, but well, sorry, I can't remember last time I was this pulled into the actual movie.

You know the commercial that plays in Cineworld before IMAX movies? ""Watch a movie... or be part of one"". This time I felt like part of one.

fecho9d,"The flare-lit night time city scene, due to it happening after the character suffered some head injury, accompanied by dreamlike cinematography, and a musical backdrop that employs an augmented triad that is almost a cliche in science fiction filmmaking, made me think that the film was walking into the ""unreliable narrator"" territory.

fdw6fx9,"I thought the movie itself WRT the characters were weak. They felt one dimensional in needing to get the message across. I wished for more conversations or a chance to get to know them, but that wasn’t the movie’s goal. The direction and immersion with the help of Roger Deakin is what the movie set out to do and I couldn’t take my eyes off it for a second. 

I was amazed but when Will woke up during the scene with the flares in the air casting overarching shadows and brightness was a visual feast and sold me entirely on best picture. That scene was a religious experience in Dolby Cinema. This might not be your typical action movie, it might not be your typical war movie, but movies like this is why you go to the theater. The ability to melt away the projector screen to immerse you in a different world, that’s the magic of filmmaking. What a good way to start 2020.",emi5z3

It was really good at building suspense, I just wish they hadn’t used the final shot of everyone charging out of the trench in the marketing because knowing that was coming kind of ruined the mood. The scene with the German pilot really got me thinking about the war in general. Even though the two enemy soldiers pulled him from the crash and tried to save him, he still attacked them anyway. Brutal and unforgiving, one of the things that made this movie good. The scene at the end where he tells the other guy that his brother died was absolutely heartbreaking.

As much as I enjoyed it I really don’t think the movie was anything special. Short of the one-shot gimmick it was kind of forgettable. It’ll probably end up winning a lot of awards, and rightfully so because there really haven’t been any better movies this year (last year? Idk).",emi5z3
fe2cz1a,I think this should win best picture. It will win almost every technical award. That song towards the end the one soldier was singing was great. One of my favorite scenes in a long time,emi5z3
fe5suh2,"Two years ago, I nearly drowned while whitewater rafting, so when Schofield is being swept away, I was extremely anxious, even more so than already.  I was so relieved when he finally made it to shore, even after climbing over the floating bodies.

Then he realizes that he's there. He hears singing.  And oh my God, the soldier is singing one of my favorite hymns, ""Poor Wayfaring Stranger."" I sing this song to my children as a lullaby.  I absolutely lost it.  It just completely overwhelmed me.  

Fantastic film.  I don't think I'll ever watch it again.",emi5z3

feyc17u,"Beautiful movie, 9/10, can't wait till it's available digitally so I can rewatch certain scenes over and over

The one thing I didn't completely understand was when Schofield said he hated being home. I guess he meant visiting home on leave, but the emotional beat made it so important I first got the feeling he meant he hated being home *at all* for some mysterious reason",emi5z3

Although it felt like a single player campaign mode sometimes. Great film",emi5z3

The next soldier he runs into immediately gets back up to charge. It’s incredible how scared these 15 and 16 year olds must have been. Mendes and Deakin’s did a phenomenal job with this one. 9.4/10 all day.",emi5z3

Yes. Just yes.",emi5z3
fdpm552,seeing schofield look at his family's pictures at the end made me think back to the french girl asking if he had children (which he didn't answer) and how well he was with the baby. breaks my heart that young father like him was in a war like that.,emi5z3

fdpoqin,"This was fantastic. The acting was great, the story was simple but effective with the ticking clock, the effects and locations were wonderful. There isn’t much bad I can say about this. It is slow and slightly oddly paced at parts. And the only negative that stuck out were that the cuts weren’t super well hidden and were sometimes jarring. I also loved how it was set up that Cumberbatch was this attack crazy ass but they gave actual reason for him wanting to get this shit over with and how there wasn’t some big moral argument between him and the messenger. I’d give this an 8.5/10",emi5z3

fdpqkt8,"I only have good things to say about this film. No complaints whatsoever. I know it’s inevitably going to be compared so I’m just gonna say I enjoyed this more then Dunkirk. Loved McKay and everyone else’s acting performances, loved how it was a one shot and made you feel tense and engaged the whole time, loved the set designs and cinematography and etc.,, and I just really enjoyed the story and how it gives you a first hand experience of what it was like to be in those two guys’ situation.

fdpvacu,"Just got home from seeing this masterpiece. Wow, I expectwd it to be good but it absolutely blew me away.

fdqngjb,"Andrew Scott oozes charisma, even in a WWI trench.",emi5z3
fdqrc4u,"My favourite films of the last 12 months have been Dragged Across Concrete, Marriage Story, The Nightingale, and now 1917. This Sam Mendes film won best film at The Golden Globes and deservingly so.

I would be happy if Marriage Story won at the Oscars, but not since 12 Years A Slave has an ‘Epic’ film won it. And looking at the list there have not been many in the last 30 years. (ROTK, Gladiator, Titanic, Braveheart, Schindlers List and Dances With Wolves). Other films have been worthy winners but do not have that ‘Epic’ feel. 1917 has it!

Many people will make comparisons with Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan. 1917 is a slower paced film than both, set in more or less real time. There are action scenes, thankfully little to no CG. But there is more down time than guns, bombs and fights. This might not be for everyone.

I found the film to be very gripping and suspenseful, but a film about determination, survival and humanity more than a war film.

Thank you Roger Deakins for your excellent work again. And coincidently enough this is probably the best film I have watched at the cinema since Blade Runner 2049.",emi5z3

Man, what a beautifully shot film. A lot of scenes had me wondering how the fuck did they film this? Scho and Blake going around the water in the giant crater for example. Just a great film overall. I love that the milk came in handy later in the film. And also, trees definitely signified hope and/or safety? Instantly brought Road to Perdition to mind while I was watching, how water signified death. I want so much to watch it again but I think I’ll wait for home release.

Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins did a phenomenal job. Also, George MacKay was excellent, holy shit. I did not expect him to be this great. If this year wasn’t so stacked with fantastic performances already, he would be getting more awards. I hope to see him in future films.",emi5z3
fdtg2rl,"Watching this and *Th*e *Rise of Skywalker* in the same week was interesting for me. They are both very different movies in a sense, but I would also categorize both as adventure movies and primed me to think about the challenges of having a variety of locations and set-pieces in a movie and how they transition between them. *1917*'s obvious hurdle to overcome is packing in a movie's worth of ideas while staying committed to a faux single-take gimmick and WWI realism. Time and space are less of a challenge for a more conventional movie like *Skywalker* which is free to use the power of editing and sci-fi technology to get through its laundry list of things to do and places to see. But *1917* is operating under the guise that we are seeing these events in real-time. Obviously the filmmakers were going to have to cheat a little. But did they cheat effectively? Did they cheat too much?

My favorite moment of the movie is when Schofield is riding off in the back of a truck with a company of British soldiers and the camera pans to overlook the entire farm where the last 15 or so minutes of the movie happened, including the grove of cherry blossom trees and the trail Schofield and Blake walked as they approached the farm. It's an emotionally powerful moment given all that transpired at this location and really gives a nice intimate sense of coherent space. I felt like the single-take approach really paid off then.

Other parts of the movie were disappointingly not as consistent. The one that stood out the most to me was the introduction of the Écoust location. When Schofield is dropped off at the destroyed bridge, there's clearly just one building on the other side. But when night falls and he looks out of the upper-story window, there's now an entire smoldering town set right outside. It felt very jarring. There are other similar moments where transitions between locations happen almost magically and the sense of distance between each location makes it feel like everything in the movie should be happening in earshot.

Overall I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but I'm pretty bored with these elaborate long takes. It was neat when Cuarón did it in *Children of Men*, but so many big movies and TV shows have at least one shot like that the past few years and there is kind of a homogenizing effect. They are technically impressive, but also fairly conventional in terms of how they show things. They don't really feel any different to me than how any average scene works in a typical Hollywood movie. Seeing movies like this that rely so much on them tends to remind me of the drawbacks and limitations of that approach more so than the advantages. Editing is a very important and powerful tool in movies. The ability to maneuver around time and perspective is an important tool for storytelling in general. I don't need to literally be with a character at every instant and see everything they see to empathize with them.",emi5z3
fdtjn9y,Anyone know how they made it feel like it was one continuous shot the whole time??? It was amazing and really kept you in the story and on your toes following the protagonists on their mission. Liked it a lot more than I thought I would going in.,emi5z3
fdtouaa,"Liked this movie. Loved the long shots with no cuts. My favorite part of the movie was when he was riding in the back of the bus with the other soldiers. Something about those scenes just stood out to me. I think it was the change up from the constant forward momentum that made it so effective. And instead of cutting to different angles of people’s faces in the bus, the camera is fixed at one location. It’s what you would see if you were in the bus with them. 

One thing I wish was better(very small nitpick if I have to nitpick anything) was that I feel like I would have enjoyed even more tension if possible. I didn’t quite feel it as much as I was expecting to. To contrast this with a tense movie I saw recently,  when I watched Uncut Gems I felt completely exhausted afterwards. It was so intense and I wanted a bit more of that from this movie too. 

But other than that I think it was pretty perfect. The emotional beats really hit for me and I welled up for a sec at one point at the end. It was also a really beautiful movie. The long shots focusing the actors faces, the way they captured nature and general atmosphere kinda remind me of The Revenant. 


Overall a great experience.",emi5z3
fdtw6og,Even though it isn’t. I’m pretty sure this is one of my top favorites for “continuous shot” films of all time.,emi5z3
fdut042,Beautiful film. I was hooked to my seat throughout and really enjoyed the phenomenal cinematography. My favorite scene was the one with the Wayfairing Stranger song. Hats off to everyone involved!,emi5z3
fdvwdsc,"I loved this film so much. First, I really appreciate that Firth, Cumberbatch, and Hot Priest had good solid roles but were only onscreen for one scene each. Second, Tom’s death hit me out of nowhere - the entire scene I kept expecting him to just get up and make it, so when he actually died it came as a real surprise.

Obviously the editing was fantastic, the pacing was great, and the performances were top notch. Hope either this or Parasite wins Best Picture, I cant think of any other movies that came close to their quality.",emi5z3
fdw3dyh,"Just watched in VMax (would be doing a disservice to yourself to not see it in the best possible picture and audio cinema around) , cinematography is insanely good, acting is also on par, except something about this film just won't stick with me like JoJo Rabbit and Little Women did.

fe0j8ke,"It's a story that's a little contrived and there's one particular ""wet"" sequence that I didn't really care for but, my god, this is one hell of a movie. I actually felt a human emotion when a character died. I think it's worthy of best picture. The cinematography is absolutely insane. 

I was hyped for 1917, the Irishman, and OUATIH, and this is the only one of those three that exceeded my expectations.",emi5z3
fe0jj7d,"After Blake and Schofield discuss medals made of tin and scraps of ribbon, Schofield got emotional and said he couldn’t go home. Blake pauses and catches back up with Schofield before they investigate the abandoned farm. 

Question: At the end of the movie, Schofield sits next to the tree, pulls out the pictures of his wife and child. Is his family dead and that’s why he can’t go back home? With them being dead, he felt as though he had nothing else to return to?",emi5z3
fe0nskb,"*1917* is stunning. It's been said to death but the work that went into the visuals and the attention to detail is something to behold.   
  
Also I thought the pacing was great. It keeps pushing and pushing along through hardships with these brief moments of safety that come at a price, or prelude another danger around the corner.  
  
It all amounts to a very convincing journey through something grand in scope, but despite it's extreme attention to visual detail, I do think something is lost within it.  
  
The movie made a very bold move axing one of the main characters halfways through, and while I have to applaud it for an unexpected and even ballsy choice, I do think it was to the movie's detriment as it tosses the dynamic between the two friends and makes it much less compelling.    
  
For me this was a problem because we aren't given much about our new main. We get a little at a time and often there isn't time because he's too busy racing against the clock. This wasn't as much of an issue early in because he had Blake to react off and develop. The big names in this movie who could also serve that purpose come and go in a flash. At the end of the day, we are still following this character. The war is a backdrop. So it's unfortunate that the backdrop is so much more fleshed out, even if it looks incredible.  
  
  
Further the soundtrack feels ill fitting which I hate to say because I absolutely love Thomas Newman's work. I just found it at odds with a movie that demanded something that really ratcheted up the tension more.  
  
Overall I still really enjoyed it, but if I'm being honest the only thing that will stick with me will be the set pieces.",emi5z3
fe3a76v,"Kilgore felt like a nod to Kurt Vonnegut, possibly because of Slaughterhouse Five and its discussion of war movies.

I like this way more than the movies that people were saying are their favourites from last year, and I don't understand any of the criticism about not having character development. There was plenty of that, albeit very subtle, but I felt the characters were very compelling and it's my favourite movie that released last year out of the ones I've seen so far, by a mile.

On a side note, I don't think it will win all the Oscars it was nominated for, but I sure hope it wins at least a couple",emi5z3

feg8esv,"Glad to finally see the film in Dolby Cinema the preferred format the cinematographer [Roger Deakins](https://www.rogerdeakins.com/film-talk/1917-release-dates/) suggested. I tried to watch it last Thursday on its wide release and AMC Dolby screen was having issues and both showings that night got cancelled. Movie was very visually pleasing and horrifying with the horrible conditions of the poor souls who had to have lived and fought through no man's land, the waiting game, the sending waves of men to die. The acting was fantastic. When the older brother realized Blake was dead was heartbreaking. The charge scene was stressful. The bullets and explosions while sounding great they can almost convey the hell those men had to hear or the last things they heard before they died. I might watch it a couple more times at most. A very stressful but good film.",emi5z3
fes5vkh,"I just got back from a screening. Wow. Two long cuts with a single fade to black in the middle - I have no idea how the cinematographer did it...

Thomas Newman's score also really reminded me of the work of Ralph Vaughan Williams, the British composer (the last scene in particular was definitely channeling 'The Lark Ascending'). That's fitting when you think about it, as Vaughan Williams served as a lieutenant in France during the war.",emi5z3
feuur31,"My only minor “gripes” were the relatively quick restoration of health early on in the movie, and the travel confusion. How were they not blown up by the tripwire? How was Blake not severely concussed after being blown against a stone wall, and what about Scofield’s relatively quick recovery after nearly being buried to death and inhaling pulverized stone? And when Scofield was riding in the truck, it was a little confusing when he was dropped off. It *was* the village he was looking for, but why didn’t anyone say so? It seemed like he had stumbled on some random chapel, when he hadn’t.

BUT, these had little to no effect on my personal enjoyment of the film. The opening take of the walk into the trench? Mesmerizing. The nighttime flare scene? Beautiful. An enchanting film, filled with both tense and heartfelt moments.",emi5z3
fev09yw,"This was a really good movie, probably #1 of 2019 for me  because of what was done on a technical level .Even though the story was very simple I was still invested,  entertained and mesmerized by what was happening onscreen.  

The movie is just as much as action/adventure film as it is an war movie to me maybe even more so. An action/adventure with high stakes set during a horrific time.",emi5z3
fevxybh,"The beginning in the British trench harkens back to medieval days. The Brodie helmet lends itself well, and director def made some good costume choices to push that feel.",emi5z3
ffk8zhj,"I'd say from a film point of view it was well done. It was brilliant the way it feels like it was done in one shot. I do think it really showed the horrors of the endless trenches. I also appreciate the conciseness of the movie. It was short and too the point. 

The story told in the end was one of utter chaos and confusion. From no one really knowing that the Germans left to the main character running around the town shooting and strangling Germans just sitting around by themselves. 

That said, the story was a bit contrived. I would think the general would send the message through a few channels (maybe he did behind the scenes). I would have been interested in the main's reaction upon finding out that the orders did arrive through another channel and his friend died for nothing. 

In the end, the plot really did not have a pay off. Will finds the brother but I was looking for more of a catharsis regarding Will's role in the war. He kind of stands there gets a one liner from Colonel Cumber and is dismissed. Sure, he loves his family (I don't think that was in doubt). Sure, it's fatalistic. I don't know, maybe the character has a breakdown or has to argue with the Colonel to get him to stop the advance (especially with the previous 'some men like the fight' or w/e it was). 

So overall, I'd say it was a good movie that's nicely paced. The director could probably tell a story without any dialogue that's how well it was filmed. However, I did feel like there was a bit missing. That may just be a personal opinion. I'd encourage everyone to watch it!",emi5z3

I thought he'd be fully blinded for sure and barely able to move, and that he'd keep telling Blake to abandon him through the journey and Blake wouldn't listen and finally at one point he'd shoot himself, forcing Blake to go on alone. It'd be a callback to the general at the start saying he who travels fastest travels alone. And then at the end his family would receive a medal for him, because he seemed enamored by the idea of a medal and brought it up a few times.",emi5z3

The fronts were miles and miles long.  If the character (I never remember their names) needed to get somewhere else down the line, why didn't he just go up the line to the unit he needed to find? Why would he need to cross no man's land if they hadn't attacked yet?

fecwa1t,"People are going to rave about the cinematography and editing in this movie, and rightly so, it's beautiful and the long take format is technically brilliant. But narratively I think it suffers from the format. There's the big time jump when he gets knocked out sure, but at several other points in the film things happen in very convenient succession that keeps the pacing of the film engaging but makes the one-shot format less immersive. Like when the other battalion shows up right after Thomas dies, or how the bridge is out like 300 feet down the road from where they get stuck in mud, or how Will sat for like two minutes to listen to that guy singing, and that two minutes cost hundreds of lives as the first wave went over, if you take the timeline of events as literally what we saw. It's clear that they're compressing time between events to keep the movie from being boring, but these are places where a cut would have been helpful. Like when he hides from the German soldier in the ruined village, and finds a young woman with a baby in the basement. The German soldier would of course have immediately reported what he saw and send a scouting party to find Will, and they would have found the woman and baby. Time was clearly warped in that scene but also space as well. Had they been less committed to the long cut gimmick they could have added a cut here to make things make more sense. It was cool don't get me wrong, but a few cuts could have helped the story structure.",emi5z3

I thought that first act of this film was outstanding, then after a surprising death, the film’s pace comes to a screeching halt. 

After that, there just isn’t enough plot to carry the film to the finish line. It all just becomes rather monotonous. Many scenes in hindsight appear to be no more than filler to pad the runtime.

This movie will be remembered for years! An instant classic that will definitely stand the test of time.,emi5z3
fe6d7xi,"This movie was amazing. I wish I hadn’t read too much about how they filmed it, because I kept getting distracted trying to see when they would cut or looking in the background and set pieces. 

People saying there was no character development, but I mean how much can you do when the whole movie takes place within a couple hours. But I did felt really bad when the younger Blake brother was killed. Totally didn’t expect him to die. 

Some notable stuff is when that one officer told Schofield before he left the convoy, to make sure there are witnesses because some on top of the ranks only care about winning battles. As well as when Colonel Mackenzie says that by next Thursday they will order them to do the same thing again either way.

Crazy to think most of those fighting where late teens and early 20’s. No way people nowadays would ever get thru something like trench warfare.",emi5z3
fkoooj4,"Absolutely an amazing achievement and a creative idea for a one take but i felt like the restraints of the plot and the movie media went against the one shot. Sets were changing too frequently, felt like an open world video game were scale of environments is drastically smaller than in real life to keep the game engaging.
I felt like there were too many war movies tropes in this one. Especially the girl and the baby were at bit too jarring, like movie forced a quite personal moment.

I understand that watching two people walk for two hours would be boring but then maybe reconsider the plot to find a story that could be better represented in a realistic one shot movie. If they did 4-5 cuts between major sets then it would seem more realistic. Like they did one cut, why not then do a few. Movie is already technically not a single shot, story wise

It may seem like i hate the movie but to be fair it was really good. I just feel like there are fundamental incompatibilities between the story and the single shot approach",emi5z3
fdsa67h,"Overall boring film. The cinematography, score, costumes as well as the set design was absolutely amazing. But the characters and story was a huge let down, i almost didn't care about the two main characters and their mission.

I'm a huge fan of war films, but this one was a let down imho.",emi5z3
fdpknvq,"This was fine. The worst part of the movie was the gimmick itself. I just think that it makes the geography of many sequences confusing (mostly because the blocking is bad) and it also means that there are portions of the movie where literally nothing happens. The gimmick does work really well whenever it's in tighter space though, especially the last 5-10 minutes but I really don't know why Mendes couldn't have just used a series of long shots. I love Cuaron films because he could have made Gravity or Children of Men one long shot but he didn't because he knows it's important to have hard cuts in your movies.

Also, the movie did have one hard cut in the middle of the movie and betrays its own gimmick.

Other than that, I think the movie is technically impressive, the night sequence looked surreal (it's probably the best thing Deakins has shot in the 2010s), George McKay is really good, and the last 5-10 minutes was pretty satisfying to watch. It just could have thrown away the gimmick and it would have been better. Also could have had a more well written and meaningful story. 6/10",emi5z3

fdphte4,"I can't remember feeling *exhausted* like this after a movie. You really feel like you're taking every step of the journey with Schofield. I saw this with my mother and brother, and hugged them both outside the theater after the film. I was emotionally drained. This was a beautifully made film. Gorgeous and brutal. And so many shots you could hang on a wall. Like that line of men taking a leak on the side of the abandoned house, or Schofield staring at the burning town, or the soldier singing Wayfaring Stranger (which I adored because, from a distance, the soldier's voice is ethereal and clear, but once you get up close, you can hear the nerves in his voice. Such a wonderfully subtle thing). Give Roger Deakins more awards. He deserves them all. 

With all that having been said, I can't wait to see it again and try to detect where all the cuts were! I'm terrible at spotting those types of things and only counted around 7.",emi5z3

>!After he departs the trucks and talks to the CO there he begins to walk to the destroyed footbridge which is only about 100 feet away. He then gets shot at by the sniper from the window while crossing it. Why couldn't the people from the trucks come over and shoot at the sniper. We didn't see them drive off as he was walking away. Before he got out of cover the last time to fire off those few shots I expected the entire window to just be lit up by allied fire from across the river. Did anyone else think this?!<",emi5z3
fdrmbqg,"I honestly agree with all the praise this has been getting from everywhere.

But I had real issues with every single german trying to kill him when he showed that he didn't want to hurt them. I'm going to talk about writing logic, not movie logic.

I loved that they saved the german pilot. It was unexpected and was not really needed in the script so far (which is my main issue atm) and it ended up feeling like 'saving the cat' for saving the cats-sake. Even though the cat killed one of them after that.

What I mean is that saving a person in a movie is usually used as a way to make a character sympathetic. This is often done really well (like in 1917) or really obvious (Jyn Erso saving a random kid in Rogue One). In 1917 it also served as a dramatic crux for Schofield's journey. It's great set-up in that regard. It shows our guys as good men and that the germans are fanatical.

So Schofield does his best to not kill ANYONE after that (except for one sniper guy). But every single other german he comes across automaticly goes into murder mode. So as a viewer I somewhat expected him to be confronted to either A: kill a guy because there was no other option (I expected the guy at the church to be killed by him the moment he waved, leaving us wondering if that was actually a german or someone else). 

B: Have a german catch him, but them having a small moment (not unlike in The Pianist) and letting him pass because fuck killing people, and fuck the war. (It's just (government) men wanting to fight).

I expected the latter to happen with the german he ultimately strangles. You could say that this was his compromising moment. But it wasn't really. He just strangled an unarmed dude against his own will and pushed the other out of the way. In the end that felt really unsatisfying, writing wise. Why go through all the hassle to show us that he doesn't want to kill people, and ends up commiting a murder that could've easily been avoided by knocking the guy out instead or just running away (because the end result would've been the same). It felt like the scientist guys from Ad Astra all over again. I dunno... It just felt like someone behind the scenes going like ""he can't just murder every german he sees, he's our hero! And make ALL the germans evil!"". 

If you're making a 'pure hero' then stick to it. Because after the pilot kills his friend, and after the sniper starts shooting him while he's defenseless, he had NO reason to hold back. I would've 100% accepted that all these germans are intent on killing anyone they see, and would've been on his side anyway because he already tried to save the pilot. But he KEEPS avoiding it... for no reason or payoff.

So, while all the moments for even more tension and character building were lined up from the Katze moment. They failed to knock 'em down by leaving his morality somewhere in the middle.

But this is just me zooming in on a tiny part of this amazing movie. I honestly loved everything else. I was just wondering of someone else feels the same.",emi5z3

fefnnh7,I fucking clapped. I can’t remember the last time I wanted to do that after seeing a movie.,emi5z3
fevuqzh,"Technical masterpiece, for sure.

My one quip is that the one-shot style seemed to restrict the story a little bit since there always needed to be something happening. There were a little too many “coincidences” for me, and a couple scenes that I felt halted the pacing a bit. Still, the great visuals and impressive filmmaking make those forgivable for sure.

I’d give it a solid 8/10",emi5z3
ff8j3qt,"Thought it was decent, not my favorite war movie or film of 2019 but it was solid.  Cinematography was great, although I didn’t like the edit after he was knocked out in the tower, it took away from the one take. 

Also two parts about the trucks that picked him up concerned me.  Obviously how he didn’t hear them pull up, and also how the trucks just disappeared after he got sniped at.  Did they leave by then or did they hear the shots and not bother to help?

Didn’t make sense on who milked the cow.  The germans wouldn’t have bothered to do it.  after all, they killed the other cows and then they didn’t even take the milk

And the Germans can’t shoot at all.  Why did Will not shoot back, and why didnt he have his bayonet on either?

The one take aspect was great, although it was hard for me to understand the relative distance of everything, it didn’t feel like he traveled 6 (I think?) miles.

No concerns besides those, a little anticlimatic but I don’t feel like this needed a huge ending.  I’d give it a solid 7.5",emi5z3
fhpyyl9,I loved this movie. Nothing more to add.,emi5z3
fdqfar5," SUPER LET DOWN

I do not understand the hype this movie has. I'm a huge fan of Mendes, absolutely love his work, but was so let down by this movie. It stands to be one of the best produced world war 1 movie and on a technical stand point it should win some awards. They casted some great actors but pretty much put them in cameo roles.

Story was as straightforward as it gets, Germans were pretty much stormtroopers in terms of effectiveness, dialogue was uninteresting, and overall I didn't really have any investment in the characters or really felt the suspense as much. 

I feel like its a very Dunkirk-esque movie in terms of gritty realism, technical achievement, and pacing but failed to really get the audience as interested or invested as Dunkirk did. 

It also felt very shallow in terms as a war movie, especially from the SAME director as Jarhead. It didn't stand to say anything besides war-is-horrific. I wasn't expecting an All Quite on the Western Front but it really just showed a lot of horrific aftermath without really using it to cause any sort of interesting character development. The scene with the crying Captain was a neat touch but overall its a basic war movie.

Overall it felt almost Oscar baity",emi5z3
fe06vlu,"Just my personal thoughts: I thought the cinematography and the filming throughout the movie was incredible. The long tracking shots were so immersive and made it feel as if you're with them in the action. However, I think from a storytelling point of view this also makes things very difficult as you can really only track 1-2 people. After Blake dies, we are following Schofield, and again, from a storytelling perspective this makes things more difficult. Additionally, while the death of Blake was shocking and masterfully portrayed on screen, I felt it was the peak of the movie. The 2nd half of the movie lost its suspense/edge because we know Schofield is going to make it at least to the end of the film since we are watching a film centered around long tracking shots and he's the only character left in the film. The 2nd half of the film also felt a bit repetitive and predictable, and again, it lost its edge. I believe in the 2nd half of the film there are 2 scenes were Schofield was being chased while being shot at, and then the sniper scene where he's being shot at. All of these bullets are just missing him, and he's narrowly avoiding death each time. Masterfully captured visually? Yes, but it also never felt in my opinion that Schofield was actually in danger of being killed off.

Lastly, World War I was a frightening, brutal, and barbaric campaign. I thought the first half of the film 100% captured this, but did not feel the 2nd half did. The 2nd half felt very neat, and it all falls into place perfectly from Schofield narrowly avoiding being shot and killed 10+ times, to him surviving in the river, to being carried down the river right to where he needed to be to deliver the message, and then to actually delivering the message by avoiding dozens of bombs which landed so close to him that he should've been blown to pieces, and then finding Blake's brother in the middle of mayhem.

This will largely be an unpopular post, I understand that, but I'm comfortable sharing my opinion anyway. Visual masterpiece? Absolutely. But from plot wise I thought it left a lot to be desired, particularly in the 2nd half of the film.",emi5z3
fdt34wx,"Loved the movie but only two complaints, but I guess one of them is kinda big.

1. I wish that the scene with the french woman didn't have subtitles (American version). It doesn't really belong in this ""2 take"" film. 

2. I don't think that the German pilot would have stabbed the guy. From what I know, and it could be very wrong, the pilots were usually well respected and would be taken care of on either side. 

But, acting, pacing, cinematography, and score were all amazing. Definitely enjoyed the movie and that the big name actors weren't main characters.",emi5z3

fdpon0a,"I have mixed feelings on this. It's undoubtedly a technically flawless execution of Sam Mendes' vision, I just don't think it was a terribly interesting vision. It has moments that are as gripping and effective as in any war movie, but ultimately I found myself just not really caring about the characters, even when it takes the time to slow down and linger with them, which not enough war films usually do, and that made it really hard for me to be invested in it all that much. 
The constant tension of it just kind of got tiresome without an emotional core to grab onto, and I feel like the realtime nature of it contributed to that; when you only ever get to be with these characters when they are in a rush, you don't get a chance to know them very well.

I am genuinely curious though to see how it will play on a small screen. I'm worried though that it will be this year's *Gravity*: a big screen spectacle that when watched on a TV loses that effect, leaving you with not much of a story to grab onto. But still, I can't knock anyone besides Mendes himself, the cast and crew were all firing on all cylinders, I just wish they were putting this much expertise into a more interesting narrative. I'll be bummed though if this gets any more awards outside of technical categories, as I saw at least ten other movies this year that I thought were a lot stronger overall.

ff27cft,"So I think I made an interesting observation while watching the movie.

I think the writers wanted to show the dangers of man made. Every scene that was involved with horror, dread, or suspense were inside our around man made objects.

Dark building we're scary, bunkers we're booby trapped and almost killed both, the ruins of a town that once was is now a hellscape of potential murder.

The only scenes of true happiness and bliss was outside. The lush forests, the downed cherry trees, the fresh milk from the cow, the baby enjoying the touch of something living, the soldier singing in a peaceful forest.

I think this movie is more of a criticism of the things we are and what we have built over anything else.",emi5z3

ff2yfft,Surprised how so few people are commenting on the fact that they Germans couldn’t hit the broad side of the barn at any point in the movie.  It really took me out of it.  The majority of them ran around hip firing wildly while the main character simply ran in a straight line.  The first time I chalked it up to a horribly bad shooter.

Though some of the dialogue fell flat for me, there's no denying the achievement this film is. It accurately and rightfully depicts the horrors of war.

It also makes me hyper aware of where the hidden edits are. I was very impressed with how continuous the sets felt though. 

It's undeniably beautiful, and well shot, well acted. But, just not a lot happens, and the writing is fairly thin. I suppose the nature of the story means that's kind of destined, but, it's a bit of a bummer to mostly come away with the bog standard themes of every war movie and a lead (of whom was very well portrayed) who's arc is essentially 'doesn't want to go home because he's afraid of dying' to 'wants to go home'. 

Also, at some points if felt like a bit of a show reel for WW1 (and 2) tropes, in terms of the hidden french woman and baby, the singing of the troops, that sort of thing.

There’s some though that have kinda cliche Hollywood story that are highly rewatchable, imo.  Saving Private Ryan is a prime example for me, and I’m not knocking it cuz I really like it.",emi5z3

I’m the granddaughter of a war vet. Granted he was in WWII, not WWI. The ending of this movie brought me to tears. I cried for 20 minutes afterward. 

My grandfather was semi high ranking and had a safe desk job. He took a demotion voluntarily to go to the front lines and fight so he could watch over his brother and see him again. 
He survived the war and went on to become my hero and the happiest, most hard working and gentle person I’ve ever met. This year marks 10 years since he passed. 

Yeah have watched many military and war movies and none have ever hit me like this. 

The thought that he went through something similar to what I had just watched wrecked me.

fdul8jr,"Well done, awesome technical achievement with the long takes. Hats off to Roger Deakin once again. I came into it not knowing a lot and the first long take caught me by surprise. At first I thought it was a dolly shot, but I noticed the lack of track marks when they were walking in the mud. Steadicam FTW. I loved the shots in the burned out city with the flares overhead. Also was cool to get tricked into thinking the protagonist was going to die with all the ""I don't want to go back"" talk but was the one that ended up delivering the letter. The pace was great as well with the well-timed blackout and use of obstacles and objects as transitions. 

I do agree however, that it's a reverse Saving Private Ryan with elements from Dunkirk, War Horse, and other war movies. Also, the CGI rats, CGI milk cow, and CGI ""falling into the river"" sequence could have been done better. Solid 9.3/10.",emi5z3

fe4kjh2,"I've seen this twice now and I really liked it a lot. I've got it as my number 10 movie of 2019, and it's good enough that I won't be upset by any of the awards it takes home. The AMC theater I go to just added a Dolby Cinema screen, and my second viewing was the first movie I got to see on it, and on the huge screen with great sound this was among the best theater experiences I've ever had.

What I liked: The one-shot technique worked for me.  It really made the film more of an experience and really added to the tension and intensity. It's also shot beautifully, which really shouldn't surprise anyone who knows who Roger Deakins is. I haven't watched the featurette that's floating around yet about the cinematography but there are a few shots that just blew my mind as to how they did them. Schofield floating in the river is one, I assume they used a drone but it really felt like the camera was just floating alongside him, until it wasn't. I thought the performances were generally strong, if not outstanding. MacKay held his own when he was carrying the movie, and I thought Chapman was at his best in his death scene. I really liked Andrew Scott in his supporting role. In only about 3 minutes of screen time he really jumped off the screen. One moment I'm not sure I'd say I enjoyed but I think was incredible was during the No Man's Land scene when Schofield sticks his hand into the German soldier's gaping chest. I think I made an involuntary noise at that moment. And I think Blake's death scene is really well done, too.

What I didn't like: These are all pretty minor. I thought the movie didn't do a great job at showing the scale they traveled. I think there's an implied time jump before they get to the cherry orchard but it really feels like a short trip. And while there are plenty of justifications for it, the stormtrooper aiming got to be a little much on the second watch.

Overall this is a 9/10 for me. I need some time and distance to resolve the ""best war movie since Saving Private Ryan"" hype but I certainly liked this more on my first watch than I did Dunkirk.",emi5z3

fea2sqr,"I liked this movie, but it isn't your standard war movie. There's not a lot of combat, and it's built more on the suspense of will they make it in time vs. if they would survive combat. (Granted there are a few tense moments of if they would survive in general)

I thought the movie started out sort of slow, but then went lightning fast after the first 10 minutes. It is really impressive how you see the transition of scenery in the background go from green plains, to destroyed buildings and rubble, to a very muddy trench in the first 25 minutes of the film. I think it feels fast as well because of how there really was no ""lull"" in the film, it was just non-stop movement for the most part. 

The trailer does give away a lot of the major points in the film. But there are still a few surprises (and surprise cameos) that still make it a shock to see.",emi5z3

fjgn0r1,"Overall a very entertaining film however... really distracting because of the one shot technique - this took place in less than one full day? Issues :

* Distance; two guys cross no man's land in 20 mins on foot (unkown to be vacant) and almost immediately run into a whole battalion with fucking trucks. Didn't the guys 20 mins walk away know that the others had trucks (despite phone lines being down) and couldn't they just have got a lift with those guys at the start?

* Technique; kept losing focus due to the miraculous filming technique (not so much a complaint but distracting) - how did that camera follow them through trenches (and walls) with bridges? How did the camera get on and off the truck? Despite all the rehearsing required for such long scenes, why was the ground never trampled? Very well done but etc..

* Time; night to day - c'mon! When dude wakes up in full night time town battle it feels almost legit. But the switch to dawn half way down his river run and full daylight by the time he's running through the trenches again? It's only been another half an hour. I know this because i started watching the film at night and when it ended... it was still well and truely the same goddamn night!  

* Water; biggest gripe of all. Wet socks. Wet boots. Wet everything. Dry again in real time. Dude falls in a river and runs all the way downstream. Gets out soaking wet. Heavy Military garb from ""some unkown year in history"". Day is still as cold as it was when they were blowing out steam breath in the trenches when the film started. At the end of the film (10 - 15 mins later (only known because of stupid 1 shot technique)) He's totally dry and pulling out the dry, legible, un-ink-run letter to give to Cumbetsnatch. And if you're going to say ""ooh but he kept in a waterproof metal tin next to his heart"" well fuck that! At the end he pulls out photos - clearly undamaged by his trip down the rapids. Try getting fully dressed in winter clothes and getting into a full bath at this point in the movie, get out again and see if you're dry by the time the credits run.

So all said and done It was almost great. Few issues but very engaging. Could be that the 1 shot technique was just supposed to give us the impression of the calamity condensed into a bite sized piece. Seems more like it was a distraction because of some of the unrealistic, improbable, or completely impossible parts of the storytelling.",emi5z3
ff1b352,"A thread for the ""haters"": this film did nothing for me.  I've read every negative review searching for insights I might relate to, and I offer these as the best of those reviews.  From Manohla Dargis of the NYT:

*""What complicates the movie is that it has been created to look like it was made with a single continuous shot...The idea behind the camerawork seems to be to bring viewers close to the action...Mostly, though, the illusion of seamlessness draws attention away from the messengers, who are only lightly sketched in, and toward Roger Deakins’s cinematography and, by extension, Mendes’s filmmaking...you are always keenly aware of the technical hurdles involved in getting the characters from here to there...In another movie, such demonstrative self-reflexivity might have been deployed to productive effect; here, it registers as grandstanding.""*

*""\[Mendes\] seems far more interested in the movie’s machinery than in the human costs of war or the attendant subjects — sacrifice, patriotism and so on — that puff into view like little wisps of engine steam...""1917” remains a palatable war simulation, the kind in which every button on every uniform has been diligently recreated, and no wound, no blown-off limb, is ghastly enough to truly horrify the audience. Here, everything looks authentic but manicured, ordered, sane, sterile. Save for a quick appearance by Andrew Scott, as an officer whose overly bright eyes and jaundiced affect suggest he’s been too long in the trenches, nothing gestures at madness. Worse, the longer this amazing race continues, the more it resembles an obstacle course by way of an Indiana Jones-style adventure, complete with a showstopping plane crash and battlefield sprint.""*

I related a lot to this review about feeling my suspension of disbelief dying early on, and feeling particularly unengaged with the showstopper final charge (David Sims of The Atlantic):

*""The extended takes seem to exist to crank up the tension of their mission, forcing the story to progress in real time and conveying the feeling of a ticking clock. Mendes and Deakins’s visual achievement here is undeniable.  ""Yet mere minutes into the film, the gimmick begins to chafe. As the two boys are summoned into a briefing the camera dutifully hovers behind them as they walk through the trenches. After they receive their orders and head into battle, figuring out how Mendes will keep the action from cutting becomes a kind of photographic guessing game for the audience...There is no sense of real danger, because the mission has to continue, if only to keep this impressive long shot going. Any time there’s a larger, more cataclysmic set piece, our heroes look like tiny chess pieces on a much bigger board, bystanders who move around exploding mortars and whizzing bullets to produce the most stunning tableaux possible...""*

What is a good review?  For me, it is an essay that takes the viewers immediate visceral and intellectual reaction to something...and then attempts, however imperfectly, to explain why.  I had 4 simultaneous reactions to 1917: (1) I admired the technical achievement, (2) I felt completely uninvolved in the story; the camerawork stunt was so monumental that it was all I could think about, and it made sequences like the plane crash look too perfect to be suspenseful (3) I could obviously understand that the director was trying to bring us into the intimate experience of these soldiers,  and admired some moments like the cherry petal call-back and (4) I could easily imagine a smart, sensitive film person loving this film, and I wouldn't bother critizing it to someone who wasn't receptive and found it moving.  I felt odd and alienated by the applause and by my friends and relatives fawning praise for the film.  I wondered: did anyone around me feel as I did, but also thought, ""well, it's so impressive, and it's such a serious subject, so I think I need to like this thing...""

So I was gratified, just for the solidarity, to see some major critics saw exactly the same movie that I did: one that, in terms of character and themes and story, dissolved before our eyes, that, the day after (I saw it today) has entirely evaporated for me.  I felt about this entire film the same way I felt about the girl in the red dress in Schindler's List: in that moment, the storyteller became the star, and a story I was entirely invested in dissappeared until the moment was over.

Does anyone else relate to this, that the obviously most unique and cool thing about this film is exactly the thing that made it not work for you?  For those of you who 'disagree' (I don't think tat different visceral experiences, and the attempts to explain them, really is about rational argument), how to do you feel about this minority report of those who think that this was an amazing technical feat...but bad art?",emi5z3
fgolz3l,"When 50% of voters on the poll give it a perfect 10/10 all the top comments say it's the best war film ever made and possibly the best film of all time I have to question if everyone here is a paid shill or I was shown a different movie.

I'm not even a fan of the genre and I could reel off a heap of infinity better films in the genre, people honestly think 1917 is better than say Full Metal Jacket ?! Like really ?",emi5z3
fdqigzl,"I've got to be honest, the one-(or rather: two-)take approach just didn't click with me. Sure, it's a technical marvel and as such deserves praise, but it made the movie fall a bit flat on an emotional level. 

The thing is, the cinematography and all its elements (lighting, staging of set pieces, etc.) were all perfectly great, as you'd expect from Deakins, but the absence of cuts felt limiting in a way. Like a WWI-themed amusement park ride, the overarching feeling was more 'look at what we've managed to cram in this shot!' instead of 'look at the well-constructed story we've set up'.

By the time Schofield sits down against the tree at the end of the film, mirroring the opening shot, I was scared for a good couple of seconds that they were going to full Nolan and would loop the entire thing, and that he would just be summoned along by another soldier on a different mission.

It annoys me that I couldn't get past the technical display of force, because there are some excellent moments in the film (the sprint across no man's land and the moment of respite with the hiding woman and child were my personal highlights).",emi5z3
fdqtyx8,"I really enjoyed this. Big shout outs to MacKay, Deakins, and the production design (Dennis Gassner). They built what felt like miles of trenches and other sets. I’m not sure how much was computer-generated, but it looked and felt real.

I felt the movie really stepped into the next gear after the brief time skip. Running through the deserted city illuminated by flares, the filmmakers really embraced a more cinematic, fantastical approach. Allowing for a slight departure from pure realism gave us some gorgeous lighting and color grading. 

I also loved the scene where Schofield goes over the top. I listened to a podcast with Sam Mendes, and apparantly MacKay falling was unscripted, but they all just cheered him on to keep running. Wonderful scene.

I did have critiques. The movie never pulled me in emotionally as much as Dunkirk, and the tension never felt as high, despite the single-shot gimmick. Why? A few reasons. Dean-Charles Chapman gave a serviceable performance, but he was never more than “okay”. The script in the first half was a bit lackluster. Very exposition-heavy (“Must be something big going on if the general is here!”). But most importantly, the film does feel overly structured. Our characters are railroaded from setpiece to setpiece. It almost feels like a videogame at points (I mean that as a criticism). Edit: the film also loses realism in this way. You really have to suspend belief that all of these vignettes (which are probably pulled from real-life stories) happened to the same person within a span of about 12 hours. The scene with the mother, baby, and milk kinda lets you know that 1917 isn’t really about gritty realism.

But those things didn’t take away from the film too much. I still loved it, and it’s a tremendous achievement for Mendes and Deakins. They deserve the prizes which they will surely win.",emi5z3
fdrr8bm,"Amazing movie, my only criticism is the appearance of a bunch of very famous British actors throughout. It broke my immersion every time. Especially when Benedict appeared. It was just so unnecessary to cast this insanely recognizable face for a little 3 minute appearance. He wasn't advertised in the marketing so it's not like they needed these people to make an appearance. Keep it all down to no-names and keep us fully immersed in the nightmare. Btw I hope those 2 main heroes break out after this, they were great. Especially George McKay.",emi5z3
fds9n1b,"To echo the majority, this movie is very very well done. One scene I haven’t seen talked about much but really got me was when Scofield was walking through the destroyed town and spots a soldier across the plaza, the soldier starts to slowly walks towards him.

fejcper,"I was generally satisfied by 1917, but anyone saying it’s the best war movie they’ve ever seen must not have seen too many. I’d rate Dunkirk and Fury over this by far.

My main issue is, the film seems to have been conceived by cinematography and not by story. Basically a producer said let’s make a war movie that is filmed as one cut in a never ending stream of action. Sticking to this concept seems to have been far more important than developing a plot with any complexity. Not to mention that about 1/3 of the movie was the protagonist(s) running through trenches with the same tightly framed motion sickness style.",emi5z3

They start on the British side of No Man's Land, cross into the German side, meet British soldiers who I guess came from either East or West after also crossing, drive a couple miles, come across a town with some German soliders, go down the river and find the huge British battalion rushing at Germans ever further away.

How was that huge British battalion so deep in German territory if the German front had soliders only 2 days prior and the British didn't know they left? The distance from where the movie started and ended was 9 miles I belive they said, that's not very far, the way they were dug in with trenches made it would seem like the British battalion at the end was there for a couple days, so how did the Germans who left the front line not run into them?",emi5z3
fe87nel,"An extremely well-made movie. The actors were all terrific. The music and sound editing were awesome. The realism of the trenches was awesome.

My only criticism - the one-take editing with the single-person shooter perspective made it seem almost videogame-like, but with the necessary time condensation (the events of the day condensed to the movie's run time) made some incidents seem illogical. For example, after a character leaves a platoon and crosses a river, he starts getting shot at, but the platoon doesn't return the fire or come to his rescue. We're to understand that 'time has passed, he is alone,' but because we literally just saw him leave the truck and BANG, a rain of bullets, it doesn't make sense.",emi5z3

fe6wsgp,"Surprised everyone in this thread seemed to love it. I was very much looking forward to seeing this, as I absolutely loved Dunkirk and the trailer looked pretty great. Unfortunately the trailer showed basically every action scene and almost told the whole story. 

I absolutely loved the first hour or so and I was so so excited and expectant for what was to come however the ending felt really tacky and cheap. Apparently they had to go 9 miles and it seemed like barely 3 or 4 by the end of it, the city section was atrocious - lots of running in a straight line down streets but of course our hero doesn't get shot. 

When so much brilliant set and costume design, acting, etc goes into making a film I find it so infuriating to be let down by an overly cheap story where everything suddenly breaks right for the protagonist. The whole jumping into the river and miraculously ending up 50 metres from his destination was the icing on the cake. 

I think the appeal of the 'one shot' movie worked really well for the opening hour and then maybe became a limiting factor in really adding extra context and depth to the more intense scenes later on. I feel like I watched a cinematic masterpiece which was gorgeous from start to finish, but I felt absolutely no attachment to any of the characters or overall plot.

>!The film is definitely a technical masterpiece for its smart use of practical and SFX to appear to be one continuous take.

But it’s the commitment to that trick that harmed the story for me. Lots of implausible things happen just so they can keep doing that. Some scenes are complete quiet and serene then the characters walk a few feet into a whole regiment of soldier’s or a massive battle.

Stuff like that took me out of the movie completely.

I did like how they switched up the trailer ‘run’ so as not to spoil the movie.!<

fdwkq0c,"My praises: 

Cinematography - Continuous shot method was amazing, some clever editing points. 

Visual imagery - Showed the horrors of the war. Had Schoffield floating lazily down a river with blossom falling around him to moments later having to scramble over bloated corpses.  

Acting - was top notch from all involved. 

Score- Very Nolan-esque with the approach, fit incredibly well with the visuals. 

My complaints: 

Character development was virtually non existent. Hinted at Schofield’s experience with the Somme. Didn’t go anywhere. Colonel played by Cumberbatch seemed to be a lot easier to persuade than what was teased. 

Historical accuracy wasn’t much a concern I feel at times. In particular showing a regiment/company of soldiers from varying parts of England, not to mention a single colonial troop. Regiments were made up of men from their villages/towns/cities etc. That’s why Blake and Schofield had to get word to the Devoners. 

A logical complaint, Schofield departs the convoy and moments later goes to cross the broken bridge, he is then shot at. The sniper/German element in the town would have taken shots at the convoy as a whole.",emi5z3

fhrksx9,"Saw it tonight. Thought the first half was strong yet it got a bit messy and redundant towards the end. Performances were strong, cinematography was great. The continuous shot format sometimes helped and hurt the movie I felt. 

There were a lot of scenes that were over-scored by Thomas Newman, particularly the sniper scene that would have been more intense without music if it hadn't given us any room to breathe, along with various other bits that were orchestrated in a very generic modern ""pulsating action music"" sort of way that really hurt the uniqueness of the movie for me. Newman, while a great film scorer by his own right wasn't the best choice for this type of movie I don't think. 

I think it lost it's way in the last half and resorted to war-movie cliches. A little more time with the two leads would have helped a lot, as I think the one who died should have gotten closer to to the end. 

It wasn't mind blowing for me, but it was solid. I give it a 7.5/10. Not the best war movie ever made and not the worst, definitely above average.

Edit: Just wanted to add that Children of Men did the continuous shot a lot better, not necessarily on a technical level but because of the very fact that the whole movie wasn't shot that way. It used it when it needed to and elevated those scenes because you didn't notice it as much, it seamlessly went from one format to another without being jarring.",emi5z3

ff2lgkh,"I liked the movie overall. The first half was a masterpiece of tension and suspense but some scenes in the second half were pretty cringy.

The scene with the woman and baby was pretty unnecessary and not credible. As a Frenchman myself, I thought the french woman acted horribly. Chances that one would find a woman with a lost baby hidden in a town of the frontline would be close to 0 in 1917 (it's WWI, not WWII). Odds that this woman would speak and understand a bit of English would be negative.",emi5z3

fdpwewg,"I have been farming and building cottages for the greater part of the last three decades, and have stood in the crowd for many a performance about war, but this was something unique to the senses.

The story itself reminded me of the tale of ""*the lord of the rings""* in its simplicity - two young men (Sam and Frodo) are sent to deliver a message (the one ring) across enemy lines (beyond the gates of Mordor)...etc - *1917* picks up right from the beginning of the story, and never really lets up until the final act. There are moments to catch your breath embedded throughout the performance, but there's so much ongoing tension and an ever-present sense of urgency that it never really feels like there's time to relax for more than a minute here and there.

I do want to clarify that the story was directed to appear as though only two major scenes took place. There is a definitive point of intermission that everyone will spot, but all other breaks between scenes will only be spotted by those keen of eye. A tree may appear in the foreground for just a split second, or the light may go out when a character enters underground for the briefest of moments...etc. These brief transition devices are embedded throughout the show, but if you're not paying attention they will seamlessly pass you by. All of the other peasants in attendance were convinced that it all took place within two highly-choreographed 60 minute windows of time - so it was highly effective *magic -* but I spotted at least a dozen hidden places that allowed for breaks if needed.

That being said, you should experience this live if you can - as it deserves to be seen on a big stage.

I also want to touch on the comparisons i've heard to *Saving Private Ryan* \- as many have been eager to compare the two stories by calling 1917 ""the next *Saving Private Ryan"",* and I want to state that this is not *Saving Private Ryan*. Aside from both performances being about war, there are virtually no similarities between the two, and they each deserve separate praise and recognition. I do believe that 1917 will be in many peasant's ""top 5"" listings for theatrics about war, but it is a standalone production.

Without further adieu, let's jump to this knave's no-BS breakdown and final rating:

**Storytelling:** It's a story we've heard before, but there's nothing wrong with that. The problem with the writing of 1917 is with the lack of information provided. Most movies will spoon-feed you every detail, so it's refreshing to not be told asinine things like ""we're in a war"" during any part of the film, however - there was a severe lack of character and relationship building that you're just expected to accept/interpret and be thrust into the middle of.

**Direction:** Sam Mendes created nothing short of a cinephile's wet dream with this one. There is so much detail and choreography instilled into every single shot taking place that it will no doubt beg for multiple viewings just to see everything that was happening in the background of most scenes. I mention the scene transitions, and how its shot to appear as though it was done in just two takes - with a clearly defined halfway point - however, I don't necessarily know how much this choice added to the film. Make no mistake, it was amazing to watch take place, and there were certainly moments of tremendous buildup and tension due to never letting up, but there were also a lot of quiet places and pauses throughout, as the movie itself was not a *gung ho* action film. There is actually very little *action* as much as there is *tension* throughout the film. So while there are *tense* moments from start to finish, the actual *action* \- as in bullets flying and explosions taking place - only took place in a handful of sequences - and of those sequences - only one involved more than one or two people on the screen at once. If you're expecting a grim ""*war is hell*"" film with people dying left and right while holding in their entrails, or being blown to pieces - you've got the wrong idea. This is a much more ""what you don't/didn't see is scary"" type of war thriller. So while what Sam Mendes has done will be sensational for the senses, I couldn't help but be reminded of Quentin Tarantino's choice to film *Hateful 8* on 70mm, but then set the entire film indoors; a wonderful idea on paper, but a strange choice of story/setting to apply such a wonderful idea to.

**Pacing:** The pacing is a mixed bag. The movie picks up immediately, but there are slow down points embedded throughout. The pacing itself wouldn't be a problem if character development were constantly taking place, but there is very little time spent developing either of the two major characters, or their relationship, between scenes. It's clear that the two are friends, and maybe even best friends, but outside of that assumption - there's really not much more depth ever explored. This was the weakest part of the film, as it made it difficult to genuinely care when impactful situations were taking place.

**Acting:** The acting was fine all around. Both of the male leads - Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay - acted primarily using body language and facial expressions, but the conversations that did take place were fine, and both actors did a terrific job.

**Sound:** I want to see the film again for this aspect alone - not because it blew me away, but because I really don't recall anything score-related outside of a single scene that was sung a cappella near the end. I remember thinking halfway through that the film really would have benefited with someone like Zimmer at the helm of the soundtrack, but Thomas Newman has worked with Mendes in the past (*Spectre*), so they may have their own Nolan/Zimmer-esque relationship on movie projects. That being said, I don't think the score was all that memorable outside of ""Wayfaring Stranger"" (the song from the trailer) - sung by Jos Slovick.

\--

**Final Verdict:** 8.5/10

This was an amazing film to watch in theatre, with a simple plot to follow, and wonderful cinematography to experience. The acting was great, and the sets/choreography were executed beautifully. The film does suffer from it's pacing and immediacy, as this does result in a lack of depth to the development of it's major characters - which unfortunately weakened several serious moments throughout. The music isn't too memorable outside of the performance of ""Wayfaring Stranger"", and while I thoroughly enjoyed how the film was edited, I can't help but wonder if the choice to edit the film as though it were shot in two takes was really necessary - given that the direction and overall lack of action didn't really allow for the audience to experience the full scope of what that type of editing can showcase in movies with more grand/complicated action sequences.

fdxvfsv,"I hear the complaints, but this is a 1 day story, so not sure how realistic it is to do a better plot for a single-shot style than this, in a 2-hour movie?

I like to see those complained try it out themselves. Or pitch it to a filmmaker to make your idea, and we will judge!

The point of this movie is an effective single-shot style beautifully-shot Thriller. Not a convoluted story in a 2 hours that leaves many topics discussed unanswered!

Maybe if this movie was 3+  hours instead of 2 then a more complex story could be done.

ffszz22,"After coming out the German trap that almost killed them, why did Schofield and Blake shoot the flare (supposedly a signal for their men to rescue them), but then they immediately continued their mission?

Also Schofield walking up that abandoned house after the broken bridge where a German was sniping him was like walking to his death. Lots of plot armour there, and he could at least use his grenade.",emi5z3
fdpmm1l,Just a personal opinion but story wise I thought it was a bit meh. Perhaps due to the fact that one of the main characters died early and so there was a lack of dialogue compared to other movies. However visually and technically it was an insane film. There were so many times throughout the film where I was just thinking how on earth did they (the filmmakers) do that??,emi5z3
fdrb5f9,"Totally understand why lots of people love it because it is a technical marvel but it doesn't serve the story enough to justify being approached in this manner, if anything it was more detrimental

So much more is achieved when you set up.story-board a scene to depict different angles as to convey what the audience should be perceiving from the story. Editing is also one of the biggest elements in ramping up tension, normally in tandem with the musical score. That doesn't mean rapidly cutting to the point of imcomprehension of course but it's in the cutting room where you decide which shots needs to breathe or require brevity. But when you just let the camera roll for what just feels like the sake of it, I can't help but feel I'm watching someone make a film rather than watching a film. It felt like either a theme park ride or watching someone else play a videogame to me, on rails and with that extra barrier in front of me for full immersion.

I think it's telling that the best shot in the film is right after that >!cut to black after Schofield gets shot down the stairs. !<What follows is an incredible pan through the upper house out the window into a crane shot of the town on fire, then transitioning down onto Schofield as he runs through intermittent blackouts due to the flares. They were able to achieve this as they were no longer reliant on the transition needing to be perfectly synced up with the shot prior. Deakins was given a clean reset like practically all other film and it shows how much it benefitted the film more.",emi5z3
fdz938z,"First half was outstanding. Following the two through NML and the deserted trenches. That death scene had to be one of the hardest hitting I've seen in s long time.

But rigth after that. It became far more Hollywood. Like the battalion literally showing up minutes after his mate needed urgent medical support. Or some random women with a kid...who happens to just need the milk he just happened to carry. The film also lost alot of its edge. After his death you knew scholfied was going to get to the end.

ffws4xt,"I finally saw 1917 today, and in IMAX.  

I thought it was a great movie experience.

But I also felt like I was at one of those video game streaming sites where you watch the screen of someone playing a video game.  Because, like a video game, it's all ""one take"", it has boss battles, has obstacles, tunnels, traps, river, waterfalls, and interactions with people you encounter.  So it's exactly like a first or third person shooter.  :) 

 And the ""one take"" started to feel gimmicky, besides which you could tell when the cuts were done (anytime a rock or tree or something came into the foreground to block the view).

I don't think the ""one take"" added much, in fact I thought it detracted from the movie.  Using multiple cuts would have made it seem more like a movie and less like a game.

That said, I still put it in my top 5 for 2019.  Behind Jojo, Parasite, John Wick 3, and Uncut Gems.",emi5z3

I was waiting for Schofield to get shot the whole first half of the movie, since he was the grizzled veteran from the Somme. Seeing Blake get stabbed by the pilot was a real shock for me. It was also beautiful how the shot was centered on both of them even after he died. When the camera decides to start following just Schofield, it really conveyed the feeling of leaving Blake behind that Schofield must have also felt.

Also, after the sniper house scene I remembered that they were given grenades before leaving their trench. That might have come in handy during that scene, since it would have prevented him from getting shot and blacking out 12 hours.",emi5z3

Long takes are great. The first one here is awesome and well-executed, as was the shot of him exiting the river and watching the guy singing. I totally get why it seemed like a good idea because of how it immerses you into the story, but I just don't think it works as well as if it's a ""normal"" movie with a few long takes. There were moments that screamed for a cut.

One of my favorite scenes was when he encountered the woman and baby in the bombed city, and the tone and pace of the dialogue and the camera make the scene feel longer -- it was one of the few times in the film where I wasn't actively aware of the camera moving. You could argue that this proves the effectiveness, but I'd go the other way: it proves you didn't need it. Very rarely in the film did I think the scenes were benefiting from the style. 

Still a very good movie. The rat tripping the wire got me. The death of Blake genuinely surprised me. George MacKay did as much as he could. Deakins is The King of Movies. I was concerned about stunt-casting but Madden was wonderful and I loved the way Cumberbatch was written.",emi5z3

fdu05ye,"The scene with the pilot really, really bugged me. They showed mercy to this guy and saved his life, Tom even discounts Will's suggestion to ""put him out of his misery"", and then what happens? Tom gets killed. wtf.

Like I get it, war is bad, bad things happen to good people in war, there's no honor in war, yada yada. This scene really bothered me though because it just seemed so out of character. I'm no expert on WWI but my perception is that pilots were generally gentlemen when it came to playing fair in war, and especially you would think getting saved from death by burning would make you a little grateful, so how does it make any sense for this pilot to try to kill the people who just saved him?

I realize the movie needed Tom to die in order for the time jump to work, but they could have killed off Tom in any other way, like friendly fire from the British soldiers who arrived on scene or even some random piece of shrapnel, and it would have made more sense. Having him die at the hands of someone he just saved seems unnecessarily cruel and also unlikely.

OK, you might say ""oh well it's pretty unlikely for a plane to crash right in front of you"" but that's something I can suspend my disbelief for, not this. It's the same gripe I had with ""Saving Private Ryan"".

fehv1sv,"I had some real problems with this movie. I think the way that it is shot, while beautiful, really detracts from the movie.

It tends to focus all on the face of the actors. This really limits the scope of what the audience is able to see. There are very few times when we get the opportunity to see what the actors are seeing. This makes it much harder to process what they are thinking. During the river scene all I could think about was why he wasn't swimming towards the bank that we could see that clearly wasn't covered in dead bodies.

The continuous shots really distort the passing of time in the movie. The front is just a five minute aggressive walk away? The distance covered in the truck could have been used to explain away ~7 of the 8-9 miles they needed to cover, but they were probably going max about 20 MPH, and since we heard the talking of the other soldiers the entire time there is no way that happened. He also gets knocked out for at least 8 hours. I don't even know if it is possible to survive that.

The only way I can really justify his actions in the post knocked out part of the movie is that he just got a massive concussion that makes him act extremely erratically. I don't think this is in any way conveyed through the actual movie, but is the only way I can rationalize all the dumb shit he did.

I think the fact that the hand wound or the grenades weren't relevant to the plot was stupid. The milk was. Seems inconsistent that the other foreshadowed things weren't.",emi5z3

Edit: Thinking more about it, the two characters motivations was very clear but nothing new or very engaging from a plot perspective. From the trailers and general flow of the film it was very apparent how each scene would play out other than the brother dying. From that point it was clear exactly the conversation he would have with the older brother on the line.

Why are we calling it a one take movie? I am not trying to be snarky about how there were clearly hidden edits, I mean there is actually an edit when Geroge Mackay blacks out, screen goes to black, and then it is night time. How is that not an ""official edit""?

Who milked the cow?

How did Schofield not see a caravan of british soldiers coming as Blake was dying? No,""Hang in there Blake, I see the army coming""... Also, how did they get there? This huge deal was made about them getting across no mans land but then all of sudden 4 army trucks loaded with soldiers show up.

How did every soldier in the German army not know how to aim a rifle? The shooting was confidingly bad.

So, Schofield encounters the drunk german and the younger one just before dawn, right? Why were they getting blitzed at 5ish am??

How is it that Schofield runs about a mile to get to Mackenzie  but only needs to walk about 25 yards to reach the casualty tent. (The geography of this scene was certainly to satisfy the one take as did so much of this film).

I don't understand how anyone survives the explosion in the cave, but willing to suspend disbelief here.

The first scene as they emerge from the trenches to the desolation spread out in front of them was magnetic. Combined with the ""one long take"" method led to a film that mostly did a very good job of immersing you into that time period.

- There is a specific scene at the end as our remaining hero runs across a battle-charge which was also very cool, despite the somewhat rough use of green screen.

- Performances weren't Oscar-worthy but definitely good enough to not hinder the rest of the film.

- Music similarly was fine if not outstanding. However, I do wonder what this film would have sounded like without music. To have the sounds to match the stunning visuals could have been special.

- The death of our one of our two heroes was surprising as I was pretty sure the other one would die. I like it when my expectations are subverted.

Cons

- It's funny, because I watched The Gentlemen a few days ago and one of my take aways from that film was that it got a lot better when people started shooting each other. This film, conversely, got a lot worse when people started shooting each other. It wasn't far off being magnificent when it was just two (and sometimes one) soldier exploring the desolation caused by war. When it became a soldier fighting other soldiers in a war, the film stretched credibility with Nazi target practice clearly being insufficient as they missed most of their shots whilst our protagonist ended up having a far higher shot-to-hit ratio. A few scenes when our soldier runs away, directly in a straight line, from a German soldier who still contrives to miss his shots really breaks the immersion of the film.

- I also like balanced portrayals, which I thought I would get when they humanised some of the German soldiers in the first trench, with the photos of family left behind. However, the Germans were nearly all back stabbing (sometime front stabbing) evil-doers and the English were nearly all honourable food-donating German-soldier-saving baby-savers.

Overall, 8/10.",emi5z3
fdpdxqw,"I see why it won best score at the Globes. When it score swells, it's so fucking incredible. That mixed with Deakin's visuals made some of the most memorable and gorgeous moments I've seen in a movie. Mendes really out together a crack team for this movie and it turned out incredibly. Man, 2019 was one hell of a year from movies and it's still going.

Edit: nevermind, I remembered it differently and Joker won. Still I see why the score is getting nominations and attention.",emi5z3
fdpfso4,"I really enjoyed this movie and I genuinely don’t know how they did some of it. 

But seeing this sub fall in love with it when it crapped on Dunkirk is very strange to me.",emi5z3
fdqn3cg,"The one take with hidden cuts was enjoyable to watch but the movie didn't quite hit me in the same way it did for other viewers. Decided to watch Gallipoli (1981) later and one thing I notice is it lacks that gut-punch moment that the most noteworthy war movies have. 


I think it needed the focus other war films have, Stalingrad, Wooden Crosses or Jarhead. The visuals are great to have but if there is no lasting impact than it ends up like Dunkirk (2017) or Hacksaw Ridge. It just fizzles in the last half, lacking the tension from earlier. However, the move does an excellent job of capturing the various aspects of WWI on the front-line.",emi5z3

And Fury was my shit man. But the cinematography, acting, environment, everything was just wtf. Was holding my breathe the entire time till he was able to just sit back down at a tree again. That visual right there killed me, like damn and that was all 1-2 days for Scho. I can't imagine the people actually in the military dealing with things of this measure everyday or even having to WORRY about it everyday.

Shit is crazy.",emi5z3
fdymzm8,Damn. 2020 might have it’s best film after just one week.,emi5z3
fe0ai3x,"Just saw this and absolutely loved it. Probably this best film of the year for me so far. I’m hoping someone can help me figure out some time/distance discrepancies though.

At the beginning of the film, they said it would probably take them 6-8 hours to get to where they needed to be. But because the camera in theory never “cuts”, we are seeing their mission in real time and in actual distance. Ignoring the amount of time Schofield is knocked out, the whole trek takes like an hour and a half or so (with multiple delays) and the total distance they travelled was probably not much more than a few miles or so.

Is this an error in the film or are there some things I’m missing? I was thinking that maybe like the time spent traveling in the vehicle is meant to represent a couple of hours and several miles, even though from our view it’s only a few minutes, but I’m not really sure. Would love a proper explanation if there is one.",emi5z3

feh0j5r,"Am I the only one who didn't 100% love it? The acting from the 2 leads was great, especially when Blake is stabbed, and it was a technical masterpiece, but I found it incredibly boring. I kept checking the time and I almost never do that. 6/10.",emi5z3
fdu2pdk,Technically impressive but aside from that I thought it was only okay. It failed to capture any emotion.,emi5z3
fewjvub,"Anyone else feel underwhelmed? Beautiful, don’t get me wrong, but it felt kind of lacking in a message. When Schofield and Blake argue about the value of a medal, I thought that’d be more fleshed out, but once Blake dies, I felt really bored with the rest of the movie. It’s pretty easy to predict the ending, so I just spent the rest of the film trying to find where the they did the cuts. 

When movies like Parasite come out that just make you leave the theater uncomfortable and thinking for days, I honestly couldn’t say the same for this movie besides “that one-shot thing was pretty cool.” I thought a lot about the scene where he finds the woman and baby, and I just felt that scene could have been better narratively. Part of the message I was assuming through the first half was how tired and frightened Schofield after experiencing so much during the war, and yet he trusts that woman so easily. Maybe if it felt more like him clinging to his humanity, I could have said something more about this film, but it just felt like a insignificant break between the main character running from Germans with bad aim. 

Maybe the message is about how bad war is, but at this point, there’s been a hundred saying the same thing in similar ways. Again, visually beautiful, but just left me wishing for more substance.",emi5z3
fef43e7,"I love the cinematography and all the technical aspects as well as the set design keeping true to Historical accuracy of uniforms etc... however this movie really lacks a plot. I think some of it is because of the one long tracking shot premise but I just felt it fell flat because of it. I know I’m probably in the minority but there were just too many unbelievable moments and schofield never got hurt... trip wire explosion only dust in the eyes, sent down a rapid and slams a rock but comes out fine, gets shot and concussed for hours and  wakes up hours later and is fine. I love war movies but it just felt like 2 hours of watching a guy run over and over with a very weak plot and character development.",emi5z3
fg692p9,"I saw the movie yesterday and I am a bit disappointed. To be fair, I am not really into world war movies so I did not expect to be blown away by this movie but I still expected it to be better after reading so many good reviews about it. 

First of all, the movie def does not look like it was shot in a single take. There were many obvious cuts- I spotted at least 20 cuts throughout the movie. I gotta agree the visuals were stunning though. 

Secondly and this is my biggest issue the story was really dull and full of cliches (finding the family member of the fallen soldier at the end of the movie etc.) with bad dialogues. The main character was mainly a glorification of a soldier. His friend was stabbed by a german pilot and after this experience, he still did not want to kill the german soldier at first but put his hand on his mouth and told him to be quiet- while on the other side of course the german soldiers were all evil human beings. 

He also had too much plot armor. He had no scratch on his body after he was buried by all these rocks caused by an explosion next to him. He dodged more bullets than Neo in ""Matrix"" and he conveniently always found the right way. I also don't get the scene with the woman and the baby. It felt out of place and I wondered why he was not concerned about the german soldier anymore who was probably searching for him after he escaped from him only a few seconds earlier.",emi5z3
fdpdsfm,"I was already really enjoying it, and then the farm sequence sent me over the top. So well paced, and such a good use of the one-shot technique, it gives you such a tangible sense of space and time.",emi5z3
fdpfhdc,"Wow, I was just searching for a discussion thread half an hour ago and didn't see one. Good thing I tried again.

I saw it on a regular screen and felt I was missing out on some better picture quality. The contrast was a bit weak on some of the darker scenes where I viewed it. Beautifully shot film though. I might watch it again in a better theater.

Avoided all trailers and plot going in so I was a little disappointed that the movie focused more on the emotional stage rather than the scale of the war. That's fine though, I was more than happy with how this ended up. Didn't even know the film was going for a continuous shot going in so the first 15 minutes I kept thinking to myself, ""wow this is an impressive take...and it's still going.""

There were two moments that stuck out to me in terms of the set and putting me into the war zone. The first was when they showed piles of spent shells from their cannons after they got out of the tunnels. The second was when a mass of men started charging the field. The smaller scenes were pretty, but they had a claustrophobic atmosphere to them and I was expecting a big budget movie to play more with shelling and being barraged in trenches and mud. I understand it would take away from the intent of the film, but maybe this will spark some more interest in WWI movies.

I'll admit I was hyped for this mainly because I had listened to the Dan Carlin podcast a year ago (Blueprint for Armageddon) and had these crazy images in my head that yearned to see a modern adaptation on screen.",emi5z3

I could have sworn it was based on a true story, so I was waiting for images of everyone to appear at the end. Still a fun time even if it was mostly fictional.

Nice to see the Sherlock actors together in something good for once haha.",emi5z3
fdpmfpd,I can’t wait to see the behind the scenes on this movie. Like how many shots do you think they take per scene? Some of those were literally 10+ minutes if I remember correctly(watched it a couple weeks ago.) Easily my favorite war movie the last 5-10 years.,emi5z3
fdpn0rw,"Went and saw this on Christmas here in LA. Even posted [an early review thread at the same time] (https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/efpuwb/1917_early_review/). Basically my thoughts summed up are:

- An incredibly well made movie that was well directed by Sam Mendes.

- You can tell when the cuts happen but the aesthetic of a ""one take"" film holds up really well

- REALLY enjoyed the twist where Dean-Charles Chapman dies like, 30mins in. Rest of the story is kinda ""meh"" and predictable. But they did a good job swerving us into thinking it was Chapman's movie when it reality it is MacKay's.

- Speaking of MacKay, he did a great job and I'll push him for an Oscar nomination. Boy did he have to do a lot of running in this.

- One problem with the film, as mentioned earlier, is that overall story and message are pretty basic. You see one war movie you've pretty much seen the messages they want to send. I do appreciate how, even though Schofield did ""save"" the day; a lot of people still died and there is so much more to happen with this war. So it isn't like Schofield ""won the war"" or anything like that.

- My only real problem with this film was how the Germans are portrayed in this. Don't get me wrong, they were ""the bad guys"" for the Brits so I understand they are the villains. But if there is one war in all of history where we know all soldiers involved really had no ""good or evil"" side it is WWI. So to see all the Germans involved here just outright evil, and not at least morally ambiguous whenever crossing Schofield's path was a bit annoying.

Overall, I think it's a very good film and highly recommend people watch it. But I can also see this as easy ""Oscar bait"" in some ways so people might get upset if this thing gets nominated up the ass in a couple weeks. Wouldn't surprise me if, by a split vote, this wins Best Picture because how well this film works for everyone.",emi5z3
fdppsu8,"At the beginning of 1917 when Schofield and Blake are walking through the trench and finally meet Lieutenant Leslie, that appeared to be a single long shot throughout the whole trench. I don't recall any breaks in that initial walk through the trench shot where they could have stitched together two or more shots. It seemed like one whole shot with no possible breaks.

That was really impressive. That was a long trench so it must have taken lots of time to set up that trench, plus the coordination involved with the other background actors",emi5z3

Quick question for anyone reading, as I didn't completely understand when I watched: what caused Schofield to get knocked down the stairs when he finished off the German sniper? It seemed like they both fired at the same time, but Schofield didn't have a bullet wound, right? My understanding was that his head injury was from landing at the bottom of the stairs, which is what knocked him out. Just not sure how he ended up down there.",emi5z3

feu8n3l,This is a weird thing but for some reason that scene where he is running through the town with the flares the music sounded like the national anthem from the Hunger games movies.

ffqijer,"How much was the area compressed for the movie compared to what it would've really been like back then? Like, did they heavily compress it to shorten the timeline so that it could be done in one shot, or was it more or less accurate? Scofield running into those guys right after Blake died seemed especially egregious to me.",emi5z3
ff3r53h,"The film was fascinating, I like how they didn't try to make the cuts between each one shot scene too obvious or too real. It shows that they understood that they couldn't do the movie in just one single scene. Overall though, the movie was really good, it really did tell the story of two men, messengers to be in fact, who saved 1600 men, all from two whole battalions. It showed what men from the first world war had to go through and it showed the hardships, indignities and stress. It was as sad as Endgame in my opinion because most of these guys had no idea why they were in that war, and the only reason why they were in it was because fat old men were back in their homeland conflicting with other countries. They just wanted to go back home and live their best lives. Good job Sam Mendes.",emi5z3

Yes, it's stated in the beginning that less is more but after the first half of the movie, it feels  a bit bland in that you know nothing extreme will happen to Scofield as he's going to end up delivering the letter in the first place. The amount of times he should've died but came off relatively unscatched hampered the imersion for me.

The end of the movie was great though, it's the parts in-between >!Blake dying!<  and after he comes out the river that don't do the movie justice.

feadpep,"4/5: Genuinely liked the film and the underwhelming (for lack of better word) combat and scrappy fights/chases was more harrowing and sad to watch as you can put yourselves in individuals shoes better.

Loved the way it was filmed, made there feel tension even in motions of respite and constantly looking out for the characters. BUT... my God, this film is the biggest showcase for why 24fps isn't enough.

A constantly moving camera with tonnes of short pans made it a juttery and blurry mess to begin. Adjusted after about 20-30 minutes but it completely detracted from the filming style.

Oscar worthy film, Oscar worthy performances, if this doesn't get nods then I honestly dont understand that awards system. 

Oh, and the running scene at the end, the one hinted at in the trailers, is arguably my favourite movie scene ever. Incredible. I do not understand how filmmakers do it.",emi5z3
fdpxazn,Definitely less action than everyone was expecting. The human emotion really shined where the mood was just so dreadful accompanied by a enjoyable score. Technically brilliant but the story line and some points of immersion didn't quite hit full satisfaction,emi5z3
fdy0uyi,"It's a solid movie. I feel like the one shot gimmick hurt it a bit especially when it came to the writing and even some of the blocking. Most of the dialogue was a character being like ""look at this thing"" as if the audience isn't already looking at it. I guess that comes from the fact that they are showing all of the parts that would normally be edited out like all of the walking and needed some sort of dialogue to act as filler. I'm glad that the movie was able to distinguish itself from other war movies. The trailers and posters really made it look like a Dunkirk rip off but it wasn't, the movies are totally incomparable. I'd give it a 4/5.

&#x200B;

Edit: Also a super super small thing that bothered me was him being able to fire like 10 rounds at the German while crossing the broken bridge without reloading, when they earlier showed him loading the rifle with a 5 round clip. I always appreciate films showing reloading like in John Wick and with the film being shot as a long take, its something that should have been included in that moment especially with the goal of realism in this film. Think it builds tension too because for even a few moments the character is vulnerable and can't fire back.",emi5z3

fds7gdq,"Technically, the movie was amazing. The ""one shot"" concept worked and didn't seem forced. All of the usual war movie tropes were absent. The plot was varied, and it uses its time perfectly. Each of the locations were visually distinct, allowing you to feel the progress through the movie. Even the downtime felt exactly as long as it needed to be. The score was.. unobtrusive? It didn't really make a mark for the vast majority of the movie. Even though I'm not a fan, Ed Sheeran's song was beautiful and perfectly placed. The volume of the rifles was alarming, which helped punctuate the danger characters were in. The scene with Schofield running through advancing infantry was the best in the movie. 

Unfortunately, I had serious issues with forming any emotional attachment with the main characters. It might be because of the brisk pace, >!or how he spends most of the second half alone,!< but MacKay as Schofield seemed to be emotionally outside the whole process. Richard Madden put more believable emotion into his glorified cameo than MacKay did in the second half of the movie. I would have said that a different actor would be able to pull it off better, but Spielberg was able to pull it off using a literal horse, so I'm not sure where the issue lies.

In terms of comparable WW1 films, I'd still put it in the top five. Well below War Horse or Paths of Glory, above Parade's End, and tied with the first episode of Our War from the BBC.",emi5z3

I hope it wins academy award for director tho but for movie ?                                                
                                                                                                        
Might be just me but how can you make WW1 movie and left viewer with almost no emotions ? I never cared for anyone in this movie despite the fact that half of the movie was about building the ""chemistry"" between the characters. Take for instance Blake's death, yes i was like ""oh damn, that just happend"" but he was dying so damn long that it completely ruined it for me. If he would just died almost right away after the initial shock of getting stabbed without saying anything it would have had more of impact to me as it would come out of the blue and would actually fit the movie more. Well instead, i mean, he was dying 6 minutes of footage. Thats ridiculous and kinda cliché that i didnt expect in this type of movie, especially how it was set. Also German soldiers are apparently Stormtroopers.
7/10",emi5z3
fgvb48e,"Even though this is supposed to win best picture on Sunday, there are at least 4 other movies that I believe are more deserving.  It's a technical masterpiece, but there was no emotional connection to anyone in the film caused by a real lack of character development.  It kind of reminded me of a suspense movie like Bird Box or the Quiet Place with War instead of super natural enemies.  It won't stick around in my head the way Parasite or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood did.  I would have liked just 5 or 10 mins of exposition where we learned who the characters were and began to relate to them before the frenetic continuous shot started.  7/10.

I loved it.  It's probably the best war movie I've seen.  It's a travesty that it's not in most IMAXs this week, but I'll be revisiting it a couple weeks from now when it makes its way there.  See it on the biggest screen possible.",emi5z3

Technically, the movie's a bonafide masterpiece (especially the sound and cinematography).

However, it felt like the movie was missing something, and I can't really put my finger on it. Part of me thinks it's because, in my opinion at least, the movie didn't really have a soul. The closeness to the characters was only because of the way it was filmed; I wasn't especially connected to the characters (to 1917's credit, there were a couple of great moments of character development, particularly with the cherry tree scene).

The thing this does so well is focus in and drill down into a momentary event and make it seem all encompassing. I was so invested in the story, the outcome, the characters.

There are several moments where there are cuts to different takes: when he passes out, diving in the water, the tripwired explosion, and probably one or two I'm forgetting, but it flowed extremely well and seamlessly. By the end of it you see how exhausted Schofield is. He's had a *really* long day. They also callback to when we first see him, leaning against a tree.  
  
That action sequence where Schofield is on his way to find MacKenzie was awesome. All the action sequences were very well done, the plane crash and choking fight in the town. The movie felt pretty linear and straightforward, but this is one where you notice new things on rewatches. I can see this getting a Best Picture nom, but not winning, at the Oscars.",emi5z3

The score was also very good. The fact that this film is all done in one “long take,” makes it even more impressive. However, I feel like there isn’t much else going for the film, aside from its technical aspects. The script is pretty basic, and very reminiscent of other war films, like Saving Private Ryan, or Dunkirk. And none of the performances really stood out to me. Not to say that the acting was bad–the lead actor definitely did a good job–but I just didn’t think any of the acting was truly incredible. I don’t know if the film would really hold up, or at least be getting all the praise it’s gotten, if not for the one shot gimmick.

frmn8o4,"Waited forever to see this since Hollywood doesn't make good movies anymore, is scared to show any real grittiness, and always fucks up modern War movies. If you wanted something on the level of Saving Private Ryan seek elsewhere.    

1917 relies the stupidity of characters and movie magic to move the story forward.  Since this film was so unrealistic and relied so much on conveniences, I never had a feeling of suspense until the very end. It completely brought me out of the film to the point I was just waiting for the next scene and what other stupidity will occur.    

More annoying stuff:  
1. Trained German soldier has a open shot standing literally in front of hip. Instead of aiming and shooting he decides to start sprinting and fire from the hip??? (btw both sides had ""calls"" to yell out to identify enemy vs friendly)  
2. All the germans in the town can't stop and aim, only knowing how to hip fire while running
3. Sniper misses completely open easy shot of guy balancing on bridge, then misses the shot when he has him pinned down in the exact same spot he kept popping out of. 
4. They clearly spent more money on cinematography than writing or action choreography  
5.  A war movie, especially about ww1, with hardly and violence or gore? LOL  

Sorry but I don't see anything oscar worthy about this film. Even the one-take cinematography is filled with boring, slow shots that just draw out scenes because the camera needs time to rotate. 

I'm tired of action movies filled with pointless cinematography porn but having very little realistic action or thrilling suspense. Skyfall, MI:Fallout, the new Bourne all had this problem. Pretty shots with boring action while relying on character stupidity for plot conveniences. Action movies are dead.  

Face it. They don't make gritty violent realistic war movies anymore. The good intense action movies we had in the 00s are gone. War movies like this, Fury, and Dunkirk make it seem like Disney switched to making grossly unrealistic and melodramatic historical war dramas. And their audiences have extremely low standards, give them pretty camera work and actors theyll like and they'll throw all their money at it.  

I really wonder what kind of movies audiences grew up on that call stuff like this. Dunkirk, Fury, Fallout, Skyfall etc when they are mere melodramas at best with extra-safe clean action scenes. Action movies are dead and the people who jack off to technicalities that add nothing interesting or exciting to the film. You guys are the reason Hollywood can keep lowering the quality of films they put out.  

1/5 i would have been upset if i actually paid to see this at the show",emi5z3

The main characters only really interact up close with two of them, and one of them stabs a man for seemingly no reason as he tries to tend to his wounds.

feiwwc5,"Just watched it. Not perfect but pretty damn good. Cinematography is maybe the best I’ve ever seen. Some plot holes here and there. For a movie that prides itself on being so accurate, it bugged me (more than it probably should) that the bullet physics were wrong in some of the scenes. When Schofield is crossing the broken bridge, and starts to get shot at, the bullets hit after we hear the sound of the gun, making no sense as bullets travel faster then sound. Small gripe but it kind of took me out of the movie for a little.     

8/10",emi5z3
ffdondj,"Anyone else think Blake's death was weird? Visually he looked realistically pale but he'd go from sounding weak, to sounding strong and aware, to sounding strong and confused, to suddenly going unconscious. He didn't sound weak enough, and his deterioration was too fast.

Also, Schofield went from blacking out and being saved from certain death in the bunker explosion to being perfectly healthy within 3 minutes. Then later on that day he blacked out again after being shot, but woke up completely healthy and could run across a whole trench.

Also I feel like the “one take” distracted from the story and limited what they could have done. Because it was made to look like one take, I felt that I could never get fully invested in the story, as it was a visual reminder that I was always watching a movie. 

When in the trailers I saw one guy running around doing all this stuff, and the movie opened up with two guys, it was very clear that one of them was not gonna make it. And once one died, I never felt that he was going to fail his mission. To me, it just wasn’t tense after the plane crash. Which is a shame, cause that scene when he needs to hop over the wall was exciting, but it just wasn’t tense to me. 

I’m glad I saw it and I would recommend it, just for the sake of the filmmaking aspects, as what they did was extremely impressive, but other than the “one take” look, the movie isn’t amazing.",emi5z3

ff4jgi0,"I liked this movie. Best way to describe it in one word was ""intense"". If you are looking for an intense movie than this is for you. However there are a few scenes that hurt the movie a bit. They are a bit hard to over look. 

The scene in the German trenches. The entire ceiling falls on him and he is pretty much okay. Why do that? This scene if fixed by it blowing them both back, him getting some shit in his eyes and them getting over that obstacle. They show WAY to much debris on him when the entire roof came down. 

Scene at the farm. They make it a point literally 10 minutes later to show that the Germans gunned down every cow. So how is there one still standing with a bucket of milk. I am not expert on this but I dont think that is how milk works. This scene was odd but turned silly as fuck when we see the baby. The baby was a complete waste of time and added nothing to the movie. It didnt even make sense. And again I dont think that is how milk works. This plays out like a side quest in an RPG. Good thing you still have the milk because now you get a bunch of XP. It didnt make sense that she had a fire going right outside of a German occupied town. How long has she been there with this super quiet baby? And the worst part is how unnecessary it is to the film.  

Benedict Cummberbachs scene was so anti climactic. He reads the letter and calls off the attack. Why wasnt he at least a little begrudging about it? We are warned about him and nothing. It seemed so odd.",emi5z3
fdu09qq,"Minor movie error- When Schofield is running parallel to the trenches near the end of the movie, the first person he knocks over continues to lay limp on the ground as if he were dead. (not sure if this was intentional)

fdte61s,"One issue I have with the movie being ""one"" take is that we watch the film in real time. We are told the journey should take 6-8ish hours yet the film runtime is only about 2. It always seemed like they would turn from one spot and suddenly be in another place. I think the better thing to do would have been to insert more time jumps. Yes the film wouldn't have been two takes but would it really have suffered if they had added say two more? I think they let the film style take precedence over logic. It took me out of the film.

Where I'd add the time jumps:
>!1. After exiting the area of the artillery 2. When he gets into the truck!<

I also felt that after Dunkirk this movie failed with the authentic sounds of warfare.

I also would have liked to see a little more action. >!maybe had him shoot back at the germans chasing him and not running away. How did he not get shot? That too was a little much for me!<",emi5z3

Something like Children of Men reminds me of Half Life 2 etc.   
Back to 1917 great movie, great shots, great acting. Really appreciate everything of it. I was wondering why Schofield didn't shoot the soldier approaching him. Was he out of bullets? Wasn't sure if was enemy? Didn't want to cause more attention?

Too much action or things happening towards the end, to the point that it almost becomes a series of convenient conveniences even though the movie was based on a rapidly developing No Man's Land so this should be more believable. Almost. It would be worse were the movie not lying about being one continuous shot (it is two).

My only real complaint is that Blake’s death loses all effectiveness and impact when you find out that there was a huge line of trucks and soldiers pissing just on the other side of the farmhouse. It felt like a very jarring segue. It went from this sadness and loss to this awkward introduction. Maybe it would have been better if they’d come across Schofield later?

Edit:

This is my personal opinion but I thought it was a let down after such high reviews and awards. 

Spoilers ahead 



I felt that it was not necessary to make a movie for 2 hours about a soldier delivering a letter to someone. Also there are several plot holes (and if anyone knows the answer to these please let me know) :

Why couldn’t they just take a plane or drive a tank instead of going on foot? 

They also could’ve done better job explaining the impact of how stopping the attack would save lives/more depth on how the Germans planned to respond to the attack.

Would’ve liked to see more events from early in the movie be connected to the end, like the German woman he met in a bunker with the baby..or the people he met with on the tank where they had to push it out of the mud. None of these characters are seen later making me feel not a lot of connection to the events.

Didn’t care for the ending. It just seemed so abrupt like there should’ve been more to close the movie. 

All in all I was rarely on the edge of my seat. The beginning was good but I thought the movie would’ve changed direction. Nope, just the same thing of getting to the captain to deliver the letter.

I would like someone to justify why they thought this movie was good, as it did get super good reviews and many people seemed to like it.",emi5z3
feqd6e2,"6/10...

Sorry guys, unpopular opinion, but this one didn't work for me.I usually like war movies so when I saw the trailer, I was convinced I'm watching it, no further details needed. So I went in without knowing any bits about the filming technique. After about 10 mins in, I started to notice.... Is this whole thing one take?? TBH, it actually became a bit distracting cause then I started to watch for cuts because I knew the movie cannot really be shot in one ""2 hour"" take. Anyhow, I know what they were trying to do... make it like one long seamless epic, but to me, it started to feel too drawn out at various times. In some cases, it felt like a camera just following the entire movie (which it literally was) and it actually took me ""out"" of the movie. It's a clever gimmick, but it felt more like an experimental film.

I couldn't relate to the characters. Of course not from a military stand point, I never been in a war before. But Corporal Blake kind of annoyed me because of how carefree he seemed to be in the beginning, relative to his friend, Schofield. Just felt his eagerness was over the top and he was going to get them killed. Schofield was definitely the more cautious counterpart on that team. Anyhow, it was rather sad how Blake got stabbed and died. I had no idea he was going to die and only last like 1/3 of the film. But like I said earlier, I didn't really enjoy his character, so I wasn't getting too hung over it in all honesty. I thought it was rather stupid to try to save your enemy in the middle of the war anyhow. Just my brutal opinion. It's a war... But yeah, more reasons why I wouldn't be able to relate with the characters.

More on that, the major plot armor given to Schofield for the rest of the movie. I don't know how many of these events are actual historical fact so not sure if/what was forced to happen to stay true to non-fiction, but things like Schofield losing his helmet which literally saved his life, and not making it a priority to find it again. Then ditching his rifle, which I don't think anyone would debate, at that point, is one of the most vital things he needs. Then all the running in the French city with soldiers trying to shoot him didn't look realistic at all considering a few of them were VERY close, but none of them could aim. For a bit, it was also done in an overly artistic way that almost mislead me into thinking it was a dream sequence. The very first encounter (before he even met that woman and the baby), a German soldier was literally running toward him and Schofield didn't even notice. And still, somehow the soldier missed. lol, what? I would have rather they just omitted something like that from the film than to just have blind soldiers missing from ""point blank"", blatantly showcasing plot armor. Apparently these soldiers have ""Stormtrooper"" aim. The ""sniper"" continually missing him while he was crossing the bridge was mildly believable, but the running part... was just too comical in a movie with a serious tone.

Overall, the story was fairly shallow and not much content in the plot line. It was straight to the point and I guess that was ok for many people. But I couldn't relate to the characters and that killed it for me. I wasn't able to put myself in the character's shoes. It wasn't a deep plot with great dialogue like Saving Private Ryan. It wasn't ""edge of my seat"" suspenseful like... I don't know.. Tom Cruise's Valkyrie?

Another movie which had a lot of high ratings was Dunkirk, which I was fairly disappointed in and thought the ""suspense"" was lackluster. But I somewhat relate these two movies in a sense that I believe if one likes Dunkirk, they would probably enjoy this too.",emi5z3

1. >!The journey was meant to take ~7-8 hours right? Yet the film is only 2 hours... if there are no action breaks, then how did he ever make it in time? Imo if they wanted to make a fully ""continuous"" film they should have written it differently. I actually think too much happened during the film which made it feel unrealistic. !<

2. >!Everything had to have happened super close together geographically. It makes sense, given the way WWI was fought, but it felt a little too close to me... like the convoy drives away and he's instantly being shot at from the tower. Could they not have heard he was in trouble, or sent someone with him to help? !<

3. >!Multiple times the main character is being chased by a person with a gun, and instead of hiding, fighting, or anything else, he runs in a straight line. Thankfully they always shot at him from the hip instead of lining up for an easy shot... !<

4. >!To me, it seemed very anticlimactic. The ending was cringe-worthy and leaned too heavily on the fame of the two leader-type characters at the end. !<

femof31,"Great movie. I have a couple of nitpicks though that I haven't seen mentioned.

* The ""Why did you choose me"" scene. I thought this a pretty weird thing to say. Felt like such a forced cliche. He was the only person within close proximity and they appear to be good friends. Why wouldn't he choose him?
* I didn't quite sense the urgency of the situation until we got to the climax. I understand that he was exhausted after he emerges from the river. However, he should have asked for help as soon as he was in listening range of the soldiers in the forest. There were 1600 lives at stake and he knew the attack was planned for that morning. There was no time to waste.

Perhaps my second point explains my first. He wasn't perfect.

For example, the whole plot of the movie is based on them not having communications because the lines are cut. There were no pigeons around to carry a message? Pretty common in the war. 

The scene in the bombed out town also annoyed me. There seemed to be a lot of Germans in the town, did they not notice the British convoy passing right by them? When he was getting shot at when trying to cross the collapsed bridge, the bullets seemed to be coming from his right judging from how they were hitting the bridge. The sniper ended up being on his left.

If he didn’t get shot, why did he fall down the stairs when he confronted the German in the room? 

Why do the Germans he encounters when he wakes up suck at shooting him point blank? How did the German chasing him not see him go into the basement of the house?

fdtrx1d,"I love war films and I was very interested in seeing a WW1 film for once. I like the realism and it had a decent story but I think film was slightly above average at best. 

  The thing my favorite  war film isn’t even a film but the Band ofBrotherz. It was just realistic not just in action but how characters were with other aspects of war. Same thing with films like SPR or even Dunkirk they balanced the action and emotional side of war. 

 I just feel this film was falsely advertised as a war film and was more adventure.  It had very realistic viewpoints of WW1. I like the scenes in the trenches and I liked that scene in that bomber French town at night. But there was just no action. Listen I love movies and I’m not just a Marvel nerd which I also hate. I’m just not a guy that will say every film that critics love is the GOAT. I just feel like a film has to always connect to everyone and for me it just didn’t get to the war side of me. War sucks but for me when I’m watching a war film I don’t want action but realistic war scenes. I just didn’t see any of that in this film.

 This film isn’t bad but. I just feel as a war film you got to add some elements of action. For me the film should’ve not totally advertised this film as a war film cause I just didn’t see any meaningful action. I wish there could be a film that looked into the trenches and some charges.  Even with Dunkirk, yes it wasn’t too bloody and wasn’t all action, but for me it did better showing the tension of war and highlighted a military event.

2.)After he leaves the trench's to run the 300 yards to go warn Colonel Mackenzie... the explosion/smoke on the battlefield was terribly done cgi. it diapered almost too fast and looked very fake.

fe3z6qx,"Good film. Great visuals. But as a WW1 film failed to capture the horror and themes of historiography or veteran accounts as per Journeys End which is a superb movie. Of course it had brilliant source material from someone who served. The reason why they were doing it seemed a bit thin, an elaborate German retreat to  trap 1,600 men was a bit low scale. 

In addition, why did he come to the trenches to give the message to a runner. Why not pick a runner to go behind the lines along transport links, they have trucks and horses, and whilst they talk about cut wires surely it would be quicker to get to a point where communication could be made or go up through the rear of the allied lines to where Benny and crew are located. I mean the lines were generally clear, as per Mark Strong strolling around, but they keep mentioning sharp shooters and little pockets of resistance (not to mention retreating armies loved boobytraps in the war) it just doesnt warrant the risk. Or maybe the general really did think 1600 men wasnt great stakes and was like ill chance this one with special teams.

 Given with how little caution these two displayed the only way they could survive is if they found Benny Hills relatives in German uniforms.

fg4ap58,"The movie looked amazing but the timeline had me so confused, along with other parts. 

One moment William is riding with other soldiers trying to get closer to his destination and then he has to leave because of time constraints. He walks 20 feet to another small bridge and gets shot at but no one from the caravan is near him to help? So either the huge slow ass caravan drove off within 15 seconds of William being shot at or they just blindly left them out. 

What happened to William when he shot the sniper? Why did he fall back and hit his head? I thought he got shot. I’m assuming he got startled and jumped back but the dude fell
over like he was jumped by a bear. 

What the hell was that scene with the German girl? Somehow they managed to have a conversation without William even speaking the language. He obviously knew simple words and expressions from living in Europe and fighting but how did the woman understand him. They literally didn’t skip a beat even though they did not speak the same language. Also, why did he waste so much time in there with the baby and girl anyways? Thought he was on a tight schedule. 

Another thing. William jumps into the river when there is barely even a glimmer of light in the sky. Like it was practically pitch black out. When he gets out of the river it is broad daylight. So either the sun rose way quicker in 1917 or something isn’t adding up with the timing here. 

Ahhh another part about the river. Soooo was that river warm or something? I’m pretty sure William would be suffering from hypothermia from being in a river for a large chunk of time. But nope. William crawls out of the river and walks around in his wet ass clothes like nothing happened.

fdtom0a,"1917 is proof that cinematography can be ""too nice"". Not a blemish in a film that should be as dirty as any other. It felt too clean, too neat and perfect. The mud was corrected to a kind of tan color instead of dark brown that I couldn't shake for a war I'm led to believe was conducted entirely in it.

That being said, this film has some of the best production design of all time. The first ""no man's land"": the craters, dead horses and barbed wire... it all flowed together beautifully. Incredible; serenely organic.",emi5z3
fdw60hv," I consider the German pilot stabbing scene to have almost ruined what was an amazing movie. I find it hard to believe the German pilot who was severely burned and just rescued’s first instinct would be to stab an enemy soldier. I know there were war crimes on both sides but come on. 

Otherwise the burning town scene and the no mans land scenes were incredible.",emi5z3
fevydf2,"The movie was good, a solid 8, but I was expecting more since everyone was saying that it was a masterpiece and the movie of the decade.

The script was lazy, the acting was ok, the British cameos funny, the outstanding was the photography and music, the plot was like going from Point A to B with some final bosses.

Hacksaw Ridge was miles better tbh, and Dunkirk while too much water/blue, had a clever plot.",emi5z3
fejnodq,"Damn, that was disappointing. Easily one of the most mediocre war movies in a while. Characters spoke like the screenwriters don't understand how people talk. And coming off films like Uncut Gems, you can really notice the difference between a good screenplay and not. The story was bare bones and boring. The journey itself was cliche and eye rolling. Especially during that random dreamy scene with the woman and child, or the flares constantly going off for seemingly no reason. I get that it creates a dreamlike experience, but when it takes away the reality and doesn't confirm those events were indeed him hallucinating, then it doesn't work. 

I couldn't help but think the film would've been so much better if they just...didn't do an entire one shot. It genuinely didn't help the film. There were certainly scenes that deserved one shots, but not the entire film. Only seeing the back of their heads while they were walking and talking was just awkward. You could tell they needed to switch things up by not just having them walk at it the entire time, but I mean wtf did you expect when you're making a movie about being in trenches for a third of the runtime? 

The one shot felt like a gimmick instead of something genuine, like Birdman. Easily the weakest Roger Deakins film in a while, which sucks. This movie was fuckin boring.",emi5z3
fdpwqbd,"A lot less action than I was expecting, was it just the one gunfight at the bridge? I mean I know it’s not gonna be mission impossible but you’d think there would be more fighting in a war movie. And several times enemies had clear shots on schofield and missed or just chased him instead? Not to say I didn’t like it, obviously a lot to like here too and especially at the beginning there was almost more tension from there not being a fight. Saving private Ryan still king imo",emi5z3

fejt86l,"Really shouldn't have done the one take gimmick. Using one style of shot makes the whole movie become stagnant. It slows everything down because either the camera has to catch up or the actors have to slow down. Sometimes on take works, like when they're underground but other times like when he's running through the trenches to meet the cumberpatch it takes to long. A few close ups with shaky cam could have shown his panic and desperation far better than one long boring medium shot.

Thematically the one shot makes sense, as its one long journey for one man that has no breaks. But as a viewer it didn't work. And the characters were left out in the cold in favour of more technical elements. like when someone at the end said ""whats your name"" I had no idea what the main guys name was. A strong movie makes you know the characters not through repetition but strong elements that you attach to the name.",emi5z3

fe107um,"This movie would have been so much better without the one-take gimmick crap.  All the stuff that felt phony was because of it.  The bit with the cut hand into the dead body was as plainly choreographed as a Buster Keaton gag, for example.

fdpn7um,"forgive the lack of caps

saw this around xmas. imo i was very disappointed. the movie is terrific for about the first half to 2/3. then the gimmick starts to hurt the film. the writing is just bad in the second half. the main star absolutely carries this film though. because the film is asking us to treat it seriously i cannot overlook many of its barbaric writing mistakes and convenient plot elements to make the gimmick work. this made me laugh and took me out of it a lot. when the kid is in the river we cant tell what the passage of time is even though its the whole fucking point. then he just sits through an entire song and its way past dawn. hello?! when he gets shot and sleeps through the whole night... then his neck is hurt. but holy shit did they forget he got shot? oh im sure he missed that point blank shot and that is why he flew backwards. the attack begins at dawn but holy shit i just woke up and its nearly dawn. so lets jump into the river and lets get to the trenches in 5 minutes. this film angered me so much. the cinematography is excellent and the other kid shouldn't have died so early they had great chemistry. but holy shit the writing was frustrating. if it were star wars i wouldnt care about convenient plot armor. when its a so called oscar contender it cant do that.

the opening shot is incredible. the no mans land and tunnels was the best part. the suspense it builds and the dread and threat of danger at the start is superb but the film loses this at some point and that is when it fails.",emi5z3

I felt the same about the scene in the basement with the French woman, and also him letting go of the Nazi youth. Just didn't add up with what he had been through and his behaviour previously. 

Overall amazing movie I will watch many times but I can't help but feel it suffers from a weak soundtrack and the above mentioned behaviour changes.

Edited to say: I watched it in a Dolby theater and the blury screen when the camera panned was really upsetting and nearly made me sick sometimes. Hoping a regular watch of it won't do that.",emi5z3

fdprwtk,I absolutely love that guy and wished he would get bigger roles. He has such a presence and is a phenomenal actor.,emi5z3
fdtkiwb,There were several cool shots like that. When he shoots the flair and instead of following it the camera remains focused on the characters staring at it and then it comes back into frame as it falls behind them a few seconds later. Hearing the planes and only seeing them after they had passed because yet again the camera was focused on the characters. Right at the beginning in the trenches when Schofield falls behind because he runs into a soldier and then helps him pick up his things and then a minute later Blake gets too far ahead and we catch up to him mid-argument with someone. I can't think of many movies where characters interact with things out of frame/focus like that. So many movies it feels like everything else in the world is on pause while what you're watching is happening. It really helped sell the immersion because it felt like the real world where things kept happening even though we couldn't see them.,emi5z3

I don't know if I could follow my own advice if it came down to me really having to kill real humans. I know I'm ""armchair-soldier-ing"" but damn I wanted him to just bayonet that guy from the get-go! It's war! You can kill the other team damnit! You saw how being merciful worked out for Blake! It was especially frustrating when that German soldier is walking past the burning church and hasn't seen Schofield yet, but Schofield just hesitates.

fdqigya,"That scene is where I couldn’t hold back the tears. I suppose that you could call it a sad moment, because Schofield knows they are running into a rigged/losing battle, but it was just a combination of everything leading up to that point and Schofield’s willingness to finish the mission that just made me weep.

Pilot gets rescued, pilot then STABS rescuer, knowing other rescuer is nearby with loaded SMLE, then pilot faces off with new rescuer?

This is in 1917, Nazis don’t exist yet, the Germans are starving, and they’re not all bloodthirsty savages.  They were humans who died as well.

fdrh8tw,"When they left his body at the farmhouse it was a beautiful sad moment of ""just another body on the landscape.""  But we knew part of his story.

So poignant.",emi5z3
fdrh9n5,Absolutely. Also when Schofield snagged his hand on barbed wire early in the film and then subsequently plunges it by accident into some unfortunate person's rotting waterlogged corpse AUGGGHHHHHH,emi5z3
fdrxqzh,"It was so realistic though, the men caught in barbed wire, the rats eating the corpses, the flies on dead horses. 

The stories of men hiding in craters or ditches, injured and waiting for nightfall are devastating. Similarly, the story on Dan Carlin’s hardcore history of a soldier sunk up to his waist in mud that other soldiers had to leave as conditions were so treacherous. The following day they returned and only his head was left above the mud, losing his mind. Horrendous.",emi5z3
fdqgmzp,When he was stuck swimming through the bloated dead bodies in the dam i was like “fuck that’s gross” but also “fuck that makes sense they’d all float down the river and be stuck there”. I’m sure there’s a combo of people who were killed in the river and just thrown in the river after being killed to move out of the way.,emi5z3

fdzspnn,"After watching the movie I read more about world war 1. Up until that time charging land assaults where the best way to take an enemies position. However with improvements to artillery and machine guns the frontal charge became extremely ineffective. Something that would cost hundreds of thousands of lives for the commanders to figure out.

The initial assaults in world war 1 where massacres. They where so bad the French army mutinied against their commanders for continuously sending them into suicidal assaults.

Each side entered stalemates as neither side could advanced without heavy losses, and as shown in the movie the Germans generally had much better defences, despite being outnumbered.

These issues where partially rectified with the allies invention of the tank, and the Germans specially trained stormtroopers who became experts at raiding enemy trenches via suprise attack.",emi5z3
feisfgz,It was worse in reality.  The ground was so churned up by constant artillery that it was mud so thick men would be sucked down and drown in it.  The craters were death traps that you couldn't climb out of due to the mud with a water mixed with decomposing body parts and poison gas.  They said you could smell the front lines for miles before you could even see it.,emi5z3

fe5tm6t,"Odd, Me and the people i saw it with saw it as a turning point when the movie lost all its momentum and turned into a mediocre at best movie.",emi5z3
fe6so3j,And good God that soundtrack... Made the scene infinitely better. You can tell that Schofield feels he has a new lease on life but knows that he's still in a dangerous situation. There's so much nuance in that one scene it's incredible. The blend of music and cinematography is something I haven't been so in awe of since watching Interstellar in theatres. If Thomas Newman doesn't win an Oscar for the soundtrack then I'll never trust the guys who vote for the winner ever again.,emi5z3

Sort of a journey into hell and back again.",emi5z3
fez6nlu,When the figure appeared next to the fully engulfed building and you have no clue if it's a German or not until he fired his rifle. Terrifying.,emi5z3

fep04de,"That whole scene, starting with them finding Schofield and Blake, till he leaves them, felt very important to me. Emotional core of the movie where camaraderie/ showing an average soldiers mindset is concerned.

We had the detached general (?), almost aristocracy, in his car, giving orders from afar, barking bordering on useless orders to solve the problem, the professionally distant, but engaged with the ground troups as well as the general, captain (?), and we have the cynical/ jovial grunts that are just along for the shitty ride doing all the actual physical work/ sacrifice and trying to make the best of it, and finally Schofield, leading the squad, being inbetween the latter two, actually moving things along.

It's a microcosm of the whole war-time hierarchy in one neat little 10 minute scene. It's fucking brilliant is what I'm saying.

Like, I really liked that Schofield *still* didn't turn into an ass there. He was all clear orders and just: ""Come one! Push! Everyone! No time for wood!"" And despite not knowing him, they saw his urgency, they saw their captain placing him with them and so they did.

Felt like they were all just glad for another break/ delay, but when they saw his need they helped with no more questions asked.

~~Also that guy with the whiskey. Didn't quite know why this new guy was so tense/ intense, but he understood that he probably had a reason and tried to help him with the only thing he could do in that moment.~~ Edit: Just watched a 2nd time.

In a way, 1917 is a grander narrative than Saving Private Ryan, as tens of thousands of people are saved rather than just all these soldiers dying to save one person.  Even the imagery of 1917 might be grander, as others in this thread have already pointed out the Christ imagery.

WW2 was far more complex than WW1. WW1 was imperial politicking by major empires or kingdoms wanting to get bigger or trying to survive which led to the destruction of three major empires bring the world closer to what we know it. WW2 was a colossal mess of ideology, nationalism, imperialism, old ethnic hatreds, WW1 hubris, expansionism and desire to get back lost land (the USSR and Germany), capture historical lands, new states formed by WW1 like Estonia or Lithuania or recreated after WW1, like Poland, all of which were already infighting for territory after WW1.

Edit: I got 6-8 because Schofield says 6-8 hours. It’s actually 9 miles.",emi5z3
fe68tg3,"I mean there's a lot of movie logic involved, which is totally fair. As in, it's shown as one shot, but if you actually paced out the distances he traveled, it would be *way* too short (it wouldn't make any sense for all these places to be so close to one another).

Which, again, is perfectly fine. Movies have their own logic, what matters is the experience. You just have to imagine that those scenes where he's walking somewhere for 5 minutes, he's traveling a lot more than 1/4 of a mile, and it's condensed for our experience (everything in a movie is a representation, to some extent). 

Like, in the river scene, it wouldn't make sense for him to go like, 3 minutes down the river out of town, and suddenly find all these soldiers. The army was right next to the town? But that's just how the movie is structured, the camera technique shouldn't be used as a literal measure of distance.",emi5z3
feppvah,"For me the fact that we’re led to believe we’ve seen every second of his journey actually cheapened the accomplishment of Schofield by making it seem as though he did not travel as far as he supposedly did. I left the movie confused about whether I was supposed to believe I had seen his entire journey in real time. I think Mendes decision to film this in “one shot” was based on the praise he’d receive for the technical accomplishment and not because it served the story. This was distracting for me and my wife to the point where it was the most discussed aspect of the movie afterward, which is a real shame because it’s a good movie otherwise.

I don't think I can ever take a critic seriously with that line of thinking.  There was nothing in this movie that made war look like anything less than absolute hell.  I mean, that was literally one of the only thoughts I kept returning to  during the quieter scenes of Tom and William just walking through the trenches and no man's land, just how awful it must have been for these boys.

ffcous3,">	EDIT: as an aside, I’ve seen multiple critics rating this poorly by saying its “irresponsible” to turn war into a spectacle.

Omg what. How can *that* be anyone’s takeaway from this movie. On the contrary, I thought this was the first war movie in a long time that doesn’t glorify war at all, not even the good guys fighting the good fight (which Dunkirk kind of did, in a few scenes).

To me, the movje doesn’t particularly aim at delivering a powerful message about how war is hell, it just... sort or comes naturally, resulting more from the combined effect of everything than from a declaration of intent, as it were.",emi5z3
fg9pcb9,"I may get downvoted but I'm just saying this for the sake of discussion. I don't think you're wrong and I'm right this is just a matter of taste... but I kind of agree with the whole spectacle criticism thing. Not that it's irresponsible it just took me out of the world - it felt like a war themed theme park ride to me and not like I was in a war.

A lot of what contributed to that I think was character motivations didn't make sense to me. They seems to be there just so they could execute a setpiece. e.g. Taking the time to sing to a baby when you're meant to be in a hurry.",emi5z3

Second, and more important, pilots in the first wolrd war were all officers who saw this more as a sport (like hunting). Most of them were sons of noble families. The officer would have expected to be imprisoned for a short time and then returned to Germany. It made zero sense for him to stab a low ranking British soldier who was saving him.",emi5z3
fem43qm,"I really enjoyed this movie but that character did feel a bit like the ""evil super nazi bad guy"" trope. He just went through several traumatic experiences (dogfight, plane crash, burning) in a short time but still had it in him to shank someone helping him? I get that the pilot character only served one purpose and wasn't going to get any development but maybe that scene would have benefited from him appearing bewildered or frightened, I could see someone mustering the strength to react that way if they thought they were still in a life or death situation. 

Should mention I know there weren't nazis in WWI, but a lot of people are ignorant of that and apply that Germany=nazi=evil thinking to WWI as well.",emi5z3

Then one of them falls in with the bullshitters and they have absolutely no idea what you just went through and there's no way you could ever get them to know in a brief conversation.

fdpeagp,"As soon as I left the theater I wanted to go back in and see it again and really soak it all in.  Half the time I was marveling in my head at the production and set designs and how insane the whole shoot must've been.  The other half I spent thinking just how awful and hellish WWI really was for these men and being concerned for William's hand.  So much death and disease...  
  
The story was beautiful in it's simplicity and was carried by the performances and cinematography.  The decision to shoot the whole thing as a one-take was something I initially was a little worried might come across as a little gimmicky but it was excellently done.  It felt right in the action when it needed to but Mendes and Deakins also knew when to back off it a bit to let the story breathe and take shape.    It really put you in the trenches with William and Tom and allowed you as the viewer to get a full understanding of how horrible and gruesome it must've been for those young men.    
  
I have to say that Tom's death scene really got to me too.  I was so focused on what was happening that it caught me by surprise.   I had seen the trailers so I had an idea that Tom wasn't going to make it but in the moment I just didn't see it coming.  The next ten minutes had me almost in tears.  Watching William struggle to get him moving, Tom slowly figure out he was dying and the two of them sitting there was just brutal.  It was definitely up there with Mellish and Wade's deaths in Saving Private Ryan in terms of how difficult it was for me to watch.  
  
Overall, I think for me, 1917 is to WWI what Saving Private Ryan is to WWII and it is absolutely one of my favorite films of the year and one of the best war films I've seen.",emi5z3
fdpd4jw,"If this film doesn’t sweep at LEAST the technical awards I will riot. Best fucking movie of 2019 and one of the best war films I’ve ever seen, I don’t even care about people coming at me with “recency bias” arguments. This was spectacular.",emi5z3
fdqn0gv,"I saw it yesterday in Dolby for the third time, since the movie has been out here in regular theaters for 2 weeks. It really is a movie you want to come back to, but after a few times it's also very interesting to take in the audience reactions. The barbed wire injury and especially the ""hand in man hole"" scene get audible groans and gasps every single time. The funny bits also work reliably with the audience. 

And then we get to the two standout scenes, the flares in the village and then the final end run. Everyone is bringing their A game. Roger Deakins obviously, I also think the flare sequence alone is screaming ""Oscar!"". But Thomas Newman's score for both scenes is fantastic. Of course there will be people who don't like scenes where the score takes control and prefer more subtle approaches, but my god the first time I saw the flares scene I was sitting there in awe with my mouth open. I can't remember having a reaction like this since the hallway gravity bonanza scene in Inception. 

And while the end run is at day, has an equally exceptional score and brings in more spectacle with explosions and sheer scale, it's now time to talk about the actors and specificially George Mackay. He really got me. I haven't seen a portrayal of pure pain and desperation like this from such a young actor in a long time. When he is in the trench at the end and is being told his goal is 300 yards away but he can't reach it now, his face tells an entire story within a few seconds. And rewinding, the desperation when he crawls out of the river, the scene between him and Blake after the plane crash, desperately asking for help to push the truck out of the mud and my favorite, when he talks to Blake about why he doesn't like to go home: ""I hated going home. I hated it. When I knew I couldn't stay, when I knew I had to leave and they might never see..."" That hit me hard. Dunno why it suddenly rained in the theater.

The supporting actors were great too, no matter how small the role, everyone was memorable. Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden and many more.

I don’t know much about the history of WWI, but to consider how much trauma, emotional and physical, single individuals went through (and go through, for current soldiers) without the expectation of honor and praise... it’s just fascinating, and sad, and awe-inspiring.

fmr1zob,"This is an awesome interpretation. ""Duty to the person next to you."" Damn. 

Maybe this is just me but, as someone who was looking for fun themes and symbols to analyze in the film, early on Schofield explains his lost medal and that Blake had earned one in saving him and should be happy about it. Schofield calls it just a piece of bloody tin in reference to his own though and, while I know it wasn't meant this way, I feel like that plays into your interpretation here. The medals from their country for this war are worthless. Pieces of bloody tin. And I know bloody is just british swearing but, Bloodied Tin even, maybe, for those earned in particularly gruesome ways? But he seemed happy about the way Blake would have earned his there-- by saving a comrade.

I sort of enjoyed reading into that idea more too with the rings pulled from Blake's fingers and given to his brother. More pieces of bloody tin. Blake said you should take the medals and send it home for your family... Maybe the rings were the bloody tin for his.",emi5z3
fokr8dk,"I agree, he didn't even want to go in the first place and clearly isn't concerned about medals or glory. I think after Blake died it was more about making sure his friend didn't die in vain, and carrying on his wish to save his brother, in that way he succeeded.",emi5z3
fnyk22a,"Totally agree and thats why I loved the movie. It's about keeping your word ( to country and fellow human), bravery, honor etc",emi5z3
fdpg6f0,"> Here, though, it works so well. It's like you're taking a tour of another time, walking through horrors we haven't even seen in photographs.

100% agree.  I think the one-take can sometimes feel like it's less about the narrative and more in service of the cinematography.  Which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing but personally, I always feel like the story comes first and goal of the cinematography should be to compliment and enhance the story, not call attention to itself. 
  
In 1917 the camera work was definitely all about the story.  Which makes complete sense given how much of a chameleon Deakins is and how his style can change so much between films in order to suit the narrative above all else.
  
Here the cinematography was completely focused on putting the viewer right there in the mud with Tom and William.  You are right in the trenches with these two young men and this was one of the only war films to really make me understand just how awful and hellish it was from the perspective of the individual soldiers.   It really illustrated to me that these guys don't have this big, strategic overview of the war but for them it's just about surviving one moment to the next and trying to stay alive long enough to get home to their families.  It was beautifully done.",emi5z3

The run up top was ""epic"", but almost a relief in comparison. The actual tension lived in the trenches below.

From Wikipedia

At first light, around 0400 hours, the battalion emerged from the dugouts and took up its battle positions. Much of the trenchwork had been destroyed by the artillery bombardment, as had the field telephones, so that, when companies were sent to their battle positions, contact with their battalion headquarters was lost. Runners sent to attempt to re-establish contact were all too frequently killed by the continuing artillery fire. Despite this, several determined attacks by units of the German 50th Infantry Division were beaten off. Furthermore, the Devons were able to rake the road from La Ville-aux-Bois to Pontavert with fire, severely disrupting the flow of German reinforcements, supplies and ammunition, upon which the Germans were dependent for continued success.[7] It soon became apparent to the Germans that Bois des Buttes had become a significant obstacle to their progress, so that it came under attack from both A7V tanks and the Imperial German Army Air Service. 

By 0700 hours the forward companies had been all but wiped out and the battalion surrounded. At 0830 the battalion commander, Lt Col Anderson-Morshead, withdrew the remains of his headquarters company and reserve company to the reverse slope of the hill, from where they continued to harass the advancing Germans. At 0930 hours, German troops, including artillery, were seen advancing from Juvincourt in the direction of Pontavert. Col Anderson-Morshead divided the 50 survivors of the battalion into two groups and moved them from the hill down to the Juvincourt-Pontavert road to engage the advancing Germans on two flanks. The Germans were initially thrown into confusion and an artillery team was destroyed, but they soon recovered and attacked in force. More Germans attacked from the hill that the Devonshires had so recently left, and Col Anderson-Morshead was killed. Short of ammunition and greatly outnumbered, the survivors conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Aisne river. Some were captured when they ran out of ammunition, others swam the Aisne and were captured by Germans who had reached the south bank before them.

In all, 29 officers and 552 other ranks of the 2nd Battalion, the Devonshire Regiment, were killed or captured that morning.[8] Between 40 and 80 survivors managed to cross the Aisne river and canal and rejoin the retreating British forces. However, the battalion significantly delayed the German advance, giving the French and British time to arrange ad hoc defences that brought it to a halt a week later.[9]",emi5z3

Most soldiers are not natural born killers that can shoot the wings off a fly much less reliably hit a man center mass. Even with extensive training, the amount of adrenaline coursing through you when you're shooting at someone can cause even the most subtle of tremors to send a bullet way off course.

You have a lot of soldiers who weren't natural born killers and who didn't want to kill that much, then you have the challenge of actually hitting someone. Plus I don't know much about firearms; did the massively-produced firearms of 1917 aim as well as modern firearms?

I am a complete sucker for movies. I get drawn into an incredible film like this and even though I saw bits the whole thing captivated me. So it did leave me speachless.

\> I also didn't understand how after the plane crashed you see two men  standing over them and all of a sudden it pans and there's a convoy of  40 people next to them. 

Time is not the way it seems in this movie. When they reach the German trench they say, ""we finally made it!"" because it didn't actually take them the 5 minutes they took to get there to get there -- there are symbolic time jumps. Which is also why the convoy appeared and left so quickly.

There are many people in the world who can understand a language and speak little bits of it -- which they both do.

The reveal that he had a family shows he had a lot to lose but he did it anyway.

Also, I'd initial viewed the scene with the French woman and the orphan as symbolizing the life he could one day have if he lived, the opportunity to have a family. In the midst of immense danger, it seemed like a cruel joke that he had to leave safety, warmth & love (what I think we all want in life) to return to the danger and chaos.

fhmjnjd,"I saw it this morning. While watching it the thought went through my head that the difference between 1917 and Dunkirk is Dunkirk is spectacle with story whilst 1917 is story with spectacle. 

Both great films but just done differently. 

In a way, 1917 felt much closer to Saving Private Ryan to me in the cannon of modern war flicks. SPR was a story to save a man to find personal and outward salvation of self and others. 1917 felt very similar in that you knew one of the two British soldiers was going to die yet that journey to save a platoon of men was the vehicle to find personal salvation or at least a sense of ""i know what we are fighting for"".",emi5z3
fhlh55o,"I really liked both but this one has a bit more heart IMO. It probably helps that we are just following these 2 guys so it's really up close (often literally) and personal, whereas in Dunkirk you keep switching between different characters that don't really interact (The pilot, the British commander, the boat guy, and the frenchman see eachother, but never meet IIRC).

But they are sort of a different beast I think. Dunkirk really tried to capture the evacuation in it's entirety with all the elements that played a part (except the German perspective). They kind of have to switch between groups if you you want to paint a more complete picture. Pretty much the opposite of 1917, which takes a little snippet of war. Just a single mission of these 2 guys.

If I may draw a comparison: 1917 is more of a Saving Private Ryan in that regard, sticking with the same people and just showing what they are going through, and Dunkirk is more like The Longest Day; Having all these different perspectives.",emi5z3

Of all the ways he could die, being stabbed off screen wasn't all that dramatic. Although, I realise it probably wasn't easy to do something more elaborate given the restriction of having to make it look like one shot.

I also think he should have died later in the film. It would give time to develop the characters a little more and make the death more emotional.",emi5z3

Also, there were witnesses, and it at least showed the general was intelligent enough to know what the consequences would be if he ignored these orders.

ff49cl1,"My thoughts exactly. As impressive as everything was, for me, this sort of thing detracted from the realism the film seems to be going for. Of course, these details are explained away by the 'race against time factor' and the need for the main character to press on, but all these exciting events lining up together the way the do really does end up seeming a bit too perfect.  For example, watching Saving Private Ryan, I can't say i spent much time gawking over the filmmaking mechanics, at least not during the film, I'm just totally enthralled in the film itself. In 1917, i'm constantly reminded of the continuous shot technique which only further reminds me that this is just a film, that there is a a crew of people standing behind the camera following these two actors around on a giant set.",emi5z3
ff4gw2v,"Well put. I have no problem with the one-shot technique itsself, in fact its awesome, but it does present all these pacing problems since everything in the story happens in ‘real time’. That means filler... but since they can’t have any filler, you get a somewhat artificially compact journey that doesn’t really make sense when you begin to think about it.

The walk through the trenches was unrealisticly short , because they needed variety in scenery. The car ride was what, 5 minutes? In other movies you can just cut and make a longer ride implied, but here you have to see everything — so its strangely short, yet almost too long for a movie.

That's because just like Tolkien you mentioned, 1917's story is essentially a retelling of the classical myths. In particular, it's the classical epic story of katabasis.

2. Hero descends into Hell
3. Gets help from other heroes
4. Finds oasis in the darkest depths, temptation to stay

There were *some* signs to the German retreat having been somewhat hasty (e.g. the coals still being warm) and maybe some soldiers of got lost on the way but it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense either (because you wouldn't construct another defensive line for months and then evacuate in a disorderly fashion). I think not going into details too much could be seen as a strength of the movie. The soldiers Sco encountered could just have been patrols or scouts maybe, it doesn't really matter. Historically, some WWI soldiers also missed their targets ""on purpose"".

1. When the plane crashes, you can somewhat attribute the following tragic situation happening because they dawdled. Instead of continuing and focusing on their mission at hand, they stopped to watch the dogfight, in their youthful naivety.
2. The lady and the baby were a foreshadowing to the very ending shot, that shows the Schofield had a wife and children himself.

They, like all his superiors, were in for one scene, for specific plot points.",emi5z3

I think they could have done well with a little different cinematographic work by having him weave left and right through structures.

&#x200B;

That being said, they were all running after him instead of aiming and shooting, so I can give it a pass.  But I never felt the same suspense as the quiet scenes in those ones because after they graze past without hurting him so much they just lose their danger value.

~~Also, the misses on the bridge and ensuing scene are also a bit of a negative for me.  I'm no expert but for how much he pops his head up in the same position he should have been dead.

""It is not impossible that among the English readers of this book there may be one who in 1915 and 1916 was in one of those trenches that were woven like a web among the ruins of Monchy-au-Bois. In that case, he had opposite him at that time the 73rd Hannoverian Fusiliers, who wear as their distinctive badge a bassard with ""Gibraltar"" inscribed on it in gold, in memory of the defence of that fortress under General Elliot; for this, besides Waterloo, has its place in the regiments history.

...I daresay this reader remembers, too, the white tom-cat, lamed in one foot by a stray bullet, who had his headquarters in No-man's-land. He used often to pay me a visit at night in my dugout. This creature, the sole living being that was on visiting terms with both sides, always made on me an impression of extreme mystery. This charm of mystery which lay over all that belonged to the other side, to that danger zone full of unseen figures, is one of the strongest impressions the war has left with me.

...Indeed, the landscape in which we lived at that time had something about it of primeval Africa, with two mighty forces of nature locked in conflict there. It was only now and again that one caught sight of a brownish-yellow fleeting shadow against the desolate countryside that stretched on and on before one's eyes; or heard, after creeping through the wire at night, a whisper or cough from a post. The sound of a transport, a cloud of smoke from a fire hidden from view, fresh chalk spoil thrown out on the tortured ground, the monotonous duel of the guns stretching on from week to month - those were signs we puzzled over as though they were the runes of a secret book or the spoor of some mighty and unknown beast that had come nightly to drink.

As time went on, it grew more and more dangerous to lift a corner of the veil that fell like a magic hood over the spectre that was at once so near and so fatally far off. Raids undertaken to get a glimpse of the enemy's lines and some information about what was going on there became less frequent and more exacting as the volume and mass of war material increased. A more and more terrific barrage had to be put down before ten or twenty picked men, armed to the teeth, could make their occasional and exceedingly brief appearances in the opposing trenches. What the survivors brought back with them the memory of a rapid and frantic glance into Vulcan's white-hot cauldron.""",emi5z3

ffc1y3j,"Considering the context of his exact situation, would it have been reasonable to display more trench warfare? There's so much to tell about WWI and this is just one guy's day being shown and there was plenty of hell to see. Not every day of every single trench and battle had the upmost hell going on like we've heard about looking back. Would've been less believable if the writers tried to force all the atrocities into it in my opinion",emi5z3
fmk1jz3,SERIOUSLY put yourself in Mackenzie's shoes for a minute he believes that the Germans are on the run and he could deal the final blow that will finally end the war which made him so bitter and cynical in the first place then a random Lance Corporal barges in saying the attack has been canceled hes angry and frustrated but not at Scho but he's angry at the indecisiveness of command of course Mackenzie would snap at him,emi5z3

fecxajx,"They were indeed trying to save the pilot. They are still people and when you see someone trapped in a burning plane, for most the logical thing would be to help them, enemies or not.

For example: the incident between Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler is my favourite WW2 tale.

Also really liked the movie, the attention to detail was amazing. Although I agree on the ""compressed time"" argument, it didn't ruin the movie for me af all",emi5z3
fed1isk,I think there was a lot of respect for pilots during the war.,emi5z3
feeuftc,Yeah they tried to save the pilot... all I could think during that scene was how they should have shot that guy immediately. I half expected him to shoot one of them from the cockpit while they tried to pull him out.,emi5z3
fefydo3,"Definitely agree with the 9/10, I would say 96/100 with the -4 being tiny tidbits that hardly retract from it.

&#x200B;

I enjoyed the pilot scene and Blake's death caught me by surprise, but throughout the whole movie we just see the Germans as the ""bad guys"" without a lot of time to dive into their humanization minus the short scene in the basement (which is immediately followed by the tripwire, sort of ruining the previous moment).  I mean for someone who doesn't know anything about WWI, they must leave the theater assuming every German during the war was a drunkard, sadistic, terrible-shot, evildoer.  And don't get me wrong, war is war - but I just think with the themes of the film, we could have been given something where they moderately humanize both sides to further emphasize the pointlessness of battle.

&#x200B;

A main theme in the movie is anti-war, so I felt like humanizing both sides would have been nice.  That being said, it doesn't detract from the movie, and those hit points along the film are one of the reasons I left in awe.  Fantastic work.",emi5z3

The infection wouldn't have set in quickly enough to hamper his progress and it didn't seem to affect his usage of the hand for the <24h timeframe he was under.  But in a week he's gonna be hurting... if he survives.",emi5z3

fej3oka,"> (1) The injury to Schofield's hand (follow by him plunging it into a corpse) - I thought for sure this would lead to infection and/or complications later on, but nope, bandage it, move on, never mentioned again.

Off-screen Schofield would probably need to amputate his hand after the end credits though. Antibiotics weren't really a thing yet IIRC.",emi5z3

fhvq4lq,"recommend looking into that further. They truly  were vast networks of *multiple tiers.*

&#x200B;

I liked that shot when they came out of the forest overlooking the untouched plains. It gave a sense of an auxiliary line feeding into this incomprehensible web. But keep in mind that was just a fresh line, indicated by the fresh gravel piled walls, lack of mud and puddles, and lush hills in no man's land. It was a great contrast to the originally depicted lines --- Heavily reinforced walls, deeper, and even in the Germans' lines comprising of concrete structures.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind some of the battle lines had quite some time to expand and improve what was in place, and build on their ""trench 101 runbook"" throughout the years.

&#x200B;

Edit - to add, the first scenes gave such a chilling sense of ""I could no way stay sane living there"" -- the little cubby holes to hide all day in the British side and the underground barracks on the German side. Just imagine shelling all day and night to pair with the already grim living",emi5z3
fl1fcrn,I loved how it showed the loneliness between the two in a 2 second scene,emi5z3

fhhtph9,"My partner and I went to go see this because my grandfather is from Calais and he rarely spoke of his time before moving to the US, he's since passed away. I'm always trying to contextualize the information I find about my family through my decade long genealogy search, never being able to get anywhere because of the damage from the war. 

The family was vast; some from Lille to Guines to Nord-pas-de-Calais (where they left after the front of the house was blown off - blvd curie) how they survived in the main area of the action is beyond me. I knew I needed to see this.  

Then when that part came up with the woman and the baby my partner leaned over and whispered: ""Oh man, That's your Great Grandma!""",emi5z3
fipumxr,"Yeah, apart from the technical side the entire plot felt antiquated and even somewhat problematic. Every single british soldier in this movie is unselfish, compassionate and well-spoken, even rushing to save an enemy soldier who straight up kills one of them for it. Even Major Cumberbatch had good reasons for his behavior and meant well. The worst a British soldier is ever pictured in this is probably the leader of the truck-platoon. And he is just somewhat unpleasant and posh. I'd think Mendes is a nationalist if I didn't know he opposed Brexit.",emi5z3

Though seeing Rob Stark reminded me.of the good times lol",emi5z3
fehap6v,">When Schofield cuts his hand open on a barbed wire fence he also accidentally puts that same hand into the corpse of a German soldier. Do you think it will lead to a serious infection?

Critics said this film glorified war?? Wow, that's a reach. I thought it was horrifying and extremely relevant today. Nothing glorifying about it, I felt it was a very visceral warning.",emi5z3
fegodmf,"That's funny, there was nothing glorifying about being in Schofield's position at all.  

Sure he was a badass and had tremendous courage.  But he was constantly surrounded by the rotten corpses of his brothers in arms, put his cut up hand inside of one (infection guaranteed), was almost buried alive, watched his friend die, was shot in the head and survived, fell down some stairs and probably got a bad concussion, chased around by enemy soldiers, survived being slammed around rocks in the river rapids AND a waterfall......Schofield had it tough this movie.

This movie wasn't like Black Hawk Down, where you're surviving against the odds around your fire forged brothers, operating cool tech and weapons, being badasses and growing into hardened men.  WW1 was ugly and this movie almost exclusively showed the really bad stuff about war.",emi5z3
feg9nsy,"Critics are idiots. They did the same thing with Joker. 99% of the dross Hollywood puts out glorifies violence and war as a power fantasy for the ever-victorious virtuous. A production actually shows violence as shocking, as unpleasant, as consequential, as *violent*, and *that's* what they accuse of promoting it.",emi5z3
felta2p,"Same! I usually am up and ready to go once credits are rolling but I felt like I was in such a sacred mindset, I just needed to sit and listen. Recover is the perfect word to describe that! I think only one person in the theater got up right after, the rest of us were awestruck.",emi5z3
fev180i,"I was stuck wondering how the heck the Germans could construct really nicely landscaped trenches and shelters... including steel beams and accurately cut door ways and retaining walls.

I was already in awe of how nicely the English army made their trenches, I was wondering how and when they could have the chance to do the carpentry when bombs and bullets are flying everywhere night and day... then the German trenches blew my mind.... it looked like they had 6 months of ""truce"" to upgrade their trenches.",emi5z3

fgjttgx,"Newman is one of my absolute fav soundtrack composers. Here again he demonstrated he can be incredibly subtle and not even noticed, can be achingly beautifully melancholic, can bring down the walls when it is needed...

The way in which he can instantly create a mood by just the most economical and subtly musical and sonic elements (a barely audible electronic texture with just 1-2 notes on a piano hovering above it) is stunning.

Looking at the 22 tracks on the soundtrack album, it makes one realise how many times Newman was present in the film with his sonic seasonings without us realising it.

And then his melodic thinking... that final piece, Come Back To Us, shows how astonishingly melancholic and beautiful a melody on a cello can be made by him.",emi5z3

Robb Stark’s reaction was incredibly sad, and the music as Schofield was walking towards the tree at the end, leading into “Come back to us” and him finally getting to rest...idk what exactly it was, but that was one of the most emotional finishes to a movie I’ve ever seen.

fhkwdgr,"What I also thought was a tad off is how so many Germans were running after him while firing, even though he pretty much runs in a straight line a lot of times. Could be a heat-of-the-moment thing as they didn't expect him or something I guess, but it looked a bit weird at times how everyone kept missing him at less than 30m distance.

fegpatn,And that's just the bookends. There are other symmetrical events such as the cherry orchard that were cut down and the cherry trees at the river while Schofield was traveling through it. There's also the slow walk through the English trench in the beginning compared to the mad dash Schofield had to do near the end in and above the trench. The midpoint of the movie was the hard cut that happened when Schofield was shot by the German sniper.,emi5z3

fdsbs3j,"I keep thinking about the opening shot of the movie and how that factors into who the story is about. Schofield is sitting up and his face takes up most of the frame, while Blake is laying down behind him (like a corspe?) with a helmet over his head as both are trying to nap. Also as this opening moves along, they often pay more attention to Schofield's expressions than Blake's once they learn their mission and are moving down along the trench.",emi5z3
fdzhc9c,"I figured one of the two guys wouldn't make it but it seemed rather early in the film to kill off one of the two main characters. I also surmised that Schoefield would be the one to die. However, after Schoefield survived the booby-trapped trench, I began to think Blake might be the one to die.  I was just surprised how he died. That German fighter pilot...the film's most loathsome character by far. Didn't see that coming. Schoefield was also really lucky with all the shots taken at him and not getting a direct hit.",emi5z3
fdzdt7c,"There's was one guy who thanked him just after he delivered the message. And there was also Blake's brother.

fe03jzu,"I don't really see why they would have. Maybe in some Hollywood movie they would have but in reality grenades don't really go off on their own. A grenade will only really go off once the pin has been removed, which in itself is hard enough to do. I'm pretty sure that the shock wave of that explosion was not strong enough to somehow set off the nade without pulling the pin, or even strong enough to somehow dislodge the pin. Either way, I'm no expert, and this movie is fucking great imo and it wasn't even something I had noticed.",emi5z3
fe101mq,"I immediately thought that he should've used the grenade when he was pinned down against the sniper in the second-story building.

Because what transpired is less believable. We have his POV, and we can't see anything but darkness inside that window, we don't even see the flash of the sniper's rifle.

I muttered under my breath: ""throw the grenade in the window.""

But instead, apparently, from that low angle, he is able to guesstimate one or two shots that hit the sniper. The sniper goes quiet, which he took it to mean that he must've hit the sniper so he walked up those stairs to the front of the house. I would consider that very risky, and assume that the sniper had simply stopped firing to see if it would lure me out into the open.

And I don't want to think about this too much, however, those trucks that dropped him off have to back-up from that bridge. The sniper shootout occurs like 30-40 yards from where he got dropped off. And the shootout begins just a few minutes after he got dropped of. Are they not going to hear it, and provide some support for him from across the river?",emi5z3

fehhjwm,"Yeah, they did a ""all you have to do is pour water on your wounds and you're healed!"" thing in this movie so he could look pretty for the final shot (his persistent eye damage had since faded away from his makeup), but realistically Schofield is probably not long for the world.

&#x200B;

The hand infection, head trauma from both the cave-in AND falling backwards down the stairs headfirst, likely internal bleeding from the cave in and/or slamming into that big rock during his river adventure, and a good deal of blood loss... he'd be lucky to get up from that tree at the end and walk back to triage, much less make it through the rest of the war.",emi5z3
feg9k39,"I was in love with the movie by that scene, but when it arrived... holy shit. This is Lord of the Rings, this is Dark Souls, but this *actually happened*.

Seems like the germans in this film sucked at open combat so much that they could only HOPE to kill people through deceit and treachery (and even then it didn't always work) /s

-German sniper can't hit a man tiptoeing across a broken bridge 10 yards away

-German pilot who could only kill unsuspecting people in melee, after he had crashed

-German soldier wielding a knife gets strangled by unarmed Brit

ff38mam,"that's about what I thought too, in 1914-early 1915 the civility of both sides shined through but by 1917 so much attrition by each countries high command to ""bleed the other white"" was disgusting and led to so much loss of life..and those who survived forever changed",emi5z3
ff5lioa,"Yeah I found it a bit weird how every German soldier tried to kill the main characters. Maybe that would've been accurate to the mentality of the German soldiers during WWI, I don't really know, but they weren't Nazis and I didn't think there was that much bitterness between the sides that they'd want to kill each other at every opportunity.

I was almost expecting his brother at the end to actually be the same actor -for the sake of Schofield being able to find him easier and we would recognize him better - and then the brother would be like ""Yeah we are twins, but he's right, I am older. I just came out first""",emi5z3
fdw4p6q,"That would've been a lot more surprising if Will is not a far better actor than Blake. When Will was buried under the explosion, I was so shocked because I'm pretty sure Blake will be the one who bite the dust halfway, only because Will is a much better actor than Blake.",emi5z3

fdzmvyk,And his brother none other than Robb Stark,emi5z3

Right before they cross no mans land, Andrew Scott’s character asks the two to “settle a bet” on what day it is. They say Friday and Scott’s follows with “ha look at that none of us were right, this bloody idiot thought it was Tuesday”. It was the delivery alone that made me laugh.",emi5z3

Omg this movie had me sobbing. Brilliant, but I don't think my heart can handle a rewatch.",emi5z3

fejqnqt,"I assume you were lucky enough to avoid the trailers.

There are multiple scenes in the trailer with George McKay all on his own after they were both sent to do the mission together. 

Then no scenes of the other guy on his own. What's the most likely reason for that I wonder.",emi5z3

fewl4jj,"To me it was ""Be in WW1 for two hours"". A lot of the criticism seems to come from a place of it not having much of a story/dialogue, and that's valid, but it didn't seem to me like that's what the director wanted to focus on. I liked it a lot, for my part.",emi5z3
feww3ey,"Personally I'm fine with that, different movies have different purposes. The equivalent would be Gravity; an absolutely captivating movie-going experience but not necessarily the most interesting script ever.",emi5z3
fezmhqd,"It felt a lot like a video game to me - each segment feeling very isolated from what came before and after it (ironically, given the single-shot trick), like going from one level to another. 

And the incidental characters were reminiscent of NPC's - existing only in relation to the main character, rather than being independent characters in their own right.

Plus the on-rails camera following behind the main character, like when they're walking up the down trench at the start, is straight out of video games.",emi5z3

Sending two people is the best way because if you sent more, things could get complicated. If people get injured, separated, or died, it'd make the act of getting the orders to stop the battle less likely to happen in the 16 hour time frame. And even with all that said and done, 1,600 people is a lot to try and save, but overall in a war that cost 17 million the best you can do is send two people to try and stop it. If he failed, well, everyone tried their best. There are other more important battles and moves to be made and more new troops being shipped over every day.  
Fun fact though, troops were not moved by trucks in ww1. The motorized vehicle was a pretty new invention and the technology to transport that much weight over that uneven of terrain did not exist. WW1 soldiers marched everywhere.",emi5z3

At the start of the mission, he was extremely jaded about military service, overly cautious and closed off emotionally (says he has nobody to go back home to, despite the fact that he does).  He had served in a prior military campaign before the movie (I forgot the name of it) and it clearly traumatized him.

But spending time with Blake, who still has optimism and life to him, and then watching him (senselessly) die put a BIG time spark into him.  Blake had a love for his brother and family, and Schofield personally saw to it that Blake's mission was fulfilled.  Schofield came alive again, reawakened as a soldier and fulfilled the mission against the odds.  

And at the end of the movie, he looks at the picture of his family.  Blake and the mission had clearly rubbed off on him and made him reappreciate the love of his family and go back home to them.",emi5z3

ftk0vjx,"It makes sense to me - the man is crushed, either because he's a decent man who doesn't want to send his boys to their certain deaths or because of fear of death.  PTSD was prone to strike any rank at any time.

This one in particular was fucking intense.  He's just dying, you hope he's not, your so pulled in, the poor guy never got to eat breakfast, he didn't really have a choice, he's trying to help a fellow human,the way he turns pale, bleeds out, your holding your breath, there's no cut, Blake just stops doing anything, the music is just fucking perfect Schofield is internalizing and then suddenly the energy of the scene; the music, Schofield and you the audience memeber hit rock bottom and shift.  Then the scene changes, without actually ""changing scene."" 

He stands up and a few men arrive, and the scene is now behind us, without ever having any actual wall of seperation.

Masterful story telling by Kristy, Sam, Roger, the whole team.",emi5z3
fezdrbz,The way I saw Dunkirk was that Christopher Nolan tried to take the emotion out of the movie so that we would see it as a movie which focused on the batallion as a whole which removed character attachment from the audience. 1917 goes to great lengths to attach meaning to the main characters themselves.,emi5z3

It didn’t impact the way it did for most. I wasn’t afraid or tense. Some parts startled me. I read in here that it was akin to a horror movie for the sheer fear of war, but I didn’t get any of that. The only part that sparked a true reaction out of me was the rat hitting the wire. I didn’t feel many emotions from it.

But the scene where he’s running alongside the trench was incredible. And the score was just so damn good.",emi5z3

ffvjaxh,"I thought the movie looked beautiful and the way it was shot was fantastic. But I can't help but feel if the movie wasn't designed to look like one shot id feel much more negative about it. 

Story wise I thought it was fine. Nothing bothers me more than when a character is on a timeline and stresses that significance, but then takes his time. When he wakes up after being blasted and it's night time he should have kicked it into overdrive. 

The movie has. 79. That's a great score.",emi5z3

This x100000. I think the movie was remarkably impressive from a technical standpoint. But from an emotion/story standpoint.... I didn't have much feeling at all. And I have a strong feeling a lot of that is due to every major moment being in the trailers. It's almost insane how they managed to fit it all in there.",emi5z3
fefpzde,"Not only do they avoid getting hit, but the main actor survives after a bomb goes off and covers him in debris and then later he gets shot and goes unconscious...but he keeps going as if nothing is wrong. The plot was that of a video game and that drastically reduced the stakes. 

I actually left the theater after he was shot and passed out long enough for it to become night (just not realistic) but then some how wasn't then also injured too bad that he could just continue running as if nothing happened.",emi5z3
fdpe5gg,"Agreed completely. Feels like the story was just a means to allow for the impressive technical nature of the filmmaking, rather than the filmmaking being a means to tell an impressive story. I do enjoy witnessing great shots like that, but this is a movie I'll never watch again. Maybe I'll watch individual scenes on Youtube in the future just to take a more careful look at the takes and the nuance of them, but definitely not worth sitting through the whole thing again.",emi5z3
fdpinir,"I don’t watch trailers for movies I know I’ll watch. The only thing I remember from the quick snippets was the pilot crash, and I’m lucky since I forgot that too",emi5z3
fdpejla,"Couldn’t agree more. The first act is incredibly tense (the scenes of them walking around open field are particularly nerving), but everything after that was a bit of a letdown. That’s mostly due to extended shots of not much happening, punctuated by moments of superbly shot war/action sequences that, unfortunately, lose most of their punch because we’ve seen them already in the trailers. 

Still, it was visceral and unique movie going experience. I would recommend it, be it with reserved expectations.",emi5z3
fdpderh,"I don’t know if I’d say I agree with you completely, since I did enjoy it, but at times I felt like the movie dragged due to the “one shot” nature of it.

fduvsgy,"

On the topic of Tom's death, while it was only a few minutes for him to die, in ""movie minutes"" it was much longer. Keep in mind, this whole films takes place over what I believe is a little over 6 hours. So with this being a one shot, every minute is about 3 times longer in ""movie minutes"".

fdqcwqv,"It's comparable, but I'd give Dunkirk the edge. 1917 has some really great moments, but it doesn't have that ""constantly mounting pressure"" feeling Dunkirk had, plus there are some fakey looking CGI shots, which never cropped up in Dunkirk",emi5z3
fdqljwz,"I preferred Dunkirk. I viewed Dunkirk as a ‘slice of life’ film that is not meant to have a dramatic story with deep character exploration, it was simply a film to show the realistic horrors of war in a visceral and unrelenting way over a short period of time. Which I was profoundly affected by as it really was the first film that made me really feel how terrifying war is.
1917 imo is more similar to Saving Private Ryan, where the characters and story are key. However, 1917 is also technically exceptional (Deakins is the GOAT). I did however feel at times it was more traditionally dramatic. Which isn’t my preference.",emi5z3
fdsxej5,"This isn't the best place to ask that question cuz this sub has a massive MASSIVE erection for Chris Nolan, so he's going to get the edge in every comparison. 

That being said, these are both great movies. Dunkirk is a bit overrated by the sub, as usual, but just a bit. I do think 1917 is on a whole other level. The cinematography is out of this fucking world...fucking Roger Deakins did it. The tension is different though. You can't really compare the two because one's real life and the other was(as far as I know) fictional. You knew the guys were going to get off the beach in Dunkirk. You knew the boats were going to come in and save the day, that destroyers were going to get sunk, etc etc. With this one, you really don't know what's going to happen, as it's an original story.

1917 also has the added benefit of being WW1. WW2 has been played out quite a bit the past couple decades, but WW1 has gotten hardly any hollywood productions. Definitely go see it while it's still on the big screen. It's worth it.",emi5z3

fdromin,What war movies have you seen since Dunkirk?,emi5z3
fdt32j5,"That whole sequence is my least favorite in an otherwise brilliant movie. He runs into an enemy soldier in an open courtyard, declines to use his weapon, runs away, avoids taking any hits, kicks open a random entryway, immediately finds a random french woman who he communicates with bizarrely and plays with her baby, and all the while no alarms are sounded regarding his presence and he doesn't run into the enemy soldier again.",emi5z3

fduw2i0,I wouldn't say they were well-hidden. I found them to call a lot of attention to themselves. Things like the screen briefly going dark when entering the trench or a soldier conveniently walking in front of the camera and the like. They felt very clumsy and jarring to me.,emi5z3
fduzhg6,Probably saw it as a chance to play dead and avoid having to charge,emi5z3
fdw9sdo,"I had to chuckle at that moment and kept my eyes on the soldier he hit. I'm honestly not sure who is right or wrong here at the moment, but i'm quite sure he got up. He was even looking annoyed and putting his helmet on when he was running again to the left of the screen.",emi5z3
fdxmxm2,"I noticed this and just chalk it up as a mistake. Dude literally falls down and starts napping. The other guy he runs into later on falls down, lays there for a bit, before getting up slowly. IDK, that was the only big acting issue I noticed, took me out of it for a minute",emi5z3

ffrfp9m,"If you noticed in the movie, the German trench was much nicer than the British one, and it had concrete bunkers and underground barracks. That's because the Germans were the first to really dig in for the long haul, with the goal of holding onto their French and Belgian territory. Meanwhile, the British were trying to push the Germans out, and always anticipated that the war would turn mobile eventually, so their trenches were less accommodating as a result. And yes, they were dug by hand. Very tedious work.",emi5z3
fft87gs,"One way is to dig a trench in an area further back that is free from enemy observation and fire and then sap towards the enemy lines. That means to dig a trench (also called a sap) perpendicular to your own towards the enemy. Once the desired distance is reached, you dig a new frontline trench left and right from the end of the sap, thus turning the latter into a communication trench between the new and former front trenches. See [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/4f/29/a04f29cc3505b62cdb3ca3c346b3bb8c.jpg) photo for a better visualization.

I guess in some cases soldiers dug in under fire (while prone, of course), making first simple positions for prone firing. These could be deepened to standing firing positions, several of which would eventually be joined to make a trench.",emi5z3
ffriikf,"Imagine here: it’s 1914, you, a soldier, had been stopped in your advance. Now you are there standing in an open field while the enemy machine gun is firing at you from 100 yards away. You and your hundred other mates each have a shovel. Better start digging fast.

There were also other factors where smoke, dust, and shelling can suppress the enemy enough where you can dig the trenches at the start of the war. Plus it wasn’t modern war where infantry had automatic weapon, chances are only 1 in every 80 guys had a machinegun that was stationary instead of mobile. Most infantry in WW1 had bolt actions and most of the time they were trained to reload every shot to “conserve ammo”.

It gets even worse for the folks that have to go over just to repair barbed wires or recover the dead. Alot of the times they go out at night to do it and folks still die. Then there were those awkward moments when the enemy is doing the same thing and both of you have to decide whether to shoot each other or let em finish their wire repair too.",emi5z3
ffss1nw,">  I feel like having human beings dig these trenches would take forever

The explained this was a different group from their original one and with phone wires cut it's easy to see how they kept on their plan

>how the bridge is out like 300 feet down the road from where they get stuck in mud

why is that so hard to believe? they knew they were close to the town/river, the trucks drove for a few minutes, probably close to a mile in total between the house and the bridge.

>Will sat for like two minutes to listen to that guy singing, and that two minutes cost hundreds of lives as the first wave went over

He was mentally and physically drained. Imagine what he'd been through in the last 18 hours.  Friend dying, getting shot, running from multiple enemies, surviving the river, etc.  He's human, not a robot.

>when he hides from the German soldier in the ruined village, and finds a young woman with a baby in the basement

this was a great moment in the narrative of the film that you don't get the full weight of til the end.  Seeing the girl and the baby added so much weight to his mission because he could relate to it and wanted to save Blake's brother.

> The German soldier would of course have immediately reported what he saw and send a scouting party to find Will

These germans were left behind by the organized retreat (or they abandoned as the one was beyond drunk).  They were clearly not organized and also could have been deserters.

Story was as straightforward as it gets, Germans were pretty much stormtroopers in terms of effectiveness, dialogue was uninteresting, and overall I didn't really have any investment in the characters or really felt the suspense as much. 

I feel like its a very Dunkirk esc movie in terms of gritty realism, technical achievement, and pacing but failed to really get the audience as interested or invested as Dunkirk did. It also felt very shallow in terms as a war movie, especially from the SAME director as Jarhead. Super let down.",emi5z3

fdrbiyw,I had the exact same thought.,emi5z3
fdrfg2u,"This lad did think something similar in the moment, but chalked it up to the same *sneakiness* in which they appeared to begin with. 

Remember, we were introduced to these characters immediately following the explosion of an aircraft, and at no point did we *hear* them approaching. I specifically remember wondering how on earth they got so close to the main characters, without either of them detecting their approach - as their proximity led me to believe that certain events that played out should have been avoided if they were truly as close as they seemed to be.

I don't have an explanation for this phenomenon, but I did question both of these moments:

\- When they first appeared, and how they got to their position in such a large number without being detected or making any noise whatsoever

\- When they left, and why they didn't return and respond to the German shots being taken almost immediately following their departure, as they made it clear that they were part of a caravan that wasn't traveling very quickly at all.",emi5z3
fdt6hb8,"Okay, look at it this way. You're sitting in a window alone with maybe 20 rounds on you and something like 60 people show up across a river from you. There is absolutely no way you'd decide to just start shooting unless you had a death wish. 

The trucks left before he even started crossing, and those convoys DO NOT stop unless there is something in the way. They most likely heard the shots behind them but they were probably almost a kilometer away by the time the first shot went off.  From what I've heard personally from veteran accounts (at least of WW2), they'd remember sitting in a convoy and they'd even run over corpses. Germans would set traps and place bodies or obstacles in the way so that the driver would try to avoid them and drive straight into the traps. I was told a disturbing story of being in the passenger seat and there was this body of a dead soldier. He had blue eyes and such a nice face. The wheels went straight over his face and completely flattened it because there is no stopping.",emi5z3
fdrpakb,That was my complaint. He saw his friend get murdered and was almost sniped himself. He should be going all in on murder as opposed to tip toeing around,emi5z3
fdt6nfr,"I think he was just being pragmatic with who he killed. 

The pilot just stabbed his friend, and could have hurt his friend or him more, so he shot him. 

The sniper in the building was shooting at him, so be shot back until he killed him. 

Then in the town, he wasn’t sure if the guy was an enemy, and when that guy started shooting at him, he ran and hid (where he found the girl and baby). 

Then while leaving the town, he accidentally came face to face with a German guy, tried to compromise with him and be quiet, but the guy yelled for help, so he killed him to keep him quiet. 

The other guy in the building didn’t have a gun at first, so in the moment he thought it would be easier to just run away from him, instead of struggling to kill him. That guy found a gun and chased and shot at him.",emi5z3

fevz6ht,[deleted],emi5z3
ff9kfjn,">Also two parts about the trucks that picked him up concerned me. Obviously how he didn’t hear them pull up, and also how the trucks just disappeared after he got sniped at. Did they leave by then or did they hear the shots and not bother to help?

I can only think this was a pacing/one-take challenge. There could have been more time before he reached the bridge to explain that issue. I thought it was also weird how it went from his friend dying to suddenly there's a whole group of soldiers there. There was no reason why they couldn't have been heard before and noticed. It would have made little difference to the friend's death if they simply wouldn't have arrived on time to help.

> Didn’t make sense on who milked the cow. The germans wouldn’t have bothered to do it. after all, they killed the other cows and then they didn’t even take the milk

For some reason I was expected them to find somebody who hung themself or something like that. The whole place seemed disturbing. Raw milk can stay good some time, but obviously it had to be fresh enough; I was thinking the ""milker"" had very recently died. Not a big deal in my opinion.",emi5z3

fdu7aeg,"I'm pretty much in agreement with you.

I think it was a very good movie, but I personally wouldn't put it anywhere near my Top 10 war films. Top 10 film of the year, sure, but I felt Parasite, OUATIH, The Irishman, Ad Astra and Knives Out were all superior.

My biggest feeling after watching it is... It could have been so much more. It truly could have been one of the best films of all time. Take for example another great technical marvel of the past decade, Mad Max: Fury Road. That's a movie that is roughly 80% action, yet had thematic depth and dynamic characters resulting in a story that was more emotionally satisfying to me. At times, 1917 felt like its plot and its characters were only there to serve the technical ambitions of the film, rather than the other way around.",emi5z3
fdzsf96,Yeah this thread is hyping it up alot but i dont think it was worth going to the movies to see it. There was some intense moments but the trailer made it seem like there would be alot more action,emi5z3
fdx0iqt,"I think that the movie did a good job with character development, taking into consideration the movie takes place in such a small timespan (maybe 12 hours or so?). The dialogue between Schofield and Blake did feel a little forced and formulaic but did a good job at delivering an interesting message of the shared experiences of soldiers on both sides.

All Quiet on the Western Front seemed to influence some of the dialogue  between Blake and Schofield. For example, the discussion of the pointlessness of medals when Schofield talks about his experience on  leave is exactly like Paul’s leave in the book. A lot of the dialogue showed just how similar the experience was on both sides (comparing rats in the trenches, food, etc) 

I don’t think you needed to know a character’s whole backstory to feel invested in them. I had the same emotional response to the German soldier Schofield strangled as I did to Blake getting stabbed and I think that’s the whole point Mendes was making about the horrors of war.",emi5z3
fdqi159,You prefer the previous work of Sam Mendes? That says it all.,emi5z3
fe09v9w,"I think just by necessity of the whole one-take concept, plot points have to be condensed a little. Blake dies, and then suddenly there's a whole battalion <50 feet away ready to take Schofield where he needs to go next. The film goes from day to night to day again, but the whole thing is shot in real time (unless Schofield was unconscious for 8+ hours, which is super bad for you). It almost felt like watching a play -- the back-to-back-to-back sequence of events stretches plausibility a little bit, but you kinda just have to roll with it.",emi5z3

IF you compare it to the walking scenes in Saving Private Ryan, you get backstory of the characters, development, details that let you know who or what you are dealing with, to me, there is no depth to the movie. This movie simply fell flat on the human side. Now I will still  say that the score, the cinematography, lighting and all effects are outstanding, but they over-score the movie. 

This movie is something that I went in hyped for and expectations were really high, so I completely understand that my expectations were high and had the chance of a let down. I was hoping for Hacksaw Ridge and I got Ad Astra, great hype but a bad movie.",emi5z3

I had high hopes given Mendes's history and all the hype, but to me, this felt far too safe and like it was built for a broader audience

I also think the no-cuts editing style was nearly pointless. In the beginning, I thought Mendes would make good use of it, e.g. he let the camera slightly wander to show an injured soldier being taken on a stretcher. I was also looking forward to see how he might use it to develop tension and emotion. But then going forward they made little use of it, and it just became a gimmick. Children of Men and Birdman are both great films that use long takes, and they actually use it properly (https://youtu.be/-woNlmVcdjc?t=53), but it felt like 1917 sort of forgot about how long takes can be useful and artistic",emi5z3

fegm5kb,"A film editor creatively joins together disjointed shots into a proper film narrative.  They select which shots to include in the film.  They choose the order in which the shots go into.  They choose whether to alter any shots.  They choose how to transition in between the shots.  All of that is done in post-production.  (Think of how Disney was able to drastically change Rise of Skywalker from JJ Abram's finished movie, that was all because of the creativity of a film editor)

Since this movie was designed to look like it was filmed in one shot, there are no disjointed shots, so there aren't any opportunities for a film editor to really flex their muscles.  All the hard work was done by the cinematographer.  The cinematographer had to sit down and plan all the shots that he could accomplish in the film.  The cinematographer had to position and move the actors and cameras a certain way so that the movie flowed from scene to scene.  The cinematographer had to create the opportunities on set for the film editor to do the stealth edits (the dark tunnels, taking the actors off screen for a split second, etc).

**Tl;dr**: The cinematographer was basically the film editor for this film.  There was nothing really for the film editor to do creatively, so that they could win an Oscar.",emi5z3

The story takes place over 16 hours in a 2+ hour film.

ff231g4,"I agree 100% with this and am lock step with you.  I was, to my own surprise, unmoved by this movie.  I marveled at its technicality, and kept on marveling at it, never once feeling like I was *there*.  It's a paradoxical experience, but all of the cuts, edits, sound manipulation and playing with shutter speed and what not in the opening of Saving Private Ryan gave me a much more visceral experience than the entirety of this film.  Just like Dunkirk before it, which was a marvel in editing which also left me empty, this film too lets its technical bravura overshadow whatever messaging the filmmakers intended.  Mendez and Deakins are the stars here, WW1 will have to take a distant second billing.",emi5z3
ff259ao,Funnily enough this is basically how I felt about Dunkirk. Because I love film I did sometimes feel distracted by the 1917 cinematography but I also think it actually contributed to the film and the characters. It made the characters and setting more intimate and the setting so tense.,emi5z3
ffmid4n,"Spot on but reddit does not appreciate these opinions until like a year after release so you're being labelled ""arrogant."" This is one of those movies Baudrillard would have had a field day on. It's a simulation of a simulation, an attempt to redefine the war movie through hyper immersion and videogame storytelling.

It's reeks of being manufactured within an inch of its life and this is its great irony: War and especially WW1 was an experience of pure chaos and carnage and yet what these filmmakers have done is essentially spit on the face of that demonic horror and it's inherent nature of destruction by using it as a means to entertain rather than teach. It's too orderly and curated, every scare and gore followed by sentimentality and the introduction of exposition and characters at just the right moment. I found the whole thing so cynical and transparent.",emi5z3
fgonxfz,"Although Full Metal Jacket is a classic, everyone's heard of it and probably watched it, 1917 did the war genre differently and that's where I think the appeal comes from. 1917 looks like its all one shot which is impressive (the behind the scenes videos on youtube are really interesting to watch and talk about how they did it), and also it's not really a ""war"" movie, they don't really show a lot of the war, its more about a different part of the war that people don't really talk about and I think that's appealing too. 

I do have to say though, the one-shot is impressive but not as immersive as I wanted it to be, and as immersive as the people who worked on it talk about.",emi5z3

However, I would not put Full Metal Jacket as a top war movie either. Even for Terrance Malick Thin Red Line is better. I guess Letters from Iwo Jima was IMO the best  American war movie made in recent years.

fe8hj8w,"I agree with astrath, firing a rifle and hitting your target is pretty difficult especially while moving. John Wick is not a documentary that is for sure. Movies have made it seem like shooting someone is effortless. 

I think what this movie is trying to really show is just another day in the life of the average soldier in WWI. Kind of like a fly on the wall. There is nothing special of our two protagonists, they are just the ones that have been assigned to this mission. It is especially poignant at the end of the film where Major Mckenzie states that next week they will probably be called upon to storm the Germans and that what Scoffield went through was only for a temporary reprieve.",emi5z3
fe7uih0,"The one thing I will say is that films in general give us a misleading picture of how easy it is to aim. Particularly the scene in the ruins where the soldier is running at them and trying to shoot - it is next to impossible to aim a rifle like that, which is why the soldier dives down to the ground to shoot the last shot. That is literally the only shot that has a hope of hitting, but it doesn't feel like that from the perspective of the protagonist.",emi5z3

fdx4tqt,"Pals Battalions were officially phased out in March of 1916 with the introduction of conscription, and generally abandoned with the losses in the wake of the Somme campaign. As the movie is set in April of 1917, replacements would have come from wherever the Army sent them; they did still try to keep replacements from the same region but that was not always expedient. 

Blake was sent not because he was from Devon, but because his mission was directly related to the survival of his brother who was serving with them. It was assumed he would want to complete his mission and not just avoid fighting for a bit.

While I am uncertain about the British army as a whole or the Cheshire Regiment in specific (I think that was the uniform they used), I know there were a few Sikhs that served in white units provided by the dominions. They likely would not have been wearing such a modern style of dastar though. His title of ""Sepoy"" moots discussion anyway since that rank was exclusive to the BIA.",emi5z3
fdxlurp,Would the German sniper have fired at the convoy though? I know I wouldn't have if I were him. Just let them go up a few miles and be somebody else's problem. Firing at them myself? That's just idiotic and you have to assume these guys have some level of self preservation.,emi5z3
fdx4q74,"On the second point, the 'Pals Battalions' idea was actually cancelled in 1916, after the Somme, after it became clear that while it helped with initial recruitment, it also meant that instead of seeing random colleagues die, already a tough task for anyone, soldiers were losing close friends in front of their eyes. It also meant that certain communities were being arbitrarily hit massively when their battalions were sent into the thick of it (there's a massive difference in impact between losing 100 men from towns all over the country vs 100 men from one town). I'm sure plenty stayed together anyways, but by the end of the war there were also plenty of mixed battalions, to my limited understanding.",emi5z3
fhwm8c4,"Absolutely agree on your thoughts on the one shot format. Seeing an example of how long takes can be used ineffectively really highlights how Alfonso Cuaron has mastered using them properly. 

There were so many moments where I thought the film needed to cut, or scenes that would have worked much better in some other setting but needed to happen at times that felt very unnatural or out of place  because the action needed to be continuous.

The pacing and lack of exposition didn't really provide a lot of insight into the relationship of the two main characters, and instead - the audience is just expected to *accept* and make assumptions about their relationship. This choice to immediately hop into the action does soften the blow of some of the more *impactful* moments throughout the performance, as we really aren't given a chance to *know* or *care* for the major actors in this production prior to some of the events that unfold.

This was the *weakest* point of the story for me, because i genuinely *wanted* to care about both of them, but I do think the overall show was still oscar-worthy in many ways outside of this one category.",emi5z3

fdpmuof,"Agreed. When blake dies the pacing comes to a screeching halt. I just felt no sense of danger because there weren't any other scenes of the enemy killing and making you regain a sense of danger until the last 10-15 minutes.

The cinematography is great but I've come to realize that the gimmick sacrifices some aspects of storytelling because you have to set time aside to account for changing scenes in a smooth fashion. It's the dilemma I had with Birdman, The Revenant, and this even though you can't complain about how well they're shot.",emi5z3
fds73g6,"I agree.  In fact, I really didn't like it.  It felt hollow to me. Putting aside the fact that sticking to just two tracking shots means that things like plot, characters and etc suffer (Your average FPS has more developed plot and character than this film), the tracking shots repeatedly stretch credulity to the point of absurdity. Every time the characters walk in any direction for a minute, there's either something new to see or something exciting that happens.

The most absurd sequence in the film is the best example of this (will avoid spoilers, but don't read if you want to be 100% pure): There is a whole dramatic scene behind a house that plays out in silence. Another character shows up and says ""Hey, we heard something and came to investigate,"" and the characters literally just walk 10 feet to the other side of the house, and suddenly there is a massive platoon there with 3 trucks, soldiers milling about and other soldiers trying to move a tree from the road with one of the trucks. How the fuck did that whole platoon appear out of nowhere, making not a peep? Why did no one hear them show up?

Shit like this happens constantly in this movie. A character will jump inside a window, being chased, and the enemies will completely forget about him, just so he can slow down and have a meaningful interaction with a random NPC. A character will fall 10 feet down a waterfall, and suddenly be in an entirely different country. In order for the film's tracking shots to work without being tedious, the director has to bend the rules of reality   
 and work under the assumption that the audience is repeatedly forgetting what happened just 20 seconds prior. It's completely absurd.",emi5z3
fduyn9k,">  It felt like either a theme park ride or watching someone else play a videogame to me, on rails and with that extra barrier in front of me for full immersion.

That's exactly what it felt like to me as well. Just watching the characters wander from set piece to set piece so they can each be shown off for a little bit before moving on.

It would also have helped a lot more to utilize editing for the purposes of letting time and distance pass. Not having any of that furthers the artificial feeling. There's only time for short little connecting segments before moving on to the next sequence.

The way that Tom/Will were almost always the focal point of shots also made it distracting and contributed to the artificiality of compositions. You never have a scene presented to the audience, you just see the character wandering through while the scripted sequences fire off in the background. The final ""over the top"" sequence was especially egregious in this regard.

It was an interesting experiment, but a failed one. If this had been shot more conventionally it might not have attracted all the attention from its gimmick, but it almost certainly would have been a better film.",emi5z3

I didn’t know about it going into the film but noticed it pretty quick and about 5 minutes in I was thinking, “When’s this one-take gonna end?” Then I slowly realized, around the time they got to the deserted German trench, that the whole movie was going to be like this. I nevertheless really enjoyed the movie and thought the one-take thing was neat for the most part.

But I guess I found it a little constraining and at times distracting, and similar to what you said I felt like I needed to see a cut at a few points throughout the movie. I can see how they intended it to support the idea of the story being a single, continuous journey though.",emi5z3

You're a pilot. You've just been shot down. Two enemy soldiers have captured you. Maybe they're nice guys, maybe they want to kill you. Ratios are tight and you're injured. 

Do you think they'll help you? Kill you? Torture you? You see an opportunity to kill one, then maybe shoot the second.

fdu3upo,"The pilot scene may be a little irksome, but the way I felt was, ""well, shit happens.""",emi5z3
fdu5s4m,"I don't think ""take no prisoners"" was the message of this movie (however I generally agree with you, I dislike how lots of war movies really push this).

We really only see a couple of Germans in the entire film, and none of them are really ""characters"" per se, they're just nameless, near faceless cogs in the war machine, chewing young men up and spitting them back out into the mud. After Tom is stabbed, Will shoots the pilot, and we spend the next couple minutes just watching Tom slowly bleed out. We aren't given any time to understand the pilot's motives, and we do not even take a moment to condemn him or use Tom's death as a ""learning"" moment. It is tragic, but had he not died there, then he could have instead been killed in the burning village, or within the German trench tunnels or in the opening wave of the British attack. Maybe both Will and Tom survive and successfully deliver the message, only to be killed by a wayward artillery shell a couple hours later. Even after handing the Colonel the message and stopping the attack, Will is told that for all we know, they may be ordered to attack again anyways the next day. The war is unkind, unfeeling and it does not care who you are or how you die.

So yes, it is true that 1917 tells us that war is cruel, confusing and arbitrary, but unlike many other movies, it does not use these moments to try and justify the war or the suffering and sacrifice of the soldiers. Tom's death may have strengthened Will's resolve to deliver the message, but it did not teach him that ""killing is necessary"", and did not change him into the archetype of the hardened veteran that ""now knows what he has to do to survive"". He only kills two other Germans in the rest of the movie, neither are glorified and do not give us any sense of closure.",emi5z3
fduwmw7,"It bothered me as well. There are two guys. The odds are really good that the other one is going to shoot you more or less immediately. Beyond that they were actually helping him. As a pilot he would be an excellent prisoner with a lot of potential intelligence value, so it's quite likely that he'd be treated fairly well.

The only way it makes any sense to me is that he's full of adrenaline, panicking, and making incredibly poor decisions without thinking about them. But it's still a very poorly-written sequence. Tom could easily have been killed in a much more reasonable fashion.",emi5z3
fdyc6rq,"> The scene with the pilot really, really bugged me. They showed mercy to this guy and saved his life, Tom even discounts Will's suggestion to ""put him out of his misery"", and then what happens? Tom gets killed. wtf.

fehx3lw,"I disagree very heavily.

In terms of focusing on the faces of the actors, the sets used were in my opinion literally the highlight of the movie. That first scene when they emerge onto the now deserted no-mans-land with the dead horses and other bodies was breathtaking. The later scene, walking through the ruined city with planes and explosions illuminating and casting shadows was captivating.

The Germans maybe? I did wonder that one myself.
I think he was concentrating on his mate dying, the burning barn was also probably masking the noise from the caravan.

By 1917 the war was 3 years in, the training by that time would have been looser and the rifles weren't as accurate as we expect them to be. The sniper should be hitting an exposed target on a bridge like that though.

Only the older one was blind drunk, again the war was 3 years in at that stage he was likely an alcoholic 

It was the casualty tent not the hospital, they tried to keep them where they would be helpful so they were near to the front

The cave explosion was a bit far fetched but maybe the Germans messed up somehow.",emi5z3
ffe7rh8,"1- no one that understands film making is really calling it a one take movie.

2- Probably a french farm hand. If you remember when they enter the german trenches there is a fire still smoldering, they were likely only about 6-12 hours behind the German retreat.

3 - I think this was a bit of a time dilation thing. I think the purpose there was that he was sitting with Blake's lifeless body for a lot longer than it seemed to us, just kind of lost in shock. Either that or the shock of the whole thing left him a bit blinded to his surroundings.

And they got there by crossing no man's land, which was empty, as the germans had retreated. The only reason crossing was a big deal for Scho and Blake was because the men at their entry point didn't believe the general that the germans had left, and neither did scho. This group likely saw the arial shots that proved otherwise, and thus were free to cross unimpeded.

4 - The shooting was bad, but I think thats more for the sake of the movie. Also rifles were notoriously inaccurate back then, so its not totally out of the realm of possibility. 

Historically as well this was technically towards the end of the war. The day the movie takes place on is April 6 1917, which is the day the United States declared war on Germany. Germany was basically totally exhausted by this point and rushing the remaining men (and honestly children) through bootcamp to get them to the lines. A lot of these soldiers would have been very, very poorly trained.

5- They are getting blitzed at 5 am because they're probably on a night watch in a ruined city in the middle of ww1. I dont think they really give a shit what time it is.

6- yeah geography was just for cinematic effectiveness, not necessarily realism, although in wave attacks they would build makeshift infirmaries pretty close to the trenches like this one, although I would say still quite a bit farther back than it appeared here. 

7 - The explosion in the tunnels wasn't meant to kill the people in the room, it was meant to bring the tunnels down. It was a structural bomb likely buried deep in a load bearing wall. I think the hope was that the tunnel would be full of British troops at the time rather than just two rag tag dudes.",emi5z3
ffa0svv,"Why do people have such an issue with all the bullets missing him throughout the movie? I'm no war expert but when I picture someone part of infantry that actually survived WWI, isn't that exactly what it must have been like for them?

Birdman has a transition too IIRC but is still referred to as ""one take"" because the camera is following Keaton 99 percent of the time.

fg7omqj,"While I don't agree with you on how much of an issue the small plot slips and war cliches are, I can recognize that they exist. But your comment about the obvious cuts is downright untrue. Are you sure you aren't trying to dislike the movie?

An obvious cut is when the camera literally cuts to a different perspective. The entire picture snaps to a new angle.  That does not occur a single time in this movie. There are only a small handful of cuts that could be called 'obvious' like the pitch black darkness moment and the jump into water. Everything else is CGI and only occurs when the camera starts floating around weirdly or zooms in really close to something.

Theres certainly stuff to criticize about the movie, but over 20 obvious cuts is not one. They did an excellent job of hiding the cuts they had to make. Implying they didn't is honestly laughable and makes you seem pretty clueless.

&#x200B;

Also the plot armor point is laughably awful too. Surely killing them both 30 minutes into it is FAR more believable. Man the movie would be just AWESOME if they both died and it was all just a weak ass failed mission. At some point you have to accept what a story is and stop trying so hard to dislike it.",emi5z3

Why did he wait for the german to shoot him in the first place? He opened the door, saw the soldier, waited for him to raise his gun and only then shot him, it looked pretty fake. The way he talked to the french woman and they both talked in their own languages but still understood each other was pretty ridiculous, too. The movie was beautiful, direction and music were a 10/10, but writing was mediocre, and at its best moments it was just another war movie.",emi5z3

There are more things to complain about, like some continuity and immersion-related issues (poor shooters, getting out of the water with almost dry clothes), the scene with the French lady that felt unnecessary (what was the point of it, considering the bigger picture?), the river scene that felt a bit cheap (oh shit, we're running out of time, so let's resort to a rather cliche plot device to make up some ground).  
None of these issues dampened the viewing pleasure, however.  
  
And from a technical point of view it was a showcase of utter brilliance. Music, sound effects, and especially the visuals. I've seen a lot of good-looking movies, but holy crap, this was in a league of its own. Not just the way every shot was framed, lit and propped up, but also because the visuals really added to the overall sense of imminent danger and threat (reminded me a lot of Sicario, where Deakins also masterfully used visuals to say much more than was just shown).",emi5z3

fdsb62d,"I had the opposite reaction to McKay's performance. Remember Schofield was picked by Blake to join him. Once they learn their mission, Blake is the one motivated by familiar love to reach their destination so he can save his brother. Schofield didn't want to go, was terrified of the idea of dying and never seeing his family again, and didn't even enjoy the rewards of the war (symbolized by rejecting the medal). After the midpoint, suddenly Schofield alone and has to complete the mission by himself. He does this out of a true sense of duty without any emotional attachment to the goal.

Also keep in mind that Schofield suffered a concussion, most likely had symptoms of hypothermia from the river and is pretty much exhausted from the amount of running he had to do since leaving Ecoust.

Add that all together and I can understand why Schofield seems emotionally outside the whole process, given that is who his character is plus the physical condition he had to go through.

Madden on the other hand, is both a great veteran actor and his character has to go through several emotions in the span of a few minutes as Blake's brother. So I think it is unfair to compare them and think that is a knock on the movie.",emi5z3

I think it's to show how differently they handled personal grief. He became emotionally distant and numb.

It's a pretty quiet movie dialogue wise imo. With how the movie's made dialogue felt limited.

The sniper should've hit Schofield when he was balancing on the bridge. It could've been written with him getting scraped by the bullet and falling in the water and then climbing to the other side and continue like it did after he got to the other side.

Points I disagree with:

Violence and gore were found in this movie, it wasn't overdone or tasteless.
People in bits and pieces, stabbing, strangling, being shot, burned, drowned and stuff like that.
(Good examples are the guys floating in the river, guys stuck in barbed wire, all the people mangled in the trenches and injured people at the end.)

The action choreography was done really well. You do know that combat is awkward?
 People panic, underestimate the enemy, get lucky and operate on adrenaline and these things were executed almost superbly.

Most of the deaths in this movie were caused by misplaced hope and that hope was a really big thing in this movie in case you missed it.

The German did not call out to Schofield because he also hoped that he was a friendly until getting closer where he decided to bumrush Schofield. People start panicking and do dumb stuff, happens alot everyday and everywhere.

The boring shots are there to set the area/scene. It gives you the viewer time to reflect on what you just saw, speculate on what you will see, set the mood of the scene, build suspense and focus on the environmental storytelling and or characters. 
Those shots being boring speaks more about you than the movie.

This movie is light on conventional ""action"", I agree, but you calling saving private Ryan an action movie is kinda hilarious since it's a war drama with some action in it. And I wouldn't say either one is a better movie since they differ quite a lot. 
And I find it kinda funny that you want overly choreographed fights in a war drama. 

All that being said I'll give some of my own opinions:


This movie had a couple of scenes where I had to just accept what was happening (the sniper scene for example) but I was so invested in the moment that only later did I come back to it and think that it could've been written a lil bit better.

I was really pumped up by every action scene in this movie since it took almost a horror movie take on war, and it fits so good in my opinion.

Nothing about the action felt extra safe, stabbing was quick, strangling was nerve wrecking and the final push was really strong. 

 All of these things would've been so easy to fuck up and I'm glad they didn't ever overdo it.

The world was beautiful, music was powerful and acting strong.

Some of the effects did not convince (jump of the bridge and a couple of other small things like some rats)

I really liked the flare lit town sequence since we are experiencing this with/as Schofield (after loss of blood , trauma of losing a friend and almost complete loss of energy, open wound in hand and head, blowing up and being stuck under rubble from said explosion)
Who is living out a literal nightmare in that moment, beautiful but terrifying

9/10 really good movie
Would recommend you to watch it again, this time with immersing yourself in it.",emi5z3
i4jjnao,"Hi there, I know your comment is a year old lol, but on your opinion what would a *good* action/war film be?

What's interesting to me is that Sam Mendes also did Jarhead which I think is much more grittier than 1917. To me, 1917 was an ode to his grandfather and much more of an artistic expression of the stories he heard from him growing up.",emi5z3
fkqtw3j,"I’d say Parasite was the most overrated movie of the year. Not bad, but not as great as the other nominees.",emi5z3
fiyq8ln,"In my opinion that's what made the film so good. Having it all panned in a single shot without any cuts really gives you a scale for the movie which draws you into the struggles faced.

The action is interspersed with the monotone parts of war, which is rarely shown in such movies, or even documentaries. And even when it was 'Monotone' with nothing going on, I feel that it wasn't there for nothing. Be it either giving us time to think, or to observe and listen to the scene or characters, such as the truck ride.",emi5z3
fe8somd,"In the film's defense, a lot of the events are based on stories that the Director Sam Mendes's grandfather told him about. War stories. The film is an amalgamation of different war stories weaved into one film.


Scenes like the German soldier still trying to kill his saviors mostly likely did happen in real life. 


As for the slaughtered villagers? Perhaps just more civilians caught in the crossfire? We're never given an answer.",emi5z3
fe9l6jv,"I liked the connection to the characters more in this one, but I understand the choice in Dunkirk to keep backstories at a distance (that's just not what that movie was about). 

1917 definitely makes me want to watch Dunkirk again. Both are high quality films, and I like how neither are ""Rah rah, war!"" movies. Both focus on wars that England ultimately won, but show tragedy of war to the point where we ask ourselves what ""winning"" even looks like. 

It's easy to tell the story of the courageous soldiers that saved Europe, but maybe it's more important to tell these stories of retreat as well.",emi5z3
feflcui,"For what it's worth I agree. Two solid movies, but I was just more gripped by Dunkirk. I'm struggling to put my finger on why but despite the long shot and focus on a small number of characters I found 1917 slightly less immersive",emi5z3

ffe9iui," >his deterioration was too fast

This really depends on what exactly the knife damaged. If it would’ve cut something like abdominal aorta or a damaged a vascular organ it’s not unreasonable that he expired so rapidly. Hemorrhage is no joke. A traumatic wound can mess you up quickly. I didn’t find his death scene that wild though but I’ll agree with you that Schofield’s recovery speed from injuries is rather far fetched. Otherwise I thought it was a great film.",emi5z3

fdtd712," I’d say it’s 10/10 in everything but story. Blake dying as early as he did + the promotional material for the film gave Schofield too much plot armor. All of his close calls rung hollow for me.

feh90s9,"Strongly disagree, a more heroic score would've been a cheesy letdown imo. The only part I didn't love the music was when he was running near the end at the final stretch, as the soldiers were running around him. The score got too heroic there for me.",emi5z3
feh7g3g,"I thought the score was good, not great. Agree that TN is better with the quieter scenes. I don't know that it should have sounded heroic at the end, though. I think the ending was bittersweet and served to underscore the futility of war. We leave Schofield at an uncertain moment - will he succumb to his injuries or does he survive and go home? No one knows. In the end as we see it, he's still alone, and the war goes on. Yeah, he saved many men from dying with his message, but Colonel Mackenzie's speech really hit home when he said that tomorrow there would likely be another message saying to attack at dawn. It's a pointless cycle of death.",emi5z3

That was seemingly confirmed by the picture he takes out at the end with a woman and a child on it saying ""come back to us"", or something of the like.

fdtr7d2,Personally I recommend smoking crack before watching. Maybe even do some cocaine. Really get's you into the movie. I was so into it I almost punched the dude next to me.

Quite a pity they would do that to a veteran who served in WW1,emi5z3

The cinematography, the sheer anxiety you get from nothing ever letting up for those two characters, the absolute fucking horror of WWI just got to me.

fdtpd0s,I think I agree they should have matched the distance they traveled to the distance they were supposed to travel a little better.    I guess the truck scene is the obvious one that should have been longer.  They were in it maybe 2 min traveling at 40-50 mph I would guess.  Its so immersive that I didn't think about it much the first watch but probably will when I watch it again.,emi5z3

On the other side of the camera, what does it say about an A-List actor being willing to sign on for just a bit part of such an epic story.

Beyond that, the answer is a bit more complex.

Often times, disabled airmen specifically were granted even greater leniency for a number of reasons (as non-infantry combatants, they were relatively harmless when not piloting an aircraft; airplanes were not effectively utilized as tools of inflicting casualties on infantry, pilots were 'civilized' aristocrats and officers, etc.)",emi5z3

This was spring 1917. I’m not even sure rudimentary tanks had even been used in war before. Even a year later when tanks became more common in the Western Front they still wouldn’t have been a good way to speedily get anywhere. They weren’t built for speed. You could outrun them. 

Planes were regularly engaged in battle. There’s a higher likelihood of a plane being shot down than two soldiers scurrying thru the ground. 

The film is structurally simple by design: it’s a mission and he is by design single minded. The “random” barriers are not random at all. They’re exactly the kind of shit a soldier in the Western Front would encounter.",emi5z3

A tank would be so so so much slower than going on foot. A plane? How would that work? You assume there are two airfields at these bases (only a few miles apart) they can use? What the fuck even is this take Jesus Christ. 

The attack was a trap. The Germans were ready for them and the Colenal in charge didn't know. Just about everyone involved would die. It's fucking simple.

Some people are very hung up on if something is realistic or not and for me, knowing that its not a documentary, I don't find that as important. Film, books and art in general are figurative after all and if they seem t*rue to our experiences*, that's more important to me personally. 

Like with Parasite, while some people were insisting ""it wasn't realistic"", I thought the logic of the world was consistent, the characters' experiences seemed true to the realities of inequality & poverty, and personally really appreciated the parallels to how the characters often were relegated to living like bugs/pests, even if it wasn't ""realistic"" a family would be >! trapped under a coffee table or live in an underground bunker. !<",emi5z3

I don't think Schofield was supposed to be some sort of classic heroic character. He was just a human being.

Treating prisoners decently, open and honest confrontations, these were unspoken rules to the British. That's why it's so hard for them to believe they're walking into a trap.

Trees in the film symbolizing humanity, or peace, or safety, however you'd like to put it. The entire farm is a place of vague comfort for Blake and discomfort for Schofield. This makes sense, given Blake's naivete in war and Schofield missing his home and family. Blake dies here. Schofield soon has his own brush with death and is pressing on for the idea that he needs to make his friend's death worth it. Then, he meets the family, which reminds him of his own, and he is able to feed the baby because he was in the farm. This is important, because without the farm where his friend died, he would have had no milk, and he never would have met the woman. True, he never would have lost his purpose and it certainly doesn't make the death a *good* thing, but it brings comfort to Schofield in that the farm had something to offer him, rather than take away.

That's my biggest gripe when less-than-stellar directors/DPs try and do oners. Every little piece of action feels like it's cued specifically for the camera.

Something about the killing by stabbing scene was so brutal because it's so... understated...yet deadly. There's no swell of music and in fact it happens off camera at first. You just hear ""no! no!"" and then he's stabbed. Movies will make you forget how deadly a simple knife is. So this was so shocking in how real it was.

Then the following scene where he gets swept by the river, climbs over the dead bodies and onto land and hears the singing---he joins the living again and regains hope. It's a beautiful sequence made even more beautiful when you have that in mind while watching it",emi5z3
fe6tel9,The re-watchability of this movie is off the charts for the cinematography alone. So entertaining. So nice to look at.,emi5z3
ff4q0it,That totally felt like a stealth video game level. Avoid the German at every turn and you can only move once the flare dies out and there's darkness everywhere. He even got one stealth kill in! 10/10,emi5z3

fegjx6c,"Yeah, and then the river definitely has some baptismal elements to it. Or if you wanna go darker, there's plenty of mythological undertones, reading it as a river of the dead isn't too hard considering the sequence ends with the floating bodies of civilians. The whole thing feels in some degrees like a journey into the underland. Lot of interesting symbolism and resonance happening throughout.",emi5z3
febknnr,You vastly overestimate how often bullets hit their intended target in war. Every man who did incredible things under fire like that was extraordinarily lucky.,emi5z3
fe6zig9,"Yeah, it felt very odd to me that random Germans would be scattered around the village in ones or twos without seemingly any coherent unit organization. Wasn't the point of them retreating that it was a carefully planned and executed trap?

Third year of the war, original units lost lots of members, all reintegrated into new units, most of those would still be British, so just one Indian here, one African there.

Absolutely *no* idea if this actually reflects reality in any way, but it seemed like that would be how it would be in year three and not just the filmmakers doing tokenism.

fe9k4ia,It reminded me of the death scene in the plane from The Grey.,emi5z3
fe00xxf,"“Small detail” nah, that was the entire point of his scene and his character. He’s a naive, selfless young soldier with trying morals, that eventually get him killed.",emi5z3
fdv8s1p,You didn’t notice that until rewatching? Small detail? That was the point of that scene. It was a pretty obvious  and big detail,emi5z3
feersa6,"I think that scene purposely reflected Schofield and Blake's characters really well.

Schofield, the older and more battle experienced of the two, said they should mercy kill the pilot whilst Blake, the younger, naive soldier wanted to save him, which ended up costing him his life.",emi5z3
fdu7odb,"that's what got me immediately.

he was going to get water and i was finally having a nice moment, a break of humanity, and then the screams...",emi5z3
fdw30lc,How is this a detail? Isn't it immediately apparent?,emi5z3
fdrin40,Rewatches? How.. Didn't it just come out lmao,emi5z3
fe3emfu,"I watched that bit and saw the big knife and was thinking ""get his weapons now!!!"" but I guess that's it when you're a green soldier and seeing this kind of trauma for the first time - you treat someone like a human and try to save them without thinking of the risk. 

Amazing scene.",emi5z3
fed3yq0,"""Small detail"" lol fucking idiot",emi5z3
ff4bssb,"It reminded me of the Saving Private Ryan line during D-Day: “Let ‘em burn!”

It sounds terrible until you think about how many friends they’ve lost to Germans. It’s what a “smart” soldier would have done for that pilot. 

To me, this movie will forever be the WWI companion to Saving Private Ryan.",emi5z3
fhw7yc9,"Yeah, it clearly showed that nice guys sadly finish last in those types of situations. War drives us to do inhumane things, and all source of respect or empathy is thrown out the window in those moments.",emi5z3
fsy2njm,"I'm really fucking late but blake was the one that said they had to go early and the one who rushed them through the barbed wire, as well as the one who chose to bring the german out of the plane and not kill him afterwards.  

He was the precise *only* reason he died, which is fucking amazing and heartbreaking because everything he did was for the good of others.",emi5z3

fdtdkhr,"
I see what you're saying, and it kind of bothered me at first too. My explanation to myself was that the dude was on the adrenaline high of all adrenaline highs. Goes through the stress and thrill of a dogfight, then experience of being shot down and realizing you're about to crash, crashing, then being on fire? Drops him back down to primal instincts and he sees British and reacts, no thought involved.

That's how I figured it anyways.",emi5z3
fdtv1r9,I think that the pilot thought that he would be tortured in order to gather intelligence. Pilots have way more information then regular soldiers and I’ve heard stories of this happening.,emi5z3
fdtnkj0,I think he thought he was going to be captured and saw his chance at an escape.,emi5z3
fe5ongg,That bugged me but I think it also killed alot of tension for the rest of the movie because you knew this one left over guy was not going to die before getting to the troops. So I was never worried about him dieing after that scene which is over half the movie.,emi5z3

fhhax2p,Even in WW2 there multiple examples of Germans and allies being nice to eachother,emi5z3
ffcmc8l,"Different ranks, lance corporal is one junior, but both had the same stripes. Not going to pretend to know much about it but I thought they were both lance corporal (I believe Corporal is 2 stripes but I might well be wrong) and everyone just said corporal because its easier",emi5z3
fgi4fa9,"They were both LCpls, but you often address them as ‘Corporal’. Fun fact, some cavalry regiments use the rank of Corporal of the Horse rather than sergeant",emi5z3
fdprahc,"This movie had some PHENOMENAL lines about the futility of the war, but Cumberbatch’s speech and especially the quote “next week it’ll be a different letter saying attack at dawn” was the best for me.",emi5z3
fdse3fi,"> I was happy that they didn't just make Benedict Cumberbatch some psychotic rogue commander

Especially after the earlier line about making sure there are witnesses when Will delivers the message. All I could think was ""please dont be a crazy Colonel that says screw the orders because no other leadership is around.""",emi5z3
fegu8gl,"I think the delivery scene unfolded perfectly. Mark strong’s message earlier in the movie telling him to [make sure there’s witnesses as some men are just in it for the fight] alluded to cumberbatch being that psychotic rogue commander and you felt most movies would have the corporal give a huge dramatic speech that would seem more intelligent than the colonel which always makes me roll my eyes. The corporal still got the colonel to read the letter by a simple plea but didn’t make the higher command seem like a lesser man than the messenger. That scene and theme was perfection. 

And the fuck off at the end was a brilliant gut punch. Colonel knows a completely different order can come in a couple days complicating his whole battalion while the messenger went through hell to deliver that message. Two different perspectives clashing while neither is right or wrong.",emi5z3
fdsfywc,">I thought that line really informed how desperate the military command had become.

Agreed, and as a viewer you have sympathy. At that point you’ve just watched 2 hours of horrors and you realize that the soldiers have been putting up with 3 years of it by that point.",emi5z3
fe62em9,"When he said that next week he'll get another message to say they charge at dawn, I thought it summed up the direness of the situation perfectly. He saved people in delivering his message, but the war still continues.",emi5z3
fdpxmyi,[deleted],emi5z3
fdptnko,"I assumed it would be that way, especially after he LITERALLY was ignoring him until he heard the only thing he didn’t want to hear. I loved Mark Strong’s character’s words were true in a way we weren’t expecting tho.",emi5z3
fe0ask5,"I thought it really drove the point home that even though the attack was called off, it wouldn't really make all that much of a difference in the end. All those men will likely end up dying anyway.",emi5z3
fe0gdgu,"Yeah, I think they had the second in command throw a thank you and a handshake for audience catharsis. Cause I think, in reality, those runners got no thank you, just tin with ribbons, later or posthumously.",emi5z3

fe0bf7b,That was some Full Metal Jacket shit,emi5z3
fds1irz,"That happened to me in the first 15 minutes of Blade Runner 2049 in 3D, the guy right behind me started foaming and vomiting straight up, I thought it was just some drunk idiot til I turned around. They didn't stop the movie, and the man's wife as well as his mother had to carry him out while the movie was still playing. Paramedics came, but they just came to the lobby area.",emi5z3
fdtsfz3,Was this at a Nashville showing?,emi5z3
fdwwafo,"I was there! AMC Cool Springs? I was in the front Row and we thought the same thing. We thought it was just someone goofing off until someone shouted “is there a doctor?”

feid0b0,"Real flares, but they made a miniature model of the set so they plan out the trajectory of those flares and what the shadows would do. At least, that's what I read.",emi5z3
fdqnvhd,"I didn't take it that way.  The General who gave them their orders was trying to stop an attack that was going to be a slaughter, Mark Strong's character gave Will a lift and gave him some valuable advice on getting Mackenzie to listen, and Mackenzie knew they'd eventually be given the order to attack and he wanted to get it done when he felt the enemy was at their weakest.",emi5z3

fe6id7k,Friendly reminder that antibiotics hadn't been invented yet so at best his hand needs amputated and at worst he dies of sepsis,emi5z3
fdzkorq,The body might have been clean from maggots,emi5z3
feayi9p,"That part stuck with me for a while, which is saying something given I binge listened on a cross country drive.  I can't imagine going out like that. A bullet has to be easier.

The second one was when he describes the soldiers crying out who were heavily wounded.  When a few guys try and get shot, all of a sudden the crying stops.  They go out the next day and find the guy forced his whole fist into his mouth to stop from screaming so nobody else would attempt to rescue him.",emi5z3
feepxbv,"Another interesting part of that is the first horse he came across was still pretty bloated, then 100 feet or so further up, he came across one that had been there a long while, as it’s skeleton was starting to show. Just showed that it had been a hot minute since any horse had gotten very far",emi5z3

feg6s70,"I was thinking how creepy it would be if there were bodies in that river somewhere, but then it happened. They made some bodies bloated from water which was really gross. I was sort of expecting some of them to start coming apart when Schofield started climbing ontop of them",emi5z3

fdpkwfn,"You're getting downvoted because you're dragging random cape-flick bashing into  *1917*'s review thread and that's pretty off-topic. That said, I agree with you.

fg1opr1,It’s definitely rated R in the US.,emi5z3
fdsbf80,"I may be pointing out the obvious, I think the trees were meant to symbolize safety/humanity. Every time we saw trees that had foliage or looked healthy there was a sense of calm. The scene in the grove and the soldier singing ""Wayfaring Stranger"" is one of the most blatant examples. 

By contrast, at the beginning of the film the protagonists are resting under a tree, all is well away from the front line. But as they/we travel further and further away from that first tree to the first glimpse of No Man's Land all there is upturned earth, burned trees. Complete disregard for anything living. Someone even said the line, ""Find some cover."" I was thinking ""Where?! There's nowhere to hide.""",emi5z3

fdryf0f,"I think everything you described about WWII actually applies to WWI, just add in all the history of Europe from the Napoleonic Wars, the Industrial Revolution, technological advances, Old World vs New World class conflicts, political ideologies, revenge, resentment, and countless of little things that add up to the explosion in conflict.   

People like to sum up WWI as a result of a system of alliances that activated when one nation declared war on another, but it goes far more beyond that. I literally just typed this up in the last couple of days. This was the best I could summarize why Europe went to war in July of 1914. It is not a competition of which war is more complex but WWI was never this simple conflict.   

*A combination of the different historical events. I can point to the Napoleonic Wars and the breaking down of the HRE and the unification of some German states (Confederation of the Rhine), the Crimean War, the Austro-Prussian War (puts Prussia on top over Austria), the Franco-Prussian War (the defeat of France leaves them resentful and looking for revenge; the unification of Germany), the Russo-Japanese War unsettles Russian and creates a revolution in 1905, the Balkan Wars, etc, etc, etc.*  

*The rise of Germany and it flexing its industrial muscle lead to Britain getting concerned. Simplified history points at Germany being antagonistic but there were already political concerns from Britain about the whole Balance of Power and a threat to her Naval power status that made her antagonistic to Germany. France wanted revenge on Germany for the loss in 1871 and to recuperate her lost territories. Russia and Germany were allied but when Kaiser Wilhelm II took over, he fired Bismarck who had all of these political arrangements, and let the alliance slip, which meant France came in and allied with Russia.*  

*The Kaiser can be compared to modern day Trump, in that he was an eccentric and loudmouthed buffoon. Not dangerous but created political rifts with other countries, that combined with rising Germanophobia from the Great Powers. He was the son of Victoria, Queen Victoria's daughter, who went to Prussia to marry Friedrich, but she came in looking down on Prussia and wanting to stamp out the Prussian in Wilhelm II and make him English. You get this whole traumatic childhood in which Wilhelm ends up rejecting his English background but at the same time wants to be accepted by his English family and so wants to do things such as create a Navy that competes with England so that together they can rule Europe side by side, but England sees it differently and takes it as a threat.*  

*Austria-Hungary is a decaying Empire with Emperor Josef at the helm for 60+ years. He has lost his son and heir to suicide, and the next in line is Franz Ferdinand, who married Sophie, who is not royalty and causes family drama. With the rise of nationalism, the different nations in the Empire start asking for rights like using their languages instead of being forced to use German. There is also a rise in Serbian nationalism and a longing to unite all Serbians under one nation....they have also committed regicide when they murder Alexander. When A-H annexes Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbians get enraged.*  

*For more than a century, Russia has had its eye on the Bosphorus strait, and unrestricted access from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The Ottoman Empire is dying and at times it is ripe for the taking but Britain and France intervene at times to prevent this, most notably in the Crimean War. With the expulsion of the Ottomans from the Balkans by the Serbians, a rise in Slavic nationalism brings Russia into the politics of the Balkans to assist them politically and financially.*  

*With this background, we return to Serbia, who has recently killed their king and most of the people involved are part of the Black Hand. Seeking to teach Austria-Hungary a lesson, they plan to kill their heir, Franz Ferdinand as a show of solidarity (ironically Franz Ferdinand was very tolerant of the nations in the Empire). The Black Hand has members in the government, so in a way they are one and the same.*  

**Here is a copy and paste of a comment I made months ago summarizing the events in July after the assassination occurs, there is information here that I already mentioned in the previous paragraphs.**  

It's more like A-H's meddling in the Balkans and annexation of Bosnia & Herzegovina did not sit well with the Serbians who were known regicides and wanted to unite the Serbians into one kingdom. The Russians, who wanted to get involved in the Balkans (due to Slav support and to have a foothold on the region due to the proximity to Constantinople) supported their shit and swore to protect them. While the Black Hand acted independently, their members included well known government officials, and this info was confessed by Princip and the other captured assassins. 

On the other hand you have Germany who only had A-H as their only ally due to the Germanophobia from the French and Russians, and the ties broken due to the Kaiser's eccentricities (think Trump). The Germans were also on the defensive and had spent decades planning to defend themselves from France, who were itching to have a go at them after the Franco-Prussian War, and had managed to ally with Russia. Surrounded on both sides, the Germans were too stubborn on the Schlieffen Plan, that for them to come out victorious in a war against France and Russia, they had no choice but to knock out France first via Belgium because their shared border was correctly strongly fortified, and then turn their attention to Russia. This was a plan that was to prevent the minimum German casualties.

Anyway, the A-H had the intention to go to war but needed German support in case Russia got involved. They hid the full details and made it seem as though they were just gonna send troops to capture the terrorist group, but not as an invasion. The Kaiser, confident that it wasn't anything big agreed to support A-H. So when the ultimatum was issued, all of a sudden, the Kaiser and Germany panic as they realized what the true intention of A-H was. They notice that Russia had begun mobilizing and tell them to stand down cause they don't want to begin mobilizing (for the Germans, due to the exactness of the Schlieffen Plan, mobilizing does not mean only getting the troops ready, but actually getting the troops ready and invade Belgium). They ask France to stand down, but they refuse. They ask Britain to pledge neutrality, but due to miscommunication, they get a 'yes' but that ends up as a 'no' if they invade a neutral country. Russia's large army needs to mobilize early even if it doesn't end with them fighting, but more as a precaution, but the Germans, who are freaking out at this point think it means that the Russians are gonna invade them, and thus start mobilizing their army and a few days later invade Belgium.  

Franz Ferdinand was not popular because of his cold and authoritarian persona that he emanated. He wasn't an authoritarian though, but that still didn't stop the people from assuming. Also, he was warned against going to Sarajevo and had survived an attempted assassination earlier that morning, yet he still persisted in continuing the tour of the city. When he was killed and news broke out of the perpetrators, people who had heard of the news were sympathetic to A-H and even supported armed intervention in a small scale, but it was a non-event in general (England was involved in an issue with Ireland, the French had a major political scandal/drama with the wife of a politician killing someone, etc.).

A-H escalated the tensions by not revealing publicly that they meant to teach Serbia a lesson once and for all by invading them in armed conflict, and took by surprise the Great Powers when they issued out their ultimatum. Like I posted above, their ally, Germany were willing to support a minor armed conflict to capture the schemers, not a full scale invasion, and thus gave A-H their full blessing to do whatever they wanted, thinking it would amount to nothing. As mentioned, the assassination was not really a big event as many make it out to be, but it did set in motion the machinery of war, and once it got started, it was impossible to turn back.  

The more detailed story of the July Crisis is more intense and it would be great if they made a movie out of it, as those last two weeks are a crazy back and forth between the governments to prevent the war. Check out *The Sleepwalkers by Christopher Clark*, *the Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman*, and *George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm by Miranda Carter* for a look at these events as a starting point. Dan Carlin left out the insane drama of this event in his podcast.",emi5z3

fdpnkqm,"Bleh, the part when he temporarily put his hand into a dead body by accident.",emi5z3
fdqp9nk,"So just to play devil’s advocate here, I think the point is that essentially making any movie out of war in a sense is already making a “spectacle” out of it. 

Sure the actual content of the scene is horrific and the intention is likely to show it as such but filming it and presenting it in away to incite a sense of thrill and horror for the audience’s “enjoyment/entertainment” (in the same way we “enjoy” the thrill of a rollercoaster or seeing violence on screen in general) is in some ways making a spectacle out of it even if that’s not necessarily the intention. 

Of course, it’s not to the degree that other films have stylistic and gratuitous violence for the sake of cool and fun actions scenes, but the logic is similar in that making a film out of it can be seen as using the war and its horrors as a vehicle for making “entertainment.”

A similar example would be how 13 Reasons Why is often accused of glorifying suicide. Now I think what trips people up is the word “glorifying” as it suggests that the content is in someway portraying suicide in a positive light (which 13 Reasons why could also be accused of) which again is likely not the intent of the creators. They showed the suicide scene to really drive home the horrors of it as well as accurately portray it. But again in some sense, the act of merely showing it is bringing attention to it and it seems like studies have shown that merely showing suicide on screen like that is enough to trigger those on the brink to attempt it themselves. 

All this is to say that I somewhat understand that perspective and criticism. As for violence in particular, I think studies have shown that violent films and games do not necessarily incite more violence so its not necessarily the same scenario as the suicide example. But still I think it’s fair and their right to criticize the constant portrayal of violence and the horrors of war on the big screen for “entertainment”, even if I or most don’t feel that way.",emi5z3

Yeah, did they even have tetanus shots back then? I kept thinking that's going to get infected. Especially after he shoved his hand through that dead German's stomach.

EDIT: According to Wikipedia, the Tetanus antiserum was developed in 1890, but the tetanus toxoid vaccine wasn't developed until 1924, and a more effective adsorbed version of the vaccine was created in 1938 and came into common use to prevent tetanus for soldiers in World War II.",emi5z3
fdpsde5,Critics often feel with war films if you do not actively feel terrible while watching or the scene isn’t truly artistic rather than personal for the character it’s entertainment. However I have not red anything but positive reviews.,emi5z3
fdwgmbz,Yes seriously. And every bit of dialogue was just completely bleak and hopeless. Showing how many people died to fight over a couple mile area of fields. Benjamin Cumberbatch at the end talking about how next week they’ll get orders to attack. Showing that even our hero’s journey however brave likely was unimportant in the grand scheme as they’re going to keep dying and fighting for basically nothing. Also I loved the tone of this movie. So different than most war movies which are very machismo and have heroic tones. This felt much closer to a horror movie and I loved how banal a lot of the violence was. Felt much more grounded and true to warfare which I think even hammered home even more how awful war is.,emi5z3
feov9aa,"I'm a bit late in replying to this, having only just seen it, but any critic upset about the notion of making this war a spectacle needs to study the war itself a bit more.

Overall I thought the film was a wonderful treatise on storytelling and art, and how it can use war to be engaging but the art is most valuable, most lasting . The way the camera almost only shows the lead characters, not what they’re seeing, it’s like the movie is saying this is the storyteller, he goes through hell in war and comes out the other side genuflecting for art, for creation, not destruction.",emi5z3

Understandably pilots in WW1 were all aristocrats, from well off families.

That being said, this war was like no other, there wasn't a right or a wrong way of acting, when people got scared they undoubtedly freaked out. He may never have even seen a British solider in front of him before as he was a pilot.

fijctlb,"I appreciate it. I came out of the film with the same buzz as I would with any other film I enjoyed, but it wasn’t until I got home and had some time to myself that it started to have me think about everything Will went through in a matter of hours, and for what? Hundreds of thousands of men had to fight every day for their, and their brothers’, lives because of a political conflict between a few men with the power to orchestrate attacks with their entire army. It’s impossible to remember every soldier, and again highlights the insignificance of one man, but it was thanks to those individual men and their courageous acts that won the war. My knowledge of WWI is far less than my knowledge of WWII, but it made me want to learn about some of those stories and let their legacy live on through another mind. This movie will stick with me for a while too. Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins and the rest of the cast and crew have provided some wonderful, inspirational Cinema.",emi5z3
fit73xb,"Thank you. After some added thought and a couple of Sam Mendes interviews, the choice to use lesser-ranked soldiers and relatively unknown actors for these roles was a perfect decision and highlights my point on the importance of individual unimportance.

fdxfoni,"I answered this to someone else a little more in depth in this comment thread but the bottom line is for me when I get past an 8 it's just all personal preference to me. War movies aren't my favorite so it wouldn't feel right to call it my favorite movie of the year, if that makes sense.

fdtn3sz,"I sure do have a letterboxd, I don't do reviews on there but I update all the movies I've seen on there every once in a while. Same name as my Reddit account, literaryboner. 

To answer your question, basically anything above an 8 for me comes down to personal taste. A movie can be brilliant in every way possible but if it's not my cup of tea I might give it an 8 even if I have no real issues with it. In the same vein, there might be movies I do have a few issues with but if it spoke to me or I feel like it was made just for me I might give that an 8 as well. 

In this case, war movies just aren't my favorite, so I'd be lying to myself to call this my favorite movie of the year. It's definitely up there on technical achievements alone, but in general I find war movies to share a lot of the same themes so they rarely surprise me in the writing area. My main criticism of 1917 would be that sometimes I felt like the one-shot style restricted it, even though the style worked for this movie it's a very difficult thing to do and not totally necessary other than to say that they did it. So there are little moments here and there where maybe some editing could have strengthened it, but overall it's such a small complaint it doesn't really affect my score. 

Hope this helps! Bottom line is I loved the movie but even my favorite movies this year I didn't give 10s to, being Rocketman and Little Women. A 10 is pretty rare for me, I think the last movie I honestly felt was perfect and right up my alley was Paddington 2, hence the flair.",emi5z3

When he climbs out of that river and ends up in an almost dream-like surreal scene, seemed to be referring to Dante's preordained leaving of Inferno. What they go through seem to be a sequence of circles after circles of hell, and even the ending is not very clear-cut happy ending.

It is beyond me how some said his score is not subtle - there are only 2 key moments that demanded major orchestral powers to be unleashed, but the real appreciation of how subtle many of his elements are comes when one listens to the soundtrack album. I only realised then, and had to watch again and again, in how many places Newman is present with translucent sonic textures and tiny subdued musical motifs, that we barely notice - but he is ""in the air"" just to give a very subtle atmosphere.

On the one picture it’s written “come back to us.” A theme of the movie was returning home. We don’t know if he ever does. That was just one day of this guys life and it was absolute hell. For all we know that hand did get infected and he does die. It added to the tenseness of the whole film. Will he make it or get killed, will he get their in time, will he get captured, Will his hand become an issue later on in the story? As far as his hand, it simply didn’t  become an issue. I know that’s a lazy answer but it just didn’t. It was only there to showcase possible injuries and how disgusting the actual battlefield was. I somewhat agree though that they he should have acknowledged it in some way later on in the story. 

The whole grenade thing is skewed because of our perspective. It’s 2020 and pretty much every person in the world knows what a hand grenade is and pretty much know how to use one and also what it’s used for. Hand grenades at the time we’re only like 2 years old and not used in the same way conventional grenades are used. They were used to break up large numbers of charging infantry. My dad said “why didn’t he just use the grenade to kill the sniper in the window.” Because using one grenade on one solider to clear out a building was a completely foreign concept because of how new the tech was and how wars were fought. CQC is a relatively new way to fight in the grand scheme of history. Think about it this way: a solider who isn’t even really a solider, just someone who gets drafted and has to fight, has maybe 1 month tops of training before getting thrown into war, is now given an item that is pretty much brand spanking new and not something that would have normally been handed out. The only reason they were even given the grenades is because of their mission, otherwise they didn’t even have any other grenades. Also, they were given a bunch of supplies that never were shown being used. They give them ammo yet you never see any character fully load their gun. They chamber new rounds but as far as reloading I don’t believe we ever see our characters do this. 

The witness thing was absolutely used but in a more subtle way. Yea he didn’t have to go out and find people to witness it because he was in the commanders tent with other high ranking offices. It’s more of the will he won’t he scenario. Mark Strong says “some men just want the fight,” coupled with the statement about witness implies that the commander was know to go against orders. So our hero has this harrowing journey full of death and despair, and he’s also physically and mentally exhausted. Now he finally gets there and there’s a moment when the commander was reading the letter that I thought for sure he was going to rip up the orders and have the main character escorted out or something. It added to the tenseness because our hero has been through hell and your so happy he finally makes it, but from what we know of the commander, through the other characters, there was a 50/50 chance that he was going to just go ahead with the assault anyway.",emi5z3

Then you see the bodies at the weir and realise that these Germans were probably supposed to destroy the bridge, and they did, and then went a little further. Them being more busy looting, killing and burning is why they don't notice that their lookout (the ""sniper"") is killed, and later fail to properly search for the British soldier in their midst.",emi5z3

And it was perfect. 

Another thing was the blackout cut when he gets shot. I wanted to check my watch and see what time that happened at, I had a feeling it was and would be very close to the exact middle of the story.

Amazing. This movie was amazing.

Third thing, I avoided everything possible about this movie going in, so I genuinely didnt know the Deaken filmed it.  When I saw his name I sorta threw my hands up in the air and said ""well yeah, who else""

Like right after the tree shot Schofield is talking to Blake about his letter from home and at the end he is talking to a Blake's brother about a letter before going to rest by a tree. Or Schofield's crossing the river under sniper fire to get into the village and having to survive it in a different way as he escaped. A German killed Schofield's friend while his attention is elsewhere,  but later he kills a German whose friend is distracted. The flare that signified triumph in the first half became a danger in the French town at night, etc.",emi5z3

fgogpzl,"I think it was a conscious decision for the film to utilize the ""one-shot"" trick not just for exhibition purposes, but to really drive the point home that, in the situation of war, **time is of the essence**.

As u/Ouroboros000 already pointed out, warfare isn't that much of an adventure. A lot can happen in a span of a few hours then, and I want to believe that it was Sam Mendes' vision to depict what as little as *119 minutes* of this horrendous experience can do to a human being.

It's a film that really capitalizes in one of its constants: of it being constrained by a time limit.",emi5z3
fgnz9qi,"Movies are not made in a vacuum, I think there is a statement in this movies in context of all those that glorify war as a great adventure. I think the point of this movie is the incredible stress of being in a life and death situation (and not only your own but also others) and most importantly the incredible psychic toll it takes on the participants. There's also the element that though these guys commit tremendous acts of bravery - they are just cogs in a wheel and get very little credit for it - the idea that heroism is an internal thing and not necessarily seeking glory or credit for a heroic act.",emi5z3
fib2e0m,"Oh yeah for sure there were plenty of sequences that really benefitted from being long takes. The one that sticks out to me is Blake's death scene, where you can see him slowly bleeding out. That was really effective. Crossing the no man's land was great too.

But overall, there were a lot of really bland sequences where not much was going on and those could have used some cutting. It would have also made the issue of time passage and distance more believable. 

And as I mentioned there were times where the camera had to stay too close and it just detracted from the experience. Like, the characters were looking at something and due to the limitations of the camera movement they couldn't show properly what it was. I don't think a few establishing shots and more wides would have made the movie any less immersive than it is.

Finally, the hidden cuts were just too distracting for me. There is only so many times you can do tree swipe cuts and zooming in on rocks before it gets so obvious.

Long shots are an incredibly powerful tool in the right hands, Cuaron and Lubezki are the masters of this. I don't think they worked as well in this film as in movies like Children of Men.",emi5z3

It's extremely rare that I see a trailer afterwards and say to myself that it wouldn't have spoiled anything for me because almost every single one does. A couple exceptions that come to mind are the Deadpool 2 teaser and how Prometheus made these character mini-stories ahead of release to give them a backstory. That pissed me off because I ended up watching a movie and seeing these characters all die with no emotional attachment. Then I found out I was supposed to watch those little trailers first. Oh well.

Even trailers when people say it doesn't really spoil anything, it does for me. I spend the whole movie thinking about some upcoming scene and how it ties in to where I'm currently in the movie.

I was correct beat for beat which shows that the marketing was garbage and that the story was hollow.

Sure, your typical trailer will spoil some big moments or a few plot points but in this case, it laid out the entire story from the beginning to the end. 1917's advertisement spoiled the entirety of the film. Most trailers try to hide at least a couple important moments.",emi5z3

What is true is the engagement distance of WW1 and even WW2 was believed to be 1000m. It's kind of crazy that they believed that using nothing but iron sights you would have troops engaging at almost half a mile away.

The Germans in WW2 were the first to realize most engagements were happening much closer than their proposed 1000m so they developed a 8mm Kurz which was the first ""intermediate cartridge"" (As in longer range/more energy than a sub machine gun but still shorter range/less energy than the common rifle rounds at the time) which is something NATO eventually adopted with the 5.56mm everyone uses today.",emi5z3

And I guess we could assume from some of his dialogue that he might be a coward, but again, the movie shows us something completely else.

fieak4m,"Homing pigeons were used extensively in WWI. Their skill is that they fly back to their home though, so you couldn't just send a pigeon to a new location like a programmed drone. If soldiers on the front line brought homing pigeons *with* them to Point B, they could send them *back* to Point A with messages, but Point A couldn't send a message to the front line.

(Human) runners were still vital, especially if lines were cut or electronic communication was likely to be intercepted, and in fact human dispatches sometimes had to [deliver homing pigeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despatch_rider) anyway.

It's also worth pointing out that when sending messages from trench to trench on the front lines, a pigeon was likely to be shot down. And even if the lines hadn't been cut (they had) and carrier pigeons were a possibility (they weren't), this message was too important and too time-sensitive to just send out a message and hope it got into the right hands and in good time. Tom Blake was sent because it was believed he had the greatest motivation to ensure the message arrived, his brother's life being at risk if the battle went ahead.

1917, again while good, is simply (to me), just another well-made war movie. It's not of the same caliber as, for example, Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now, Or WW2 classics like The Bridge on the River Kwai and Saving Private Ryan, or the WW1 masterpiece Paths of Glory. Or in terms of non-English war films, Das Boot or Come and See (both WW2 movies from the German side and the Eastern Front (Russian) side. It simply doesn't hold a candle to those films.

ff6c6i3,"Indeed, all of those things happened, Blake's death was touching ""Am I dying?"" and the scene when Schofield was in the truck afterwards was an effective contrast.  All of these scenes came across, to me, as about as well acted and staged as they possibly could be within the constraints of the filmakers strategy.  But...well, here is   
stab at  how it felt to watch emotional scenes in this movie: built into my moment-to-moment viewing of the film was a constant sense that nothing could actually get that bad.  Scofield's 'plot armor' was particularly explicit, because since I knew that the camera would follow him until the end of the film, he couldn't possibly die.  As the negative critics quoted above, the camera itself felt like a character, and it neutered and watered down emotional moments because it constrained them.  In emotional scenes of mental breakdown in The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Cold Mountain, the filmakers depict extended emotional breakdowns that probably took place over hours or even days, and there's an open-endedness to it, a sense that the filmaking vocabulary is entirely in the service of a 'real' story.  By real I mean that my disbelief is suspended, whereas here, this is how it felt: 

so Blake dies from a lower abdomen stab wound in about 2 minutes (instead of 10 or 20, which would seem more typical for that type of wound)?  So the Captain is weeping in the trench near the end, and Blake's brothers' grief at the end, are touching, but also don't actually derail Schofield much; he moves onto his next thing after a brief interaction; why?  The stunning flare cinematography sequence, and his bit in the river, and his interaction with the woman and the baby, all take about  5 minutes each...why?

The answer to each of these question is the same: because it is a continual shot, and therefore nothing can take that long.  The aggravation of, in an urgent mission, getting pinned down for 3 hours isn't even theoretically possible, within this fiction, because the style of the fiction announces that at the beginning; the possibility of getting sidelined for 20 minutes by an insane soldier or civilian isn't possible for the same reason.  Nothing that slows Scofield down too much could happen, or else the movie couldn't happen.  Everything that DOES happen is plausible, sure.  Schofield is in a hurry, after all.  But the impossibility that any hurdle might take more than a few minutes to solve was always there for me; somehow, I could feel the gears of the screenplay grinding away to make the movie work as well as it could.",emi5z3
ff4k5k7,"I agree as well. I liked this movie but there are a few scenes that seem less than. In the hands of a better director I think this would have been a better movie.

ff6e5ia,"I hung out with my teenage nephews last night, and we talked a lot about 1917, which they said that they loved.  At least 90% of the conversation was about the cinematography and what he had read about it.  I asked how he felt about the movie, and he just said, ""war is hell; I mean, I get it.""  Between about the age of 15 and 25, I devoured graphic content about war.  I remember after I watched Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy, Saving Private Ryan, read The Killer Angels, saw and read Black Hawk Down, etc.  I always felt something pretty heavy afterwards, had a lot fo say.  Hearing my nephews comment, and the continual pivots into discussing how 1917 ""pulled it off,"" I thought of all the deep conversations I've had about the themes, ideas, character arcs, etc. of some of the works I listed above.  A common theme among the negative reviews of this film as well is that it has nothing to say about war other than ""war is hell.""  That was Dargis' take on it overall: a virtuoso simulation of war, but a pretty shallow film.

Just screaming, loudly, ""war is hell"" is certainly a worthy thing to do, I suppose.  But I think that, 100 years from now, I think that Stone's Vietnam trilogy will still be seen as a fascinating artistic document of how one vet-turned-filmaker tried to frame his experience, how his films formed a zeitgeist around a certain take on the war.  Same with, even though it doesn't have same 'but he was there' topicality, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.  In discussing popular perceptions of what WWII *meant,* those films are indispensable.  Books have been written about the morality, politics, and psychology of those films.

I think that, 100 years from now, 1917 will mostly be notable for its cinematography.              I suspect Dunkirk will mostly be notable for it's timeline/editing technique.  I got more into Dunkirk, but was struck that it's basically a suspense thriller at heart, more than a movie about WWII.",emi5z3
fhrldkr,"Couldn't have said it better myself. Also, the way the movie was over-scored, particularly concerning the placement of music in certain moments, only served to squander the immersiveness imo",emi5z3
fdqmy3k,"Ha, I noted the similarities as well and I would definitely rate Dunkirk as the better film. But hey, different strokes for different folks!

Actually, and perhaps strangely, I also found myself comparing it to the new Malick picture A Hidden Life, and finding the two movies to be each others counterparts. They both show the resilience of one man in the face of overwhelming odds, but while 1917 tries to eliminate editing completely, A Hidden Life almost overedits: the entire movie has hundreds of cuts, the scenes are rather short (I think none cross the 10-minute mark and most are under 5 minutes) and usually jump to a different location with every other scene. While 1917 stays in the moment the entire time, A Hidden Life is more distant, allowing for shots of the countryside and pensive voice-overs. Even in their respective climax they are opposites: 1917 ramps up the tension while A Hidden Life makes it abundantly clear, almost in the first of its three hour runtime, how the story is going to end.

My reaction to both, as you might imagine, was also quite different. During A Hidden Life, I just couldn't look away. In fact, I edged closer to the screen as it went on. I wept during a few scenes. While watching 1917 I felt distant. Although it was clearly made by top craftsmen, I couldn't warm to it.

I don't disagree that those shots weren't beautifully filmed. That type of shooting just doesn't work for me in that type of film. I still felt like the scope was too small. I can think of maybe three of four shots that I actually felt like I knew what was going on. Going for a narrow focus like that works for a movie like Birdman that is just about the characters. I think a war movie is slightly more than just characters and needs the shots to show the audience the scope of what is happening.

""Subverting expectations"" is a pretty dangerous phrase after the Game of Thrones finale. I feel like it is more of an excuse for inconsistent storytellings than serving any real narrative purpose.

At the ending of the movie, with the dedication to his relative, it made me think it was just a bunch of separate stories cobbled together into one. Sure it could be a commentary on the randomness and futility of war, but for some reason that isn't what I am left thinking about after the movie.

fegl5sd,"See I like discussion. It's discouraging to have a movie sub and people just not having discussions but just saying ""I clapped the end. Best movie ever!""

And I can agree with that. I did take into account he killed people, but it was always in retaliation and therefore necessity. He killed the pilot because he stabbed his buddy Blake and was going to shoot him (to be fair Blake stopped him on this one). He killed the guy in the tower because he shot first and it was necessary for his survival. He is the one we see kill the most people because it's the only character we follow the entirety of the movie. Overall, that one was not a big concern, but him just kind of putting himself in danger by walking toward the German in the city and then not killing the drunk Germans who all ended up shooting back at him felt a bit much.

Not a movie breakers, I still really liked the film. It was just somethings that fell flat to me.",emi5z3

fefnpdi,"I mean, that explains the scene and art style. However doesn’t address any of the issues I stated. The second half was just forced. The main character conveniently just stumbles to where he needs to go. For someone with a head injury and not keeping direction, he easily ends up where he needs to go. And everyones purpose in the story just become self serving to the main character.

Strange soldier ends up in the woods and no one is worried he might be an enemy? Ok. He’s not allowed to see Commander McKenzie? Oh well go on right ahead, he’s right around the corner.

It just didn’t pace well.",emi5z3

He hit his head so hard that he was knocked out for hours and bleeding from the head, so we have to remember this is no longer a person who is thinking straight. Him running after that with the flares behind him and being shot at was stunning, and the music became much more grand and almost whimsical in that moment which really brought home that kind of daze he would have been after waking up like that.",emi5z3

fei5yt0,"> Yea well except for the fact that the scene in which he runs ""through"" the charge. Had no green screen and was entirely made with practical effects and extras. 

For real? Wow, I was sure that was green screen. Maybe something done in post production but there was definitely something noticeably off about the character's interaction with his background in this scene. Perhaps increasing exposure of the character, if it aint the green screen.

> And also i don't know if you've ever shot a rifle before. But firing at a moving target who doesn't want to be hit. In complete darknesss. While running yourself. With a bolt action rifle.. Is pretty fucking difficult. So it was completely realistic they didn't hit him.

It wasn't complete darkness, it was pretty well illuminated, the moving target that didn't want to be hit was running in a straight line away from his pursuer who didn't need to be running himself, could have stopped, steading himself and lined up a nice easy kill.

Although I concede I've never fired a rifle or been in a war.

The other scene where he shoots the German from the low ground, after crossing the broken bridge, when the German spots him first, is already encamped in a nice position, yet repeatedly misses and is then shot by our protagonist through a window from the low ground.

fgdvvfz,"**An obvious cut is when the camera literally cuts to a different perspective.**

You are right to criticise me for my wording here. The cuts were not obvious in a way that you could totally tell when there was a cut. I meant to say that the movie did not give me the illusion it was shot in one, two or even three takes and that I could spot many of the cuts that were made. For example after the explosion, after jumping from the bridge and various scenes when the view from the main character was blocked.

**Also the plot armor point is laughably awful too. Surely killing them  both 30 minutes into it is FAR more believable. Man the movie would be  just AWESOME if they both died and it was all just a weak ass failed  mission. At some point you have to accept what a story is and stop  trying so hard to dislike it.**

If you can accept what happened in the movie it is totally fine to me- most people who saw the movie liked it. I don't really get what you mean by ""...the movie would be awesome if they both died..."" but anyway, I personally felt like the movie focused way too much on achieving technical greatness for the cost of telling a good story and character development and yeah, I could not take it seriously how many dangerous situations he survived unharmed.

The technical aspect was great but it wasn't as in my face as it would be as if I watched it in IMAX or Dolby so the film really had to ride on its storytelling to win me over.

In addition, the scene plays out strangely where she doesn’t seem to know how to speak English either yet understands everything he says.

Hanging out with the lady and the baby a little too long, but I guess the point there was to have him sitting around until he heard the bells.

And lastly him arriving upon the camp and sitting down to listen to a guy sing.

They feel like poetic quiet moments, and these scenes would probably work well on their own, but they undermine the urgency.

I feel like comparing the second half of this movie with what Leo DiCaprio did in the second half of The Remnant, where he looked extremely roughed up and crawling and doing gritty things to survive. The plot of The Remnant doesn't really have a time factor in it, but the way we see Leo carry himself through the muck, I always felt like he moved with a personal sense of urgency (fueled entirely on revenge).",emi5z3

Also the sniper was the worst shot in history, some guy slowly going across a bridge a short distance away. The scene in the ruins when that guy noticed him across the square and ran to within twenty feet and missed him.

Then, when Schofield is hiding in the house with the French woman and the baby, she tells him that it's actually early morning and warns him that it will be getting light, so Schofield must have woken up in early morning just before it started turning light.

fdu7u4h,But being passed out wouldn’t account for 6 hours of actual travel. That would just be an additional 6 hours of lying on the floor. And the time in the trucks was only maybe 5 minutes which wouldn’t be that much of a travel time saved.,emi5z3
fdudtkq,"Yeah I’ve been combing the comments here for some sort of explanation and the only possible answers I’ve come across so far are:

-	the guy who estimated 8 hours was wrong and didn’t actually know what he was talking about

-	the estimate was based on the *danger* of the route, not the distance

-	it’s somehow “implied” that more time passed than was shown during the truck ride and river scenes (which doesn’t make any sense)

-	and my own reasoning that maybe the river rapids ride was some sort of MASSIVE shortcut since he did jump off a bridge and all, maybe the safe walking route would have taken much longer

So I don’t think there’s really any actual explanation of it, it’s likely just movie magic. I wish they hadn’t mentioned the 8 hour estimate at all in that dialogue so that there wouldn’t be this one tiny inconsistency nibbling on my brain in an otherwise perfect movie",emi5z3

fdx018q,"What they could have done is >!spin the camera from him around the truck doing a 360 back to him. They could then have added in the bottom corner of the screen a later time to signify the time jump. You would still keep the ""one take"" nature of the film while allowing for a better flow of time. Same could have been done while he was in the water or them walking through the german back lines,etc. In those scenarios when it pans back the character would have to be in a different ""location"" to have signified movement. Or maybe have it pan to the sky and we watch the sun and clouds move at an accelerated pace before it pans back down to the character. You might not have wanted to do it excessively but in the end it needed it to feel like time was properly flowing. I think this film style would be best suited for a real-time plot!<",emi5z3

fdrpves,"I was actually very disappointed by Jarhead and that was based off one of my favourite books. It focused way too much on the ""War is boring"" aspect when that was a minor thing off the book and one of the least thematically interesting things. 

1917 felt as if you are navigating a battlefield, and that itself made it interesting. The rapid changes (though too rapid at the end) in No Man's Land and the Hell/Purgatoryscape was frankly fantastic. The characters didn't need much psychology as the point was that they were just men (and civilians) stuck in that situation doing their best to continue existing. I am ok with that.

When I was watching it happen it was like watching a horror movie where the main characters think the killer is out for the count because they swung a baseball bat at his head. You know he’s gonna get back up for one last attempt.

It sounds like a silly comparison because something like this may specifically be based on actual events, but I don’t think the movie conveyed their reasoning well enough as to why they helped him. It’s probably why a lot of people are asking this question. I loved the movie but that scene baffled me a little.

fewriay,"Unfortunately, nothing really stood out for me. It doesn't mean it didn't have good moments, but just nothing memorable... I mean, I finished the movie, I was entertained overall. I didn't fall asleep or want to walk out of the theatre or anything like that.

I came in with very heavy expectations that this was going to be an 11/10 kind of movie. So landing a 6 is a failure to me. But I will respect 1917 as a movie that was creative and tried to pull off something that unfortunately just didn't work for me. I can see the difference between a ""good"" movie that wasn't my style vs a ""bad"" movie that was a half-assed cash grab that never should have been released in the first place. So I reserve those movies for the 3/10's.

If I came off as ripping this movie into shreds... well, not quite. It just simply wasn't a ""Saving Private Ryan"" caliber to me (not even close), which is what I was expecting, so yes, I was a bit emotional in my review at how disappointed I was.

fekk2rl,"The atmosphere of WWI was very different from any other world conflict to come after. Most of the combatants fought for the idea of being a hero or for the broad idea of their country, not necessarily to destroy the germans. It was treated more like a game. And a lot of the time, the combatants treated each other with respect in moments where it was seen they didn't HAVE to kill each other. It's why so many POW's accounts have stated they were treated very well by their captors. Airmen were among the more respected typically, especially since they were seen as ""inactive"" when not in a working aircraft. 

Scholfield wanted to put him out of his misery. Blake, being stated as the less experienced of the two, probably didn't want anyone to die if he could help it.

fen031d,">I mean, he said that after almost literally dying in a mine explosion. That seems like the moment you would say something like that

I don't think so. Especially not after his friend had just saved his life. If they had volunteered to do this mission, and he asked ""why did we sign up for this"" then it would have felt better to me. Instead it came across as being very harsh on his friend.

I think it would have felt less forced if it came much later in the movie. The only real obstacle they had encountered on their journey thus far had been a single trip mine. It didn't feel earned to me in the way you describe. Not to mention that the person he is talking to just saved his life. I'm not sure it was an appropriate time to say that.

>I mean he was pretty much at his lowest at that moment, completely exhausted, broke down crying just before reaching them and the scene felt surreal for the audience, must have been even worse for him. He came to his senses when they started talking to him and he snapped back to reality and to his mission pretty quickly after that

fqeubr9,"It depicts the Germans in such a way which makes them seem morally repugnant. At every turn, the German is the first to start firing at the British soldier. Every time the British solder tries trusting the enemy - be it when they try to save the dogfighter, or when he sees the enemy soldier walking toward him at Écoust-Saint-Mein, or when he tries to keep the German soldier quiet from his drunk comrade in the same town.. each time the German is shown to have zero sense of self-preservation and is willing to throw their life away in order to kill the enemy. This isn't what WWI was like. It was boys from villages sent to drown in mud, or die from disease, or be mowed down by machine guns over a hundred yards of bodies. It was a war of nationalism and imperialism, and unlike WWII it did not have a clear good side and bad side.

The best action scene in this film which was maybe the scene of the Charge is like comparable to the stretcher scene in Dunkirk which isn’t even an action scene. It was mostly annum adventure film of two coprpodals trying to deliver a message. It just didn’t highlight the horrors of WW1 fmo. Yes WW1 was not action packed like WW1 but it had the modern chivalry type of feel with the charges of trench warfare. In general WW1 was known for trench warfare. I felt this film totally wasted it to just follow a plot we have seen at times. I know film was shown like this in the trailer but I wish they just one decent action sequence that would’ve showed the viewers what WW1 was like. I didn’t even like they shall grow old that much but it showed what WW1 was like. The thing is holdnwar films a bit higher cause my favorite shows and films like Band of brothers, SPR, and even Dunkirk hold a realism and respect to history fmo that makes war films great. 

  I see people compare this film to Dunkirk, and Dunkirk wasn’t perfect fmo but it lived up to telling a war event with as much real sims and respect to the tension of war.

War sucks but as a moviegoer and watcher I want to see with some sort of action or violence that makes you understand that. I feel like they wasted the trench warfare aspect that we have never seen in mainstream movies at all and just made it a movie I can see in any plot.

The milk at the farm? Zero relevance. Thought that was supposed to show someone lived there, but nothing. Who milked it? Certainly not the Germans

The letter was bone dry when he took it from inside his jacket after he'd been submerged in water for a long time. Those uniforms aren't that well insulated 

I personally find it difficult to believe that after his exhausting trip that he could overpower two well rested body guards to get to McKenzie 

And when he got off the trucks and got sniped at like 60 seconds later, why didn't the convoy he was with do anything?

femi2og,"In Ernst Jünger’s book, Storm of Steel, he talks about how thousands of corpses were left behind in each battle. Not just because of the dangers of No Man’s Land, but also the intensity of the shelling. This movie didn’t really capture how horrific the artillery shelling was- literally burying men and corpses under thousands of pounds of earth. He talked about how body parts and corpses would be part of the earthworks within craters/shell holes. When a battlefield had been revisited and “reactivated”, he even found body remains of soldiers from the previous time a battle took place there years before.

Dan Carlin says the ground in many battle spots late in the war was like a marshmallow. It was basically softer dirt because of the constant bombardment, muddy from rain and no vegetation, and then squishy because of all the bodies that have been piling up for YEARS.  

The Movie made a big deal about 1600 men running into a trap (which is a lot to think about) but in WW1 1500-2000 casualties was just a normal day.  The battle of the Somme had a casualty rate on the allie side of over 5000 men per day for 5.5 months.   and that was just 1 battle.",emi5z3

febp22i,"That doesn’t really have much to do with the scenes I’m talking about. Yes in a firefight most fire misses its target or is just shot to suppress. That’s much different than a soldier aiming at a guy 15 feet away and whiffing repeatedly. The worst offenders were:

1.	The guy missing him on the bridge from a perfect vantage point at short range.
2.	The guy weirdly sprinting at him when the building was burning and firing from the hip, and then repeatedly missing him when he was a few feet in front of him in a corridor.
3.	The Germans all missing him at the last part of the burning village escape.
4.	Him not dying pretty much right away while he slowly walked in no mans land before the charge.

What you’re describing is the case because people take a lot of shots without even really seeing their target in the first place, or are firing to suppress. Not because these people aren’t trained marksmen who can take down easy targets.",emi5z3

Except that this is missing from WW1 when it came to the reasons that the countries went to war with each other. I'd recommend reading just the amount of insanity that went in the Interbellum Period.

We have got the Soviet Union both with the intentions of getting back the regions lost after WW1 (like the Baltics, Finland, parts of Poland, Belarus and Ukraine) and spread communism, as territorial demarcations remain unclear. We have Italy crumbling to extremism as communists and fascists fight with the fascists winning. We have Poland behaving with the same kindness and pacifism the Soviet Union showed to it, also invading Czechia during the German Invasion of Czechoslovakia and annexing a region to protect its Polish minority. We have an unsatisfied USSR that failed to reclaim its former territories back from the '34 war. We have Germany trying to fulfill its dreams of expanding East and rid itself of the Slavs. We have the mess in the Balkans as Italy desires Fuime and other regions from Yugoslavia as it has an Italian minority which would become a major rallying call for Italy alongside the desire to annex Malta. We have multiple alliances and potential alliances go by and disappear in a few years as no one is distrusting each other because of ideology and wars before the fighters are clear. 

We've got the ideological considerations that meant that the Slovak State and Hungary, despite fighting a war against each other, allied together with Germany and that relationship includes Romania and Hungary. Romania would also join the war to fight against communism and attempt to conquer Ukrainian territories as Ukraine descends into slaughter and the Bandera faction slaughters Poles, fights with communists and then everyone. 

What makes WW2 is that it is much easier to find a culprit than it is with WW1, that being Germany and its eastward expansions (STALIN DIDN'T WANT TO ATTACK ADVANCING GERMAN FORCES TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE PEACE). The way WW2 played out is a bigger hellhole than WW1, especially on the Eastern Front.",emi5z3

fet4yo6,"Sorry to reply 8 days later but I've just seen the film. I think that there is a valid concern around turning war into entertainment but that needs to be balanced by the power of film to show people the horrors of war in such a visceral and emotional way. Very few other artistic mediums are able to immerse the subject in a narrative the way that film can, and when film explores war in the way that 1917 does it can leave a lasting impact on the audience who will come out with an understanding of war that is deeper and more real than anything that could be gained through textbooks or encyclopedias.

In a sense, a good film allows you to ""live"" the experience, and given that we can't go back in time and experience the hell that was the First World War ourselves, film is one of the only ways we will be able to understand how disgustingly vile and heartbreaking the war really was.

I think *1917* comes about as close as you can get to a film that portrays war as harrowing, senseless, and arbitrary. I love that the film takes away the lead hero's gun, makes him helpless during a crucial death scene, and makes the overall mission about *preventing* a battle.",emi5z3

The scene with the baby. The death scene - holding your dying friend isn't emotional??? Jesus there's some really dumb fucking people in the world.

I just kind of found myself almost distracted at points because of it, and maybe almost pulled me out of it a bit.

ff4n1tn,">The germans held the whole town that night. Dont you remember that schofield was alone and runing alone?

I do remember, but i'm not surprised by the presence of Germans in the town. I'm surprised by their apparent disorganization and unpreparedness, despite the fact that the film suggests from the beginning the cleverness and strategic prowess of the Germans.

>Why are there so many lone soldiers???  
>  
>It was a no man's land and that night the germann soldiers hold that town. WW1 station was fluid the trenches made it worse.

I guess i would have expected them to be in hidden or fortified positions, not strolling about in the open. Maybe they really didn't expect to encounter any British forces until later? But then again, Scholfield had just been dueling with a sniper in which they exchanged about twenty rounds. Then after he wakes up he fired upon repeatedly as he runs through the town before running into lone soldiers. Surely this would alert other Germans to his area as they don't seem to be very far away.

>Dude It's 1917. You're over thinking.

What about it being 1917 explains the poor shooting, other than the guys shooting from the hip? And is it really overthinking to to be critical about a movie that is clearly trying to pioneer a new level of hyper realism in war films? This isn't Star Wars after all! I get what you mean though. Regardless, this is more of a criticism of the director who made choice of having the main character evade dozens of shots fired at him. I get that it makes for an exciting scene.

I just think I would have been so jaded from being in a war, I probably would have been too desensitized to value an enemy's life.  


I'm glad Schofield was able to strangle the other soldier later in the movie.

I kept it at the back of my mind wondering if we would ever find out! It weighed on me from that point on. I had a strong feeling he may have had a kid, just from his interactions with the baby and his immediate willingness to give up his milk for it (despite not having sacrificial instincts earlier in the movie -- hesitance to go on the mission, suggestion that they not help the pilot who ends up killing Blake), but then I thought maybe it's possible he was just relishing in this brief moment of joy.

fegpyrp,"Agreed. My dad said the same thing about wasting time, but think about the journey this man just went through. He’s mentally and physically exhausted, his friend dies and then he’s being chased by Germans and he finally comes across some English soldiers. He sits down to rest and listens to the guy sing, because it’s one of the only calming and peaceful moments he’s been a part of in the last 24 hours or whatever the time frame was at that point. 

Also, at this point he believes he failed the mission and is too late, which is why he’s so confused and frantic after the other soldiers tell him that he’s in the right spot and they are the unit he’s looking for. He didn’t realize that the attack was happening in waves. He just assumed it was one massive assault that was going to take place. Once he realized this, he kicked it into high gear because he knew he could save these men. 

I also agree about the chosen song for this scene. The lyrics echo his and pretty much everyone else’s thoughts during this point. They really all just want to go home, no one really wants to fight. This, to me, was the subtle main theme of the movie. Besides his mission, the main characters main mission for himself is to just get home. This is even echoed at the end when the movie comes full circle and he’s resting under the tree looking at the pictures of his own family. He flips one of the pictures over and the quote from his wife was “Come back to us.”",emi5z3

fjr99eg,"Sure. First I think the one shot technique took a bit away from the movie. It wasn't necessary throughout the whole thing. Also, I didn't like how big name actors were thrown in. That was a bit distracting. 

The score was also distracting. The film could have done with no music at all in some of the scenes. It would have had more of an impact. 

The stakes weren't all that high either. OK so he needs to save 1600 people? Great, but then show some urgency in needing to get to the Captain or whatever rank he was. There were a few scenes where there was some urgency, but then it was like ""Ill get there when I get there.""

Ending wasn't all that great. The sniper scene was terrible. The guy running after him before he meets the French girl was bad. The explosion in the beginning was terrible, they'd be 100 percent dead. 

There's more but that's all I feel like typing for now. I guess I would have missed some stuff if I had seen it in theatres. 

Overall, not my favorite movie of last year. More like a solid 7.5/10. The story just wasn't that great, pretty lackluster. It seemed like it needed a rewrite. Not boring, just a bit of an ""eh""",emi5z3

fdsd6y8,"Yes, but only having good cinematography and stellar production choices can't make a movie great.


I'm fine with the Tommen dying, it's just that everyone else barely interacts or says anything afterwards because ""the one take"" idea limits the dialogue. The movies tries to keep a ""show but don't tell"" mentality of delivering information.


But in this case, having Tommen around longer could have given much more heart with only two main characters. The part where they're out of the trench and the duo bicker at each other and talking, that felt like the best part of the movie, then after that the female.


Imagine watching Saving Private Ryan without any real dialouge and Tom Hanks is only allowed 3 lines to each character (I know plenty of people who just watch the action scenes, but that's not the point of the movie). A lot would be missed and that movie wouldn't be remembered as much as it has.

&#x200B;

My biggest two busts with the movie were the overuse of the ""German man running at him and shooting"" in the flare-lit city, and the loss of potential with a ""humanizing the enemy"" moment.  I understood that for the thriller genre of the movie being set in World War One, we needed an enemy context, and the easiest to fill that was the obvious ""bad guys"", but I think  it would have been nice to see even a single German as a scared dude like he was for even a moment.  Or a wounded German left behind that was afraid to die.  Since the whole overarching theme of the movie is ""war is pointless and shit"", I feel that a scene like that would only add to the experience.  I was sort of hoping that would be the scene where he discovers the burning church at first - but no, that ends up being just another angry and drunk German chasing after him and shooting.

He runs through a town while drunk Germans miss him by 20 feet. He floats a few miles to his destination, gets picked up and driven there. Every step of the way everyone defers to him and guides him to the next stage, no steps backward, no misdirections, no inner struggles once he becomes the lead figure.

If you feel they did a very poor job of it that’s fine. You are allowed to have that opinion of course. But I do think you are going to be in an extreme minority in that aspect. It’s really hard to make that argument as there are very long stretches of the movie that feel like a long single scene.  The small moments where they are obvious feel almost needed like you are finally allowed to blink. 

For the plot stuff, I agree with you that it’s not really innovating or doing anything incredible there. It’s definitely something many will agree on. The one soldier having too much plot armor is part of what makes the story more exciting though. Sure it’s a Hollywood cliche and exaggeration but with such an intense single shot focus on one person you sort of need to ham up those moments to amp up the tension and intensity. It’s needed for the thin slow paced narrative to have any sort of exciting pulse. But I agree that it does reduce the sense of realism considerably.",emi5z3

fdqfcfl,"The main rifles from the period were excellent for aiming and several maintained service in their respective militaries for decades after WWI. When they were developed they were designed to be accurate in engagements at much further distances than they would actually be used in practice.

The Mauser that the Germans used was effective out to 500 meters, the American Springfield up to 550, and the British Enfields could be accurate at similar ranges.

Combat in WWI was usually at less than 100 meters. That's why you had the innovations in WWI of sub machine guns and carbines which were lighter and had a higher fire rate at the cost of shorter range. The longer range was very rarely needed.

Even after countries began switching to semi-automatic battle rifles and select fire assault rifles, these rifles were still issued to snipers because of their superior range and accuracy.

I mean they say that even trained individuals miss more than half their shots when adrenaline is high. So the german in the square missing while running and shooting from the hip makes sense. I think the rush from him at the truck was from a sense of frustration from his friend dying. He didn't want to be there in the first place but when his friend died he felt a sort of responsibility to finish his friend's mission. But later on, the slower scenes are meant to show how he is emotionally overwhelmed. Earlier on the team of two had more time to finish the mission. When he sat down to listen to the guy singing I think it was him experiencing shell shock. I mean the dude just got blown up, saw his friend die, and got shot. So I get that he would feel tired. Remember when he was floating on the log, he almost drowned because he was so tired. I think the main thing the directors were trying to convey was the sense of confusion in the war. He was lost, dazed, and most of all confused.

I liked that it was trying to paint an accurate depiction of the War and if it felt gross or scary or tense or heroic it's because those emotions were earned without the emotional manipulation of the movie's music. Maybe the score you want is more subtle than what I'm thinking but I'm glad it wasn't used to telegraph to the audience how they were supposed to be feeling at any given point. And I think it mirrored Schofield's view of things. He didn't see himself as a hero. Just someone trying to survive, do the right thing and hopefully make it home alive.",emi5z3

> The movie could have done a better job explaining the background of this trap: how they discovered it, what the impact would’ve been if they failed (briefly mentioned it in the movie but could’ve done more)


The trap was explained by the commander who sent Blake and his friend on the mission. Artillery was set up further back into a 'killzone' that the Germans were luring the English forces into. That way, the Germans could just bomb the English to death like fish in a barrel.

**The trap was discovered by aerial recon. As in a plane flew overhead and took pictures.** But they couldn't get the message to the General out in the field. No radios and implied no airstrip close by. 


It was explained in the film. We are shown the photos of the trap from the air when the characters in the film are.

fqevm4k,"I agree with your point that this movie could have massively improved its mortal ambiguity but they way I always saw the scenes was through the eye of a patriotic solider. From what I’ve learned as a Brit is that many soldiers even those who are below the age to enlist wanted to go fight cos of their sense of patriotism. 

The first solider that’s rescued from the burning plane is definitely an odd point in the movie, I thought it was out of character for the solider in that position. I try to rationalise it as the German soldiers attempt to avoid capture as a POW (the German soldier would have been unaware of their mission) 

The second instance with the German soldiers I see as easily explainable. This German soldier is caught completely off guard and so is the majority of his squad/team/division so the German has been caught and for all he knows this is an ambush and there could be others so shouting to alert his comrade was what he assumed was the best idea.

Like I said originally though, I do agree it could have done a much better job of showing moral ambiguity like in movies such as Saving Private Ryan.",emi5z3

fdu3af0,"I don't discount your opinions, but I think you went in looking for a different movie. 

I went in expecting to see a ""day in the life"" of a soldier in World War I. If I wanted war action, I would have watched Fury again (which, by the way, does very good for the first two-thirds depicting tank warfare, all the other problems aside), or Dunkirk, or Saving Private Ryan -- but I didn't want an action film. 

It would be like going into Jarhead and expecting crazy action; or We Were Soldiers. We Were Soldiers had some of the worst action I've ever seen in any movie, ever (choreographed poorly, lacking the subtlety or originality of other war movies) but it's still probably the best depiction of large-scale battles in Vietnam, and is considered one of the best war movies of all time.

World War II was a blockbuster. The movies depicting it are, largely, huge and blockbuster-y. World War I was not a blockbuster. And I'm sorry, if you didn't feel horror when he was getting charged by the soldier in the city, or the silent dread of the no-man's land, or the sheer panic of the fire fight between him and the soldier (by the way, the only movie I've ever seen that gets the sound of bullets whizzing by correctly), then you're expectations were for an action movie and not a period piece set in World War I.

EDIT: I just wanted to note, the only war movies that I've ever seen that I would consider had ""good"" action in them are largely World War II movies. People base their entire viewing (or video game) experience off of World War II, not realizing how fucking insane and huge WWII actually was. All of your examples were even from World War II. And yes, Dunkirk had a lot more action than this movie did. It was also about a lot of people in a lot of different places throughout that single event.

ff9inaz,"> The milk at the farm? Zero relevance. Thought that was supposed to show someone lived there, but nothing. Who milked it? Certainly not the Germans

I think the relevance was that he hadn't had something good in a long time, so milk was seen as a luxury to him. And why not the Germans? They just left the area. It's entirely likely that they had milked that cow. 

> He didn't hear the huge convoy of trucks and loud soldiers coming up to that farm?

I see what you're saying, but I would just wave that off as being traumatized. Ever zoned out and had someone call your name repeatedly? That's how I imagined that scene. 

> The letter was bone dry when he took it from inside his jacket after he'd been submerged in water for a long time. Those uniforms aren't that well insulated

He had stored it in a tin. 

> I personally find it difficult to believe that after his exhausting trip that he could overpower two well rested body guards to get to McKenzie

Do we know for sure they were well rested? One was so drunk he was puking in the street. They had just abandoned their lines and were likely tired from the move. Additionally, soldiers that were in the trenches were never really well rested and he had been in the trenches 24 hours prior. 

> And when he got off the trucks and got sniped at like 60 seconds later, why didn't the convoy he was with do anything? I find it hard to believe they were far enough away to not hear that shot and not help as the officer still had to get back on a truck and everyone drive away and it was pretty soon after

I get this one. If I had to explain it, I'd guess that it's because they had a time frame of their own and didn't think it was worthwhile to assault a town over pop shots.",emi5z3

Soldiers literally step on IED's and survive. I was 15 feet away when a 500 lb IED went off under a truck and I'm perfectly fine. There's nothing unrealistic about surviving that. 

> and he also gets hit by an artillery shell while running in the final trench yet the death comes from one stab wound to the lower abdomen through 4 layers of clothing where he dies quicker than the German who got shot in the heart in the house.

I don't remember Blake getting hit with an artillery shell? And yeah, that can happen. It's clothing not armor lol. People have literally died from a single punch and survived being shot multiple times. How is this a real criticism?

> He literally sits and plays with a baby for an extended period of time and also sits down and listens to the kid singing... just to miss being able to save 400 men by 1 minute. That was the most ridiculous thing. Thank god this isn't a true story because I would be embarrassed to be a relative of a guy who sent 400 men to their death because he wanted to play with a baby for 2 hours.

I can actually agree with this to an extent. I'd actually understand the baby thing because the town was populated by German soldiers and he needed to hide, but I dont understand stopping for the singing.

Like the riding in the truck scene you mentioned - probably several hours had passed and he was just silently staring off into nowhere, traumatized about what happened.

But my friend really tries to get into the films I convince him to see in theaters, and I got him to come see 2049 without seeing the original just mainly for the visuals in 3D and stuff. He was enjoying it (unlike my other friend who ended up not paying for the ticket since he hated it, even though the ticket was originally for a friend who bailed last minute then didn't pay) but when Jared Leto cuts an android across the stomach, he said ""I've gotta go to the bathroom"" and ran out of the theater, kicking the teen besides me's popcorn across the theater (since they reasonably set it down in the walkway). I convinced him through texting on my watch to come back in, but he was just so confused then after missing nearly an hour. It's so strange, he adores war movies; no problems with 1917 yesterday or Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, etc. But this scene upset him immensely.

There were probably a few AWOL or rogue German soldiers who got mingled with the above group.

There was nothing negative about my previous comment so I'm not sure what you mean by ""continue to spew negativity"".

If you found another post, I wrote ""only"" in quotations, meaning it's actually a very long time in context. I got lazy and didn't put it in quotations here. Does it really matter? I was making a correction that there was a lot of takes, and that the longest take was 12 minutes long. In a 2 hour long movie, that would indicate there has to have been at least, mathematically, over 10 takes (not 5).

What a lame death some might think, getting stabbed. But that happens. Not everyone gets a hero's death. They don't go out in a blaze of glory. Some get the top of their head shaved off by a bullet sleeping in a trench. Some get stabbed by a German pilot offscreen. I think it adds to the frustration and makes it more relatable to Schofield's character. He's riding int he truck with the boys in the following scene, silent for most of it. Grieving but also frustrated that he wasn't paying attention like he should. Frustrated that he probably should have insisted to just mercy kill the pilot instead of take a chance (Especially seeing everything that occured in the somme).

This is probably an obvious point to some, but there's some great anti-war commentary in whose eyes we are meant to see the war through. The film seems to be saying that Schofield, the soldier who eschewed glory for comfort and survival (quite literally) is a more fitting proxy for the audience. Blake is the archetype the audience thought fought in the Great War, who we would like to see ourselves as, while Schofield, though incredibly heroic, was forced into that heroism -- he's who we really are.

I'm glad you brought this up because before thinking about that, I kind of viewed 1917 as purely a technical achievement. It doesn't seem to have much to ""say"" on first viewing.

Like I said previously, most films are never spoiled by trailers. Specific parts of the film are revealed but in most cases, the advertisements still hide the  majority of what the film will entail.  Also, in the case of your argument, any knowledge about a film prior to seeing it is a spoiler by your definition. I cannot agree with that sentiment.

In the case of 1917, the entire film is shown.  Seriously, go back and watch the first trailer that was released. I've been watching film and television for over thirty years and I cannot recall ever experiencing this.

Also the main character in this one kinda just gets pushed along gives the occasional 1000 yrd stare while everyone in Dunkirk felt like they were really driven and fighting to survive. One reason I might not be falling for this movie is because I didn't see it in a typical theater, on my base we have a glorified high school auditorium so I can't relate to everyone saying it had them feeling like they were in the trenches.

A chaotic shot isn't bad, there just needs to be an establishing shot at some point to ground the audience. Those were extremely few and far between.

There were three placid scenes that I can think of. Opening. In the truck. Ending. I don't think the singing scene is placid since he is so disoriented at the time. In those placid scenes the scope was very narrow, and did not explore anything beyond the characters.

It doesn't have to be lazy writing. It is just writing without meaning. With as many war movie tropes that occurred in the movie it doesn't really fit to ""subvert expectations"" on just a couple of them. That is just inconsistent writing.

It was kind of repetitive at that point.

Overall, I agree. Pretty great movie. The single shot really made for amazing story telling and they used it to its true potential.

But I’d argue Star Wars still has an engaging plot, memorable characters, an amazing score, great world building, and a ton of practical effects, that would still make the films enjoyable without the visual effects. At least for the original trilogy, those films succeeded in their technical aspects, *on top* of having good scripts. I don’t necessarily want to compare Star Wars to 1917, since they’re very different films, but one could argue Star Wars has more “well rounded” films, compared to 1917. If you think 1917 was an excellent film in all aspects, then you certainly have a right to that opinion.

The Vaughan Williams piece is certainly similar. I'd say if you combine that with the LOTR piece then it's extremely close to The Night Window.

The trap stuff, maybe I missed it and would have to rewatch. I’ll admit it was mentioned with the General at the beginning but very briefly and very early on.

Also, how did he run, several times, directly in the line of site of the enemy and not get shot? Seems a bit unrealistic.

ferv9j3,"Interesting observations. I hadn't even considered the optimist/pessimist divide between them. I just don't think the conversation they had quite fitted in with the opening scene of the movie.

For me it would have worked better if Blake and Schofield were sat resting in a group with a couple of other soldiers. Blake is asked to pick a man, Schofield pretends to be a asleep, and the other two soldiers look up towards Blake. Blake then puts his hand out towards Schofield, despite him looking the least interested in being chosen.

I think that would have given his question a little more substance.",emi5z3

Half the armies fighting were still in the imperial stand-in-formation-with-a-musket-and-shoot-then-reload-and-hope-you-aren’t-the-one-that-gets-popped mentality. Most of the tactics and strategy used were devised during the war, and long after the fighting had started. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers had already died from leaders taking chances and thinking things would be how they always were, only to be slaughtered or die from lack of preparation. Blake helped the pilot because he was brought up to think there was a code and sense of honor in battle, from what he knew of battles before. And he was a young man barely out of school, he still had empathy and a naïvety about him. You can see it in the beginning when he’s grilling Schofield about his medal, or when Schofield speaks down to him about not having been at past battles where he was the horrors he had.",emi5z3

feom8op,"You’re not understanding the concept of humanity and specifically empathy.

The German soldier and the British soldier are both just guys fighting in a war they don’t want to be in. Neither of them at a soldier level are bad. 

Blake talking about how his mum has an orchard and how he knows the different types of trees is because he is a human. The German would have equivalent memories.

By your logic, Cumberbatch’s character at the end is a good guy just because he’s with the Allies. He initially rejects the idea to halt/retreat despite an order from a general until he’s further informed. After which he tells our protagonist to fuck off. 

These are just normal men, like men you and I know, put in a horrific situation at a young age. They see someone burning in a plane and can empathise what that would be like and have an instinctive desire to help.",emi5z3
fdwpl3g,"The pilot had just been saved from a burning plane. It would have made more sense if he had a less fiery landing and came to and just pulled his pistol and started shooting. Idk I liked the movie overall but that scene in my opinion was awful.

For example the young German soldier at night was much more believable because the two guys hadn’t just rescued him. It would make sense for him to scream out.",emi5z3
fdylhu8,"Schofield was realistically right to say they should put the pilot out of his misery, too. Two soldiers on a vital time-sensitive mission, who are passing through no man's land with no real indication of reinforcements or the means to care for a wounded prisoner of war...

Clearly that's pretty brutal, but it aligns with Schofield's more wearily experienced view of war compared to Blake's, who hadn't experienced the Somme and still put value in things like decorations or being mentioned in dispatches.

If I were being uncharitable I'd say Blake died partially through naivety, but I don't think that's entirely fair. 

I think the point is that war perverts virtue. Trying to save a wounded enemy is a noble thing to do. The movie asks if, in the context of a horrible and indiscriminately lethal conflict, is it the right way to stay alive?",emi5z3
fekxp8m,"Except it sounds like he's only getting shot by one or two dudes. Then we see randomly see various soldiers just wandering around by themselves throughout, which is highly unrealistic. And the handful of soldiers were the same two that we saw before chasing him.

ff9qea3,">I think the relevance was that he hadn't had something good in a long time, so milk was seen as a luxury to him. And why not the Germans? They just left the area. It's entirely likely that they had milked that cow. 

Sorry, when I say relevance, I was expecting something to come from it. Like when they kicked over the pot of embers earlier on to show the trenches had been recently evacuated. The scene existed purely so he had milk to give to the woman and child. 

I don't buy that the Germans razed every single cow in the area (as shown minutes later) and, presumably, destroyed crops, but left a single cow alive and seemingly ok milk lying outside? It's possible, I'm just not convinced 

>I see what you're saying, but I would just wave that off as being traumatized. Ever zoned out and had someone call your name repeatedly? That's how I imagined that scene. 

Yes, I do buy the shock thing. He may not have heard a plane going by overhead or someone talking next to him. I've changed my mind on this one. 

>He had stored it in a tin. 

I replied to someone earlier saying it didn't look all that sturdy of a tin. It's explainable, I just don't think that tin could be completely submerged for long periods of time getting thrashed about and come out ok

>Do we know for sure they were well rested? One was so drunk he was puking in the street. They had just abandoned their lines and were likely tired from the move. Additionally, soldiers that were in the trenches were never really well rested and he had been in the trenches 24 hours prior. 

Again, I apologize here for the misunderstanding. I'm not referring to the German he fought off, but the allied soldiers guarding Mackenzie at the end. The two of them were holding him against a wall to make sure he couldn't get in to see him. Our hero made a small shrug and got through both of them

>I get this one. If I had to explain it, I'd guess that it's because they had a time frame of their own and didn't think it was worthwhile to assault a town over pop shots.

Agreed, I wouldn't expect them to conduct an all out assault on the town, but if their guy was getting shot at, I'd imagine they'd at least make sure he made it over the broken bridge. That's all they could realistically do",emi5z3

I think the few years in between the filming for GoT Season 6 to the filming of 1917 made enough of a difference for his casting not to be jarring to any GoT fans. Season 6 was filmed in 2015 when the actor was only 16/17 compared to 1917 when he would have been 21/22 during filming. That can make a big difference for someone so young.

It’s amazing how little cuts they did have. This extremely difficult style isn’t so much a director going “Look at what we can do” brag like some one-takes are, which are typically action, but powerfully serves the story by giving us an endless, easy to follow window into a couple soldiers trying to do their duty and go through hell.

Not sure if I believe it, because German and American helmets, uniforms, and weaponry were VERY different and immediately distinguishable. Especially the helmet.

And when he stayed with the woman it didn't suddenly become morning, he walked outside and it was sunrise, still dark as he was walking away, he stumbled into the guard and choked him out in the dark. As he ran from those soldiers to the river the sun came up and by the time he had come out of the water it was finally bright.

And the rest of the movie was pretty clearly designed to seem like it was one continuous shot, so imo even if you can argue some of the time pacing seemed a bit unrealistic I wouldn't go as far as to say it was intended for some artistic value. But who knows I guess",emi5z3

fdptg6a,"Have you read anything at all about WWI?  WWII was certainly a ""necessary"" war as much as any war can be, but WWI was practically the definition of a meaningless war.  16 million people died, fighting over yards of territory, all because of the complicated entanglements of Imperial governments who were tied into complicated defensive alliances and were attempting to control influence in Europe.  Germany declared war on Serbia. The Russians entered the war due to an alliance with Serbia. The French entered the war due to an alliance with Russia. The British entered the war under the auspice of protecting Belgian neutrality, and the Americans entered the war due to public opinion that the Germans were bad (caused, among other reasons, due to industrialists arms shipments being sunk by Germany).  It was essentially a bunch of inbred royals using 16 million humans to settle a spat.  In fact, the King of Great Britain, the Czar of Russia and the Kaiser of Germany were all first cousins.

Ww2 was a necessary war, but it only became necessary because of our dreadful (as a species, not any particular country) handling of ww1- ww2 was such a natural and obvious reaction to the events of ww1 that I have heard historians say that when the period is viewed later through a more distant lens, they will probably be considered a single war with a short break.",emi5z3

The dialogue with the french lady was all around confusing for many reasons, but I do think him having a child is meant to decode that whole scene. What I first just took as him sort of being bewildered at the miracle of a baby surviving in all of this, I'm realizing now maybe can be symbolism for his hope that he we will see his family again! But for now, he must leave. Wow, okay, initially I wasn't planning to watch again, but the writing is so literary (like someone else in the comments section mentioned the presence of nature elements that encapsulate major sections of the movie which blew my mind). I think it might be worth rewatching to absorb more of what we have been talking about. My hesitation is that I generally don't like to watch emotional movies just to torture myself, but this seems to have deeper value where a rewatch is totally warrented. 

One last thing - I think the picture he looks at in the end is a wife and 1 daughter. I can't really remember.

It's not just the night or day thing. The fact there there are multiple scenes with just one of them in tells me that it can't happen near the end of the movie.

That's the problem though, the two leads in this film were clearly still in that early war mentality and were willing to give the Germans they came into direct contact with a chance to live whilst the Germans were depicted as vicious killers, which considering the titular year does make more sense. 

There is a dichotomy there which is too sharp, the Brits got the moral high ground as every German kill was righteous or in self-defence so we the audience could see them as heroes.

He's either sitting on one dude's face or a two shot for an uncomfortable amount of time, or slowly drifting to the reverse shot and trying not to seem obvious about it but is. Then the cuts between shots were so blaringly obvious and off putting at times, too. It is definitely objectively worse, and I don't necessarily blame him for it.

But, and I'm only guessing here, once Mr Mendes decided to write a the story told in real time...and wanted to make it appear as one shot he made the creative decision to jettison any attempt at allowing for a backstory. He wanted to tell a 8 hour story and had a squeeze it into a 2 hour film. Who is Schofield? It's not important. He represents all the guys who fought in WWI. The important thing is to give us a narrative that gives us an excuse to drop the camera (and hence us the movie goers) into the world of 1917

There are a lot of us film fans who are tired of the lazy writing in a lot of films today. I don't care to spend 2 hours watching a story that explains in exact details why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, just so in the last 10 minutes we get to see him as Darth Vader.  Fuck that.

I liked that interaction for the most part and it helps contextualize the other innosence getting caught up in human misery, aka war.  But after that scene the main character walks out to the buurning building during the night and sees a black figure approaching him.  The main character walks up to him without any kind of hesitation.  What in the hell was that scene anyway.  Neither one of them were remotely cautious until the other figure decides to start shooting when they are withing high-fiving range.  They didn't go over stuff like that in basic training.  I saw the movie with my dad who was in the military and he said that was the single dumbest thing he has seen in a war movie.  That would never happen and he'd be dead.  Also, when the main character is running away from the dark figure they stumble around, which makes sense, but then the enemy stumbles down about 10 feet away and the main character LOUDLY kicks in a boarded up window to escape.  Literally 10 seconds later the enemy walks by non the wiser.

There was also the fact that the mission itself was basically a suicide mission, and that they really weren’t that pressed to save 1600 men that they would risk more than two men to save them.

Well, to figure out how quickly it becomes morning, you have to talk about what was it like *before* he went in to the woman, not what happens after.

Why do you think the conversation in the truck can jump hours but not the conversation with the woman, esp when it startles the protagonist so much?

And it all hinges on how long you think he's knocked out, as well.  If he's knocked out till basically early morning (roughly 10 minutes before the bell rings when he's with the woman), then he's knocked out for the majority of the time that the narrative takes place (!) because he gets knocked out with a bit of light still in the sky, and then wakes up right before light returns. Are we supposed to believe he's knocked out basically the whole night?  Ok, well if not, then time has to skip some time between him wakin up and him hearing the bell with the woman, but then when?

See? It gets very tricky, very quickly.

>so imo even if you can argue some of the time pacing seemed a bit unrealistic

To be clear, I'm not saying its unrealistic at all.  On the contrary, I'm more interested in the fact that it presents time closer to how we realistically experience it subjectively, especially in chaotic and stressful situations, ie certainly as a continuous flow but not parceled out in perfect proportions.  

Our subjective experience of the flow of time is different than the objective flow of time, and I think the movie realistically captures this as well as a movie could possibly do so.",emi5z3

WW1 began as an imperialist war over control of the Balkans. As it escalated it became so much more than that. By 1917 the character of the war had completely changed, look at the treaty of Brest-Litvosk ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_of\_Brest-Litovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk)) where the Germans annexed a vast area of Eastern Europe, turning them into vassal states under German ethnic control - sounds familiar?

&#x200B;

>Most of these territories were in effect ceded to Germany, which  intended to have them become economic and political dependencies. The  many ethnic German residents (*volksdeutsch*) would be the ruling elite. New monarchies were created in Lithuania and the [United Baltic Duchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Baltic_Duchy) (which comprised the modern countries of Latvia and Estonia). The German aristocrats [Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Karl,_Duke_of_Urach) (in Lithuania), and [Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Friedrich,_Duke_of_Mecklenburg-Schwerin) (in the United Baltic Duchy), were appointed as rulers.

Allied soldiers and leaders would be thinking they were defending France and Belgium from loss of self-determination. 

Was the German empire as astonishing evil as the Nazi's? No, of course not, but allied soldiers would have understood what they were fighting for and why it mattered. WW1 wasn't as clear cut as WW2, but German high command, which had effectively become the military dictators of Germany by 1917 were pretty bad- only focused on crushing their enemies no matter the cost. Most of that class became the literal Nazi's a couple of decades later. 

Also the counties of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Finland and (sort-of) Ireland all gained independence through the upheaval of WW1. Was WW1 pointless for those countries?

I think what would benefit you in regards to being a more educated film viewer would be to read about the psychological aspects of war, and how each soldier reacts to them differently. Just because one dude was crying and no one else wasn’t, doesn’t mean no one else was terrified.",emi5z3

For example when they're crossing no man's land or when he gets on the truck and you're forced to watch soldiers piss on the side of a building. You just feel like you aren't a part of the film because of this technique. Now that's not to say I wish there were NO long takes. I thought it worked quite well at the end and in the ruins scene (although these scenes were hampered as well as a result of Hollywood-BS). It sounds like I didn't like the film - I kinda did.

>The movie does do a great job of un-glamourising the battlefield, but with the light character work and very involved camera spectacle   
  
Again, I completely disagree about the camera spectacle idea.  I wrote this about the cinematography and direction elsewhere in this thread:   
  
>I think the one-take can sometimes feel like it's less about the narrative and more in service of the cinematography. Which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing but personally, I always feel like the story comes first and goal of the cinematography should be to compliment and enhance the story, not call attention to itself.
  

>In 1917 the camera work was definitely all about the story. Which makes complete sense given how much of a chameleon Deakins is and how his style can change so much between films in order to suit the narrative above all else.
  

>Here the cinematography was completely focused on putting the viewer right there in the mud with Tom and William. You are right in the trenches with these two young men and this was one of the only war films to really make me understand just how awful and hellish it was from the perspective of the individual soldiers. It really illustrated to me that these guys don't have this big, strategic overview of the war but for them it's just about surviving one moment to the next and trying to stay alive long enough to get home to their families.   
  
So no, I don't for one second buy into the idea that 1917 is somehow irresponsible filmmaking and I'd go so far to say that's a completely misguided and ridiculous idea from someone trying too hard to come up with some hot takes.  If you're going to say that 1917 is irresponsible than what war movie isn't?",emi5z3

ff0n4x8,"There's a whole FAQ over at r/askhistorians but essentially he's not a historian - his sources are often dodgy, if there are two ways of interpreting things, he'll go with the most exciting or extreme version, he occasionally gets his facts wrong or talks about outdated theories.

He says often that he's not a historian but a history *fan*, and that's fine (and as an entertainer and presenter of history he's *brilliant*), but it's the same problem you get with historical movies. No matter how much you know that it might not be right, if you're coming from a position of not knowing much/anything, you're not going to know what's real and what's not.

Like, in 1917, there are black soldiers visible in British regiments, which promped a whole bunch of questions in AH going ""???!! Movie showed mixed -race regiments???"" and the usual twitter gammons complaining about ""woke casting"" and the like.

In fact, black men in WW1 UK were a tiny but obviously highly visible minority (the majority of the UK's non-white population stems from post-WW2). Black boxers like Jack Johnson and footballers like Walter Tull were already well-known (Tull died at the Somme in fact). 

However, because for decades pretty much every depiction of British Soldiers in WW1 has been exclusively white - and in the case of US viewers, knowing that US forces were segregated until after WW2 - we've all just sort of internalised the Bad History that ""there were no black men in the trenches"". 

It's a difficult balance to strike, Dan does his best and I was only semi-serious - but it's always worth using his stuff as a springboard to investigate more.",emi5z3
fea45s7,"I think it kind of had condensed time despite not cutting- the amount of time they are traveling to equal 9 miles does not make sense. They’re only driving for about 10 minutes at maybe 30 mph so that only eats up about 3 miles. The pace they were going would not equal the other 6 miles, plus the change of landscapes was so huge for such little walking time. 

It’s a necessary method to take and I agree there were no points that he could have reloaded, but the time was definitely condensed to equal how far they went.",emi5z3
fdtd66s,That’s not true at all. Unless you think he was just laying there bleeding out the back of his head for like 6 hours it just doesn’t make sense.,emi5z3
feb5755,"Maybe it's a stretch, sure.  I'm trying to say that it's a stretch, *to some significant degree*, however you cut it.  Already in this mini-tread at least 3 different points have been considered possible points of time-jumping by three different people. 

And at no point have I disputed that it's fluid.  I literally said the opposite. What I have tried to do is pull into doubt what we mean by fluid here.  A river is fluid, too, but it rarely flows uniformly. All I'm really getting at is I think the movie opens a very interesting question up for us, ie how we experience time.

To put it simply (and this is how I should have initially put it) it's like the ""time flies when you're having fun"" phenomenon.  I feel the movie says something about this, but in the context of hell rather than fun.
 
Your criteria in your offered interpretation here seems to be you know what the ""purpose"" of the ""single-take"" is but how do you know that?  Common sense?  If so, that's pretty arbitrary.  That's the deepest arbitrariness there is.  Like I said above, in this mini-tread at least 3 different points have been considered possible points of time-jumping by three different people's common sense.  In the words of one of my old bosses, common sense isn't so common.

If we nevertheless stick with your interpretation, which I think seems pretty rigorous as far as hacking out the specifics of time and helps me understand the larger timeframe much better, you seem to think ~80% of the entire arc of the story is him passed out unconscious!  That the great majority of a story ""*showcas[ing]* *a* *single* *fluid* *timeline*"" takes place outside of any experience of time at all!  Can you at least see how disruptive of an idea of unified time that interpretation can be?  That our sense of time-continuity is being *literally* based on a huge lack time?  Sort of putting ourselves in the character's own shoes, as he obviously loses a sense of what time it is as evidenced by his reaction to the bells ringing?  At what point did you personally realize so much time had passed? *When* were you absolutely positive?

And as far as ""overthinking"" things (this is directed more at u/blaarfengaar)... well that's just bullshit.  It's art.  It's a major part of appreciating art to push and pull on it and explore interpretations.  You don't have to do that to enjoy it, but there is a ton of other fun you could be having if you try to be critical of film and see it from many angles, including, and even maybe especially, what might initially seem like stretches.

In this light, it actually doesn't seem like a stretch at all to think the movie opens up the question of time and experience.

My issue with your argument is that the *entire* movie shows you (the viewer) the horrors of war. Blake dying, bloated corpses on the river, dead soldiers in no man’s land, severely wounded soldiers in the medical camp, etc. I didn’t need a bunch of crying soldiers to tell me that war was horrific.

I’m just saying that if pilots are armed, and this pilot was just shot down in an attempt to kill people fighting on their side, why wouldn’t they assume he would try to kill them?

We're shown the whole way they travel, and yeah, truck sequence, even being generous, wouldn't add up enough to get the whole 9 miles in the end. With all the distractions along the way, *and* next to no sprinting, no way they made that trip in 2 hours real time. It would *maybe* be possible if walking really, really, really quickly, in a straight line, without stop, but they obviously didn't.

Didn't bother me, but yeah, came to mind for me as well.

Looking forward to someone eventually doing the math on this. Without thinking too much, I'd guess the scale of the distance actually traveled is at least as low as 50% of the stated amount.",emi5z3

C'mon. War movies do not typically rely on complicated plots in the way, say, a thriller or a spy movie do. This is because the war setting is usually chaotic and dramatic enough to keep audiences interested in it's own.

It also makes sense when you realize these guys aren’t five star generals they are just two young men wayyyy out of their depth. They made the wrong decision and it cost them. I’m not saying there is a mark on your humanity or something wrong with anyone asking that question, it’s more people that can’t grasp why they would try to help the man even with a full explanation.
