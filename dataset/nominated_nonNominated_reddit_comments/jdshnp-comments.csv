g9a6vj7,"2020’s utopias ranked -

1) **AMERICAN UTOPIA** - David Byrne’s life affirming wiggle jam. Brilliantly simple, it left me with a smile I still can’t wipe from my face. 

2) **UTOPIA AVENUE** - David Mitchell’s moving and historical deep dive into the formation of a fictional late 60’s prog-rock band. 

3) **UTOPIA** - a show on Amazon Prime.",jdshnp
g9a7hs2,"I was fortunate to be able to see the touring concert version of American Utopia in 2018, and I'm so glad I can now revisit that experience over and over from my couch. This was a much-needed mood booster to close out 2020.",jdshnp
g9a75bo,Spike coming out swinging with that George Floyd tribute. Great film,jdshnp
g9aey96,Pure bliss. I started a rewatch within an hour after finishing it. Can’t wait for more. I’m very tempted to buy tickets for Broadway in 2021 (already on sale starting Sept. 2021) hoping the world is back to normal.,jdshnp
g9a55mx,David Byrne is just the best kind of weird,jdshnp
g9h45hy,"Missed this thread, but I watched it live. I’m a huge Talking Heads fan who will turn Stop Making Sense on whenever I just need something on, so I’m **incredibly** biased, but I absolutely loved this. And funny enough, IMO, the solo work was 1000x better than the Talking Heads material (with the exception of Once in a Lifetime and I Zimbra). Blind was amazing with the shadows, and I am now obsessed with Jacquelene Acevedo (the female percussionist).

Overall just gives me good feelings.",jdshnp
g9a5oe7,Loved this but also hate how much it makes me wish I was at a concert right now.,jdshnp
g9bo3gm,"Absolutely loved this. It felt fresh, lively, upbeat, and delightful to watch. The band was amazing; everyone was in sync, and the renditions of some of the old Talking Heads songs were great. Spike Lee’s direction was fantastic as well. I love how he didn’t just put a camera in front of the stage; the way he shot it really added to the energy of the show. The overhead shots in particular were really well-done. 

Also- This Must Be the Place is the most perfect song ever recorded imo, and their performance here was just euphoric. Worth the watch just for that part alone.",jdshnp
g9c8d7g,No spoilers but should I watch Stop Making Sense before watching this?,jdshnp
g9acaxc,"The pure musicianship on display was just amazing to see, especially since haven’t been able to experience a live concert in 6+ months.",jdshnp
g9b2i7i,This is the exact sort of movie I wanted this year. It's full of hope and good vibes but also doesn't ignore the issues America is facing. David Byrne is such a unique but magnetic front man. It genuinely felt like a sequel to Stop Making Sense.,jdshnp
g9ax8ba,"I saw the show live a couple years ago but as a concert, and the added sort of narrative and the way it wrapped and tied things up with how it began really added a lot to what I already thought was a perfect show

losing 'brain connections' as we grow up and the idea of getting them back but on the outside by just relating to each other in a better way, while even having a bit in the middle, which ties to a song, about trying to do so with technology and tv but failing

it's just so well thought-out and constructed, specially considering these songs weren't originally intended to tie this way at all or nothing

not a particularly original or super deep message, but it's just delivered in a beautiful way, and it's the cherry on top of already the best show I've ever seen live and a fucking insane display of musical prowess

beautiful",jdshnp
g9c7egw,"I watched Stop Making Sense over the summer, loved it, thought it was genuinely fantastic and probably the best concert film I had seen. 

That being said, I think I loved this even more. The visuals alone were worth being sold on, with David Byrne & Spike Lee both being visual geniuses, so putting them together was bound to create a cool result. 

Entertaining, great music, and a powerful message, this is easily one of my favorite films of the year.",jdshnp
g9a8gv6,A worthwhile modern successor to Stop Making Sense.  It’s just delightful.,jdshnp
g9ab1py,"It's been months since I last worked at a live concert, let alone went to one for fun. This really made me miss live performances and being at one, and plus I stan David Byrne hard. Amazing show",jdshnp
g9bz8j9,"Stop Making Sense is one of my all time favorite films and this felt like such a unique modern way of doing it. I love how spare the staging is so you can see how complex the movements and lighting cues were. The chains were great and there was constant reinvention on how they were used which I loved. 

Also me and my boyfriend have decided that ""our song"" is Road to Nowhere so we were super happy it capped off the show!",jdshnp
g9g8oht,"Byrne was in my city summer of 2018 preforming this show, but I was out of town for a wedding. So extremely bummed I wasn't able to see this live.",jdshnp
g9advdp,"I wonder why Spike Lee chose this project. I'm not casting aspersions on either Byrne or Lee, they're both great artists, but it's an unexpected collaboration, isn't it?",jdshnp
g9c5w8z,This is a guy who’s singing and dancing on a theater stage ... for those who don’t know what they’re getting into.,jdshnp
g9cif9l,"Reposting what I posted about this fantastic movie last week (tl;dr one of my favourite films of the year and maybe the most joyful film I've seen in a long time):

>I just watched it today at the London Film Fest and I don't think there's gonna be another movie this year that'll make me feel the way this movie did. From the infectious music to the surreal choreography to the crowd reactions (sometimes the camera itself take the perspective of an audience member), you can feel so much joy and energy within the movie. I also loved the way it highlights each background performer, making it feel less like they're a bunch of disparate props but an actual community of people who are working together and with Byrne. The movie does have some emotional but necessary moments, specifically a cover of Janelle Manoe's Hell You Talmbout, that adds to Byrne's (and Lee's) plea to create an American utopia, where people are able to truly connect and empathize with each other.

>It's my favourite Spike Lee film of the year and amongst his best ever.",jdshnp
g9avubj,"Just watched it, amazing film. Even though I never saw the live version (I'm in Brazil and I couldn't afford it when the tour came this way in 2018), I'm a huge fan of the original album and of the cast recording, and I plan to catch it at least once in 2021, when the Broadway run restarts. 

Part of the spectacle is how Lee chose to film the show: there are some cool weird angles and unexpected zooms that really complement the whole thing. I didn't love the banter in-between songs (they didn't really make the gig flow, with one or two exceptions) but it's nothing that made it worse. The performance of Janelle Monae's ""Hell You Talmbout"" was powerful, with pictures of the people mentioned in the lyrics being shown on screen.

The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that a few songs were abridged, such as ""Everyday Is A Miracle"" (a whole verse and chorus were cut). I was also expecting ""The Great Curve"" to be part of the encore as it is in the album.",jdshnp
g9adv8c,where can I watch this?,jdshnp
g9bb88q,"I have loved David Byrne since listening to a cassette of Little Creatures at a friend's house in the mid 80s.

I enjoyed the film immensely. I really like the speaking sections which gently guided the narrative.

I was fortunate enough to watch the film as part of the London Film Festival and there was a recorded interview with David before they showed the film. He talked about how he wasn't there to preach, rather show than tell. Seeing a diverse group of people create something wonderful and joyful was the message.

Also, David said you were meant to experience it as though you were in the audience or on the stage, that it was the real thing.

So, I thought the section with big red writing and all the photos was jarring. It went against the subtlety of the rest of performance. The music behind it was beautiful, and I think it would have been just as powerful without. The song's lyrics were ""say his name"", or ""say her name"". We didn't need to show their face. It was incongruous with the lyrics and the rest of the show. They also added George Floyd who had died since the performance, and wasn't named in the song. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but it felt unnecessary. If they were adding to the names to make it more current, or to tap into the present feeling, I don't think that was needed. It's a powerful song as it is, and I wonder whether it diminishes it.

The sound they all make together is really great, the sound crew did an amazing job.

Also, I love it whenever David picks up a guitar.

Overall I really enjoyed the film. I took my son to see it, and I really hoped he would pick up some of the love of weirdness, great musicianship, freedom, joy, ambiguity, beautiful presentation and performance. We'll see.",jdshnp
g9dqxvs,Just wonderful. I've a feeling Jonathan Demme would've really loved this.,jdshnp
g9b70aq,Would be interesting if this won Best Documentary thus giving Spike Lee his 1st win for a film.,jdshnp
g9cw89w,My friend and I reviewed this for [our podcast about documentaries. ](https://anchor.fm/doc-pod/episodes/David-Byrnes-American-Utopia-2020-el8tob) Definitely watch Stop Making Sense if you haven’t! This film is entirely different but they’re definitely in conversation with one another. It’s good not great imo.,jdshnp
g9fvpwq,"Okay, but how much drugs was that guy at the end of the show on?",jdshnp
g9dw4w9,I'm surprised they got jennifer Lawrence on cowbell. Wasn't expecting that!,jdshnp
i6js4wu,"Im an 80s baby, so although I was too young to understand what these songs were about when I first heard them, these were some of the first songs I ever heard. 

Seeing and hearing David Byrne in “American Utopia”  brought back an immense amount of nostalgia for me, leaving me in awe-filled chills the entire time. 

“Once in a Lifetime” (heard in the car as a toddler on a car ride with entire family) and “Road to Nowhere” (first heard when watching “Little Monsters” as a kid) have been songs that have gotten me through some of the toughest times in my life, and also helped me ride the wave in some of the best.  

The power and message behind this entire performance was so strong that, by the time the ending approached, and “Road to Nowhere” started playing, the tears just released.  

Nostalgia, missing how things used to be with family, wishing for peace and justice, David Byrne’s voice. This is one of the best performances I’ve ever watched. So thankful!",jdshnp
g9aaof6,"I saw the tour live as well and it was really great, one of the best concerts I've seen. It's inevitable that things like this will get compared to Stop Making Sense but that tour really deserved the comparison. I'm excited to watch the film",jdshnp
hmlizgf,Go see this on Broadway if you haven't yet!,jdshnp
g9ddkoo,"There was a good interview with Spike Lee and David Byrne. Spike Lee was like ""You didn't hire me just to point a camera at the stage, I don't roll like that!"" and he was cracking up David Byrne and the interviewer.",jdshnp
g9deqlq,"I would! I think they're definitely in dialogue with one another. Plus, Stop Making Sense rules and you should take any chance you can to watch it.",jdshnp
gi1neuu,"It's the best concert film ever, everyone should make time for it regardless!",jdshnp
g9bygl7,There was a tribute to Jonathan Demme in the credits! I really think Spike is carrying on his legacy in live performance. His doc Passing Strange is incredible.,jdshnp
g9ag35f,"New York. Dance. Performance. Creatives in common.

Lee's filmography is way diverse and Byrne has his irons in lots of different fires.",jdshnp
g9byx8e,"There's a BLM protest song that has a very Spike Lee editing style. Clearly a big driver. 

But also Lee has become a big fan of stage recording with Passing Strange, Rodney King, and Pass Over. And this is a show all about multiculturalism and the power of diverse voices working together. And Byrne uses it for voting pledges and signups! I can see why he dug this one a lot.",jdshnp
g9axadh,"besides everything already said, watch it till the end. It has a big part of it relating to current events.",jdshnp
g9b2k12,The show is pretty political especially towards the end which is Spike's MO,jdshnp
g9agigu,They’re both in NYC and came up around the same time. Lee has an affinity for people who lived in NYC around the time he did as well as anything NYC. See also: how he bonded with John Turturro and  the non race relation movies he’s done like 25th Hour. I don’t doubt Lee likes to be on Broadway in someway.,jdshnp
g9bbgew,In what ways is it unexpected?,jdshnp
g9adxjl,HBO Max,jdshnp
g9ae7a7,The post says Disney+ but I was looking around and I think it’s actually HBO Max,jdshnp
g9gp0nm,"I appreciated David using his platform to support BLM, and I thought that section of the film was very impactful. I thought adding Floyd and Brianna Taylor in there really hit home. This has been an issue for so long, and 2020 has really thrust it into the spotlight. I think drawing such attention to it with the photos and red letters was a good choice and fit the themes of the show. This is not a message to be delivered subtly in my eyes.",jdshnp
g9uf9eo,"Definitely respectfully disagree on the part showing their faces. I believe that part was *meant* to be jarring, and expressed the theme of the show extremely well. The entire show had an overt political message, saying that we need to realize each other’s humanity. Each of those people they showed were demonized after death by half of the country. Forcing the viewer to see their faces in the midst of a show about human connection was a powerful way to connect those themes to current events, and to humanize real victims who many refuse to empathize with due to their political beliefs. I loved it.",jdshnp
g9ci7s2,"Concert films aren't up for Best Documentary. And this is a TV film that aired on HBO (like with Bad Education) so it wouldn't be eligible either way. Like with Hamilton, this will be in next year's Emmys.",jdshnp
g9bcl4d,Spike already has an Oscar,jdshnp
g9gnxwf,"I thought it was fantastic! Definitely one of the most entertaining concert movies I've seen. Stop Making Sense is great too, and I'll have to watch that one again, but this one honestly could top it in my eyes.",jdshnp
g9e4ozo,timestamp? i must have missed it!,jdshnp
g9b2437,">I don’t doubt Lee likes to be on Broadway in someway.

Quite, given that this isn't the first unorthodox Broadway show that he has filmed.",jdshnp
g9gyan0,"I'm not sure it delivered anything we didn't already know.

It didn't add anything emotionally for me that I hadn't felt in other parts of the performance.

It was incongruous, for the reasons I outlined above.

The people in the audience weren't seeing what we were seeing. It felt shoehorned in. Actually, it felt plastered on, obscuring the performance.

I couldn't read all the names, dates that were in front of me and listen to the words, or take in all the names in red. The song is meant to be about clarity, about not missing, overlooking, or being overwhelmed, it's trying to draw attention to the individuals. But the effect of the photos and words was the opposite. I felt it was very heavy handed.

I don't think people who watch this are going to need convincing.",jdshnp
g9csihj,"Dang,too good to be true.",jdshnp
g9bmm81,"Not for directing or film,it was for wrirung.",jdshnp
g9ebgca,Ok...it wasn't really her. It just looked like her :),jdshnp
g9bzazl,"> thus giving Spike Lee his 1st win for a film.

He won for writing...writing a film. All Oscars are for films, and he has already won. Would def be great to see him land a Best Director or Best Pic (or even Best Doc, I suppose) at some point though.",jdshnp
