dac2ws9,When Moana looks back at the island after sailing away and the light from the hut her Grandmother was in goes out and then travels to the sea in the form of a stingray....most beautiful depiction of a character passing. ,5ef0j8
dabykyl,"This might be one of the prettiest looking films I've ever seen. The hair, the water and everything else looked so dang good.

Also I am never gonna get ""You're Welcome"" out of my head",5ef0j8
dabzxjw,Maui! I've come to bargain!,5ef0j8
dac4zg8,"""If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.""
Love Disney meta humor


Goddamn, this movie is pretty. The latter half of ""You're Welcome"" and ""Shiny"" are gorgeous to watch!",5ef0j8
dac4hbh,Stacking that shell really screws it up for the next person. ,5ef0j8
dac4k5c,Baby Moana meeting the sea has quickly become one of my favorite scenes of the year. ,5ef0j8
dac27sh,The chicken provided quality comedic relief without being overbearing. 10 piece chicken nuggets/10,5ef0j8
dac0h30,Loved the quick Sven cameo when Maui couldn't get the hook to work ,5ef0j8
dabzzq0,This movie was absolutely gorgeous. The scene when Moana finally sets off on her journey and her grandma's sprit is guiding her was the first time I realized that this was gonna be one special movie.,5ef0j8
dadib5i,That crab got fucking freaky when he went bio-luminescent.  I even saw a few kids in the theater a little unnerved at that.,5ef0j8
dabyekn,"The coconut pirates was definitely a Mad Max reference right?  The whole movie was amazing, I loved when the Grandma comes back to guide Moana, definitely one of the highlights.   The animation as Tehiti(?) crawls to Moana floored me, as did all of the villians, especially Teca's fireballs and magma hands. Hei Hei and Maui's tattoo were great side characters as well.",5ef0j8
dad4on3,"Am I the only one shocked to know that Auli'i Cravalho is only 16? I guessed early twenties but nope, sixteen! That's incredible. I hope she has a great career going forward. Loved her voice acting in this.",5ef0j8
dac1x79,My only complaint: not enough pig. ,5ef0j8
dame32q,"I'm gonna take a second to appreciate something I haven't seen mentioned: The sailing. Seriously, it's so well done. The terminology was all correct, they tied proper bowline knots, the way the boats moved and reacted to waves felt natural, and the movie gave the feeling of sailing: the wind in your hair, the feeling of the speed and how in tune you feel with your boat when your start going. It's been years that I haven't sailed and this movie brought on some serious nostalgia.",5ef0j8
dalsf24,"Totally in love with this movie.  Disney is on a roll! Great characters, powerful girl main character who's not into a guy, the Rock was funny, LMM's awesome score, realistic depiction of Island culture, funny animal sidekick who's not overtly annoying, a pretty AWESOME ending for a disney animation.  This is my favorite Disney movie by far.  Will be taking my kids to see it again this weekend.  

Also like to point out - Moana is the MOST Princess-like character out of all disney princess movies.  I mean she's actually acting CHIEF before she sets out; serving administrative and political functions.   She was meant take over too, and no one was asking her to get married to some guy.   And her line near the end: [""Let her come to me"", is the most royal, regal, majestic thing a Disney character has ever said.  She basically ordered the Ocean to part the sea like Moses, and then made an angry balrog-like villain crawl TO her so SHE can give her blessing to it and save the day.](#spoiler) WOW.  Now that's a REAL BAD ASS Royalty or GODDESS talking.   I love this movie.

Edit: corrected the quote.",5ef0j8
dabxsts,"Can we talk about how Disney tackles mature themes in a style akin to Pixar in their prime?

I loved that they tackled the idea that tragedy tends to rob people of who they are, and in a way this movie is about allowing yourself to be made whole again",5ef0j8
daby5zm,"Tamatoa singing ""Shiny"" stole the show for me. The animation and music made it one of my favorite villain songs ever.

Also, the Kakamora/Mad Max parallels were hilarious!",5ef0j8
dac2ppg,"The opening sequence with baby Moana in the ocean was breathtaking. Though honestly the whole movie was beautiful. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the food from the beginning to the end, and not having a love interest made it even better for me. Definitely would recommend it to anyone. ",5ef0j8
dac1snl,"I WAS A MESS. 
The scenes when Moana first left were the most powerful scenes. Even my son, who hardly shows emotion during shows, was getting glossy eyed. 

Definitely going to try to get everyone I love to watch this! 


This movie made me SO proud to be a Pacific Islander. ",5ef0j8
dac3ba1,"What are people's thoughts on Zootopia vs. Moana? I think Zootopia's message was sharper, but Moana will be talked about longer thanks to soundtrack, broader appeal, and ultimately checking more of the classic Disney (and, Hero's Journey) boxes. I'm personally hoping Lin Manuel sticks around for something just a little more focused with Disney, but really seems Disney's on fire either way.",5ef0j8
dacb0no,"""I Am Moana"" had no business being as powerful a song/scene as it was. I seriously got chills watching it.  ",5ef0j8
dac4jo8,"You shut the fuck up right now if you disagree that ""You're Welcome"" isn't the best song of 2016. ",5ef0j8
dabz3da,Disney can do no wrong at this point. They just print money,5ef0j8
dad2x8r,Was getting some serious Bilbo Baggins / Smaug vibes from Moana and the shiny crab. ,5ef0j8
dadlnh3,"I may be a bit bias, but feel compelled to share this with you all when I say this was an incredible movie to me and particularly emotional one too. As a Samoan/Hawaiian, there are principles and values that are central to our Pacific Culture that for many years I've tried to share with anyone I meet. This story really brought many of those values out to the larger screen, to a larger audience, and I didn't realize seeing it this way would affect me so.  When baby Moana first stepped onto that beach in the early part of the movie... ""the feels"" are an understatement.  We were crying openly as if seeing a reflection of our own childhood on a beach in Samoa and in Hawaii -- the happiness, the curiosity, the sea.

The story of the Polynesians voyaging across the Pacific; the sense of ohana and family; how important coconuts are to island life; how the island provides all you need; sense of duty to go out and seek solutions and bring them home; chickens and pigs all over the place (!); the beautiful and varied languages; the dancing; the art and craft of the tapestries (tapa/capa cloth) and other designs; the canoe designs; the laughing; the relationship with the ocean.... these are all real things we as Pacific Islanders feel in a beautiful, unique life. 

This was a well done movie. Disney deserves credit for bringing so much joy and pride to a people that are often associated with tikis and grass skirts... We are so much more, and the story told herein gives a taste. 

4/4 stars. 10/10.  Thumbs.  Fresh tomatoes.  Etc :-)",5ef0j8
dam71oe,That opening scene with Baby Moana meeting the ocean is the cutest thing you'll see all year,5ef0j8
dac09vv,"For the first time in a long time for me, I wanted MORE songs in the movie. Not sure if it's Lin or my love of Hawaiian/Polynesian music. As opposed to most others (I imagine) ""You're Welcome"" was my least favorite song. ",5ef0j8
daj04fc,Who else loved the Kokomora? Murdering little pirates. ,5ef0j8
daidzpc,"HEY!

WHAT CAN I SAYYYYY EXCEPT,

***YOU'RE WELCOME!!***",5ef0j8
daqofk4,"I loved how Te Fiti became a lava and earth demon. 

Because lava and earth can be the basis of rich, fertile land and new life. Which is exactly what happened when she got the heart back.",5ef0j8
daep0id,I love the music. I'm a huge Hamilton nerd and you can hear Lin-Manuel Miranda's influences in more places than just the rap verse in You're Welcome.,5ef0j8
dac0pnf,"Really enjoyed the movie, here's a few things:

1. Jesus dude, the animation looks absolutely fucking phenomenal. The hair/water/sand/etc physics hnnngh 

2. Fuck that four-armed head-turning monster, thing of nightmares. 

3. Shit got real when crabguy exposed the tattoo of Maui's parents throwing him away. 

4. My biggest gripe with the movie would be the amount of toys and related things it will spawn as Frozen did.

All in all, fun and gorgeous film. Recommended. ",5ef0j8
dabytqr,"The movie was great but what I'm so happy with is the fact it had no love interest what so ever. So refreshing in a Disney princess movie. I instantly fell in love with Moana. Quite possibly my favorite Disney princess now. 

Edit: Disney princess movie",5ef0j8
dac7ps2,"I felt like Moana was a great example of how to portray a feminist character.  In the movie, her gender is NOT made a big deal.  She's not a hero, IN SPITE of her gender, she's just a hero.  It's never once doubted that she's confident, capable, and a leader.  I felt like it would have been really easy for Disney to have made a plot along the lines of ""I should be the next chief, but I'm a girl so people doubt me."" Instead they focused on Moana's conflicting desires with those of her people, which is a much more interesting conflict.  Very well done overall.",5ef0j8
dabye3r,"So this movie kind of accidentally pairs up with Kubo and the Two Strings. It hits a lot of the same beats, eye instead of heart, giant weapon covered skeleton instead of giant glitter covered crab.

Music was superb and I loved the subtle deconstruction/parody of the usual Disney formula.

My favorite moment of the entire movie was Moana grabbing provisions and her mother spotting her, tearing up and helping. 6 seconds of film carried so much power and emotion.",5ef0j8
dac4h5g,"What happened to Moana's father happened to three friends of mine this summer. Only one of them survived.

I miss you guys. I hope the afterlife is wonderful for you, and I hope I see you guys again one day. Rest in peace.",5ef0j8
dagij6u,"""My name is Inigo Montoya, you will board my boat and return the heart to Te-Fiti"" 
I got that vibe from her repetition. Also solid Mad Max shout out, Godzilla easter egg, and several others that have been mentioned. Absolutely enjoyed this one. Lin Manuela Miranda definitely shined in a lot of the songs he wrote.",5ef0j8
daebj7u,"> Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome

>'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

>I'm sailing away, away

>You're welcome!

>'Cause Maui can do anything but float


Biggest laugh in the movie for me.    ",5ef0j8
dabxzvg,"The water animation, dude. Stunning.",5ef0j8
dag1xgq,"Here's an idea for a Moana sequel from the Maori tradition (NSFW): 

>In Māori mythology, Māui is a culture hero famous for his exploits and his trickery.
His last, fatal trick was on the Goddess Hine-nui-te-pō. In attempting to make mankind immortal by changing into a worm, entering her vagina and leaving by her mouth while she slept, she crushed him with the obsidian teeth in her vagina.",5ef0j8
daij7jb,Did anybody catch that Maui shapeshifted into Sven from Frozen for a split second? ,5ef0j8
daf6wdl,Yo dat island god lady was low key thicc,5ef0j8
daic291,"Am I the only one who kept hearing Moana's home island as ""Mata Nui""? 

Sure, Bionicle mined a lot of it's early lore from Polynesian culture, but it was still amusing to hear. ",5ef0j8
daeygnz,"I saw this with my girlfriend last night. It's one of the best of the year. 

What really got me was the grandmother giving Moana the strength to go on and not quit, turning into a stingray and always being there in spirit. My girlfriend's mother passed three years ago when my girlfriend was about 15 and she told me in a way she can relate to Moana and that she believes her mother gives her the power to go through life as she watches her. I gave her a big hug and started tearing. It got to me bad.

I love this film so much. 

edit: also very sad many are not supporting this movie due to the whole Hamilton fiasco. Pitiful.",5ef0j8
dac4wxo,"My personal verdict: A solid 8.5/10. What a great movie.


**The Good:**


- The Pacific and Polynesian theme/style direction. My god does the film look gorgeous and a majority of the soundtrack sounds so beautiful. The islands of the Pacific and the ocean as a whole is a backdrop that I feel is just *perfect* for animated movies due to its color and vibrance, but not a lot of animated movies have taken advantage of that. There is Moana, then Lilo and Stitch, Finding Nemo/Dory (Kind of), and both Spongebob Squarepants movies (Kind of). The rich vibrant colors of the green islands contrasting with the wide expansive blue is just so impressive to look at. Same goes for the music, which a lot of it was styled after a very Polynesian theme. Lots of uses of the beautiful chanting chorus as well as the heavy beats of drums combined with the pretty scenery just makes for a great movie.


- Moana herself. She has become one of my favorite Disney Princesses...if you can call her a Princess that is. I suspect Disney marketing will count her as such and I will too. She is the next up in a long line of strong independent Princess leads that has started to crop up, but personally to me I feel Moana is the strongest out of all of them. The way they handled her character (As well as poke fun and subvert the princess tropes of yore) has really escalated herself up into the ranks as some of the best.


- The [*""We Know the Way""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOwVQvAIK-k) song sequence. Oh my god, this part gave me so many chills down my spine. So many chills. To those who need remembering, the sequence is when Moana hits the drum and learns about her people's past through the musical montage of her ancestors sailing the high seas in search of new lands. That whole montage is so fucking beautiful to look at, and the music that accompanies it just makes it feel so much more awesome. The chanting, the drum beats, it is such a great musical montage sequence and has become my favorite part of the movie as a whole.


- Fridge Brilliance (Spoilers): The fact that Te Ka and Te Fiti are both the same goddess. At first I thought it was a rather cheapish cop out when Moana saw the spiral in Te Ka's chest went ahead to place the stone in it. It didn't click in my head until I saw Te Fiti's hand sprout green plants into the ground and I saw the brilliant reason as to why that was; in the Pacific Islands, volcanoes bring both life and death. Where a volcano erupts and the lava flow runs across the land, it destroys everything in its path. But when the flow hardens, it leaves behind nutrient rich soil and soon enough plant and animal life begins to prosper where the destruction once was. I thought that was utterly brilliant.


**The Bad**


- Jemaine Clement's *""Shiny""* song. Sorry to those who rather enjoyed the segment, but that was a low point for me. I felt like it was just unnecessary. Why? It felt *really* out of place to me. In a beautiful soundtrack that was very much inspired by the rhythm and soul of Polynesian culture comes this really weird soft rockish type of song with disco ball-esque lighting and it's just really weird. It honestly felt like a knock off of Genie's song from Aladdin where it takes a musical stylistic approach that is vastly different from the other songs of the movie as well as be a means to be very comedic as well. What I *wish* would have happened is if Tamatoa was a cocky but distinguished crab god, with his song being in a style similar to the [Hawaiian War Chant](https://youtu.be/hQqdeOcd-Zo?t=757) from Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room where he sings and brags all about the treasures he has collected over the years and relates his tales of being awesome while collecting them. It would have given his song a lot of power with booming drums and chanting and actually make him feel *like* the 50 foot crab god he is and not just some throwaway villain.


- The pacing. Overall the movie has a great story, but there were moments where I felt the movie would cut too quickly (The first battle with Te Ka) or drag on forever (The *""Shiny*"" song) where some moments came and went so quick there wasn't really any time to relish upon them and some moments that would linger of for so long that they felt like they overstayed their welcome. The entire movie wasn't like this, but there were definitively moments of that here and there.


Overall, Moana is definitively a fantastic movie that people should go out to see. It has its problems but I still feel it is a really strong product and a great great great addition to the Disney film lineup.


Side note: For those who got it, did anyone find the trailer for Hidden Figures a really odd choice of trailer for this movie? It's wedged in between the new Smurfs movie trailer and the LEGO Batman trailer. You honestly couldn't get a weirder trailer if you could. A better choice honestly would have been the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer in its place. Not only would it promote more Disney material, but its light and peppy tone would better suit the other trailers instead of a biographical film about three African-American women working at NASA for the Apollo Missions.


**EDIT:** I actually wonder how well Moana would have done if it was released in the 1960's when the popularity of Polynesian Culture was at its peak in the United States. I am just assuming it would have been a massive hit and been cemented as a Disney classic. Just a pure shower thought there...",5ef0j8
dabxyp8,"The animation was stunning! I can't get over how beautiful it was!
Edit: There IS a small after credits scene! Stay until the end! ",5ef0j8
daipyej,"One of my favorite things was that you could see the fishing hook when he was an animal

It was on his wings as a bird.  That kind of consistency does things for me",5ef0j8
dayxq4t,"This is mad late, but the scene where Maui is facing up to the lava monster, hook destroyed, ready to sacrifice his life for Moana was so bad ass. he knew he was going to die, and he stared into the eyes of death as a warrior. ",5ef0j8

dae18kp,"Saw this with my gf last night. The scene where the grandmother dies but continues on as a glowing ray was one of the most beautiful movie moments I've seen all year.

Her grandmother and her ancestors appearing later on in spirit was beautiful as well.",5ef0j8
daem8c5,"This movie felt super emotional at times just through the subtext of the visuals. Did not expect that. Usually popcorn movies tell you or cue you in when you're supposed to feel a certain thing, but this movie had moments that just made me well up spontaneously. 

I thought the first act was the best, followed by the third. The middle could have been better.",5ef0j8
dak0hpb,I hate to sound a little perverted here but did anyone notice how Moana's body differed from other Disney female leads? Her arms and legs seemed to be a little thicker than the usual Disney princesses and thought that may have been to make her a little stronger looking since she's dealing with circumstances such as climbing a mountain and fighting coconut pirates. If that is the reason I really appreciated that small change.,5ef0j8
dam91wm,"One of the little things I absolutely loved about this movie was that there were no bad guys. Absolutely none. The only evil that was in the movie was greed and bitterness personified as Tamatoa and [Tefiti](#spoiler). Sure, Moana's parents are against her sailing but they aren't backwards or wrong. The song ""Where You Are"" had a great message about finding happiness in the present. They weren't wrong in the same way that Maui wasn't wrong. He did what he did to help humanity. In addition, Maui's mistake would only have made him a bad guy if he didn't correct it. That sends a great message that mistakes are only bad if you don't make good. For a thousand years, Maui didn't correct his and his legacy was ruined. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the music (minus ""Shiny"", let's just ignore that one). The animation itself was drop dead gorgeous. The cast was fantastic and I loved that they had the cast sing their own songs rather than having a weird Judy Kuhn situation. The representation of Polynesian culture and practice was awesome and really made a lot of people feel empowered. The messages of self-acceptance, finding beauty in the present, following your heart, and make mistakes to learn were excellent choices by the writers. Really happy with the end result. Would like the watch it again.",5ef0j8
damccov,"Damn, I didn't think anyone was in such agreement about the crab scene being awful. I'm not a huge Disney fan but that scene was one of my favorite. The song is weird at first but it quickly became really funny to me for some reason. It reveals a part of Maui's past, the glow in the dark visuals are cool and it reinforces the whole greed thing. No real strikes from me as far as story telling and song-writing(like i said, not a huge Disney fan, but here i am on the Moana soundtrack on spotify). 9/10",5ef0j8
dac0quw,"""How Far I'll Go"" is going to be stuck in my head for the next week, isn't it?",5ef0j8
dcjumvg,"All I could think of during the scene when Maui kept pushing Moana off the boat was ""Dormammu, I've come to bargain.""",5ef0j8
dac6juu,The coconut pirate scene reminded me of Mad Max a bit,5ef0j8
dac0o8o,"I loved the unholy crap out of this movie... but I personally felt Maui's big return in Act III was out of nowhere. 

I would have personally had an extra scene, showing him visiting the gods that rescued him and gave him his powers, asking them why they did it. To which they'd basically reiterate Moana's argument from before, and this is what makes him realize she deserves his help. 

I know they wanted his return to be a surprise for the audience, but frankly, anyone with a basic understanding of storytelling knows he'd come back, so it's already a predictable plot moment. They could have at least subverted that, by having Maui's change of heart be an opportunity for more excellent drama. 

As it is, it feels like there's an entire scene missing, and Maui is suddenly completely cool with things after his tantrum earlier? As an aspiring screenwriter, I'd handle that differently. 

But, hey.... otherwise LOVE this movie. ",5ef0j8
dacx7m5,"""The story was nothing new"" - that's true, but sometimes you don't need something ridiculously fancy. I don't consider that a detriment because it did liven up the old tropes.

Moana wasn't a girl who didn't want the ruling responsibility - because of an ancestral calling within her, she knew that she had to take on another part of Chiefdom responsibility that had been ignored.

I'm surprised at how much of the humor didn't land for me. It's not a detriment, because there's so much heart and love, but Zootopia was funnier.",5ef0j8
damz3vz,"This movie had an excellent soundtrack and gorgeous visuals 10/10. My only criticism is that there was no purpose for that pig except to sell toys. The promotional posters were definitely misleading on that. On the other hand, Hei Hei the rooster was great! I always smile now imagining Alan Tudyk making rooster sounds into a mic! ",5ef0j8
ddkldf0,"I love this film a heck lot! I'm a Pacific islander as well and although I'm Melanesian and the film was centered around Polynesian culture, I Absolutely LOVE IT!

There are a good number of similarities in our culture and it just makes me so happy and proud seeing the first Pacific Island Disney princess!

It was very personal for me watching it as well, the bond Moana shared with her grandma, reminded me of my own grandmother and I. Things really changed since her passing but she's always wanted me to excel in all I do. She always had time for me and I was much closer to her than my own parents.

I cried each and every time Moana sang ""How Far I'll Go"", especially when her grandma died and when she met her in spirit form. We believe in our ancestors and blood relatives watching over us from the spirit realm. And I always know and feel my grandmother's still around me. Today, February 10th is the anniversary of the day she died (in 2013) so I decided to watch Moana once more and I never get sick of it.❤

I just love this movie with all my heart and soul...💕",5ef0j8
dadhqot,"Two of my favorite scenes: The scene where Moana first meets the ocean. The visuals were absolutely stunning and the music complimented it perfectly. The second one near the end where she's walking towards Te Fiti singing that same song but in English and it all just comes together. I got goosebumps. I cried a little. My family and I booked out the whole showing tonight and when it ended, we all walked just stunned at how beautifully our people's music and culture were portrayed in the film. Great movie. ",5ef0j8

daeopw7,"I thought Moana was perfect. Top to bottom I cannot come up with a single nitpick or critique beyond ""Disney formula"". I can't even be mad at that because even then it doesn't adhere to it entirely. 

Sure it hit all the story points (the ""I want"" song, random upbeat number from a side villain, etc), but the differences are great. She's a princess but she's also the heir to the throne and is being taught to be a great leader to he people. It's part of her hero's journey. No focus on a love interest at all. That final ""villain"" moment was beautifully executed and unexpected. Not only was it stunning to look at, but the movement in the music and the revelation of who the monster was is one of the strongest moments in any Disney film ever. I was scared she would talk for a moment but I'm so so glad they didn't go that route. 

The music. Just wow. When your weakest song is a Flight of the Concords track, then you know it's excellent. It's on par with Beauty and the Beast. So many moments had me either tearing up or laughing hard (You're Welcome especially).  Lin Manuel-Miranda is the next Menken  if he keeps this up. 


This may be hyperbole because I just saw it an hour ago, but right now it's a 9.5/10. It's better than Tangled and Frozen. It's Disney's best Princess movie since Beauty and the Beast. Holy crap Disney made 2016 its bitch

dcaj48k,"I'd rate this above Zootopia (but maybe that's because I haven't seen Zootopia since the first time earlier in 2016). Moana did a lot more with fewer characters than Zootopia and felt less... artificial? Zootopia screamed out that it was a quirky Disney flick while Moana felt more drawn in and it made the big moments that much more impressive. The beautiful water and the sparkling images were really well done. 

The chemistry between Moana and Maui was fun and Maui himself was a great character. Doing a War Dance when faced with certain lava death was pretty great. I almost shed a tear with the Grandma. I don't remember many cartoons making me feel that emotional in of 2016. ",5ef0j8

dai4xp7,"Loved it. Was happy to see that, while it has the Disney princess fantasy musical formula, they did a lot of things differently than in their past movies. Moana is a ""royal"", but she actually does work and practices leadership skills. I hate when movie princesses don't do anything beyond wear fancy dresses and sing about how they want adventure. It was nice to see a world inspired by cultures we don't see very often in movies. I like that it had more of an action/adventure feel than other female-led Disney films.",5ef0j8

dbhf7nd,"I think this was easily the best computer generated film Disney has ever made and is absolutely up there with the Disney greats.

Pros:

One of the undisputable great elements of the film is its animation which is absolutely stunning.  I could make at least 20 different beautiful desktop backgrounds from this film and y'all best know I will.

The characters were all fantastic and the dynamic between Maui and Moana was great with each event pushing their great arcs just a little further. Their dynamic was not only great in dialogue but also in action as in each conflict they go through both characters work off each other and improve in doing so throughout the film. 

The soundtrack was spectacular,  you know I'll be downloading all of these songs. 

One of the things that sets this film apart from other Disney films is its use of  a female protagonist in that in the many recent Disney films which have been all ""Yeah, look how strong I am,  you wouldn't think that of a woman!""  and this has felt really shoehammered into the film. This wasn't the case of Moana as the film didn't make a big deal of how bad ass she was,  it just made her bad ass. Moana and her determination was the driving force of the movie and the whole thing felt very natural as opposed to a ""strong female protagonist""  bouncing around between situations in which they can show those who doubted them how strong they are. 

Cons:
The coconut pirates very much felt like they needed someone to attack the ship and some producer said ""You see those guys who attack the boat. Two words: coconut minions"". The attack itself was very well done but there was little to no reason for the characters actually being coconuts. 

While I absolutely adore Jermaine Clement and loved the crabs song basically just before it was like a bonus flight of the conchordes song (yes please)  it seriously didn't fit in with the rest of the film.  I loved it but the whole thing was like

Moana-Moana-Moana-Flight of the Conchordes-Moana

Now don't get me wrong,  I bloody loved it,  but dear god did it break the flow. 

That said the pros so heavily outweighed the cons it was an absolutely stunning experience and I know I'll gladly watch it again sometime in the near future. ",5ef0j8
dcgwk0n,"Okay I was reading through the thread and not many other people have noticed it, but when Moana goes to restore the heart of Te Fiti, she clearly puts Hei Hei in the basket and then in the boat (to make sure he stays safe while she goes up against Te Ka) but then there is the scene where she almost drops the heart into the ocean and Hei Hei (who is still in the basket in the boat) comes out of nowhere and saves the heart and gives it to Moana.

Now there are two things that could've happened:
1. It could be an animator mistake
OR
2. It's Maui and he didn't actually leave when he left Moana on the boat before she sees her grandma, and he really just watched over her from a distance to make sure she stay safe or something like that around that vicinity.

",5ef0j8
de7d5bu,"This may be my second-favorite Disney movie ever, after Lilo&Stitch. 

Every review, even the negative ones, mentions that it's visually stunning, so let's skip over that part. The songs! I have no idea what anyone hears in the songs in *Frozen*; I thought those were bland and forgettable. I'm not even very fond of musicals, but I liked every song in *Moana* and I could sing *How Far I’ll Go* after hearing it once. The scene where she finds her confidence again made me cry; it was a perfect blend of well-timed songs and plot/action. Also, I generally hate comic-relief sidekicks (the bumbling aliens were the worst part about the aforementioned Lilo&Stitch), but I really liked the chicken. The movie made me laugh several times, which is remarkable because I'm a grump who doesn't like the style of most comedies these days. All in all, highly recommended.

Minuses: The crab and coconuts were just ok.",5ef0j8
daizgkz,"I got the impression that the two animal sidekicks were the two sides of Moana... The pig represented her island and her people, none of whom would leave the island, mostly due to fear.  The chicken was her love of the ocean and need to explore it and go to places unseen, which requires a bit of crazy or outright stupidity.",5ef0j8

daeqqj7,"While it's not as complex or thematically stimulating as Zootopia, it's still very good. There's nothing wrong with a more simple story.

- Moana is a great character. It's refreshing to see a different princess design. She's dark skin, black wavy hair, and with thicker body proportions.
- I never saw a single trailer or promo before tonight. I thought Maui was going to be a doofy sidekick, but he turned out to be the coolest guy.
- The plot breaks up the pacing with some interesting moments and scenes.
- The animation is incredible. Disney's hair and water technology has at its best here. Just beautiful. I cannot imagine how long it took to render all of this.
- I'm really enjoying these new Disney plots that aren't too straightforward. There's no ""rescue the princess and beat the evil bad guy"" here. Just more of a journey.
- The signature song ""How Far I'll Go"" is fantastic. Not as infectious as ""Let It Go"" but still very catchy.
- The dumb chicken gag was a little too much for me. So was the cute pig pet. Yeah, I get it, all Disney princesses need them but still.

By the way, the short in the beginning was too painful. I know it was supposed to be cute, but it hit too close to home and found myself tearing up.",5ef0j8

- It's gorgeous to look at. I don't think the ocean has ever looked that good. The lava monster was SO cool, and some of the wide shots made my jaw drop.

I thought Dwayne Johnson was just OK, but ""You're Welcome"" is really catchy. My favourite, though, is ""We Know the Way."" It's beautiful. 

- I would have liked to see more of the pig. I think he'd have been more interesting as a sidekick than the chicken. ",5ef0j8

I also have a Hei matau that is 300ish years old and got it on, wait for it, Maui. So, long story short, we loved this movie and my kids are even more obsessed with Maui than ever before. They want my necklace too, but, like the man himself, it ain't happening. I was worried when I heard the early drafts were full of stereotypes, but I thought they did a great job and several parts gave me goosbumps for sure. I love that they made Maui comical too and not the great demigod he's often portrayed as. Disney does a good job of sort of respectfully caricaturing big characters like that.

The movie Maui did have these qualities but his character was often used as comic relief (blow dart to the butt, messing up his transformations when shape shifting).

I agree that the crew behind the film took great care and concern when making this film. There are references to my culture - as well as many other Polynesian cultures - that are integrated so masterfully into the film.

I live in a city with the highest percentage of Māori people in New Zealand and I can definitely say that Moana has been well received among the people here. The production crew should be very proud of the way they have been able to portray our culture(s) with accuracy and authenticity.

Went into the film blind apart from the knowledge of it being a Disney film. It delivered in the aspect of the animation, visually the most stunning film I've ever seen, tons of Screenshot worthy scenes and at ~~some~~ many parts of the film I was amazed by the detail of the animations.

Plot wise, preetty cookie cutter. Similarly to my last movie, Sing, pretty predictable in many parts, though this one has many more moments where you go ""oh, I didn't exactly expect that"". One of those films where you would be fine with watching, but there really isn't much to dig by watching it again, too little depth and things just happen because it has to without much purpose.

Can't comment on the songs since I never liked musical segments in every film I've ever watched anyway.

db3k0ny,"Moana

This movie is so frustratingly close to being perfect. As so many people have said so far, it has great animation and a great soundtrack. Overall, great family entertainment. Here are some thoughts (because I need to vent).

Thoughts (with spoilers).

1) **Amazing music - not always amazing choreography.** I love this soundtrack. It's already stuck in my head. I found myself wanting more movement at times. A few times in the movie, Moana feels like a broadway musical, where there are just two characters standing and singing to each other. This is fine, but it makes me think of moments like the Lion King's ""Be Prepared,"" where the grand scale of Scar's plans is played out in the background, or ""Just Can't Wait to Be King"" where Simba runs through alligators and stuff. When Moana is just standing and singing, I feel like there are times where we could be seeing more in the background.

2) **Almost too much broadway.** There are moments in the movie that are VERY POWERFUL - like the very first time that Moana sees [her grandmother's manta ray rush through the water](#spoiler). Amazing moment - but I think it would have been fine to let the instrumentals do their work. When she breaks out into song, I think it decreases the raw power of that surprise and cuts the emotion a little bit short.

3) **The entire sequence with the coconut pirates is perfect for me.** I personally loved it. I laughed. I snorted. People in the theater looked at me. No complaints.

4) **Dead characters shouldn't talk so much.** In The Lion King, Mufasa's appearance in the clouds was powerful because it was so short. Mufasa didn't need an additional musical number. The power of it was in the surprise and the relative quickness of the scene. In Moana they didn't go for that, which is fine. Instead of doing an ultra-powerful, epic, spritual moment, they did something different. The spiritual moment was quieter, comforting (which was very cute), but also a little bit too long. I think it takes a little bit of the mystery away from the spirit world when spirits talk for a long time.

5) That being said, [""Is there something you want to tell me?"", ""Is there something you want to hear?""](#spoiler) - very simple, maybe even done before, but just perfect for that moment, early in the movie. Almost cried. I cry at odd moments; my family tells me that I'm weird.

6) **Near the end, Moana has to fix her boat, and I wish they had done things in a different order.** There's a musical number, [she makes her big choice, sees all these visions then fixes the boat](#spoiler). WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME is if [she went through all her problems on her own, sang about how lonely she was (cause she's at the bottom), had a brief vision of her grandmother to push her forward, sang one final line, made her choice to go get the green thing, and THEN FIX THE BOAT. And then as she's sailing THAT'S WHEN HER BOAT IS OVERTAKEN BY THE BOATS OF HER ANCESTORS AND THEY SAIL WITH HER ALL THE WAY TO THE VOLCANO MONSTER. And then just before they get to the island, the boats fade away and she's alone again BUT WE GOT MOMENTUM NOW BOYS. Ugh, in my mind that works so well](#spoiler).

7) **I personally didn't need Moana to sing in the slow-motion section at the end.** When the movie went slow-motion, it actually took my breath away - but when she started singing it broke the moment for me. I think that final action is visually and emotionally powerful, so to have her sing at that moment was again too broadway. On a stage this would be a great moment for a song. In a movie, it isn't entirely needed.

Really fun movie overall though. I think I just get caught up with my wish lists. The Rock has a pretty nice singing voice too. Okay, I think I'm good. I think I can move on with my life.

db7zde7,"Movie was excellent, 7/10 easy.  
The plot was good, the cast was good, and the music was excellent. 

The issues I had were with the crab, the goddess, and the water. 

The giant crab felt like an unnecessary character that was forced into the film.  There was no legwork done to connect his character to the Pacific Islander Mythology.  His design and appearance also conflicted with the overall look and feel of Moana. His song was also entirely irrelevant to the plot and story. 

The lava monster/ goddess connection was very weak.  The premise of lava creating islands being represented as a split personality was clever, but execution was not good enough.  [It was almost deus ex machina how the end boss you could not beat just happened to be the person you needed to find.](#spoiler) There was no legwork done on the part of the movie to explain how or why [the goddess lost her mind post the removal of the heart](#spoiler).  There was also no explanation as to why [the goddess got her sanity back right when Moana realised who she was.](#spoiler)

The last issue is with the water.  It is unclear if the ocean goddess, an ocean spirit, or a liquid pet was the character being personified.  This thing has [Moses level](#spoiler) powers but somehow played a non-consequential role throughout the film.",5ef0j8

danmxrb,"In the deluxe soundtrack you can find two outtakes (More and it's reprise) that was replaced by How Far I'll Go (and it's respective reprise). I'm curious as to why that was. Was it not catchy enough to be a single? Maybe the song was too specific to the story, and Disney wanted a radio-ready single with vague lyrics; that has always been the case since The Little Mermaid.

It has to be easy to sing to so that it can top the charts. If you listen, More is definitely a lot more complex in lyric structure than How Far I'll Go. I guess Lin-Manuel had to make compromises since at the end of the day Disney needed another Let It Go, and More just didn't cut it.",5ef0j8

dau2g4n,"I was a bit whatever on this one.

Visually gorgeous, but it REALLY felt like it was originally a movie about Maui, like a kind of Hercules story about a fall from grace and rising back up, but they added in Moana and everything else late stage (the Jemaine crab, for example, feels like a boss from an earlier version of the movie). Two animal sidekicks, and you only get one for brief moments at the beginning and at the end? 

There is literally no reason for Maui to help her. Yeah, his tattoo wants him to, and yeah it's the ""right"" thing to do, but dramatically there's just no reason for it, and the setup of ""so humans will worship you again"" is super weak especially if in the end they don't depict, well, any humans worshiping him. 

Also I don't buy the whole ""she sucks at sailing"" thing. It robs her of an interesting characteristic. As is, she's just a useless character who needs another character to help her complete her journey.

It also suffers from what I call ""video game checkpoint"" plotting - Maui has to get his fish hook back, and then they will go to fight the end boss. So he does get it, and they suffer no consequences from it. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have the hook damaged as a result of the crab, rather than later?

I also get the whole idea of ""who you really are"" as a baseline theme, but just didn't feel like it was sufficiently setup throughout the movie, so the big payoff didn't land for me.

That being said, absolutely a gorgeous movie. Jaw dropped when they switched to slow motion action and real-time singing of that final song too.",5ef0j8

dadzcrq,"I loved the movie, I loved the songs, they choked me up because they were very emotional.

Some things felt forced, like the chicken was funny, but he was shoe-horned in a way that didn't fit with the story. An example of comedy that worked with the story was Maui turning into a shark. Moana also made a big show of greeting her pet pig when she returned to her island, and I know us modern people make a big deal of our pets, but I would imagine a girl like Moana living in an island community would have greeted her friends and fellow islanders first. It felt like a way to remind us to buy a stuffed Pua toy. It worked, because I remember his name! 

The last thing that felt forced to me was the resolution of Moana's conflict. She's wondering why she was chosen by the ocean and the answer is... unclear to me. I don't know if anyone can help me. She thinks she's not up for the task and then she screams ""I Am Moana"" and that gives her resolve. What is it that made her special? Is it just ""being herself""? Who is she exactly? She's the daughter of a chief and a girl who loves the ocean... is that really enough? It just felt a bit cringy that she ends her song by screaming her name, like it's a bit too cliché and empty.

It was refreshing to see a platonic relationship instead of a romantic one. but the rest of the plot from a rebellious heroine wanting more than what home provides to a loved one dying and meeting again in a spiritual sense and so on has been done by Disney (and other studios) many times before, and in my opinion better.

dbl40cv,"That's a good point - and I agree it's more about the beginning. Children's movies do have a way of glossing over potentially dark moments (Finding Dory, after a certain age, becomes a parable about taking care of someone with Alzheimer's pretty much), which might even be a thing we are afraid of these days, as opposed to wholeheartedly embracing the darker elements ala Grimm's original fairy tales (and even some older kids movies!)

I think for me ""reluctance"" isn't a bad trait for a character in a story to have and a good starting place for sure. But that changes at some point initially because there's a concrete reason to (otherwise you get, well, mopey characters). And I think it's stronger if that comes from internally and externally rather than externally only. I'm trying to think of examples of movies I liked where the initial reluctance isn't overcome by that - Luke for example is skeptical but internally he wants to see the universe and leave his dull life on Tattooine and externally the Empire kills his aunt and uncle. If you can think of any, I'd love to hear them.

In this case it felt like solely an external reason, because Maui, in addition to being deranged, really has every intention to peace out. I think after digesting the movie for this long, the two things I think it teased at but didn't really deliver on was a better interplay/dynamic between human and demigod, and better setup for the reveal at the end tying into the themes of ""who you really are."" Both of those fell flat for me.",5ef0j8

I feel like it was a little too standard in terms of its narrative; a girl who wants to get away from her father's expectations, when have we seen THAT in a Disney movie? The character who temporarily loses their faith but then returns later in the movie, unheard of! It was still executed well but it stood out so blatantly that it kind of bugged me.

Even though I liked the music, I actually feel like the movie would have been improved without any musical numbers; I feel like the story is more than sufficient to carry the entire movie without any interludes, and especially early on the songs drag the pacing down significantly.

This version acts as a theme song to the film. The film version appropriately sings How Far I'll Go as a song of yearning. There's still uncertainty in her voice. It's not until the Reprise and I Am Moana that it's sung with the proper gravitas, which makes the moments more powerful.

That said, this version by Janella Salvador is sung with the proper strength, with the proper energy of someone willing to go and sail, whereas Moana in the film is still hesitant when she's singing that song.

After she leaves the island, exactly two speaking-role characters are introduced. Two! It's was like My Dinner with Andre and Jermaine Clement is a crab-waiter who sings about how shiny the silverware is and then we never see him again. The chicken and the tattoo stick figure man were the worst sidekicks ever. Then I read how Maui is supposed to have this cool goddess-heroine companion in Polynesian mythology and that just twisted the knife deeper. Instead of an equal, someone who knows Maui and who can offer insight into his character, someone we can have a dialog with, and someone whose very inclusion would have given us a deeper understanding of Polynesian culture, we get this epidermal gingerbread man. I'm just stunned that this is how the movie turned out. I guess I expected more. More characters. More dialog. More chemistry. More locations. More waterbending. I rarely get out to the movies and after this one, I wish I had gone to see Harry Potter. I'm sad, guys. =(

My biggest pro: This movie was clearly made with love. Most vibrant CG animation to date. Distinctive music that brings something more to the table than just the usual power ballads. Every frame is bursting with creativity and craftsmanship.

My biggest con: Maui's motivations seemed all over the place. He styled himself a hero but attempted to literally leave Moana for dead on multiple occasions. What would have happened if he threw her into the ocean and the sea didn't save her? Would he have just listened to her screams fade over the horizon? See also: the boulder entombment.",5ef0j8

darweza,"I feel like I'm on crazy pills. People are praising this for things it didn't do (lack of love interest, not being disrespectful of cultures) rather than seeing its problems. 

Moana is easily the most boring movie Disney has made in a long time. The culture just isn't that interesting especially when everything gets dismissed so quickly. The coconut pirates have no explanation, don't hurt the heroes, and leave after a ten minute sequence. The crab is never mentioned again. The main villain's return to normal wasn't foreshadowed or hinted at in any way. And I know Disney has happy endings as their specialty, but if Zootopia worked the same way then the well-meaning lion would get out of jail and celebrated, and Nick would get his criminal record expunged in a formal ceremony. 

The worst thing without a doubt is the exposition. I'm not going to fault the beginning backstory as that's completely necessary, but come on. Think of the coconut pirates, The Chief's AND Maui's tragic backstory, all the stuff with the realm of monsters? Just characters talking and talking and talking. More sequences should have been in line with the amazing sequence that showed how their culture was wayfarers and voyagers, which needed no ""this is why blah blah blah.""

There's also only one good song (""Away We Go,"" which will win the Oscar if La La Land doesn't). The girl is trying but nothing is very memorable outside of Dwayne Johnson's number. And you can tell he doesn't sing. 

I don't hate this movie. It's gorgeous and there's a lot of fun sequences. But the love for this movie is nuts. Disney can do better, this isn't award-winning material. Lin Manuel Miranda doesn't even deserve an award for this movie either, which shocked me. 

In ten years, this will be looked at more like Pocahontas or Oliver & Company. It's an ""also-ran,"" not up with classics like Lion King or even Frozen. 

A 6/10, but a Disney 4/10.",5ef0j8
dabz0b8,"The singing and acting was great and the animation overall was stunning.  However, there are big story problems. Moana didn't grow as a character.  By the end of the first song, she is ready and able to become chief.  She is solving problems and accepting of her place until her Grandma ex machina butts in.  None of her labors/set pieces changes her or teaches her or prepares her in anyway for her final fight or ultimate responsibility.  You could have tossed out everything but Maui teaching her to sail and she would have been just as able to do the final fight and lead her people.  Grandma ex machina popping back up to lecture her at the end was as out of left field as her lecture at the beginning.

I love Moana the character, but Moana the movie is kind of pointless.",5ef0j8
dac3u6r,"If you're reading this, stop whatever you are doing and go see this film! ""Moana"" is an awesome tale of a young, daring woman who breaks tradition to save her island. The animation is vivid, expressive, and colorful. Voice acting, directing, and effects are excellent. However, what gives this film impact is the music. Mark Mancina, Opetaia Foa'i, and Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda are the engine of this film. Their scores breathe into film and allow it to captivate the audience. I sat in a film with crying kids and talkative adults. When ""How Far I'll Go"" started, the theater went silent. ""Moana"" is truly a superb film. 

There are some problems with the film but they are minor nitpicks. For one, the animation is not consistent and could feel choppy at times. Also, those who had seen Disney animated films during the 90s would have a sense of familiarity with the film's structure. 

Again, this film is really spectacular. Between ""Moana"" and ""Kubo"", the Academy will have headaches deciding which animated feature will receive the Oscar. Go and see this film. ",5ef0j8

dayj0hs,"For a Disney movie, I was so disappointed at the story. I don't know. The last most anticipated movies that I've been waiting for all year was disappointing to me. Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Theme and now Moana, too. Let's just hope that Assassin's Creed will make me happy before the year ends.
The most disappointed part about the movie was the story. I was expecting something complex. Some deep relations between the characters. The legendary co-directors John Musker and Ron Clement didn't give me the Disney story that I was looking forward to. Too much comedy was put into the movie making it too close to just a plain kids movie, meaning no adult can ever enjoy it. I expected better from the creators of Disney's legends Aladdin, Hercules and The Little Mermaid. The story was simple and predictable. I was trying so hard to ""love"" the characters and get attached, but they didn't give me a chance.

Another sad part is the music. One of the major things that got me excited to watch the movie was Tarzan's composer, Mark Mancina. Tarzan's film scores til this day are considered one of the most memorable and beloved soundtracks in Disney's history. I felt like... the songs were ""forced"" into this movie. The lyrics weren't that attractive and some characters' songs felt out of place. Disney... you could have at least brought Phil Collins along with Mark Mancina. Maybe things would have been much better. At least for the music side.

The only part that I ever enjoyed was the sea. The animation and the graphics just made me crazy. Excellent work!

They renamed the fucking main character. Moana is not an innuendo in Czech, it's much more of that in English. But for fucking reasons, they renamed her to Vaiana. Yup. No reason. The full name of the movie is as follows: *The brave Vaiana: The Legend of world's end*.

That moment ended up being its purpose and proved Moana was right to keep the chicken around. 
Then I was expecting some cheesy forced moment later where the chicken turns out to be smart all along, or do something intelligent and everyone takes note. But no, the chicken continued to be dumb and clueless. I just love that. Allowing the chicken to be lovable and important despite being dumb.

Not to mention I really liked his character in general. There was something very old-Disney about him that I enjoyed. I haven't heard a really good Disney villain song in a long time (and I don't count Hans' because we still thought he was a good guy when he was singing).",5ef0j8
damtvae,"The ""Shiny"" song actually touched in a really important theme at that point in the story - the conflict of where your identity comes from. Tamatoa crafted his identity superficially, shallowly... he criticizes Moana for thinking there's something inside her that tells her who she is, and confronts Maui with his tragedy (loss of identity) and points out their similarity, that they both define their identity through superficial things (Maui's tattoos, representing his achievements, being his 'skin deep' identity)

The song was not only fun, it was a vital foreshadowing of the central theme of the movie, the certainty of identity in the face of tragedy and self-doubt. It was the classic scene where the villain shows how their philosophy is great, how it'd be so easy and fun to give up and live life their way (he literally doesn't have to work to eat), and how the heroes have got it all wrong.

And while I agree the style was out of place, that was also a part of the theme, I think... it is more new age and less rooted in tradition than the more Polynesian inspired songs on the soundtrack, reflecting that Tamatoa is all flash and has forged a shallow identity with no history or family. He even ate his grandma!

Since most of the Moana movie-going demographic is children and families, doesn't hurt to stick in something educational amongst the fantasy and silly stuff. Parents can take their kid to watch Moana for a fun time and learn about Polynesian culture and then maybe next month teach them about space and US history, both movies can be inspiring and humanizing to a child.

Let’s have her be a more realistic body shape and feel like she’s not going to be blown over by a strong wind,’” Musker recalled.

Moana doesn't look that different size wise from the ""strong"" characters of any race (aside from the bug eyes of Elsa and slim features of Pocahontas) aside from two things.

1. Her ankles are thicker.  I think this is in reference to a genetic difference in how some groups including Pacific Islanders and east Asians will have their ligaments attach through their ankles making it look like they have thicker ankles (although not all do and Mulan has tiny ankles).  So I don't think they are trying to draw her thicker (she doesn't look big boned or chubby to my eye, she looks like she's toned).

2. Her nose is broad.  Maybe this has something to do with race, or maybe they just realised how creepy the princesses were starting to look with such small noses?

Looking through time as well there are some variations.  Snow White is a little ""thicker"".  So I would propose that we can expect further flip flopping.

daquuiy,I thought that was weird too. I thought (and I've seen this mentioned many times on this sub) that this was a very 'old school' Disney villian. He's an obstacle the characters need to pass but Tamatoa doesn't really have any personal stake in the story or the mission. All he knows is they want 'his' hook. His song was silly because he was obviously just toying with them after he realizes Maui can't use his hook. It also felt like he was channeling Flight of the Concords that whole song.,5ef0j8
damfnm3,I think it's because the song itself stylistically was just so different from the other songs in the soundtrack. The music is very Polynesian inspired whiny Shiny is very rememiscent of something like an 80s ish soft rock song. The dissonance between the Polynesian music and Sjiny can be off outing to some people ,5ef0j8

The chicken was stupid purely because it was funny.  Originally he was literally chicken Mushu, sent by her father to watch over her.  John Lasseter decided that was lame and was going to cut him, and then gave the team 48 hours to rewrite him and see if he stayed.  They took chicken Mushu and then just...made him a normal chicken.  Chickens, being generally too stupid to live, proved to be ridiculously funny.  So, he stayed.  That's it.  That's the reason.  There's not deeper symbolism on the part of the creators.

It's certainly not the best Pixar movie ever, but I think it easily pushes its way into the top ten Pixar films.

However, Kubo still holds the throne for best animated movie of the year, in my opinion.

I don't know if this is *definitively* the best year for animation. It's definitely a contender, but so is 2009, with Fantastic Mr. Fox, Up, Coraline, Cloudy w/, The Secret of Kells, and a few others. A few other years like 2001 and 1999 also come to mind. I do agree, however, that we've reached the best environment for cultivating good animated films in 2016, however. After decades of Disney (and Studio Ghibli in Japan) being the only reliably good animation houses, the 21st century has seen the rise of Dreamworks, Illumination, Laika, Pixar (as an independent entity), and the more widespread success of Japanese studios like Ghibli and Madhouse.

dbus6le,"I'm happy to take a punt at this as well, though /u/morning-ti has done a good job. There were a couple of features in the film that stood out to me. I only watched the film the other day as it came out quite late in New Zealand.


First, the film did a great job of portraying the [Polynesian people as being explorers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo_qZLB4MuI). This might seem pretty obvious now but for a long time it was thought that the Pacific was populated by people who were haphazardly lost at sea and carried by the currents to various islands. That may be how some people did end up in the Pacific but we know today that the Polynesian Navigators are amongst Mankind's best ocean-navigators. These navigators had honed their skills in dead-reckoning and being able to use the wind the waves and the stars to navigate. There are even some stories of these navigators being able to sense large islands well beyond the horizon by that landmass influenced the waves deep out at sea [waves approaching the island would be reflected back out to sea and interfere with the deep sea wave patterns - according to these accounts].

In another story that I heard, when Captain James Cook was first travelling through the Pacific, he met Polynesian navigators that were able to identify all the islands across a reasonable expanse of sea (I was told the size of North America) and aid Captain Cook in his journey. The knowledge that they were able to give to Captain Cook purely from their memory was astounding and goes to show beyond any doubt that these people could navigate the ocean like we might navigate an interstate highway.

I think the way this theme was carried with story telling and cinematography was pretty well-done.

Second, and as has been pointed out, the place of an individual in the context of their family and their ancestors was a really well done theme. So much of Polynesian culture reflects the important place that is held by a person's elders and their ancestors. The film nailed various aspects of this with Moana's relationship with her Grandmother but the scene that really did it for me was when Maui had flown off with his damaged hook and left Moana, alone on her waka and on the brink of giving up her journey. The scene which followed with Moana's ancestors sailing forward and Moana's subsequent reinvigoration beautifully captured Moana drawing strength from her ancestors and being proud/confident in who she was.

**Being confident and proud in who you are, drawing strength from where you are from** pretty much sums up for me what was important in the film. Its a message for anyone, but resonates particularly with those from the Pacific, I think. The film's ability to portray Polynesian history accurately and as something to be proud of was its biggest strength.


p.s. For me there was a constant sense that while the themes were present, there was no spoon-feeding of the ideas. I got the sense that the film was incredibly well researched and planned because at times they used more subtle pieces of dialogue or imagery to support their themes. A lot of the ""nods"" to these themes weren't overtly explained. I though this was really cool and is partly why I think the story particularly resonates with people from the Pacific, but I can see the value in having a discussion somewhere which can elaborate and these for everyone as its these are fascinating cultures and a fascinating history. I'm sure I could benefit from some elaboration too as I have no doubt there were things others picked up that I wouldn't have.

",5ef0j8
dbub6wh,"Hi, your response was interesting for me to read! I am Polynesian (Maori and Samoan) and wondered what Moana was like for other people who aren't Polynesian. There are some very culturally significant themes and symbols that would be very obvious to anyone from the Pacific. The themes that stood out to me were cultural identity and going against the status quo. The song ""Where You Are"" brings attention to the Pacific mindset of working toward collective success. 

>Moana, it's time you knew

>The village of Motunui is all you need

This is her Father encouraging her to stay on the island and to stick the way things have always been done. Collective success is a very big part of Pacific culture.

Later on in the film, Moana's grandmother poses the question ""Do you know who you are?"" After practically being told what to think and do all her life, Moana is sure of who she is and what she wants for herself:

>Who am I?

>I am a girl who loves my island

>I'm the girl who loves the sea

>It calls me

>I am the daughter of the village chief

>We are descended from voyagers

>Who found their way across the world

>They call me

>I've delivered us to where we are

>I have journeyed farther

>I am everything I've learned and more

>Still it calls me

>And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me

>It's like the tide; always falling and rising

>I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me

>That come what may

>I know the way

>I am Moana!﻿

Here she acknowledges her island and the people she descends from. Ancestry is very important in Pacific culture. The symbol of Gramma Tala guiding Moana from the afterlife is something that resonated with me deeply as that is what we believe in our culture. We visualise our ancestors with us in all that we do, and by the end of the film, Moana knows that she can venture out and pursue her calling with her family (alive and dead) supporting her.

I could go on (Maui deserves another few paragraphs alone because of his prominence throughout the Pacific Islands). If you have any questions about any part of the film I can offer a perspective on it.",5ef0j8
dc429cy,"I really saw the whole thing as an allegory for isolationism and breaking from complacency in that kind of society. The film had a lot of spiritual themes that related to respecting and loving the natural elements of the Earth, much of which I assume comes from Polynesian culture.

daddlwa,"Animation in general was pretty solid all around this year.

I can't believe that Secret Life of Pets and Trolls worked as well as they did to the point where I would recommend those films to others.

dakcgoy,"Definitely felt the same. After a few completely unconnected adventures, which felt like episodes of a mini-series stuck together, I felt like we'd been on the water with too few characters for far too long. Maui is too two-dimensional through far too much of the film, making all the focus on Moana, which was just too much for one character's shoulders to take. 

By the time Moana is saving the day by returning the stone, it had been (over?) an hour since we'd been on the island she'd left to save, and I felt very disconnected from it all. I think the scene also lacked some punch because of a lack of a band of brothers to save the day with her - just Maui and the virtual non-character of HeiHei. Compared to previous films where the whole cast lends a helping hand at crucial moments, it felt a little empty.  The lack of band of brothers is also felt in the general feel of the ending - usually Disney films show the main cast living great lives and reaping the rewards of their heroism, but for Moana, she was happy, HeiHei is a non-factor and Maui is just out and about as usual. Obviously her islanders are happy, but they're far from main characters having been absent for so long.

I'll take it from the top. Tamatoa was a sudden plot turn. I agree that it seems like that one was for a more Maui centric plot. There's backstory between those two, with Maui destroying one of his legs and stuff...

But, I disagree with you waving away the importance of wanting to feel needed and loved. It's definitely a strong enough drive. As for that he still doesn't get worshipped, I disagree. In his introduction song and in several instances in the movie he humblebrags about giving the people coconuts and making the islands. The people not only use the coconuts for pretty much everything: eating, drinking, making fires from the leaves, weaving baskets from the leaves... They were also wayfinders. And Maui probably taught them how, hence him being called the god of the sea and wind. He is in their daily lives. How much more important can you get?

The she sucks at sailing: Her father kept her away from boats, she had never sailed before. The ocean carried her in the beginning. Which makes sense, because the father was probably pretty paranoid of losing his daughter. You can't expect people to know what they're never taught.

Video game checkpoint: If Maui had never lost his hook, he would've delivered the stone to the people and we would have a completely different movie. To fight against Te Ka, he needed his powers. While I agree it's very much checkpointy, it's a system that's in every story. The motive-driven and conflict element is a basic thing.

Personally, I didn't mind the pace at all. I liked that it wasn't too on the nose, and yet I still felt like the sea was extremely important to Moana. ",5ef0j8

One seemingly insignificant girl wouldn't be able to provide him with that, especially after a millennium deprived of that adoration. And we find out later in the movie that his motivations were actually to gain the respect and love of those whom he felt abandoned him. At first, Moana did not seem like the person who could have given that to him. He was driven by his obsession, to the point that he would have killed a young girl to obtain it. The heart and drive and sincerity of Moana slowly melt that obsession away but at first, yeah, he is selfish. And that's the point.",5ef0j8

db2yb4g,"You're allowed to have your own subjective opinion, but after reading most of the top critics' reviews,  I'm inclined to agree with them: although the story is familiar, the movie's execution is perfect.   Possibly the most important feature any movie can offer to the audience (more important than the story,  characters,  effects, etc) is the emotional impact. Moana was able to achieve this.   Of course you may disagree and the is still fresh so it's hard to compare critically against the modern Disney canon, but only time will tell.

All the faults you bring up relate to your own subjective experiences with the pacing, music, and exposition.   You are clearly in the minority,  but you have every right to your opinion. ",5ef0j8
db7fn9p,"I pretty much agree with you on all points, though I'd add a few of my own.

While it was visually stunning, it was rather hollow as a movie. Barely any set-up/payoff. I mean we are introduced to Maui as a trickster Demigod first and foremost. Which we see in his introduction to Moana. [Interesting enough as he can mislead her with song and dance. He then changes into a brute for pretty much the rest of the movie. Throwing Moana overboard, punching the coconuts, and basically just bashing Te Ka, instead of being a trickster, or misleading her. The big stretch for him being a trickster in the end sequence is only being able to distract her, for all of 3 minutes and then sacrificing the magic hook.](#spoiler)

Furthermore Moana's ""achievement"" isn't really all that impressive, [all she does to ""find Maui"", is steal a boat, and then get shipwrecked, thanks to omnipotent ocean. If the Ocean can just decide to deliver her anywhere why even bother having her learn wayfinding (which it seems she did barely overnight, in clear weather, hardly impressive if it comes that easy, and only through blackmail)?](#spoiler)

I thought the whole theme of ""becoming your own person and finding your own way"" kind of fell flat, when any time something adverse happens to the lead, she has a safety net [(barring her badassery on the coconut ship). Grandma provides distraction, Ocean makes sure she cannot be removed from her quest, Maui saves her when needed, even at her lowest point, when she gives up, Grandma is immediately on the scene to remove her worries.](#spoiler) 

It's a mixed message of ""you can be/do whatever you want!"" (provided you have ample safety net for any and all eventualities that may befall you). [I mean honestly, what is going to happen to you, on your quest, given by the Ocean, when you are sailing across said sentient Ocean?](#spoiler)",5ef0j8
das7xm0,"I kind of have to agree with you. Lin is great, but his singing and the music overall was bad and forgettable.",5ef0j8
dd6fiwe,"I know this is a late reply... But it definitely felt a like a more Odyssey-esque story than a typical ""here is the evil villain that tries to stop Moana at every turn"" type of story. I did find it boring at times, but I also really liked this new approach. I just think they could have done it a bit better. I actually felt like there wasn't *enough* of that angle. There needed to be more villains! Polynesian culture has lots of cool creatures and myths that could have made the story even more crazy and fantastical.

On a side note, Pocahontas is one of my favourite Disney movies, so I tend to like the slightly different ones. ",5ef0j8
dasx9rn,It's a Disney movie.,5ef0j8
dabzksi,"I completely disagree. At the beginning of her journey, Moana is willing to take on the challenge because she's forced to in order to save her family, but she's definitely still unsure of why the sea picked her or if she's even capable of it alone. Heck, she's so unsure that she completely gives up when Maui appears to give up on her.

But the point is that she doesn't give up. She realizes that she does have what it takes and can do it alone. Maui shows up and helps her (a la Han Solo), but Moana has already decided at that point that she's going to figure out a way to complete the challenge one way or another.",5ef0j8
dac2ji6,"I think for this movie you have to let go of the fact that the role of the main character to grow in ways we are very used to in movies is only assigned to the main character. 

Take everything you said and apply it to Maui and I feel it fits quite nicely. I think it's a more than acceptable exchange of roles between main and supporting characters, as well as a little refreshing. 

Everything you said I feel is present, but you might want to not exclusively look to the lead role for those qualities (specifically in this movie.) It works quite well in my opinion. 

Also, personally, I'm not looking for the cookie cutter lead character in every movie. I'm quite ok with a character that doesn't display growth in ways I'm used to seeing in movies if its replaced with another enjoyable and encompassing trait. Moana was a bad ass from start to finish, and that's ok.",5ef0j8
dac80rs,"I personally feel that Moana does grow as a character.....

The theme of the film is ""know thyself"".  Almost all the characters save for gramma are lost and ignorant of who they are and what they are capable of.  The islanders have forgotten they were explorers, and after losing her heart, Tefiti became enraged and forgot herself as well.  Maui mistakenly believes his only value is his magical hook.

Moana is trying to be everything everyone else thinks she should be.  Her heart/instincts are telling her one thing and her brain/reason is telling her another.  She tries to be what her father wants her to be.  She tries to ignore the ocean and lead the village the way he does.  But she's ends up leading the way Moana would, which at the time seems wrong(even though in hindsight she is doing the exact right thing for her people!), and she feels lost and confused.  Then she sets out on the hero's journey because gramma tells her she is the chosen one.  She's just a scared kid full of doubt trying to be brave.   She tries to convince herself the ocean chose her for a reason, but it doesn't make any sense.  Why would the ocean choose her?  She doesn't have faith in herself.  She thinks her part in this is to find Maui and he will restore the heart.  He is the hero.  Not her.  When Maui leaves she completely gives up.  

But after talking/singing with Gramma's spirit she comes to realize she is the hero.  She has done amazing things on this journey.  She is descended from people that did incredible things.  She feels empowered.  She finds faith in herself.  She ""knows"" herself.  

Moana was the exact right person to calm Tefiti's rage and restore the heart.  When she helped the tiny turtle at the beginning the ocean knew.  She didn't need to be a Demi-God with awesome powers.  She just needed to be herself.  That was all the ocean required of her.   
 
Anyways hopefully that makes sense.  This theme really resonated with me personally, but movies mean different things to different people.  This is just what I got out of it.  :)

The song was not only fun, it was a vital foreshadowing of the central theme of the movie, the certainty of identity in the face of tragedy and self-doubt. It was the classic scene where the villain shows how their philosophy is great, how it'd be so easy and fun to give up and live life their way (he literally doesn't have to work to eat), and how the heroes have got it all wrong.

danx9xm,"hey thanks for the nice note.  I do recommend you see it no matter what, especially if you have young children.  When I see a kids movie I really check for the messages and the lessons they're teaching kids, especially young girls.  Up until recently I only find most of Miyazaki films to be exceptional for young girls.  Starting from Frozen (to a lessor extent) Disney movies has been gotten better in this respect though.

As for your question - I think Moana is far superior to both Finding Dory and Zootopia.  Both are good animated movies, but Moana is head and shoulder above them.  Dory is also a Pixar film so I actually have different standard for it. 

* Plot: Zootopia has a good storyline and a decent message, but Moana is much more positive and empowering.  Finding Dory feels more like another sequel trying to squeeze money out of the love for the previous movie.  Entertaining but with a ridiculous story.  

* Animation:  Moana's just a beautiful movie in almost every frame. Zootopia is also right up there in term of technique, but the ambience is different.  FD is typical Pixar animation magic.

* Music: Moana wins hands down, being a musical with songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame.  Almost every song is special and memorable. Shiny is one of the greatest villain song ever.  The other two are not musicals so it's not comparable... Zootopia has a catchy theme song from Shakira, and I can't remember a single score or song from Finding Dory. 

So regardless of what I think please go see it for yourself.  If you like animation I'm going to bet you'll love Moana. ",5ef0j8

It's like people were freaking out about the snow on Mauna Loa, despite the fact that the highest mountains on the Big Island routinely get snow. It's no big deal.

And yes, there is a rather strong Hawaiian sovereignty movement. Their perspective is that the overthrow and annexation were illegal, and so Hawai'i should be an independent nation again. There are also other things about modern day issues and development (the Mauna Kea telescope being a recent example). The issues are all really complex due to the current situation.

As for the journeying through the Pacific, it's really amazing how they used celestial navigation and other observation skills in order to sail.

db0hmw5,"I think more he means that in a lot of films that try and have a strong female lead they focus too much on the fact that lead is a woman and that every struggle the lead faces is because of that.  In regards to a movie about the struggles a woman faces because of her gender, it make sense, but it tends to be the main point of conflict in films that aren't necessarily about gender.  Actually, a good example is a film I saw a trailer for before the film, Hidden Figures.   The film is definitely about the struggles of the three female protagonists and I honestly would love to see the film.  For Moana though, I really appreciate that they didn't make her gender her character.  They gave us a character with strengths and flaws.   They gave us a strong female lead without having to spell it out for us.",5ef0j8

On the other hand I'm kind of an interesting case study, because despite growing up at the right time, I had only seen a few Disney movies before late high school/college. So I saw things like Lion King, Aladdin, Princess and the Frog, Hunchback, Tangled, Tarzan, all 3 Toy Stories, and Wreck it Ralph for the first time within a few months of each other. For me, Aladdin in particular is just an average Disney movie. Not bad, but nothing special. I'd rank tangled and tarzan down there too.

Heck, even Mother Gothel was pretty good. 

We've been lacking only very recently. And, in most cases, it was because the villain wasn't really the focus or important part of the story. They were there for a little added drama. Wreck It Ralph's villain was good, but it was a different type of story where it was more of a journey of personal discovery. Big Hero 6 did have quite a disappointing villain. A few tweaks could have made him a lot better. Frozen's villain was tacked on, as, again, it was more of a story of coming to terms with yourself and familial relationships. The villain exists so they could have a large ending showpiece, but it wasn't really necessary to the main plot.  Zootopia was fairly typical, but I was fine with the villain. And, in Moana, again, the villain was a bit of a misdirect. I do wish we had gotten a little more with the main, but I was satisfied.

daz8l9s,"Instead of downvoting I'll try to be informative... Like a lot of things, real Feminism is a totally reasonable and generally great movement. 

The problem is that the only 'feminism' people get to hear about now are people acting batshit crazy and calling themselves feminists. Sound familiar? It should. 

From Wikipedia:

> Feminism is a range of political movements, ideologies, and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social rights for women.

Just having that discussion as a society was incredibly important. It's gone on to lay the groundwork for many other discussions about equality. 

You don't have to shit on men to be feminist. In fact, if you think men are inferior or try to push an agenda that women should have MORE than men (or blacks more than whites, or that the rich should all die in a fire... you can see where i'm going with this) you're completely MISSING THE POINT. Which is why we call them feminazis... that's not a discussion of equality anymore. 

On the topic of this movie. Plenty of movies have 'strong female leads', but that's not really the point. Everyone is calling it a wonderful feminist message because the main character is female... and it doesn't matter! No one treats her any different. Her body isn't part of the plot. Her love life isn't part of the story. If you make a female character that could have been 100% replaced with a male character without any aspect of the film being affected, then you've actually managed a **truly** equal representation.",5ef0j8

Maui really wants to just get his fishhook back, and the problem is if that's his goal and Moana's goal is ""get him to end boss island"" there is no reason for him to help her, aside from goodness of his Disney heart and insistence from a convenient almighty wave God.

I guess I should clarify - it's not that I'm discounting his need to feel needed. I think that's a great and interesting take on a demi God's desires and his backstory does bear that out.

My point is more that his desire to be needed just doesn't feel like a strong enough reason for him to help Moana.

My point about sailing (and it's a minor one) is that someone who has snuck away at night to teach herself how to sail is a way more interesting character for me BUT obviously there are other story concerns. I'm speaking about a theoretical movie where I'm more speculating how that could have helped make her a character that Maui might actually help because she has something to offer. In this movie, what does she have to offer Maui (other than a promise of people will worship you again)? I'm not saying it's not realistic - people do things because they want to be famous. But in a fictional story, I've found you have a much more interesting movie if your characters do things for reasons that are intimately tied to the conflicts of the movie itself, and the characters within that movie. His need to feel needed, for example, has nothing to do with returning the heart, nor is it something that Moana has that she can give him.

The video game checkpoint thing I hate because it's not about motive-drivenness - it's about not having your stories be told with ""but"" and ""therefore"" (the South Park guys talk about this here: http://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2014/03/06/writing-advice-from-south-parks-trey-parker-and-matt-stone/)

Maui and Moana need the fish hook. They go to Te Ka. They fight him. And then they get the fish hook. And then they go to the island.

That's boring. Finding Dory, for example, did this sort of thing much much better in my opinion. Dory needs to get to the exhibit. She makes it BUT her goal is revealed to be elsewhere, and her ally left her.

Point being - achieve goals. Goals should have consequences to make a story interesting.",5ef0j8
dav50s9,"> There was no real reason for Maui and Moana to come together. Either could've completed the story on their own.

I disagree. Maui could have, but didn't want to. (And even that's doubtful--she helps him out of jams just as much as the other way around.) Moana wanted to, but would not have been able to. She needed to convince him, and he needed to be convinced.",5ef0j8
dav1yu4,"Like to go further - wouldn't it have been more in keeping of the underlying theme of the movie if it turns out (as trite as this might be) that he doesn't need the hook, I.e. he is who he really is?

Really, he's a Kupua, which is a hard idea to translate.

You didn't actually meet a single Polynesian god or goddess in the movie.  Lono the god of the heavens, Papa, mother earth, Rongo, god of crops, Tangaloa, god of the seas, Tu, god of war, Tawhiri, the true god of wind and storms (Maui is just a kupua of wind and sea), pele the fire goddess, Kanaloa, the god of the underworld...

dc0z4eh,"Yes, I love *I Am Moana*! I am happy to offer a Maori perspective of Maui and the stories I grew up with.

Maui was a real person (I am a direct descendant of him) and he is a very prominent character throughout the Pacific. The stories that surround him are often embellished in order for our people to learn important lessons. We often glorify him as we recognise the impact that he had across the Pacific.

A few of the stories mentioned in *Moana* involve Maui fishing up islands, catching the sun, and stealing fire.

In Maori culture, we have a story about Maui fishing up the North Island of New Zealand. In Maori the North Island is called *Te Ika-a-Maui* or literally *The Fish of Maui*. Interestingly, the North Island does [resemble a stingray](http://nemp.otago.ac.nz/social_studies/2001/media/shape.jpg) (an important symbol in *Moana*). Maui also used a hook (made from the jawbone of his grandmother) to fish up the island.

The story about catching the Sun starts with Maui being dissatisfied with the amount of sunlight hours in a day. He forms a plan to slow the Sun down with ropes (he sings about how he ""Lassoed the Sun"" in *You're Welcome*) and the magic jawbone hook. The lesson in this story is to make the most of the time we have in the day and not to let it go past quickly!

The story of Maui stealing the secret of fire also involves the shape-shifting abilities that we see in the film. He finds the Goddess of Fire and learns that she produces fire from her fingernails. She gives Maui one of her nails for him to create fire, and being the trickster that he is, Maui pretends to lose it and asks for another. He continues this trend until all of the Goddess' fingernails are gone and she becomes enraged at his trickery. The Goddess of Fire set the land and see alight to try and kill Maui but he shape shifts into a hawk and flies to safety.

There is a [Wiki about Maui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ui_(M%C4%81ori_mythology) from a Maori cultural perspective, I hope this gives you an idea of why Maui is so prominent in the Pacific!",5ef0j8
dhbg2jj,Yes! It's such a beautifully crafted song and the point where Moana realises her purpose. Chills every time!,5ef0j8
dajvlpo,That movie has really bad trailers that feel like they give away the whole story.  Hopefully they expand what was shown since it just seems like a standard music contest story but with animals. ,5ef0j8
davjt0i,"It does track through the movie. It's the core of his character and explains his motivations at pretty much every point. He ties his identity to being a demi-god, because when he was a demi-god was the only time people liked him (his time as a human having been when he was abandoned by his parents).

He's so intent on finding his hook, because he ties his self worth to his hook (the hook representing being a demi-god). He's so reluctant to fight the fire demon again, because last time he lost his hook. He gets mad at Moana because she's the reason he fought the fire demon again and his hook cracked. 

His character development comes when he realizes that he's more than his hook and knowingly sacrifices it to help Moana. That's the payoff.

We actually do get a brief shot of Maui flying over the fleet at the end. I think it would kind of undermine his character development if he had gone back with Moana and been like ""Yo, island people, worship me I'm an awesome god hero""",5ef0j8
db2glqe,"I mean, even discarding any personal bond with Moana and disregarding his character development, it was never *just* about wanting the people to love him—it's phrased that way in the beginning when Moana is trying to appeal to his ego, but it's more than that. The islanders (and probably not just Moana's island) are actually at risk of dying out due to the spreading blight; without them, not only will he not be remembered, but all his past heroic exploits and previous efforts to help humanity will have been for nothing. So when we see him happily soaring alongside a thriving, voyaging people at the end, that in itself is a payoff for him—his people have survived to make use of his gifts.",5ef0j8
dav26x8,"I heard it was originally about Maui and changed during production, although I admit it is just hearsay. You can definitely see it throughout the film though.

db2ga3d,"Well, and also the people were actually dying out because the blight was spreading from island to island. They may not have stopped believing in him entirely (although he's clearly become less a hero and more a villain/trickster in their minds), but I think the reason for the quest is more ""because there will be no humans left in Polynesia at all if I/we don't fix my mistake"" than just ""so the humans will love me again."" Moana phrases it the latter way to him initially because she's trying to appeal to his massive ego, but I don't get the impression that's what he was primarily looking for by the end.",5ef0j8
db4x558,"You got me thinking but I still disagree that there's completely no reason for him to help her and that she's useless. Like /u/animebop said, he's very weak emotionally. We learn later that he's got issues with self esteem which he deals with by 'buying' people's affection. Moana does a great job of helping him deal with those and persuaiding him to do the right thing. 

Besides, he loves audience.

Also, ocean doesn't let him get rid of her until he values her enough to willingly help her.

Other than that, he really isn't that selfish as he makes himself to be. His tattoo is a representation of his true self that he hides behind his impudent and boastful persona and tries to shut off not be be taken as anything other than awesome. He thinks he has to be this person in order to gain affection from others. Moana doesn't buy into that and values his true 'weak' self which gives him real strenght and confidence. It takes time until he realizes that but it's there.

Also, he's shown flying along with the boats which is a clear sign that humans welcome and respect him. 

What you can argue though is that they didn't bother to give much explanation about why he suddenly comes back to save her after he flew away. ",5ef0j8
db1fvpy,"Sorry, this is late, but I wanted to add something to the ""why doesn't she know how to sail"" question. It's fairly clear that deep-water ocean sailing (along with wayfinding) is a whole new skillset compared with the shallow-water fishing-boat sailing her people do within the reef, and it's been long enough that the village has lost that knowledge and there'd be no one to teach her even if her father allowed her on the water. The type of boats the village builds now aren't adequate to the task (as we see from her and her father's unsuccessful forays), so she couldn't have snuck out successfully past the reef without finding her ancestors' boats. Moana magically being able to sail the seas like a master by herself without some kind of tutelage would be incredibly unrealistic. (Look at how much people are complaining about Rey's flight skills in TFA, for goodness' sake—and Moana doesn't have the Force to guide her instincts.) Without the ocean helping her out a bit in the initial stages, she'd never have survived to find her way to Maui in the first place.",5ef0j8
db1hfh8,"I'm not sure the Maui we meet could have completed the story, to be honest. Putting the heart back wasn't just a brute-force task—for starters, there's no indication that he even realizes Te Ka is Te Fiti, and Te Ka also had to consent in order for her heart to be put back. I don't think she would have trusted Maui himself on his own to do that, and I don't think he would be capable of overpowering her, hook or no hook.",5ef0j8

The point isn't that she can't do it. It's that she doesn't *believe* she can. She's forced into it and steps up because she's the hero, but she can't really complete the challenge until she truly believes she can.

In the film, their were two diety characters, Te Fiti and Te Ka. Te Ka was the fiery, smoky incarnation of Te Fiti, who she turned into after her heart was stolen by Maui.

The two main characters have all this bizarre, easily averted subtext related to their sexes and races. Poe and Admiral Statura were both real dudes with no subtext just being humans in a society with virtually no concepts of racism or even human sub-races in its canon. But Finn was basically Kevin Hart and Rey was a little less Ripley and a little more Ghostbusters 2016 than was probably reasonable. That whole ""let go of my hand"" deal and the weird victimization by her cousin was sketchy.

Although on the flip side of that, having actual dark possibly sexual definitely violent urges be part of a morally conflicted empowered white male character? Kylo Ren trying to mindrape Rey was some heavy shit, and it worked just as well if not better with Poe who couldn't even resist it, male though he is.

Since Moana just hit home video, I watched it for the first time last night and again today.  I have a question for you:  Do you think that the depiction of Maui's arrogance is accurate to the stories you grew up with?  I've read some of the Hawaiian Maui stories, but they tend to stick strictly to events, and they don't give an indication of how Maui is regarded.  Given all the mischief he gets up to, the egocentric depiction fits for me.  How did you feel about it?  Is he sort of the ultimate jock?  

Beyond that, watching the documentaries that came with the movie, it gave me a really warm feeling to see the participation of the Pacific islanders in this film, even down to the hair of one particular woman being the model for both Maui's and Moana's hair.

So the problem for me is: What reason does he have to help Moana?Disney answers this well most of the time - Aladdin can grant the Genie his freedom, for example.

After all, she doesn't know where the fishhook is (hey there's a thought), she sucks at sailing, etc. etc. There is no reason for him to help her.

The reason why he does is because an omnipotent body of water forces him to and his conscience represented by a well-animated tattoo forces him to. It's just not that interesting a character motivation for me and something I wish had a little more weight.",5ef0j8

In Zootopia, the villain is a racist sheep, and Judy suffers from the same racist undertones too.

This is why it initially takes an outside force for him to help her, just like it took the intervention of the ocean for her to be able to get to him in the first place, but I got the sense that by the end he wasn't being forced to help her at all. The Maui who brought humanity so many benefits, despite having been rejected by humanity at birth, was a hero not just because of his awesome exploits but because of his generosity, and that is what he finally reclaims—we don't need to see him receiving adulation from the humans at the end because he's gotten past just doing things for the sake of his ego. Moana leads the way to his realizing this: she helps him get the fishhook even though she has no guarantee that he'll stick around once he regains his powers (he could just fly away!), which impresses him and opens his heart to her; by compelling him to mentor her, she helps him to remember the joy of educating and helping humanity; and then she helps him recognize and deal with the pain of his rejection by his parents.

As for him giving the hook up just to get it back again, he *didn't know* he would ever get it back—that's the whole point. He had it broken, then faced down the lava demon without his powers to try to save Moana (that's the point when he does the haka).

dackq9z,"Here's another perspective to chew on: Rey's flat, unblemished character is going to date TFA, and it won't even take very long. In a few more years, it's going to be considered sexist to present a woman on screen with such idyllic traits, and it will bore audiences just as we became bored with perfect male leads.

TFA will be nigh-unwatchable. The original trilogy never made Leia out to be perfect, which is why her character stands to this day. Padme straddled the line, but Rey is so far into safe-and-perfect-land that I wonder where they can actually take her in the sequels.

Except the answer is obvious, since this is Disney: all lead characters will have an arc reset each film. In episode VIII, Rey will start her training with no apparent affinity in the Force. Finn will be a cowardous turncoat who has to learn about fighting for a righteous cause. Poe will be written out of the screenplay for 2/3 of the movie because they don't know how to use him effectively. ",5ef0j8

The plot makes sense in a ""this happens, and then this happens"" sort of way, but felt Maui's motivations felt half baked, which necessitated some omnipotent characters to basically force him to go along. I think it would have been a more interesting movie if they concocted a reason for him to help that put him at odds with our main character without having the god of the ocean giving him no choice in the matter. I think in general movies that show characters making choices of their own free will are more interesting than movies where they don't.

I am also saying that it is apparent that this movie was about Maui in the first place precisely because he seems to have an interesting character arc that is not really served by this story and doesn't really intersect with Moana's.

Just as a point of advice - chucking around glib last words might make you feel like an Internet argument superstar, but it certainly doesn't encourage any sort of actual discussion (nor does it make it seem like you care to do so).

Her interactions with Han Solo, especially when he gives her a blaster and a job, show her to be inexperienced and new to the galaxy. Her character struggle comes not from learning new skills, but from how to apply those skills. Will she be able to turn away from her desire to wait on Jakku? Will she be able to accept the mantle of Jedi forced on her, or face the villains that title requires her to, especially Ren who haunts her and attempts to control her mind? Her journey toward finding her place in the galaxy is totally compelling to me, and I wasn't distracted at all by her not going through learning scenes.

I didn't have a problem as I was watching the movie, story-wise, with him being out for himself initially; he clearly has a motivation to start with (to get off his island using Moana's boat, and to get his powers back by retrieving the hook), and she is basically just an annoying tag-along to him at the start, but he comes to care about her and remember his previous affection for her people over the course of the movie.

That said, after reading what you wrote now I understand what you're saying and I partialy agree with it. I personally wish there was more to her that an this urge to travel she was feeling. It was established and developed properly but something was missing. I can't quite name it. Maybe the fact that she was chief's daughter was a little bit too much for me. It would have been great if she was a nobody by heritage. But I understand why they went this way. It's just my personal preference probably.

Hmm, the other point you're making got me to think. Is it bad though? That he's developed so well? It's been established in the trailers and throughout the movie that he's almost like the second main character. I don't think everything needs to be about the main girl is what I'm saying. It's perfectly ok, more than okay to develop the side characters as well. Miyazaki does that too and I always thought that it makes the movie feel deep and worth exploring.

Initially he needs her boat because he's marooned on that island without powers, and the ocean ensures that she basically comes with the boat. He's not going to ditch his only means of ocean travel, which providentially arrived after centuries of waiting, just because of her. And he has ample purely selfish motivation to go to get his hook and powers back. Even after that, his powers are only working erratically so he can't rely on them to travel on his own. It's only after sorting *that* out that he has less reason to keep going the same way she's going, and by then they've already started to bond. So Moana convinces him to at least try to face Te Ka again, and he figures he might as well try. Even this is still a self-interested choice for him: he adds another notch to his belt and proves he can defeat the lava demon after all, that earlier loss was a fluke, and hey, maybe he'll get respect from the humans again if he does this. Then after his hook is damaged and it becomes clear that he's at a very real risk of losing everything he's regained, he more or less pulls a Han at Yavin 4 and heads out of there before his conscience and the development he's gone through finally result in his choice to return at the critical moment.",5ef0j8

Han & Leia's son, Luke's nephew, Vader's grandson.

dbl15y9,"Would it be less objectionable to you if the power in question were anthropomorphic? Plenty of people in movies and books do things because they're forced to do them by someone with more power than they have, and plenty of those are initially reluctant and then come around. I don't know—it just doesn't seem particularly bad to me, especially since her initial foiling of his plan to leave her behind is *not* supernaturally aided: he shuts her in the cave, and she finds her own way out on her own initiative and swims after him.

I was bothered by the circumstances of that scene too, but not for the same reasons as you. The interference of the ocean and resulting slapstick masks the fact that what Maui is doing to Moana is incredibly cruel. First he not only maroons her on the same island he's been trapped on, but shuts her in a barren cave with no food or water except a few pieces of fruit. Then he tosses her into the ocean, which is certain death by drowning without the ocean's help—and if I'm remembering right, the first time he throws her overboard he doesn't know the ocean will do this for her. I think it says a lot about the emotional toll of his stint on the island, and how much he's not thinking straight, that he's gone from generous demigod to someone who'll straight-up *murder his rescuer*. This is part of the reason I was OK with the ocean interfering: the ocean isn't just doing this to help Moana, it's doing it to help Maui. Because in his right mind Maui would never do this to an innocent girl whose only crime was helping him escape, offering to help him restore his powers, and expecting him to do something for her in return instead of just fucking off (when, again, he could simply leave her after getting his shapeshifting back). This isn't so much like Han deciding whether or not to take Obi-Wan and Luke off-planet as it is like Han just leaving everybody in the trash compactor.

I was uncomfortable about how it was handled because I don't think the movie really emphasized the potential gravity of what he did. But I'm always bothered by this kind of thing in Disney and Pixar movies, and I think it's just a slapstick convention I'm not used to, and part of the price for keeping it a kids' movie. If anything, having that character development arc for Maui and having him so ready to sacrifice himself at the end meant it was more satisfyingly addressed in *Moana* than in most other Disney-type movies.

Edit: Also, I think it's important to emphasize that this level of interference is only the case at the beginning. If the entire movie were just the ocean whooshing them around like pieces on a chessboard or forcing Maui to help her, I'd agree with you that it wasn't satisfying. But I think it's crucial that Maui starts off reluctant and selfish but in the end is making decisions and sacrifices on his own, in the same way that Moana starts out dependent on supernatural help but in the end learns to sail the seas and figure out problems on her own. It really helped to reinforce the education and coming-of-age themes of this movie, and the way in which supernatural aid guides personal choice and the past guides the present was a large part of the point: they do so as a parent or a teacher does, with the goal of getting the person to act on their own.",5ef0j8
