ei2obe9,"I saw this with a Q&A by the director in New York last week and some behind the scenes fun facts

- They were not originally going to use the 65mm film until someone from the national archives contacted them that they found it. 
- The government shutdowns last year impacted some of the scanning and digitization of the film - as in vehicles stuck between DC and New York. 
- Once they were done scanning they made proper backups of hte scans and moved them out of the city on multiple hard drives
- There exists a 9 day edit of the film where all the raw footage was laid out on a timeline. 
- The film recorded did not have audio synced to it, so someone had to go in and manually lip sync the comms with Mission control to the footage. ",ayhuw3

ei982sb,"I just got out of it and it was spectacular. This film shows how important good editing is. A complete narrative was given without a single piece of narration being heard. This and First Man would make for a great double feature. 

Kinda perplexed by the people in my theater who left after they landed on the moon. The return to Earth was one of the most joyous moments of the film. ",ayhuw3
ei1rao0,"I saw this last week in IMAX, this was great.  I was surprised at the sheer variety of footage and angles and sources they were able to get video from, from (obviously) official NASA footage of significant events, to mundane NASA footage of the launch command at idle, etc., to random people in the crowd miles away waiting to watch the launch.  The film and sound restoration (?) was gorgeous as well.

I was also a little surprised (although it shouldn't be surprising given the time period) at how conspicuously white everyone in the footage was.  There were exactly 3 black men, who were placed prominently in the editing, and a handful of other people of color went by quickly in a few of the crowd shots near the end once the astronauts made it back home.  Just a bit shocking to see, from a modern perspective, like the entire event almost didn't exist outside of white America.",ayhuw3
ei1lv2j,"I saw this film last week in IMAX.

It's beyond stunning what they were able to do with this footage. It's gorgeous. The sound is incredible, you feel and hear every rocket blast. 

In my theater, I had a father sitting next to me with his kid and they were talking throughout the movie. Normally, I'd be annoyed, but I was just so happy for him to share the wonder of space with his son and answer his many questions. If it was amazing to me, a fully grown man, I'm sure it blew his little mind.

It's not really a ""documentary"" in the normal sense, as it sacrifices the normal contextualizing of a documentary to put you 100% in the experience as it is happening. Worth seeing!!!",ayhuw3
ei1mof4,"It's certainly beautiful. Watching it, I genuinely would've thought they shot it on IMAX cameras a week ago, I have no idea how they made it look so good. As a film, I don't know! I enjoyed it, but it's also not the type of documentary you're used to seeing, with interviews and voiceover. I still don't know if that works for or against it, but I'd definitely recommend seeing it if you can, on the biggest screen you can. It's very interesting.",ayhuw3

ei1p6rp,"Finally. I made an unofficial discussion yesterday because there was no sign of an official one. Alright, let’s talk. 

Honest to god this might be one of the best documentaries I’ve ever seen and is EASILY the best film restoration in cinema history. The opening half hour with the lead-up and launch..... jaw dropping, and the best part is that it really doesn’t stop until the end (I mean the shots of the moon from the crafts when they’re approaching...... holy fucking shit). The movie flows so flawlessly well just like the mission itself that it almost mesmerizes you considering how “primitive” technology was compared to now. I really REALLY REALLY hope that this and First Man are re-released this July because I really think there are no two better films than these to help show a microcosm of the MASSIVE scope of sending men to the moon. ",ayhuw3
ei4gtxc,"One thing I have always had problems with is picturing the scale of the Apollo rockets. I mean, I know they were big. I even searched out a building in my city that is the same height to get a perspective. 

Seeing this film on an imax screen really made it feel big to me. And watched the launch actually seemed like I was watching an entire skyscraper lifting off. Things like this are why I still go to theatres. Some things just aren’t the same on a 55” screen at home. ",ayhuw3

ej0i2bu,"Personally loved the choice to not have a traditional narrator, but rather use mission control and television broadcasts to tell the story. The moon scenes were especially tense- the silence in between sentences during the moon broadcast added both suspense and a sense of realism to how people were watching live in 1969. 

&#x200B;

Also thought Nixon's speech to Neil and Buzz on the surface was shockingly beautiful, and had to be one of the higher points in his career that I would have never known about for obvious reasons. Thought this was truly an innovative documentary for me.",ayhuw3
ei1xst7,"gonna steal my other comment from another thread since there wasn't a official discussion at the time

watched it a few days ago. it's a absolute incredible experience and you don't have to know anything about space or the apollo missions to appreciate it. it was like watching interstellar (the music and sound design is amazing), but this happened for real lol.

I almost got teary eyed watching this also, when the movie finished and as we were leaving our seats I noticed an elderly person wiping away his tears. made me wonder if he had anything to do with it or knew someone or something",ayhuw3

ei245uw,"Apollo 11 is simply incredible. 

&#x200B;

Even if you've spent your whole life watching Apollo documentaries this film is a can't miss opportunity I assure you. Much of the pre-launch and launch footage is sourced from 65mm film that has never been presented before and much of it hadn't even been viewed at NASA before they lent it to the filmmakers. It was shot on a type of film developed for the military and produced for a partnership with a studio that fell through. The equipment to play it didn't even exist any more and special scanners had to be employed to play the footage.

The footage from those reels is incredible, nearly grain free as if it were shot yesterday. While we have all seen the same Saturn launch stock footage from decades, this new film gives several new perspectives and in a clarity that I've never seen. The IMAX presentation is gorgeious visually and the sound is bone shaking. Even the footage from inside Mission control or just viewing the crowds is transporting, like time travel. Throughout much of the film, they have taken the time to try to sync up the usual mission control audio chatter with the matching filmclips whereever possible. Even some of the footage from inside the Apollo 11 craft is new I believe, and much I've never seen included in any other docs, probably due to their low framerates.

There have been many, many documentaries about Apollo 11 and the whole Apollo program. We are lucky that the 50th anniversary of the moonlanding is being greeted with one of the absolute best. I definitely recommending finding the time this week to try to catch it before it gets pushed out of theaters.",ayhuw3

eku9md8,"I was fortunate enough to be able to see it in IMAX at the air and space museum today, as they held on to it longer.

I was blown away. There were way too many times during that movie that I had to remind myself it was real footage and not something made via CGI, practical special effects, and so on. Especially with the launch sequence.",ayhuw3
ejopedj,"I enjoyed this. 

Like everyone else has stated, the launch and tension when the jets fire up is intense.  They also use this angle of the rocket climbing into the sky in slow motion, which was simply amazing and you feel like you are really there (which begs the question, why did they keep cutting away to crowd shots instead of just following the progress of the rocket?).

Another scene I enjoyed immensely was probably within the first 15 minutes when you see the faces of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins in such great detail.  Their expressions of confidence mixed with a bit of pensiveness is absolutely compelling.

I do see how one could fall asleep during this movie, as the mission control voices are a bit of an effort to follow, and a little too technical for casual viewers.   

Nonetheless, seeing this mission in such great detail and looking at the sheer amount of technical expertise from NASA to make this happen is just dumbfounding.

ei1p6tk,"What a great time capsule of film, seeing everyone from this era was so cool.",ayhuw3
ei29asv,"I said it in another thread but of the 3 documentaries I've seen this year, this one was the ""Coolest."" 

They Shall Not Grow Old was more technically impressive with the restoration. Free Solo was harrowing and tense like a fictional film would make me feel. 

Apollo 11 was just fucking cool. From the score, to the editing, to the choices to feature only recorded speech instead of interviews or narration. It was like a symphony bringing together so many different efforts and footage into what felt like a dramatization because it was all just so perfect. Speech synced up to the time, synced up to the lip movements of the speakers. Music synced up to the countdowns to make you deeply aware of the ticking clock even while it wasn't on screen. 

I'm glad this will be going to science theaters later on, though I hope they choose effective edits for that. ",ayhuw3

ei2d016,"An absolute masterpiece. Seeing this in IMAX was one of the best theater experiences I’ve had.  That 70mm launch with the seats rumbling was insane.

Definitely tapped into those trippy ‘Baraka’ / ‘koyaanisqatsi’ vibes for me where I just sat there in amazement. ",ayhuw3
ei1pl9g,This movie was incredible. I loved how they just used the radio comms and all the actual footage rather than a traditional doc that would have been intercut with interviews on the topic at hand.

ei6da5s,"Went and saw the movie this afternoon.

LOVED IT. Just a gorgeous movie from start to finish. Can't believe NASA never released any of this footage until now.

My only gripe? I wish I could've seen this in IMAX. But Captain Marvel took over the IMAX screenings here in LA so all I had was standard screens. Still, a pretty great documentary that I wish we could see more of.

Why not do one for Apollo 13? I'm sure there is just as much footage to cover a documentary exactly like this.",ayhuw3
ei8rk8w,"A question occurred to me while watching it, and maybe some NASA nerds in this thread know the answer:

Having gone in with little expectation to be thrilled, this movie absolutely amazed me. It does an excellent job of driving home the scale and significance of the mission. I hadn't seen a film in IMAX in years (since Avatar I think) and the scope and sound of it completely blew me away.

ei2v9hk,"The whole audience applauded once the credits hit. Gonna be interesting to see if this film does well at the box office as it's edited like an art film, not a conventional doc.

I had the same feeling of chills that I had during the ten-ish minute lunar landing scene in First Man, but it was stretched out over all 90 minutes of this documentary. The restored 70mm footage is breathtaking and the narrative is beautifully edited. This is a must watch, especially on the biggest screen with the loudest sound you can find.

Watched this on a massive IMAX screen with a Director Q&A at the end, which I didn't know was part of the screening and was a pleasant surprise. It's not in IMAX screens anymore but still worth the trip to a normal theater IMO.",ayhuw3

ei35vn7,"Saw it in a liemax two days ago. Kinda ruined by people talking (loudly, so as to be heard over the loudness of the film) and an older woman in front of me taking photos of the screen with her iPhone. Probably should have waited for the wide-release in regular theaters (since I drove an hour and half to see it), but I had thought the movie was *only* going to be shown in IMAX for 1 week. Would highly recommend, however. Maybe I'll go see it again, because I sort of want to see it with closed captions.

Also, kind of funny to see all of the G-rated trailers for children's movies despite the audience being (probably) an average age of 55.

Also, p neat that the music was made on instruments/equipment from the era.

Edit: saw it again with closed captions. There's a couple scenes where the audio/music drowns out the comms (intentional or not). And there are still some bits transcribed as *(indistinct)*, though. Also, this is probably a good idea to skim through before seeing if you're not up to snuff with the alphabet soup: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/apollo.glossary.html",ayhuw3

I found there was a ton of footage on the ground, which I like, but I would’ve liked to see more stills and film from the mission. I know they didn’t film a whole lot, but when they put the hasselblads up it was amazing to see them finally on the big screen. I like that the film was just the mission, but I still found myself wanting a little more. Honestly from what everybody has been saying, the absolute way to watch this is in IMAX and it’s a damn shame it was only in imax for a short time. I’d have to put first man above this just a little bit but nonetheless this is the best quality footage we have to date and everybody who worked on the restoration project (including my dude Robert pearlman) should be very very proud.

I made this in another comment, but I feel like this works here too. 

 Apollo 11 falls under the same  form of documentary like other great films such as “Let the Fire Burn”, “June 17th, 1994”, “LA 92”, “102 Minutes that Changed America”, “Woodstock” and others where the sole job of the documentary is to do just that. Document. Show (in a microcosm) what it was like watching these events unfold during that time period. To me, these are the finest documentaries out there because it simplifies the genre down to its basic definition, and this one is no exception in my book. ",ayhuw3

ei8ze8g,"> I have no idea how they made it look so good

Actually this is really interesting! Basically, all this stuff was recorded with film, as you know - but the implication of that means the detail is recorded down in an analog format. As in a physical structure made of reacting molecules, not data. 

On 70mm film, like what a lot of this was, it's the equivalent of 18K video. As in, almost five times higher than 4K.

What creates the disconnect is that before recent times, we didn't have any way to *display* that detail in a way that really used it. High quality film looked low detail on a 70's TV because that was the best resolution we had to display it for the average household. So we have this association that things filmed back then don't look as good.



Obviously, though, the older and worse film you use, the worse it'll look. There was definitely film back then that was just plain low quality, and really old stuff degrades and gets dirty. But for big events like this, they were using the good stuff.

There's a lot of cool examples of people going back to old film and getting the full quality out of it. That's how they do a lot of remasters. [Check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKFZ8qxmjF4) for example.

By that time, the crew of 11 had already been training for some time, and to swap them out with the 10 crew would've been unlikely due to not just the lack of confidence it would display in Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins, but the potential risks of what would've been an insanely short and exhausting turnaround for the 10 crew.


NASA did briefly consider using the crew of Apollo 8, which had basically done everything 11 would've had to do other than bring along the LEM and take it down to the surface, for much the same reasons you suggested using the crew of 10. Though the turnaround time of 7 months would still be rushed, it was a little more reasonable than the 7 weeks the crew of 10 would've had, and the immense success of Apollo 8, due in no small part to the crew, had NASA wondering if it would be smart to just send them up again for the landing.

I had never heard this speech until the documentary, so I thought it was interesting to see a lighter side of one of the most infamous Presidents in American history.",ayhuw3
eku9j17,The reason why Nixon's call to them was so short was because Frank Borman (Apollo 8) advised him to keep it short. They had the opinion that the whole moon mission was Kennedy's legacy and didn't want Nixon to make it about himself. He actually had something longer planned originally.,ayhuw3
eidfq6d,"For the rockets and equipment themselves, there's a really in depth series called Moon Machines that's available on YouTube.

For the 50th Anniversary of NASA there was a series titled When We Left Earth:The NASA missions that has a lot of Interviews with all of the astronauts that were still around in 2008, detailing from Mercury to the start of the Shuttle missions. Irmember really liking that one. I rember the Apollo 10 segments being particularly interesting because the crew speaks about technically having all the tools for a suicide mission landing if they had wanted to.",ayhuw3
eiyroz8,"Before Apollo 11, I considered In the Shadow of the Moon as the gold standard. I've tried to see every Apollo documentary and that exceeded them all by as much as Apollo 11 exceeded that. It was similar in that it had a lot of previously unseen footage but different in that the footage was - not necessarily narrated by - but augmented by the astronauts sharing their perspective. I think that difference is what makes both films incredible in their own right - the personalized context of In the Shadow of the Moon and the immersiveness of the non-augmented Apollo 11.

The soundtrack for both were amazing too, in very different ways. In the Shadow of the Moon had more of a calmer ""wonder"" feel and Apollo 11 obviously went in the direction of intensity.

Edit for trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9d9-pHZzIE",ayhuw3
ejxfzp8,Don't forget that 14's CSM almost couldn't dock with the LEM. IIRC 16 also came within literally seconds of an abort at one point too. ,ayhuw3

ej7ueuh,"Of course I want everyone to get their due, women and POC deserve recognition. But if Von Braun really DID make all this achievable, there's no need to hide that. Just add the appropriate footnotes that he had a checkered past with the Nazis. Provide context instead of wiping him from history.",ayhuw3
et5k489,"I know this comment is old, but that was Günter Wendt.  He asks if they need any adjustments on their straps, and they say no, then ""thank you Günter"".  They just pronounce it closer to ""gunner"".",ayhuw3

ei39zgt,"> Maybe the text/graphics were generated using 1969 equipment just like the music.

what? ",ayhuw3
eiam6fb,"Apparently digital IMAX is a little over 3K because of how they align the dual projectors.  

And all the text in trailers and the IMAX pre-roll look really sharp.  It was just the text in the film that looked low-res.  ",ayhuw3

ei28xed,"I for one can definitly say this is not true. This event was capturing the whole world. 

the 1995 Apollo 13 movie is very popular over here in Asia and still get reviews from time to time. Other space centered movies like the martian and gravity were both well received.

We also have movies like the birth of a nation that is a lot more US centric.",ayhuw3
ej7v3bf,Didn't you love the shot of the guy filming the takeoff? He had that huge contraption and he was looking through like a periscope viewer to guide the camera(s).,ayhuw3

ei92i40,"I'll admit, Apollo 11 wasn't even on my radar until I read your posts. Then I looked it up, realized there was an IMAX playing it a few miles from my house, and said why not. I'm very glad I went, it was a fantastic film, and definitely worth seeing in a theater as opposed to at home.",ayhuw3
eogorsc,"I'm asserting that at 10% of the population (in 1969, and 13% currently - whoa, huge difference), you wouldn't expect there to be loads of them in this footage, regardless of circumstance. And again, what is the relevance to this documentary?

To quote you: What does that have to do with anything?",ayhuw3
ei1pgp7,It was weird for me too. I was easily the youngest person in my theater when I saw this (25 too). Next youngest person was probably 15 years older than me. I really wish and hope more people see this movie if it’s re-released this summer ,ayhuw3
ei1pkwh,Such a good sequence. Absolutely. ,ayhuw3
ei9c2jm,"Well, most students have the day off at least.  ",ayhuw3
ei6w1fx,"They are all docs that are created solely through archival footage. No talking heads or cliche / unnecessary exposition. LA 92 is the most masterfully constructed of the bunch imo though I haven't seen Apollo 11 yet. June 17th, 1994 focuses on the OJ white bronco chase and quite a number of other major events that happened that same day. LA 92 focuses on the LA riots. 102 mins is about 9/11",ayhuw3

ei40wqf,A 40-minute edited version is coming back this summer. It will be on IMAX screens at science centers and museums.,ayhuw3
ei54x59,Then I was wrong. I just read all over Neon's promotions for it that IMAX was one-week only. Maybe some theaters decided to carry it over but I'm sure the vast majority dropped it.,ayhuw3

ei2iq0k,"Think about how many Americans care anymore about space travel. 

Now think about how many of those people care about other countries. 

Finally, think how many of that subsection of a subsection would pay money to go see a documentary about it. 

I would also love to see other countries' space efforts, but at the end of the day it's a film and studios want films to make a profit. Why spend the money to market and distribute a film in a market where people care even less than the country it was originally made for. 

This is already a niche documentary that's only in so many theaters, and it's about to be swallowed by Captain Marvel. I'm answering why I think it WASN'T released internationally, not why I think it SHOULDN'T be released international.",ayhuw3
eogrthw,"This is a discussion post about the movie, this is something the movie made me think of. I’m not sure why you find that irrelevant. 

I didn’t say I expect “loads” of people of color, but just three is much fewer than I’d expect even at ~10% of the population; there are hundreds (maybe thousands, with the crowd scenes) of people in the footage.",ayhuw3
ei1pqcy,"> if it’s re-released this summer

I’m hoping so, it’s too bad Captain Marvel will take all the IMAX theaters this weekend, and to bring it back in July to coincide with the dates would be amazing - is definitely see it again. ",ayhuw3

ei1q2oh,"I really couldn’t see why they wouldn’t. The moon landing is one of the biggest achievements in the history of mankind, and there are two absolutely amazing films that just came out that help give greater perspective on the mission.
