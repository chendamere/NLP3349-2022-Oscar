hbedpqy,"The fight choreography was by far the best in MCU movie IMP. The blending of a ""kung fu"" and ""super hero"" was awesome.

hbegomc,"Two words.

TONY LEUNG.

Hopefully audiences will be interested to discover more of his work after this. Easily one of the best elements of the whole thing. It's his relationship with Simu that fuels the final act and keeps the big CGI battle from feeling too stale.",pgw0wk
hbemx6p,"After all the fan complaints of not getting ""the real Mandarin"" in Iron Man 3, this has turned out to be the better path. It opened up the character for this film.

Tony Leung said he was given freedom to make the character his own and didn't research the comics or anything. And I think that was a good thing. It felt like such a good, nuanced character. We don't always need ""comic-accurate"" for great characters and stories.",pgw0wk

hbebu53,"The two big fight sequences in in the first half (bus sequence and side-of-building/scaffolding sequence) are really great. Some peak action scenes for the MCU, and really sold Shang-Chi for me.

Simu's ability to carry an action scene, plus the character getting the ten rings, and the setting-up for him with the ending/credits scenes... I'm excited for where he'll go next.",pgw0wk

hberc21,"I FEEL SEEN AS AN ABC (American Born Chinese). Taking shoes off before entering a home? Of course. Eating jook (porridge) with the family? Have eaten it more times than I can count. Getting asked what my Chinese name is? Heard that before. Saying I don’t speak Chinese and only understanding bits and pieces? It me. Grandma asking if you’re going to get married yet?! It’s like they wrote about my life. 

I loved how personal the story felt, both for the plot progression and for its intimacy to Asian culture. They packed some good zingers in there too. I’m excited to see how they’ll incorporate these characters into future MCU storylines!",pgw0wk

hbelr6l,Tony Leung lived up to every ounce of his reputation. Dude killed it in his role as villain/husband/father.,pgw0wk
hbedfve,[deleted],pgw0wk
hbghi6t,"I think the thing that is so attractive about this story is how fantastically human they are. First off, the mother and father’s love was real. It was a real love story. He was so lost looking for power for a thousand years only to realize it was love that he was looking for. He found it and was ready to die for it. Gave up his immortality to grow old with her. To have a family with her. He was complete. And so was she. But his karma caught up to him. His past came for him and he wasn’t there. But his family was. I don’t think he really blames Shang-chi in that ending scene. I think he was mad and rash but because of how he responds in the end, he knows it was all his fault. He couldn’t come to the village because his past, so she gave up her powers. And his past actions killed his wife. He really loved her and really researched how to find her. I think the thing that’s so beautiful about this story is the master level of writing and acting in Tony Leung’s character. He really did change. He could have become a hero, and you could argue he did in the very end. Her love did that. I hope Shang-Chi 2 is finding his soul in what ever dimension it’s trapped in so it can be reunited with his love.",pgw0wk
hbfepln,"* Great action set pieces - the bus fight was the standout, but each made use of unique environments that added a different dynamic to each fight
* Tony Leung absolutely sold all the dimensions of Wenwu - the immortal conquerer, the listless ruler, the agonizing father, and the grim antagonist. And in his last glance to Shang-chi, the transition from helplessness to acceptance to pride. Definitely would say Wenwu ranks in the top tier of MCU villains - among Loki, Thanos, Kilmonger
* The 10 rings are officially one of the coolest weapons in the MCU. Great visual payoff to see Shang-chi blend his mother's fighting style with the usage of the rings in the last fight
* Trevor and the Planet of the Apes, amazing
* Razorfist's upgrade


A few surprisingly dark moments for an MCU movie, but they added to the story overall. I wonder whether Shang-chi's assassination mission will have further ramifications or be explored more in future films. One of the best MCU movies in the past few years, and probably the best origin movie since the first Guardians",pgw0wk
hbef6hh,"Katy giving Shaun shit for barely changing his name cracked me up. Awkwafina and Simu were awesome in this, looking forward to seeing more of them",pgw0wk
hbeikpw,"Some thoughts...

* As somebody living in Asia Simu's been getting a lot of flack for his looks and not being a well known actor. All these haters can eat crow because he was great in this movie. I feel like the writing could have highlighted him more in dialogues. He seemed a little stiff like Thor in Thor 1/2 than Thor in Ragnarok
* Tony Leung stole the freaking show, his acting was on another level. This isn't a shot at Simu Liu since the focus on the movie was about the passing of the torch. In a sense it seemed like Tony was the ""original Shang-Chi"" and Simu took over at the end of the movie.
* I'm not sure what I feel about Awkwafina's character. Katy was just there to push expositions and make comments, then gets shoehorned in as a contributing archer at the end. I don't know if Katy is in the comics, so I'm not sure what the plan is for her in future Marvel movies
* Appreciated Ben Kinglsey showing up and contributing to the story as Trevor. He really helped my girlfriend understand how Shang-Chi tied into the overall Marvel universe (Before the after-credit scenes). I hope we'll see him come back from time to time in future Shang-chi films
* Love that 30% of the dialogue was in mandarin. As a mandarin speaker some of the dialogues were a bit awkward but it's definitely one of the best I've seen in a Western film
* Pacing was a little bit off for me, in the first half it felt like it was just a series of ""this happened, ok now we go here for this, now we go here for this"" all in quick succession. When they went through their training montage in the third act, it felt like they trained there for a while when it was only a day
* The last fight with the soul sucker and the dragon was amazing from a visual standpoint, but I was kind of hoping for more Shang-chi fighting something with his new-acquired powers
* A lot of the mythical creatures come from the [Classic of Mountains and Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas). As a Chinese person I didn't even recognize some of them, so I learned even more about my own culture through this movie so that was something I appreciated
* Wong singing Hotel California somehow completed me, I'm glad he got some quality air time in this film",pgw0wk
hbeao2b,"Not surprise by the Brie Larson cameo, considering she’s a frequent collaborator of the director",pgw0wk
hbrngej,"Just want to say I felt personally attacked when Katy was carrying the dragon arrows in Ta Lo and talking about how she admires how they know what they want to do in life while she just gets ""moderately good at something"" before quitting and doing something new because she doesn't want to disappoint herself. I know it's super random, but that line stuck to me.",pgw0wk

The fights had me glued to the screen. Reminded me of the Jackie Chan movies of my childhood.

hbfnjxk,"A lot of folks are specifying that this is one of the best origin stories in the MCU, but I honestly think this is just straight up one of the better films in the MCU. 

Top tier fight choreography, funny in a lot of parts, all the insane visuals (the creatures, the rings, etc.), one of the great villains. 

It’s astounding to me that the MCU continues to put out bangers like this this far down the line. 

People will continue to claim superhero fatigue before each new film, and I understand that not everyone is into it and obviously not every single MCU movie is a gold star 10/10, but they continue to show how good they are at this over a decade later. I love it.",pgw0wk

hbeb6yo,"Destin Daniel Cretton really elevates this movie with the family drama. It's not surprising based on his past films, but it's just great how emotional this made me. Making The Mandarin Shang Chi's dad was the perfect decision, and he wasn't an over the top bad guy, he was a legitimately great villain with an appropriate redemption.",pgw0wk

hbebvwl,"I always wonder if and how much Venmo had to pay for a quick shout out in a movie, possibly as big as this.",pgw0wk
hbeaix0,"Honestly, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. The fighting is really well done, it's a bit silly, a bit whimsical, very pretty, and I thought a lot of the side characters had a surprising amount of depth for the kind of movie that it is. 

The action in this movie feels great. Some of it is Crouching Tiger style dancing and some of it is hard hitting Kung Fu. The set pieces were really cool, I think the scaffolding fight on the exterior of the skyscraper is one of the cooler action scenes I've seen in a while. And there were some impressive long take moments that even if goosed by CGI were still pretty amazing. 

I really liked that Awkwafina was kind of an atypical love interest, and that their relationship wasn't as physical or overt as pretty much any other movie like this would play it. She had use in the movie as the driver even before she picked up a bow, and I'm honestly excited to see her react to other MCU characters in future movies. I also thought ""If you aim for nothing, you hit nothing"" was a great little lesson and a good way to give her a nice little arc.

But I think the father was the most interesting character. At first I couldn't buy that a woman like the mother fell for some greedy military dick, but they ended up selling it well when he was explaining how he had finally found something worth growing old for. The last half of the movie is just sad for him. He wants so badly for it to be his wife calling him from the gate that he becomes obsessed and puts everyone in danger. 

And then you have the light stuff which I thought mixed really well into the story. I loved that Kingsley was around for more than one scene and the ridiculousness that was Morris. I loved how Ta Lo was much more nature based in their power than the obvious comparison of Wakanda who were more technology based. 

Overall, I was quite impressed. My only let down was that I wish the ~~Kabuki~~ Beijing Opera mask trainer was more of a present villain because that was a wild look and even the way that actor moved was kind of terrifying.  I think Marvel still has a lot to offer us in the coming years because this felt very fresh to me. I'd give it a solid 7/10. Maybe an 8, honestly.

I mean we’ve had Asgard and the 9 realms, and mysticism/magic of Doctor Strange and Wandavison … but that’s always been cased in the reality of “our universe”. Asgard is (was) a planet just with an amazingly advanced civilization capable of long life…. Doctor Strange’s and WandaVision’s magic outright takes place on Earth like Harry Potter.

But omg, as a Chinese living in Asia. This movie literally screams Chinese Pride/Asian Pride. The stereotypical romantic scenes portrayed in the father and mother fight scenes. The hong kong triad plot line. The grandma asking when are the two of them getting married. The favouritism of male over female. The mystical creatures nian, the Chinese dragon. The qi gong(chi for those in western countries) the movements, all are well executed! NOT TO MENTION THE SOUNDTRACKS, the fusion of Chinese instruments in the orchestral scoring, also the style of the music. Also them just speaking in fluent mandarin! I was always wondering why in the black panther movie, there was so little wakadian languages spoke(maybe due to it being a fictional country) but man I was so happy my mother tongue was spoke for a large portion of the movie especially when there are just Chinese people in the scenes. Also with the ABC Katy, this is so true cause not only in America, westernised society like Singapore and Malaysia, even the youths are starting to lose touch with their mother tongue.

Seriously though this was great. It may not be the genuine article in terms of kung fu and wuxia cinema but it's definitely I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of Cheez Whiz. They cared about getting it as right as they could inside the MCU framework.

Wenwu was far more sympathetic than his canonical antecedents. Zheng Zu has always just been a pure asshole (and in the Fu Manchu days super racist as well.) I seem to recall the Mandarin being slightly better in terms of occasionally having legitimate grievances and a vision for a better world, albeit one where he's the only one who gets to decide what's ""better."" Still an asshole, of course.

A warlord who tried to reform and was driven to his greatest evil by demonic lies promising the return of the only person who ever brought him peace... that's a tragic villain I can feel for.

I found the main family conflict was compelling and extremely well-delivered by all actors involved - and Awkwafina and Wah Yuen were also great. I loved how much it slowed down once they got to the mother’s village and gave screentime to every side of the story, especially to Wen Wu’s. 

As the credits rolled I thought about how completely packed this movie was with characters and worldbuilding, and Destin Daniel Cretton did such a great job of streamlining it and making even the periphery characters serve the main conflict. With MCU movies minus *Ragnarok* and the *Guardians* movies I typically end up getting bored from about the halfway point on, but the development of the characters and the whole third act really kept me invested. Specifically fleshing out Shang-chi as it went, showing the darker side to his own personal history in some great sequences, felt extremely refreshing. Simu played the character true note-for-note - I was a lil emotional to see him come all the way from the convenience store to this.",pgw0wk

The amount of Mandarin Chinese spoken throughout surprised me, and there was so much inspiration taken from Asian culture and background but done so well and carefully.

I’m so happy to see Asians represented on the big screen, no lie but me and my family were the only Asians in my theatre screening (although we watched it in morning and I live in the UK) and seeing everyone else laugh along and also enjoy this movie really moved me.

That shit was terrifying.",pgw0wk
hbeeveo,"I have missed Sir Ben Kingsley in movies so much. The man can steal any scene.

Also speaking of stealing scenes… TONY LEUNG! The dude absolutely crushed the role. Incredible, heart breaking performance. I felt bad for Wenwu. Also my dude’s final outfit was too amazing for this world. He looked so badass it put everyone else to shame.

hbmzteo,"As others mentioned one of the best origin movies and easily one of the best villains. 

It's a shame he died but I'd imagine he'd make further appearances in sequels in some form or another. I also love how his English accent is so different from when he speaks Cantonese. But when he talks, you can't not be fixated on him. 

Even him falling in love shouldn't have worked as well as he did. Leung is easily miles ahead of everyone involved though Kingston had the best laugh with his Planet of the Apes scene.

It didn't really bring many surprises and was largely formulaic but I appreciate how much more effort was put in compared to more recent origin stories to feel different. 

I enjoyed the little references throughout, my favourite being the Oldboy side view during the bus fight. Not really sold on Katy being so involved but Wong is very much welcome. The sister also felt really off as well, though it looks like they're setting her up to make another appearance.",pgw0wk

As Tony is already a huge star in Hong Kong and Asia, he has become the main reason for people to watch this movie in Asia. For us, some even say he overshadowed the main character. And, the promotion in Asia is mostly about Tony.

So, I am wondering how do people from Western countries think about him. Is the reception different from Asia? Is he that well-known too in the West?",pgw0wk
hbeqgvy,"Just saw the film and I was definitely blown away. As an Asian-American living in the West, it feels certain times that we are invisible. I understand Reddit's disdain to the CCP and the 'forced' diversity that Hollywood is moving towards. 

But watching this film was like when your parents first saw Christopher Reeves fly as Superman. Shang-Chi running on the back of the scales of the Great Protector to destroy Soul Sucker Bahamut was my Superman flying. 

I didn't expect to tear up as much as I did when Cap first held Mjolnir in End Game and I'm happy to have that experience again watching Simu Liu as Shang-Chi. 

This is definitely one of my favorite Marvel films to this date, I cant wait for more. [It was just nice to win one](https://streamable.com/bhlhix)

Couple thoughts on the film:

* Fight choreography was amazing despite not being pefect. Simu Liu, Tony Leung (or his stunt double), Meng'er Zhang, and Andy Le (Death Dealer) all did great on their fighting choreography. 

* I appreciate the lack of shaky cam and opting to use a wider shot. The camera angles and positioning also complemented the fight scenes. There are times that it did look funny but at least you're not using shaky cam as a crutch.

* Tony Leung carried this film in the middle part. I almost forgot about our protagonists whenever he's on screen. His acting is phenomenal it's a priviledge to see him behave in certain ways. He was able to be ruthless and at the same time show empathy. Tremendous acting.

* I preferred if Ta-Lo was not CGI but it was probably easier for them to CGI in the animals. It was obvious that that grass they stepped on was CGI and it just didn't feel realistic to me as the location where Wenwu and his wife first met. (Obviously because they actually made a set).

* I'm a Marvel guy but I do enjoy DC and their stories. I'm not a big Marvel is better than DC or vice versa, I just like good stories/movies. But somebody in DC fucked up with their cinematic universe when they're struggling to make DCEU movies while Marvel is at a point in Phase 4 where the Black Widows are fighting under Xu Xialing's new Ten Rings. Like what?

* Akwafina was actually pretty great on screen and isn't obnoxious. I thought she was going to be a Harley Quinn character and just say random shit for giggles. But she's a great complentary side kick to Simu' 'Shawn' character and definitely have great chemistry on screen.

* Pretty dope that the MCU's like 'Hey motherfucker, time to get serious, you're part of the Avengers now or working with us'. Can't wait for the sequel and hope we get some Fing Fang Foom. (Maybe he's the Great Protector's cousin that was suppose to protect Ta-Lo but coundn't find his purple pants so he lost his shot).

* Wong and Abomination was cool to see. Looks like they're in good terms, I wonder if they ever show what happened between 08 and now.",pgw0wk

hbs4x6d,"I just want to take a moment to say what a master actor Tony Leung is. It's criminal he will be overlooked by the awards shows for daring to be in a genre picture, but the way he carries the emotions on his face is continually stunning.

From the first fight with his wife where he falls in love, to the dinner scene where he's explaining the backstory to Katy, you can see every moment directly on his face, even if you can't understand the language.

It is a master class in action and elevates the film in every scene he is in.",pgw0wk
i73wz0p,"Thought the movie was ok. I thought Tony Leung was the highlight of the film, he pretty much oozes charisma every time he was on screen. 

If he was a few decades younger, he'd definitely be a better Shang Chi than Simu Liu was. 

Awkwafina was alright and I hate awkwafina's style of performing. The writers and directors did a great job containing her.",pgw0wk
hbed9ml,"Really enjoyed how much this felt different from a typical MCU movie. The fight scenes were very well choreographed, and the pacing felt right. 

Awkwafina and Simu were both way funnier than I expected as well, the first 30 minutes of the movie had the entire theatre laughing multiple times and everyone was on the edge of their seats. 

Definitely in my top 3 for MCU movies for sure.  9/10

Just realized I had one burning question that never got answered. How did Shang-Chi go from a runaway assassin to being a kid with no family in school? Was Katy's family looking after him? I wish it had talked a bit about HOW he got to where he was besides ""ran away to start a new life"".",pgw0wk

hbiulrc,"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it’s the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It’s also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.

The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it’s very well done and I didn’t think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it. 8/10",pgw0wk
hbezkz3,"Anybody else feel like they got more than they paid for? There was like a movie-and-a-half’s worth of plot, action sequences, exposition, and character development jammed into 2 hours. This seriously could have been Shang-Chi and Shang-Chi 2.

hbf1cdy,Yo these might be the best fighting scenes in marvel history,pgw0wk
hbf6pjv,"Really liked it. 

Black Widow let me down in a major way so I'm glad Shang-Chi was there to right the ship for me. 

With the exception of the third act which I enjoyed but felt could've been a little tighter, this movie hit the right notes for me. I grew up on Jackie Chan and was really young when my Dad first showed me Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon so HK Action Cinema has always been a thing for me. Once Simu said the magic words ""I don't want any trouble"" I knew I was gonna have some fun. 

The action scenes in this movie were easily the best of the MCU so far. While it doesn't eclipse the emotion of WS vs Cap and Cap vs Iron Man in CW, the flashy nature of the action and the overall cinematography far surpassed either of those scenes. And holy shit was it better than the fight scenes in Black Widow, I felt fucking sick watching those scenes. 

I like that they didn't go for the easy ""I didn't kill the target"" story beat and revealed that Shang-Chi did actually complete the job but couldn't bare the guilt so he stayed in America. It also explains why he was not afraid to ice a motherfucker when they came to harm him. 

I really enjoyed Awkwafina and Meng'er Zhang as well, I was surprised that Awkwafina got in on the action in the end. Zhang was really cool in her role, though the Girl Boss undertones did make me chuckle, damn you Lindsay Ellis. I can't tell if the Ten Rings are still going to be evil or if she's going to reform them but either way I like it. 

Wenwu is probably my favorite villain in an MCU movie. Honestly, his motivation is so well played that he barely qualifies as a villain, just a really shitty parent. You really got the sense that despite him turning Shang into a killer, he really does love his children and wants nothing more than to keep playing DDR with his kids. 

Overall, 8/10. Third act got a little too fucky for me but was saved by the Dragon fight tbh.",pgw0wk
hbf6aoe,Destin has quickly become one of my favorite directors. Phase 4 is Marvel at its best imo this was great,pgw0wk
hbhdslz,"Wonderful film. Very engaging story. Fun characters. Easily the best action sequences in a Western film I've seen in a very long time. Its funny cuz I was having a conversation with a friend on why anime will never work live action. This film gave the closet thing to anime-like fighting. 

The story had some powerful themes, all of which were executed very well. The power of love, the power of loss, grabbing hold of your destiny; all of these shaped our heroes (and villains) motivations and goals. At the core of it all, shang-chi is a powerful family drama.

I love that there wasn't a joke every second like The Suicide Squad. I'm really getting tired of the incessant jokes in these films and Shang Chi definitely brought things down to a more mature level. 

I really like how they tied up the Trevor Slattery arc. I was really annoyed with how The Mandarin was a fake in Iron Man 3, but Shang-Chi brought it full circle and did more than enough to explain that whole situation. Furthermore, the ties to the greater cinematic universe were also well done.

There are definitely a few things I took issue wit, like Awkafina's over the top personality, but none of it hurt the film.  Shang Chi is easily one of the best solo films of the MCU. I'd say it sits firmly next to Black Panther as a highly enjoyable self contained story that feels like its own but also feels a part of the MCU. 

Absolutely stoked for a sequel!",pgw0wk

hbweq0t,"Just saw the movie and I was pleased.  One thing I'd have to say is that Marvel/Disney f*cks around with the emotions of certain demographics that their movies are geared towards.  As an Asian male, what hit home and tugged the heart strings was shang chi's father's death.  It was such a parallel to see a father who is so stubborn, wrong, delusional, and controlling, yet he truly loves his son.  My daughter and I both saw my dad/her grandfather in the mandarin during his death scene.  The loving Asian mother trope I'd imagine might be a draw to Asian males who wished for an affectionate, loving mother.  This kinda hit home as my mother is cold and unaffectionate.  Anyways, thats marketing 101; disney/marvel for you.   Black Panther probably did the same thing for the African-American demographic.",pgw0wk

I honestly don't know if I would find Shang-Chi that interesting of a movie without him in it.

The fights are great, a bit too fancy and showy for my taste nowadays (seen too much of these kungfu movies) but refreshing for MCU/western viewers I suppose.

Side note though, it’s pretty funny that the Ten Rings is like the third or fourth “secret assassin organization that’s been influencing global politics for decades (or in this case centuries)”.

**Major spoilers, please stop reading**.


My partner and I felt like the sister was treated like an afterthought though. Isn't in the first handful of scenes with the mother, so you're kind of surprised he has a sister, and then gets probably less than 2 full minutes of dialog the entire movie. Could have completely written her out of the script and still had the same movie.

We were saying that it's a shame you don't see them both fight there dad with their unique fighting styles, it would have established him as a greater threat, while also exposing the duality of their nature. Shang-chi does not want to kill his father, xialing does and wants his empire, it sets up their inevitable conflict in the sequel where she wants the power of the 10 rings to herself.

Imo they should have established her more to make her betrayal even remotely surprising or have her come out of the shadows at the end of the movie to take over the 10 rings, and then give her respectful development in the sequel (true to her nature of operating and training in the shadows, driven by the hatred of her father and jealous resentment of her brother (his softness, which she views as weakness, thus setting up her self-superiority and justification for being the true successor of the 10 rings (and also what will ultimately be her downfall))

As it stands, she pretty much is an afterthought who had no real agency in the story.",pgw0wk

The ""Devolve"" into a CGI fight at the end wasn't as bad, to me, as everyone made it out to be. And/also, because of

Shang-Chi's father has been alive for a thousand years. He's had those rings for literally an entire millennia. In his dogged pursuit to ""rescue"" his dead wife, he allowed a giant soul-eating dragon monster to escape his prison.

And the second that monster breaks free, he both instantly acknowledges that he was wrong by tackling his son to save him from said dragon, but after literally never letting go of those rings for a thousand years... (Minus the time he was with his wife, ofc)

Passes them to his son. No hesitation.

One minor complaint from someone born in 97/98 is believing that Simu Liu was actually only 24 or even 25 if stretching it but he looks much older in my opinion.

hbkaqu0,"What a solid movie. Absolutely loved it, I know people's feelings towards Awkwafina being in there would be annoying but she was spot on. I love watching her act. 

All in all in pretty hyped and want more. I really digged the final scene reminded me of Kung Fu Hustle.",pgw0wk

hbllunt,"I spent the first half of the movie thinking how refreshing it was to have a Marvel movie where the fight scenes weren't busy CGI explosion battles. I spent the second half of the movie realising that's what it was turning into. 

I would have loved the dad/son fight to have been a no-rings, one-on-one fight with the choreography being the centre of attention. It would have been a great homage to Bruce Lee, Donnie Yen and Jackie Chan's work in martial arts movies. Then again, I'm a fan of martial arts movies in particular, so I can understand how others might not share my opinion.",pgw0wk

hr81y35,"I know I am late to jump the train (exams and prep) but this movie was real goooooooooooooooooooooood.

Thumbs up for the Asian casting and female representation. Start to end the movie had my attention and although it did not have that ""epic"" factor from endgame or even spider man 3, the execution pretty much made up for it. 

One thing I think most comic book-based movies miss is giving it that 'anything can happen- however unrealistic it may be' vibe. The movie tends to explain things that just happen in the comic. Sometimes it's not appealing to see reason in a movie that defies gravity. This movie found a weird balance between explaining things and leaving other things just in the air. It explained the dark gate and what the ten rings give the user but we never got to know how did the creatures behind the sealed gate talk to the ten rings wielder nor did we find the origin of the ten rings or from where does it draw its power or the fact that do we need all rings in the same vicinity for them to be useful or like 2-3 rings will do?",pgw0wk
hbebdx4,"This somehow feels like a Disney movie than a marvel movie in a good way of course. I personally LOVE seeing the mythical creatures battles in the 3rd act. 

Btw, those gotta be the creatures that was mentioned in the Eternals trailer right? And the rings probably some eternals tech or something since Bruce, Carol and Wong can’t tell exactly what it is.",pgw0wk

hbn8jna,"Fun fact about the bus scene - Air brakes work opposite to car brakes. In cars, when you depress the brake pedal, it is pushing down on the discs and slowing the car. With air brakes on buses, when the brake pedal is depressed, it releases air from the system which then pushes on the drums and slows the vehicle. So if all the air in the system was rapidly released as depicted in the film, the bus would have come to an immediate stop. It is designed to prevent this exact situation from happening.

hbefyqv,"I really enjoyed this movie and the biggest thing I wanna praise it for is giving us some fucking good action scenes. This is far and away the best fight scenes in any single MCU movie and I have been often critical, especially as of late, in Marvel Studios and their cut-heavy, choppy, and sometimes overly reliant on CGI action scenes. Shang Chi understood the fucking assignment and not only provides unique and inventive environments to have the action in but the camerawork isn't fucking up the action with the exception of a single scene that didn't last very long. This movie should raise the bar for MCU action. I want more fights driven on choreography and one of the best things about this one is it shows that even if you have characters with powers or powerful weapons you can still find a flavorful and stylish way to capture using them.

I do think that this is also one of the best origin movies of the MCU, and I'm also critical of origin films. There's a lot of exposition here but I think the pace of action made up for it and I felt like it was rewarding whenever new details or layers to the backstory of the characters were given. I liked the family themes going on in Black Widow and I like them here too albeit a different manner of family themes.

As for flaws, I found Awkwafina a little overdoing it at times. It didn't kill the movie for me but I was worried she might. I also think Wenwu's tragic villain had a bit of unrealized potential. It wasn't totally clear to me what was up with like, why he was hearing his wife so maybe I didn't catch that detail. These are minor flaws though, I really enjoyed Shang Chi as a character, he was surprisingly more relatable than I expected him to be from just how down to earth Simi Liu played him.

The early fight scene that's played like a dance is really beautiful and the bus scene sets the tone for the action to come. There are so many morsels of great martial arts scenes here that I just loved from Shang Chi fighting Death Dealer with all the weapon catches they were doing to the big battle that honestly could've gone a bit longer. 8/10 at least for me.",pgw0wk

Usually I drift off in my imagination while watching movies, no matter how good, but I couldn’t with Shang Chi. 

The only thing I wish was different is the english translations, which were sometimes off and didn’t convey the meaning behind the words properly, but honestly it didn’t bother me that much. Definitely just favorite Marvel film.",pgw0wk

It was absolutely awesome that ~30% of the movie was in Chinese (although the subtitles were a bit off sometimes), it's a film I'd bring my old Chinese parents to as they love the actors and actresses - the person that played Shang Chi's dad is one of the most famous actors in China according to my mom.

So happy with how Marvel handled the first Asian American superhero, it wasn't perfect but I actually got pretty emotional seeing someone like me on the big screen.

They're speaking German in situations when they are expected to speak German, French in French situations, and English in English situations. Compare that to a movie like Valkyrie, where despite a German setting with German characters, the actors are speaking English.

I think that's definitely an extremely underrated part of this movie. The actors are speaking Chinese where you would expect them to and there's always a good reason why they would converse in English. Even things like Wenwu asking toddler Shang if he's learning English before having an English conversation make this movie feel really authentic. And it definitely helps of course that the actors are fluent in Chinese.",pgw0wk

I see why they took it out because the father turned out to be a more complex character than pure evil, but I don’t think the movie did a good job showing the full relationship between father and son.  When the father gave up his rings at the end it didn’t really hit home as it should have.",pgw0wk
hbifnly,"Okay this movie is okay and by that I mean that its good in the way Marvel movies are. It's well paced and balanced between the action and the break from the action for the story. It's way better than Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 for example but not at the same level of Dr. Strange for me.

Besides the main character of Shang-Chi I thought everyone was fantastic and especially Awkwafina who could have easily been an annoying side character but she isn't. Just pitch perfect balance of funny and reactive to sincere. Simu Liu wasn't very emotive and seemed to have to be carried in every serious scene. He felt he was there just for the fights.

CGI was kinda not good at the beginning but then it really kicked up to high gear for final half, and on top some great cameos you should watch it.",pgw0wk
hbiw2gn,This movie rules,pgw0wk
hbiw6x8,"From the trailers I had assumed Xialing was just a minor side character for him Shang-Chi to fight, so her being his sister and bigger part of the story was nice to see as a sucker for sibling relationships in movies and shows. She also definitely got the better outfit at the end.

hbsu2qf,"Not the biggest MCU fan, but I was pleasantly surprised by this, nothing amazing but a solid, fun time. Definitely thought it was one of the better MCU offerings, especially of late. All the hand to hand stuff was fantastic, with the bus fight being my favourite action piece in any MCU film. Cast did a solid job as well. My biggest gripe is that the final fight sequence just didn’t do much for me. I thought it dragged on for far too long, a lot of the CGI on the dragons and the environment looked a bit wonky, and it veered too far away from the fantastic choreography present in the earlier film and ultimately fell into the MCU trap of a poor third act. Sometimes less is more, and I think I would have preferred it if the climatic fight was between Shang-Chi and his father, but I do understand why we got what we got, and by no means did it ruin the film for me. 

Also as a Brit, I saw a lot of people talk about how much they liked the “I speak ABC” line  and I feel it was a bit lost on me, is that a cultural thing that I’m out of the loop on?",pgw0wk
hbt0utk,"Enjoyed the movie throughout. Definitely one of the top MCU movies for me. I love when they flesh out the villian’s backstory and Tony Leung brought his A game.

But at this point in his life, he has kids and his reversion to his old self is harming them. It's just amazing.

My only major (altho still not that big) complaint is I still don't understand why Marvel movies are always so muted with their colors on screen. Everything just washes together too often. There are scenes like the excessive black during the bamboo scaffold fight, or a lot of the Ta Lo fight scenes kind of washing into the green/brown backgrounds. So much of the lighting and cinematography is always kind of flat and sort of muddy. I will say I think this movie was a little better than previous Marvel films, but there's definitely room for improvement. 

I mean....this is a comic universe. Why not make things pop? My only guess is that it helps hide computer graphics that may be a little inconsistent in areas.",pgw0wk

This movie was partially shot during COVID, so I'm guessing Kingsley was in a studio in a different country. They get around this in 2 ways:

1 - the mirror behind Trevor has ShangChi and Katy pasted on it to give the sense of the characters being in the shot despite them not really being there

2- A wide shot of Shang and Katy reacting to Trevor and the monster (iirc) uses body doubles for Shang and Katy. It's very blatant if you're looking out for it, the camera is placed in a way that you see their whole bodies except heads, and the lighting on the characters is completely different to how they are lit in their shots",pgw0wk

Shang pulling off his jacket and using it to fight, then putting it back on was awesome. Awkwafina was absolutely hilarious during the plane scene, I laughed for a good bit.

hcmeliy,[deleted],pgw0wk
he4z3g7,"Really enjoyed the movie but I just wish they had given far more screen time to the emotional and character development of Shang-Chi. He has one of the darkest back stories of any Marvel protagonist but they portrayed his adult version as some easy-going 'average joe' type. How did he manage to integrate into American society alone, at age 14, with so little evidence of his trauma? I think diving more into how he coped, emotionally, with his past would have made more sense. The lightheartedness of Shang-Chi's life in America seemed incongruent with the gravitas of the entire back story related to his family and Ta Lo.

IMO, the profile given to Katy's character didn't make a lot of sense and took away from Shang-Chi standing out as a new leader in the MCU. While their relationship was cute, Katy appears to bring no more value/skills than Happy or Ned and probably should have been given a similarly lower profile. Like, what's the logic for inviting her to engage with the Avengers on the same level as Shang-Chi? Xialing or any resident of Ta Lo would have been a more valuable recruit. It just felt like the role Katy played in the story could have been fulfilled by Xialing which would have made far more sense and had a stronger emotional impact.",pgw0wk
hedihct,"The first half set up interesting family dynamics and for the most part the emotionally driven context landed. The second half disappointingly felt it had to justify another end-of-the-world scenario and descend into a tireseome CGI-fest.

Ta Lo was rushed, and in the end perfunctory. It was utilised only as a brief backdrop for a battle with no scale and minimal impact. At not one point did any real threat emerge and despite Marvel's attempt to feel fresh, it once again realied on tried and tested tropes with predictable outcomes. Never mind mythical creatures and world building. Put in a dragon that looks like it's from Asian culture. 

Our protagonist - strangely wooden and largely out-acted by his childhood counterpart - never delivered any emotional gravitas and the outcome of his journey didn't feel earned. His sister is another example of a Marvel character fleshed out only to the point of narrative relevance, then misused and cast aside in favour of humour, cheesey dialogue and a bombastic ending.

Katy. A character existing purely as a vessel for delivering corny humour in order to minimise any genuine dark or emotive content. An excuse to lift the mood whenever the narrative dares to tackle mature themes. Her existence in this movie is grating, un-eventful and... sigh... boring. Buoyed by the death of a cultural figure (and seemingly last remaining archer) in Ta Ho, it feels apt that an untrained, metaphor-less Katy delivers the key blow whilst the audience watches on, thoroughly whelmed. Another mild hit of dopamine. Another brain cell momentarily satiated. Another 'yay.'

'The Mandarin' cameo took yet more screen time that could be dedicated to genuine narrative and character development. Thank goodness the dodgy-accented cameo from Ben Kingsley existed. Who knows what we would have done without it. Our sage. Our guide. Our coincidence.

Marvel's attempt to integrate martial arts into its catalogue ends in a predictable 5/10 movie; its formula now extending outwards in an attempt to justify fading innovation. Given the classical source material available, one can't help but wonder why this ended up in such a mess.

Arguably, one doesn't have to wander far for the answer. Churning out movies is proving successful in the box office, and as long as they are diverse and entertaining enough for the audience to avoid delving deeper, they will continue to see success.

Shang-Chi exists entirely in the present. A movie that asks precisely nothing of your thoughts once it ends. If it has taken your money and delivered exactly enough convention and fan service to make you feel satisfied, it has seemingly succeeded.

A word, though, for Tony Leung, who carries his role with pure class.",pgw0wk
hkgzdhg,"The one thing that truly bothers me about marvel movies is how much unnecessary CGI they use. Like every fucking scene is green screen almost. The scene where Wenwu is explaining why he's trying to get to Ta Lo and they are just sitting at a table having a conversation and it's fucking green screened and it just sucked me out of the whole scene because it just didn't look quite right. We've reached kind of an uncanny valley type territory with green screen tech and personally I can't help but be a little put off by it being used in scenes that could easily be done with it.

I like that there was absolutely no romance between Simu and Awkwa. Not everything needs romance shoehorned in.

The dance fight between Tony Leung and the mom in the first scene was beautiful. 

The CGI and physics were poor at times but the final dragon v dragon fight was gorgeous.

This easily has my favorite action scenes in any MCU movie, only the original Avengers come close (say what you will about Whedon, that 3rd act is incredible). I love Marvel movies, but the constant editing and hard to define geography is a bit of a problem for me sometimes, but not with this movie. It's all crisp, clear, and fun. 

I'm a bit of a ""cinephile"" if you will, so when I heard that THE Tony Leung from In The Mood for Love was going to be in a Marvel movie, my hype was off the charts, and he so delivers. I really think he's a top 3 Marvel villain for me now. He was so incredible in this movie, and I just loved the way this film was shot.

This is easily a Top 5 MCU movie for me, it's my favorite solo film since Winter Soldier and my 2nd favorite solo film overall. This movie is so freaking good and I was really surprised by it!",pgw0wk

Also a big fan of the soundtrack. Could be wrong but I think they utilized the score with character development. The fight scene in the bus is set to electronic music then the fight club/scaffolding sequence felt orchestral, but then as Shang-Chi becomes himself the music is backed by Chinese instruments.",pgw0wk

I was certain they forgot about the Ten Rings plot introduced in Iron Man 1 or threw it out in favor of making them a joke. I did not expect it to come back as the full plot of the movie that actually brought *all of it* back including Ben Kingsley. What a crazy cameo.

New Mandarin was also really cool, I'm a big fan, and it makes me less mad about Iron Man 3. I kind of wish he had a cool supervillain name of some sort but being a total badass warlord is more than enough.",pgw0wk

hglbu74,What an absolute bore. How is this movie rated so highly? It's like it was made by AI - zero hooks or plot  turns. You could predict the whole movie just after the bus scene. Not sure why I'm surprised that a movie for Chinese audience is so increbly bland.,pgw0wk
hkm6zkc,"The martial art fight scenes in here are night and day difference if compared to Iron Fist, loved every bit of them.",pgw0wk
hlck9w9,"I'm very surprised this movie was rated so high. This film felt like a very high budget cheap flick. By that I mean it has many technical elements that make it feel expensive in that Marvel fashion like cinematography, set design, actors/actresses, music, and of course visual effects; but it's cluttered with questionable writing and plot holes abound.

Take for instance the scene where Wenwu dies. This is a man that has lived for hundreds of years whose soul is literally being sucked out by a terrible cosmic being *in front of his own son* whom he still loves. Also to note - for ten years he was being called by this being believing it was his dead wife which means he was also deeply betrayed mere moments ago.

And yet we're presented with a slightly surprised Shang-Chi and a Wenwu who appears slightly sad. All while the music seems to be oddly non-present. Then he flops down, Shang checks him to see if he's really dead, and off he goes.

There is a desperate reach between the situation that is occurring and how the characters are reacting. And that seems to happen too frequently in this movie. 

I get that what just happened is significant but in the last half of the film way too many people stood still to watch something off in the distance while their peers were still fighting. Maybe don't do that next time.

Parts I did like in this movie were some of the comedy bits. I thought it was brilliant that Trevor made a return. Most of the hand-to-hand combat was cool. And I guess I liked how they didn't pull punches with their use of Mandarin in the film.

Overall I thought this movie was a little bit above average.

6/10",pgw0wk
hlmlhpz,Worst Marvel movie I've seen in a long time. Awkwafina is the worst Asian actress I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. She has only made movies worse by being in them.,pgw0wk
hp72r28,didn't every ring has different abilities? why are they only using it like that? someone explain please,pgw0wk
ht9vk9h,"This movie has its problems mainly it being another marvel action superhero movie so it's bogged down by the universe. (I do like this movie i just have some problems with it.) Wong scenes are just distracting and seemed tacked on. Should have used those scenes to flesh out the rings and how they work. But since i've seen many of these martial arts movies, its fair to say the weapons don't matter its the person wielding them.  But it would still be nice to have a little scene explaining how they work and what shang chi must do to be worthy of them apart from being strong ofcourse.  

The villain is a mix bag because he's side showed by the cgi monster that wants to end the world.   He's another sympathetic bad guy instead of being pure mustache twirling villain. Which is a staple of hong kong Kung fu movies the evil warlord or king. Tony leung makes it work with little he has to work with, but let's be honest we were all rooting for him. This is the problem with movies in general today too afraid to have a scary evil villain that you hate.  This movie feels like other hollywood attempts at this genre noticeable bulletproof monk and forbidden kingdom but both those movies had the star power and even the mustache twirling villains. This is where the movie really annoys me, all that money and effects yet your main hero is bland and boring with a terrible costume. 

I've never read the comics but just by looking at the art work you can see a bruce lee 1970s influence.  Simu liu/Shang chi, is no bruce lee in fact he gets outshined by his better co star awkwafina(Yes people find her annoying)but she's a breath of fresh air compared to Simu lius performances. It's very shocking with so many asian american actors with actual martial arts backgrounds marvel picks a bland tv actor with 0 screen presence.  

If you haven't seen the tv series Wu assassins check it out, the story and characters are ripped straight from that. Even having the same father son dynamic done better and fleshed out by the way.  Now I like this movie for the most part but shang chi is such a bland boring character makes it very hard to rate it.  Just replace him with a jackie chan lite actor and you have a better movie.  

The rings and tony leung are the best parts in my opinion but it would be a disservice to dismiss the stunt team and special effects teams they put a lot of effort and it shows. Hopefully marvel can take note and go back to how movies used to be made with nice wide shots no shaky cam and a good stunt team. Many people adore the russo brothers but their movies are filled with awful camera work and quick fast editing. This movie shows us with effort you can give the audience coherent action scenes that's easy on the eyes. Even the cgi battle at the end was easy to follow.",pgw0wk
i09qwbb,"""I like your spike face!""",pgw0wk

hbo0wkx,Tony Leung should've been the next all-around villain after Thanos goddamn. Fuck me he has the charisma.,pgw0wk
hbms3pc,"This may have ended up being my favorite Marvel film. Maybe it's the locations (I lived in Asia for several years, and it feels a bit nostalgic). Maybe it's the fact that the best friend/ comedic relief is also the love interest, and that dynamic is born from having things in common, as opposed to vague attraction. 

Maybe it was the awesome interpretation of Mandarin. Something we should have gotten a decade ago, if only Marvel/ Disney weren't terrified at the time to put an Asian in a leading role. The fact that we couldn't see this character on screen with Iron Man hurts my soul.

Maybe it was the action, and how amazingly kinetic it was. That scaffolding scene was insane!

I don't know... it wasn't perfect. The razor guy was pretty unnecessary, and some moments feel a bit rushed, but I just found this film to be such a delightful watch. It felt like an epic Saturday morning cartoon.

Liu was extremely likeable in the role as well. I can't wait to see more of these characters.",pgw0wk

hbek7dm,Marvel and the third act being a shit fest CGI. Name a better duo,pgw0wk

All the top comments be like ""better"", ""good"", etc, etc. I mean what the fuck is this sub anymore if not an echo chamber of MCU fanatics. Every Disney movie too, i have to sort by controversial to really see some interesting points.",pgw0wk
hbez9wh,"I think it's a fine movie and thought Tony Leung did great, but the third act really suffers from climax bloat. It's a difficult problem to solve because the movie was already long but there was just too much squeezed in right at the end with not enough room to breathe. 

It's just climax after climax after climax and it just becomes too much at some point. First you have the initial battle between the villagers and 10 rings. Then the battle between the father and son. Then the battle against the soul eaters. Then a second battle between father and son. Then a giant monster battle...then the final final battle where the big bad finally dies...",pgw0wk
hbkyudl,"This was alright. If anything, I hope this helps Simu Liu get more roles because I really liked him in Kim's Convenience.

Some things I liked were the fight scenes on the bus and scaffolding in Macau. I was never a fan of wire-fu so anything remotely Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon esque really took me out of it. Mandarin speaking characters spoke...Mandarin at places where it is expected. The action was pretty solid for the most part.

Some cons for me were the exposition heavy dialogue. Nothing really felt natural in learning/discovering something. It was always ""let me tell you a story"" or ""let's take a walk through this museum while I explain.."" or just random flashbacks. Didn't like that too much. 

I also don't really like how it devolved into a CGI beam fest towards the end with dragons and shit. I think at one point I saw a vortex of water, appendages, and just beams running amuck lol.

Katy also just being a ""natural"" with the bow and arrow was so wtf too. ""Hey, I only started today but can hit bullseye everytime"" I get they wanted Awkafina to have something to do but maaaan",pgw0wk
hbnwcjo,"Okay so this was an actual good Marvel movie in a long time. Tony Leung basically stole the show. Awkwafina wasn’t as annoying and actually had great comedic timing.

Because let's face it we aren't gonna get another Downey, Evans, or Hemsworth when he's all done. They are once in a lifetime castings and anyone that can match are gonna be too expensive to cast as a lead. 

Also, if MCU is going to continue ending their films with cg fests, then at least make it bonkers and interesting like this movie did.",pgw0wk

Obviously Awkwafina and everything in English for Western viewers, and Tony Leung (especially the line about eating more salt than Yuen Wah ate rice) for Chinese viewers, but even some stuff that is super relatable for Asian American viewers.

Not living up to immigrant parent expectations for one thing, but when they were in Macau and Ronnie Chieng said ""don't worry I speak ABC"" I cracked up. Turns out some people I watched with just thought he meant ABC as in the English alphabet, but ABC also stands for American Born Chinese. There's a prevailing perception (especially in Asia) that ABCs aren't really Chinese and don't speak Chinese or understand Chinese culture. It was just a throwaway line but showed what it's like to be dismissed and not really be accepted as Asian/Chinese but also not really accepted as American either.",pgw0wk

hbqmvwp,"This was pretty good but kinda started dropping off when they got to the village. I enjoyed the more grounded Kung-fu fighting over the dragon and fantasy stuff. I thought the villain was okay? I feel like that’s a hot take because leading up to the movie and reading this thread I kept seeing how incredible the bad guy was. I know his plan wasn’t to take over the world but that didn’t make him interesting to me. The actor did a great job with him but I felt we didn’t get enough time with the character. He’s obviously better than most Marvel baddies but that isn’t saying much. Katy and Shang-Chi were pretty good together. I thought they had good chemistry and I’m excited to see their next adventure. 

As far as origin stories go it’s not as good as Iron Man but I’d put it a smidge ahead of Black Panther and I think it’s quite a bit better than Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, and Captain Marvel.

heusvvy,"It's a tale of two different movies. First half is fairly good, great pace, some of the best action sequences in a Marvel film. The reveals are rather exciting, the set pieces are vibrant, and the stakes felt real. Like when Katy was hanging off the side of the building, there was a real sense of urgency there. It was also kind of nice to see Katy's family, their friends, their job. There was a lot of freshness in that first half.

Contrast that with the second half... and it got too heavy. Whatever spunk it has in the first half, it kind of just gets buried for familial drama and CGI heavy action. And Ta Lo for whatever reason, this magical place felt like it was put together by a bunch of VFX students.  Every set piece in the first half looked better than Ta Lo. And if we're talking about plot trajectory here, I'm not sure you needed to ham fist a beast from another realm into the story. There was more than enough meat to the bone without having to add that supernatural threat. Just let Shang and his father fight it out in Ta Lo.

hnyubvm,"I loved it : It’s one of my favorite MCU film and I was hella surprised by my reaction to it.

I guess it’s just the story that is delightful and generous : once the father and the mother start to Love-Fu, I know I was here for a treat. 

I didn’t mind the finale that I thought was actually glorious (the finish move was out of this world). However, I think the confrontation with the father could have been even more layered toward the end :

Shang hardly tries to convince his dad that he’s wrong. It could have increased the pathos if he truely shared everything he known about the portal, only for his dad to be too far gone to come back to reason. 
Or even better, the dad replies that if he’s wrong, this is not his first rodeo and he will handle what ever is behind the portal... only to later be crushed by his deception.",pgw0wk

hc9d4j2,"Nahhhhh dawg Shang Chi had no business being this damn fire what the fuck. I’m absolutely speechless. Coming into the film I was a little excited to see some Chinese representation in the MCU and in comic movies in general, but I wasn’t expecting to see Chinese mythology, culture and Confucianism explored so well.

The action sequences, direction, cinematography, everything was just perfect. It had the perfect balance of nods to the MCU and other marvel projects whilst also being its own thing and having its own story to tell. The casting was perfect, writing was immaculate and I couldn’t be more pleased with the overall production. This went from being an obscure super hero film for me to one of my top 3 superhero films.

We’re in year 13 of the MCU and marvel continues to innovate and show me new things. I’m excited for the future of the franchise. Externals and No Way Home this year… we eating good",pgw0wk
hbermqg,"Gotta be honest, I didn't like this one. So much clunky exposition throughout the whole movie. It almost never felt like the characters were having organic conversation. Awkwafina was awful. None of her lines were funny. The only time she made me laugh was when she shot the evil soul dragon days after picking up a bow and arrow for the first time. Speaking of the evil dragon, what the hell was that? It's just sort of introduced halfway through and then shows up as the big bad at the end, completely smothering the emotional climax of the movie, which is Shang-Chi fighting his father.

The fight scenes were well done, but they can't make up for a story that is both too simple and needlessly complicated. Why not just tell a straightforward family drama with martial arts and some fantasy elements? Why go through all the trouble of establishing an evil shadow dragon that's tricking the father to release him and end the world? Also, the movie just looked ugly. I don't know how it was for everyone else, but at my screening every scene had a bluish-grey filter over it, even Ta-Lo.

Look, I wanted to like Shang-Chi, and I went into it with an open mind, but it was a real letdown.",pgw0wk
hbeblks,"This movie grew on me as it progressed. At first it seemed dull and corny, with gratuitous use of characters and concepts of prior Marvel movies. But it all came together nicely. Credits scenes were solid.",pgw0wk
hbegqcy,"First act was solid but hampered a bit by some very clunky exposition and line delivery.

Second act was really slow, really dark (not like moody, but the lighting was really dark/excessive night time stuff that didn't let the scenery pop), and little more than long exposition dumps

Third act was amazing. Did stuff not yet seen in a Marvel movie, similar to the big ""whole new world"" jump that the first GOTG brought.

It wasn't a perfect debut but there's a lot of potential there and Shang Chi will be a great character going forward. In that sense it's a lot like the Dr. Strange movie.

My biggest criticism is that the third act felt like three or four TV episodes worth of world building, escalating tension, and character development crammed into a half-hour or so. Katy goes from a fish out of water to a master archer in the span of like three scenes.",pgw0wk
hbevvw8,"Enjoyable but really wish I liked it more. 

A little bit more exposition than I wanted. Dialogue was a bit cheesy at times (but that's more of a marvel problem). Disappointed that they kept awkafina as mostly a surrogate character... felt like a waste of her talent and definitely took me out of the movie at times.

They seemed to want to portray shang chi as ""lost"" but there wasn't enough setup in the beginning to make this convincing. 

But...simu liu was better than I thought. Low key charismatic and hit the right emotional notes throughout. Honestly think he can really carry this character for this next mcu phase.

Action scenes was mostly good (though it got a bit too cg towards the end) and reminded me of some old hk stuff.

And Tony leung...wow...man just stole the show. One of the more compelling mcu villans in a while. Shows his motivations without being too hamfisted. Intensely romantic. My only critique is that I just didn't buy him being ""scary"" the way awkwafinas character thought.

Anyways, decent start to the franchise,  better than most mcu origin movies. Looking forward to the next one!",pgw0wk

hc0mvgh,"What made this movie great wasn't necessarily the story (which to be honest, was a bit generic and predictable) but rather, the themes and the representation that it brought to its viewers. 

So many little things in the movie were completely relatable to Western-born Asian audiences and really normalized these experiences to show what we go through as ""inbetweeners"". Just being able to see an Asian main character standing with other members of the Avengers was such a surreal sight to see, and I had to even remind myself at times that this was actually a Marvel movie. 

Tony Leung was INCREDIBLE in the movie and made everything significantly better - the movie surely wouldn't be even half as good without him. 

I'm excited to see how this continues and am looking forward to how more representation like this will be normalized down the line in not only Marvel but media in general!",pgw0wk
hc2rvn8,"I enjoyed the first half immensely, but once they got to Tao Lo, I felt the pacing grinded to a halt, not to mention the CGI battle scenes and monster battles reminded me of Black Panther (in a bad way) and were inferior to the likes of the bus fight scene. 

I'm a big fan of Simu and I think he was good in the role, but I do feel he was overshadowed anytime he was on-screen with Tony Leung who was phenomenal. Awkafina was fine and I think they did a good job picking their spots with her one-liners. Shang-Chi's sister felt like an underused character despite her screentime. Overall: I enjoyed it quite a bit, but due to the uneven quality, I don't consider this to be among Marvel's best. 7.5/10.",pgw0wk

hc3swrk,I love how they portrayed Awkwafina as the most American Asian-American they could. The fact that they had her be the one that has to be taught how to pronounce Shang-Chi was fantastic.,pgw0wk
hbex03j,"Really did not like this one. Thought Black Widow was much better. I thought the strongest element was the father/son relationship, the martial arts choreography, and occasionally great cinematography. 

Everything else was pretty bad. The CGI was abysmal, half the film looked like it was on a cheap green screen. The jokes weren’t funny, and I know I wasn’t alone in this because even though the theater was packed like for Black Widow and Free Guy, those movies got WAY more laughs. Simu was good enough, his parents were pretty good. Akwafina was annoying and my audience didn’t find her very funny. 

Another movie that ends in a universe ending threat that comes out of nowhere and ends in a CGI-fest battle. The fights with his dad are cool, then you have to sit through shit that didn’t need to be there. Why do we need this crazy CGI dragon battle? The effective parts of this movie are grounded in a personal story with emotional flashbacks about a family, not lovecraftian soul-sucking demons. Save those for Shang-Chi 2 when we need to expire Ta Lo lore more.

Pointless villains. The knife arm guy was lame, and shang-chi is forced to fight nameless goons to fill time until he can finally face his dad. 

Armies of random people clashing with weapons, helpfully color coded in blue and red. It’s just silly, once again like Wandavision a Marvel property ends in colored energy battles back and forth. It’s so played out at this point. 

The girlboss stuff with his daughter was annoying, Marvel really cannot write good women. Seriously, she watched everyone else and taught herself better and then just started her own empire? When Katy pointed out how ridiculous her life story was, the response may as well have been “well I am a girlboss”. She has no character beyond helping Marvel get hit a quota, she gets no good scenes with her dad, Shang-Chi gets all that. the film can’t be bothered to give her anything legit to do. Seriously, what was she in this movie for??? I’m not saying she should be written out, she should be given something to do except just stand there and be like “I’m a powerful woman”. 

It’s still a complete mystery why he would’ve run away, why he would be the way he is when we meet him at the beginning. It’s a giant gap that makes no sense. The movie keeps revealing more towards the mission but by the time the film ends it makes ZERO sense why Shang-Chi would’ve felt the need to run away had he been successful, and why he would’ve thrown away the assassin life he was well-trained for and never showed an ounce of NOT enjoying in any flashback. 

Easily the worst Marvel release of the year so far. Hopefully Eternals is better",pgw0wk
hberonl,"I feel like I'm in the minority, but I just didn't really enjoy this one. I don't know. Nothing really impressed me. 

I'm shocked how these movies have such a huge budget and it just never shows. The visual effects were subpar for a lot of scenes to the point where it was distracting. I found myself bored for most of the first half but the second half when they got to Ta-Lo carried so hard. I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but for something that was supposed to kick off Phase 4, it left a lot to be desired. If it wasn't obvious yet, Marvel feels more corporate than ever.

hbkciyf,Am I the only one who thought the movie was mostly boring and felt like another soul-less Marvel movie with nothing really to offer?

hbeifp6,"I really enjoyed the film, I think it's an awesome flick. Same praise as everybody else: actors were great, action was phenomenal, the father's love story was far more touching than anyone could have anticipated. The story went in some really weird and cool directions. 

I could have done with way less CGI dragon monsters in the climax and could have done with way more emotional character moments in the climax. The moment where Shang-Chi and his father stop fighting and start talking, I thought that was going to be a powerful ending: Shang-Chi convinces his father that what he's doing is wrong and he needs to stop. But then nope, the dad had to see the giant CGI monster with his own eyes to realize he was wrong. And then when our main characters practically disappear while riding another giant CGI monster, I felt it all got a bit too much...but then they nailed the rest of the ending. 

I also would have liked for Katy to have more of an emotional impact on Shang-Chi somewhere in the climax. That scene with the two of them by the lake is great, where he commits to the darkness of having to kill his father and her being unable to come up with anything to say in response. I would have liked to follow up on that. Maybe she gets a pep talk from the aunt or something. Just something emotional to underline why Katy was still there in the movie as emotional support, not just her randomly taking up archery — though I very much enjoyed her getting a cool archery moment. 

Just some personal takeaways. I nitpick because I love.",pgw0wk

hbma9s2,"I was surprised by how much Chinese language there was in the movie, was expecting an American setting. Feels more like an Asian movie than an Asian American movie. The fight on the bus was really cool and perhaps the highlight of movie. Asian stereotypes were broken such as Asian women driving and masculine Asian men. I normally don't watch Marvel movies some parts felt really unneeded mainly Trevor Slattery, when he first appeared it kinda broke my immersion because felt so random. Xu Wenwu's motivation felt really silly and somewhat forced, it was illogical. I would expect someone who lived thousands of years to be smart. I thought movie was going to be about Shang-Chi surpassing his father (there's a Chinese phrase for that: 青出於藍), but then Soulsucker robs Shang-Chi of that opportunity. I feel like the first half of movie was stronger than 2nd half. Did Shang-Chi really grow as a character in movie? It's a great film, and I'm so happy that overseas Asians in the West can finally have their own superheroes, and that Asian children can have a superhero to look up to. For that reason, seeing yourself represented on the big screen, the Hollywood recognition that we exist, it's really satisfying. Awkwafina slayed in the film, movie definitely had plenty haha moments. I don't know the origin source so no idea if that limited movie or if movie is loosely based on that and mainly went its own route. Movie has some flaws, but I'm totally okay with overlooking them because movie is significant, Hollywood showing strong Asian Americans that aren't stereotypes. I was the only Asian in my theater, I feel like most of the audience are already Marvel fans as they were able to get Marvel jokes I didn't. So I can't wait to see more of Shang-Chi amongst Marvel and I hope movie shatters box office so we can have more films with Asian Americans!

hbz01g5,One of the many highlights of this film for me was when Wenwu gave a slight nod to the fake terrorist plotline in Iron Man 3 and how easy it was to manipulate the american public by playing with their ignorance and fears.

hbf2o5t,"I really really enjoyed that, going in without much knowledge of this hero, he has become one of my favorites. The creativity and use of the rings in fighting scenes left me so perplexed and giddy, I think back to iron man and Thor using caps shield for badass combinations and can’t wait to see how they incorporate the rings with other superhero’s. 

They packed a lot into this movie, but the flashbacks were timed quite well for it not to feel too overwhelming. I see a lot of people saying it was the typical marvel origin story but I didn’t feel that way at all. If anything the first two acts felt like Xu Wenwu’s origin story and it wasn’t until the third act (or at least when they get to Ta Lo) that I felt more invested in Shang Chi’s development. But it felt very 1A-1B throughout the movie with those two not feeling like one was more of a main character over the other. (Could also be because Tony Leung really stole the show)

The score was one of my favs in the marvel movies, felt like they nailed each scene being enhanced and complimented by the music. 

The fighting was incredible, I can’t wait to see it again for all the details I know I missed. I think in terms of choreography and camera work, these fights were hands down Marvels best work. 

I don’t quite agree with the gripes of the crazy CGI ending fight scene with the dragons. I understand wanting more of the intimate one on one fight with the rings and Shang and Xu, but I feel like there would’ve been just as many complaints if we didn’t get to see the big bad monster behind the wall either. Like come on, it’s marvel, it’s fantasy and adventure and I love how over the top they made it. Maybe they could’ve balanced it a bit more between the main two fights in the third act but I enjoyed it all so much I didn’t really care. 

Hoping the sister is not a good guy or a bad guy moving forward, would be a fun antihero to pop up in different movies. I audibly laughed from excitement when she strolled up on the dragon. 

Can’t wait to see it again, someone needs to talk to that airline about their vegetarian friendly options.",pgw0wk
hbf7xhc,"I really liked it. A bit predictable script wise as most of these origin movies  are but the way they used the rings, the creativity, choreography to the fights and the way they looked, was just top notch and took it to the next level.

It was just consistently fun to watch whenever there was any action on screen.",pgw0wk
hbg06d9,The entire movie was freaking amazing. I'd say the first 2/3 of the movie was when it was at its best then it really turns into a marvel movie at the end but it was still badass.

Then, they end up getting attacked by a person from their past, dragging them back into the swing of things.

I thought a lot of the special effects were surprisingly bad. There was also some pretty iffy green screen work at times.

I wasn't super impressed with a lot of the humor and exposition. I thought the supporting cast was good or great, especially the older actors but I think a lot of the humor and exposition that Awkwafina and Simu Liu had to deliver was lacking.

I’m almost positive the first photo was Bucky, but I couldn’t tell who the second was.  Maybe Sam? Did anyone else catch this?  I definitely need to keep a closer eye out when i go see this movie again.

hc6tgsj,"Overall, I liked the movie, but I have some questions concerning Shang-Chi's father (Xu Wenwu) and Ta Lo.

**Concerning Wenwu:**

•	Sending an army to retrieve the pendants from Shang-Chi and her sister makes sense, but his additional order to murder them doesn't, even if he found it impossible to happen. Why would he risk? More so when we come to understand the importance for him to reunite his family.

•	Why was his house left unguarded before his wife's murder? He has changed for her, but he wasn't so keen to change his residence. In fact, was he so delusional that there would be no consequences to bite his ass after four thousand years?

•	Instead of helping his son fighting the monster to redeem himself, why didn't he avoid letting himself die? Why didn't he use the ten rings to defend himself? At least Obi-Wan Kenobi had a duel with Darth Vader before puffing away in front of Luke's eyes.

**Concerning Ta Lo:**

•	We see that the forest for Ta Lo is a maze of moving trees, but there's a fixed point in which the portal resides, behind the waterfall. Why don't use a helicopter to reach it? Without needing to wait 3 days to reach it. It's not like the waterfall was swarmed by bamboo trees.

•	There was just **that small village** in Ta Lo to watch over the prison of those soul-sucking demons that almost swept away their universe? Wasn't there a high-tech city? It's not like if no one was aware that a 4000+ years old conqueror with powerful rings was coming in 3 days to tear it apart. The battle would have ended differently if it wasn't for Shang-Chi (who awakened the dragon?).

Side note:

•	I'll never believe that in 3 days a novice can shoot with such precision an arrow kilometres away from the target and **HIT IT**.",pgw0wk

Other than that, I loved it. I loved how much they included cultural aspects, from no shoes inside the house, talking about giving whiskey bottles to those passed away, the dragon, the tai chi, the huge pressure of the dad on his son while showing love simultaneaously.

hk7mzll,"Honestly, I just thought the writing for the most part was bad and contrived. I never really cared about any of the characters and by the mid way point I was realizing how underdeveloped most of them were. A lot of the humor also felt forced, especially Awkafina's character, who came off as little more than bad comic relief (which to be clear I don't think is Awkafina's fault personally since she is a good actress and gave a fantastic performance in The Farewell). A lot of the English language dialogue also felt overly hokey and inorganic, which I don't blame on the actors themselves, but the script.

It's a problem with a lot of blockbusters where I just feel like the whole thing rings hollow by the end. There's some nice effects, stunt work  and cinematography, but the story and the characters and the smaller details all just don't work for me. I walked into the movie with fairly high expectations going by the reviews/public reception, but just left feeling like the movie was perfectly mediocre. 

It's also generally a consistent MCU problem, but I really feel like a lot of the fight sequences would have benefited from more grit and noticeable changes in momentum from the impact of different strikes etc. A lot of the fights just felt too safe and saturated so there was no sense of danger in them.",pgw0wk

Without Trevor suddenly showing up in the most improbable location to provide key information the story would collapse.   Such an obvious in your face plot device.   The credit scene with Wong would have made a better ending, could have included the restaurant friends for singing bit.  The end they did choose just seemed stupid, not funny.      For the rest enjoyed the movie.    Oh, last nitpick.

Normally I can give a pass for the big CG comicbook final showdown, but I think the soul sucking dragons were a big misstep. They took away the agency of the Mandarin, would have preferred if he was misguided in his actions due to being an insane 1000 year old war lord. Instead he's being manipulated by demon dragons? 

They didn't really explore the Ten Rings organization that much nor the rings. Instead it's all getting saved for sequel bait? I also didn't care for his sister and it seemed that the movie forgot about her or just didn't know what to do with her after the second act.

I was hugely disappointed in the battles and lack of strategy.

When they're at your village, you have a ton of archers... Sitting there, and you do a melee rush against their own ranged attackers without using any of your archers. Why?

You know the one real risk to everything is the guy wearing the 10 rings, and instead of making him a focus you allow him to walk through? It seems like the aunt would have been the most likely to fight 10 rings man and beat him considering her sister did, but nah she just lets him go through

hbecukl,"The choreography was quite good from what I was expecting..a nice blend of martial arts with western angles and cuts. There was some obvious wire work on scenes with ""wind"" but that fits the Wuxia style so it works within the movie.

This film however is most definitely not an Asian American target audience...at best it is a Chinese American target audience. The culture, the mythos, the creatures all of that was heavily centered around Chinese culture which makes sense from a character and story perspective but not based on what was said and how it was marketed. 

There was however one scene in the movie that basically summed up every Asian American family which is the ""3 generations"". You have the 1st generation which is the Grandparents..they came over knowing 0 English and to the present probably dont speak English very well or heavily prefer to only converse in their native tongue. Next you have the 2nd generation which is the Parents..they are more Americanized (more English use and understanding of Western values) but because they were raised by the source they are 50/50 split. Then you have the 3rd generation which is the Children. They normally are quite detached from their culture as they were born raised and learned from the start Western culture and the culture anchor at home is not as strong due to the parents being Westernized as well. This generation normally speaks very little to 0 of the native language.

The other unfortunate thing is that this is just another typecast movie where the Asian protagonist uses/learns Martial Arts.",pgw0wk

I’m not some Marvel nerd and maybe wasn’t in the mood at the time because I had to go to work early today and needed sleep, but I just don’t think it would be much better if I was in a better mood anyway.

Good effort and Liunwas okay as the lead, but for my opinion i they needed a bit more characters to help the cast carry the film. Respect to Akwafina, but just don’t like her comedy too much. I think she is okay in smaller roles, but they should’ve had another friend with Liu who was just as funny. Like I said Liu seems like a decent actor but for my opinion he just doesn’t have that factor or see in other Marvel heroes.

hbydp29,"This movie was really bad about ""show don't tell"". So much of the exposition was done by dialogue. They may as well have just handed us a pamphlet to read in between each action sequence.

 - They meet with his Dad at his secret lair, and he goes on a 10 minute spiel about his character motivations *literally at a dinner table*.

 - Shang talks about how his first mission at 14 was a defining event in his life, but they never show what happened. They show a shot of his Dad giving him a knife - multiple times actually - but that's it. Shang just talks about the rest.

 - Even the things they do show, they make it redundant with dialogue. Like the mother's death. They talk about how she died and how it affected them. Then they actually show the mother dying. Then they talk about it some more.

 - The worst was the Big Bad Monster. We literally never see it until the final act. We aren't even aware of it until the third act in the magic village, where his Aunt gives them what amounts to a PowerPoint presentation. So then you're shown a Final Battle against a Big Bad Monster that you had no real reason to give a shit about for most of the movie.

hbiclgf,"It was ok. Just ok. Which I feel is pretty much how every Marvel movie will be from now on. There's no real heart or meticulous care anymore. Just pump out some new characters. The whole thing felt generic. So many tropes.

Also, between Black Widows, Winter Soldiers, Hydra, SHIELD, Flag Smashers, on and on... apparently every single person in the world is part of some sort of shadowy cabal able to topple regimes at a moment's notice. How... boring. The ten rings were much cooler, much more realistic, and much more frightening in Iron Man (also, why did they need Tony to build them a missile when they're backed by a 1000 year old empire with mystical energy weapons?). It's also becoming increasingly stupid that everyone knows about these secret dimensions, magic universes, ancient artifacts and yet SHIELD is surprised to see some aliens in the 90s. Sorry Thor, guess you're not that impressive anymore. No wonder you got fat.

The fight scenes were pretty good with some standout moments (Bucky would probably be pretty jealous of the knife fight in the scaffolding), but again, nothing groundbreaking. I feel like The Matrix had better martial arts fight and better CGI. The CGI over all was... mostly not good. The bus scene was the worst offender. Pretty much on the same level as Black Panther, which isn't a compliment.

The Mandarin was not a compelling villain. And, side note here: Trevor Slattery's return was an unwelcome surprise. The worst part of the 2nd worst MCU movie should have been a 10 second cameo at best (preferably a quick and unceremonious death scene); but of course we need to throw in some shitty jokes to take all the tension out of important scenes as is now the Marvel way. The henchmen were more threatening and more interesting than the Mandarin, who I guess decided to give up the ultimate power of a god to be... a stay at home Dad, or something. Until his wife dies and then naturally, fuck those kids they ain't shit.

The rings themselves were underwhelming, I haven't read the comics but as far as I understand they're sort of like minor Infinity Stones each with their own aspect. Naturally the MCU response is make them go pew pew generic energy blast.

The final fight was underwhelming, lacked any sort of serious depth. Some day maybe some movie director/writer will learn a ton of special effects and giant explosions aren't what make good fights (see Cap vs Bucky in TWS or Cap/Bucky vs Iron Man in Civil War). The generic dragon vs dragon fight was your typical fly at each other, boom shockwave shit that's been done 1000 times and why Superman fights are so goddamn boring. Naturally Shang-Chi immediately masters an ancient weapon, better than his father who's used it for 1000 years, and defeats the all-powerful beast from some horrific dark dimension (but don't worry, he'll have trouble beating some humans in the next movie, no doubt).

Tone was all over the place (mostly due to Marvel's inability to let movies take themselves seriously anymore), character development wasn't great, story was standard trope. Some of the 'homages' felt more like whatever the asian version of blaxpoitation is, but I'm not asian myself so maybe I'm wrong there. Simu Liu and Meng'er Zhang were good, Awkwafina was grating to the point of being annoying at times (but serviceable and thankfully not a love interest), and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai was pretty solid even though his character was generic.

All and all, it was fine, but I wish they'd go back to being something impressive. The more they try to expand into magic and multiverses, the more they lose me because the movies have nothing to ground them or relate to anymore.

Here's hoping for better in Spider-man (I'm not confident in Eternals).

Naturally, this will get downvoted to hell because you're only allowed to rave about Marvel movies, especially if they have a 'diverse cast'.  After all, everyone knows criticism is the enemy of creativity.

Also, extra bonus points for the FATWS-esque 'I do some pushups so you know I'm super strong' scene in the beginning.",pgw0wk

Boy how boring was it two see two Dragons just come out of nowhere and fight it out while the main leads just watch it out. 

I am seriously confused as to how people like this film? Some  are even comparing the action in the film to films like Raid and Raid 2. I get that the action is good. But its nowhere as good as those films.

hbkmdvf,"First and foremost, I was ready to make jokes about the guy with a machete for an arm being called Machete Arm. As it turns out, I was wrong, and he’s called Razorfist. If “What If?” doesn’t create a dynamic duo consisting of him and Taserface then it will be a huge misstep. Razortaserfistface could be a masterpiece.

Tangentially, the BMW sponsorship is heavy in this film. From the initial M8 that they take on a joyride to the discontinued i8 that BMW show their contempt for by having a bus run over it, it’s very blatant.

But by far the most incongruous, immersion breaking bit was our crew of good guys turned up to the mystical, luscious, otherworldly land of Ta-Lo. This mythical land seemingly brought to life from Chinese mythology, a village-farm from the past with all kinds of mythical creatures brought to life and walking around, made it stick out like a sore thumb when Shang Chi and friends rode in on … a BMW X5 with the words Razorfist emblazoned all over it. I found this sort of ridiculous and had to stifle laughter.

I also found the story itself to be a typically shallow affair , very reminiscent of the first Avengers movie with some great extra dimensional threat replete with flying monster swarm, nothing particularly of interest. Very much style over substance, nothing will surprise you plot wise and a few moments are telegraphed. Maybe that is because this feels aimed at a Chinese audience who haven’t been soaked in the tropes Western viewers have or maybe it’s just mediocre writing.

The two big bads of the movie - Shang Chi’s dad and the big dragon - were both unsatisfying villains in their own ways. Shang Chi’s dad villainous ways were presented through exposition but never really shown through his actions. He seemed like a decent enough guy, bit of a strict dad maybe but we never see him DO anything especially blameworthy that would warrant Shang Chi wanting to kill him.

And the dragon is unsatisfying as it gets about 10-15 minutes of screen time where it doesn’t really seem to be especially tough , puts up a mild fight and then pulls a Unicron when Shang Chi implants it with an exploding maguffin.

However , despite those shortcomings, on balance I enjoyed this movie. It feels different from other Marvel movies. like it is intended for an East Asian audience and
is better for it. From the epic score that breaks through on occasion which reminded me heavily of Final Fantasy themes of old, the floaty combat which brings films like Crouching Tiger to mind, the end battle which seems to have DBZ influences (the word kamehameha is directly used at one point), and mostly the combat which is often a tightly and well choreographed hand to hand affair as opposed to the superpower based affair of normal MCU movies. It was all refreshing and enjoyable to watch.

Visually it was also spectacular. It felt like it was filmed with IMAX in mind with some scenes really utilising the extra screen size to sell a sense of scale.

Some of the CGI was also very well done. To-La, especially, was breathtaking with its landscape and fantastical beasts and reminded me of how I felt watching Avatar for the first time. It’s a shame that IMAX 3D doesnt seem to be a thing anymore because this film would be perfect for it.

The movie had the typical MCU comedy in it too. Shang Chi's best friend started off playing comic relief and did well but the mantle was passed on to the Mandarin aka Ben Kingsley later in the movie who played it beautifully. He was laugh-out-loud funny nearly every time he spoke, and the absurdity of a scouser, with Liverpool FC scarf, with a headless, winged pet cat, just hanging around amongst mythical warriors, lions and dragons was certainly attention grabbing.

I definitely recommend this film.

This film definitely feels like it has a bigger budget than I anticipated, as if Disney are trying to increase their popularity in the Chinese market. If it’s successful then Shang Chi could be a big part of the MCU going forwards. And, as Captain America’s role in the show diminishes, a Chinese superhero takes a bigger role, perhaps some insight can be drawn on Disney’s own predictions as to where the money may lie in the future. Perhaps the stars are setting as the dragon rises.",pgw0wk

The good. Choreography was great. Fight scenes were great. Ring powers were fantastic. Some CGI was used very well. Humor landed most of the times, though I expected more clever quips from the main character. But guess he's not a funny guy, like Wong. 

The bad. 

1) Dialogue. Why was the dialogue (outside of the funny quips) written by a middle schooler? I'm not asking for Shakespeare level sonets, I just want memorable, meaningful dialogue. Instead of these random cliche pearls of wisdom (looking at you Michelle Yeo's horribly underutilized character). Look at Christopher Nolan. Apart from Tenet, he has created movies where I could recall every single sentence of dialogue. Because it's memorable. It's fantastic and clever, unlike this mundane heaping pile of doodoo script we got. Speaking of cliches, my god is this movie filled to the brim with them. I understand Disney uses simpler dialogue to appeal to China for the $$$$ (moreso than they already have in non-Chinese movies) but come on. ""You were meant for greatness"" ""family will always be with you"" *roll eyes into back of skull*.

2) Mother. Does this director/producer have an Oedipus complex? I'm seriously wondering. No joke, the amount of mother-related subject matter in this movie had me a bit concerned. Like there's a normal level and this just went so over the top it was worrying. Yes, we understood the whole mom-dead-means-a-lot the first 500 times it was brought up. I really didn't think the flashbacks to the mom character that we've barely even known meant anything, it's not meaningful to the audience.

3) Plot. Simple, basic, run of the mill. And don't give me that whole ""iT's a mArVel mOvie"" shit. They pour billions of dollars into these, and they've made movies with much better plots than this. Things which didn't make sense: dad being so stubbornly stupid about the demon behind the door, like you can clearly see the evil shit flying out, ""bb--b--b-b-bbbut ... your mother is calling to me"" ""no dad"" ""b-b--b-b-b-bbut son, your mother is-"" Fuck off, dad. Why did the dad try to kill his son and daughter just to get the pendants when he could've just asked and shown them????? Like, yeah just get rid of your 2 remaining loved ones, that makes sense. The dad character, though the actor is fantastic, honestly wasn't believable, or convincing enough to me. He'd flip-flop between evil menacing dude to nice, elderly father, but in a way that didn't make sense. One moment he tries to kill his kids for pendants, then he invites his kids to his place for a family dinner (which they're totally fine with), then throws them on the ground for slightly questioning him. ?????????????

And what even were the rings??? Why were the rings? How were the rings? What an incredibly unexplained plot device. Thor's hammer had a better story than the entirety of this movie. 

4) Runtime. Not as bad as my #1 most hated long-runtime movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. But still too long. Constant flashbacks to them being kids, over and over and over. Yeah, we got it. We understand.

5) Bad CGI. I hate entirely CGI animals. I said it. What a colossal waste of everybody's time. When the movie pauses for minutes at a time to marvel at 100% CGI animals grazing about, I get pissed. Like it adds NOTHING to the plot, the CGI is almost always awful on fantasy creatures (those tigers with fuckin perms in their hair), and it's just stupid because the audience KNOWS the actors are staring at literally empty space, amazed at nothing lmao. It doesn't have the same effect as when the creatures are not 100% CGI like Jurassic Park, where the realness factor doesn't disrupt your immersion.

hbl8cn6,"I'm a Chinese American that has spent half my life in America and Asia respectively.  I just watched this movie in Taiwan.

I'm not gonna lie, watching this movie felt super awkward at times and you could feel it in the theater.  I think it's because Asian American culture and actual Chinese culture have become so different and this movie is kind of stuck trying to merge Asian American culture, Chinese culture, and a generalized, mass-appeal Marvel culture into something that's unfortunately incoherent and very inconsistent.  

In hindsight, Black Panther also had that trifecta of converging elements but at least judging from the response to the film, the associated cultures all found something in the movie for them.  Then again, I don't know how actual Africans reacted to the movie.

Myself and many of my Asian / Asian American friends all found this movie to feel weird.  It felt foreign to the Chinese audience because they aren't familiar with Asian American culture.  But, to the Asian American side of me, it was strangely disrespectful in how it handled Chinese culture.  It felt severely lacking in cultural understanding and empathy and that's strange to me because I thought that was central to the entire framework of the movie.  It felt like things only went skin deep and came off as pandering.  Even the world itself felt weird in ways.  It's a heavily fictionalized, Marvel-version of a lot of appropriated Chinese historical / cultural iconography with none of the real associated substance or context.

I don't really know that much about African mythology, honestly, but I don't think anything similar to Wakanda exists in their mythology so Wakanda could just be Wakanda.  But, there are a lot of equivalents to Ta Lo in Chinese mythology.  Things like Phoenixes, Kirins, Dragons, bamboo forests, etc. all have meanings and significance.  You inevitably try to draw associations and comparisons but then Shang Chi never really acknowledges any larger cultural, mythological, or historical connection, it's just weird.  You want the movie to feel familiar or recognizable but it isn't.  Even the martial art style used by Fala Chen and Michelle Yeoh is some bastardized version of Tai Chi with Fala Chen throwing in some cliche shit about Yin and Yang later on.  It's almost like Marvel is trying to avoid a copyright issue or something.  

There is this theme that Simu Liu and Awkwafina are lost in ways within their society and background.  And, that in >!returning home or journeying to Ta Lo,!< they find a part of themselves.  But, at the end of the day, what they find or rediscover are not realistic Chinese roots, they're this shallow and empy fantasy. 

Honestly, it's a bit disappointing.

Because of the lack of overarching cultural significance, the movie just falls back to being a good but relatively generic family-focused origin story that has good action set pieces.  But, it's not a game-changer in any way.",pgw0wk

hbf2m4d,"Bottom three in the MCU for me (this, Thor, Iron Man 2), but I still kind of liked it as I haven’t flat out disliked  a movie in the franchise yet.

I really like the fighting. The bus sequence was incredible and I really enjoyed what I’m going to call the bigger Skyfall sequence. Knowing nothing about Shang-Chi, I kind of wish the actor was a little more charismatic. Might have been better going with someone a little more known as Awkwafina pretty much steals every scene she’s in and acts circles around him. Then the climactic battle begins and the movie just sort of fell off a cliff for me, despite having soul-sucking dragons.

It was okay. I hope to like it more when I see it again on Disney+ or Blu-ray.",pgw0wk
hbg91yk,"Man the third act was SO mediocre compared to the first two.

Just started to lose interest once they introduced the Dark Gate, the boring grey-ass environment where Shang/dad fought, and the avalanche of CGI mayhem with the dragons, it just became way less interesting and more generic. 

I really wish they would realise not every movie needs a giant-ass final battle, it's exhausting and boring a lot of the time - Black Widow had the exact same problem. Both movies would've benefited from a more intimate final fight.

It also had that Game of Thrones problem of horribly trying to composite human beings onto dragons and it just looks sloppy and awful.

7/10 movie overall but the first 90 mins or so had me expecting a stronger finish.

Trevor Slattery was also in this way more than I expected lmfao",pgw0wk
hblsu7b,"A bit mixed on this one. 

The first act is enjoyable. Its jokes land, its action is enjoyable and well-choreographed although a bit too choppy in editing at times, and the stakes feel palpable. 

The second act comes around. Exposition and a bit of characterization starts to happen. Okay, not so bad. 

But then the third act comes around & in classic MCU fashion, it’s too formulaic, too over-the-top with CGI (although impressive), false promises (I mean, Shang-Chi is driven to kill his father & then cannot go through with it, expressing some grief when said father does die by other means?), and features a deus ex machina from a secondary if not tertiary character that was the comic relief of the entire film.

Add to this opposing forces having to team up to take down the “main threat” and I cannot help but roll my eyes. 

It’s disappointing, that third act, but alas, such is the MCU formula, I suppose.",pgw0wk

hbym37i,"I just got back from seeing Akwafina: The Ten Rings.  Here's my review:  

The best:  absolutely Tony Leung.  What an incredible actor.  He really brought his A game even if the subject matter wasn't all that serious.  

The Good:  Ben Kingsley and the sister.  I have no clue what Kingsleys role was but he brought the only laughter throughout the film.  I really like the actress who played the sister.  She was very good.

The bad:  WAY too much Akwafina.  I have no idea why she was so prominent in the film.  She was in every scene and probably had way more lines than Simu and Tony, possibly combined.  I didn't laugh at a single joke she made and found myself wanting to tell her to STFU.  

Also the storyline and dialogue outside of the Tony Leung scenes were possibly written by a high schooler.  The movie could have been much tighter.  There were so many scenes where I went ""WTF?""

I'm giving it 5.8/10. I wouldn't watch it again even if it was on Netflix.",pgw0wk

I also feel like they could’ve given more character to Shang Chi; coming out of the theater all I can really say is he’s a good dude who really knows his martial arts.

Biggest thing for me was, all the mcu movies, I walk away feeling awe about the size, grandness, epicness of the movie, this didnt have that for me at all.

hbjnkxm,"It was a fun movie but I was disappointed that Shang-Chi was played so, so straight. All the other marvel leads have big personalities that they wear on their sleeves. Tony Stark is so smarmy. Thor has all that bravado. T'Challa has all the charming royal mannerisms without seeming smug. Star Lord has no attention span, etc.

It makes it super fun when these strong character designs meet and interact with each other. You can drop any character like this into any scene and it immediately becomes more fun with them in the mix.

But Shaun seemed like a secondary character in his own movie. Katy has a big personality. Shaun's dad has a big personality. But Shaun is just kind of like ""Hello. I'm here and this is all happening around me.""

If you had to do an impression of any marvel character, I feel like it would be really easy. Every lead, from Peter, to Natasha, to Strange, to even secondary characters like Valkyrie and Wong, all have immediately recognizable character traits.

If I was forced to do a Shang-Chi impression... I have no idea how I'd do that. Aside from the whole ""My father is so disappointed in my low paying job that he's literally trying to kill me"" thing, what's Shawn's angle? ""Token asian?"" Seems like a blown opportunity.

If I was Marvel, I'd want to bring back Tony Chui-Wai as a villain real bad. I'd maybe want to bring back Katy as comic relief in small doses. But I don't know what the hell I'd do with Shang-Chi outside of another Shang-Chi movie where his character is retooled.",pgw0wk

hbmhko5,"Crazy thought: What if Shang Chi killed Katy's dad?

This is probably a reach but just indulge me for a sec. We saw her family in the beginning and it was just Katy, her mom, her brother, and her grandma. They call the grand ma ""Wai Po"" which means Katy's mom's mom and not her dad's mom (would be refered to as ""Nai Nai""). This is speculation and just one senerio running through my mind of where this conspiracy might work out but this might mean that her dad's side somehow got separated from her. Usually the grandma that lives with the family in asian cultures is the Nai Nai so why would they be with her Wai Po instead? Maybe the dad was a bad guy (i.e. crime boss) and the mom wanted to separate her family from that dangerous lifestyle so she took everyone and fled to America. Hense why Katy is able to lead a pretty apple pie life. This could explain why Wenwu finally found him after several years in America instead of Macau cause Mr. Crime Lord decided to chase after his family. 

We also don't see what causes Shang-Chi's teenage devotion to his dad to crumble. So what if crime boss is able to find and build a good relationship with his daughter over the course of a few years and after un-aliving his mom's murderer, he sees Katy crying over her dad like how he did over his mom all those years ago. 

Maybe he decides to follow her to school later to scope out how the family of his mother's killer behaves and gets caught by the big kid they mention in the begining at the bar. After being ""saved"" from this bully (cause he could have just neutralized him) by the crazy girl screaming song lyrics and having his cover being blown, he realizes that martial arts is not the only way of life and he remembers how much fun he used to have. Thus Shaun is born. 

Definitely needs polishing but this is just my conspiracy brain going off so feel free to accept or reject my theory and maybe add your spins on it.",pgw0wk
hbmr4wx,"The main character was just so uninteresting. He's not really the driving force for the story, the father is.

Compared to say Black Panther where although I think T'Challa wasn't that engaging either as a character, at least it felt like the story was centred around him and the choices he makes.",pgw0wk
hc24jlm,Thought the movie was pretty solid. In fact I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of the movie. Then in the final act the movie took this weird out of left field turn and made it into a generic CGI fight. The monsters locked up behind the wall being protected seemed a little shoehorned in. I think I would have preferred it if the ending stayed closer in tone to the rest of the film. Still entertaining though. Also a little let down by the power of the rings. They are some of the cooler weapons in Marvel imo and was really excited to see how they would use them. Instead we just got a generic weapon. Hopefully in the next one Shang-Chi can discover their full potential. Overall I think I enjoyed it more than the average Marvel movie. Characters were enjoyable and it easily has the best fight scenes in the MCU.,pgw0wk

Other than that the movie was good. It's not the best Marvel movie but it's not a bad movie either. Definitely expanded the lore of MCU in a good way and makes me look forward to the next phase.",pgw0wk
hbgl3al,"Some positives:

Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh killed it. 

I'm very glad that they let the choreography breathe. Compared to Black Widow or Snake Eyes earlier this year - this is how hand-to-hand combat should be shot. 

The family aspect gave it the emotional depth it needed to weave in and out. 

The negative:

My biggest complaint, besides some of the humor being very predictable, is the CG. Some things looked great (Tao Lo looked solid all throughout), but the compositing in a lot of scenes looked worse than a 2000s movie. When they're walking along the wall that Michele Yeoh is using to tell the story of the soul eater, some of the exterior shots of the bus that were not practical, and worse of all the whole ""set"" of the showdown between him and his dad. Sometimes the rings would cast a light, other times they wouldn't really. All of the dust and smoke around him looked super fake. I don't get how one of the biggest studios right now still has CG like this, when other times it's perfect and projects like the Star Wars sequel trilogy show how we can basically do anything now with a combo of practical and VFX.",pgw0wk

hbil1wu,"I was pleasantly surprised seeing this, as I think the trailers kind of did a so-so job. Random thoughts:

The bus fight is going to end up in the canon of great move fight scenes, and the fight with the parents was a great as the clearest wuxia-like moment, as well as doing so much in a short time to establish the romance and start humanizing Wenwu. Both of these make up for what I felt was the underwhelming 'orange cgi vs blue cgi' final fight with his dad. That comparison kind of encapsulates the film's occasional tonal issues of Marvel vs. Inspiration style clashes, but I suppose there is no way around that in this kind of a movie. So they did about as well as they could with still creating a Disney/Marvel product.

That CGI knock aside, I was amazed the full on Chinese fantasy creature menagerie actually worked. 

In terms of the performances, it does suffer slightly for how ridiculously Tony Leung outshines everyone else. Obviously he's a legend (as are Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh, albeit in much smaller roles), but there's a risk to that kind of casting, and in a lot of ways it felt more like his movie than Shang Chi/Simu Liu's. Sympathetic villains are always important, and really, they took this an extra step with Wenwu, as even in the end his 'evil' was the result of an external manipulation. So often I felt like I was more interested in him. The family angle they developed with Xialing also kind of reinforced this: the two were good together, but you felt like you wanted to see all 3 of them on the same side at some point, and never really got that.

Wong was fun, and including the false Mandarin was a great decision. Comedy in these films is always a matter of where its appropriate or not, but focusing it into a singular character like that helps a lot.",pgw0wk

i think it's because its basically a western wuxia movie, it feels like there's a lot of chinese involvement, like the CGI has that chinese mega-production style to it.  i also noted there was not a single black person in this movie so marvel goin for ultra bucks when it opens in China

ive read some here say it doesn't have the 3rd Act problems most marvel movies do,  but i still find its the same schlock.  as soon as you see villagers donning color-coordinated armor and melee weapons, you know what's up.  then the fucking Ten Rings shows up with laser-bola-crossbows (?) instead of something like M60 machine guns and its pure marvel cheese from there.  its a shame because everything was solid before that,  like when wenwu goes to the gangsters hideout dudes pulled guns on him, and you sort of forget for a while you're watching a MCU property",pgw0wk

I don't really keep up with the Marvel universe personally or watch trailers so a friend asked to watch this awhile back and I went in completely blind. Cue me being absolutely stunned to discover that Tony Leung was in it, I absolutely love the man and grew up watching a lot of his films (HK Golden Age or whatnot). He was the highlight of the movie, and reading through a lot of the discussion in this thread already, I'm glad that many also share a similar sentiment. Most of all, I'm excited that the West can finally experience his amazing talent and the writing/acting really brought out a side of him I don't think any of his other films have.

Tony Leung rarely ever plays villains, which was already a treat. But what I was extremely surprised to find was how he was still able to deliver such a great performance in two non-native languages. The biggest 'wow' for me was his undubbed Mandarin as he generally has a person that dubs for him in all his other Chinese films. While you can hear his Cantonese accent in the dialogue, I absolutely loved it and how much freedom the director gave him in crafting Wenwu and portraying the character. Also, his English is amazing. For a second, I thought someone had dubbed him over, then I realised that was not the case and his light English accent was just...wow.

hbu35ev,"I feel like I’m in the minority of people who feel luke warm towards this movie. None of the humor landed in my theater at all. I think there were laughs once maybe twice. I really hated the vegetarian or beef joke. Why can’t Marvel let serious conversations or events take place without immediately cutting it with a laugh? 

The sister felt like she didn’t even need to be there. She never got to resolve anything with her father or confront him. The post credits scene of her deciding to take over the ten rings organization was disappointing. Why do women characters have to take on traits or roles that were formally held by objectively bad men to be powerful? 

The third act would’ve been a lot better if it had stayed a smaller intra-family conflict as opposed to the CGI heavy fantasy fight we got. The ten rings is in the title for I feel like they were underutilized. Shang-Chi felt like he was secondary at times in his own movie and it felt like a lot happened around him or to him but he didn’t really make many impactful decisions. 

All that being said, the first and second act were good. This is definitely one of the better origin movies and those in general tend to rank pretty low for me out of what the MCU has to offer. The fight choreography was very engaging. The bus fight scene might be one of my favorite fights in the MCU. I loved seeing Michelle Yeoh even though I wish she had a bigger role to play.

The whole movie was just such basic cliche after basic cliche. When Shangchi had to choose between saving his sister and interrupting the dragon, it was like predicting water is wet that they'd fucking make Katy be the one that shoots an arrow from an impossible distance away to save the day.

The insane amount of ""cut to character's face for way too long to acknowledge to the audience that they know what they just did"" cuts were actually embarrassing. It happened 500 times, but one example is when his sister saves Katy from the bamboo scaffolding and it had to cut to both of their faces looking at each other and nodding so we know they now are 'ok'. It's so embarrassingly amateur it's pathetic.

This movie was more disappointing to me than I could've predicted.

The humor never hit once for me except surprisingly Ben Kingsley's reprisal. Even though I think Iron Man 3 was awful due to how they utilized him. Other than him no other actors have any form of comedic timing.

The exception was the Ten Rings - it looked cool and the way it was implemented into the fights was also nicely done. Instead of the giant soulsucker/dragon fight I would have preferred more martial arts. Maybe I'm biased because I grew up on those kinds of movies. One of the better MCU movies imo. Feels like they are all kind of in the same ballpark for quality nowadays. Missed the first few minutes getting snacks but oh well.",pgw0wk
hbr8bea,"I was overall disappointed.

You can't have a breakdown about killing someone 10 years ago when you kicked about a dozen people off the side of a building 4 days ago. 

Giant soul sucking God of outer planes gets taken out by a single arrow from hundreds of yards away (let just say it flew because of dragon materials) shot by someone who couldn't handle arrows alone 3 days ago""

So... 1 woman from this village can take out the 10 rings with ease, but the entire village can't take out guys with stun rods and electro crossbolos (why not guns I have no idea)

HOW LONG WAS THAT ROPE

Fight scenes were cool. 10 ring mechanics were bad ass. Cameos at the end felt underwhelming.

Weird how the sanctum had no prior curiosity to an immortal man with a powerful relic who has been flaunting it for literally 1000 years.",pgw0wk
hby6px9,"The good:

* The first half is almost non-stop action and it's fucking awesome. Definitely the best action and fights in the MCU. A ton of fun.

* the movie looks great minus some shoddy CGI here and there. The villlage was gorgeous, the first dragon too.

* soundtrack is great

* interesting villain, although by the end I was getting a bit tired of him basically just being completely delusional 

* solid acting all around

* good balance of humour. I am usually not a fan of Marvel humour but outside of a few jokes I didn't mind it here.

The not good:

* pacing was off. First half is one fight scene after another, then comes a huge pause where not much happens except a shit ton of exposition and then we go straight to climax

* speaking of which, the ending fell off the rails and once they reached the village the story became complete non-sense. Out of the blue a completely new villain is introduced and gets an elaborate backstory that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie.

* Katy saving the day was weird. Like I'd be fine if she did it using her driving skills but instead she magically learns how to shoot a bow in like a day or so. It seemed like they realized she has absolutely nothing to do once they reach the village so they gave her this.

* Shang Chi himself was a bit... unrefined I feel. He was basically just ""my dad this, my mom that"", but never felt like a complete character of his own. Katy did a lot of heavy lifting keeping their scenes interesting. His sister was completely underutilized too.

* The soul suckers felt completely unnecessary. I'd be fine if the climax was Ten Rings vs Villagers, instead they rope in a fucking kaiju to fight at the very end. One dragon was fine, the other just turned the finale into a CG clusterfuck, as usual for Marvel. I would've liked a much better resolution to the conflict between Shang and his dad instead.

* the rings needed atleast some explanation - why did they switch sides exactly? Are they like Mjolnir or something? They felt a bit random to me.

Overall

Almost all the action scenes were totally badass and definitely above average for MCU but in other aspects this is just another Marvel movie. Probably one of the better ones but it has its issues. The biggest one here being the final act. 

But I'm just glad I got to see something in cinema after like a year. If I ever watch it again I think I'll probably just skip to the fights.",pgw0wk

I was BLOWN away. It was so cool seeing Simu do combat. I wish we got to see more of that. The scenes that were reminiscent of wu xia films were great too. I could really tell that Marvel was gunning for the Chinese market because I genuinely could see the appeal. 

There were so many small details, especially in the first act of the film, that paid attention to and felt authentic to the asian american experience. The shot of Shang removing his shoes before entering, the scene of him drinking zhou, the grandmother who gives presents to her husband in the afterlife, the nagging about getting married…. Plus, karaoke!

hbem1cb,"The bus fight was lit. And the bamboo fight along side the skyscraper reminded me of rush hour 2. The kajiu fight at the end, although appreciated, was unnecessary. I enjoyed the fantasy part of it  but I came for the fights, you know? Also I ended up thinking the mandarin was kinda of foolish in the end. Leaving his family unprotected a huge hindsight on his part and because refusing to stop breaking the gate. Like bro, you don’t see those soul eaters flying out of there and your still doubting your son. At least he went out in a good way. 

Movie was better than Captain Marvel IMO. That’s my lowest MCU movie and definitely miles better than snake eyes for another comparison. That’s for sure.

Lastly, I am kinda of upset thought about one thing. Marvel baited us hard with the abomination. He was in & out of the movie in like under a minute. That was bullshit. You can’t tell me the trailers didn’t led us to believe they were gonna fight each other. Now I really think Marvel did get scare about how the movie will do and decided to show that to draw more interest.",pgw0wk

Shang-Chi ‘s mom get beaten to death without a single bruise is simply too cartoonish, I am sure a few bruises won’t break the PG-13 rating. 

My favourite scene is the awkward family dinner scene with Wenwu. Not hating Simu Liu but Tony Leung’s performance is way above everyone else in the main cast.

Shang Chi is a kids movie that has Awkwafina talk about her vagina for no reason. Just a dumb way to talk about her moms disappointment and an unnecessary way to add in some adult humor. 

The battle at the end is dumb. Bad guys should have guns, or the good guys should use their arrows. 

The REAL bad guys come out and they are just your cgi army. Of fucking course. 

Everybody seems to teleport places. The compound needed to be helicoptered in but then they were able to drive from their to the magical hidden village? Or when the Iron Gang just walks up to it? I guess so. 

Some of the cgi looked real bad. Sometimes the rings were cgi and I thought that was silly and obvious. 

This movie is a lot of fun. The silly parts arent silly enough to ruin it. But it is way to long for over 2 hours. Especially when we pretty much know how it is going to end.",pgw0wk

Great action choreography, honestly the main reason to watch this movie. I thought the fight choreography and camera work with the action is the best. I've never really been a big fan of wuxia, so that stuff kind of fell flat to me, but I did enjoy the CGI clusterfuck that was the Dragon fight. 

Tony Leung's Wenwu was definitely the best character, and he sells it pretty well. Simu Liu was honestly pretty good. I don't feel like he had a lot to work with in terms of dialogue, but he was solid in his performance. Personally I find Awkwafina somewhat obnoxious in most of her appearances, but I thought she was fine here for what it's worth. The sister felt kind of wasted, I don't know what is was, she was present for most of the movie, but she lacked any sort of charisma or anything really. I really wanted her to be a better character, but I'm not sure if it was just poor acting, poor script or both, but she felt really wasted.

Honestly, by the end, I enjoyed it, but I definitely felt it was kind of a weird movie. Was really surprised how much of the dialogue was in Mandarin, I'm curious to know how Chinese audiences will react and who will be dubbed over.

But it makes me wonder for Shang-Chi's future.  I'm assuming at least a trilogy, perhaps Avengers movies - I'd like him in a TV show personally.  So there has to be angst somewhere along the line.

hka10hy,"This embodied everything I hate about Marvel movies. First off, I don't get the praise on representation or moving past the racism from the original comics. It still very much embodies the exotic orientalism tropes as well as the noble savage trope. Once they got to the other land it was just a grab bag of whatever ancient Chinese imagery is familiar to the West. This still feels like the same shit we could have seen in the 80s or 90s. I don't get how this is supposed to be less racist. 

The characters were paper thin. I knew the writing was bad when a character had to literally explain they knew the other for at least ten years. Just shitty writing. Wenwu was supposed to be this 4000 year old man that was so powerful and controlled a secret organization but never actually ran the world or anything for whatever reason. 

The whole father/son drama was underwritten and even if they did a better job it would have shit the bed in the end like with Black Panther where they just have a stupid CGI explosion fight because a Marvel movie can't deal with actual heavy issues. 

The fight scenes were inspired by much better martial arts movies, and even though said martial arts movies were also well choreographed they still found the way to make the action feel real and impactful. Hits meant something, you felt them. Shang-Chi just puts a CGI gloss over everything it comes across as sterile. It's like with Black Widow, these were supposed to be just human characters good at fighting. But you would think they are superhumans with how many hits they land or take and even their enemies keep taking hits. 

Am I asking for excessive blood and guts? No. But what you want to see from a fight scene is the participants feeling the consequences of their actions. Getting exhausted, sweating, getting bruised. Maybe a few cuts or some blood. When you can have a prolonged fight scene and the characters look exactly the same as how they started, it's just bad. It doesn't engage me",pgw0wk
hl5l1r1,"I don't know why people amazed from this movie. Even if we ignore the nonsense like village being protected by living forest and nobody ever tried to just fly over it, the entire plot is nothing but a one massive cliche, without a single memorable twist or event.

hbes4xf,"I really hope Katy and Shang-Chi arent in a relationship. I think it would be huge to normalize males and females just being friends.

Speaking of Katy I really liked her arc. The old dude calling showing her respect at the end totally used the ""insulting master who actually believes in you"" trope but it worked.

This is easily one of the better MCU movies. I want to see it again because I enjoyed it, not because of its greater MCU value.

At the same time it goes back and makes things like Iron Man 3 so much better. 

Tony Leung and Xu Wenwu easily hit the top of the MCU villains charts. I was really worried he was going to show up as completely twi faced and lying. But no he seriously believed in his mission and I think people can really relate to it.

I could have used less Xu Xialing. I dont know she wasnt bad but it felt like she really didn't add much. Most of the growth for other characters were just not based around her. Except the ""I won't leave you again"" that really almost completely fucked the entire world. If the world depends on dropping my ass to my death, DROP ME.

Razor Fist really got on my nerves at first. it felt like he was a token white guy. We need a white guy so we can say we have a white guy. And then I realized that was kind of the point. I am white as fuck so that feeling ended up helping me get it.

I think my biggest issue was significantly less CGI dragons and significantly more Shang-Chi vs Xu Wenwu. After he took some of the rings I would have loved to see the fight keep going with rings switching sides. Shang-Chi absorbs an attack and takes 2 but then Xu Wenwu absorbs 1 back and so on.",pgw0wk

hbew6ox,"I thought it did a great job at introducing Shang-Chi and the fantastical elements that were super fun to me at least, if not totally original. 

And for an origin movie it really moves in the first act to get to some action set pieces even if that means a lot of flashbacks later on. But I thoroughly enjoyed the flashbacks and family drama bits. Especially with Tony Leung driving the story. Everyone else gave pretty good performances I thought though. The standout scene for Simu Liu and Awkwafina being the confession that Shang-Chi killed his mother's killer and Katy emphasizing it wasn't his fault

As for the action scenes I thought they were really well done. They let the action move without to many cuts (at least compared to most mainstream movies) and tried to tell a story with the differing styles of Shang-Chi's parents. I do think some scenes are a bit too dark and the third act is CG heavy. But the scale was done well enough to make it novel.

Totally redeemed the other failed martial arts films by Hollywood this year with Mortal Kombat and Snake Eyes. Hate the rapid cut scene and extreme close ups.

Tony Leung like everyone has mentioned. He brought so much gravitas to the role that Wen Wu is one of the best villains the MCU has. I am sad if he is truly dead. He's a master class actor that you can tell just by looking at his eyes in each scene he's in. The guy isn't massively built and is only 5'7'', but damn can he be imposing just by looking at him. If the film wasn't PG-13, I could see Wen Wu violently killing off his wife's attackers given the ring's powers.

Simu Liu's down-to-earth performance as Shang-Chi is appreciated. Kind of gives him an ""awe-shucks"" to him despite being an assassin trained from birth. I feel like Marvel was careful not to have him quip too much despite the fact that Simu seems like a funny guy in real life.

Li is somewhat disappointing because I feel like she wasn't given much to do in the movie other than feeling like she's living in her brother's shadow and hints of being power hungry. Why didn't she join in on the talk with Shang-Chi when he walked about killing his father?

Also like how the story tackles the Asian American theme of meeting a parent's expectation versus the kids finding their own path.

hblyao1,"Loved this movie. Was much more invested in it then I'd thought. 

The fight scenes were some of the best in all of Marvel. They should follow this film's lead for all Marvel films going forward with hand to hand combat. The amount of Mandarin and native languages spoken was fucking awesome.

Simu Liu was excellent, Awkwafina was quite enjoyable, and the twosome of Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh were amazing. 

My only downsides were that Tony Leung died (probably hard to get him for more then one film tbh), and that it became a big monster fight at the end. I don't think they *needed* that bit, but the post credit stuff showed why they did. 

Overall, really really great. Can't wait to see where Shang-Chi shows up next.",pgw0wk
hbmdks7,I thought deathdealer would have a bigger role. But they made him such a throwaway character. Razor fist had a bigger arc.,pgw0wk
hbmeqas,"I enjoyed it but to me Shang Chi felt a little bit unfocused. I wish the relationship between Shang Chi and his father, the core of the story, was given more development rather than just montages. I think one very strong, traumatic flashback that implied regular abuse would have been more personal and relatable. Perhaps a more expressive lead actor would have helped. In a movie with parental abuse/familial love and the struggle within the Asian diaspora as its core themes the Disney comedy undercut moments have compromised the tone of the story more so than other Disney films, and making Awkwafina's Katie do all the comedy relief for the first 2 acts makes her character less likeable. I also was quite disappointed with how Shang Chi's character was written. His arc screams self insert and is done in a very basic way, which I guess is to be expected from Disney. Tony Leung's performance was excellent as expected. The way his genuine love and kindness flips so quickly to unbridled wrath reminds me very much of my own father. The decision to make his motivation a mostly righteous one was also effective.",pgw0wk

hbrggy0,"Having come from the last review thread with a bit of skepticism at the reviews, I found the movie generally really good and to be honest I liked it better than Black Panther (which the flavor of the reviews caused the comparison to be frequently brought up).

The Mandarin/father villain seemed super well written and acting and was a refreshing and actually compelling villain when so many of these Marvel villains of the week are interchangeable and disposable, which is why personally I was disappointed when he essentially gets replaced by 'Big Scary Arbitrary Amorphous Bat Dragon Soul Sucker"" which is essentially isn't even really evil so much as it's just an animal that does things that people don't like (is a tiger evil if it eats a person?). the best Marvel origin movies are the ones where the villain is at least as compelling as the protagonist and this movie had that until suddenly it didn't. This opened up some other issues for me with the story such as how the person who's been shooting arrows for like 30 mins is suddenly really good, him not wanting to kill but throwing ninjas off a building left and right, or more importantly the classic 'we have another world ending event but of course no other Avengers are going to be here'. The stakes in my opinion went too high so as to demonstrate Shang Chi's powers but the story would have been serviced better at focusing on just the father and son dynamic or at least setting up a better villain behind the door (I had thought maybe it was something Dormamu or Mephisto related but to be fair I'm not super versed in Shang Chi lore). 

Overall, I liked the movie quite a lot and some of the martial arts fights were super super cool and it will be awesome to see the style paired against some of the other MCU fighters. I'd give it a 7.5/10 with the biggest con being the 'villain that exists to be killed off' at the very end, although with the Eternals trailers that I've been seeing where it looks like the villains are ALL nonsense monsters I'm sure I'll appreciate this movie more so actually 8/10.",pgw0wk

Katy was unnecessary and completely took away from Xu's character and much needed screentime. Shang-chi had no real heart to heart with his sister for the whole movie and told Katy he was going to kill his father instead of his sister. They also indirectly said Katy was going to be an Avenger in the end with her standing alongside Shang-chi and that felt completely unearned.

They should have elaborated more on Shang-chi's abuse and why he decided to leave. They showed him train really hard for the approval of his father but when he got assigned his first assignment he just dipped.

Another motherFUCKING army fight for the third act. At first I thought it would be good because it was between martial artists but then the fucking dementors came in and it was the same shit we've seen so many times before. Why the hell wasn't Xu fighting her dad alongside Shang-chi? Showing him what she was able to do even though he cast her aside?

In the moment I hated the dragon stuff because I wanted a hand to hand fight as the finale, but I'm more lukewarm on it now. It was fine and I like the Kamehameha reference.

I think they went overboard with the cgi. The ten rings and how they work should’ve been explained more. Some scenes needed more dialogue, ie. when Shang all of a sudden was able to control the rings, or when Shang’s father got his soul sucked they literally didn’t say anything to each other. The “real” villain being just a bunch of monsters with no depth. Also random dragon coming out of nowhere because plot armor, not sure if that was ever explained.

Not trying to hate on the film, I am also asian and appreciate that we have an asian superhero. Beautiful visuals, amazing fight scenes and great cast.

hkns8vl,">!I found it a bit weird that Katy got dragged along everywhere, she was a fun character, but she was a nobody, at least from their father's perspective. I though it would have been much safer for her to just stay in the building after the fighting ring raid, since they didn't want anything from her and was just a civilian. Also, why did they try to murder her on the scaffolds? Like I said she didn't have anything they wanted. And Xialing leaving them in the office almost caused Katy's death, she saved her in the end but a second later and her and Shang-Chi's relationship would have been irreparably damaged.

Shang-Chi confessing that he is a killer to Katy also felt a bit weird, since she's seen him kill quite a few 10rings assassins(?) since the start of the movie(throwing people of the scaffold of a skyscraper throwing someone under the wheels of a speeding bike), yeah they were in self-defense as opposed to a premeditated assassination, but it wasn't just a random guy he assassinated in cold-blood but his mom's killer, so I say he gets a pass for that too.

Also I don't get why he blames his dad for his mom's death, yeah it was his past that came back to bite him in the ass, but he was trying to leave that life behind on his mother's insistence and it quite clearly broke the man, to the point of neglecting his children and believing a world-ending soul-sucking abomination just to get his wife back, so I was sympathizing with the him, not wanting him to die.

Other than these small issues though, it was a really fun movie and the final fight scene with the dragon and the dweller was really fucking epic, which I haven't felt in a marvel movie in a long while. I don't know why but chinese martial artist settings(like wuxia and xianxia) really do it for me, so I hope there will be more big-budget movies like this.!<",pgw0wk

hbq63lf,"As much as I enjoyed seeing Shang-Chi at the theater-- amazing fight choreography, fun creature design and charismatic AF leads-- my biggest problem was Tony Leung's character. Not taking away from his masterful performance, but the movie begins telling us he was power-hungry and dedicated his immortality to the pursuit of power. Then, it's all building him up as a father overcome with grief, which didn't quite gel for me. 

I understand the idea that meeting his wife put him on a different path, and that this sets up the conflict in the third act (not wanting to give much away), but at the same time, I think the movie would've been stronger with a conflict between Shang-Chi, his neglected sister, and an immortal, self-motivated father with immense power. I wasn't totally onboard with an ancient leader of a powerful shadow org. made up of international assassins-- who trained his son to be a killer from an early early age and expected his daughter to be furniture, to be seen not heard-- being made into a tragic character. At 1,000+ years old, he was awfully naive, and imo the movie trying so very hard to make him sympathetic reduced the crisis Shang-Chi faces in confronting and possibly having to kill his father. 

This movie felt like two or three heartbeats from being a badass, hard-R martial arts thriller, so much so that I couldn't help wanting to see this as that movie and not a Marvel movie that predictably devolves from and INSANE first act (that subway scene is better than anything that follows, have to say) to a predictably CGI-driven clusterfuck in the last. Though, compared to other Marvel movies, at least the CGI character/creature designs were better than usual. 

The trailer for The Eternals bored and underwhelmed me immensely. I can't fathom why they thought that'd bring audiences out. Even without COVID I'd regard Eternals as a very risky gambit. All this said, Shang-Chi is fun even for a tired-of-superhero movies dude such as myself.

For example, according to the culture, the iron gang was suppose to challenge the father, if the father is not alive, then the son. Not the daughter or the mother. The martial art is only a superficial move of tai chi. There’s really no martial art at all. I felt like no even a Chinese references in the film and in the end it is more like Japanese culture in whitewashed fashion.
Only the father and mother, their appearances are good and performance worthy, only to be ruined by plot.
No emotion, no superhero feel and terrible plot. I would trash this movie and rate as 40 out of 100. Only CGI is good.

The core plot was pretty bland to me and no amount of cool world-building/mythology could spare me from a pretty intense amount of exposition regardless. I thought the 3rd act was a murky, portal-in-the-sky mess that threw away nearly everything that worked about the first two acts. I only cared about Shang-Chi vs. the Mandarin in the climax. The sister also became strangely underwritten.

Comedy was very hit or miss for me, as usual. Definitely an above-average Marvel flick but the 3rd act (along with pacing lulls in the 2nd) really brought my enthusiasm down for a movie I was LOVING for the first 45 minutes or so.

EDIT: An 8.3 average from r/movies?! Wow, didn't see that coming. MAYBE I'll check it out again if my opinion is that off the mark (audience was terrible as well in the theater) but I can't say I'm incredibly stoked to see it again. Maybe once it's streaming?",pgw0wk
hbx3mwr,"For the first half of the movie, it looked like they were on their way to make a great ""Marvel does Kung-Fu"" movie. They had the perfect setup: Solid cast, martial arts, street gangs, cage fighting, secret badass ninja army, ""Outcast son vs Evil but redeemable father"" dynamic. And it actually had some genuinely good fight scenes for a Marvel movie.

But then in the second half, they abandoned the theme of the first half and shoe-horned in another cookie-cutter ""Big Bad Monster"" that was underdeveloped and artificial. (You literally don't even see it until the final act.) If you told me that that part of the story was hijacked by the studio, I wouldn't be surprised. It honestly felt like a different movie.

So it went from ""a great Marvel movie"" to just ""an inoffensive Marvel movie"". I'd still recommend it as something to see on weekend with friends, and I'm not surprised it's doing well in the box office. But it made me a little sad - it had the potential to be so much better.",pgw0wk
hbf5ee9,"I was impressed that the first sequence of the movie was entirely spoken in Chinese. And that a good portion of the movie (40-50%?), was spoken in Chinese. Watching that first sequence, I was thinking that it was incredibly ambitious for Disney/Marvel to start a movie by only using only Chinese for a franchise entrenched in American/English-speaking audiences. Had this movie came out a few years earlier, all the lines would be in English, with only bits and pieces of Chinese sprinkled in to evoke foreign mysticism at key moments.

I was also impressed by the fluency of the Chinese. All the Chinese was spoken with very natural and native tongues, using natural dialogue (not English machine translated into Chinese), and it didn't seem like anyone was forced to speak Chinese that didn't know it. And strangely enough, the same could be said for the English. No distractedly overt accents from any of the actors speaking in either language. Code switching is all but natural for the 1.5 generation, and just as you wouldn't expect a gringo accent in a Spanish speaking film, it's refreshing to see a Chinese American movie where it isn't cringe to hear Chinese being spoken.",pgw0wk
hbhwhv4,"This movie was top 10 marvel for me.  The fight scenes alone were best in MCU 

Only Winter Solider comes close


Seeing Slattery again was fun. I so want a Morris plush. 


The finishing move on the Soul Sucker was fantastic. 

That mid credit scene


My only complaint is Awkwafina.  I am just not a fan of her, don’t know why.  And now she is in the MCU for a while it seems. 

Other than that. Great movie",pgw0wk
hk3wt21,"Worst movie of the MCU so far. Shang was a great character but the plot was mediocre.


First, he was never in danger. You know his father would never kill him.

Second, how was he convinced to kill his father (!) so fast?? His drive wasn't developed enough to justify Shang-Chi hating his father so much he could actually kill him. You never believe him when he says 'Ill kill my father"". No you won't you're not that bad.

4/10 just because there were some cool fight scenes.",pgw0wk
hkdj9w6,"Shockingly bad. Bad CGI. Bad acting, which is not their fault. They get Tony Leung and don't seem to care to use him. First 40 minutes was entertaining enough, but every thing after that is so boring and illogical, and sloppy storytelling. If you told me this was the series finale of a CW superhero show I would thought it was OK, but its not. Zero emotional pay off even though there is plenty of room for it if they would only take their time telling the story properly.

How far Marvel has fallen where films like this gets a positive score, feels like im taking craszy pills seeing people liking it.",pgw0wk
hbemxl1,The only bad thing about this movie is that it guarantees that an Iron Fist movie will never happen.,pgw0wk
hbqt5te,"Just got back. Marvel proved me wrong. The 'every line of dialog has to be quippy' schtick  is gone. Awkwafina is actually capable of not being annoying. Who knew?

This is my first movie since the pandemic started and I wanted to support an Asian superhero, and I am very pleased with Simu's fighting and acting skills. I want to see him play a bigger role in an ensemble in the next movies. Don't turn him into another Wong, please.

Got to see more Tony Leung than I thought I would, but I still wanted more. Goddamn he's a presence on the screen.

Him fight/dancing with his future wife was cheesy, but in a good way. 

That third act was where things started to feel like the old movies again. Maybe there's no other way to approach it?

If Phase 4 can maintain this level of writing, comedy and action then they might just stop themselves from going off the rails.

And importantly, my woke-O-meter did not go off at all. Kept expecting the sister to be the rightful wielder of the ten rings. Didn't happen. 

And in the end, she got to run her army with *half* of the force being ladies. Not all of them. This, is how you make a progressive movie.",pgw0wk
hbefbrv,"Good movie. I agree with the RT critic average of 7.5/10, and will agree with everyone who says this is one of the best \*origin\* MCU films we've had. It does a good job introducing a new little pocket of this world already full of magic and advanced tech, and because we're already so primed to the fantasy elements, seeing ""old-fashioned"" chi/mysticism stuff barely phased me. At no point did I really care about how the rings worked technically, how his mom could airbend, etc. since we've seen far crazier already. The one moment that went too far was Katy's archery - did she turn into Hawkeye after a day of training? That was weird. Maybe they could've done something to explain her skills, either with mysticism or some backstory (i.e. she studied archery in the past).

Speaking of Katy, not only did Awkwafina have great chemistry with Simu, the movie really needed someone to complement his more reserved personality. I know the comical sidekick is cliche, but historically, a lot of action movies have suffered from heroes who have little charisma. This is why movies like Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights work so well, pairing up the soft-spoken physical badass with a more light-hearted partner (who gets their own badass moment in the end). Not all of her lines worked, but overall I liked this character way more than I thought I would. I think they were hinting at romance by the end, and I'd be okay with that.

The fight scenes were of course, the highlight of the movie, but I think the best stuff might've all been in the first act. Seeing ""Sean"" fighting those guys on the bus was the closest we got to hardcore martial arts action a la The Raid. The CGI fights in the end were certainly well-done, but any time you introduce stuff like that you know the main characters' plot armor will protect them. That said this was definitely a better final battle than Black Panther, which relied on fully-CGI human bodies fighting. This used CGI for the stuff that actually needed it, but not for Simu and Tony, which would've been horrific since both their faces would be visible. I don't know how much of their action was computer-assisted, just saying, this isn't Blade 2 rubber humans hopping around.

If I had one key complaint, I think they could've made Wenwu more of a villain. I know people love their sympathetic villains, but they could've given him more of an overall ideology/plan beyond ""I want my wife back"". This guy's been around for 1000 years, why is he just now falling in love. I guess he was just waiting for someone who was hot as shit, but could also do airbending and stuff. Not sure how to make the character better, and I'm not saying he was a bad antagonist, but it does feel like he could've been better.

Overall I highly recommend this if you like martial arts movies, especially if you like the wire-fu type stuff from Crouching Tiger. Though they don't go that far with it, characters move in ways that \*mostly\* make sense.",pgw0wk
hbhzb99,"Likely unpopular opinion, as a mid age Asian dude that live in NA, it is a fun movie and all the cast(except Simu and Yeoh) are great.  Simu, he just doesn't stand out IMHO and over shadow by others.  Yeoh have been doing the same character the last 30yrs, it is getting old just like Bruce Willis.

As someone that watch tons of movies east and west the originality was lacking alot, I can almost point out where they got the idea from at any given point.

As a non comics fan I give 6.5, maybe 7.",pgw0wk

hbp1nx2,Did r/movies start calling this movie overrated yet ?,pgw0wk
hbfye6g,"I had an awesome time with my wife and actually brought my dad to watch it too. I think my only criticism is that I wish they hadn’t backloaded a lot of the development and compelling emotional subplots in the second half of the movie. It really reduced the first half of the movie to the fun set pieces and cool fight scene part of the movie, with little in the way of giving us much reason to care until closer to the end of the film. I really felt like between Shang-Chi, Katy, and Xialing, there weren’t a lot of characters in the first half that were very compelling and all of them act mostly passively with questionable drive and motives… Between Katy just deciding to hop on a plan to Macau in the beginning, and all 3 just deciding to get in Wenwu’s helicopter after the Macau fight, there were a lot of things that made all the characters feel like they were being ferried from location to location without clear motivations.

When Simu was actually given some time to act though, man, I was impressed, even having been watching Kim’s Convenience for years. They needed to give him more to work with in the first half rather than just fight and be shirtless.

I think that they should have showed the scene with Wenwu destroying the mahjong/poker club earlier in the movie, since I don’t think we had a lot of reason to be frightened of him prior to that since the movie was primarily explaining what he could do/what the Ten Rings were capable of. Apart from his power, that was the first display of his cold-bloodedness, and would have served to be placed earlier in the movie so we would have more reason to be afraid/feel more of Shang-Chi’s fear/respect for his father.

I did see some people say they liked the pacing of the flashbacks and such… I think unfortunately they might have gone a little overboard, even though all the flashbacks had essential development in them. They had a tendency to break up the pace of the movie, especially when there was one point where a flashback occurred in the middle of the cage match between Shang-Chi and his sister and just cuts back to her kicking him. 

Overall, it was great and honestly pretty moving. Tony Leung definitely brought the most subtlety to a Marvel character I’ve seen… maybe ever. A lot of people mentioning his fantastic ability to use expression and silence to act, and completely forget his first language isn’t even English. What an incredible performance. Not sure if he did his own fight choreo at his age, but the fights between him and Shang-Chi, especially at the end, were probably my favorite. Despite having an ending that had a ton of CGI, I felt Marvel successfully avoided the big CGI monster/monsters pitfall and made the big soul eater seem like an appropriate ‘big bad’ while giving Wenwu an appropriate end/redemption. Love that a new generation gets introduced to some wuxia, the same way Crouching Tiger did decades ago for the west. Will probably go watch it again with my brother.",pgw0wk
hbg1hor,"If I were to have one flaw, it would be that act two slumps a little bit. Acts one and three are basically back-to-back action sequences, so it feels a little jarring when act two slows things down. I wish there was a bit more distribution of “catch my breath” moments.

Other than that, I really don’t have any complaints. Excellent screenplay, unique direction, great acting (especially from Simu, Awkwafina, and Tony Leung), bar-setting fight choreography, beautiful scenic design, wonderful effects, and very well-paced and non-intrusive humor. Shang-Chi is everything I was hoping Marvel would accomplish with Phase 4: something that you can tell is part of the MCU but still feels distinct. I absolutely loved it.

Also, >!Trevor Slattery!< stole every scene he was in. I was crying laughing at the >!fake death on the battlefield.!<",pgw0wk
hbg66ni,"I was mixed on this, wanted to love it, was super hyped for it.  The first act set-up was strong, felt like could be a Batman type of character.  Middle act got bogged down in exposition.  Final act and the fight scene were just all over the place, dragons and soul suckers, and Shang-Chi and sis flying on the dragons and some crazy stuff.  Also, his Mom singlehandedly defended Tao Lo from his father with her fighting, how did a whole town of these magical ppl so poorly defend the gate from this army?  The dad just walked up to it and just had to fight his undermatched son.  

It was great to see an asian led MCU movie, but my main issues are with the story and script.  There wasn’t enough conflict (nor love) between Shang-Chi and his father for their story to resonate, and the father’s sacrifice death at the end didn’t really mean much.  I was confused at the father’s storyline because he had become a good person when he met the mom.  She died because of his evil past.  So he then said he’d do whatever it takes to get her back when he hears her voice.  So this makes Shang-Chi say he is going to kill him.  Before that he was just a ruthless father who trained him extremely hard to be a supreme fighter/assassin.  Is that worthy of him saying “i’ll kill him.”  He could just stop him, right?  Clearly he is under some dark influence with the voices he’s hearing.  The father’s story was more about the tragic loss of the wife (due to his past) and he had a hard time with that, so Shang-Chi could have tried to save him from himself.  They tried to dance the line and show the father as a complex character, not full evil but not all good either (probably closer to good, in the end), but I think the movie would have been more effective if he was more of a typical evil bad guy.  They didn’t pull off his story arc, nor his complex relationship with his son.",pgw0wk
hbh1h4m,"

Definitely the best action in any MCU film, it looks so great now that marvel have stopped over-editing them with constant cuts. As a spectacle this is one of the MCU's best efforts, really gorgeous scenery and cinematography towards the second half that's worth seeing on the big screen. I did feel like this film could've used some better characterisation though, definitely a bit too much exposition and over-explaining during the middle portion. The final action sequence also lost a lot of what I loved about the action earlier on.

Overall I still really appreciate how this film raised the bar for the MCU in terms of filmmaking, so it's a good one in my books.",pgw0wk

Amazing fight choreography (best since winter soldier, possiby better) and cinematography and all around amazing visual effects/CGI. Lots of great acting too, especially tony leung",pgw0wk
hbhvs4g,"Yeah yeah the fights were cool and all, but what about that soundtrack? I thought it was really cool.

Tony Leung (The real Mandarin, right?) was fucking sick, sad to see him go. Glad the character got an appropriate sort of ""redemption"" at the end, definitely one of the better villains we've seen.

For a bit, I thought the mother talking to Tony Leung might have been real, because of the part at Katy's house where the grandma would leave food for her husband. I thought they were setting up some sort of afterlife scenario there.

I loved the dorky duo that is Shaun and Katy. That little lesson Katy learned about having no actual goals was done in a nice, simple way with the bow allegory.

Curious to see what Xialing does with the new Ten Rings group and what future relevance it will have to the MCU. Hopefully it doesn't just fade into obscurity.

Also, so how strong is Shang-Chi compared to other heroes in the MCU right now, now that he has the ten rings himself?

One thing that seems sad, now that I think about it, is that with the rings, Shaun's immortal now. So if he chooses to keep them for a long time, he'll stay the same while Katy grows old, eventually dying.",pgw0wk

Of course it has some little problems here and there, but I was thoroughly entertained.

hbjms71,"The action was great. It started out like a Jackie Chan/Jet Li film. Then it moved to Avatar: The Last Airbender. And it ended up becoming Dragon Ball Z with a bit of Kaiju battle.

If Netflix was smart, they'd immediately hire this director and production team to make their Avatar: The Last Airbender show. They literally had air and water bending in the movie. And the way the rings were used is similar to earth/metal bending.

I do think they had one major misstep, the soul sucker. I think the soul sucker should have had some kind of personality. If it's capable of deception and could project hallucinations of Wenwu's wife, then it should be an intelligent being. I was disappointed that it was just a big monster.

Also, this is a nitpick, but I don't think they should have said that Ta-Lo was in a different dimension or universe. Those are more modern sci-fi concepts rather than older mythical ideas. I think they should have said something like ""realm"" or ""plane"" or ""sphere.""",pgw0wk

hbjnpke,"I have to put this out into the void (saw it a few hours ago): I fucking loved this film. I was literally tearing up at how beautiful some of the scenes were, that they let shots linger during the action, how the characters fought like it was a tribute to old Chinese martial arts movies. 

And I know CGI monster sequences doesn't make for the greatest storytelling but I really didn't mind - it was just so epic and fantastical. It's true that the soul suckers came out of nowhere and were unexplained, but I still thought it was cool. I loved how it all came together in a kaiju battle and every main character had a part to play. Yes, I was totally hype when Simu Liu came down to wreck that CGI beast (which imo had a cool, almost Lovecraftian design).

And every single moment Tony Leung was on the screen I was riveted. As well as his fighting and usage of the Ten Rings. Damn!!!! Yeah, there could have been a bigger focus between father and son in their final showdown but I was pretty satisfied.

You have this super bright and colorful world, but the final battle was just shades of grey and brown CGI happening on the screen. The 3D glasses didn't help either. Especially the dragon battle was a mess, I had no idea what was going on at some points.

I also think it would have been better if they kept it more as a grounded, human conflict. The soul eater stuff wasn't necessary and came out of nowhere, the family drama plot itself was strong enough with Leung selling it effortlessly. They could have just focused on the theme of power and grief corrupting a person and it would have worked too.",pgw0wk
hbkx390,"I’ll post what I said on Letterboxd, there are a couple of spoilers below.

I enjoyed it quite a bit overall. I thought the fights were great, much better than I expected although there is a disappointing lack of fights in the second half overall. Most of the humour didn’t land super well for me, although I did enjoy Ben Kingsley and Morris. As expected, Tony Leung is the highlight and although everyone does a solid job here Leung acts circles around pretty much everyone

However this film does continue the trend of the MCU casting excellent actors to play villains and either a) do nothing with them (Mads Mikkelsen) or b) kill them off after one movie (Tony Leung, Kurt Russell). I get they may not want to commit to multiple films but shutting the door completely is infuriating especially when they’re the highlight of the film.",pgw0wk
hbp1kgv,"Really enjoyed that!! I was surprised by the pacing and never felt bored or like I was getting spoon fed exposition for a character I knew zero about. I thought the movie was going to fall apart when they re-introduced ""The Mandarin"" and the chicken-pig, but they leaned into it and the world got more fantastic in a good way. Wenwu was one of the most developed villains that Marvel has shown in the MCU, imo. Not a typical ""I gotta take over the world cause I'm really mad at the Avengers"". He had already ruled his world in some way shape or form for the past 1000 years. Enough to his liking anyway. He was driven by obsession and that all important questions ""what if..?"" I really enjoyed the time spent on Wenwu and Shang-Chi together. I'm interested to see where the Ten Rings go under Xailing. Maybe something Capt. America and company have to deal with? 

The fights were really well choreographed. Obviously lots of CGI involved to show off the power of the rings and the elemental fighting, but it didn't feel like people were pulling punches or standing around. LOVED the way they incorporated the rings into the fight when Shang-Chi took control of the initial five. I'm glad we didn't have to go through some obvious soul searching ""test"" for him to earn the rings. 

When they got to Ta Lo I was a bit wide-eyed, but all in. The lions and the water dragon looked AMAZING!!! Really nice bit of world building done by Ying Nan.

All in all it was just a lot of fun. I appreciate more and more that the MCU can work on so many levels. It can be from Daredevil beating up mobsters all the way to the TVA, soul-sucking demons, and literal planets impregnating earth women. 


A little aside about my theater experience these days...

hbrcbo5,"What I Liked:

 - The Mandarin was awesome and completely stole the show. The actor's performance was great. Major redemption after that shit-show in Iron Man 3.

- The action scenes were exciting and engaging.

- Shang-Chi and Katy were likeable main characters and the actors genially had chemistry with each other.

- Shang-Chi's backstory was well-done and fleshed out both him and The Mandarin well.

- The sister was cool and has a lot of future potential.

- The designs of the creatures were unique and interesting (especially Trevor's creature and the dragons). 

- The comedy played better than usual

Didn't Like:

- Trevor and The Abomination were distracting and didn't belong this movie. I appreciate the MCU model of connecting everything together but I think we're at a point where it actually detracts from the story. I love Ben Kingsley but Trevor felt like he was from another movie. (because...well....he is)

- The Abomination should NOT have been hyped up in the trailer. This is a character that has been missing for 13 years and he's brought back for half a minute to fix a fight with Wong ?! What in the actual fuck?!

And then Shang Chi just pulls that shit out of his ass so conveniently when he fights his father? He just happens to pull out his mother's fighting style after one sparring session with his aunt, and his father says nothing about it?   
  
To be fair the movie is already 2 hours long and there simply isn't enough time to develop everyone's character correctly. But its like her character should have meant so much more. No actual heart to heart with Shang Chi about what they had both been through, hardly anything from her on their father, and that scene where she brings up her mother which gives us some foreshadowing of some kind of development there, but we get nothing! Its a shame that they made this character who should be as interesting as Shang Chi because this whole movie is about Shang Chi's conflict with his dad, when its partially her conflict too as his sibling. Like she even mentions she's just pushed aside by her dad, and then the writers do it too lol.

hbf1068,Liked the movie hated his sidekick her voice just killed me the whole movie only other gripe is I didn't like the way they did the actual 10 rings the actual rings in comics each have a power of their own they bestow upon the user and could've been more visually appealing than the infinity gauntlet.  Last complaint marvel really should stop killing villains off I feel that there was meat left on that figurative bone with the mandarin dead who's Shang gonna fight now?  Also was that a fing fang foom reference when they mentioned a signal?,pgw0wk
hbfubhe,Ta Lo got ninetales from Pokemon. RIP Audi and MCU relationship.,pgw0wk
hbhgx2g,"I came out of the theatre after this movie, with the same satisfaction I did when I watched Guardians of the Galaxy the first time I saw it. I wasn't too sure what to expect, wasn't sure if I would enjoy the story, and if I would enjoy the characters. 

Blew my expectations away. 

Loved the fight scenes, all of the them. I enjoyed the humor sprinkled throughout. When I go see comic book movies, this is what I want to see. It was very apparent everyone in the movie put a lot of love in this movie. 

I'd happily see this movie again.",pgw0wk
hbjmw46,"The movie was 10/10 rings for me up until the last 1/3 where it became as  a CGI clusterf***. 

It would have been better if they ditched the Dragon fight and had a personal one-on-one with Shang-Chi and The Mandarin. A pure Kung-fu fight after Shang ditches the rings. Then Shang convinces him that his mum is truly dead then he allows himself to get soul-sucked. 

And in my wildest dreams they would include a concept where if you get souls sucked you see you worst nightmare so they can have a way to include that Iron Man fight we deserved from Iron man 3.

The Mandarin might be the best acted villain in the MCU, Tony Leung kills it.

Actions scenes were the best the MCU has had. 

Loved it overall. 

4 stars",pgw0wk
hbmim0n,Awkwafina was my favorite part of the movie! She reminds me so much of myself!,pgw0wk
hbn5q89,"I’m thinking low A tier, not top tier with Endgame/IW/Cap2 but up there just behind Spiderman, Black Panther, and Thor 3. The fight choreography was straight up breath-taking, the 10 rings are amazing to watch in action, Ta Lo beasts were very cool, and the villain was nothing great but solid. Music was also good for MCU standards. 

My main gripe was that the first half of the movie felt extremely directionless and everything felt slightly tacked together in the last act. 

Great movie though, reminded me a lot of Black Panther. I fucking love the contrast between the two fighting styles of the mom and dad and the way the 10 rings reflect that. Was so fun to watch",pgw0wk
hbnmi79,"I normally don’t like Awkwafina but her humor felt appropriate in this so I didn’t mind her, she was cool. This reminds me of Black Panther — I think of the two as sister-movies. The leading roles were POCs, the humor was similar, the sonic(?) waves emitting from T’Challa pounding his fists together and from the Rings, the soundtrack, etc.

Shang-Chi himself didn’t really impress me up until the very end. Before that, Xialing outshone him. And I gotta say, as an avid fan of Dragon Ball, I **LOVED** the reference at the end. After the movie finished, I saw an article that my brother shared about it on social media and I was so grateful that I didn’t see it beforehand lol

I’m definitely gonna rewatch it when it comes out on Disney Plus, which is a big thing to say since the only MCU movies I’ve ever rewatched all by myself are Black Panther, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Infinity War.",pgw0wk
hbts7x6,"One problem with this movie is that I can't really tell you what Shang Chi's personality is. I think with a well developed character you should be able to place them in different situations and already know how they'll act. The movie has so much plot and action that it doesn't give you enough character.

How would you describe his personality?",pgw0wk

hk2ez62,"This film had overwhelmingly positive reviews so i had high hopes. It started out fine but turned into a shitfest by the end. This is not some asian hate rant. I'm asian myself and am perfectly fine with the mystical elements and kung fu but wtf is that ending? The villiain could imitate voices of people it had never met before and communicate telepathically with ease from anywhere in the world? Seems promising. I was expecting a humanoid evil spirit who lived thousands of years or something but nope. Its another cgi bat looking monster that eats souls so it having telepathy seems implausible. The baddest gang in the world uses.. Taser weapons? Dafuq. And of course there is a dragon. As if this film isn't asian enough. They should have kept it small, r-18 fights with family loss and acceptance being the focus with the mystery of the rings front and center. Marvel always gotta go big, full of spectacles and jokes. Except spiderman ffh, phase 4 has been a dud so far and eternals sounds like it sucks even more than shang chi. DC is hitting back hard and marvel has no answer.",pgw0wk
hkdxd79,Holy shit this movie is seriously bad. Ngl some scenes are impressive af but the movie overall very disappointing.,pgw0wk
hkj9xhp,"This movie was essentially split into thirds. The first third was pretty good, great choreography and fights, nice character introductions. 2nd one started getting cgi dependent and it felt super unnecessary and was mainly flashbacks and character developing that felt like weird pacing. The third one turned complete cliche full blown cgi and basic villain that turns good before he dies. 

It basically became a Disney version of Godzilla and it felt like it was a complete different movie from the beginning. Unfortunately I didn’t give a shit who lived or died by that part. The pacing also worsened through the final third. Overall it was extremely disappointing and I’d give it a 3.5/10.

Edit: typo",pgw0wk
hkjrkau,"I don't know how people can even compare Shang-Chi (which imo is just another Marvel movie) with Eternal. I love when the reviews say that in Eternals there never seemed to be a real enemy. Like what? How do you compare that to a dragon/soul sucker that exploded due to some random alien technology? But didn't the same dragon/soul sucker exterminate a superior civilization? Wow. I mean they even complained about CGI in Eternals. Really? Like every freakin scene in this movie smelled CGI. Like even the whole bus scene.

So basically we are reduced to people loving meaningless and extremely pointless action scenes with random dudes for three-quarters of the movie, but hating Eternals where every single fight was meaningful?

Let's talk about my man lord 10 rings. His character just didn't fit with a guy who is supposedly 1000 years old. His temper, his demeanor is just not very well suited. I don't care whether even the comics had the same crappy portrayal or not.

Moving on to the sister character. OMG. Like for someone who waited years and years for a brother who never came, they reunited way too quickly. It didn't fit her. Her whole character development was shabby.

Lastly, our boy, Shang-Chi the sunshine. How is this dude not rusty after 10 years of supposedly 0 training? It's incredible. And I love how he learned a new martial art in just a few hours. Lovely. New rings? Never used them? No problem. It turns out he is a natural.

I don't even want to talk about the extremely weak plot. Like this village has been waiting there with a handful of men to do what? Funny.

I watched it today on Disney+. After all the hype and comparisons done with Eternals, I am extremely disappointed. Bad CGI, shabby plot, and random character back-story and development.",pgw0wk
hbg0kpt,"I liked the film. The action is very fluid (unlike most of the marvel movies where it’s just constant jump cuts) , the actors did a phenomenal job especially Tony Leung.

She's not the title character yet she's always there and has like half the lines. If they wanted Awkwafina that badly they should have picked a female superhero instead of Shang Chi.,pgw0wk

I guess I’m wondering, where’s Ta Lao’s Iron Weapon?

Also, The Ten Rings waltz Into Ta Lao with crossbows shooting electric bolos.  Since they’re already going against the spirit of a martial arts fight, why not just bring some guns?

I like martial arts movies and Marvel movies so I’m not complaining, but I was scratching my head a bit",pgw0wk
hbedrxw,"So when did this movie take place?

The date given was “Present Day”—2021 or 2023?

Shang-Chi’s parents met in 1996. Shang-Chi was seven when his mother died. He trained for seven years, then he lives in America for ten. That would put it at least in 2021 (assuming he wasn’t snapped).

At the end we see Bruce and Carol. Carol has long hair like before it was cut as seen in Endgame. Bruce isn’t Smart Hulk. So that leads to it being 2021. But Bruce’s arm was in a sling like from using the gauntlet. So 2023?",pgw0wk
hbelb3r,"Thank god they got the martial arts fight scenes right in a martial arts movie. The bus and the tower building action scenes definitely the stand out of the film.

And awkwafenia let the village elders just die, like I thought she would take the shot and save him. Also I felt that the father's death was anticlimactic. 

I really like the fight scenes, they felt competent and easy to follow. Good CGI for the most part as well. 

Disney/Marvel back at it again not knowing how to keep good tone. Why is there an airplane food joke when Shang is talking about his mother's death? 

Aqua isn't as bad as I thought she would be, and her vagina joke could be a reference to her parody rap career nearly 10 years ago.

Like just watching two giant CGI dragons fight felt so random and off to me. Why was that the final *final* battle and not with the actual villains of the movie?

At the very worst they should have explained the origins of the rings and how the gang was formed, instead the titular object/gang was relegated to the sidelines of their own movie and it focused on a out of the left field hidden society of protectors. The villain's true face was not seen until the very last minutes of the movie and it got killed immediately so nobody cared about the final act because we had just met the players and we don't even have any idea what their powers are.

Also that hero has no hair style at all. And what horrible acting. Horrible script. Nonsensical back stories. Boring and irrelevant childhood flashbacks. And what can I say about he fight choreography?

The writing and performance in the first few interactions between Shang Chi and Katy were pretty bad and almost felt like an SNL skit.

HOWEVER

As soon as they got to Katy’s house for breakfast it got really good and stayed that way the entire way through! I was so pleasantly surprised with the rest of it after the beginning and can honestly say it was one of my fav MCU movies. The chemistry between SC and Katy was night and day after the beginning, the fight choreography was insanely good, the humor almost always landed. The relationship between the siblings was great and I loved how it was set up well entrenched into the MCU yet still felt like it was still in it’s own slice of that space and made it it’s own. It fell into the trope of martial arts movies & fight scenes on scaffolds but it was executed flawlessly. I also really enjoyed how there was basically a kaiju fight at the end. In the grander scheme of the MCU I think they set the bar really high for Shang Chi as far as power level with his rings. After watching that, you can’t tell me he wouldn’t have bodied iron man, spiderman and a lot of other heroes. As a standalone movie it was fantastic so I’ll leave it at that.

Definitely an 8/10 and it’s funny bc I wasn’t super excited for it after the trailers but I’m really happy it was made now that I’ve watched it. I definitely want to see more of Shang Chi and honestly I’ll likely give it a 2nd watch again. Other than the first 10 minutes, they absolutely killed it!",pgw0wk

The only humor I liked of the movie came from the fake mandarin. Everything else just felt underwhelming. Some examples I can think of was when Shang chi's friend shot the arrow at the soul beasts throat, or when she sang California when the ninja attacked her outside the building, and so on. 

All in all, the movie was amazing, but I felt the jokes held it back in some aspect. But that is only my opinion of course.",pgw0wk

Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen were all great.

I have an irrational hatred for Awkwafina, but I thought she has some funny moments.

Ben Kingsley was hilarious. He's got some great comedic timing. Didn't know that the little munchkin thing was real 😂😂.

Then the stuff about Planet of the Apes, haha.",pgw0wk

The father was a much more compelling character and had a lot of screen time cuz of that. They also gave a little too much time to awkwafina and the sister.

It's just... a superlative action movie that has nothing to do with the rest of the MCU. It has a very light touch. In other words, it's fun and it's action packed.

If you go looking for the rest of the MCU to see, then go see Ant Man and Wasp, Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World, The Avengers, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy, and of course the original Captain America.",pgw0wk

I also felt like Morris was sort of a deus ex machina. And the fact that the dad put them into the same prison that the sister had previously escaped from. That whole sequence just felt very convenient and it kind of took me out of the movie a bit.

hc0pzc7,"For some reason I assumed thought we would have the predictable twist that that one masked ninja was going to be their mom in secret. So glad that wasn’t the case. 

Overall, I enjoyed the beginning of the movie more than the latter parts though. I find myself more into the sci fi than fantasy in marvel and I kinda wish that the finale was just a fight with his dad and not something with a Godzilla and Dragon, but maybe because I have no exposure to the character in the comics that wouldn’t be the case. I basically started to check out once we got into Ta Lo. But it was miles better than Black Widow.

I guess maybe the more I think about it the more I think that the movie would have been so much better to me if it had 15 or 20 minutes cut from it, because I did think the fight scenes early on were absolutely fantastic, I thought the 10 rings fight toward the end was awesome, and the dragon stuff was just way less exciting comparatively.",pgw0wk

Simu got surprisingly little face time with him being the main character. razerfist had no reason to be in the movie, nor the masked assassin. the bus fight was great, but wish they did more of it throughout. loved Tony Leung and the sister was great as well.  overall the movie was lacking intensity. there wasn't even music during the bus fight.

e: watched it again in dolby. sooo much better. idk what's going on with amc non-dolby screenings being super dim. still almost fell asleep when they were preparing in Ta Lo. there actually was some music in the bus fight, but it was sort of a slow rhythmic hip hop beat. idk why they wouldn't ramp it up, but it plays along with the low vibe of the rest of the movie. maybe they were trying to represent the duality of the character, but i think he would've been better served if the music was intense in one aspect and then intense in another aspect later on. my biggest gripe now is having a battle between 2 cg creatures to conclude the conflict. feels like a total chinese movie move.",pgw0wk

My god, the first 1/3 of the movie was basically rendered confusing and pointless with 1 line, and it only got worse from there.

There were no references to any of the featured characters disappearing for five years or losing anyone during that time. I even thought Katy’s grandpa’s seat being saved at the beginning (because he’s dead) could have alternatively been because he was snapped. 

The timeline of the parents meeting in 1996, Shang Chi leaving at 14, and the dad giving him ten years to figure himself out also would have worked.

Really loved what they did with the abilities of the 10 rings and how Shang used them so differently than his father. I think they can really expand on how he uses them in the future, and how he will be able to match up against more super powered characters. Choreography was great, loved the music. I even liked Awkwafina and I am a resident hater. Looking forward to see Kathy and Shang in more films together.

>!Bruce Banner!<, master of the stealth pun

Okay. I LIKED this movie. Saw *Black Widow*, liked it too, but overall it lacked that certain element to the story that I need to truly get engaged. I just have a crush on two of the actors in the film, and loved the performances overall, theirs included haha. Anyway, on to *The Ten Rings*

Plot: 8/10

I hope the plot of the Phase 4 movies have the same feel as this one. The storyline was self-contained. It was crisp. Flowed well. And I didn't really feel as if anything felt particularly forced. The most I felt was when >!Shang's dad showed up after sending assassins to kill him and his sister. *That* was the most jarring transition in the movie for me!< Which is why the plot isn't scored higher for me. Other than that the motivations and stories of the characters felt real >!Especially loved that the antagonist wasn't, for lack of a better term, a comic-book villain, but instead had very human motivations anyone could relate to!< And am *especially* glad a >!romantic subplot!< wasn't forced down our throats with this one.

Choreography: 9/10

Not a 10/10 because it didn't blow me out of the water, but I think frame-for-frame this was some of the best action we've seen since *Winter Soldier* in the MCU. The martial arts scenes were, to my non-expert eyes at least, gorgeous. And they did an amazing job mixing the comic-book elements of the story with the martial-arts. Without rubbing salt in the wounds of my fellow fans, this is the treatment many of us wanted from the *A:TLA* film. Favorite scene in the movie for me is >!the fight scene on the side of the building, right before Shang-Chi's dad shows up. Fed my shriveled, action-movie loving soul!<

Graphics/Effects: 7/10 (pending as I watched it in Standard instead of 3-D)

As referenced above, this is a movie made for 3-D, and I imagine it would probably have looked much better if I'd dropped the money for the tickets. But, not knowing how much I'd like the movie before hand, I decided to be cheap LOL. So a lot of the CGI effects, especially when it came to the >!fantastical creatures and beasties!< did pull me out of the movie for a bit. But. As mentioned above, it's likely I'll have a different impression on a subsequent 3-D viewing.

Performances: 9/10

Only not a 10/10 because I'd literally have to leave the theater crying to give that, or have come into the movie with *Endgame* levels of hype beforehand. That said, the acting was believable, enjoyable, and you can definitely tell all the main characters read their assignments. I didn't feel any were flat, or unenjoyable, or that they didn't stay true to their motivations. >!Shang-Chi's dad was my favorite character in the movie, because his actions are, to me, the most relatable out of all the mains. I hope the upcoming MCU films continue doing their overall good job of crafting enjoyable antagonists or villains!<

Overall: 8.5/10

Once again, I liked it. This movie, coming after *Endgame*, could very easily have been overshadowed by it and the fallout from that story. Instead, it was given space to breathe, develop its own characters and add an enjoyable new dimension to the MCU overall. I came in to the movie knowing nothing about the comic-book character. I was just hoping 1) that it would be a solid Marvel movie and 2) not to see naked cultural appropriation. The movie delivered on the first and, as far as I could tell from my non-Chinese standpoint, did more to respect the culture than exploit it as depicted in the film. So, definitely recommend if you read this and are still on the fence about it.

The action, inspired by Jackie Chan movies, is some of the best you’ll see all year. The villain feels more ruthless than Thanos, while still maintaining their depth. Also, there’s this like Meta-Marvel moment that’s helped by them representing Asian and Asian-American culture well, and it goes beyond that. 

It’s like, ‘you’ve trusted us through these movies, now we trust you to keep watching the story, and now we’re going to do two things. We’re going to become more inclusive, and the concepts are going to get really out there.’

Great filmmaking, cameos, humor, and casting too, of course. Speaking of which, I need to check out @norafromqueens

Because Michelle Yeoh asks Shang Chi after he tells her his father was hearing his dead mother's voice - was he wearing the rings at the time, and he replied that he never takes them off after her death.

So why did she ask him this?  What does him wearing the 10 rings have to do with the Dweller in Darkness being able to start psychically messing with him?",pgw0wk

>!So at first, I didn't think the theory that Shang Chi's mission to assassinate his mother's killer had anything to do with Katy's grandfather.  What a weird theory that was when I read it here in reddit.  But I watched the movie a second time, and in the scene with Katy's grandmother, it is said that Katy's grandfather moved from the province of Hunan in China to the US.  As I thought about it again, Shang Chi ran away upon assassinating his mother's killer - surprise surprise, Shang Chi ran away to the US, where Katy's grandfather immigrated to.!<  

>!On my second viewing of Shang Chi, I think the theory that Shang Chi assassinated Katy's grandfather is plausible, if Shang Chi assassinated Katy's grandfather in San Francisco, and then ran away from the mission, and met Katy in San Franciso shortly after.!<

>!Was Katy a character in Marvel comics before the movie was released?  What about Katy's grandfather - was he a notable character in the Marvel comics before the movie's release?  Did the comics give any clues about the killer of Shang Chi's mother that would support this theory that Shang Chi assassinated Katy's grandfather?!<",pgw0wk

There should be more representation for people that have accents... not everyone is ABC.

hbxkcx3,I thought it was pretty good. I appreciate the fight choreography but I would have liked the first couple to have been a bit more grounded before we get to the dragons and soul eaters in the 3rd act.

hcnzltj,I wonder if the Kung Fu Hustle poster was a nod to Yuen Wah being in the movie. That or the fact that Tailor fights with rings as well.,pgw0wk
hcsimba,"Great film, really loved the VFX of the ten rings, they felt so weighty and dangerous when Xu Wenwu was using them and balanced and defensive with Shang-Chi and I love some blue and orange contrast.

Xu Wenwu was my favourite character in the whole film, he really could not let go, all the power was meaningless and his grief was too strong as when he realised he made a grave mistake he gave his rings to his son instead, you could see in the end he was very proud. Loved the final dragon fight too, that other dragon had a crazy design, is that from any of the comics or original character?",pgw0wk
hcvj7fm,"Finally got to see this and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I have some qualms of course (my biggest being that I felt that Shang-Chi was a little undeveloped as a character), but the fight choreography was terrific and a lot of emotional beats hit really well. After Endgame I had started to lose interest in the MCU, and Black Widow did nothing to help that - but if we get more movies like this (where they can blend Marvel DNA with their own unique style) then I'm still on board. Definitely recommended.",pgw0wk

hf2k6s1,Entertaining movie. Fight scenes were incredible and actors did a great job portraying the characters. Third act fell flat for me. Even by marvel film standards. They had a great and emotional story within the family and butchered it in the end. Sure I like dragons and cgi is cool but I had no connection to any of that. I cared about the relationship between Shang chi’s relationship with his father and sister.,pgw0wk
hf9a0qm,"Just saw it. Good film, some great sequences and looked awesome. The while cast was great though I have to say the kabuki guy and the one armed Romanian could have been a single character, it feels like kabuki was almost entirely wasted - it kind of felt like there are a few scenes on the cutting room floor that could have explained more about that character (was he even named?). Pacing felt a little off but was a very enjoyable film about characters I know nothing about. Looking forward to seeing more of them.",pgw0wk

hkf8lmo,"This movie could have been just slightly less generic and it would be the best MCU movie. 

Expand the fighting tournament parts a bit, trim the Ta Lo parts so they're less cliche and more of a sudden 3rd act surprise, front load the family relationship so it has more of an impact in the 3rd act. 

I liked the movie, but it was so close to great that it kind of bugs me.",pgw0wk

hqsu19v,"Just watch this now that it is on Disney+ (mainly writing this for myself). My only real problem with the film was the crappy cg in the first half of the film, especially the bus fight. Everything looked rubbery and it looks like it was skipping frames (I feel like the fights were filmed at 60 and then lowered to 24 or something).

I get that the 2nd half is heavy on the cg while in the magic world but seeing people spin around looking like playdoh really took me out of it. I will note that what is there other than Cg was great and the camera work was \*chefs kiss\*.

Also the pacing also felt off, it was super fast going from the parents meeting to the bus fight and then scaffold fight in 30 mins but then sitting around talking in the compound and village for an hour and then big bad boss fight wrapped up in 20 mins.

Overall the acting was good and all the cast especially Simu and Tony deserve the recognition and even Awkwafina was good enough to not annoy me with her type of character.

Edit: Also felt there were too many people for everybody to develop. There was that random ninja who trained them and razorfist, their aunt and the bow dude you just pop up out of nowhere and act like they've know each other for ages. And then the sister who felt like a waste. Could have definitely done with being a movie about family and just cut Awkwafina out instead. Felt like a lot of loose threads that went nowhere or were unnecessary.",pgw0wk
hbrm395,"It feels like it was better than I expected.  I didn't enjoy myself.  Yet, it was still better than I expected.   I think that's because it wasn't a Shang-Chi film.  Sure, they had to revise his origin to avoid connection to the Fu-Manchu origin story, but they could had... something.  Father is his arch-rival?  Nope.  His dad lies to him, and sends him after a good-guy?  Nope.  He fights against his dad's orginization?  Nope.  Fighting people trying to steal your necklace isn't the same thing.  Master of Kung-Fu?  Maybe in the future, but not now.  Good at it, but not a master.  Strength of Character?  He let himself go along with things far too much.    But, I felt like I would have enjoyed it, if I wasn't looking for any connections to the stories I have known. 

It feels like it should be rudderless, if he isn't inspired in any way by Shang-Chi.  Yet, it felt like it wasn't.  It felt like it was a story the people who made it wanted to tell, with a coat of paint thrown over it to make it look like something else, so that people would buy tickets to see that story.  Not the one they were expecting.  But what story is it, really, if not about Shabg-Chi?  Well, I think at it's core, it's really just a trap to get us to learn the lessons of ""[Crimson Defender vs The Slightly Racist Family](https://www.angelnavarrofilms.com/portfolio-item/crimson-defender-vs-slightly-racist-family/)"", a short film directed by, and starring Simu Liu, the same guy who played ""Shang-Chi"".  I think you can guess the plot.  A family is rescued by a superhero, and object that he can't be white enough to be Superhero. ""people need to know that superheroes do not and should not only come in white, or even only in white and black. That's where Crimson comes in."", said the director.",pgw0wk

She already brings up how when things got hard she would drop it and find something new.

I tried my best to overlook it, until they walked INTO A FUCKING VILLAGE THAT HAD BEEN ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF EARTH FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

It’s already a lot better than black panther in that they at least tried to incorporate some Chinese into the film instead of pretending an entire foreign nation speaks English as it’s mother-tongue but it still couldn’t commit to it. I’m Taiwanese and you wouldn’t catch me dead speaking English to any of my Chinese relatives, even those who also speak fluent English.

I don’t care that aliens speak English in the MCU, whatever. But when you make films about other cultures and countries, it’s a tad disrespectful and weird to white wash their fucking speech.

The “humor” fell flat and didn’t land with anyone in the audience. 

There was not a single redeeming quality about this film, and from what I am reading it just gets worse as the movie goes on.

This film is essentially led by a martial artist who can't act and a comedian who isn't funny and also can't act. The fight scene are ok but hell I have seen better even in Netflix Daredevil.

I know that Rotten Tomatoes are very forgiving for Marvel films but double 90s is just an insult. This film is at best 45% and you simply cannot compare it to say Captain America First Avenger or Black Panther.

The scaffolding was pretty sweet. It was a bit dark, but that part when he had to save Katy, he freaking B-Lined it to her, parkouring through those scaffolding and eliminating enemies as quickly and efficiently as he can. Camera angles were amazing.  


The 1 on 1 vs that Lead ""ninja"" was top notch.",pgw0wk
hbmu86t,"Honestly, this superhero marvel movie for the first half felt really close to a hong kong movie. Not a lot of quick cuts and amazing fight choreography. Also i loved seeing wah yuen in this movie (landlord from kung fu hustle)",pgw0wk

hbk8vti,"I kept getting distracted by all the inaccuracies. You can't ""cut a bus' brake lines"", and a bus driver would get in WAY more trouble for having earbuds in than ignoring a fight in progress. The scene was funny and I loved it when they crashed into a garbage truck but I got really distracted by that brake nonsense. 

Sometimes they deliberately misrepresent how stuff works so people don't try it at home but in this case I think the writers just didn't know anything about commercial vehicles.",pgw0wk

Not necessarily to be as distinctly ice ring, light ring, etc. But as used in the movie, they were basically way cool repulsors.

hcvhv4h,I know that this response is super late but I just had to chime in - I couldn't agree more. When I saw the first trailer I thought that using the rings like that was honestly so stupid and I lost interest in the movie. But when reviews dropped and said how good it was (in particular the fight choreography) I decided to give it a shot and enjoyed the movie immensely. The rings were used in some really awesome creative ways,pgw0wk

hcd2vpq,"I totally disagree - in some way. I'd love for this to be a relationship. She / their relationship would be SO MUCH BETTER than any other in a Marvel movie. She is funny and fiercely loyal and not overly feminized (but still has style). She also brings a down-to-earth quality in the midst of the supernatural abilities. 

One of the reason I hadn't watched some of the male lead movies lately is because of how poor the female romantic interests are written. Lifeless and there only as a plot point.

But Katy is awesome and their dynamic feels more like a real relationship (when she teases him with his name choice I immediately thought of me and my own partner).

That being said - I do like the idea that if a relationship has started then it wasn't an immediate passionate kiss and the cliches. If it could transition to a real relationship without being overly sappy that would be ideal.",pgw0wk

hcmxwe0,"I have mixed feelings about this. As an Asian man in a western world, I feel like the vast majority of us has been desexualzized or unromanticized in the media. It’s getting better now. But for an Asian male lead to be be like the only character without a romantic female love interest in the MCU seems like it’s another de-sexualization/romanticism of Asian men trope. Yes there are shirtless shots of Simu, but it isn’t enough imo. On paper there’s literally no reason for him and Katy to not be together, yet they must remain “platonic” for whatever reason.

hipq5kp,"Not that Shang Chi doesn’t deserve a love interest because that’s just playing into Hollywood stereotypes but it definitely would have felt out of place and horrible writing if they did kiss because they (the writers / director?) didn’t really hint at it at any point throughout the movie.

If they wanted them to be a thing, they would have written/hinted at it earlier with scenes or scripts or whatever. The reason people say they don’t have romantic chemistry is because the script didn’t allow for it. You can’t act out a platonic relationship script and make it romantic. 

It was definitely odd not to have any love interest for a film because I feel Marvel does that just naturally (Except Black Widow)",pgw0wk

He never did the stereotype villain thing of refusing to give up power. He did give it away, for his wife and family. He only took up the rings again because she got murdered.

Edit: Just want to mention that the parent comments translation isn't entirely accurate. A closer translation would be, ""**I've eaten more salt than you've eaten rice""** or ""**I've eaten more salt than you've eaten food**"".  


Edit 2: Parent comment has updated their translation.",pgw0wk
hbezjtq,"Wow, that translation is more of a burn than a “respect your elders” reminder. Were there any other parts where subbing didn’t fully translate too?",pgw0wk
hbf9i9y,How was the spoken Chinese in the movie? Like was it accurate and believable,pgw0wk
hbibylu,"Another translation that was a letdown was the translation of “hún dàn” to “guy”. Maybe it was PG but it really should’ve been “bastard”. 

Lots of emotions lost in the translation.

Also, “你是我的骄傲” translated to “I’m proud of you” felt weird. Maybe something like “you’re my pride”?

Idk, it felt less poetic.",pgw0wk
hbg3uwo,"The fact that he said it to the fucking Landlord himself Yuen Wah was mad. Tony's a legend but to say that to an older veteran actor, especially for us Chinese where respect for elders is stressed upon, made it funnier.",pgw0wk

I did not know this! Holy shit they should've kept this instead.",pgw0wk
hbit1gr,That’s absolutely the line of the movie for me. I nearly screamed “fuck yeah” when I heard Tony Leung speak that line with so much sass and confidence. It’s like “don’t talk shit boy I’m about to whoop your ass” and I’m all for it.,pgw0wk
hbjjy2o,Can you shed some light on the scene where they talk about the importance of names? What does Tony's character's name translate to in English?  Same for Katy / Akwafina's character also has a Chinese name - What is the significance?,pgw0wk

hg7qvul,"37 days late but u have to take in context the entire show. Wenwu has lived for millennia while Deng Bo has at most lived for a century (hence the contextual used translation of I’ve lived ten of your lifetimes). But the actual meaning of it is a combination of both u/5-On-A-Toboggan and u/I_am_BEOWULF explanation: that salt in Chinese culture can be taken to mean hardship and that salt is used in meals sparingly when compared to rice in chinese cuisine. But the true roast comes when you compare the physical appearance of Wenwu and Deng Bo: Wenwu looks half of Deng Bo’s age. Now with these 4 points, rewatch the scene again and you can laugh at that line",pgw0wk

hbik9w7,After 30 years working in Asian cinema and winning so many accolades it’s surprising that he’s only making his Hollywood debut now. l’m sure he must’ve turned down a lot of roles. It shows the strength of this script that he accepted it.,pgw0wk
hbg5tof,"Watched Hard Boiled last night. He is fantastic in that. Chow Yun-fat is great in the film as well as cool tough cop Tequila, but Tony Leung has the more interesting character in Alan that showcases a more nuanced acting performance. The warehouse scene in particular has some terrific acting by Leung. I haven't seen a lot of Tony Leung's films and I've yet to see his Wong Kar-wai films, but people say he is one of the best actors for acting and conveying emotion with just his eyes. And there is some great eye acting in Hard Boiled. Also Hard Boiled is one of the best Hong Kong action films. It's insane and beautifully choreographed. I am looking forward to Shang Chi just to see more of Tony Leung. I'm sure the film is also really fun, but Tony Leung.",pgw0wk

hbjjmhu,I have never seen him in anything honestly but he is a really good actor and I am surprised this was hid first american movie.,pgw0wk
hbl5ncb,"In one of Tony's earlier movies, A city of Sadness, he plays a deaf mute character and carries the whole movie by his expressions and body language alone. He's easily the most naturally talented actor HK ever had.",pgw0wk
hbml66d,"Lol I have watched just one Chinese/Hong Kong film in my life: In The Mood For Love, about 15 years ago. When I read in the IMDb trivia that he is a famous Chinese/Hong Kong actor, I clicked to see if I had ever heard of any of his movies. I chuckled to see the coincidence",pgw0wk

hbiemzt,"> The Mood For Love and Chungking Express

too highbrow for capeshitters",pgw0wk
hbhpi6r,"Tony Leung was awesome. The story and writing however I felt wasted his talent.

His character came off as a bit dim at the end. He's portrayed as though he has all of his faculties, and genuinely believe his wife is somehow behind the gate somehow. Yet whilst he's beating it apart, with bizarre flying alien creatures coming out, he doesn't think something is up? The character also came off as too flat for me.

Those aspects are the fault of the writing and the screenplay. I felt they wasted his talent. Thankfully not as bad as how much they wasted Ray Winstone in Black Widow.",pgw0wk
hbwr48l,Yeah i mean it's like saying Al Pacino over shadowed everyone. He was my guarantee factor to watch this.,pgw0wk

hbf8xks,"I love and really hope we're getting a characterization of Wong as a globetrotting cosmic sorcerer-- with a shitload of side-hustles. Just have Wong showing up everywhere, fixing fights with Abomination, selling thousand year eggs in San Fransisco, showing up in Wakanda to consult on spirit communion, then teaching a class in Young Avengers. Have him show up in Hawkeye and it's like ""Wong, why are you here?"" ""Three card monte, want to play?""",pgw0wk

Bruce is Bruce and not Professor Hulk, Captain Marvel is back to her long haired look despite apparently not that much time passing since Endgame.  I think all of these are little hints that this movie is not taking place in the ""Prime"" MCU universe.  With things starting to go into multi-verse territory I think we're going to start seeing a lot of stories begin to play out in alternate universes with them all eventually coming together in the next ""Avengers level"" movie.",pgw0wk

Sadly I left the theater feeling underwhelmed. I felt like I was watching a DISNEY movie not a Marvel movie. It felt like Mulan. 

Sure I enjoyed the fighting and the CGI was good. Tony Leung was absolutely amazing but something just didn't click. 

Tony has been fighting for thousands of years yet he didn't use the signature move that he used when attacking the whole army even once. 

He knew who he was and didn't figure someone will come for his family. 

He didn't see the monster flying out of the gate where he was hoping his wife was kept. 

I have been invested in comic books in general for 25 years and I am a vivid fan of Marvel`s cinematic universe. As a kid I was paying they will stop just changing actors playing superheroes in every damn movie and make something bigger. 

I am spoiled now with the MCU movies as most of them have a very good scripts with twists and things that make you think. I didn't see those qualities here, most things felt rushed (Female friend learns to shoot a bow in a matter of hours (or a day) and proceeds to save the heroes...  I was more invested in Tony`s flashbacks. 

I don't think finding a magical creature (by chance) to get them to the portal was the best explanation they could have come up with. The BIG BAD was a soulsucker that no one really cared about as he was introduced mere moments before it appeared. Shang was about to drown when suddenly the dragon appears beneath him and he starts riding. 

I mean it was a good visual, with good fighting, good CGI and some good acting (Ben Kingsley and Tony stole the show) but the story itself was pretty dumbed down, there were no real spins, no controversy. 

Maybe that`s because we are just starting with Marvel phase 4 but I the first after credit scene gave me more to think about then the whole movie.

After all of this I am asking you to help me out, understanding if I missed something big and I really want to know didn't you feel at least some of the things I am talking about.

P.S Sorry for my English it`s 4 in the morning and I can barely think",pgw0wk

There were so many things that I related to: from trying to explain how to properly pronounce your Chinese name to being called Korean (growing up someone asked me if I was Korean), there were just SO many small things in there that really tied it to the Asian American experience. I remember when Crazy Rich Asians came out and so many were hailing it for representation, but I was super annoyed in that there was nothing really relatable about it. Shang Chi is so much more relatable.

I didn’t really like her character in this. I don’t generally go for zany sidekick characters to begin with, so the random injections of comedy were kinda eye-rolling for me. She didn’t really do anything most of the movie, but her skills as a driver came into play a few times so I’ll give her her that. 

Her archery during the final battle felt really unearned though. I feel like it would have been easy to set up that she used to compete as a kid but got bored and gave it up. Like they *almost* did that with her conversation with the woman on their walk to the range, but the dialogue doesn’t imply that she specifically has previous experience with a bow. And then nobody else during the battle thinks to aim at the monsters very obvious weak spot?

That made no sense, especially when they set up that WenWu only has access once a year but the others can get there immediately. Also XiaLing changed her clothing and Katy was speaking Chinese fluently. I thought for sure it was a few months. Kinda weird disconnect with that line.

Like when i hear non-asians praise us for being so family oriented and such close-knit units, i dont think they see the other side of that sword: being so involved with your family means youre bound to run into more frequent and deeper conflicts with them. The reality of the concept of family is that youre often inheriting people that you may not like, people that you may not agree with, people that you might even be ultimately and irreconcilably incompatible with. But you force yourselves to stay together and get along for the sake of blood relations. Would you still choose these people in your lives if you met them as non blood related strangers in the street? Like the stereotype that asians that dont dare say things to your face and beat around the bush and wont speak up (which i think is somewhat grounded in the chinese values that disagreeing/disobeying/overriding your parents is an unconscionable and disrespectful act), i wonder if that behavior was a survival mechanism adopted by asians to reduce conflict because we’d be at our own family’s throats all the time otherwise",pgw0wk

I was so thrown by this character. Usually when there's a recurring, threatening figure in a mask, at some point the mask is removed and it's revealed that they were actually [someone] all along. But I guess it was just an unnamed henchman with a cool mask? Fair enough!",pgw0wk

It feels like the film wanted to be a number of different films, and suffered for it.

Edit; the music was really a good addition!",pgw0wk
hbrx051,"Here’s how I would write it, personally: 


Everything is the same up until Shang-chi and his posse arrive in Ta Lo. Shang-chi tells them about how Wenwu believes that there’s some dark gate. The villagers have no idea what he’s talking about. There is no gate. There is no dark being held behind a dragonscale gate. The voice in Wenwu’s head is simply his own wishful thinking. 


So, we get to the Ten Rings invading Ta Lo. Battle goes on as normal, with Wenwu himself breaking away to head for where he thinks the gate is. Shang-chi follows him. They fight, but Wenwu wins and makes it to the mountain. 


The sheer cliff face stares at him, a billion tons of rock informing him of his error. He blasts away at the face with the rings, unable to believe he was lying to himself. Shang-chi arrives, having nearly died and found balance as he does in the movie, but no dragon. 


Shang-chi doesn’t want to kill his father, and initially refuses to fight him. But Wenwu engages, and Shang-chi is forced to duel his father. They battle, the rings passing between them as either fighter occasionally takes possession of some or all of them. Eventually, though, the rings are knocked away, and father and son come to blows with fists and words, two unpowered masters of the martial arts duking it out. But Shang-chi is just an iota faster, the most miniature gap stronger. After a few minutes of combat, he has his father at his mercy. But he refuses to take Wenwu’s life. He breaks down, unwilling to murder his own father, to break his family further. Wenwu takes advantage of this, knocks Shang-chi down, and goes for the rings. 


Wenwu, at this moment, has his son at his mercy, the insolent wretch who betrayed him and tried to keep him from his wife. With one strike, he could end Shang-chi like he did the gangers who helped kill his beloved. Then, suddenly, self-awareness. He looks into the eyes of his child, the thing he was so certain he wanted to give up everything for. He realizes in a second that his wife is gone, and to continue this would be nothing more than destroying her memory. He yields, breaking down as the weight of his loss finally settles in. The immortal man, solving that cruel irony, finally begins to grow up, to move on. 


In doing so he gives the rings to his son. He can’t carry them any longer. He has to move forward, and that includes the passage of time. After a thousand years, he may finally rest. 


And so Shang-chi doesn’t save the world, doesn’t rescue it in the last moment from total annihilation. But he saves his world, his family. And I think that’s enough.",pgw0wk

hbv60v2,"I agree with you to an extent. *Black Widow*, *Spider-Man: Far From Home*, *What If?* and to an extent, *Falcon and the Winter Soldier* felt like a lot of backtracking and table-setting that really took the wind out of Phase 4's sails. *Shang-Chi*, *Loki*, and *WandaVision* felt like the only things moving the overarching story forward. I'm tired of everything focusing on or deriving from *Endgame*. We get it, the world gets it, please move on. 

I liked how here it was just a quick reference or two to the Blip, and some posters on Shaun's apartment building talking about support groups for Blip/Snap survivors. I'm concerned *Eternals* is going to make the same mistake, given how heavily the trailers seem to be focusing on Thanos's death/the Blip being the cause of yet another alien invasion. 

But we'll see. I'd much rather they focus on breaking the multiverse for now (between Loki, Wanda, Peter, and Stephen, the universe looks fucked) and leave the Blip in the past. I don't think it would have seemed so overdone if everything had gone according to plan in real life, but it's now been almost three real-life years since the Snap and I'm tired of it being the impetus for everything going forward.",pgw0wk

hbnbils,"I can understand Killmonger's logic despite it being quite radical. Wenwu has lived a super long time so should be smart, yet he ignores all stated reason that the voice isn't his wife's. So while Tony Leung's performance is incredible, I can't take his character seriously",pgw0wk
hbglbxy,"I thought the CGI was inconsistent. Some of the shots looked really good, others terrible. It was super obvious what shots of the bus exterior were CG and which were practical. And when he's fighting his dad and he comes out of the smoke w/ the rings around him, I thought the smoke/compositing there nearly ruined the moment. 

And yet the creatures and the water map scene and other parts were perfect. I'd think Marvel would have better CG quality control at this point",pgw0wk
hbi2xh4,"It's interesting, because I had the exact opposite effect! I love everything Marvel puts out, and I loved this, but I was bored in the middle of the film and kept thinking to myself ""man this movie is long"".

I like aspects of this movie, but there were some tonal shifts that didn't sit well with me. I like the fantasy world building, but I honestly thought the conflict with his father and the Ten-Rings was more compelling... I know Marvel is showing they can make other genres, but I don't know why, I just wasn't jiving with the fantasy realm stuff. I loved it, but for some reason when we got to Ta-Lo, things felt odd.

I think for me it was because Ta-lo was mainly a rushed set piece. We have way too much jammed into such a mysterious place, and it made the world feel small, which made it not believable for me. We only ever saw Ta-Lo from that opening meadow and then that one shrine like structure, with the scary mountain backdrop. Where was the village for ALL of the people there?

Again, I enjoyed the movie, but to me, this is like Black Panther. I think I would have enjoyed if this focused more on just the Ten Rings, or focused more on just Ta-Lo (or give it more time to explore Ta-Lo without adding to the length of the movie).

Aside from my grievances, the acting was pretty outstanding.  Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Michelle Yeoh (obviously) stood out to me. I also really liked the fight sequences. I love seeing how they use the Rings when they fight. I am excited for more Shang-Chi",pgw0wk

hbk4qew,"> I understand Reddit's disdain to the CCP and the 'forced' diversity that Hollywood is moving towards. 

This shit just makes me kinda sad. Firstly, anyone who harbors ill will toward an entire culture because of a shitty political regime needs to get their head straight. Chinese people are not the CCP. Hell, they're the main *victims* of the CCP.

Secondly, ""forced diversity"" is such a bad take and I just don't understand it. What force? Who's being forced? I'm a white dude, but I've already seen a thousand movies about white dudes (and it's not like they've stopped making those anyway). A more diverse set of characters and creators just means I get to watch lots of new kinds of stories I haven't seen before. It's a win-win scenario.

Like, I've seen people talking shit about reviewers giving ""points for representation"", which... first of all, I don't think they are, but if they were, *so what?* Movies regularly get praised for doing something new. Improved representation is one way to do something new. I've never seen a goddamn wrestling match between two dragons in a magical Chinese fairy land before, *that's something new*.

shang chi on the other hand had a great family dynamic and it really did feel like Shang chi and Katy were friends for 10 years. The villain wenwu had a lot more depth as a character than just a cartoony bad guy you see in a lot of these movies. there was no indication that Shang chi enjoyed anything his dad put him through, thought it was obvious he ran away because the assassin life wasn’t the life he wanted.

It's pretty obvious why Shang Chi ran away and the comments agreeing with you are sad. The guy watched his mom get beaten to death. Then his dad went and slaughtered people right in front of him. Shang Chi was 7. Then he was abused for 7 more years with incredibly intense training and beatings while the father showed no love. Then he murdered someone and while he could justify it as revenge it probably also fucked him in the head as well. He ran away to get away from the cycle of violence and he's basically doing nothing because he's depressed and wanting some normalcy",pgw0wk

hbmdolp,">n he first appeared it kinda broke my immersion because felt so random. Xu Wenwu's motivation felt really silly and somewhat forced, it was illogical. I would expect someone who lived thousands of years to be smart. I thought movie was going to be about Shang-Chi surpassing his father (there's a Chinese phrase for that: 青出於藍), but then Soulsucker robs Shang-Chi of that opportunity. I feel like the first half of movie was stronger than 2nd half. Did Shang-Chi really grow as a character in movie? It's a great film, and I'm so happy that overseas Asians in the West can finally have their own superheroes, and that Asian children can have a superhero to look up to. For that reason, seeing yourself represented on the big screen, the Hollywood recognition that we exist, it's really satisfying. Awkwafina slayed in the film, movie definitely had plenty haha moments. I don't know the origin source so no idea if that limited movie or if movie is loosely based on that and mainly went its own route. Movie has some flaws, but I'm totally okay with overlooking them because movie is significant, Hollywood showing strong Asian Americans that aren't stereotypes. I was the only Asian in my theater, I feel like most of the audience are already Marvel fans as they were able to get Marvel jokes I didn't. So I can't wait to see more of Shang-Chi amongst Marvel and I hope movie shatters box office so we can have more films with Asian Americans! (yea I know Simu is Asian Canadian, you know what I mean)

Trevor Slattery was in Iron Man 3, and when he came up I thought finally they've done him justice and it was a good homage to ""Mandarin"" and how his role was cut short in that film (won't tell you more than that as it will be spoilers). So for me (and those who watched all the other marvel movies) it was great to see him.

And as I've already said above, I think a lot of development for Shang Chi's character happened before the film as per the flash backs of his younger self (fill in the blanks sort of thing). That's what I felt anyway. During the film it was just a consolidation of his past and acceptance rather than character development.",pgw0wk

I see what you mean about the iconography though.

hbosbki,"I guess the most interesting part of the third act to me was Wenwu and his motives. They did a great job building his character to where when he was being deceived it made total sense why he would believe it and go to the lengths he did, even as it became more and more obvious he was wrong with the demons flying out.

And then there's the fight between Shang Chi and Wenwu in act 3, a lot of people here for some reason are stating we didn't get a satisfying fight between them. But in my eyes we got that fight and it was great. You could see the father respecting Shang more and more as the fight went on, up to that last moment where he sacrifices himself to save Shang, so of course Shang is going to show some grief. And Shang taking control of the rings was epic.

After a first watch, black panther might have looked odd. You might have expected more from the action scenes and so on. But when you go back and re-watch it, the movie is trying to talk about things that no one would dare. The overall theme was interesting and it makes you question your real world as well. If a country like Wakanda can use its technology to conquer the world, why should they just share it for free aka USA? Especially after what has been done to African-Americans. They touch on a lot of very good points. 

As for Shang-Chi how is this movie changing its audience's perspective? What is this movie doing for the asian community? Nothing. Such a cliche movie honestly. And I agree, Awkwafina should have stayed a side role. Like her throwing the arrow was just too much honestly. What are they trying to prove? Every asian knows martial arts and archery?

hkvu1fm,"You would be wrong then. I'm Chinese and I thought the movie is fine. Kinda middle of the road for Marvel origin stories plot wise. They created their own mythology that's inspired by Chinese ones without referencing anything specific, that's just Disney playing it safe and try not to offend anyone by adapting real mythology wrong. They did a similar thing with Wakanda in Black Panther by amalgamating different African cultural references, and some people didn't like it either. As far as martial arts is concerned, you might be surprised to know that not everyone like Chinese martial arts movies. It has its own tempo, rhymes, and tropes. They did something middle of the road that's still accessible to general population, without going full-on Ip Man or Kung Fu Hustle, probably because they also have to consider how Shang Chi will play with the rest of the MCU cast in the future choreography-wise.

I don't mind if the movie still had its over the to parts because it's a marvel movie, but I mean I feel like it could've been like these less extreme Marvel films.

He won’t stop. They fight. And Shang-chi can’t do it. He shows his dad how pointless it was. He beats him and in this, with respect to culture, it’s a big deal. He gets through to him. Bad guy breaks out. Tony’s character sacrifices himself because he really does love him. And he in that moment realized how blinded by grief he was and that his son was strong enough to stand up against him. He doesn’t have to worry about him being killed like his wife. It’s a really beautiful moment. Tony’s character was living in fear up until that point. Almost every action was fear based.

The movie was a 10/10 for me up until the last 1/3 where it became as you said a CGI clusterf***. 

It would have been better if they ditched the Dragon fight and had a personal one-on-one with Shang-Chi and The Mandarin. A pure Kung-fu fight after Shang ditches the rings. Then Shang convinces him that his mum is truly dead then he allows himself to get soul-sucked due to grief.

And in my wildest dreams they would include a concept where if you get souls sucked you see you worst nightmare so they can have a way to include that Iron Man fight we deserved from Iron man 3.

The minute he showed up he clearly included her through the rest of the film. I couldn't get a sense from the movie whether or not she was left out because of her sex or that she was the second child. I'm sorta curious because China is sexist towards women it's a whole thing where women are considered lesser class than men to this day.

hbhi3q9,"Agreed 100 percent. I was saying the same thing - I felt I was watching jackie chan style action and choreography. It felt good to see action sequences that can breathe and aren't riddled with so many quick cuts that you can't even appreciate the action. 

The story indeed had a lot of heart, and when you dig into it you realize the film is basically a family drama, which I feel is a big thing in chinese mythology/folklore. Agreed on Awkafina. She's definitely over the top, to the point where she was annoying, but the film managed to give her a solid arc that wraps up pretty neatly in the end. I say the film didn't overdo it with the jokes, and ties up the Trevor Slattery arc very well.

 The film had moments that didn't work but overall the best parts of the film completely overshadow the worst parts. 8/10 is definitely a fitting rating.",pgw0wk
hbkcgct,A lot. Mandarin is heavily present,pgw0wk
hbs2r5k,i'm sure he did most of it. here's a [small clip](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTPhGmbFqq6/) of him training for one of the bus stunts. there's more on his page as well,pgw0wk
hbqo9zi,"If take you away the rings hes still a top tier Character. Hell, Hawkeye and BW were in the Avengers and I'm pretty sure Shang Chi can beat both.",pgw0wk
hbrn5k9,It made less sense in this movie than any of the other ones.,pgw0wk
hbf3udf,Kate bishop will be.,pgw0wk
hbspq7o,I found her inclusion in the post credits so weird. She fired 1 good shot and now she's part of the gang? She's a better driver than archer,pgw0wk
hbplng3,I personally didn’t think this movie played it safe. They really went in on the Chinese fantasy route. It almost didn’t feel like a Marvel movie until the mid-credit scene when Captain Marvel and normal Bruce Banner showed up.,pgw0wk
hbqk2m3,"This is one of the least Marvel movies in the MCU. 

It included the world of the MCU, the events, and the characters, yet it felt entirely self contained in a lot of ways.

It was also far from safe, given it leaned heavily into the fantasy, mystic style of older Chinese movies. Crouching Tiger as the biggest example.

So you could call it safe because the hero won, and it follows the sidekick cliche, but so much about this is pretty outside the usual zone of marvel movies.

Yeah we've seen Thor fight a fire giant, and we've seen a talking raccoon, but traditional Chinese mythos is still extremely common so it felt rather jarring (in a good way) to see it all brought to life on screen like that.",pgw0wk
hc7eshc,What are you talking about? Shang-Chi is even more popular with audiences than Black Panther was,pgw0wk
hbrskx0,The movie is called Shang-chi and you’re complaining there are too many Asians? That’s like asking where all the white Wakandans are.,pgw0wk
hbecnyf,hopefully soon...waiting on the weekly planet pod recap,pgw0wk
hbew6rv,Im happy they didn’t need to add a stupid kiss last second,pgw0wk

hbep0k8,Should be ok. No over the top violence and nothing sexual,pgw0wk
hberg3q,[deleted],pgw0wk
hbhghbq,Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is itself a tribute to the whole wuxia genre :) but I think it’s telling that a movie like Shang-Chi is bringing wuxia back to the west the same way Crouching Tiger did 2 decades ago.,pgw0wk
hbg9arq,She did mention Kamehameha .,pgw0wk
hbheu5t,"I’m speculating, but in the MCU, since the Ten Rings had existed throughout much of modern history, it was probably known or rumored that the Ten Rings’ leader was of Chinese origin. I’m assuming Killian created ‘The Mandarin’ persona and claimed to be the leader of the Ten Rings perhaps not believing Wenwu existed or thinking he would be safe from retaliation. It also sort of calls back to the racist undertone of the era that created The Mandarin and Fu Manchu I think, so it actually works as a retcon for Killian’s motivations.",pgw0wk
hbfckt5,She left Ta lo,pgw0wk
hbgl4pu,"The dad, in order to get them in the same place",pgw0wk
hbgjriu,"You see the evil dudes show up, then her body laying there dead after they leave. I think that was enough. Don’t know that we needed to watch a group of thugs murder her.",pgw0wk
hbgd1ye,That was lost on me.  I didn't even realize the guy was in another Marvel movie.,pgw0wk
hbh4k1o,i feel like this is the nonsensical rage that has infumed him making his thoughts and feelings irrational.,pgw0wk
hbguekm,Yeh for real. I don't even think Wenwu could've saved her at the point since he gave up the rings.,pgw0wk
hbh4wgb,"Not saying I have experienced this, but if you look experiences where someone dies during childbirth for example, often there is internalized resentment toward the child, despite it not being the child’s fault… I felt like this was a great subtle insight into why Wenwu would have trained Shang-chi so hard to be a killer after his wife’s death, likely because he felt his children were too soft, also considering he had only known war for the last 1000 years and not been involved in domestic life at all during that period of time. So it definitely was an unreasonable expectation, but also ties back into the character’s flaws, in addition to how he was deceived into opening the door for the soul eater.",pgw0wk
hbh4bhr,Those two should be sufficient - no other significant links within the body of the film itself.,pgw0wk
hbh45in,"Is it worth watching anything in 3D nowadays, with everything being post-converted instead of shot in 3D? I am hoping to check out IMAX on my rewatch, I feel like the audio alone will be worth it.",pgw0wk
hbhckej,Didn't even know it was available in 3d which probably means it's a shitty 3d conversion instead of a film being filmed intentionally in 3d,pgw0wk
hbiemn7,I'd go for a theater with a great sound system because the music really amplifies the fights in this one. Friends and I did RPX (also larger screen) and it was well worth the extra money for the immersion.,pgw0wk
hbh1q3o,It will probably tie in with Eternals movie.,pgw0wk
hbhfcdm,This is super plausible and I def see it happening that way.,pgw0wk

hbhz673,I wish they’d show that only certain ppl can have the rings.  Right now it seems like anybody can have them and use them.,pgw0wk
hbib2fr,I wish Marvel would release that exposition dump to youtube.  I failed to keep up with what was being explained and walk out of the movie wondering if the people of Ta Lo were aliens like Asgardians.,pgw0wk
hbi9idp,The third act of both Black Widow and Shang Chi were the weakest part of those movies.,pgw0wk
hbi7q3y,Two of them.,pgw0wk
hbihkgc,Iron man: They mention in the movie that the 10 rings name was adopted and mis-used at that time.,pgw0wk
hbibkai,"Before watching this, I heard the last third of the movie suffers like a lot of other superhero movies. With that in mind, I wasn't too disappointed, but it was more that I loved the first half of the movie and basically everything in the other dimension was meh. The creature designs were good, but it was like I was watching a MCU movie and somebody changed it to Raya and the Last Dragon.",pgw0wk

But this time, the Dweller knows better, and has reached out to the one person who actually *is* strong enough to break down the gate, but he's only strong enough because he has the rings. If he weren't wearing them, he'd be no threat.",pgw0wk

hbmlkpl,He has somehow reverted to just Banner. This is clearly post-Endgame Bruce given that (among other things) his hand was in a sling.,pgw0wk
hbmln5s,He was in Iron Man 3. I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it.,pgw0wk
hbmoqrs,"Trevor Slattery was an actor paid to play the part of the leader of the Ten Rings organization and was a callback to Iron Man 3 (which you should see if you want to get the other references in Shangchi)... he called himself The Mandarin... in short he was built up to be the villain in IM3 but was just an actor... (not a spoiler if you watched Shangchi and didn't watch IM3)..

obviously wenwu was the leader of the Ten Rings .. so when he found out .. he found Trevor and was about to kill him but was entertaining enough to be kept around as a jester... this part was explained in Shangchi...",pgw0wk

hboor42,Bill is a shorten name of William.,pgw0wk
hbqpw08,"He said when Shang was using the rings it activated something that all the wizards of Kamar Taj could sense, that was not previously activated when Wenwu was using them. I think this comes from shang’s mom being a descendant of whoever had control of the rings in the first place. This is why Shang and his mother could make the rings do other things (like float around and glow gold) that Wenwu couldnt",pgw0wk
hbowxis,"I’m  guessing Wong have tried it o contact the dad in the past but he just rejected Wong. Now that the rings has a new holder, he figured he’d try again with the kid.",pgw0wk

hbs5j5g,"> maybe it was because it didn’t felt like a Marvel film and more like a Monster Hunter/ Avatar (animated show) / Asian ‘Clash of the Titans’

I do like the fights that were a bit more grounded. The final fight had a bit too much CGI for me. Not so much the rings, but I didn't expect dragons and stuff.

The way Shang and Katy were portrayed though felt (most of the time) platonic, any hints at romance would have felt out of place. This is not because they didn’t have “chemistry” or anything like that but because everyone involved in writing their characters didn’t hint at it during the most (all?) of the movie.

If they did want them to be a thing, they would have wrote it into the scenes or scripts, they weren’t “allowed” to portray romantic attraction if that makes sense. You (Awkwafina and Simu) can’t act out a platonic friendship script and make it romantic, which is why they didn’t “feel” like a couple throughout the movie.

 - Steven Yeun in TWD  
 - Henry Golding in Last Christmas  

It's one of those things where you don't want to unnecessarily force romance into a movie, or for the sake of a character happening to be a certain race.

Was it actually? I could have sworn back in 2013, there was some outrage (unsure on the extent) that they wrote out the Mandarin as a villain. Might have been partially due to the racist history of him or that Asian men are invisible in media and this was another jab at writing out a potential character. And so they release the “All hail the king” short to write them back in.

The fact that they did it a year later made me think it was an afterthought or a reaction to the comments. Also because Marvel decided they had no place in the infinity saga so they had to wait until phase 4.

Marvel are certainly capable of “modernising” their comic book characters regardless of their history which is why I always think it was weird when I hear that they didn’t want to do X decision back on some racial history.",pgw0wk

My parents did that with my first sister and I, and she had behavioral issues that made being with her unpleasant.

For this particular scene, as the cognitive dissonance was dissipating, I burst out laughing at what he actually said. Sick burn. 

All the same, objectively, the subtitles serve their purpose, especially for non-native speakers. Ironically, despite not being transliterations, I would say that the subtitles were mostly *more* literal than the actual dialogue. They say more than the actors do, and that meant that sometimes the translations would create different characters than what just the dialogue would portray. I felt that especially with Tony Leung, where a lot of his subtitles had added info that made him less nuanced than what he acted. >!For example, when he arrives at the gate to save his wife, the subtitles say ""I'm here, my love"", whereas he literally only says ""I'm here"" -- the implied endearment baked into the brevity of his words is all but washed away with the translation.

If you think about it, it's actually pretty alienating that people can't pronounce your name or remember it unless you change it.

If you want to see Tony Leung seduce another martial artist via kung fu fighting, also like in Shang-chi, ""The Grandmaster"" is a good place to start.

If you want to watch a slow burning yet intense romance/drama where Tony Leung is burning holes into panties with conflicted, seductive glares, there's ""in the Mood for Love"" on HBOmax. He doesn't do this in Shang-chi unfortunately.

To him simu will always be that scared little boy that watched his mother die. But they could both be redeemed on the other side of the scales. But let's be real, Wenwu lives in a different world. He was forged and metal'd by war. But I was really surprised at how Shang-chi really affects him with his response after Wenwu chides him about his mother's death. When Shang-chi says where were you? Man. You can tell how much he loved his family by how much that hurt him. It woke him up. Wenwu doesn't get challenged. He topples countries... So to even be affected by words like that.

Then Shang-chi comes out of nowhere and kills him with love. Wild.",pgw0wk

I'm really looking forward to Shang-Chi's sister taking over the 10 rings honestly, her drive to have an empire of her own after being abandoned by her brother and neglected by her father feels like it could be really compelling to me, and her and Shang never really made up in the end.",pgw0wk

Dimensions were something introduced in Dr. Strange but this multiverse (other universe) stuff has really been more of a phase 4 (plus Endgame) phenomenon.

Based on the language, we are to conceptualize the universe Ta Lo exists in as being more similar to the alternate timeline universes in Endgame, Loki, and What If...? rather than something like Dormammu's Dark Dimension.

In Shang-chi, you learn about his development through context. You first learn see the father & mother character introduced and expanded on by the first fight scene of the movie. ""That guy is a bad-ass and she just beat him up. Oh shit, they just had a kid and that must be Shang-chi."" That already tells the audience that Shang-chi, at the very least, has the potential of being as bad ass as his parents. The bus-fight scene confirms it, and the audience is already on-board. Learning **how** he became a bad-ass was less important, so the movie had more time to focus on **why**. Why is always the more interesting question to explore.",pgw0wk

One thing that marvel has done so well multiple times throughout the MCU is someone find the best rising or unknown stars out there. Like Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were both fairly unknown and are both such genuine guys. Tom Holland is another who just came from nowhere and got cast as one of the biggest roles you can get (in the sense of how well-known and loved Spider-Man is by everyone, including Stan Lee). 

While, yes, they get some star power too, I feel like their ability to cast incredible genuine seeming actors who are passionate marvel nerds just adds to the love of the characters and the dedication to the roles. 

Sarah F something or other is her name, the person in charge of casting, and she’s just incredible.",pgw0wk

I'd rank it the same level as Doctor Strange, honestly. Both had very specific personalities and visual styles, which drew me in. Guardians too, maybe. I'm not sure how I'd compare it to Black Panther, as that was a very different kind of film. And I'm not including Homecoming, because it's not really an origin story.",pgw0wk

BUT that might also be because of my expectations. I EXPECTED to love GOTG but I didn’t expect to like black panther or Shang chi that much.

hbkgquk,"I'm not the person you're responding to, but:

The Mandarin spent 1000 years before he found somebody he loved, and when he did it was so powerful that he was willing to give up his former life and powers. Then his former life comes back to haunt him and he loses everything again, and becomes consumed with the false idea that his wife is imprisoned and he can rescue her. He loses his family in trying to rebuild his family and dies shortly after realising he was tricked into releasing an otherworldly threat.

Shang-Chi watched his mother die, was basically abused and turned into a weapon by his father, apparently killed someone at 14, then left the rest of his family behind. The way they reconnect? His father attacking he and his sister and threatening to burn his mother's village down. His dad basically showed he was entirely willing to kill him, too (punching him into / leaving him in the lake).

Xialing (sorry if I've gotten that wrong) was abandoned by first her father when he couldn't tolerate her presence anymore, then her brother when he left for ten years. As a result she is possibly lost to a life of crime (remains to be seen).

The scene showing the beautiful badass dragon almost getting its soul sucked.

I’m thinking it also points to the Chinese 重男轻女 practice (favouring the son over the daughter, this is especially prominent in Chi/Asian cultures because males help to carry the family name and is traditionally seen as more valuable overall). Then Shang Chi being 长子 (firstborn) further enables this narrative. Just sharing my two cents because I think it’s an added cultural nuance.",pgw0wk

hbokpnx,"I noted Asgard... and it's also why I used the qualifier of ""pure"" when I described the fantasy elements of Shang-Chi as compared to the fantasy elements of Asgard/Thor and Dr.Strange/Wandavision 

With Asgard specifically the point was that, despite the fantasy elements present (Long life of it's people/superpowers/fantastical weapons..etc).  It is something that exists within our world/our universe.  It is a planet that you could theoretically travel in a space ship and visit (prior to it's destruction). 

Ta Lo is outright pure fantasy by comparison.  They frame it as a different dimension, but to get there you have to pass though some magical portal like it's Narnia or something..... it's a fantasy world unlike anything the MCU has presented as of yet.",pgw0wk

Yeah I wished more white people (especially execs and producers) thought like you did, I mean I understand I live in a country that is 60+ % white people but why is the media always 80%+ white? 

And if it's not white it's usually about black people. I have no issues with the latter but it just seems that theres only so much minority media to be allowed and they take most of that quoata.

hbgxze7,"The sister ran away only to return later because she wanted Shang Chi to know what it felt like to be left behind. She literally said those words to his face when he asked about it.

The dad sent assassins to ""kill"" his kids because in his own words, ""They wouldn't be able to kill you if they tried."" Many, many scenes throughout this movie show him using pain to train both his son and his soldiers. He expects his kids to survive, so this is just more of that.

They revealed he was a thousand years old in the opening sequence. It shows him in way ancient times and talks about how he built his army over the ages and toppled empires from time to time.

The Ten Rings army ""switched sides"" because their souls were being torn out by literal demons that their weapons were completely useless against. Had they not done so, every one of them would have suffered a terrible death. Loyalty only goes so far in a situation like that, and it's not like their efforts at that point made things any worse for Wenwu anyway. He had already made it to the door.

Why would Wenwu care about a couple little demons when he still believes his wife is behind there?

Shang Chi literally heard the dudes who killed his mom say that they were doing that because of Wenwu. However, Shang Chi mainly resents his dad because of the cruel way he treated his kids after their mother died. Not as much because of the death itself.

Shang Chi knows that his mother is the only one to have bested Wenwu in a fight. He states this directly, we see this fight, and we see Wenwu kicking everyone else's ass ever. We don't need a scene of 14 year old Shang Chi getting beat up by his dad to reinforce the fact that Wenwu is going to win that fight as-is. We have more than enough evidence to believe that Shang Chi needs to learn to fight like his mom did.

The underwater sequence directly showed air bubbles being directed into Shang Chi's nose.

His aunt isn't speaking in riddles for no reason. That sort of stuff is how martial arts chi-based vaguely mystical combat works in every story ever. It's always about discipline, mastery and understanding of self, reigning in your anger, and stuff like that. You can't just tell someone to be at spiritual peace and expext it to happen,  they need to figure some things out for themselves. And she did far more than speak in riddles, she literally sparred with him and demonstrated how to fight like that.

Ben Kingsley spent an extended amount of time in captivity together with Morris, so it's plenty plausible that they would have learned a few things about communicating with each other in that time.",pgw0wk
hbgv799,"The majority of these ""problems"" are explained in the movie, I don't think you were paying attention my guy.",pgw0wk
hbj1dxu,"> Why did the sister run away only to save him 30 seconds later?

She wanted him to understand how it felt to be abandoned by his sibling. 
 
> Why did dad send assassins to kill his kids if he was going to have a sit down dinner and try to talk with his kids?

He said as much: He was testing to see if they were worthy to rejoin him in The Ten Rings. 
 
> Why are the bad guys using shock weapons at the end cgi fest? The sister stabs a hundred dudes while the bad guys try to lasso people up.

The weapons do more than shock. I'm not sure why you are under the impression that they were just glorified tasers. We see them killing people with them. 
 
> Why did they reveal dad is a 1000year old warlock at the very of of the movie?

They don't. They reveal he's a 1,000 year-old warlord in possession of the Ten Rings at the very BEGINNING of the movie. I mean, he actually explains it all. Can you not read subtitles? 
 
> Why do the members in dad's army follow him? They literally switch sides in seconds.

They follow him because he's a 1,000-year-old warlord who controls the Ten Rings and can kick everyone's ass. They don't ""switch sides"" but agree to stand with the locals because it becomes clear to them that *they themselves* are in danger from what's behind the gate and they're not stupid.
 
> Why did dad not look up and see demons coming out of the cave?

He did. He simply did not care. He was too focused/brainwashed by the evil inside to see it for what it really was. 
 
> Why does shang chi blame his dad for his mom's death? Why does dad blame seven year old shang chi? Doesn't matter anyway because they love each other.

Because the gang that killed his mom was there for revenge for something his dad did before meeting her. His dad blames him because he's lashing out in anguish over the loss of the woman he loves; He doesn't really believe it. He's just saying it out of anger and pain, to make Shang-Chi feel bad (worse). 

> Why does shang chi need to learn wind power to kill his dad? We haven't even seen dad and him fight. I have no idea what the skill level is. Shang chi has murdered everyone with ease.

They say MULTIPLE times that the only person who could ever beat his father was his mother. Shang-Chi had to become the best of both of them to be able to stand up to his father and succeed. 
 
> Why is his aunt speaking in riddles? Why can't she just tell him how to beat his dad? Why does opening his hand give him power?

Not sure what you're getting at there. She didn't speak in riddles (unless you think ""things you don't understand because you didn't pay attention to the dialogue"" is the same thing as ""riddles"".) She told him exactly how his mother's power worked, and guided him in the movements and gestures needed to start unlocking the power he inherited from his mother. 
 
> Why did no one mention the dragon or wake the dragon for the fight? It's literally 30 feet away in the lake?

It's mentioned several times in the entire course of the movie, and it's explained that the great protector acts of its own accord. It can't be wakened to fight for them. It decides when it *needs* to fight, which has only ever been when the evil breaks out of that gate.
 
> Why does shang chi not need to breath underwater? (The editing was awful in this movie) why can he talk to the dragon?

The Protector (the dragon) is giving him breath. You can SEE it rising up from below, into Shang-Chi's nose and mouth. It's magic. And he can communicate with the Protector (basically) because his mother could. It's an inherited power. 
 
> Why can Ben Kingsley talk to the gremlin?

Because Trevor's just strange enough and free-minded enough that he was able to learn what the creature wanted him to learn. Again, these are magical creatures from another dimension.

It is not clear how she could simply watch and be a better fighter, Shang-Chi sure as hell needed that training. It’s also not clear how she would build her own empire so young, and this point is so absurd the movie even comments on it. She gets almost no time to develop her relationship with her father, and her conflict with her brother is wrapped up almost as soon as they reunite. She’s side-lined the entire time and only serves to be an extra body in fights and a teaser in the post credits. She doesn’t even say anything when her dad dies. You can say her relationship with her dad is shitty but that’s not an excuse to cut her out of the core family drama, which this movie effectively does. It replaces a character arc with simply saying “she is badass, and look she’s taking over now!”. It’s lazy writing and she should’ve been given something to do, she’s deadweight to the script currently. It is funny you somehow think it’s sexist that I want a woman who actually has agency in the plot instead of acting as an ornament for the audience to stare at. 

You say it’s obvious, but you are having to invent an entire head cannon not in the film. You don’t have to spoon feed everything to the audience but you do need to actually explain why a trained assassin who succeeds in his first mission would have a change of heart afterwards, which doesn’t happen. Expecting the audience to assume violence = bad is simply lazy storytelling. How exactly does he go from a vengeful successful assassin to a happy go-lucky valet driver? This is a giant gap and as soon as they switch from “I wasnt able to do it” to “I actually did follow through with it, and now I’m going to kill my dad too” his character arc stops making sense.",pgw0wk

But usually ""I don't want any trouble"" guy only works if he's really really reluctant, but also really really cares about something simple that the bad guy keeps messing with, like antique vases or a his neighborhood or his dog.

hbnn9y2,"I really wanted to like his performance too. He does a great job in Kim's convenience- I wish he did more to differentiate this character from Jung. Simu's Shang Chi is more introverted and less flirtatiously whimsical than Jung but sometimes he contradicts this idea in his performance. When he asks Wenwu ""is this what you wanted?"" if feels incorrect for Shang Chi to say, but it feels a lot like something Jung would say. Maybe more the writer's fault that one. I will say though I thought there was adequate chemistry between him and Tony and Michelle but Michelle and Tony no doubt carried those interactions. His chemistry with Awkwafina is there but it's clunky compared to like Natasha and Clint or like T'challa and Shuri.",pgw0wk
hbni4s9,"I think there's significance in that moment. There was only one scene in which I would say Simu Liu was acting well, and that is in the scene where he decides to kill Wenwu. For the rest of the movie he makes decisions that you feel like anybody would make but when he decides that Wenwu deserves death, I can feel that it's a moment of deep anger. His dialogue really sounds like that of a scorned son, with a bit of an undertone of him not really meaning it because of how severely he phrases it. It feels like a decision that Shang Chi the character makes for himself and his family. I don't think Shang Chi was ever going to kill his father, but a part of him was committed to doing so and it differentiates him from other Marvel heros, and that to me was the main function of Shang Chi's decision. The tension functions as intended and releases when Shang Chi choses not to kill him. Wenwu's death afterwards being inevitable isn't necessarily a bad decision; it shows that while he isn't beyond redemption, he is too late for it as a consequence of ignoring the needs of his family for such a long time.",pgw0wk

hl9zt0z,"Kamehameha near the end of the movie, was referenced to the Japanese Anime, Dragon ball. 
Even though it is not specific, if they attempt to do in Chinese culture, at least they could have done it properly, like the fight between the mother and the gang was not Chinese culture but Japanese culture where someone have to pay for what other did. Chinese culture was find the person who did and fight the person, if the person is not alive, then the descendent of that person, mainly males, doesn’t matter whether kid or not, last resort were females. Honestly, even though they tried not to offend others, the choice of the actors are questionable, they could have use an Asian actor from the power ranger, I mean other than the parents, the actors of main character and the sister look much older than what their characters age. If they don’t want to do it specific, at least don’t rely on Chinese culture through out the whole movie. I assumed you are not heavily raised in Chinese culture? Because if you remember all the traditions then you know what I’m talking about. By the people of Chinese descent, I’m mainly referring to Chinese who are heavily influenced by Chinese culture and still practice Chinese traditions or at least know the history and meaning behind it. Not the Chinese who have lost the meaning or understanding of the culture. 

Even if you are Asian American, you still have to know the meaning of history behind the tradition that you practice today instead of just do it without any meaning. And that’s exactly what this movie did. 

Eg, the fight between the mom and gang, Kung fu, adding Japanese reference to replace Chinese and the lantern at the end. All of these without meaning and just added for the sake of showing Asian. 

I can accept a movie that inspired by Chinese culture but a movie that inspired by Chinese culture and continue to use some of the tradition or superficial Kung fu through out the whole movie and use Japanese references to make up for the Asian without any proper references or meaning. Come on, man. That is really offensive. I mean so far, I’m holding my self back from being offended by the movie and only state why it is bad rather than heavily insulting the movie.",pgw0wk

hbrqdp8,"I think it’s one of the best. I absolutely love it, it looks incredible and I also love all of the action scenes.  
You know how they like to play with their characters’ histories in other Marvel films, for example they’ll reveal that Thor is the son of Odin and Loki or Thor and Loki are brothers or something and it doesn’t really carry across, but in Black Panther it really does. The film is a nice, clean reintroduction to the T’Challa’s backstory.  
In the comics, he becomes king after his uncle T’Chaka dies in battle. T’Chaka was murdered and King T’Challa, the first King, is the one who adopts T’Challa into the royal family. He’s also an incredibly brave and powerful fighter who was an incredibly successful ruler. So the film does a good job of reintroducing that and giving us a chance to see the kind of King he could be.  
And it’s a film that, like most of the Marvel films, has a strong message. T’Challa is trying to use his powers to bring about social and economic equality, but it becomes clear that he needs to work with other superheroes. His own people aren’t ready for it. But there’s still good-natured banter, especially between the other black superhero characters. I like the subtle way in which we see the strength of these people working together. That really comes across. And the film is really good at that.  
It’s a great film.

I was enjoying the movie up until then but I really perked up.

I was born in 1984 so action was definitely a genre unto itself growing up but even though as a ""guy"" I was ""supposed"" to like it I kinda just appreciated the artistry and my mind left it alone besides.

I'm sure his soul was a bit more than the average trained ninja schmuck. Makes me think it's not really the size of souls but the amount considering what we were shown.

I don’t hesr anyone praising it ever, save for a few in the Bourne movies. Even that was very polarizing. One reason I can think of is to hide the main actor’s lack of actual screen fighting skills. So I was worried how Shang Chi would turn up seeing Simu Liu is not really an screen fighter. Boy I’m so glad that not only is this competenly shot, it showcased everyone’s skills so well, boldly letting the audience see it in its full glory.

I am fairly certain a speech coach helped him nail the pronunciations and tone of speech to sound more like a native speaker, and he took it and fucking ran with it.

One slight positive of the Pandemic I guess… we’re almost back in sync with the year the movies take place and the year the movie came out IRL

I think all Marvel properties so far to come out post Endgame all have taken place in a handful of months after the events of that movie.  (Based off trailers) The Eternals I think covers a timeline of centuries but the “present day” timeline is still in that “Endgame Aftermath”/less than a year removed from the blip time period of the MCU.  Same for Spider-Man:NWH as (per the trailer) seems to take place immediately after the events of Spider-Man: FFH.  

So depending how far the Hawkeye/Ms.Marvel series as well as Dr.Strange 2/Thor 2 shape out; by next summer IRL timeline of 2022 might only be a year and change out of sync with the MCU timeline (guessing still late 2023/early 2024).  Almost negating that 5 year jump altogether.",pgw0wk

Maybe I'm nitpicking but I felt like I was constantly being taken out of the movie by little things that were out of place. The streamer on the bus who was oddly calm facing near death, the way they narrowly escaped death like a hundred times, (they were a millisecond away from smashing that SUV into a door and getting pancaked, but surely they knew the door would open instantly).. Awkwafina felt forced, idk why she was even there for most of the movie. Way too dangerous of a situation for a normal person. It just felt like the characters nearly died every 20 seconds, so the stakes just disappeared. And I made a joke to my brother the second she got the bow that she'd become a pro and hit some life-saving shot. Yup.

100% agree. I thought the most compelling stuff was Shang Chi going against his dad in a fight. 

Real big bummer when that was sidelined for the floaty CGI dragon fight that ofc will destroy the universe or whatever. Every movie must end in destruction of the world and it must have a big CGI battle over the destruction.

She wasn't anywhere near as powerful as Shang Chi or their dad throughout the movie anyways. I dont get the big deal about the underground fight ring...it's just a fight ring. Plus this is comics. If you're super powered or super good at fighting then you can have your own small organization. Hell, look at Falcon and the Winter Soldier for a less believable example.   

Idk how you missed all of this. We literally see him being beaten, training obsessively to the point he is bleeding, all for a shred of approval. We see him and his sister talk about escaping like it was an abusive household. We see their dad point blank execute someone in front of his 7 year old. We see the talk about Shang Chi needing to accept the darkness inside of him. What more needs to be spelled out? The guy was raised in an abusive environment where he was trained to be a murderer. He ran away after his first kill. The why is pretty fucking obvious. More explanation is just spoon feeding. Plus it was pretty obvious that he lied about not being able to kill the guy.

hbqx728,Because Wong is the Cantonese/Hong Kong spelling and Wang is the Mandarin/mainland Chinese spelling. American comic writers of course wouldn’t know so they use names from both languages.,pgw0wk
hbtgmwv,"No problem. I should warn you that Lust, Caution is rated NC-17 for its depictions of sex so maybe don’t let the kids see that one.",pgw0wk
hm3udr8,Google : 10 rings mandarin.,pgw0wk
hbg3a0j,Well it had a good fight between father and son.  But it’s also a superhero flick that just so happens to have Kung fu.,pgw0wk
he53bjs,"That was all a guise by Killian though. The whole ""Ten Rings"" and ""Mandarin"" in that movie were just appropriations of the name for Killian and his group. That was not the real Ten Rings",pgw0wk
hc0rohj,"i feel like most people dont really go back and watch the first 2 thor movies, so likely a lot of people just forgot her. 

she definitely isnt someone that immediately comes to mind when i think of marvel movies",pgw0wk
hbmhh89,"He claims one of his names or titles is a Khan, so entirely possible.",pgw0wk
hbgvacw,"Yeah, to be fair, I can easily see how you have to work to get that assumption. As a writer, my ear was already on the lookout for it. But it shouldnt be so direct. Him saying the children will come back when he finds the mother... broke my heart. Honestly, if she really was there he would be the father he was again. Its so clear that  that is what he wants. Even giving the final killer to his son. Because he thinks that will help him the way killing those others helped the father. I can't get over how beautifully hidden a character like Wenwu is. I love how the inner workings are kinda revealed through a shade. The story is about Sheng-chi and his sister without a doubt but it is a love story. Wenwu is John Wick but just being taken advantage of by a demon. Heartbreaking.",pgw0wk
hbvbhjn,Yup!,pgw0wk
hbh5jue,China is huge country. Michelle Yeoh is Malay Chinese descent.,pgw0wk
hbia4oj,"Storywise it could be argued that Shang Chi's mother imparted her accent on him. With Wen Wu being a thousand years old, it's not a stretch that he speaks Chinese with a different accent than standard.

Yuen Wah's accent sounded much heavier to me than Michelle Yeoh's or Tony Leung's.",pgw0wk
hbj0ihl,I mean don't they dub over actors in China to get consistent accents for the cast. I didn't know they did that until I watched love 020 and the king's Avatar and realized yang yang sounds completely different in both,pgw0wk
hbn5ifi,Lol yeah I mean they might date it in the future but they definitely did not show they like each other in this movie,pgw0wk
hbnopi4,"I’d say for the purpose of world building and the grand scheme of things, they did enough building up of its origin in this movie to satisfy me.",pgw0wk
hbnkn2v,"Good point, but the point was simply world builing i think, like not everything needs to have some sort of revelancy to the plot. But then again i think it did have some revelency, like it drives home the fact that the village was realñy in a different dimension",pgw0wk
hbnrldu,Bold of you to assume those animals are breathing. I mean one doesn't even have a face.,pgw0wk
hbntabi,[deleted],pgw0wk

hbztu4d,"He wasn't part of the gang, they kidnapped him from prison in the All Hail The King Marvel short.",pgw0wk
hbfi0oy,Comics were steeped in racism. They wanted to use the characters for representation in the MCU.,pgw0wk
hbrpgon,..yes!,pgw0wk
hbn5nw3,">If you want all the marvel movies to follow the characters in the comics like a mime, then you’re always going to set yourself up for disappointment. 

Guilty as charged.  I expected them to have him be less of a loving father.  But, failing that, I would have at least liked to see a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to Chang having foiled Dad's criminal schemes, before the events of the film.  Otherwise, how is anything but an original OC?  It's like with the Snake-eye's movie.  It's not like they changed a few things, but EVERYTHING about how Snake-Eyes acts, and his origins.",pgw0wk
hbro6zw,"
But it's not even really the comics that sold him as a controlling monster. The first 5 minutes of the movie are spent showing and (literally) telling the audience that this guy is a massive asshole who only cares about immortality and power. It's really hard for me personally to sympathize with the guy who runs a shadow organization of assassins",pgw0wk
hbmdtas,Bloodless deaths they showed.,pgw0wk
hbnuwjp,Wot lol?,pgw0wk
hbnv7ra,Nothing in this movie resembled anything from Hong Kong cinema other that Chinese people having roles lol. People comparing this film to Wong Kar Wai or John Woo films is very crazy lol,pgw0wk
hbepr1z,But that thing in the movie had tentacles. I never seen a dragon with tentacles before. It didn't have wings or legs either like Smaug. I always thought Euro dragons are like the ones in GoT which looks nothing like that thing in the movie.,pgw0wk
hbjjbbf,"There is lot of difference in european dragons.

There is western ones who can be either bad or pals as in Arthur stories. Or the three headed dragon from Slavic folklore who can be very neutral character.",pgw0wk

Has to go on NSFW reddit to get any action. Keep doing you buddy! You're doing great",pgw0wk
hby5gz5,"> This Is nothing like the comic character, story, tone, villain literally the ten rings

you can make this argument off literally every single one of these marvel movies to one degree or another. 

> i see so many people just consume corporate crap from a corporation that is straight up evil.

for which i ask you why do you even bother posting here then on reddit? Reddit has zero legs to stand on in regards to their chinese masters either. You can shit all over disney all you want, and rightfully so but as a business they would be stupid to ignore the chinese market",pgw0wk
hbkm1g4,[removed],pgw0wk
hbjfqln,She didn't inherit the family business. The Ten Rings are followers of the Ten Rings and they are now with her brother... of which she lied to about folding the organization. She's using the Ten Rings name without the Ten Rings like Killian.,pgw0wk
hblcsqb,And the actor is Romanian German and is called Romanian in the film. Being white has nothing to do with his character so why should his race matter something that is very i significant im the world anyway matter in the way he is portraying something.,pgw0wk
hbnjpwr,Those rankings are bad.,pgw0wk
hbxeguz,"Careful, don't praise any women or minority performances or r/movincels will rush to tell you your wrong!",pgw0wk
hbnnn4h,What are some other things that stood out to you as odd?,pgw0wk
hbn38k0,"I didn’t watch Iron man 3 so I didn’t know who that character was either. In a way though, my perspective of the character is the same as Shang Chi since we both don’t know him. The brief introduction was enough for me",pgw0wk
hboqkx8,When I was watching Shang Chi i seen the first credit scene and the title came I knew there will be another after 10 minutes of credit. I was watching Suicide Squad couple weeks ago and no one stayed to see the post credit scene.,pgw0wk
hbnik0z,"It didn't seem to me that Shang Chi chose not to kill him so much as stop fighting to hopefully reason with him one last time, but I do see your point that Wenwu uses his last moments to attempt something of a means of mending his relationship by passing on the rings to Shang Chi",pgw0wk
hbtkvk5,r/whoosh,pgw0wk
hc4fpaw,idk then,pgw0wk
hc5ebju,Yes,pgw0wk
hca54k8,Agree they glossed over it. But he definitely killed him. And he definitely regretted it. And he knew he could never do it again.,pgw0wk
hcczsmd,">wouldn't be the reason for him to just drop all his trianing and just peace out.   

The training was nothing positive dude. He was physically and emotionally abused for 7 years up to that point. His dad killed all those gangster right in front of his 7 year old and got a 7 year old to agree to revenge murder. Then he stood there impassive as his kid was beaten or punched wood until he bled, all for a shred of approval. His dad blamed Shaun for the mom's death and Shaun blamed the dad. You think Shaun wanted to go back and continue working for the 10 Rings when the 10 Rings is why his mom died?   

People being confused on this is exactly why so many movies spoonfeed the viewer",pgw0wk
hcm4vax,"It would've definitely been too on the nose, but I was half expecting the reveal to Katy to be ""and the man I killed was your grandfather.""",pgw0wk
hcrgth4,It was pretty heavily implied.  I certainly wish they showed it on screen instead of having him just sit and talk about it.,pgw0wk
hktmffs,I’m sure that’s the logic Wong and Wenwu had when they dragged her along 🤣🤣. Nice logic.,pgw0wk
hta8tq5,"The choreography was good, but not outstanding when compared to the best stuff of the Hong Kong era (e.g. the undead fight in 'Dead and the Deadly' as a random example). There just isn't that sense of mayhem they used to be so good at, where now it feels like a pre-planned dance (even if it always was even in ""the good old days"" and they just hid it better).

Also, it's not about ""the actor did it themselves"", I don't care about that. It's that *somebody* did it. CGI often means nobody did anything; better to use it to add something really dangerous to a stunt still performed than just CG the whole scene/actor.",pgw0wk
hbzetvh,"I agree with this, although imo it worked for this film. He needs a love interest next movie, but I think the creators and audience are split on whether Katy and Shang should be just friends or not",pgw0wk
hc8xlf5,I felt the same way about Shang Chi's sister. She also served no functional role in the story. Other than I guess to demonstrate her father's sexism.,pgw0wk
hcguc6g,"Still more than just ok.

The bar has just been set ridiculously high for MCU.",pgw0wk
hbhfeho,"The only Marvel origin stories I can think of that are any different are ones like Iron Man that predate the quirky sidekick they give everyone now, which is kind of my problem. Despite how much I love MCU movies, every single one now feels like a carbon copy of elements that came before in other ones. I don’t think there’s been a Marvel movie that has done something different in some time. They don’t necessarily have to, I enjoyed Black Widow and it’s not like that was anything new. I think something just clicked with me during this one and it was like the last straw in my mind lol. Happy others are enjoying it though. I’ll certainly be there for Eternals in two months hoping it’s good.",pgw0wk
hlaavma,"I see the move Shang Chi did with those rings at the end as more of a Tai Chi ball movement. Katy later made a pop cultural reference calling it kamehameha, which I thought was totally appropriate and natural for a character of her age to make. It's a Chinese super hero movie made to appeal to general Asian American populations. If you want to be offended by mixing different east Asian cultures, that's your prerogative but you don't speak for all Chinese.

I agree 100% with your criticism of superficial references to Chinese cultural concepts without applying them in a meaningful way, so it can look like they are just going through the motion. But I'm not bothered by it. Offensive would be casting white people in Chinese character roles, which is what they did 30-40 years ago, I just watched the original Dune... I think overall this is a step in the right direction. There's room for improvement for sure.

Out of curiosity, how do you feel about Avatar the last Airbender TV show? It mixes all kinds Asian cultures, Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, etc, but I think it's one of the best piece of Asian culture inspired entertainment made for western audience. Is your main issue just with them calling Shang Chi Chinese? Had they made up a fictional Asian country like they did with Wakanda, would you be fine then?",pgw0wk
hc64mhk,She also drives in two other scenes so not really sure what else you want. Her flying a dragon would make even less sense than picking up a bow.,pgw0wk
hbrlbju,"Well, yeah.  I actually posted, a month ago about my doing the same to ""Black Widow"", and ""Gawain and the Green Knight"".  And have done so, without posting about it to other films.",pgw0wk
hbrg7bd,"Uh?  Did you miss the part where I said I didn't pay to get into it?  Sure, I saw the film, but as far as the people who count are concerned, I never saw it.  That's the whole point of my actions.  But are you seeing some value in actually, factually not seeing it?  If so, I disagree.  I don't think I could critique this film without seeing it.  And I don't see future films getting better without criticism.  

Are you meaning this in some spiritual sense?  You'll have to elaborate, if you want me to take your advice.",pgw0wk

hcupbx9,"I agree, but I think she already went through her ""closure"" arc off-screen. Like Shang didn't really do anything with his life after he ran away because it seems like he was still stuck *needing* closure. She was able to make a positive decision for herself without closure where Shang waffled until he couldn't anymore.",pgw0wk

hbh5f80,"I didnt much like Black Widow, it felt pointless, as you sort of touched on. I also felt like it was predictable and boring. Shang Chi was leaps and bounds better than Black Widow, it took a few cool risks, and truly did have some great comedic moments! I think for an origin movie for a character nobody really knows or cares about, marvel did a good job! Perhaps after you see it you will come back here and report your thoughts on it, would be curious to know if you end up liking it! Cheers mate!",pgw0wk

Sorry - definitely for attention.",pgw0wk
hbw3jj5,"Wow the cast that includes, Tony Leung, one of the most acclaimed actors like, ever? 

Awkwafina, another Chinese American actress who grew up in NYC?

Michelle Yeoh, a Malaysian actress who's also pretty acclaimed and has been in a bunch of big stuff like Crazy Rich Asians and Memoirs of a Geisha? 

Ben Kingsley, a British actor. Benedict Wong who's been in like, 3 marvel movies now? And Ronny Chieng who's a comedian who's mostly been in American movies and TV shows? 

Fala Chen has been in mostly Chinese movies but that's also one person out of a large cast.

What I can say is that Asian grandmas really want great grandchildren, and when it comes to granddaughters they want to see them marry.

Being the lead a MCU movie is enough to completely change the direction of a person's life but there will be some Black Panther/Chadwick Boseman parallels of representation and why this role is even bigger than most Marvel roles. You might have 2 billion+ South East Asians massively looking up to you.

Because he is somewhat grounded and a fan himself, it really is going to be a whirlwind.

Taken at face value to the character, his life really was this insane circus even as a child. The circus isn't entirely new to Shang Chi, but it will be to Simu Liu.",pgw0wk

hnng8et,"Yes, it's a thing. There is a cultural difference between Americans and (in general) Asian cultures. At least with the Chinese culture I know of (there are numerous), it is considered impolite to brag or praise yourself. This translates to not praising or bragging about your children who are considered extensions of your own flesh.  


This goes so far as to not just not praise children publicly, but also privately.  


Despite this impoliteness, Asian parents do it all the time indirectly by bluntly telling their friends and family about SAT scores, achievements, and college admissions. This might be tempered with false humility to keep it polite.  


It's a strange cultural dance, but your ability to do this well is a sign of your social standing. If you are too blunt about your bragging, it shows that you are uneducated and uncultured.  


Also, education often equates to social standing and smarts which are highly valued in Chinese culture(s).   


As a kid, I found this all very disingenuous, appalling, and gauche. I came to understand it a little better after I got older. I'm still not a fan though. But that's what being first generation is about--- your own social sensibilities are shaped by the new country, but your parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents have social sensibilities shaped by the old country.

hbg47rp,"how is that not the same thing as a variant though? Its the same person in two different 'realities', one being Mark Ruffalo's and the other Norton's. So the Ruffalo Abomination would have done the same stuff as the Norton one, except this Ruffalo Abom did all that stuff in the MCU, which is Ruffalos world, so it was Ruffalo who did all the same events (presumably without deviance) with Abom in the MCU.

Maybe we're in disagreement on the term ""variant""? I think you mistook that I was saying one is the original and one is a different version, but I meant ""variant"" in that every single character of the same name is a variant. 

So Ruffalo himself is a variant - the MCU variant that is. variant is just saying 'this universes version'. So this Abom has always lived in the MCU but likely did the Norton events but against Ruffalo, meanwhile the Norton universe is a different reality.

I think the confusion is from (Loki show ending spoilers) >!in Loki, 'variants' are when they 'deviate from the 1 timeline', but now that the timeline has broken!< and What If confirms that there are infinite multiverses, every realities version of a character is a ""variant"", even though theyre the 'destined' path for their own respective universes.",pgw0wk

He doesn't have a particularly high nose bridge, his face is quite square, his eyes aren't very big, he's not very fair, he has monolids - in order words, because he looks like most Chinese people, he gets labelled average and therefore, not handsome.

Lucy Liu got the same treatment. Most people in China do not understand why she's considered beautiful in America because she looks so ""average"". All these touted beautiful people in Chinese entertainment have gone under the knife in order to get the desired features.",pgw0wk

hce9cx5,"I kind of feel like the whole thing with Katy is she has the potential to be  bad ass.  She's just afraid to find out she's NOT bad ass so she bails before she reaches the point.

They reference it with the friend (who looks quite successful) who basically says Katy (and Shawn) are two of the most talented people she knows.  Katy also admits later that whenever she starts to get good at things she quits which kind of leads me to believe she can be pretty damn good at a lot of things.  I think if they delved into that a bit more it wouldn't have been so... abrupt.  

I totally agree with the criticism that it felt off that Katy suddenly was so good at it.  I think this would've been handled much better if they had replaced the scene where the lady drops the arrows with a scene of them walking by the archery training range and Katy picks up a bow and says ""hey that's looks fun, can I try?"".  She picks it up, shoots with bad form, and doesn't hit the bullseye but hits the target, then she turns around the Shang-Chi with the typical Awkwafina swagger ""look at that! First try!""  

Guang Bo sees and tells Shang-Chi disapprovingly ""your friend's form is terrible, she needs more practice"" and then Shang-Chi just goes ""oh she's just screwing around, I don't think she's ever touched a bow before"".  Then she shoots again (with bad form) and hits the target again, this time slightly better.  Cuts to Guang Bo being surprised before putting the bow down and then pushing Shang-Chi to continue on to where they need to go.  Then as they're leaving Guang Bo stops her and tells Shang-Chi to go on without her. 

I could totally see Katy picking up a bow to play with and it also establishes she's pretty good at things and why they trained her to shoot.  Also I feel like the scene where she does shoot the dragon would've been better if we had seen an arrow fly by, then another arrow fly by, then the hit.

Not sure if that'd ruin the pacing but I dunno I think that'd just make more sense.",pgw0wk
hbz7mep,"I think they just didn’t force it, and it makes sense. Wenwu has been around earth for thousands of years, Guangbo, Michelle and mom are from a different dimension so it can be anything.

If shang chi and his sister grew up on the ten rings compound which is helicopter distance from Macau, I’m going to assume (and I’m probably wrong) that they’re somewhere in guangdong, in which their own mainland accents make sense as well.

So Ta Lo's ""universe"" is just a parallel one with an alternate China that has all the mythological creatures.

The only reason they can use airbending or water bending is because the dragon can bless them with those gifts, not because the laws of the universe are just that different.",pgw0wk

Same goes for any of the more VFX-heavy parts of tFatWS. I'd say WandaVision did better at looking movie tier, but that might be because it had fewer VFX-heavy portions and was made to look like a cheap enough sitcom for half the season. 

Admittedly, some of the lacking quality might be due to COVID-related delays, so maybe they'll improve in the future, but while the Disney+ MCU stuff definitely has great budgets and relatively good CGI, it is absolutely realistic that they would want to keep the Hulk on-screen time lower for budgetary reasons.",pgw0wk

hbmfxz3,"I like the way this played out though because Shang throwing the rings down showed us the audience that he decided he didn’t actually want to be that person that his dad taught him to be (the blood for blood person). He set out planning to kill his dad, he had him where he needed to defeat him, but he realized that’s not who he is. He also realized that his dad wasn’t evil, he felt sadness for his dad and saw that his dad did have love in him (his aunt even said before that he is who he is from both of his parents, the good and the bad).

By Shang throwing the rings back down and not killing his dad, we learn that Shang doesn’t want to kill his dad (whereas if we would have just had the big fight, we wouldn’t have seen that arc). The way the dad dove to save Shang, you could see it in the actors eyes and emotions that he did it out of instinct and love, he knew in that moment he couldn’t let his son be taken.

And the fight scenes we DID get with the dad and the son were incredibly well-done in my opinion. A lot of references both to Shang’s training, but then also references to the first time that the dad fought the mom.",pgw0wk

It kind of highlights how poorly characterized the character is across all his appearances.  The writing room clearly wasn’t asian because Danny comes off as a frat bro who took a summer backpacking in Asia and made it his entire personality.  Asians take their shoes off indoors because they don’t want to get their homes dirty.  Barbershop floors are filthy and covered in hair it makes no sense to go barefoot.  Looking at that and thinking “oh asians take their shoes off inside no matter what” is so dumb i can’t believe they made it a part of the show.",pgw0wk

IMO that's why I keep watching Marvel.  The way I see it, the films and shows have taken a media property and treated it like some directors treat zombies: Sure there are zombies in the movie, but it's not actually ABOUT the zombies.  Hulk is sort of like a body horror flick about science going too far, Thor's a coming of age journey for Point Break to learn how to be an adult, Winter Soldier is a spy movie, Guardians is a prison break, Volume 2 is about the difference between family and blood, Ultron is about the philosophical balance between liberty and safety, Ant-man's a heist movie and this was a kung fu movie.

hboga66,"Mostly the mid-credits scene. Why Carol had long hair and why Bruce was back in human form. But it’s the fact that Abomination had fins that really stands out to me more. Carol could’ve grew her hair out again, and Bruce could found some way to return back to human form, but why was Abomination essentially completely different.

Another thing that didn’t sit right with me was the lack of inclusion of Dr Strange. There’s an Avenger’s meeting with Carol and Bruce yet Strange is nowhere to be seen but with Wong taking point on their end. It seemed odd to me. Surely if he were around he would’ve wanted to have been at that meeting too.

However, I’m more inclined to now think that Shang-Chi actually takes place during the five year gap after the snap. We know the snap is mentioned as their friend talks about living in a world where half the population can disappear, but this could be reference to both everyone still missing as much as it could be since they’ve all returned. It would explain Carol’s hair, Bruce’s human form, and the lack of Dr Strange.

Although, after watching the trailer for No Way Home I’m convinced by the rumours that the Dr Strange we see in that movie won’t be the same one we’ve watched throughout the MCU so far. Possibly it’s someone in disguise or a variant, as from what we’ve seen of his character so far, I’m not so sure the Dr Strange we know would use such a spell that could alter reality just so that everyone would forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Especially after being told by Wong not to do so.

But again, this could also lend to both Shang-Chi and No Way Home not being set in the sacred timeline we’ve seen so far. Maybe Wong took point with the meeting about the rings because Dr Strange in their timeline isn’t all that trustworthy, as seen in the Spider-Man trailer.

However let’s say they are based in the sacred timeline, the things I’ve already mentioned about Carol and Bruce and Abomination don’t quite lineup with what we know already. So even if it is based in the timeline we know, something is off. 

And with the inclusion of What If…? running right now, Marvel are eluding to the fact that everything we know and have seen so far could be changed in an instant. There’s no coincidences in the MCU.",pgw0wk

Just that I can’t accept the how loosely they apply the culture without any meaning, I can accept Kamehameha but not the challenge between woman and gang as well as lantern and Kung fu. But you got to remember, if we go by time line, the main character at the time of the fight between the mom and the gang was in btw the 1980s-2000s and most likely in Hong Kong or China.

Think if Shang Chi never gets the rings. The whole movie sort of leads up to that and then all of a sudden he picks up a bow and arrow and saves the day. 

Iron man spends the whole movie building Iron man he then uses it to save the day at the end. 

Awkwafina love for driving doesnt lead to anything besides her just driving some times. Why does she then all of a sudden pick up a bow and arrow? Why not something consistent with her skill?

hbiwis7,"For what it's worth, I think we're both right. 

Foremost, I think you're right, because it is a PG movie, and they would take that certification into account when planning something like a death scene. So her looking peaceful and serene is specifically so they could stick to PG. 

Where I think I am right, is more from a literary mechanism point of view. The reason my theory works so well regarding a historical scene, told from the memory of Shang-Chi, is that provides a means within the narrative for her to look peaceful and serene. 

When you're able to keep your artistic choices within the boundaries of the narrative, the story itself is usually stronger for it. 

Shang-Chi is the character we're following now, and he's taking us on a journey to his memories and experiences. In those memories, we learn about how his mother died, and what she shared with him in those final moments, because these things are formative to the events of this moment in the present. 

Now, in the beginning of the film, when we saw the history of the Ten Rings, that was a true flashback. I would consider those to be historical events which happened largely as shown. 

The difference between the two is that in the beginning, it's not his father teaching us about the rings. He's not the focus character. We have a kind of 3rd person omniscient point of view, and we're looking at history. 

But when we follow Shang-Chi to key memories which inform the present, as our focus character, unless it's indicated otherwise, I would consider those moments to be viewed through the lens of Shang-Chi as a character. 

This is just my analysis of the scenes and the storytelling though. I'm not trying to tell you that you're wrong, because you aren't.",pgw0wk

hbhix84,"I gave the correct translation above.  


Nowhere in the original Chinese does it imply that it's referring the to the smallest individual units of either salt or rice.  


The phrase has [frequently been translated into English before](https://www.google.com/search?q=I%27ve+eaten+more+salt&client=opera-gx&sxsrf=AOaemvLB2UlTNhF_-hT_dty-3VszUj-qUw%3A1630697532569&ei=PHgyYdCfItuT0PEP-qWF6Ag&oq=I%27ve+eaten+more+salt&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECc6BQgAEIAEOgYIABAWEB5KBAhBGAFQ3i1Y0kZgsUpoAXAAeAGAAbgCiAHqD5IBCDEwLjcuMC4xmAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjQrajZxePyAhXbCTQIHfpSAY0Q4dUDCA0&uact=5), and I've yet to see a single translation include unit words like 'grains'.   


Lastly, it just wouldn't make sense on a idiomatic level. If your entire point is that you've done more of something than someone, you wouldn't pick something that is naturally consumed in higher unit quantities to back you up. In a single cup of *uncooked* rice you typically max out at 10,000 grains of rice. Since 1 cup uncooked rice typically yields 3 cups cooked rice, we can estimate 1 cup of cooked rice maxes out at 3,500 grains of rice.

How many grains of salt do you think are in a pinch? Or a teaspoon? I assure you the numbers are at the very least comparable, and almost certainly larger. Why pick something that would give the person on the receiving end room to say, ""hey now, are we even sure the average person doesn't already eat more grains of salt than grains of rice?"" Yes, rice is *the* dietary staple for most Asian cultures, but that's almost besides the point. It's an idiom, it's meant to be leverage exaggeration to make its point crystal clear. It makes far more sense that the phrase is meant **volumetrically** as opposed to per-unit.

Which one sounds better to you: ""I've walked further than you've ridden"" or ""I've walked more steps than you've ridden miles?""",pgw0wk
hbjvfxh,"We still don't eat more grains of rice than grains of salt though. A cup of uncooked rice is around 10,000 grains and a teaspoon of salt is around 200,000 grains.

Your translation is wrong, the idiom only makes sense when comparing volume, not number of grains.",pgw0wk
hbh8m1j,Fair point,pgw0wk
hbjeg1h,"I thought the main idea was that pound for pound, a person consumes way more rice in a year than salt. So in order to get up to an amount of salt consumed equivalent to another person's amount of rice consumed, you need to have lived much longer than the other person.",pgw0wk

Speaking/listening is very different. A lot of people can speak or understand one, but not the other without proper education or exposure. Mandarin has 4 tones, and Cantonese has like 8 or 9. If I only spoke one my entire lifetime w/o exposure or learning the other, I would not understand.

Edit: Exposure meaning being around people who speak it I guess? My family is both from Hong Kong and mainland China, so I had exposure to both and can speak/understand both. My family in Hong Kong can understand Mandarin due to frequent exposure, but speak it with an accent. My friends from Taiwan who did not have exposure to Cantonese can't understand it one bit.",pgw0wk

It's typically used as an insult, in that the person labeled as an ""ABC"" is lesser than their motherland counterpart. This is due to the tendency of those born in America to lose touch with their ethnic roots due to assimilation (e.g. loss of language, customs, religion).

Like any insult, ABC can also be used in good humor given the appropriate social dynamic. Kind of like calling your good friend an asshole.

It's range of use in the Asian American community is very wide and cross cultural, as the many ethnic groups whom belong to this community understand the meaning and context. 

In the movie Jon Jon expressed to Katy his recognition of her as an ABC, mocked her, and stated he could speak English with just that single line of dialogue.",pgw0wk

htbpprm,"I absolutely agree that the fight scenes a very much superior in this over most other MCU movies. I wasn't having a go at you, rather just saying that I was surprised and a bit sad to see so many general moviegoers talking like this film had the greatest fight scenes ever put on film when you and I know there are lot better in older movies. That certainly doesn't mean it's not good to see decent action in a modern movie for once! Like you say, I think a *huge* part of the problem with modern movies is editing, though; often you see some great fight scene that clearly looked good on the day but that gets chopped to pieces with blurry quick cuts. Many directors seem to think they are clever to do long takes on occasion, but there's a middle ground of just pulling your camera back a bit and letting us see an action scene play out, especially when you have great performers.

I think I tend to grumble a bit too much because I'm an old bastard and worry that a lot of younger folks would never bother watching ""ancient"" subtitled foreign movies from the 70s, 80s or 90s and so may never no what truly incredible stuff we got back then that - as you say - we may never see again.",pgw0wk

hlbakk2,"Yeah I get you. I'm just not as offended or as surprised by this movie, because I was aware going in that it was mainly made by Chinese Americans for Americans. The level of nuance with regard to cultural elements is well within my expectation. That one glimpse of into modern day Chinese American family dynamic through Katy's family breakfast scene was on point and genuine to me.

The biggest disappointment for me is the fact that Wenwu had lived for a thousand years but his mannerism and character is basically modern. They could have really played up that aspect and made it into a point of contention between him and his children, that there's this generational gulf between them due to huge difference in value that's irreconcilable. Instead, he's just another warlord gunning for power and world domination and the difference is the same old ""my dad kill people and I wasn't OK with that and ran away, but I made up my mind now to kill him, to stop him from killing more people"". The only moment him being that old was made relevant was when he chided the old man for talking disrespectfully (I wonder if Tony Leung improved that dialog). It's just a big lost opportunity.

Honestly if I have to guess, this is as ""Chinese"" as we are going to get out of MCU. Now that Shang-Chi has been introduced into the current Avengers roster, I fully expect his mythical Chinese background on his mother's side be relegated to the sidelines. I won't be surprised if they made the ten rings cosmic/alien in origin and the whole secret Chinese village guarding dark portal to evil spiritual realm storyline never to be heard from again.",pgw0wk

It's not consistent with her skill that's what I've been saying. I know how to drive but I can't ride a horse much less a dragon.

You expect this dragon to stop flying, get low on the ground and wait for this random person it doesn't know to slowly climb up it (because she's not a ninja like the others)? And then she's in the air...then what? She doesn't have any weapons because you said her having a bow makes no sense. So what is the point of her being on this dragon?

But he said he ate more salt than the other guy's rice. So he refering to length of life too because it's about having experienced a lot.  Bitter experience is just adding more weight to him saying the other guy is an inexperienced ""kid"". Sweet summer child. Dumb kid that doesn't know enough to say anything.  Etc. Whenever an adult puts down a junior with their age,  lived experience tends to also correspond with it because it's always ""you can't speak,  I know more than you.""

I always dislike when superheroes are each dealing with COSMIC THREATS TO HUMANITY but each has a totally different threat only suited to that hero's powers and this shit is happening all the time with 0 reference to each other.

This is part of what made the first 3 phases of Marvel work so well. You can see the ripples of each film across the others.

So far between WandaVision and Shang-Chi... These are some pretty big threats. Like... I'd say Ultron-level things going on. The mega soul sucker would be a tough one to defeat even by the Avengers.

I feel like Dr. Strange and Thor are franchises that get to explore this slightly sub-Thanos threat level... But if Eternals, Spider-man, Multiverse of Madness, etc. all delve into these extinction-level or reality-shattering events... It gets into a kind of superhero fatigue.

They can't be saving the universe ALL the time. It should be local-level threats most of the time and then Ultrons, Dormammus, Thanoses once in a blue moon. 

I would appreciate if they tied the Shang-Chi creatures to the Eternals. It sucks if they balloon out into too many unrelated things.

Imagine if between early MCU movies, the bad guys were collecting some unrelated relics of immense power instead of the infinity stones.

The fact that infinity stones are this throughline between films is what made everything work so well. If they're just unrelated relics, Infinity War would've been so weak and MCU movies would just feel like ""villain of the week"" shit.",pgw0wk
