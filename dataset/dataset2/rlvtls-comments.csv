hpthwyz,"The final villain twist was absolutely nonsensical. How was >!Morton!< able to sneak off for presumably days or even weeks on end to do his evil villain meetings. Why is the ""flock"" following him? Why do they care abour scottish independence.

~~The Kingsman agency doesn't exist yet, but they already have a spy network set up for some reason?~~

Overall it felt way too unfocused and all over the place, first 30-40 minutes is just jumping through events and plot points, then the russian quest, then the 1917-like detour... it was just so weird.",rlvtls
hpzqnv0,The Rasputin scenes were hilarious. The funny thing is Rasputin's actual death was way more ridiculous than what they came up with in this movie.,rlvtls
hq2ygz3,"From a quick browse of this thread, my opinion will be controversial, but I enjoyed it. Very different to the first two and quite glib and (successful or not at least attempting to be) poignant at times. I can see how this ultimately evolved in to the tongue in cheek Eggsy era. It felt like it created the necessary Monarchs losing their next of kin sadness to precipitate Kingsman’s founding. Also nice to see an actual effectual death in a universe where no one dies. It had its flaws and I will be honest I have a massive Gemma Arterton crush, but I can see what they were trying to achieve here.",rlvtls
hqgqqi6,That no man's land scene was absolutely the highlight for me due to its suspenful structure and sheer brutality of it all like I did not expect the film to go that dark. Also the way Conrad died because of a misunderstanding just felt so insanely cruel and unexpected but it did serve well with showing how random and heart breaking war can be to anyone really. Great stuff 👏,rlvtls

Spoiler >!At its heart, this is an origin story about a fictional spy agency that blames WWI and 20 million deaths on an embittered Scottish cashmere farmer. But this mysterious man, who is seen only in shadows until a big reveal at the end, is played like an angrier and more sadistic but no less ridiculous Fat Bastard!<",rlvtls
hpszl6f,"Honestly if you turn your brain off and get ready for a popcorn flick—which is what I expect from Kingsman—it was quite enjoyable. I kind of love it when movies set around a certain historical event go so stupidly out of left field.

I mean this movie blames the entirety of WWI (and to an extent WWII) on a Scottish farmer wanting revenge on England. I feel like that alone should tell everyone that this movie is meant to be taken lighter than the feather they keep throwing about.

That being said, I agree with all the criticisms of this movie and would not recommend it to people lol


Edit: oh and I really liked the Rasputin ballet-fighting scene. That kind of ridiculousness gave me the Kingsman-ness I wanted from the film.",rlvtls

hpzq0vo,"While I don’t think the twist with Morton was that great, I will say the marketing and film did a great job at having me really believe that Aaron Taylor Johnson was the big bad, from having him in **zero** marketing, the big bad being hidden in shadows, and the voice in the trailers and in the movie until the reveal, sounding like ATJ doing a thick Scottish accent **plus** his actual character showing up and being Scottish. 

Very early on it was clear Morton was a baddie, but wasn’t expecting him to be the actual main villain, so yea. 

Anyways I enjoyed it for what it was. Rasputin was great and I thought all of the good guys were genuinely great. Loved Shola, Polly, and Orlando. No Man’s Land was brutal with that fight scene in the night being **wild** and I was not expecting Conrad to go out like that. Legit caught me by surprise.",rlvtls

hpiwm42,"The son’s war adventure and death totally stunted the movie and served little purpose to the narrative. It derailed it from a fun action flick to this random conflict with little weight. The dad’s bummed for like 2 mins and then it tries to go back to the fun action romp tone.

Just a weird choice in direction.",rlvtls
hq5x55t,I was really impressed by the no man's land scene. The setup of the knives only fight was interesting. But the aftermath of that where the kid breaks down after his first experience with actual fighting was surprising to see in a movie like this.,rlvtls
hpqvzad,"The 5/10 are spot on. A lot of weird writing choices and general tone shifts make the film hard to really enjoy, but the saving grace remains spectacular actors (Charles Dance actually making me feel something like sadness for fucking Kitchener of all people, surprised even me) and fun action sequences. The Rasputin scenes were crazy and amazing and probably the most ""Kingsmen"" part of the entire film. The WWI stuff was pretty standard fare but the fight in No Man's Land was spectacular in its brutality. Just a lot of wasted potential in the story and setting. A Kingsmen film set in the 1920s with more weird gadgetry that actually showed us a budding ""spy agency"" with similar characters would have been more enjoyable than a lot of the plot dragassery of this.

On the note of Conrad, I think a lot of people will dislike the character, which is fair, but I appreciate that his entire character is one giant trope destruction. The trope is that arrogant young rich English kid insists he is prepared for war (very common in actual England at the time), goes to war, and has the realization that actually all the old people were right and war is hell and he therefore becomes a much better man for it. The character is played straight to the trope right up until, well, war is hell, and he gets shot in the face by his own side after amazing heroics. Perfect. Excellent takedown of that. Sometimes there is no ""I am wiser now"" arc because the world doesn't work that way. Sometimes you just die in a stupid, pointless manner, which essentially encapsulates so much of WWI. All that said, not sure a wild action romp was really the place to deliver that message but here we are.",rlvtls
hpitvh6,"Not quite what I would've expected for an ""origin story"" of how the Kingsman agency came to be. Not that I would've wanted a bunch of forced wink-wink, nudge-nudge references (the codenames covered that anyway.) 

The tone and pacing was a bit all over the place with them trying to recreate this silly, fictionalized account of WWI. So much time is spent on exposition of how this country interacts with that country and this person's relationship with that person and how it ALSO affects the war. Don't get me wrong, in theory that stuff is all really interesting and I wouldn't mind watching a movie about it. But in Kingsman? It just felt a bit out of place and like they were trying to do too much all at once; something that would require a 3 hour epic to properly do it justice, not your standard silly action flick. That all said though, I respect them for trying something different, especially with the more unique time setting.

My biggest disappointment was easily the villain, all that build-up for such a big letdown. Personally, I would've really preferred if Rasputin was the main baddie and that's kind of the vibe I got from the trailers buuuut I guess that's marketing for you. He was just so much more captivating and more of an interesting character as opposed to... angry Scottish man. Sure, they would've had to rewrite the story to make it work but it's not like they were going for 100% accuracy anyways. If anything I was expecting Ras to show up at the very end as a fun reference to how he supposedly didn't die even after being shot, stabbed, poisoned, etc.

They've still yet to recapture the real charm of the original film, it's easily the strongest of the three. This one was still fun but I'm hoping they manage to raise the bar a little next time.",rlvtls
hpiqfqb,"Loved the first one, didn't care for the 2nd, how does this one fit in?",rlvtls
hprlu4c,"The whole movie should have been the newly formed Kingsman vs Rasputin. The main characters son dies in the great war which pushes him to form the Kingsman. He starts killing the people who pushed to start the war and Rasputin was the organizer of it all for name whatever reason you want.

The first attempt they poison him. Call it job done, mission over. They see news he's still alive and find him again and stab him and call it job done, mission over. They see he's alive still so they track him down, big big fight and they drown him in a river and as they are leaving Gemma Arterton shoots him in the head for good measure (or as he's rising out of the water). Call it mission done, job over. Make the Kingsman service official, roll credits",rlvtls
hpiuavw,"How did people feel about Conrad? I really didn’t care for his character, and his death was ridiculous to me. He fireman carries a man across across a dead man’s zone under heavy fire, gets hit with a fucking mortar, but has the presence of mind and feels it necessary to lie about his identity?",rlvtls

hpij0mq,"Decent movie, didn’t feel like a Kingsman movie though. Where was the humor?

Didn’t understand why it turned into 1917 for the middle of the movie

Didn’t expect to see Rasputin licking Ralph Fiennes

I thought the villain guy was going to be Mike Meyers for sure based off his voice

6/10",rlvtls
hpii3mo,"Weird movie. I feel like if you can't balance the comedy, the emotion, the violence, the class, and the silliness like the first one you just end up with a tonal gumbo. This movie goes like thirty minutes with barely a giggle then it's time to laugh about how bisexual Rasputin is. 

I'll never complain about more Ralph Fiennes. He had to carry the weight of this movie and he was doing a fine job, as was the rest of the cast. The movie was kind of marketed on the Rasputin scene and that was fun, but short lived. The script overall is just so all over the place. 

I will say, the villain reveal was awful. It felt like it kept the actor from really putting forth a performance because they used so many shadow tricks and ADR to hide his identity, and then when it's revealed he's basically nobody. Like who even remembered that guy's presence? It's a damn shame because he was chewing the hell out of that accent and could have been a fun performance. 

It's fun that Vaughn did some historical fiction and it's not a bad movie per se. It just depends on what you want out of it. It's not terribly funny, but it has some fun action. It's not the heaviest movie of the year but it may surprise you with some emotion. But I'd imagine anyone looking for a glimpse of what made Kingsmen good will be disappointed. I kept waiting for them to assemble a team or make some gadgets but the closest we got to a climax was a sword fight in a goat shed. 

5/10.

hrbg2bp,"I thought killing Conrad was a daring and great choice. Real gut punch.

A lot of the historical stuff was weird though, like it reminded me of FDR American bad ass.

The Hitler mid credits scene didn't need to happen.",rlvtls
hptcnol,"I just got out of the theater, and I thought this movie was fine, but not exceptional. The acting and action were great, but the story structure seemed strange to me. The story doesn't seem to have a 3-act structure, nor doesn't it have a traditional hero's journey arc. Now that I think about it, this might be the first origin-story I've ever seen that doesn't have a hero's journey arc. 

The plot had some pacing problems, and the idea of WW1 being masterminded by a Scotsman upset with the English was silly. The action was very well choreographed though, the special effects were good, and the actors all gave good performances, so overall I enjoyed it. 

I saw the new matrix film last weekend, and this was certainly better than that.",rlvtls
hpj4bcw,"I thought it was alright. I was mostly entertained. I’ll never feel the need to watch it again tho. 6/10 

The whole sequence with Conrad in the war seemed like it was ripped out of another, much better movie, also damn, that one dude was quick with the trigger finger when he thought he was a traitor. 

I honestly had no desire to see this movie but had nothing better to do tonight and I have A-List. I’ve seen the trailers for 2 years now and was burnt out on it but it was better than I thought it would be. 

Obv the best part was Rasputin, so it was a bit odd to kill off the best character of the movie halfway through. 

I didn’t realize Matthew Goode was in this and playing Morton so i didn’t see the reveal coming. Though I just had my brain turned off by then. 

It felt like there was a much better WW1 movie buried in there that we just got a glimpse of. That knife fight between the soldiers near the trenches was legit harrowing and probably the best part of the movie.",rlvtls
hqcaehj,I honestly thought it was pretty good. Seeing the fate of Conrad was a nice subversion to the old legacy inheritance I thought they wouldve pulled. In the end it was a fun historical fiction with a solid first half kind of setting up a solid premise and the second half going wild with it.,rlvtls
hpipyed,"I felt this movie had no direction. What the goal was changed from scene to scene. Characters were introduced and then killed off within two scenes. The reveal of who the Scotsman was was extremely anti climactic and very obvious. The plan also made no sense to me. Why is everyone on board with mr Scottish independence? Why did Zemo send the Zimmerman telegram even though that was completely contrary to their goals? Where even did the final fight take place? Sure as hell wasn’t Scotland but they never said where his secret barn lair was.

I also felt that they didn’t utilize the time period very well. The only time where it kind of mattered was when he jumped out of the plane with an early parachute, but even that wasn’t that exciting. The other kingsmen movies got bonkers, I would have loved to have seen them battle on top of a zeppelin about to blow up the queens palace or something. This movie doesn’t care about any other historical accuracies or details, so why not.

And finally, I could not give less of a shit about the origin of the Kingsmen. It kind of felt like the movie knew this too, because it felt extremely forced. Overall I thought it was a big let down.",rlvtls
hqh5e6y,"The tonal shifts in this film are jarring as hell. You go from a campy Rasputin slurping at someone’s leg and dance-fighting on tabletops to a young man weeping in the trenches as he realizes the horrors of war first hand—in the span of like 20 minutes. 

On the other hand, it certainly beat a history lesson about WWI into my head. “There were three cousins…” indeed.",rlvtls
hpnywyr,"Okay key point reviews about this movie.

-Fucking loved every scene with Djimon Hounsou man. Kinda blown away that he’s so good in every movie he’s in but he’s always barely used

-some of the fight sequences were some of my favorite and least favorite of the series. While the No man’s land night fight was spectacular, i found the big mountain dude fight (while having a great finish) was really bogged down imo by how it felt really just “big dude can’t feel pain” is the entire gimmick.

-i loved all the “proto-kingsman” references in this movie, it felt way more organic than how some other prequels handled them. Like seeing the kingsman manor, how ralph fiennes’ flare gun looks to be what the kingsman sidearms are based on, etc

-the ending kinda just……happened. It felt like the movie was going at its own pace up until the ralph fiennes gets out of his slump and just solves the plot

-the villain twist was so bad imo. My brother literally leaned over after he came outta the shadows and went “who tf is that” 

-this movie felt an hour too long man. If they tightened up the story a bit and did more Kingsman stuff. It would of been great. 

All in all the movies okay but should of been about kingsman more. 7/10",rlvtls

hpy7i5a,"Rasputin was the biggest highlight of the movie, and the only portion that featured the over the top wackiness that Kingsman did so well in the original. 

Makes sense now why they plastered that character/fight all over the promotional material…people would be less interested if they found out that the movie was really just an LQ version of 1917.",rlvtls
hppz9et,"I liked it.  Not as good as the first 2, but I still enjoyed it.

I legit wasn't expecting Conrad to die.  I thought he was gonna be the first Galahad.  Although making Polly the first Galahad made sense.  She was the one that kept Oxford on the path.

Djimon Hounsou was the shit.  That's not a shock.

Nice little moment showing that the Kingsmen in part 1 had lost part of their way. Most outside of Harry and Merlin looked down on Eggsy for his background.  But when looking at the founding members, one was a soldier (Archie) and 2 were servants.  They'd more than welcome Eggsy.

Liked the mention of Statesman.  The butler was part of the Kingsmen spy ring, so maybe he plays a role in Statesman entering the spy business.

Rasputin was fun.  And of course Zemo is manipulating powers to fight each other.",rlvtls
hqqs2vr,"I thought the movie was good, but I they tried to fit a lot of stuff into this. Between getting to know characters like Oxford, Conrad, Shola and Polly, the Scottish villain, Rasputin, all those other baddies, the three cousins, the political intrigue, WWI, and a Kingsman origin all in one. It was just too much. Some of it worked.

Ralph Fiennes carried the movie on his back. He was great. Rasputin was definitely a highlight, and the film peaked in that awesome fight sequence with the 1812 Overture playing in the background. The No Man's Land stuff was great. Gemma Arterton and Djmon Honsou were good, but I felt like they should've had more to do.

The film did take a little dip in quality when Rasputin died. They almost got it back with the war stuff in the middle, but I feel like it never got that energy back. The climax was a sword fight in a barn against a villain we just met when all we saw was the back of his head the whole time. There was no weight to it at all, IMO.

I liked what they were trying to do with Conrad, and his death was sudden and shocking, but it wasn't devastating because I don't think he left that much of an impact for me to care. The villains other than Rasputin were pretty bland. I don't even know why they were following that guy, or what was in it for them. Daniel Bruhl was wasted, the American (?) Woman they had was just there, and the main villain reveal was underwhelming. 

I get what they were going for, but they tried doing too much. Solid movie still. Better than Kingsman 2 for sure. 

The origin is out of the way now. Instead of staying in the past, I like to see a movie covering Kingsman agencies in other parts of the world. Let's get away from the Brits for a little. A Statesman movie, or Japanese Kingsman flick would kick all sorts of ass. And as much as I like Matthew Vaughn and his work, let him take a break so we can see what another team can do with this franchise.",rlvtls

The guy stuck on the lift was such a small character, but soooo funny. Rasputin was MVP. His fight scene was off the walls. 

I don’t need a movie to “come together” if it’s not trying to. This one wasn’t. It just wanted to tell a wild story that ended with the Kingsmen being formed. It did a pretty great job. 

Excited for Tucci to hopefully be in the next oooone",rlvtls
hq9oncf,"The last 20 minutes if this film, from the bi-plane sequence onwards, really clicked and showed what the film could have been. Up til then it was just a really weird tonal mess.

Even crazier how Brühl and Diehl are basically bit players, probably saving them for a sequel along with Taylor-Johnson and Tucci. I don’t know how well this film is performing but I would be down for that sequel.",rlvtls

As a standalone film/origin story, I loved the introduction into this world. I also loved the way the Oxford family story unfolded with all its twists and turns. These were both supported by an incredible cast who brought their strong characters alive and played off each other in a very fun way.

But as the product of the American public school system, I was lost the entire time. Was this historically accurate? Would that even matter? I already know the Allies won; what's all this stuff going on in the meantime? What are the stakes? I just don't think that the American moviegoers were the target audience for this.

Still, I can appreciate the strong anti-war sentiments and the universal themes of family, country, and duty. Hope they can expand on this with another installment about WWII-- a more well-known war. I'd still give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 because it was so well-made. You should definitely watch it and judge it for yourselves.

- The sudden shift in tone to the deadly serious trench warfare was nice, I didn't think it was that jarring. I appreciated the subversion where he miraculously evades every bullet and explosion just to die so pointlessly over his own mistake. 

- Like a few films these days, it acts very confident of it's ability to get a sequel. Setting up or introducing characters and plots for no real narrative purpose other than to set up the players or events of a sequel.

It had a nod to all the most important figures of the time. The overhead shots of the battlefield really conveyed the horrors of war. The deaths really showed no one was safe.

What's good:  The performances, cinematography, (most) of the special FX, sound design, set design...I'm struggling to think of what else I can say.  


What sucked:  The writing.  Oh My God, this is a horrible movie.  


I could never understand the tone of the film.  The first two were comedic while intertwined with high stakes.  (The first probably more than the second.)  This?  I don't know what they were going for. There's very little that's meant to be funny and when it does try, it usually doesn't work.  The arc with the son Conrad seems like a different film - that portion being blatant Period Oscar Bait, while the rest of the film was a mishmash of scenes that only moved the story forward at the expense of logic.

No actors can be faulted here, and the standout was most likely Rhys Ifans as Rasputin.  He was genuinely interesting,  magnificently played and ultimately misused.  And speaking of him - what the hell film?  You have a character who can CURE SICKNESS and you just blow over that like it's nothing?  THAT SECRET COULD WIN THE WAR!  All your soldiers can live to fight another day!  And that healing scene itself was just BIZARRE.  Were they trying to be funny?  For a second I honestly thought the two outside were going to bust in and have a Three's Company moment, thinking Oxford was getting blown by Rasputin.  Again, the tone - ALL over the place.    


I despised the ""pep talk"" that got Oxford  to come to his senses.  There's no reason that should have been the turning point for him to finally straighten him out other than the movie needed it to get to the last act.  I will give the movie credit for a reveal that I did not see coming, so well done on that, film.  But the ridiculousness of the action scenes at the end made me ultimately not care.  Oxford crashed his plane into the side of the mountain and no one heard or investigated that?  Really?  I WANT to have a suspension of belief when watching a movie, but my GOD.    


The movie comes to its conclusion, and we meet the founding members of Kingsman.  I'm pretty sure the film is expecting the audience to stand up from their seats and cheer at this, and I swear the soundtrack played the literal Avengers theme here.  But it just made no sense.  Why is the guy Conrad Oxford randomly picked out of the lineup a founding member?  Why is he a ""good man"", as Conrad said in his letter?  How would he know?   Maybe I just missed something here?    


As the credits rolled, I just considered it a bad movie, but had no real harsh feelings for it.    


Then the mid-credits scene happened.  


Another character reveal is made here, and it turned this movie into complete shit.  This is your teaser?  Fuck you, film.  This is the stupidest tease, and I hate you for it.  You're a lousy film and not worth anyone's time.",rlvtls

hqddrud,"Feels a little propaganda for me to enjoy; revisionist white-washing of the British side of the events that lead up to WWI. They did everything to slob on royal knob; going so far as to rally that of all the Victoria-descended kings: Georgie was the good one \*slurp\*-\*slurp\*-\*slurp\*, enjoy your incoming knighthood, Vaughn. 

Apparently fuck the Benelux and French for all their involvement in this fight on their home soil, and for all Woodrow Wilson's fucking issues -namely federalizing segregation, impropriety wasn't one of them -the dude had to deal with his wife dying during his first term before remarrying in office, certainly not preventing American entry into WWI. Here's an uncomfortable truth, world: Woodrow Wilson explicitly won his second term on the campaign slogan of ""He Kept Us Out of the War."" Germany would go on to fuck that up with that Zimmerman Telegram that served as a quarter of the film's plot and return to unrestricted submarine warfare from the concessions that Woodrow Wilson forced from them in his first term. America's late entry into the war absolutely mitigated the losses that they would undergo once committed; two years and change of watching the great powers beat each other stupid, drain their manpower and material, and see enough lessons to ensure doughboy wouldn't march in there like it was still the era of line infantry and cavalry charges. America's last total war was the American Civil War, with subsequent conflicts fought by significantly smaller expeditionary forces across the Americas and the Pacific. This would be their debut into the meatgrinder of Europe. If Teddy Roosevelt had his way, we'd have twice the number of graves overseas. As it was, America wasn't prepared to take care of its own veterans after that war, and that lead to some ugliness of its own.

When the secondary plot is compelling a beguiled American prez to committing his nation to this European fuck-up, holy shit what did I walk into.

Hell, Mata Hari IRL was aimed by French intel to go after Kaiser Wilhem II before the opposed intel agencies decided to play volleyball using her and she stupidly stayed in the game. A more realistic take would have been writing the woman who would become Woodrow's second wife as the mole -perhaps the agent that poisoned the first First Lady who historically succumbed a kidney disease (this was a real-life controversy for Wilson). Historically, that lady went on to be a shadow president for over a year while Wilson was terribly degraded in mental and physical ability by the stroke he suffered OCT1919. Harding didn't enter office till MAR1921.

Kitchener was a fucking butcher that embodied everything that needed to be condemned about Victorian England; I love how they even portrayed Boer War Concentration Camps and still tried to play him off as a beloved uncle. The only kudos to his entire participation in the movie is how a U-boat is depicted sinking HMS Hampshire, and the press reporting it (true to life) as a mine strike. All I can say is that Charles Dance can turn anyone into a lovable figure.

Mustached mad Scot with a penchant for goats. Huh. That's the best we could do? Fat Bastard was at least an affectionate parody, this one is just vicious. Sorry Scotland...

I generally don't like it when fiction plays with real events. They even cutesied up the liquidation of the Romanovs.

The founding generation of Kingsmen should have involved a collection of WWI survivors who in their own way, interacted with this first set of adapted IRL villains and foiled their activities alongside Conrad and his support network (a case of the common grunt actually benefitting from privilege). Better yet, you could have had some young tailor from Kingsmen enlisting as Conrad's aide and their deaths would have been catalyst. People that Conrad would have been able to befriend them each step along the way, not just the one Scot he swapped places with. If he got more or less adopted in and made into the organization, how the fuck was he not involved in that plateau assault? 

You already some illuminati bullshit going on with the cavalcade of historical figures, why not go full Assassin's Creed and just have the Kingsmen tailors be revealed as an offshoot of Weaver assassins protecting their clientele.

The entire Conrad thing was a terrible bait and switch. Protecting the boy from the world... Shola is training the kid Dune-style, and the boy is perfectly aware that the nanny is the maid version of Annie Oakley. Somehow, there is still surprise that papa was running his own intel agency.

The first hour has SO much set up that when Conrad did finally go to war and subsequently get shot in the face for not saying his name I was shocked at the twist but really didn’t care. Honestly I wish it had happened 45 minutes earlier so we could get to the actual “kingsman” part of the film.

hq8vpcq,"Had to write a response on this...I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.  I really liked 1 wasn't a fan of 2 so I came into this with decent expectations.

First off I really enjoyed the relationship between the father and son.  It was very understandable why the father was so protective and because of him being so protective it was understandable why the son was obsessed with fighting and getting out on his own. A scene that pops out to me is the dad explaining why war isn't fun and it's pretty horrible by recounting his own tales in war and his son just ignoring him and talking immediately about enlisting.  One of the hardest scenes for me in any movie this year was his son crying with the wounded soldier and just so regretful for not listening to his father while in the partial trench, that scene hit me hard.

I really like the tone shifts in the movie and I really enjoyed Rasputin and wish we had his character more. I enjoyed the fighting scenes but I can admit some things could be considered over the top (the big guy not feeling pain thing). I wasn't a big fan of the main villain who was exposed last because I saw the reveal coming from a mile away (watch in the scene at the Kingsman tailor they never show that actor's left hand which would've had a ring on). I really do feel like the best part of this movie was dad and son's relationship and was pleased how they handled the movie after the son's death.  It was obvious the dad was done living for himself and he just planned on living his life as what his son had actually wanted to be if he had lived.

I enjoyed the supporting characters and I could write a lot more about this movie but overall I'm giving it a 9/10.  This movie is worth watching, although this movie is a lot different from the 1st and 2nd, I believe this may be my favorite in the series so far.",rlvtls

Conrad has zero interesting characterization, and comes off as just a rich boy who desperately wants to play war, then gets surprised when oops, it sucks. Because apparently he was unable to read stories about the trenches. 

They then drab Conrad up when the main character is fighting the (nonsensical) villain, and a Big Deal is made about how ""Well I'm a pacifist but Conrad knows that killing is necessary sometimes!""...when like two hours ago the same ""pacifist"" character was happily stabbing Rasputin over and over again while screaming.

Very disappointed. Got the impression that they were trying to make two different movies - Rasputin scene aside (the part with ""healing"" the leg was cringey, to say the least, but the fight was fun), this felt like a WWI spy film until Vaughn seemed to remember he was making a Kingsman movie

The 20-minute sequence at the Xmas party was great and kinda made up for the more forgettable first act. Rhys Ifans was great as Rasputin.

Also Matthew Vaughn's direction was a lot more on the level. I really had the ugly digital push-ins and plastic-y CGI in the first 2 Kingsman films and this felt a lot more grounded, comparatively speaking.

hqcorgn,"Taking an unusual direction from the previous two Kingsman movies, The King’s Man ends up being far more serious and heavily influenced by historical events that happened a hundred years ago. Because of how much the film tries to tie these events into the story, it can feel confusing and messy with what is going on. Depending on expectations, people may end up being disappointed with this prequel.

Matthew Vaughn’s stylistic direction still flourishes in the action sequences and panning shots. The new set of characters in this prequel/origin story include standouts such as Rhys Ifans playing the crazy Russian Rasputin chewing the scenery and acting crazy, and Ralph Fiennes’ Oxford playing a dad who ends up bringing some genuine strength and emotion to the spy role with great stability.

Other characters also play their parts well, and the film looks pretty good in terms of production values and historical accuracy. If one thing is missing, it’s the sense of charm and silliness of the first two films. That being said, the last third of the film did get me invested again. However, it wasn’t quite enough to make up for the first hour or so of the film. The little glimpses of humour is present, but much rarer as the film focuses more on Drama.

My overall thoughts on The King’s Man is I appreciate them trying something different here, despite not staying as consistently entertaining as the first two films. The twists and turns are a little hit and miss, but the way it ties into Kingsman at the very end works really well. In the end, I’d say The King’s Man is worth at least a single watch, despite being much different and more different in perspective. 6/10",rlvtls

hy5tlbm,"Sooo many things about this movie that don't make sense. A lot has been said already, main issue being that it's tone deaf and all over the place. I'll add a few points I haven't seen in this thread yet (》SPOILERS《 I don'thave the fancy pants editor) :

1. Polly is the real hero and I'm so tired of movies that let side characters (often women, or poc) do all the heavy lifting while allowed no character development (or even emotions for that matter) while we're stuck with a self-pitying main character that swoops in and takes the credit.
2. How the hell does Oxford climb that mountain horizontally when he does no training whatsoever after years with a crappy leg? Or any of the other things he does. 
3. Please can we finally give Djimon Hounsou finally his own action movie? These roles where he's from unknown descent (""it's Africa who cares"") and his roles play into all of the stereotypes, while he has all the skill and none of the story underserve him and it's irritating because he could be way more. 
4. Wtf did they do with conrad. So you find out your dad has a secret worldwide spy org, you just got to go on a cool mission with him,  and instead of diving deeper into that you still wanna die in the trenches? I'm not even gonna waste words on how he died, it's been discussed. But fuck that whole entire storyline
5. Also, the dying mum. Like what did you think was gonna happen bringing your kid directly into a warzone? She literally just gave him a speech on the importance of their work and now she's like ""oh this isn't the disneyland I thought it was better keep him away from this"". Though probably fitting for rich people with a savior complex that are faced with reality. But it was still stupid.
6. If oxford didn't wanna be involved he probably shouldn't have...been involved. ""Do as I say don't do as I do"", ofc when your son sees you meeting with the head of the military all the time he'll think there's honor in being in the military. 
7. Motives were so all over the place. But also the founding principles of the organization itself. At least the first two movies had a ridiculous but worldwide and apolitical threat. It's believable that kingsmen interfere for the good of all humanity (""independent, seperate of governments, etc.""). This movie did the opposite of that, it was super political and it's not for the good of innocent people in general but just for those that happen to be British. 
8. Moreover, it becomes what it accuses the elite of. It makes the case that lives are wasted over a family feud between 3 cousins who didn't get along in childhood, only to the show us hours of bickering between this dad and his son, the dad eventually breaking his promise to never kill because it suddenly became personal when his son was killed. So much so that he spends enormous amounts of money to start an organization that basically doesn't give a fuck about killing as long as it's to support whatever viewpoint they hold at a given moment.

I can go on and on about how ridiculous this movie is. It could've been great satire and all the above points could've been overlooked and be chuckled at. Instead it took itself very serious and it's much harder to be so forgiving.",rlvtls

i gotta say, i actually really liked this film!!

i love Matthew Vaughn and the first Kingsman is absolute phenomenal. When i went to go see the sequel, i was so incredibly let down when i walked out of the theater… it wasn’t unwatchable, there were some good moments, but overall just felt very flashy and forgettable. 

However, this third movie was really not bad! i have a few minor issues with it but overall, it was a very cool take on WW1! Or a different perspective rather… it kind of had the feel of Inglorious Basterds imo. 

I loved how the film wasn’t shoving “Kingsman” in your face, it was very subtle to put the characters first. The plot got a little messy but the pacing was well done and i was fully invested the whole time! The action scenes and cinematography were an absolute 10/10 for me, i mean after all, it’s Matthew Vaughn and his stylized nature is so incredible and intriguing to me. 

The only main downside i had was that it felt a little loaded at times and had too much going on, i mean, after all it is about WW1 and had a lot of different countries involved lol i was a little confused with some characters and the overall plot but in the end, i did understand it and it wrapped itself up nicely.  


Hoping for a 4th film that has to do with WW2 based off that post credit scene! it’s really cool to see different takes on history especially in this crazy stylized manner (again, similar to Inglorious Basterds)

This movie really felt like it mattered, it fully encapsulated what the ‘Kingsman’ is and gave a fresh take on it, redeeming itself from that god awful sequel (The Golden Circle) 

Overall i’d say 7.8/10. I’m so glad this movie turned out well!!!!!🙌🙏",rlvtls
hwbmukr,"I loved it, but there were parts which I skipped through. I was startled by the are decision of a Hollywood movie to actually kill off a central character Harris Dickinson's character - very rare.

Rasputin was great, but the mf died by a gunshot to his head, did he not see someone pointing the gun at him?

Action sequences scenes were very oddly shot (zoom in and outs), following the tradition. I definitely could've enjoyed more if the story was laid out better.",rlvtls

hwhzi5w,"Not sure if anyone will see this comment as I'm pretty late to the game, but hear me out. Am I the only one who until the very end thought that Sheppard would be a distant relative of late Merlin? When they only showed him from the back,  and made accent on his Scottish heritage (remember how Merlin said ""For Scotland"" in second movie?) I thought it only made sense for the villian to be played by Mark Strong, a bad apple, which Merlin's bloodline renounces by working at Kingsman. Feel like a missed opportunity. Also the ""manners maketh a men"", having the phrase originate from one within rather than an evil hillbilly rando would add an extra level. Although perhaps this is just something for next episode?",rlvtls
hwxav5y,"I'm kinda shocked at all the people who are using how campy and over the top this movie is as a con. I've seen a handful of people saying it's bad because it's historically inaccurate, akin to Drunk History.

And it's like... Yeah? It's Kingsmen. Of course it's over the top and campy. The Hitler reveal was absolutely ridiculous, but the entire series is ridiculous. A guy getting brainwashed into shooting up the Westboro Baptist Church, getting shot in the head, then revived afterwards is okay. But the Hitler scene? That's too far, man.",rlvtls
hxil3zt,"This one works best as a mindless bit of escapism.  I, for one, enjoyed that the insanity was tempered by the World War I setting.  Even so, it was still just as crazy as the other two movies. 

Ralph Fiennes fit the role of Kingsmen founder very well and I felt a great deal of sympathy for his character considering the family he winds up losing.  Djimon Hounsou was also good as the sidekick Merlin.  

That no man's land sequence was terrific and I loved the tragic irony of it.  Vaughan handled it well. 

The action set pieces are fun.  I liked the whole bit with Rasputin and the climactic mountain top sequence between Fiennes and the main villain.  

I didn't care all that much about the plot behind the war and the villain's reveal got a shrug from me.  But, that's also why I think this is best approached in a mindless way.   

Overall, I felt it was a nice change of pace after the disastrous Golden Circle.",rlvtls
hxk2nch,"Wtf did I just watch Rasputin licking Ralph Fieness' leg vagina. Shit is goddam weird, and that the nicest thing I can say about it",rlvtls
hxkrwsa,"Great movie until Rasputin is killed and then its slowly strangled by the setting.

When its total farce its fantastic.

When its grim, somber, and serious it becomes a war story other movies have done better and far more accurately. 

**The Good:**

1) Casting was fantastic! 

Rhys Ifans stole the show! I know Rasputin is a villain in other stories but other stories didn't have a Rasputin this dynamic and a joy to watch, should've been the mastermind. Charles Dance as Kitchener was hilarious with the Tywin Lannister subtext lol.

2) I loved the montages about WW1, the cousins heads on maps, the shells, the timelapse sequence of how the western front became cut up by trenches. Good stuff.

3) Ralph Fiennes getting trapped in the wing of his plane was an amazing gag/obstacle, felt unique to the setting. 

**The Bad:**

1) Where was France? This movie took its time to explain the geopolitics and I don't think France gets a mention.

2) That tone shift is a problem. The movie wants it both ways, to be taken very seriously and not seriously at all. ""The Kingsmen"" did a far better job mixing in tender moments between absurdity probably because heartfelt moments weren't a total detour from everything else.

3) The Kingsmen are fully formed in all but name before the movie begins. How the agency came to be was a major draw and definitely the more interesting story. We've never gotten an over the top spy film in the lead up to WW1 but we have a glut of melancholy father-son war flicks.

4) The mastermind plot was a bad twist and a bad reused plot line.",rlvtls

hxsl309,"I understand all of the complaints and issues I'm hearing about. Despite all that, I freaking loved this movie. The main characters (The Duke, Conrad, Polly, and Shola) were all charismatic and sympathetic to a fault. The action sequences were brilliant (the Rasputin fight, and the entire WWI sequence are in my top three Kingsman franchise fights). Rhys Ifans is an absolute scene-stealer. Ralph Fiennes, Harris Dickinson, Gemma Arterton, and Djimon Hounsou all ground the story *just* enough to fit the seriousness of war, and the goofiness of the Kingsman franchise. There were some portions where I thought the tonal shifts were a bit too much, and the villain reveal at the end was much less than pleasing, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself when watching this movie.

Seriously ""be the man your son would have been""? Like are you trying to motivate him or inherent his wealth after you make him eat a bullet? It's a film that revels in the gritty drama of war while being interspersed with over the top action that doesn't live up to its predecessors. It flat out breaks your suspension of disbelief by trying to have its cake and using so voldemort can seduce Rasputin. Still the most unbelievable thing in the film is that some random cunt from the north could pose a threat to anyone beyond the goats he's obviously fucking. This film was as shite as that posh cunts Scottish accent.",rlvtls

It also in a way weakened the rest of the film for me though, as I really liked the father and son dynamic and felt like it was intended to be a clear parallel to Firth and eggsy in the first two. I thought the concept of “be the man your son was supposed to be” was kind of a weird sentiment to fuel the motive for the end. Conrad’s sense of duty was still something i think his father agreed with, just not how to go about it. Watching Ralph be the central action hero was a bit odd, would’ve liked to see he and his son together at the end. Overall it was a lot better than I expected based off the reviews.

The first two movies were so over-the-top, with great villains who seemed to be having so much fun in the roles. With this one, by the time they did the reveal of the 'big bad', you just didn't care. They attempted to do a serious movie! I have no idea what the writer/director was thinking.

I would give it 2 out of 5 stars, mainly because of Rasputin. The actor playing Rasputin seems to 'get it' and just chewed the scenery. Everyone else, meh.",rlvtls

I thought it started out pretty boring, and picked up at the Rasputin fight scene, which is also probably where it peaked. I came for the cool and stylized action sequences but basically got none of it. It’s really not much of an action movie. It never got crazy like the first 2. I liked the WW1 scenes in a vacuum, but it seemed out of place in this movie. The villains secret hideout was Jurassic World 2 levels of confusing. The “twist”/reveal at the end was anticlimactic and underwhelming. And the lore of the founding of the Kingsmen felt kinda just thrown in at the end. Overall I’d give it a 5.9/10",rlvtls

hqdeb00,"Complete stinker. I found myself nodding off during the second act, and honestly it was hard to tell where the 1st act started and the second began. The pacing was awful. This movie was a tonal disaster. The saving grace was everything Rasputin, and again they focused on his bisexuality why too intensely, as opposed to the dozen other very eccentric qualities he supposedly possessed. 

The only thing “Kingsman” about this movie was the last 20 minutes, where the Duke magically knows how to assemble gadgets and foreign technology (seriously why tf didn’t we see any of this intuition throughout the movie). I really wanted more from the Duke in that regard. Something to latch on to. Whether it’s wits, or expertise in combat, just something to make him a character that I would believe is formidable and unique. 

As for the villain? I mean, come on. What the hell was that? In what world is Morton able to sneak away for considerable durations and have these super secret meetings? And why do his followers care about his agenda? What the fuck even was his agenda? 

Oh yeah and Conrad was a total drag. Extremely boring character. 

Overall this movie gave me nothing to care about. I would have left happier if the movie started and ended with Rasputin. 

I genuinely didn’t think it could get worse than the second movie. 

The performances were good. Fight choreography especially in the Rasputin scenes were above average. The score was sometimes great and other times grating.

Because of the WWI setting people ahve I this expectation of seriousness and reverence for a time like that and think fun and “silly” elements can’t be added into this world and thinks it’s not meshing well. Don’t get me wrong! The first movie with its violence and colorful characters in the villains made it jarring and  hard to digest ! But I immediately ignored those elements and picked up on the good. The choreographed fights, the Characters and their dynamics the world of the kingsman ect. All hood and entertaing things. This movie only solidified it! The dukes character very much so is the sport of the kingsman. Not just a spy organization but a way to create better men and people.",rlvtls

hqfqvmq,"Surprising that this is a part of the Kingsman series. Apart from it having the tailors the original is named after and a few nods to the other 2 in this, it was quite a different film. Lot less funny. A lot of it was like a serious war drama, with one scene that really reminded me of 1917. Which also had one moment that genuinely shocked me so I'd hand it to them for that.

Other than that there wasn't much special to this but it was still entertaining enough with some good action, though I'm sure there was some major stunt actor with done with Ralph Fiennes fights.
I was surprised to see quite a few big stars in this that I didn't see in the marketing. Some had pretty minor roles considering how well known they are.
Didn't realise it was Rhys Ifans playing Rasputin until i looked at IMDB either.

While the USA didn't have much in the way of manpower contribution till about when Russia exited the war, the USA joined in April 1917 and Russia didn't officially leave till March 1918 and unofficially in November 1917 after the 'October Revolution' (calendar difference). So there wasn't really as much pressure towards the end as there was irl but pretty much everything else in broad strokes was correct which is impressive and funny.

hwtnl06,"For the record I really enjoyed both Kingsman films but I’m about half an hour into this movie and I cannot believe what I’m hearing, this is beyond moronic. I’ve heard satirical films make more sense that this.

I was really curious why the ‘King of England’ keeps being mentioned when that title hasn’t existed for hundreds of years. I just put it down to an American writer or director being ignorant or just not doing their research but after the reveal of Shepherd saying that King George has ruined Scotland and wants Germany to invade I just burst out laughing and I’m sat here with it on pause.

Sorry but what? That LITERALLY makes no sense, they’re the same fucking country. It’s like saying you, as someone from California, hate Texas so I’m going to ask Russia to invade it.

I can only assume this will be addressed later in the film because I am astonished that this has been thought up by anyone who knows anything about history. Quite possibly the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard in a film ever. And I’ve seen film where a King Leonidas parody breakdances for some reason.",rlvtls

hxjkjtk,"Now that this hit streaming, I say the movie is worth its 2 hour runtime if you are looking for a fun entertaining action movie that you don’t have to take that seriously. 

I liked the first one, didn’t care for the second, and found this one in the middle of the two in terms of quality. It certainly lacks the charm of the other two, but I think makes up for it in its set pieces and the action. 

The No Man’s Land section steals the show. Loved that the soldiers had this unspoken realization to each other to remain quiet, as too much noise would alert both forces and force them to fire, killing everyone. Was excellent. And Conrad being shot after that scene was legitimately shocking. While I didn’t care for the character, I always give credit to a movie for surprising me with a character death. 

Rasputin is another bright spot, they had a lot of fun with the mythos surrounding him at that time. His ballerina dancing fighting style was amazingly choreographed, and I wish he was the big bad instead of angry, spitting Scottish fencer slash cashmere goat herder (?). 

Not sure if Kingsmen is good enough to have an entire cinematic universe like they are doing, with only one film being beloved by the fans, but I’m here to see how it plays out. Looking forward to some ATJ and Tucci for the next one if this did well enough, don’t think it performed too hot at the box office though… fingers crossed for me. 

All in all, it plays fast and loose with historical accuracy in service of setting up this universe, so a lot of stuff doesn’t really make sense (Hitler and Lenin on the same side? LOL). But I don’t really go into a Kingsmen movie looking for anything more than over the top action, good set pieces, and it’s goofy charm. I’ll settle for two out of three.

ALSO. The goats? MVP. Took me on a real journey at the end there. From just chilling on the side of the mountain almost insultingly (not that hard to climb this bro), to butting Voldemorts head almost off the edge, to saving the day by impaling the Shepard. LMAO loved that.",rlvtls

Here’s what I would have done after con s death:

Don’t have the kingsman s name or shop exist out of thin air , instead build on it, get Conrad KIA, that young scott who swapped places with him at first doesn’t know what going on and out of anger and revengefulness the dad thinks of a plan to make
Up a group to eliminate those who planned ww1. Since con is dead the father has no choice but to take that scott kid under his wing , show him the ropes and all together device s plan to actually take down the villain.. After the war ends they realise it’s possible another big thing can happen in the future threatening millions of lives - let’s now form kingsman and give it its name at the end and basically be this revolutionary group that stops those who try to cause a catastrophe to other..

The majority of the movie was about an overly protective father telling his son, ""war is bad, sons just go out to die there."" The few scenes they show in the trailer excited me but the movie was severely lackluster.

It's not a Kingsman movie, it's a retold WW1 movie involving a father and son. 

The son's death was so abrupt, it made absolutely no sense. Considering how KM1 was about British elites losing their heirs you'd expect more families than just the oxfords.

But I'm that kind of movie watched who completely respects what genre and level of corn they were working for and accepts it, and I love bad b-movies when they're really bad. 

If anything, most A-movies are trash and fail at what they're trying to do. Love a film that accepts its b-ness and rolls with it.

It’s suitably British and surprisingly historically accurate to a good extent. I had no idea Willy, George and Nick were related. That Queen V was more prolific  a woman than I had thought. 

It was a bit melancholic for a good portion of the film and switched gears when the Ralph Fiennes character takes the lead. 

The Rasputin character was the highlight of the film and made for a great villain. 

Ash for the Scottish goat herder… were we supposed to take him seriously?  The scenes with him were tolerable, but the movie could have been more without him. Rasputin made a better final boss.

After the death, the movie moves with purpose since the dad is on a mission to solve problems and get stuff done.

Very much agreed.  
  
My only qualm, though, is that he still dies for a heroic cause by successfully returning the film canister leading to the US entering the war. And in tribute to him, the *King himself* along with the *best friend of the Scottish soldier who killed Conrad* become **founding members** of The Kingsman..

hq43hvn,"It's weird, with the opening of them visiting British concentration camps, the Duke of Oxford's backstory of vowing pacifism after committing atrocities for the empire, and the main villain being a Scot who wants to destroy England as revenge for English oppression, the movie seems like it's trying to interrogate the myth of the British empire being a force for good. This theme also ties into the son's desire to join the war. Is it a good thing to die for your country? Is serving your country a noble cause when your country is a force of oppression? The idea of the Kingmen could have come from the desire for an independent agency that wouldn't just enforce colonial power but prioritize saving lives, even if it went against the interests of your nation.

The movie raises these themes but then tosses them aside without much consideration, leaving them feeling like superficial additions that give the appearance of condemning British colonialism without tackling any of the hard questions related to that.

Moreover, while the real Felix Yusupov did not have the Duke of Oxford (or his son) for a cousin, he was good friends with an Englishman he met while studying at Oxford. At the time of Rasputin's murder that Englishman was an agent of MI6 in Russia, and it is speculated that he took part in the assassination (however, there seem to be no relevant documents in the MI6 archives).

The movie is obsessed with the british empire aesthetic. It seems to love the Bond Street tailoring, clipped words and mustaches, firm handshakes, pretty women and loyal servants. But it doesn't do more than a cursory nod towards acknowledging the horrors the british empire was responsible for at that time. 

its never more obvious than during the front line scenes where the Germans are dressed very much like Nazis, despite being set 20 years before Nazism was even a twinkle in Mr Hitler's eye. 

Its because the Nazi helmet and black cloak are an immediate trigger for modern audiences to recognise ""bad guy"". 

Which is a bit of an issue because it sets the british, and therefore the british empire in the light of ""good guy"". Which, as we know, is rather a difficult position to defend. 

I'm not 100% certain of my history here, but my understanding is that England never ""conquered"" Scotland, and that it had been sovereign until about 1700, roughly around when the United Kingdom was formed, and had been chill pretty much since then. Even before that, various british kings had been Scottish. I think we've traditionally had a rather good relationship since about 1300? So why they cast the villain as a bitter scotsman? I can't justify in any other way but as a weird ""fuck you"" to Scotland.

Like it’s a meme nihilist movie where WWI was started by Scottish Matthew Goode running the “deep state” and I still knew someone would mention how “unreal” the mountain goat was. Christ

And the movie was pretty good. Not often you get to see 3 movies with conflicting messages get past editing as one package and it was a fun novelty. Nihilist in the sense of showing concentration camps at the start, calling them out somewhat, then praising the guy responsible as a hero through all the English characters. Is that bad writing, changing your mind on concentration camps mid script, or meta nihilism on none of our “heroic” characters giving a fuck? Same with fiennes being anti empire then killing the Scottish guy (presumed victim of the empire and people like fiennes) with a Victoria cross. Hitler and Lenin are deep state operatives working for some kind of mystical right/left balance and king George is the only historical figure portrayed as being okay (shockingly because his daughter is the current queen of the country making the film). 

Like the man is all over the place mentally or he actually purposely makes a “hero/villain” film where anyone can see the inconsistencies that are barely separated. Considering his first film layer cake is a crime movie about a “smart guy crime boss” making his way up only for it to end with a complete troll/subversion that recontextualised the film id say the latter is actually possible. He seems to like doing insane messy shit, have every character be the worst whether that’s text explicit or noticeable through the contradictions (as per layer cake before the end confirms the main character has always been a clown) and that’s definitely more interesting than anything he’s done between these films, which all have elements of everyone being the worst but are still very “Hollywood structure”

Like if this wasn’t a big studio project I would not be shocked if they all got shot in the final kingsman scene by someone who had their family killed by fiennes/the English.

hpix20y,"And that's a problem how exactly? We can't have two leads for a time? Even if it's 2 thirds of the movie, we still focus a hell of a lot on the father snd his perspective so its not like it was ever confusing that he's at the *least* as important as his son even if you expected his son to end up like eggsy and become the protag. Really, if one hadn't seen the first two then one *could* reasonably come to the assumption that the first guy we stick with in the intro, the dad, is the protag and basically nothing in the movie would suggest too much otherwise lol. 

If anything the kid's constant insistence that he go to war heavily suggests that he's *not* the protag since this isn't a war film and that'd take him right out of the spy plot (which is exactly what ends up happening lol).",rlvtls

hs6pz59,"Only saw the film last night, but yeah I'd agree that it seemed odd that they picked him for Merlin.
I assume the codebreaking scenes were moved from Shola to Polly just before filming, and I'd assume cut scenes of Shola putting together those hidden cameras/recorders etc to make him being Merlin make more sense?

It either made more sense (to me, at least) to have had Shola at the table, and Polly as Merlin, or give Shola the codebreaking scenes.",rlvtls

i5pzbk9,"As a scotish-American, I was so confused because I kept hearing villains accent and thought it was terrible, but then I'd hear the Scotish soldiers accents and I thought they were real. So I was thinking ""..if they have scotish actors, wouldnt they make the scotish-speaking villain be a scotish actor?"" And since that seemed like a no brainers to me, I decided that it meant the villain _was_ scotish, and that, as an American, I must have no idea what scotish people actually sound like, despite having met and spoken to a fair amount. 

So glad to learn that it was a fake accent after all, but also very confused why they didnt just use a scotish actor who could fake an english accent.",rlvtls

hu90mxs,"Oh for sure that’s valid. I just think that was the intent. There’s also things like fiennes learning to embrace murder and the Victoria cross when he executes someone who was anti England. The anti-war/imperialism message is an absolute mess no doubt.

Like my interpretation of the film is that Vaughn is a nihilist and we’re watching a guy who’s anti imperialism learning “it’s okay sometimes” played straight. We have all our leads mourn the guy best known for concentration camps which were even shown in the film lol, so in my eyes it’s not so much whitewashing/sweeping things under the rug as it is the whole film showing why the empire is bad and then having the main character’s arc be embracing that then inviting king George onto his “above state” secret service named “kingsman”

I mentioned in another comment that this is a guy who made a pretty standard mob film about a “smart guy playing everyone and rising up the ranks” that has the climax, he becomes top dog, then gets shot out of the blue by a nothing character from earlier in the film. My interpretation is he doesn’t like any of the characters that are played heroically even. They’re played heroically but they’re very much shown in text doing terrible things and justifying concentration camps, film of contradictions for sure",rlvtls

hvezpz2,"There was no coordinated attack, once the Nazis had invaded and the polish government was already broken down and acting in exile, thats when the soviets moved in, yes, they still ended up fighting the remaining military structure that remained and im not going to say something crazy like ""no the soviets didnt invade poland"" but when they invaded, it was triggered by polands government collapsing and them seeing that opportunity to military expand so their border is secured further away from moscow, not because they were working together with the nazis, if they were working together and planning an invasion together you would imagine they would invade at the same time or within a closer timeframe than they really did.

There is historical context that implies to me that their coal was military presence closer to the Nazis with more distance from Moscow than motivation to divide up the lands with the Nazis, mainly the many attempts in getting polands permission to place soviet troops along the poland-german border, which poland would always reject stating that the allies would protect them if the germans did anything.",rlvtls
