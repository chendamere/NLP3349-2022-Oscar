gq4wbvt,"I'm not gonna touch on the story/world having the depth of a puddle or the paper-thin characters. But what even was the point of finding Sisu? She didn't do anything, just tagged along with Raya. She got new powers with each gem piece....and then she died and never used them to fight the monsters. Everything is solved by the humans putting the gem back together themselves. 

You can literally remove Sisu from the story and it doesn't change. Call it ""Raya's Journey"" or whatever. Raya travelling alone to collect the gem pieces. I mean she already knew where they were, she didn't even need Sisu to help her locate them.

Also I couldn't understand a single thing the big lunky dude was saying he was so mumbly and growly.",lyj52m
gpuyd7x,"Story would've worked better as a tv show. Events rush through and there's no build up to most of the emotional climaxes. 

Namaari clearly had an arc similar to Zuko from Avatar but it's so rushed it doesn't hit at all. The rest of the cast seems underexplored.

Also so much lore and setting that could be explored.

Beautiful movie though.",lyj52m
gq1inwi,"I feel like this movie would have been WAY better of Raya and Naamari had switched roles in the story. If we followed the daughter of Fang who betrayed Heart for the good of her clan, and in doing so broke the world.  She then goes on the quest to find Shishu and save the world. She gets to spend the movie making up for her mistake in a world that doesn't trust her.

The film's message about earning trust by giving it becomes a lot stronger if it's Naamari who sets aside her fear and her need to ""do what's right for my people"" and leaves the stone in Raya's hands.",lyj52m
gqrsm8s,"Are you kidding me? Hey kids, you know that person who keeps fucking you over? Yeah give em another shot. Like I 100% get the message as they lay into it pretty thick, but damn how many chances do people get?",lyj52m
gs06sot,"Y’all I can’t emphasize enough how the “trust” theme irked the living hell out of me. It’s one of those themes that is so overwhelmingly superficial, that it’s actually toxic in practice. And it bugs the bejesus out of me that kids could definitely take the message the wrong way.

No, you do not have to trust people who abuse you. Trust is EARNED, Disney, it’s not freely given. If someone repeatedly hurts you, you are not obligated to trust them “because it’s the right thing to do.” It made me super uncomfortable because that borders on some gaslighting, abusive nonsense. Maybe it’s just because of my life experience (work in law enforcement, survivor myself), but I seriously cringed at that because adults who prey on kids often use that sort of reasoning when grooming victims. It seriously bothered me to see it solidified in a Disney movie. 

Parents, please talk to your kids about what *healthy* trust looks like. Your kids are not obligated to trust someone who hurts them just because it’s “right” or because they want to fix something that’s broken. That’s not trust, that’s the start of toxic codependency and abuse.",lyj52m
gq4oj5y,"Overall a really beautiful looking movie and pretty decent. This movie had a lot of potential so i do feel a bit disappointed. IMO doesn't come near frozen or tangled in terms of overall story quality. I also enjoyed Moana is quite a bit more. 

**What I liked about the movie:**

obviously the animation. it was incredible. 

The dragon. Both awwqafina performance and the design grew on me. Didn't think at like any of it based on trailers but it worked.

The side characters. Another thing i thought Id hate based on the trailer. I actually really liked the side characters and wish they got more fleshed out. Except for the baby. not a fan of the whole 'baby that can move and think like an adult' but it also wasn't as annoying as I'd thought. 

Raya. Loved everything about raya. 

The fighting scenes. wish there were more of it. 

**My issues with the movie:**

tl;dr: Bad writing. fast pacing. poor dialogue. too cheezy and the writers forcing themselves into dumb plot. 

Everything about the beginning. It was soo cheesy, way more than usual. I cringed more than once and i typically don't cringe like that during disney animated movies. Also, I know that it pretty typical of disney to rush through the intrs so we can get to the main story quicker, but this one felt way too forced. Everything happened so quickly and there were too many plot holes for me to ignore. a couple small plot holes are easy to ignore but when there are too many it really takes you out of the movie. Everything to do with the crystal made no sense. If this thing is so important why does it have almost no security. Also its got to be in the most obvious place. How did none of the other tribes realize it was in the big ancient mystical looking building on the top of the mountain? And it has no roof. Not like it mattered since it security was non existent, but anyone could have just done what the chief did and come flying in through the roof. 

Next the scene where rayas father turns to stone. There is no reason he couldn't have gone into the river with her. He sits there talking to her for 2 minutes before yeeting her into the river. He could have easily (and it would have been safer for raya) if he held her and jumped into the river with her. I dont understand why he just accepted he needed to turn into stone there except for the fact that the movie needed it to move the plot forward. Also why the fuck didnt all those people on the bridge just jump into the river??  

Also, I think the movie could have had more exposition about the dragons and the evil cloud things at the start. 


My biggest issue though is probably the pacing of the movie and all the missed potential. Disney created and amazing world here, but we barely got to see any of it. Going to the 5 lands and collecting the crystals should have been an amazing adventure full of world building. But it seriously felt like we got 5 minutes in each land and collecting the crystals was sooo easy. If these crystal parts are so important how has nobody attempted to steal them before raya? would have been incredibly easy for fang to take all of them. This movie would have really worked better as a mini series or even just 30min longer. This story was too big and amazing to be 145min movie and it suffered for it.

 The side characters where surprisingly good. Flesh them out for christ sake. 2min of backstory is not fleshed out and i will not care for them. add 10+ of character development with worldbuilding and the movie improves. 

My next big issue is fang and namaari at the end. Fang just betrays and backstabs throughout the whole movie but at the end it all somehow ok ? they never made a real attempt to show that they had changed. Even at the end its no namaari that takes the leap of faith, it ray. namaari should have been the first one to turn herself into stone. The moral of the story? backstab everyone and somehow everything will work out for you. 

The scene where Sisu dies is so incredibly frustrating. Again i think this was really bad writing. Its so obvious they didn't want to have any real villain in this movie except for the evil spooky clouds, but the film really suffered so much for it. Its so dumb that the dragon fan girl points her crossbow at a fucking dragon. How does she not realize ""hmm the dragon I've idolized and looked up to my entire life is working with my enemy and they say they want to fix the world.. am i the bad guy here? should i listen to them ? should i not point my fucking crossbow and the fucking dragon and think about pulling the trigger ??"". Susis death was 90% on namaari and 10% on raya. You cant blame raya after the constant betrayals from fang and namaari. She brought the weapon so her plan from the start was to betray them and shoot somebody if she needed to. 

Just quick thought of how they could fix it: Raya and namaari meet and then namaari gives the crystal and Susi comes out. all the same up to this point. But then namaaris mother comes out because she was following namaari (after that super obvious firework signal) and takes all the dragon crystals. Namaari didnt know about this and feels betrayed by her mother. Namaari then saves raya and they work together to help Susi. In the end the mother realizes she made a mistake and sacrifices herself to save everyone.

 Then the writers would have to think of a reason why fang putting the crystals together and having Susi doesnt fix anything. Because according to the movie it should, but then the movie plot would fall apart (again bad writing). I know this is also cheezy but its not as bad as what they gave us.

also the WATER dragons not being able to defeat the evil clouds that are weak to WATER makes no sense. make some fog. make it rain. there's no reason the dragons died except that the plot required it. 

This is way longer then I thought it'd be. I doubt anyone will read all of it but it was nice to vent about it. Still a decent movie thats worth watching for the visuals.",lyj52m

gpuwtlc,"Overall I enjoyed the movie and there's no denying the animation was great but I'm a little disappointed in what I feel the story could've been, at least if it wasn't catered towards 6 year olds.

In the end, everyone, including the dead dragon, came back to life and there were seemingly no repercussions for anyone, including Fang. Happily ever after.

Just falls a little short for me compared to Avatar.

* Sisu the last dragon = Aang the last airbender.
* Raya = Katara, each lost her parent 5 yrs ago, is daughter of her nation's chief and is the responsible adult of their ragtag group trying to save the world.
* Namaari = Zuko, both pressured to do the wrong thing by their evil parent who rules their nation.
* Sisu believes in trust, which almost gets her killed by Namaari = Aang believes in pacifism which almost gets him killed by Fire Lord Ozai.
* Raya trusts Namaari ending in Sisu being shot dead = Katara trusts Zuko in Ba Sing Se and he stabs her in the back with Aang being shot dead.
* Raya goes to all the nations collecting a new gem piece (which comes with a dragon power) and teammate at each = Aang goes to all the nations collecting a bending discipline and teammate at each.",lyj52m
gpuapa3,"I can't get over how beautiful it was. I especially loved the shot of Raya hugging Sisu near the end, the dragon's fur is so incredible.

I had a wild fun time. The action was engaging. The characters were really likable. Awkwafina's Sisu grew on me really fast. Alan Tudyk's Tuk Tuk is a treasure.

I really like this quote from a [Polygon piece](https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2021/3/2/22309833/raya-and-the-last-dragon-dragon-design-disney):

> “The difference between an Eastern or Chinese dragon versus the Nāga is that a Chinese dragon is based on luck and power,” explains screenwriter Qui Nguyen. “And the Nāga, because it’s water, it’s life and hope. It’s just that slight little difference. We didn’t want a dragon that came in to empower [human protagonist] Raya to hit people more; we wanted one that would inspire her to open up and trust.”

and also

> With Raya, the cast and crew approached cultural specificity by integrating a plethora of understated details, small elements that weave together to the fabric of the world.

The world felt so alive, all the details were just so authentic and realistic. I really hope we get to see more of Kumandra in the future.",lyj52m

gpvld3q,So did no one catch when they went back to Heart and she said she didn’t realize the dragon statues were there? They were literally behind some vines???,lyj52m
gpvc7j2,"While I did like the visuals, music, and characters I feel the story itself is flawed. There’s absolutely no reason to trust Fang. We see time and time again that they’re selfish and betray others for their own gain. Yet the movie paints them as misunderstood and expects us to just blindly agree. Like, why on earth should Raya get the blame for killing Sisu when Naamari was pulling the trigger on her crossbow? There’s a difference between expecting the worst of people, and having multiple instances proving that a person WILL betray you. The message almost turns toxic, insinuating that you should accept people who keep hurting you. 

If they portrayed Fang as the most untrusting then it would give their nation more depth. Ie. “Heart must be selfishly hoarding food for themselves,” “Raya must be collecting the Dragon Gem pieces to keep for herself,” “Raya must be coming for revenge for her father so we need to stop her,” “Raya and Sisu might attack me so I should bring a weapon to defend myself,” etc.

Also, the Fang general mentioned that they need to expand. Why?? Fang is open-concept central! There’s so much open space! Is it because they need room for crops? herd animals for their cats? Too many people? It feels like a weird, unsupported thing they threw out there.

Finally, I found a lot of the “modern talk” a bit annoying. Especially after Sisu was awoken. I’m particularly not a fan of these kinds of jokes in fantasy movies since it’s just immersion breaking. Towards the end they simmered down and the movie was better for it",lyj52m
gq1t19c,Namaari literally was gaslighting everyone after killing Sisu. She was literally squeezing the trigger as she pointed it at Sisu. Causing an apocalypse and seeing what she caused. Then she claims she didn't mean it despite showing all the intentions of shooting Sisu. THEN SHE BLAMES EVERYONE ELSE INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING WHAT SHE DID AND APOLOGIZE.

gpwg015,"I feel like everyone talking about the SFX in this movie might be because we're all avoiding the elephant in the room here.... the writing. This movie had its moments, but MAN you could tell this was not a Pixar movie. So much cringe writing, I chuckled a few times, but within 5 minutes of meeting Sisu, I was really tired of that character. She got less grating eventually but would still have really annoying moments. I usually like Awkwafina but this was like Awkwafina concentrate.   


It was also just incredibly predictable, and I usually don't \*really\* have a problem with that and I don't usually try to predict where movies will go, but this was just so predictable it stood out for me.   


The use of tons of modern slang felt really awkward too. It'll date this movie unlike maybe any animated Disney movie I've seen before. I can't think of any examples at the moment, but it just had lingo in there that, 20 years from now, will stick out like a sore thumb. Nobody watching Toy Story is thinking ""oh God I remember when we used to say that"". Maybe a nitpick, but that's the type of shit you usually see in other animated movies that use top 10 radio songs as their soundtrack.   


Overall I enjoyed it, but definitely not a new classic for me. It had that potential, with the ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" kind of story of uniting the tribes, but it didn't nail it. Like another commenter said, this might have been better served as a series where we didn't spend literally 5 minutes tops in any given tribe locale.",lyj52m

gq5obfg,"They packed in **so much** into this one movie, it really could've been a series. The world, music and visuals were the key highlights but I wish they could've slowed down to explore it a lot more because the characters and story could've used some additional polish. Instead, we're darted from one location to the next to push the narrative forward without much development. 

From Tangled onwards, this would probably be my least favourite non-sequel Disney Animations computer-animated movie. Oddly enough, it mostly worked for me, though there are clearly some holes along the way. I've seen comments about how it's like Avatar but it feels more like Korra.",lyj52m
gq5u6sk,"Movie was okay, really nice visuals and raya was likable and belivably badass, it was kinda rushed and the different places was interesting but we never got a real look at any of them. Watched it with my Filipina gf, they could have done better with the representation of the cultures, its just a mish mush of south east asian things which we felt was a bit half way and out of context. Mulan and Frozen did better on that front. Also the voice actors being almost all east asian is wierd. Its like, either you find people that represent the cultures you are depicting or you hire the best actor for the Job. You dont go half way.

gpudpvt,"The visuals looks pretty good, the scenery, the dragons, and the characters designs all are work for me, especially the scenery, this movies took us to the places with varieties, from dessert, floating market, tundra, and Fang's canal, all of them looks visually colorful and stunning.

I think the fighting scene is one of the best fighting scenes in animated movies, it was looks so fluid and dynamic, especially fighting scenes with Namaari in tundra and Fang Castle.

I like that this movie is about Trust and in the final scene Raya beliieve Naamari to trust the magic, and finally she learnt her lesson to trust someone in critical moment, I think complete the arc about her to trust someone again.

gqevhhj,"What if the druuns are actually the good guys. When Raya's father is awoken, his leg wound is magically healed. Maybe the druun turning people to stone is a cocoon to heal humans of all ailments, possibly including death, thus taking a long time.

gqowhtk,"The film's ""trust"" theme was all over the place. Made no sense. It went on and on about ""we should trust each other"" yet, throughout the whole film, the only thing that anyone ever got punished for was trust. Why?

Things also went *way* too fast. Felt like it should have been at least an hour longer. I mean think about that old lady. She got introduced as a nice old lady, revealed to be a ruthless leader in a super fast twist, and disappeared from the film after challenging the protagonist and providing the macguffin, all within what felt like 3 minutes tops. No build-up to anything, no raising of the stakes, no setting up of the conflict. Wham bam thank you ma'am. Chapter closed. On to the next kingdom or whatever.

That weird, hollow and uninspired story had one spectacular visual shell though. A magnificent achievement in CGI. Very well done. Except the dragons, which looked too much like my little pony stuff. But that was more of an ""awful taste but great execution"" type deal.

After the trailers I was 100% expecting to hate the baby, but was very pleasantly surprised. She and her monkeys were surprisingly adorable. And that chase scene when she's first introduced was fantastic.

Tong was a super pointless character, whose only addition to the plot was being one of the bearers of the macguffin. He was part of the protagonist's band, without contributing anything meaningful. Take him out, nothing changes. A shameful waste of a perfectly good Benedict Wong.

grusr1v,"The backstory for this movie was complete nonsense.

So the Druun appears, for some reason never explicitly stated. It turns people into stones in a specific pose, for no reason ever stated, EXCEPT WHEN IT DOESN'T AT THE END, because this movie doesn't care about consistency.

The humans fight this and gets their ass kicked. The dragons ""help,"" even though it's not really helping insomuch as it is ""well, WE don't want to turn to stone either."" Whatever they're doing, it's not working, so the remaining ones, minus Sisu, combine their power. They don't make Sisu help because.... either her power's not useful, since it's apparently swimming good, or they somehow figure that swimming good is too important to put into a stone.

So they put all their magic in the stone, give it to Sisu, and then... lets themselves be turned to stone, for some reason...?

Bear in mind that even just pieces of this stone is enough to repel the Druun, yet they apparently can't use it and so instead figure, ""Welp, guess we'll die.""

The Druun is apparently made of human discord, and there wasn't any of that for the entire history of humankind until the backstory of the movie took place. They're also apparently weak to water, yet none of the dragons, who're literally stated to be the source of rain, figure that they should rain on them. Also, apparently they'll keep stoning people until the world is completely fucked and everything has been destroyed. I guess even though they've been created from humans, they don't need them to survive? And they're apparently the opposite of dragons, which would imply humans made dragons, too?

So the dragons made the stone by combining their magic, which dispelled the Druun until the stone was broken. That begs the question, why the hell didn't they do something like that to begin with? Did they not know what they were doing?

And back to the dragons dying, they were standing in a spot surrounded by water, which was surrounded by Druun. The Druun are shown to try and pass the water, but failing. Except once the stone has been given to Sisu, they're apparently perfectly capable of passing the water, and the dragons just stand there and let themselves be petrified, meanwhile the Druun ignore Sisu who is right next to them. Then Sisu uses the stone and it destroys the Druun and turns the humans back from stone, but for some reason not the dragons. And Sisu says it could've been any of them who used the stone, so why didn't they just do it? And why did she let them be turned to stone before she used it? Why did they let themselves be turned to stone? Nothing about it makes any damn sense. And why did Sisu go to sleep? It's never explained. Nothing in this movie is ever explained. All we ever get is vague fluff about ""trust""

gpu0voi,"While I enjoyed the movie and loved the score, I can’t help but wonder if it would’ve been better as a musical. That might’ve provided the opportunity to flesh out the side characters and smooth out the pacing as Team Raya traveled to each land.

The humor worked. I know people were resistant about the jokes in the trailer for sound too modern but it worked for this world.",lyj52m
gpua4ij,"Eh idk. It was gorgeously animated but overall it felt kinda hollow. It reminded me a lot of Avatar: The Last Airbender (like a lot a lot, make human Sisu the protagonist and it’s the same goddamn thing lol), except the characters weren’t as fleshed out. I definitely preferred Moana, which is another movie that it shares similarities with.",lyj52m
gptagq6,"There's a lot of pretty good stuff here, especially the relationship between Raya and Namaari. Of course the visuals are phenomenal, and the score is outstanding.

Unfortunately, there's also a lot that really drags it down. The whole conflict is very ""just don't think about it"" and it falls apart the moment you question the characters' actions. There's a lot of rather repetitive fluff, attempting to build up on a theme that ends up being kind of half-hearted.

I appreciate the attempt to show many different and distinct locations, but the worldbuilding ends up being pretty flat for a film that really wants you to appreciate the world and culture in display. I really, really wish the sidequests could have been straight up removed so the plot could focus on what really matters, the arc with the protagonist and the antagonist. The final confrontation between Raya and Namaari is really good, but I struggled to really care after a lot of meandering and a very, very predictable resolution.

At least Awkwafina didn't ruin the movie like I feared she would.",lyj52m

gptg4uy,"Could have been fooled this was directed by Tarantino given how many feet shots are in.

Joke aside, this is a good movie, maybe the studio's most action packed to date. The landscapes are gorgeous and the water animation is definetely the quality that was teased with that broken damn in Frozen 2. Some shots are breathtaking and i genuinely forgot i watched animation at some point.


Of course due to the runtime we don't get much time with some side characters, so don't expect big character development from them.
Even so, I enjoyed the humour and mostly well timed, as for the story beats, the climax while predictable and maybe a bit fast, is nice enough.",lyj52m
gqaszyg,"PROS:

1.) I really love Raya as a character and I love her design. And her voice actress did a really awesome job and that makes me happy after what happened with Star Wars.

2.) I really, really enjoyed the world-building. I feel like there's a ton they could do with a sequel if they're willing to go deeper with it. 

3.) I enjoyed parts of the ending that actually defied my expectations. I loved how they left it up to the ""villain"" to fix the problem.

4.) Very excellent animation!

5.) Alan Tudyk played Tuk Tuk in this and Hei Hei in Moana. Bruh.

CONS:

1.) A lot of over the top humor killed what should've been emotional moments for me. 

2.) The baby and the moneys and the big guy didn't need to be in it. The baby especially was just used for cheap humor that wasn't really even funny. In my opinion!

3.) A lot of cliche moments.

4.) Too many characters, many of which were unnecessary. 

For a sequel I would enjoy seeing them introduce some darker elements and an antagonistic dragon. I believe this universe has *a lot* of potential if they can get the tone of it right.",lyj52m

gpun21j,"I enjoyed it for the amazing visuals, fun characters (the puppy line for example), and cool action choreography, but the story was all style over substance.

Like...they have a top secret vault without a *ceiling in it*? Really? And they only have two security guardians--one of whom is what, only twelve or thirteen before the time-skip?--for the most valuable artifact in the whole world that armies are willing to mobilize for? Again...*really*?

And the whole movie was filled with stuff like this. Sisu can be revived just cause. They can put together the broken gem without Sisu just 'cause of the power of friendship and trust--never mind that Raya was right and that trusting people would have got them killed multiple times. The Druun are repelled by water and the freaking dragon with the ability to make it rain can't drive them back just 'cause.  The dragons had been supposedly fighting these guys to the bitter end, then the last five of them combine their powers to banish them...they really couldn't have done that sooner?

Me neither.

This movie drove me bananas. Every single line felt like it was read from a teleprompter at an empowerment seminar. There was no depth or development of any of the characters. I found myself eye rolling and checking my watch more than once. Also this might be an unpopular opinion but... I’m starting to get annoyed with the idea that apparently all female characters need to be ass kicking superhero warriors with absolutely no physical weakness, desire for romantic love of any kind, or even a sense of humor. I thought Raya was so one dimensional that I have no sense of her personality except “boring badass.”

gpv6qe3,"It was okay. The movie looked absolutely breathtaking, the music was excellent and the action great, but the story felt too formulated for me. It doesn't give us time to get attached to the myriad of characters they introduce, and we only jump places to places without feeling the urgence of the situation. OK, the purple-thing is terrible and means end of the world, but we only see it twice in the movie? Its threat is mostly explained then shown. There's a lot of exposition throughout the movie that was unnecessary.

Also, there's a lot of unanswered question. Why are the statues positioned like that? Why some statues are not? Why does Sisu is revived when the dragons come back? Also, the main message of ''we have to trust each other'' is pretty much undermined by the multiple occasions where it's proven that WE SHOULDN'T.

Also, I can't get over the dragons design. It's My Little Pony all over again, but uglier.

But Namaari betrays Raya twice, then her and Sisu fault Raya for not trusting her? Not to mention Sisu's behind had to be saved because she trusted the old lady when she shouldn't have, so she should know you can't go around trusting everybody.

In fact after the rest of them turn to stone doesn't Namaari try to run away with the gem shards *again*? Only when she collapses because she doesn't have the energy to make it up the debris and leave the cave does she turn back and put the pieces together to help them.

gt9y2b6,"Spoiler warning: Huge Disney fan here, also from SEA myself. Was excited about the trailer some and had mixed expectations. I finally got around to watch it and uh... It hits me wrong in so many areas, some which already shown itself from the trailer.  
\- The search for Sisu felt rushed. I was like wow that was fast with all the time skip, and felt effortless. It is odd.  
\- Sisu barely did anything throughout the entire movie...? She's cute. Awkwafina did great voicing her otherwise.  
\- Biggest issue I have is Namaari, the way the movie allowed her to get away with looting and murder, and deserve to be trusted is baffling. It also shows how Sisu trusting the wrong person caused her own death so maybe that's something.. Namaari walked out with 0 consequences of her action, that is just not okay. It also shows how messed up it is that she wouldn't have worked with Raya or the 'good side' if not for her admiration and respect for Sisu, since Raya alone wouldn't have been enough.   
\- A lot of acting choices in the animation and writing of the dialogues kind of rubbed me wrong. They are extremely westernized in a rather artificial way, like they just didn't belong in this universe.  
\- Baby character is kind of uncanny. She's a baby, but clearly doesn't behave like one.   
\- The Spine Tribe getting completely petrified was unfortunate, was hoping to see more cultural highlights.  
\- They had longan fruits in the movie, but completely missed the chance to make a joke on it?? And it's a movie about Dragon???? (for those that don't know, a longan fruit is called Dragon Eye because it looked a bit like an eye ball).  
\- Martial art part felt rushed, could have choreographed better. Asian movies fight scenes can be pretty epic.  


It's a step towards making more movies base on other culture, so I don't dislike it entirely. Just had higher expectations than usual.

gugvfa8,"Unfortunately for me it felt like all of these tropes and story beats had been done before, and much more effectively, in much better productions (like Avatar, LOK, She-Ra etc). We kept pointing out bits that were very similar, but worse. Namarii was Zuko if there ever was a Zuko. But at least Zuko had an arc. Namarii's change of heart was literally down to the fact that she...also likes dragons?

The mum's influence was undershown, underplayed, underdeveloped, and unsatisfactory ultimately. What's the point of having nuanced villainous characters who attempt to exploit any power they can, if you don't engage with that viewpoint head on and have some kind of comeuppance to show how that way of thinking is bad? And they had the bones of nuance there (with the poverty, and then success, the greater good, isolationism etc)- they just didn't do anything with it! Literally nowt happened to the mum. It would have been much more effective to make the Druun the supposed villain (because as main villain they suuuucked) - but have a reveal that it is Namarii's mother that they also have to face down (or a confrontation between Namarii and her mother that faces down that ideology) . Whole message and lesson falls flat otherwise.

The relationship between Raya and her dad was weak. The writing and screen transitions were weak. Nothing had a point. None of the characters or realms were fleshed out enough for me to care. No one had any character development. Sisu felt out of context with the world, and the whole dragon thing felt meh because it was so rushed. Generally just a big dull dud, which was a real shame because as someone who adores stuff like this - and from reviews- I had high hopes!

Don't know if anyone else felt this - but the obvious ""flirty banter"" between Raya and Namarii felt like queer baiting that they weren't going to actually commit to. You can't claim to be being ""revolutionary"" - and then reduce it to ""awww I thought its cos you MISSED me"" and some hair touching, lingering hands, and longing looks. Fuck sake.

The Druun being nothing more than smoke that turn people to stone is so weak. What were they? What was their goal. Where did they come from. The Druun are so  boring and only there as a plot device without any real depth.

The whole plot of 4 McGuffins is also really boring. Go here take crystal. Go here take crystal. It's so basic, and so easy. Running around the map and getting the crystals and it wasn't even that difficult to get them.

For me one of the major drawbacks of the film were the side characters.  I didn't find them endearing and barely tolerated their presence throughout the film.

It has a good message but poor execution. The characters are forgettable  with little personality, especially Raya who lacked charisma.

It’s very possible the production of this film suffered due to the pandemic, with different teams working on it remotely.

Namaari just has nothing better to do than chase the princess of a dead nation? What’s more, If Namaari knew Raya was collecting dragon shards, why take a platoon to intercept her at Spine at all? You know she will have to come to Fang to get that one anyway. 

When Sizu and the dragons created the gem to stop the big bad, none of the dragons returned from stone and Sizu disappeared for 500 years. Why doesn’t anyone disappear the second time the gem is forged/why does everyone come back when no one did the first time??

Did no one really have a theory about the appearance of the big bad when the gem shattered and how reassembling it might make them go away again in SIX YEARS and entire families being turned to stone??

Why would Namaari agree to meet Rayah at the start of act 3 if she’s just going to pull out the crossbow and go for the “dragon comes with me” angle? Couldn’t she just go to the Queen of Fang and an entire platoon of Fang soldiers comes at them to capture Sizu and the gem shards rather than one crossbow armed princess?

gq45go6,"Like everyone else says, the movie was absolutely stunning and the artists, composers, animators are at the top of their game.

The writing was lazy though and the lack of character development ruined the film for me. It really bothers me because the potential that this movie had to be another amazing animated feature was really wasted. It seemed like Disney kind of set their bar for the next age of movies with Moana. Compared to Moana, this film was a disorganized jumble of loose ideas. The dialogue of all the side characters was used for incredibly low-effort jokes instead of any development. Whenever they wanted you to connect with one of the side characters they turned on the sad music and had them talk about losing their family. Otherwise, they really had no development throughout the movie. In Moana, we got Maoi. Maoi was a flawed character, he went through an arc, and by the end his story was memorable and it felt like it beautifully tied into the message of the movie and Moana's own journey. In this movie, the story just ended with three gimmicks: kid with high self-esteem, stealing baby, and tough softie. A closer example of character development done right is Mulan. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po are characters that go through an arc, and the viewer bonds with them through the course of the film even though at the start they seemed like three total loonies. The difference is that every scene in Mulan, every shot, serves a purpose to drive the characters and the story forward.

The amount of unrelated or extraneous information in Raya that doesn't develop the characters or the story is unusually high for Disney and it makes for a less enjoyable movie than it could have been. The scene where she returns the amulet, the scene where Fang is explaining their space problems, the scenes of each of them going through their plans to return the amulet, etc. This time where they could just show Bangs Girl in her room feeling conflicted and then the amulet appears on the window sill or taking out a good twenty minutes of banter would have saved a ton of time for the real messages of the movie.

Don't keep writing lines for Raya that say ""I have trust issues"" SHOW US THAT RAYA HAS TRUST ISSUES!!! You have the best 3D animators in the world working for you, use them!! We go straight from dialogue about how she hates the people in the water town to her hiring the baby that just stole from her to get one of the gem pieces that she is staking her father's life on. It totally removes Raya's personality and issues from the story and makes it more predictable.

There is way too much of the characters talking about the themes of the story in this film. You don't need Maoi or Moana telling you their issues, because that's not all that they are. They're characters who come to life on the screen and behave like real human beings. Their issues are deep and they're just doing their best to work through them. If someone walked around saying they had trust issues they probably wouldn't have trust issues. They would just try harder to trust people. I would expect Raya to only rely on other characters only when she has no other choice, to not trust others where some people may fall for empathy, and to try to keep everyone at a distance so she's not at risk of being hurt again. Instead, Raya immediately connects with anyone who shows some sign that they've experienced what she has and trusts them with things that are super important to her.

It's not like she's consistently punished or rewarded for placing trust though, sometimes it's shown as a really good thing, and then in the next scene, it does her in. It would have been nice to see her consistently not trusting others no matter what they've been through, but through conflict being forced to expand her circle and boundaries bit by bit until she reaches the final person that there's no way she could ever forgive and giving that trust leads to the world being saved and Raya overcoming the scars of her past. Someone else made the point that she just keeps putting trust in people who hurt her and it's almost a negative message that you should keep harmful people in your life just because it's the ""right thing to do"".

These are just my thoughts but it's really just me venting about what the movie could have been. For people who write stories, Disney has always been an inspiration with each story they tell. To see one that feels so far from their best is discouraging. Is this what qualifies for a success in the market today?  


TLDR: The movie was amazing in every aspect but the writing. The characters weren't as strong as they should have been and the plot was disjointed but it was still a fun watch.",lyj52m

gq8437d,"Honestly it was a very fun ride and as an animation nerd, this movie takes every opportunity to flex how far 3D animation has come. I ate it up.

From a writing/story standpoint I found it kind of lacking, but that may be a limitation of it being a movie and not a TV series and being for kids. It felt like it was trying so hard to be Avatar: The Last Airbender and Lord of the Rings.

I feel like they could have thrown in two sentences that would've made the emotional impact of the movie hit so much harder. The man from Fang who lost everything just decided to help when there is zero motivation for his character to do that. Raya literally could have looked him in the eye and said something like ""I know what it's like to lose family defending my home"" and that would have been genuine and connected these characters and given him motivation for helping. The antagonist girl also just missed the emotional payoff by never realizing the theme of the movie by trusting everyone. She kind of just messed up but things worked out. She never even said she was sorry to show any kind of growth. It really felt like Suisoo was once again punished for trusting someone and then the movie never truly showed that trust prevailed. Kind of just seem like magic did.

Ok rant over. Would love to see more of this world.",lyj52m

It makes no sense why no one apart from Raya is seeking the parts of the gem, not even Her rivals mother until she suggests that they use it and sisu to expand. It also felt like for something so important that raya simply infiltrated every nation and basically walked away Scot free without any real danger or threat...the characters would conveniently escape every single time... Terrible plot.",lyj52m
gq73t0s,"My opinion of this is that the movie was kinda eh. Visually, I think it looks fantastic. The environments, clothing, and other visual details all look beautiful. Storywise, I found the movie rather shallow. There's a lot that happens in a relatively short runtime, and there's not a lot time to get to know the characters all that well as a result. The movie basically feels like a ""Go here and get the thing"" fetch quest, with none of the lands of this world really being particularly fleshed out or made interesting. This is also kind of a personal thing, but I really didn't find this movie funny. Disney's not been a stranger to this kind of humor in the past, but I feel other movies have done it better or at least minimized it to a level I don't find as offensive. This movie is just full of really juvenile humor, and I don't think I really laughed at a single joke. I think what killed it for me was the baby. I get it's a kids' movie, but I really feel it pushed my own personal limits for this kind of juvenile humor. I also was not a fan of Sisu or the role she plays in the movie's lesson about trust. I hate her design, for one. Everyone and their mother has said that she looks like dragon Elsa at this point, and it's very true. Could they not have picked a better design for her? Asian dragons can look pretty interesting and badass. Why was this frankly kind of ugly design the one they went with? There was also something about Awkwafina's performance I didn't dig. I suppose she did a decent job, but she's arguably my least favorite performance in the movie. My biggest issue with the movie is really the trust message, however. I don't dislike the movie's message on principle. But the movie basically just tells you that blind trust is a great idea. Raya has every reason not to trust Namaari after she betrayed it prior and basically destroyed Raya's entire people in the process. And Namaari has never done anything to prove that she's worthy of Raya's trust or forgiveness since. Sisu's blind trust in people is also consistently met with failure. And yet it's Raya who is consistently shamed for not being willing to trust Namaari or being suspicious of people in general. And at the climax of the movie, for some reason Raya opts to trust the person who has already betrayed her twice. Now, I'm not saying you should never trust anyone ever. But blind trust is unbelievably naive, and it really bugs me that this is the broken sort of message the movie is advocating for. Overall, I think this movie is a 6/10. Pretty animation, decent performances, pretty weak story.",lyj52m
gpvrfgq,"This will probably get downvoted to hell, but I feel like some people here are misreading the ‘trust’ theme a bit.

Yes, there was no reason to trust Fang at all. When Raya decides to ‘take the first step’ at the end, she knows Fang are a bunch of bastards and Namaari will still likely screw her over anyway, but she does it anyway. Not because she’s suddenly drunk on the ‘trust everyone’ kool-aid, but because she’s learned that the only way to salvage an important relationship that’s been broken is for *someone* to be a goddamn selfless hero about it and trust the other side again first, despite knowing full well they might get boned by the other party for taking the risk.

It wasn’t fair to Raya that she had to trust that shithead Namaari to save the world. That’s what made Raya’s decision courageous.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk


Edit: Also, the supposedly ‘evil’ queen of Fang you all keep saying should be lynched only wanted to steal the gems and dragon so that Fang could save everyone turned to stone themselves and therefore avoid being punished for their earlier mistake.

gpvq1wa,"I enjoyed it a lot even if I felt the pacing and some of the writing felt off. It's also a really beautiful looking movie, despite having some scenes that looked like the environment felt too small.

And I think all the characters are good but would have benefitted from more development which is definitely an easier said than done type of thing. But when they're on the boat thinking about the people they've lost and got turned to stone, it's a quiet moment that I think worked well. It really speeds through to get there but that little pause is nice. And I thought the ending was well done with Raya turning to stone first. For me personally it didn't feel like a deus ex machina but a very human moment of having to trust each other. Which is a very Disney lesson but that scene worked for me. It's kind of surprising how much I liked the whole third act. Usually that's were animated movies kind of drag for me.

And it's really silly but I really liked seeing what Vietnamese things that brought to the story. Simple things like Raya calling her dad ""ba"" and Raya saying Namaari is ""dep la."" I get excited for that stuff! And hopefully other South East Asian countries got some of that too. If anything I wish there was more of that.",lyj52m
gqb5hpu,"My general opinions on the movie have been covered in this thread, but there's one thing I haven't seen anybody mention. In this day and age, I can't believe they made a movie featuring a whole nation of people obsessed with cats and then...*barely* used the damn cats. 

We only saw the Fang warriors riding mean-looking cats as mounts...no cute kittens, no funny moments of cats doing cat things like hiding in boxes or getting startled or whatever. They could easily have included some background cats in the scenes where Namaari and her mother are walking around talking, for example. I'm not even a big cat person, but doesn't that seem like a huge wasted opportunity?! It would have been more fun than the baby and the monkeys, at least.",lyj52m
gpv2yhu,"I want to start off by saying that this movie is absolutely stunning. I distinctly remember randomly looking at the background of one of the beginning scenes in Heart and just seeing some almost photo-realistic foliage. Not to mention the settings in the other body parts, specifically Talon, with its beautiful array of colors and buildings. The few fights this movie had, especially that last one, were also great visually.

The main plot is a standard fetch-quest for pieces of some Dragon Ball that are all separated between the regions. Not exactly exciting, but allows for different locales and isn’t the end-all-be-all for me.

The characters had good interactions but it felt as though none besides Raya really had an arc. Sisu is almost killed for blindly trusting someone, which should’ve been an eye-opening experience, but in the end that naivety is supposedly a good thing.

Speaking of blind trust, Namaari stabbed Raya in the back, _twice,_ but then is just supposed to be forgiven? Don’t even get me started on her line that says her and Raya are equally responsible for what happened with Sisu’s death, such bull.

Overall, beautiful movie with fun characters, but a lack of those characters developing and the climax being as cheese as it was left a bad taste in my mouth.

gpy0pio,"For all the things I loved about this movie, the one glaring problem I have with it, that ate at me throughout the entire runtime, was the moral. It was honestly awful.

Most morals in this type of media are meant to be and able to be applied to a real life situation. Lion King? Embrace your truth. Ratatouille? You can do whatever you put your mind to. Mulan? Everyone has the power to be a hero.

Raya? Trust people...

That's the gist of it. Despite your inhibitions, your history, your fears, no matter how warranted they are, just trust people.

That's no lesson anyone living on this planet should be taught, lol. What's a more valuable, and true moral theme is that, not everyone is worthy of your trust. Not everyone is good. 

This theme only really can be applied to an idealized world, because only in an idealized world will a mindset like this yield fruit.

What's bizarre is, before it finally pays off in the end, the film proves several times that blind trust is *not* a safe way to live. Its proven by the dragons when they sacrifice themselves, then by Raya when she trusts the little girl from Fang Clan, then by Raya again, when she trusts the infant, by Sisu when she trusts the clan chief.

And when Raya makes the leap, to trust her enemy, and is presented with a crossbow to the face, we're supposed to see her as wrong when she responds negatively to that? ""I wasn't going to shoot you, you're also at fault for what happened to Sisu!""

What? *What?*

This, coming from the woman who's been hunting you, and is responsible for the greatest betrayal of your life, which resulted in the apocalypse? Right, lol.",lyj52m

gpu3q9s,"Note:  Disney is absolutely complicit with regards to the atrocities in China, but Asian representation isn't ""CCP propoganda"".",lyj52m
gqbnyam,"While I very much enjoyed Raya's animation and world design, and I will give props to the animators and artists for putting genuine effort into fleshing out the intricacies of the detail within the world that surrounded the characters, I feel that as a *film,* the movie's storyline and writing faltered for me. Especially with how it conveyed its themes. Throughout the film, Raya's journey is centered around her relationship with Sisu, and her character arc revolves around her natural distrust of people, whether it be Namaari or coming to terms with confiding in people as a whole, and it's a running theme that panders to Raya as she journeys from kingdom to kingdom. While the theme of coming to terms with trusting the people in our lives is a healthy message, and trust is genuinely important for mutual understanding, I feel that Raya actively subverted its own theme, and I feel it was lost in translation. Time and time again, we see that at the beginning of the film, Raya's blind trust in Namaari, a girl she had just met from Fang- a traditionally enemy kingdom to Heart, was the catalyst behind the fragmenting of the Dragon Gem, which broke her entire people as the Druun were unleashed upon Heart, petrifying the entire kingdom, including Raya's father while driving Kumandra into isolation. We're shown that as far as Namaari is concerned, it doesn't end here for Raya, and she continues to relentlessly pursue Raya and Sisu throughout the entire film's events, not really coming around to being a benevolent character until suddenly at the end of the film, where the two women manage to set aside their mutual distrust in order to save Fang and the rest of the world from the Druun, the embodiments of ""human discord"" (something we're told and not expounded on beyond that).

My problem with the translation of the theme is that it unintentionally preaches an underlyingly healthy message of blind trust. This is mainly translated in how the film consistently seems to shame and antagonize Raya for her distrust in Namaari and others, whether it be Sisu's lambasting of Raya for being trepidatious toward the people around her, or when we're shown how Sisu's defining trait seems to be her fervent blind trust within others, which consistently has disastrous consequences for her such as when she's cornered by the old woman at the Talon village for her Dragon Gem fragment, after being quick to let the old woman lead her on. My point is that while it's not a bad message to teach the importance of having a healthy level of trust in order to understand other people's side of the story, it became a problem when the film at every turn justified Raya's distrust through Namaari's two betrayals of her in the film, relentless hunting of Raya, and Sisu's repeat failures within how she confides in people regardless of the circumstances. It's a message that fumbles into how it's presented in the film, which I felt gave the impression of the film trying to say that ""Despite the grievances, pain, or abuse that others may cause you, it is wrong to let distrust of those people consume you, regardless of how much others have hurt you. Impartial forgiveness is the best forgiveness"" when Raya was justified in distrusting a woman that did nothing but harm her.

Even during the confrontation at Fang in the film's climax, Raya is convinced to settle for trusting in Namaari to unite the Dragon Gems, but Namaari yet again backstabs her despite her finally settling her distrust aside for once, ending in an altercation where a crossbow bolt is accidentally sent through Sisu. This is another example of how I feel the film worked against its own message because if anything, it presented a theme in showing the consequences of blind trust while antagonizing Raya for her vulnerabilities and completely natural distrust of Namaari when the audience is given nothing but reason to see why. Namaari doesn't truly atone or show any real remorse for her actions up until the end of the movie when the stakes of the situation concerning the Druun become cataclysmic, pressing Namaari and Raya into finally settling their differences. I felt Namaari's ""redemption"" at the end was rather shallow, and it wasn't truly earned in a meaningful way. She shows no real introspection toward her betrayals, until the consequences of her actions come upon her, without any real natural development given in the way of recourse for Namaari's change of heart. The film was overall a 6/10 for me, and while I enjoyed the animation and artistry, I didn't care for how the theme was translated, the film's antagonization of Raya for having very real, human vulnerabilities, and how quickly the film jumped between kingdom to kingdom, without really giving time to expound upon the world or these places, or build upon the side characters that are constantly joining Raya on her mission, without much depth as to their motivations beyond small mentions, which made them come across as shallow. They had essentially felt goons that we're supposed to care about, but given no reason to truly do so, and I felt the film could have used a tighter cast in that regard.

Raya is ultimately a beautifully animated but flawed film, and the film's principle should have been presented in a more nuanced manner. If anything, the film sabotaged its own principles that it tried to teach the audience.",lyj52m

So here’s the Dragonquest X plot:

In a faraway land, there was a big kingdom consisted of six races, the ogres, dwarves, elves, merpeople, flower, and dragon people. The dragon people were protected by a dragon god and many small dragons. But they were always at war with each other because the dragon people were always waging war with the others. One day, the other five races decided to kill the dragon god to punish the dragon people for being mean and untrustworthy. They divided the body of the dragon into five pieces sealed into crystals, and the dragon people were separated into tribes as well: the head, claws, wings, spine, and tail. As such, they started to isolate themselves from each other and started waging war against other dragon tribes. The leader of the tribe who holds the crystal for the head started to scheme; he wanted to collect all the dragon crystals so that he could control all the tribes. Meanwhile, a small water dragon disguised as a human named Fina from the tail tribe, stays watch over their crystal. She is the only one who knows the entire story, and keeps her temple and people safe from the purple malice that corrupts others as she had sealed her tribe underwater.  Your quest as a hero is to connect all the dragon tribes and banish the purple malice that is corrupting everyone’s hearts leading them to mistrust one another.

**Direction**

I knew it was going to be bad in the very first seconds of the movie when teen Raya starts explaining what is happening on screen (""I know what you're thinking, a lone rider-""), before we even have time to visually absorb what is time to happen on screen. Then it jumps to a noisy new visual explaining the backstory of the world, which jumps back to adolescent Raya's backstory, which *then* returns to the original teen Raya scene. From there are a series of poorly spaced scenes for character direction, poorly directed action scenes, and poorly paced comedic scenes (where the director basically lets Akwafina go off for a few seconds too long and it's supposed to serve as a punch line). 

There are a few beautiful moments in the film that slow things down enough for the magic to breathe and the scene to work (Sissu's first dragon rain dance, Raya's prayer, the self-sacrifice of the main characters at end) but they were too few and the connecting tissue too poorly constructed. Even good direction would only have helped a bit here because the second issue was

**World Building and Writing**

Did anyone else even lived in Heart besides Raya and her dad? Did she miss them too? Did she felt like a citizen of Heart? Where were all the people Tail? Do Spine, Talon, and Fang also consist of a single village? Did they want to unite and join, or were they happy as independent states for the last 500 years? Was Raya's dad's big plan to unite inviting them for food and giving a terrible speech? In the end, is there going to be some emperor or central government to formally unite the land and - oh look dragons! 

Outside of Talon none of the lands felt anywhere near lived in or real. They had lazy color schemes and basic landscape distinctions but only mildly expressed cultural differences. I get the issue with run time for a movie, but you look at a Wreck or Ralph or Moana or even Frozen and you get a much better sense of believable fantasy world building than this mess.

And this all before you even hit

**Themes**

The movie was dead set in convincing you to trust people, even people who have directly broken your trust numerous times. That's a bad message. Bad for handling relationships. Bad for international diplomacy. Bad in general. Yet the movie double and triples down on it by somehow making blind trust that someone who has displayed they do not earn your trust as the good ideal (dad and Sissu). It also makes Raya's character growth a mess, because she 1. starts off skeptical and non-trusting, 2. then she trusts someone based on his advice, 3. *which results in them being turned to stone*, 4. then becomes skeptical... again, 5. only to save the day in the end by blindly trusting the same person who has directly betrayed her a *second* time by this point. 

A much better film would have handled this with more nuance that allowed for clearer growth. Start with a trusting, naive Raya and a skeptical dad. Have her ignore dad's warnings and it leads to the same disaster in film. This then changes her to be cold and non-trusting - even to Sissu and her new allies on the boat. Slowly she learns to trust them again because they have earned it through their actions. Then give Fang girl a proper redemption arc to make the two stories collide.

The baby con artist. The village lady who trapped sisu.  The trap with the torture guy. The cross bow thing. These are all like exactly the same. 

Also the motivation for the mom wanting to hide/steal the gems made no sense. They undoubtedly lost people to the druun, but instead she just wants to “keep her people safe”? Makes absolutely no sense

Also the sequence of Raya angrily walking through Fang as all hell breaks loose to battle Namari was amazing. 

My only gripe is Namari and her mother not facing any consequences. Namari’s mother wanted the power of Sisu and the Dragon gem to benefit Fang I doubt they would have been peaceful even after restoring the world. They would have used it as a means to assert their dominance over the other factions. Maybe they could have set up Namari’s mother as the final villain and have Namari take on her mother in opposition in order to gain Raya’s trust or is that too cliche.

But (spoilers) someone help me understand Namaari’s statement near the end? She says >!something like “Raya is just as at fault for killing the dragon as I am.”!<

Obviously that’s not verbatim what she said, but it felt like a very important line to understanding the movie’s resolution and message. It just flew over my head. Any help?",lyj52m

gpvlhbb,"Amazing animation aside this movie was really bad and here is why i think that

1. Pacing of this movie is so fast, god it was like a roller coaster that just kept going straight really fast and trust me there is no fun in it. It kept jumping from one place to another without stopping or taking a moment to expand or build character and then it just ends.

2. There is just too many deus ex machina in this movie. The first piece they find just happen to be the one thy need and then it kept happening again and again for remaining pieces. 

3. Story had so many plot holes, i mean how did the first dragons remain stone when that orb was able to bring back every alive?. Why didnt that one dragon just won by keep raining on the monster?. Also every just forget and forgive fang nation for what they did?. 

Overall i am sure kids will like it but when u thin about it you will know that it just was not good.",lyj52m
gq1az2u,"No doubt the graphics is great, but if there is one thing The Good Dinosaur taught us, is that great graphics cannot make up for a poor story.

A lot of the plot points don't make any sense; the villain is some mist that eat someone's soul and stone them, and to defeat them you need magic/stone. Okay...

I can't understand why Raya volunteered to show the blue gem, since the father already explained how important it is and that people are after it. Just because someone gives you a necklace, you don't volunteer to show them the gem. This plot point makes no sense.

And all those ""quests"" to the four different tribes... come on, none of each is memorable. It is purely done to ""recruit""; get the boy onboard, get the baby girl and monkeys, get Tong... and how Tong gets onboard is... come on.

They want to build a film that's about ""trust"", but the problem is it's never reinforced meaningfully other than Sisu's dialogue ""we need to trust them, the world is broken because we don't trust them."" If Raya has trust issue, then how did she trust her ""crew"" so easily?

Just because there are a lot of elements infused into a story, it doesn't make it ""full"", in fact it weakens each component detrimentally.

Good movie is about ""one"" quest, and that's how you get your audience to invest in it. And that quest, must have a ""human connection"".

You can argue Raya has one quest, to gather the five gem pieces; but that substantially weakens the story.",lyj52m
gqbt082,"This was really underwhelming. Starting with the good.

* Like everyone else in the world has said, the animation was exceptional. But something special to note about the animation is that it wasn't just pretty to look at it, it also contributed to the storytelling in a really beautiful way. My favorite element of the story, the statues, was purely expressed through visuals. To be honest, if I was going to watch this movie again, I might do it dubbed in another language just so I could experience the soundtrack and visual storyboarding without having to pay attention to all the plot holes.
* Voice acting was good. Yes, I even liked Awkwafina's performance.
* Speaking of which, the character design on human Sisu was really cute. She was charming without being traditionally pretty.
* The worldbuilding was vivid and rich. It would've been nice to see more of it.

Okay, time for the bad.

* They went for a grand adventure, which is fine, but stories like that are usually split into multiple installments for a reason. There was way too much worldbuilding to get through in under two hours, and it showed in the pacing. It felt like we were racing from one plot point to another without ever actually getting to experience anything.
* MacGuffin quest. This would be less annoying if Moana hadn't already used the MacGuffin element.
* The side characters fell completely flat. Disney usually excels at side characters, but they felt so completely forced and soulless in this movie. I think it was the way they pointedly collected them one by one and discussed their backstories (which were all the same) that made them feel like they should've been more fleshed out. But again, there was no time for that. With the exception of the shrimp kid who joined the group organically, their inclusion was pretty forced, too.
* Special mention goes to ninja baby. For some reason we're watching The Boss Baby now. She is, IMO, absolutely the worst part of this movie. It's such a cheap and grating attempt to be funny and cute.
* Speaking of humor, most of it fell flat. They made some attempts at running jokes that just didn't land, at least for me. And like everyone else has said, the modern humor didn't really work either.
* The opening sequence was extremely predictable and loaded with exposition. Two bait and switches? Come on.
* There are a lot of logical inconsistencies throughout the movie. Here are a handful:

1. Knowing that Raya wanted Sisu to keep her existence a secret, why did Sisu have to transform into a dragon when saving her from Namaari in Spine? She'd already demonstrated that she can use the fog in her human form. She didn't need to reveal herself.
2. This one's been mentioned a lot, but the movie doesn't explain why the dragons were stone the first time they drove the Druun back and not the second time. I've seen some explanations having to do with human trust, but enough people didn't get that, myself included, that I think it's safe to say the movie did a bad job explaining it, if that's even the reason they were going for.
3. When Sisu tells the story of how she drove back the Druun the first time, she's talking about how she blindly trusted her siblings because they trusted her, and it all (mostly) worked out, and Raya should trust, too. But asking Raya to trust Namaari is a completely different situation. Sisu knew and loved her siblings, and they'd never given her a reason to believe they would do something to harm her. Namaari had more than proven that she wasn't worthy of trust. Why in the world did that story work on Raya? Not to mention, Raya was right! Namaari ended up killing Sisu!

The movie is saturated with crap like this. One or two inconsistencies or inconsistencies that can be handwaved because ""magic"" are okay, but at some point the characters are too erratic to become engaged in.

This gets a C, and almost all of that is held up by the visuals.",lyj52m
gq0rkm5,"I feel the movie would have needed much more darkness to fully shine through. If you think about it the situation at the beginning of the main story line is pretty horrible and I'm just not buying that ""all you need to do is trust in other people and then magically everything will turn out to be good"". I mean the movie showed itself that if you trust people blindly terrible things can happen and that it's not just that easy. 

I get that it is a childrens movie and they probably focused on it being pretty. Yes it is insanely pretty, but they should have put more effort into the story as well.",lyj52m

h0qa5wf,"I did not think this film was good, I'm surprised the top comment is positive. The movie had an awful message about humans innate fear of trusting people, the world building was really bad (ie why did the dragons who could summon rain die to monsters who were hurt by water), the plot points were forced and obvious without feeling earned (two young girls walk into booby trapped hidden temple miles away where their most precious gem is held only to obviously get back stabbed by two kids who talk like college students), the dialogue felt modern in a fantasy world in a way that felt jarring unlike frozen or Moana, and the characters were not enjoyable. Add in the heavily engineered merchandise characters (the mount), the ungrounded actions (a ""con baby"" and their monkeys doing acrobatics) and the constant inconsistencies (everyone who turns to stone does so with their hands out until the main characters die, in which case it's however they were standing emotionally) and it became really hard to stay invested. Despite feeling like they wanted a realistic world like Moana, it felt even more over the top in all of its action and chase scenes making it feel more fantastical and unbelievable. It just didn't feel grounded, I guess is my point, so it was hard to care. 

Idk, my house was excited to watch this and then we felt like we lost 2 hours of our time because this film's getting high praise and it really didn't feel earned.",lyj52m

I mean in that the story work as a movie but it could have worked a lot better with proper developments of each region and also development of each of the many side characters. Instead, its more of a dash to the finish and the character growth of namaari or HER MOM seems too sudden or illogical in the grand scheme of things.

Beautiful visuals like really amazing worlds and the water looks gorgeous. Also, the different regions seem super small in comparison to like the different nations in avatar, like just 5 different villages? And why are all plague like creatures always depicted as mist or clouds, kinda want it to be some actual mystical creatures or something but I digress.

I enjoyed the film overall but a series would have probably been the better choice for a journey across different cities and developing the villains and people more. Then again, it might become too similar to atla lol. 

Enjoyable movie with breathtaking visuals but a rather simple story.

Oh yeah I was afraid about the humour since personally I wasn't a fan of the humour awkwafina gave in the trailer and I still didn't like it. The emotional beats, visuals, lore and music all worked except for the humour but it's just a personal preference.",lyj52m

On the other hand, this is dope if you're into visuals.",lyj52m
gpys6hd,"This movie is gorgeous, a real treat for the eyes and ears...except when the characters had to talk to each other. The dialogue really feels clunky to me in a way that no other recent Walt Disney Animation Studios film has felt. There's nothing wrong with the voice acting, but lines often feel written like a performative wink to the audience rather than an actual conversation people would have. Maybe it's because WDAS films set in fantasy settings usually use musical numbers to deliver exposition and to signal character development, and it feels off to not have that? Still, it sometimes felt like the writers were pushed to make the dialogue sound more like it's speaking down to the audience because the story itself was so serious.",lyj52m

Story - had potential, executed poorly
Char motivations - poorly executed
Humor - excessively nonsensically. Not a single humorous moments is character specific. I.e, every skit was just slapstick that would have landed exactly the same way, if you swapped out the characters in the scene.

And for context, I'm a Disney fanatic, annual pass holder, and house of mouse simp. Watched this with 5 of my friends who all have their own tastes in Disney, and nobody liked it.

Plot, story, message, were all pretty good but the cliches, and convenience to get from one point to another were so bad.

Why did water affect the bad guys? And if it did then how would a dragon who could make it rain not stop them immediately. ""Well water just repels it!"" Does it? I have no idea.

Why was this dragon chosen to carry the powers? Not explained at all. And why did the dragon disappear? Why was it at some ship wreck?

Why did the sacrifice free humans and not the dragons? Seems pretty convenient. 

Baby ninja is funny, 8 year old nephew loved her. But at the end of the day its a fucking baby. I understand the suspension of belief here but lets be real. They could have made her the same age as Boon and have made it a little love interest for him. To show further unity between the tribes.

The dragon can glow...haha they stole that from Sky High. One dragon can glow the other one can make it rain. Okay I guess.

Having a movie about a dragon, then having the dragon turn into a person is a waste of a dragon.

In my opinion there was no point in keeping the pieces away from the evil mom lady. Also 2d characters and raya in the movie was like ""this entire thing is my first I shouldn't of let someone there""  
One time. And she made the biggest dumbass decisions . She left the valuable pieces to save the world in her bag in the open after saying there a re pickpocket and thieves. Also in the last scene were there like ""we dont trust her she killed the dragon"" as they are being attacked was so fhcking dumb. Like what are you gonna do not give it to her we have all the pieces!! I just hated this movie. Oh and also the way the dragon died was so dumb. She got shot of a cliff at point blank range  and raya was like lemme just fuck with this girl and hit her crossbow.. another weird thing the dad was frozen with an arrow in his leg. Unless he pulled it out. But I guess this is fucking Dr stone . .also whenever someone was not holding a piece of the orb thing. They would become stone from the creature's willingly. Like WHAT!? Then she decides to almost leave  the cave. Before being like ""oh right they trust me "" before heading back. The worst character was the evil rival. I'm not even including the dragon becuase she served no purpose.then I dont know why when the water dragon was killed the water just disappeared.  Considering that the other dragons are frozen and before the dragon was awoken their was still later. I find it all so dumb. The movie could of been better if they spent more time in each faction. Giving origins to the characters  instead of being like ""oh they're gone their stone""  I cant believe people had to pay fo this move. The only cool thing about this movie was the scenery . Btw a fucking baby outran a full grown woman who trained in combat for 6 years.  I hated this movie so much.",lyj52m
h1t5e7s,"Maybe it's just me, but last I checked, Namaari didn't even mention brining up the dragon stone when she first met Raya, and Raya straight up takes her to it, despite a literal life-long training from her dad on how important keeping the stone protected was.

Like, if Namaari had sweet talked her into seeing the stone, the whole message of trust would have worked, but since Namaari didn't, it's less about trust and more about having common sense.

The crossbow scene I can kind of forgive, as Namaari was squeezing the trigger, BUT we won't ever know if she'd have pulled it fully. So Raya freaking out and attacking Namaari is still Raya's fault for Cesui's temporary death. Namaari had a point, if Cesui was willing to trust her life in Namaari's hands, but not Raya, who's really to blame for Cesui's death? In any case, it worked out because apparently death is not something permenant for the dragons. 

Really, all this movie needed was Raya getting sweet-talked into showing the stone, but the fact she did it on her own initiative, and then blames Namaari for everything, has this undertone of ""I don't need to accept personal responsibility for anything because no one else but me saw it happen"".",lyj52m

I noticed, when she goes back to Fang, all the kids are like ""IT'S PRINCESS NAMAARI, YAAAY"" which shows she is liked by her people, and probably actually not as ruthless and cold as her time on-screen shows.

I get where people are coming from about the story and I don't mind a redemption arc for the villain but they didn't really flush it out that well with honest actions of the characters. Despite that, it felt like Raya never was in trouble or down on her luck in a serious way... Her getting all the stones seemed super easy? I don't know. Loved the idea behind the world they built but the plot was so disappointing whose location was confined to a ferry ride the whole movie. There weren't any side plots and people's decision making was forced. Kind of a generic let down due to writing. Also, did all the dragons have water walking powers at the very end?",lyj52m
gq48c1b,"Just finished watching it. It was one of those movies that you start watching not expecting too much but here I am after finishing it, still just left awestruck by each and every frame of it.

gpw5zdt,"Of all the animated movies announced by Disney after Zootopia, this one easily sounded the most interesting to me, as much like that film, Raya and the Last Dragon is a completely original story with its own worldbuilding and unique style, and it shows in the breathtaking animation with creative set pieces and action that's a lot of fun to watch. After what seemed like a slight decline for Disney in recent years with a couple of slightly underwhelming and unnecessary sequels, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they can still deliver when they actually put their hearts into it.

That being said, I don't think it's their best movie. The film suffers from dumping a ton of exposition right at the beginning, with a bunch of blink-and-you'll-miss-it references to things that become extremely important to the plot later on. Plus, some of the dialogue felt a bit awkward at times, especially considering the fantasy setting, such as a couple of characters calling each other ""nerds"" and some odd moments here and there, like how a character would say a catchphrase that didn't really sound like it suited the situation. However, I think that's more of an issue with the voice directors than the actors, and  I actually thought the casting was fine, with Kelly Marie Tran sounding a lot more natural and at home here than she was with her role in the Star Wars sequels.

A lot of people seem to think Sisu was a little too annoying, but I thought she was still pretty cute and likable. Plus, the way her backstory tied into the main plot was neat (even if it was somewhat brief) and gave the storyline about finding artifacts more significance than a pointless fetch quest. A lot of the other side characters are entertaining as well.

As a lot of people have already pointed out, the whole message about forgiving your enemies, while a good message on its own (especially during a time of rampant cancel culture), would've worked a lot better if it was genuinely earned instead of being pushed aside for most of the movie in favor of a mindless smoke monster that conveniently gets destroyed when the characters stop fighting. Even when the theme of forgiveness does come back later on, it abruptly happens right in the middle of an intense battle between two characters who have tried to kill each other multiple times with the world collapsing around everyone, making it feel more like a sudden plot twist for the sake of ""subverting your expectations"" instead of a legitimate payoff that was properly built up. While I can understand Disney wanting to try something different than the typical third act twist villain trope in their latest movies, it's hard to take seriously when it pretty much comes out of nowhere and provides no clash of ideologies to solidify the protagonists' motivations or any true embodiment of evil to fight against. Sure, there's also the conflict between the different nations, but even that subplot ultimately just plays into the aforementioned ticking time bomb, and the fact that the rules of how that world-destroying smoke monster works are so vague causes a lot of potential plot holes regarding where it came from and how it wasn't defeated for so long, though honestly, that's the only major issue I have with the movie. The conflict feels rushed and underdeveloped, especially for a story with such high stakes.

I can't really go into more detail without dropping some major spoilers, but I digress. Overall, it's still an enjoyable movie with great animation and plenty of memorable moments. That being said, if you are going to watch it, don't bother spending $35 plus a Disney+ subscription fee. Just watch it in theaters if you can. Disney doesn't need your money to survive during these hard times. Theaters do, and unless you support them, they're going to die out, so do your part, please.",lyj52m

Gorgeous animation, fantastic character design on Raya with the wandering gunslinger/samurai look (like, REALLY good) and did I mention the absolutely fantastic animation?

gq242bl,I really loved this movie but part of me wished it was either a game or a television series. Game wise it reminded me of beyond good & evil.

gqejdpx,"The animation is probably the best Disney has ever done. Just absolutely insane techniques on display. The water man, the WATER. And am I crazy or have they gotten really good at faces? Really small facial tics, especially on Tong, come across despite the exaggerated features. They’re just on another level with it now. 

As for the plot it was pretty good. Nothing mind blowing, just very well executed. KMT did a fantastic job. Awkwafina was great and well utilized. It’s like the saw the Farewell and realized “oh right she can act” and let her balance schtick and quality delivery. Really strong voice cast all around. 

Honestly if D+ had just started with this movie for the 30 dollar rental I’d be more on board. Mulan really felt like a waste of my money. In a lot of ways this did exactly what Mulan wanted to do, but so much better. 

Small notes:

- Shizu’s human design screamed Noodle from Gorillaz for me and that made me so happy. She also had a crazy old lady vibe which works considering she’s an ancient dragon. Really all the characters were well designed, but she was my favorite. 

- Once again Alan Tudyk is the adorable side kick that I desperately need a plush of. Tuk Tuk is damn cute and actually useful. 

- Wish we got a little more of some of the nations. We got basically nothing from the first one beyond desolate wasteland and what we got of Spine was beautiful, but left me wanting more. 

- Man these guys loved Avatar a lot. I would not mind a show based on this universe that expands on Raya and Namaari’s relationship.",lyj52m
gqg7sdf,"- It's honestly Raya fault all of this happen
- Why does the Druun stone human in the same pose but not the dragons? Then later in the movie they group get to be in a pose they were in.
- Raya was stupid for revealing that she found Sisu
- I love Capt Boun. He was really funny.
- Why did Raya have the broken gems with her going to Tony. Wouldn't it have made sense to leave them at the boat.
- Raya keeps saying you can't trust anyone to Sisu over and over again. Makes me think Sisu will not trust Raya later on.
- Why are you stealing gem pieces? She literally told you earlier that she found Sisu 
- One thing that was annoying me is the fact she touched the gem piece and gets a new power. They always show it as if she absorb it. So why are the pieces still around.
- Over fun movie.",lyj52m

Soul was very deep and thought provoking and I just wanted some good fun and this movie delivered exactly on that. The visuals and animation as many have mentioned are indescribable.

Perfect kids movie id say.",lyj52m
gq2l71f,"Halfway thru and I can guess where it’s going. This is unbearable. As a SEA, I’m happy that Disney gave us some great representation paired along with beautiful animation, but man....the dialogue is unbearable and every new character introduced makes me cringe. The voice acting is over-enthusiastic, and the moral of the story is kind of convoluted, as others in this thread have mentioned. Am I being too harsh and grumpy? Maybe I’m just too old for these kinds of movies now. However, SOUL was able to capture my heart much quicker, so I’m kinda coming to the conclusion that this movie was rushed without much care besides the animation itself.",lyj52m

gq6ehko,"So as someone that’s Filipino, I was really excited when I first heard about this movie. Finally there was a Disney movie where my culture and I would be represented! I have to say, though, the movie was really disappointing. A large part of this is how much it seems to be lifted off two other pieces of popular culture: MCU Avengers and ATLA.

In regards to being based off the Avengers, the plot of the movie (**possible spoiler alert**) stems off how a large population of the world turned to stone (or dust in the MCU) and how, years later, the stones need to be collected and brought together to bring everyone back. And they haven’t aged while they were stone. (SPOILER HERE) The first thing I did after watching the movie was watch the scene from Guardians of the Galaxy when The Collector was explaining the infinity stones and the scene where people were huddled together swathed in glowing purple darkness looked a lot like the scene in Raya where they came together in Fang and reassembled the gem.

Regarding similarities to ATLA, it should be pretty evident without explanation for those that have watched the series. The introduction at the beginning of Raya essentially says: Fang. Heart. Talon. Spine. Tail. Long ago, the five nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the darkness attacked. Only the dragons, masters of water, could stop them, but when the world needed them most, they vanished. 500 years passed and I discovered the last dragon, a swimmer named Sisu. And although her swimming is great, she has a lot to learn before she’s ready to restore the gem and save everyone from the snap, I mean, the darkness. But I believe Sisu can save the world.”

In addition to this, young Raya looks nearly identical to Korra’s Book 2 look (which might be why you never see her in Heart clothing again when she’s older, and because I think the first trailer a year ago only showed her as a kid) and the antagonist for most of the movie was essentially just a female Zuko with an also nearly identical internal struggle. Who also fights with two swords. Even the palace in Fang strongly resembles the palace in Ba Sing Se, where the leader (Dai Li, not the Earth King) also believes dishonesty and denial are the best policies. 

The further I got into the movie the more it seemed like it really just consisted of other people’s stories that were put together for a passing grade in a project that could’ve been done in a genuine, original way but instead took the cheap way out. However, I have absolutely nothing against the animation: the water, the fabric, the food all looked amazing.",lyj52m
gpznlq1,Anyone else feel like the action was lackluster? It felt like it had no weight and had sloppy choreography.,lyj52m
gpvjzwq,"It was decent overall and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.

I can’t help but feel like it could have used more depth to up the risk bar and make the win feel bigger. Everything seemed a bit too easy.

I also just wish the dragon didn’t talk.  It was unnecessary and the movie would have worked just fine without that.  The dragon could have communicated the same points other ways.  That said, it wasn’t as annoying as I thought it would be. But it did take me out of it.  Especially, talking about night lights and group projects in school, and making cheesy jokes.

It also just really seems like the dragon could have just walked up to each of these places, wowed everyone and they would have been super happy to get their family and friends back and would have just given it the stone.  I feel like raya didn’t even need to be involved.  “Oh shit, that super awesome dragon we thought was dead is alive again and wants this stone back to fix the world and bring our love ones back!  Yep, here you go!”

Anyway, enjoyed it with the family and it looked amazing.  Probably only a one time watch for me, but zero regrets.",lyj52m
gq0451x,"I feel like the people asking for the Fang to be punished either missed the point of the movie, are too cynical, or both. I'll admit that it was a bit weird at first but the whole theme is being able to trust and forgive people lol",lyj52m
gq0dr8c,"Just like in Soul, they chose the ""safe"" ending instead of a darker one. Sisu and the other dragons should've stayed dead/in stone. That was the whole point of her death, to unite people.",lyj52m
gq3pwid,"Really enjoyed until sisu appeared. Dialog felt really off and felt too much like they were trying to rein in that Mulan mushu magic but landed completely flat. I had to stop watching from cringing, and my favorite episode of the office is dinner party...

Comments here are convincing me to go back and finish it, but surprised y'all like Awkwafinas performance so much. Writing seems crap and her acting isn't good enough to hide the writings flaws.",lyj52m
gptusv5,"It was great.  Classic Disney.  My only real issue is that Raya has no character flaws except, what I believe, is that she doesn't trust people.  Yet, the people that she shouldn't trust are non-trustworthy.  I just felt like Raya is a great character without a real flaw.",lyj52m
gptdhoi,The world building just felt so good in this movie and the pacing was excellent,lyj52m

gpvldln,"Spoilers!

Ok ok so am I the only one who thought it was ballsy that the disney princess didn’t save the day? An that the Disney princess died? 

And I also though they should have stayed stone so there story of sacrifice could be told.",lyj52m
gq1kxwo,"Raya and the Last Dragon was very underwhelming to what Disney is when it's at top form. There's nothing really outright bad about it per se, but it plays the standard Disney formula safe and ultimately is just an Animated Movie you'll barely remember outside of a couple of scenes. It simply doesn't have that Disney magic the classics had and you wish it aimed for higher levels. A Paint-by-numbers Dragon Chick Flick.

Most of the characters aside from Raya and Sisu are so bland that I can't remember their names and don't really get any character development. They're there just as comic relief and backup support. You won't remember the villain or the locations all that much either. Sisu the Dragon is alright in small doses as she gets a few okay lines and gags that are standard Disney fare. I didn't find her too annoying surprisingly and her powers give her some good scenes here and there when given the chance.

Raya gets a prologue that sets up her character and the main story of the film. Considering all the scenes and characters it uses, it doesn't really pay off all that well. The antagonists are so painfully obvious that I was kind of hoping something else would happen, but alas some dumb and contrived things happen to make the actual story begin. It becomes very predictable and kind of lazy for a big chunk of the film. To give the writers some credit though near the end it gets a bit better as the themes and emotional moments come together, but for the most part it's just a watchable quest fetch adventure trip.

The Animation is as expected very beautiful and smooth. The fight sequences are nicely done and locations are big and colourful. Voice work is good and the music fits well with the type of film it is. I'm sure it would look and sound great in theatres. The film's pacing is also fast and never feels like it drags, so kids will sit through this without much of a fuss easily.

Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is just there. It's neither good or bad really, it's borderline mediocre-passable. The jokes are a mixed bag, the story is safe and generic for the most part, and it doesn't leave you with a big impression after seeing it. If I wanted to rewatch a story with a Girl and Dragon in it, I'd watch the original Mulan from Disney. 5.5/10",lyj52m
gq2w1mx,I was excited for this and disappointed to say I think it’s mid. I just couldn’t find myself caring for the characters. Maybe it would’ve worked as a series considering how fast they went through each land. Very pretty to watch though.,lyj52m
gq5lbmk,"Didn’t like the movie. The animation and music was great but the storyline was very dull and predictable. You could summarize it as 2 girls getting into a fight on their 1st play date and having animosity all through high school, then being forced to rely on each other when they’re desperately trying to adjust to the real world. All that mixed with themes and characters in kids movies they grew up with like Mulan, the Neverending Story, moana, frozen, FernGully, boss baby, Coco, and a few more. The character designs and attitudes are not that different than the movies mentioned mixed with the modernized theme of “girl power” to carry the movie, which is doesn’t do that well because the writing was severely lacking in originality. I honestly thought it was going to be better than what it was based on how horrible Disney trailers usually are, but the trailer actually ended up making it look better than it actually was. Moana and Frozen were amazing girl power movies, but this is 100% a bad movie that is unoriginal and underwritten. The only thing that saves it is how good is the animation is, for the amount of work the animators put into the movie the story should have been much much better.",lyj52m

gpuicfw,I really enjoyed the movie; my first experience back in a theater since Tenet and it was worth it. As usual Disney animation is absolutely blowing it away from a visual perspective. I also really enjoyed the world the movie took place in the idea of the regions being named after parts of a dragon gave me a DnD fantasy vibe. The character developement was a little lack luster and the overall conflict seemed a bit forced. Especially with Fang being forgiven at the end despite them causing the original breaking of the gem and refusal to work together to bring everyone back. I still really enjoyed it so I would say solid 8/10. My nephew said it is a 10/10 best movie ever but he's 4 so...,lyj52m

I'm filipino and mostly heard about this after people said it had filipino representation in it. that's a fucking STREETTCCHH lmao. They had Arnis, and probably the dragons were inspired by visayan folklore, but that's it. I don't think the visayan folklore would have been obvious so it feels like they googled a filipino martial art and threw it in.

The world building and magic stuff was fantastic, every other thing... not so much.   
I usually like Awkwafina, but I didn't like her character (Sisu) at all. Found her unfunny and even annoying.  
Villain seemed badaas but she only had like 15 mins of screentime and I never understood what her plan was.  
The location and some characters seemed intersting, but they weren't utilized much.  
And finally, I hated how little subtle the movie was, as others people said, it felt like a MLP episode.   
I do wonder if the movie had a darker and more mature tone, and it got Disneyfied after Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada were attached to the project (Paul Briggs and Dean Wellins, now credited as co directors, were the orignal main directors) , just like Brave.  


Overall 6/10.

gq08sfe,"I was a bit hesitant at first to pay extra besides already paying monthly for having an account on Disney+ to watch the movie, but I did today and I'm glad I did. It was a very inspirational movie to me, and even though I'm not SE Asian, I'm happy there's more and more representation in today's kids' movies.

The movie plays on themes like *trust*, *courage* and *second chances*. Raya and the Last Dragon will teach kids that while you shouldn't blindly *trust* everyone, you sometimes need *courage* to give someone a *second chance*.

From the viewpoint of a 28 year old woman, I found the movie to be visually stunning, the music was amazing and the majority of the characters were wonderful. The story in itself was really good, but squeezing it in to last 1 1/2 hour made it appear a little flat and rushed. But overall it was a magical movie that I won't forget easily, as it made a positive impact on me. It was extra money well spent in my opinion.",lyj52m
gq1xjv7,"I haven’t read the majority opinion on this, but the movie was cute and had a lot to say. I gave it a 10/10 on IMDb to offset the intentional negative reviews, but it’s more like a 8.5/10 — there’s so much to love, mainly the visuals: holy fuck, so so so good. I kept thinking how many movies would benefit from this kind of treatment, but I believe there’s a lot of heart in this story — with a majority of it focused on trust and finding the good in people. Some of it can come across as forced, but seeing it with my family helped cement how important the exposition was. I wasn’t expecting much from this movie, but it’s a great blend of the animated version of *Mulan* and the joyous adventures from *Indiana Jones*. Best to see it in a theater that practices safe COVID guidelines, but it’s undeniably a fun movie - no matter where you watch.",lyj52m

Coming to the story, I see a lot of people complaining the logic of the ending. Yeah, the ending was pretty typical of a Disney movie I would say. In reality Fang cannot be trusted and they should face consequences for what they did. But the ending was supported by the core theme of the movie - trust.

gqum2au,"Just finished watching the movie. I rate it a 7/10. Very nicely animated. I liked the concept that it didn't involve a prince which is different from the other Disney movies. However there were some scenes that I didn't really like. 

1. Namaari: I have the biggest problem with her. I understand that she's supposed to be the 'villain' of the story, but her character was stupid? Like one moment she suggested to collect all the shreds so Fang can dominate the world, but then next moment she secretly want to save the world? She also seems to really be attached to Raya for no reason in the beginning after they grew up before she collected all the pieces.
2. Sisu: It doesn't make sense how Sisu can be injured by a small crossbow to the point where she was near her deathbed. She's a dragon with her siblings powers for God sake. Like cmon, for a mighty mystical creature it just seems oddly weird for it to get hurt like that. Also, she didn't have her own individual power...? She trusted the others, but that's not really a power....",lyj52m

gq2tqc7,"Seen it last night. 

While the writing was a bit flawed (noticed a trend of slightly disjointed third acts in some Disney films lately), the animation was stunning and impressive and the voice acting & humor were way better than I thought. The lore was pretty good as well as the music. The action scenes were also awesome to watch and I kind of like how a few scenes were similar to Guardians of the Galaxy for a bit. Kelly Marie Tran deserves more love for this one.

Not the best Disney film but still great. As a Southeast Asian myself, it feels really nice to see some aspects of our culture make it into a Disney film. The salakot, the arnis sticks, the nipa huts, Banaue Rice Terraces — it feels so refreshing. 8.5/10.",lyj52m

It goes from one thing to another and doesn’t really let the audience absorb (water pun) the side characters as much as it should. The baby/Awkwafina wasn’t as annoying as the trailers suggested. The portrayals of south East Asian culture was pretty faithful with the color palettes etc. Although the dragons did remind me of the My Little Pony franchise, maybe for Disney merchandising purposes. Overall, I enjoyed it 7 out of 10.",lyj52m

gpts7ec,"I actually hated the movie.  Another child's movie that accepts War Criminals in the end.  No white representation at all, not even a minor character, and let's make the war criminal the most like China's race so we can try to slowly conform the world to the CCP.  Good Job Disney.  The sound, cinematography, the art, effects were amazing though.  Voice actors were great as well.  Also, if they can stand any form of Water, not just moving water then why not make it rain 24/7?  I guess Water represents life/passage of time and the Dune turn things to stone and stop the living thing in time so maybe it needs to be a body of water as rain drops might not constitute time flowing.

The druun monster were the COVID pandemic, with the stone people represented both those we lost and our physical separation from our friends and family. Thus both the lament of the characters at losing their loved ones, the hope at seeing their loved ones again, and then their final joy at reunification, all relate to us during the pandemic. Additionally, Fang's concern that they will be blamed for the druun outbreak parallels multiple countries' bad behavior during the pandemic (including the US) and how it creates blame on the world stage. Disney is telling the world to put aside blame and hate (like the anti-Asian hate perpetuated by the pandemic) and wait for better days when we can be reunited.",lyj52m

Disney: We have a modern Avatar at home

Raya and the Last Dragon feels like a film that straddles that line between the minimum bar for what makes a good film and the minimum bar for what makes a Disney film. On the one hand, Disney once again presents a jaw dropping and gorgeous world with exemplary art direction on the characters and environment. Food looks delicious. Water looks real. The music hits all the right notes with superb acting. Nothing new here.

But the writing? Way too much room for improvement. Plot holes abound. Chronologically ambiguous dialogue. And the pacing is too squeezed for a 90 minute film. I get it - it's a Disney film - they have to make certain plot points like a drummer keeping time. But when the theme is about trust, something that is earned (as mentioned in the other comments), characters need space to establish and reinforce that theme. When they're on death's door they basically have no choice left. Just give the stone and spend eternity with the one person you already trust.

Overall I guess I'd say it's a 5/10. Too many missed opportunities. Would've been much better as a series. 

Now if you'll excuse me I'll be contemplating the next time I'll be watching someone named Zuko journey through the trust spectrum in a more satisfactory manner.",lyj52m

Raya and nobody else knew that it was feasible for humans to do the same thing. It's actually revealed in the climax that it's trust that makes the magic, not dragon magic.

Also, Sisu did save Raya from Namaari and Sisu was important to make Namaari question the consequences of her actions.

The fact they killed her off and forced the solution onto the humans lends more depth to the magic at work imo.",lyj52m

Drunes didn't have a history of doing that, and why would they be bragging about the city they built if it was so fragile? The only thing that changed was the water stopping.

Shishu's water ability is super random. She turns into water after.... any stressor? Being killed? Why didn't the other dragon's elements stop, I'm guessing because Drunes didn't kill them only made them inanimate?

gq34ubf,"Wow that would have made things so much more interesting, the antagonist/rival in this case would be Raya who is still ""the good guy"" but justifiably hates and distrusts Namaari while giving Namaari a better redemption arc.

Edit: It will also give further insight on Namaari's backstory and the situation in Fang. The film only briefly touched upon it when Namaari told Raya that things aren't as good as they seem in Fang but if Namaari is the protagonist then we get to see what those problems are in Fang and when Namaari visits Heart she sees it like its paradise (thanks to the crystal) while her people are suffering but of course after she betrays Raya and cause the apocalypse does she finally regrets it even though the situation in Fang became better thanks to the chunk of crystal they stole which leaves her conflicted. They can even show the benefits of having even just a chunk of the crystal like maybe before they struggled to grow anything on their farms but with the power of the crystal they're getting bountiful harvests and their clan flourished thanks to it (even though the rest of the world is suffering).",lyj52m

gqdsmen,"If you make naamari a Prince who has a crush on raya and a disapproving domineering mom who is grooming the future emperor, you’ll add even more internal pressure to the character.",lyj52m
gq3rdxi,"The problem is that that is a fairly standard heroic journey though. Oh no, I did a bad thing out of good intentions and must fix it.

I like the idea of having a Disney protagonist who is not an intrinsically perfect person. The idea that Raya is cynical and fails to trust and that this is a problem for her thorough the movie is interesting. 

The problem is that the movie goes to far out of it's own way to ensure that ""trusting someone"" is bad. It reinforces, and reinforces and reinforces Raya's views, and it never really lingers or shows those moments when trust could help/",lyj52m
gq2z4ke,Genius. This would have fixed a lot of my problems with the movie,lyj52m
h0zkbo1,"Holy shit. That would have been a way cooler story. To be honest, Raya felt like a recycled Rapunzel/Anna/Moana. They all act very similar. She only changed a little when she got older. I felt that Naamari's character was truly unique in every sense of the word.",lyj52m
gqlhd9h,Yes! This would have made the movie perfect,lyj52m

h7966c5,"I think Raya's arc could have worked if they had stuck to their guns and made her an actually untrusting person and also made Sisu see the consequences for the overly trusting nature. We'd have two characters from opposite that journey together and end up with a happy medium, but it's Disney so the princess must ge cutesy and fun and surrounded by cuddly animals.",lyj52m
h79a8nb,Not to mention the lesson isn’t driven home very well considering it’s 100% failure rate at Sizu’s hands.,lyj52m
gqv9bgp,That annnd nobody really trusts each other until they're at death's door...that's not trust,lyj52m
gsdts1a,"Nope this is 100% correct. Blindly trust everyone because eventually someone will repay that trust - but you will spend years suffering until that happens which is totally okay. Like what? Firstly, shaved head girl almost left them instead of assembling the stones and only went back because she’d be the only damn human alive if she didn’t, she shot sushi, and she caused all this mess in the first place. Secondly, sushi trusts everyone and it goes wrong multiple times. They make an effort to show how badly trusting people blindly can go. They basically say “hey guys, you can’t even trust a fucking baby, because it will steal your shit, but let’s just blindly trust a girl who is trying to betray everyone at every turn, shot sushi, and then blames Raya - and THEN they’ll bring the damn dragon back to life, because apparently even death is undoable when you trust”. 

I’m just...so confused. They tried to force a stupid message into a film that was nothing more than visually attractive and vaguely SEA influenced. Raya was also clearly a Mary Sue. She gets beat up one time, and NOTHING negative comes of her lack in trust. She does every single thing right. And yet she’s treated as though she doesn’t. 

And teaching kids that even death is undoable with a bit of faith even in the person who did it is fucking dangerous and wrong. I was waiting for a romance between the two leads or at least a real friendship - and I got a Mulan 2020-style main character and a pseudo villain whose choices make zero sense. 

Overall...this movie actually offended me. Disney taught me so much growing up about friendship and love and even nature and the beauty in world around me and being kind to others - and now they’re throwing a movie at kids that has a seriously confused, easily misinterpreted, potentially damaging message about...TRUST? Dafuq Disney.",lyj52m
h1mnbkm,"Yeah, there's no maybe about it. It is gaslighting, abusive nonsense.  They make Raya feel bad for not trusting people who are untrustworthy, only for her to get hurt again. And then instead of admitting they were wrong, they say, ""oh it must have been because you didn't trust them enough.""

This is just wrong, and it's gross that it's the main message.",lyj52m
h79ayqd,"Also correct me if I’m wrong. But not a single time does Sizu’s trust pay off in the film. 3 big instances where it comes up, and 3 times it fails.",lyj52m
grkokby,">The scene where Sisu dies is so incredibly frustrating. Again i think this was really bad writing. Its so obvious they didn't want to have any real villain in this movie except for the evil spooky clouds, but the film really suffered so much for it. Its so dumb that the dragon fan girl points her crossbow at a fucking dragon. How does she not realize ""hmm the dragon I've idolized and looked up to my entire life is working with my enemy and they say they want to fix the world.. am i the bad guy here? should i listen to them ? should i not point my fucking crossbow and the fucking dragon and think about pulling the trigger ??"". Susis death was 90% on namaari and 10% on raya. You cant blame raya after the constant betrayals from fang and namaari. She brought the weapon so her plan from the start was to betray them and shoot somebody if she needed to.

100% agree. That scene made me so MAD.",lyj52m
h0p0r0z,I agree with the fog/rain comment. I feel like it should have also made Spine impenetrable. I guess Disney just decided that only liquid water counts for whatever reason.,lyj52m

""It's your fault I tried to kidnap and ultimately killed the last dragon!"" 

The whole movie is supposed to be about forgiveness. You can't forgive someone who won't accept what they did was wrong. ESPECIALLY when Fang came to a peace summit with hostile intentions, broke the gem keeping the world from danger, and then doubled down on armed assault turned attempted murder.

It was a VERY mixed message at best. Harmfully enforcing toxic behaviors in young people at worst.",lyj52m
gq33z6n,"I knew something was gonna happen during that scene but what I thought was gonna happen was that Namaari's mom and some soldiers were gonna pop out and capture Raya and the gang and Raya's gonna be like ""You tricked me!"" while Namaari will be like ""No I didn't mean for this to happen"" and so on.",lyj52m
gq2d0gr,"You mean Sisu? I felt that way too. 

Namaari, you had a fucking gun (crossbow really) to Sisu’s head and almost shot her until I knocked it outta your hand. Fuck you for saying I’m equally responsible, if not at all.",lyj52m

that part was so cringe for me",lyj52m
gq384j0,"But she is right, tho. I felt the very same thing during that scene. Raya attacks, hits the crossbow that makes Namari flinch and fire, while crossbow is also hit with the sword and thus changing trajectory into heart.

Raya is at the same fault.

If you dont want Raya be at fault, make Namari shoot first, not after Raya hits the weapon.",lyj52m
h1t1mor,"Actually, it was. Namaari was about to change her mind because Sisu put her faith in her. But Raya didn’t trust her so she tossed her dragon tail sword thing (cool sword by the way) at the crossbow, causing it to go off.",lyj52m
gq2zr6u,"I dunno.. I felt the same was as the enemy girl. I mean.. Raya pulled the gun and aimed the shot at the dragon. It was Raya's fault too from my point of view, as well. More nonsensical to me was that it should be emotional, or something, when she runs into the temple to fight the enemy girl? What was the point.. revenge? Chop her head off cause Raya had a part in killing the dragon? It was all pretty strange and made no real sense to me. (yeah, she might have been blinded ""by rage and revenge"", but hard to invest oneself into it, when the one that is after revenge has the same part in killing)",lyj52m

Well I can only guess that since the crystals never really reacted to them putting their trust that they only needed someone who fully trusted themselves and no more human alive to give the druuns streng by being negative...",lyj52m
h1t5udq,"Yeah but Sisus trusted Namarri not to pull the trigger, which, we'll never know if she would have pulled it all the way. She was very close to squeezing it (which was a stupid plan, I mean...is your mom gonna be happy you killed the only thing capable of stopping the Dru?), but the movie made a big point that she was very conflicted over it.

Like the fantasy world they created feels like one that would have been good for a longer series

The monsters arose because the people didn’t trust each other. The dragons understood that in order to hold the monsters at bay, they had to generate the largest value trust possible. So, they gathered all their power and gave it to the most incompetent dragon, the one no one believed could set things right, and the incredible amount of trust the other dragons had to gather in order to leave her in charge was enough to hold back the monsters. 

Eventually, the humans reached a point where they broke the gem that was the symbol of the dragons trust and the monsters were free to wreak havoc again. 

So, at the end, in order to defeat the monsters, the humans have to make another even bigger show of trust. And they do that by trusting the least trustworthy person any of them have ever met. A person who has double-crossed them time and time again. That Fang gal was so untrustworthy, she was a hair’s breadth away from taking all the gem pieces and abandon them.

This took me out of the film, I was so engrossed, weeping and then they did this really hamfisted straight faced ""subvert expectation"", ""villains journey"" postmodern-shitsandwich switcheroo.

Ignore my squeezing trigger finger and the fact that I had it instantly aimed at the dragon in the first place.  ""PS I will now literally try to kill YOU. Yet the musical score and cinematic tricks are trying to portray me as being justified teehee."" 


 i understand the message to us viewers about trust, I saw it coming, but how the fuck can go they portray Namaari be so confident that she's right? Why do they choose such a blunt buy it or lose it method in this one scene after spending such delicate care the whole film.

How did she figure out Sisu's exact ""test of trust?"" from that one encounter? To such a degree that she's literally SCOLDING the protagonist. She's GASLIGHTING Raya harder than The Joker on his best day against the Batman.

gpz173k,"The mother is the real bad guy here, IMO.

Namarri was probably raised under hate, that all other countries are against them. She has good intentions, but isn't mature enough to make the right decisions because of the way she was raised. Look at the way she ran to the mother when she found out about the dragon. She *wants* to make things right.

But she doesn't know any better because her mother probably poisoned her mind ever since she was little. Her country may seem powerful, but they can't even afford or eat rice. They are poor. If you saw other people looking like they can easily eat bountifully (e.g. Heart inviting all other nations for a feast), wouldn't there be a little part inside you thinking, ""We just want some food. You have the Dragon Gem, ffs. Share the wealth.""

Compound these kinds of situations with her mother saying ""the other countries won't understand us, we need to take it from them,"" and you get a complex upbringing that can't be solely faulted on Nammari.

~~Also, when Nammari shot Sisu, it seemed to be more of a panicked reaction. She was raised with distrust of other people, and they're like, ""Give us your gem. Trust us."" So she raises her crossbow, and is like ""Back up for a second. Let me think."" But protagonist was the first to attack, and Nammari shot in reaction.~~

You know what would have made it better?

But I do agree that some form of remorse from the mother or at least some closure of the conflict between her and her daughter is missing from this film. I would assume this was skipped for the sake of keeping a well-paced narrative. 

And finally, as devil's advocate for the Fang queen, yes they caused the downfall of the world, but all of the tribes began fighting for the stone almost immediately, showing that if Fang hadn't gone for it first, any of the rest of them would have. Knowing her clan would be villainized by the rest of the clans just for doing first what they would have done anyways, it is actually logical for her to think of the safety of her people as she understands there is a large target on her back.",lyj52m
gq2tfpk,"Well she never tries to kill Raya outright. She wants to take her back alive each time.

gq2d9po,"While I agree there with the view that there is not a lot of reason to trust Fang, the real moral of the story that I got is that ""distrust"" is a never-ending cycle, and it takes a lot of courage to be the one to be trusting and end that cycle. Yes, Naamari is not trustful, but I think the real point is that it took a lot of strength and humility for Raya to break the cycle of distrust. Like you said, there is absolutely no reason to trust Fang, but the only hope for saving the world was TO trust Fang.

To expand a little bit, I think many are trying to simplify the story by making Fang the ""villain"" (i.e. trying to depict them as the ""Fire Nation"" of the movie). At the very beginning, it was said that the nations splitting was a direct result of these different regions distrust each other. No nation was really the ""villain,"" but each was guilty of their own assumptions, streotyping the other nations, and complete distrust of each nation. The movie starts by showing how suspicious and distrusting each nation was of each other (a simple dinner invite was received with high tension, every nation thinking he other was sus). We are shown the beginning only from Heart's point of view, but I would think if we were shown the point of view from any of the other nations, Heart would probably look just as ""suspicious"" as the others.

In my opinion, the whole final conflict is that it's not about Raya getting the blame or being manipulated into feeling guilty, it's about Raya ACTUALLY being the better person (i.e. the hero of the story) by breaking the cycle of distrust that has plagued this world for hundreds of years (as Sisu has continued to say). Arguably, the flaw of the movie could be we didn't spend enough time with each nation, as it looks like many did not take away this message (which I believe was also the production team's intent).",lyj52m
gq4p538,"The moral of the story is that distrust is self-perpetuating and that someone at some point has to be willing to give their trust without a good reason in order to break that cycle, which is a fine lesson in theory, but yeah the movie doesn't do a very good at conveying the message, it's way too forced & unnatural.",lyj52m

The main conflict of the movie happened because Raya trusted Namaari in the beginning of the movie, but the political situation in Kumandra was already unstable. The stone was never going to be safe forever. It is only after all the suffering the countries went through, could a real resolution happen to save their world. There were no dragons in the beginning of the movie, but after all the shit that went down, they returned. The message is not to “trust those who betrayed you”, its that some problems are more important than the betrayal you experienced, and can only be solved with the help of people you distrust.

gsdv5wb,"How about when sushi becomes the queen dragon or something at the end? She did NOTHING. In fact she made several highly questionable choices. They make an effort to show certain things in the movie, and then deliberately contradict them later. Neymar was literally pulling the trigger, but they try to act like she wasn’t going to, and that Raya made her by defending sushi. Sushi trusts several people who betray her, and then teaches RAYA about trust? She clearly knows nothing. These are deliberate contradictions that make no sense. 

Also the damn alien ninja baby almost made me switch off the screen. You can’t go from an epic super baby to a cute babbling normal baby in two minutes and expect it to be any type of believable in any fantasy world. 

Also - someone should’ve died and stayed dead. I felt zero emotional connection with anyone who died because I knew damn well they weren’t actually dead. It also seems like humans are gonna go through this cycle again - next time they have “discord” more black slop will be born and turn everyone into stone for some reason. 

Also it pissed me off that Raya being a guardian of the gem literally meant absolutely nothing. 

Also, this whole thing was her dads fault. RAYA should’ve suggested the meeting and then had her own stupidity betrayed, so that she actually had a level of guilt. Her guilt made no sense because she was a child who trusted another child, as children do. All the way through she thinks it’s her fault. It’s her dumb ass father. 

ALSO - they need to stop acting like neymar and Raya had any type of friendship - they knew each other for literally five minutes and I’m meant to feel like she was betrayed? No. Make it about a friendship or romance fighting to remain strong and trusting in the face of mayhem caused by idiots. Not some Mary Sue who magically does everything right and then is told she’s wrong at the end. I’d love it if they’d met kovu and kiara style beforehand, then Raya had convinced her father that they had changed - and THEN everything had happened. That one small change would’ve made the entire movie better. 

This movie should be called “Raya and the gaslighting assholes”. There are too many “also, this is absurd”’s to even make this movie rewatchable for me. 0/10 recommend.",lyj52m

You may not like it, but the explanation we got in the temple was that the Druun were primordial manifestations of *human* discord. The dragon sacrifice could only slow them down, but having humans trust each other with the bomb was more effective.

gqbou0i,"I agree. When a film tries to present a message but has a storyline and sequence of events that do nothing but work against the themes that it is trying to present, that's when I believe a film has failed in teaching its theme. With Raya's theme of trust especially, the presentation of that theme was lost in translation, which I feel Raya stumbled over itself in trying to teach the importance of trust and mutual understanding. At every turn, Raya is antagonized for her distrust of a woman whose betrayal is responsible for the cataclysm that set the Druun upon her entire kingdom and caused Raya to lose everyone. I felt that Raya was punished for her vulnerabilities in that regard, and antagonized in order to drive the theme. The film did nothing to understand things from Raya's side of the story when for everything she went through, she's criticized for her natural distrust of those who have done her wrong.

It's not a bad message to teach trust, but the film gave nothing *but* reasons to fear trust, if anything, because it shows us the consequences of blind trust at every turn, while not acknowledging that as also being an important factor in how we recognize trust toward other people. Blind trust is important to recognize, and trust is a healthy concept, but the film has a black-and-white perception of that which more seems to suggest that blind trust is the *healthiest* form of trust, and that to be distrustful of those who harmed you, is to not see things from their perspective and dwell in ignorance. When at every turn, Raya is validated in her distrust of Namaari. Great animation and visuals, but I feel the world was rather used as set dressing while jumping from province to province without really immersing the audience within the world of Kumandra. The side characters, locales, and even the culture all felt like devices to simply drive the formulaic fetch quest that is the film's Dragon Gem storyline, and nothing more.",lyj52m
gqezwe8,"I feel like nowadays every Disney film HAS to come with some \~life lesson\~ and this one they shoe horned trust in. Only, they didn't care to write it in WELL.",lyj52m
gq0zb6w,"While I get what you mean, Namaari and Raya's relationship solely consists of ""Raya trusts Namaari, Namaari betrays Raya for selfish reasons."" In order for a message like this to work the story needs to spend more time with Fang to really show us their point of view. We get hints that Fang is a broken country but are never really shown their plights or why they'd want to stop Raya. I think we were supposed to get the impression that Fang's becoming crowded and is running out of land for food, but in the brief instances where we see Fang everyone seems fine and happy. So their attempts to stop Raya just comes across as them being power-hungry. There's no real distrust from Fang's perspective, so Raya being brave and taking the first step doesn't come across that way. It comes across as just allowing someone to hurt you again, and again, and again.

This would've been solved if they turned this movie into a mini-series instead and let us properly see the characters and world, imo. There's not a lot of time allotted for proper character and world expansion in a movie.",lyj52m

h0mf05w,"Disney magic...

My theory is that the root cause for the appearance of the Druun was humans loosing trust in each other and separating into various tribes. The dragons fought them off but never beat them, the stone only being a deterrant, and it was only able to turn back humans somehow.

By restoring the human's trust in each other, Raya and co beat the Druun for good and everyone transformed in stone turn back to normal, dragons include.

Nothing in the movie supports that theory and it's based on ""magic, nuff said"" more than anything, but that's how I make sense of it.",lyj52m

It's a risk since it's not the normal Disney princess movie, and on top of that there's the whole Disney+ / theater release.

I bought this movie on premiere access on the hopes that Disney realizes that we STILL want original movies and stories. I also didn't buy the Mulan remake on premiere access for this reason too. It seems like they are finally getting out of that funk a little bit, but I just couldn't stand the constant sequels and live action remakes.

The story itself in my opinion wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, but it was still very enjoyable and the animation was gorgeous. I sincerely hope we get more originals down the line from Disney as I think that's when they are at their most creative and interesting.",lyj52m

grlmkov,"The movie would have been better from the perspective of Namaari imo. It would have been more impactful to watch her redeem herself and work towards earning the trust of the other tribes.

Instead, we're stuck with Raya who, from the start, was incredibly distrusting, judgemental, and ignorant of other people's plight (why not show this too). So, her losing trust in people wasn't such a big deal because she already didn't trust them. And of course people would assume they're using the gem when they have been keeping it for so long and all the other tribes are supposedly struggling (seriously, was Namaari lying or were the other tribes having major issues?). She just came across as uber priviledged.

Also, why didn't the movie SHOW Raya how to trust by proving her wrong about the people she distrusted? Why confirm further that they're bad and just use Sisu to TELL her to trust?

It seemed like no one was capable of forming good plans either. Raya was a big hypocrite who rambles on about not being able to trust anyone, and makes her life complicated by stealing from other tribes when they should have been all in with helping Sisu. The Fang's plan was to kidnap a talking and senient dragon when they could have also redeemed themselves by being helpful instead of being even bigger assholes.

The ""climax"" becomes even more mindless. Namaari's plan was to go by herself to kidnap a dragon and blames Raya when she was the one holding the weapon. The audacity to blame others for not trusting her AFTER ALL THE TIMES SHE ATTEMPTED TO HARM them... I cannot.

No wonder the fight scene didn't hold any weight. Every step of the way was stupid. Then the resolution was such a Frozen move too. But instead of instantly fixing things with love, this time, it's trust.

SUMMARY: Raya is a movie with great visuals, character designs, and a plot full of promises. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any of it.

Sisu tries to go shopping on credit and is nearly lynched. She is rescued by local boss lady who attempts to kill her. She also trusted Namaari and is shot in the heart. 

Meanwhile, Raya pays half up front for her boat ride and half when they get there, thus establishing trust. She buys the baby gang’s loyalty with food, thus establishing trust. She is captured by Tang and they join together on mutual objectives to save the world, this establishing trust. Raya is constantly having to save Sisu from blindly trusting.

The whole trust thing to save the world seemed so stupid too. The gem is powered by trusting someone? They had to turn to stone to show their trust? They knew if the gem worked that they would all return back so what are the stakes? It's not like Namaari had any other choice but to try and piece t together anyway.

gq3qslh,"The movie shows Namari twitching on the trigger before Raya intervenes, and it shows Raya noticing that. 

Now, Raya is still in a small part to blame, but I'd argue that the person bringing a weapon, pointing that weapon at someone, and then almost firing that weapon has a greater share of the blame than 50%.

The argument that Raya was partially to blame would have worked better if Namari actually pointed the crossbow away for a moment (perhaps distracted or convinced by the dragon), and Raya took that as an opportunity to try and disarm her.",lyj52m

If the final act had been all the people they tricked and stole from showing up to back them up in the final hour because they want to save the world as much as Raya does.

I think that the movie could have made this point better if it emphasized more distrust is the destroyer, that Raja's choice to re-unite the gems through stealing and subterfuge is what caused a lot of her problems. If it focused more on her coming to trust her teammates, instead of just skipping over that after a joint commiseration of loss. Because that would mean that trust gets some other victories on camera, beyond just moral Deus Ex Machine of ""my preferred moral lesson powers the McGuffin that saves the world.""

We only have the main character and her father who are framed as caring for the world, and they explicitly state that the gem doesn't provide any benefits to them nor is it ever alluded to again. The whole point of it is that despite it providing them with nothing, the other nations are greedy, as humans are, and want it because they think it must do something good for them. Heart may have been greedy as well, had they not had it, but that's a hypothetical. 

Also while Heart seemed idyllic, we saw very little of it. We were only shown the main royal castle and it's framed as a tranquil place because the people are tranquil, just like Spine is about raw power. I'm sure they have issues just like everywhere else. The other nations aren't starving, Fang princess simply said they haven't had rice for quite some time, not that she hasn't had food. After the dragons left, everywhere became less plentiful, which would lead to the assumption that Heart used to be even MORE plentiful than it currently is. This also could just be her playing on Raya's empathy to get close to the stone but maybe not.

Then when she trusts Namaari to help them piece together the gem at the end of the story, Namaari pulls a crossbow and kills the dragon, all while blaming Raya. What kind of message is Disney sending? Blindly forgive those who intentionally hurt you repeatedly?

Here Raya only has to learn to blindly trust despite getting smacked for it every time except for the one moment where Naamari has no choice but to honor that trust to save her own skin. She doesn't really change, neither of them do and the film says everything is okay with flying dragons and swelling music. There's no reason to believe Naamari won't betray some other trust  later when it suits her or her family.",lyj52m

gpukexr,"Everyone keeps talking about the ""gorgeous animation"" and they're not looking into the story. In the beginning, it was established that the other nations were jealous of Heart because they had the magic orb which led to them being prosperous. Raya and her dad said it was ridiculous of the other nations to think this way. When the orb breaks into pieces, Fang and the other nations get a piece of the orb. However, the head of the Fang nation explicitly establishes that they were able to develop the nation due to their own hard work. The leader doesn't say something like ""we became developed because the leader got a piece of the orb"".

Another part was when the movie was 3/4 of the way through and there was a conversation between the shrimp boat kid and Raya. The kid helped Raya collect 3 of the 5 pieces of the orb and there's a dialogue where the kid says ""I want to come with you to help"" and Raya says ""no, it's too dangerous""... he already helped you get 3 pieces and there is 1 piece left!


Going back to design, I feel like they copied elements from Spirited Away and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Sisu's design is from Haku, and the three monkeys and baby design seems stolen from the three green heads and baby in Spirited Away.

gq13yag,"Yeah, I think the script would’ve benefited from cutting the number of realms down to three to give them each more breathing room.

That being said, Fang’s reason for distrusting Raya is clear. They expect punishment for their initial mistake. That’s actually a pretty realistic motivation. For a real world comparison, one reason the Germans fought until the bitter end in WW2 was that they expected it to end in another brutal peace treaty ala the Treaty of Versailles from WW1. If Germans had known the stance from the Western powers after WW2 would be relative forgiveness, rebuilding their bombed out country, and a warm welcome back into the international community, a lot of lives would’ve been spared. These days, Germany is a prosperous force for good in the world, because the rest of Western Europe who suffered at Germany’s hands had the foresight to ‘take the first step’ in rebuilding trust.

Edit, because I thought of more to say: At the end, when Namaari briefly considers taking the gems and leaving stone Raya behind, it was because she was still thinking Fang would be punished if everyone woke up. It was only Namaari pausing to consider Raya’s selfless sacrifice that convinced her to trust Raya back and allow herself to be turned to stone too.",lyj52m

cuz she was no justified in any manner. and if a villian ain't justified they die.   
just like every other villian in every other move ever. either that or put away for an eternity but she got a freaking hug! like what the actual FLIP! Raya was the only rational person in that entire universe. the fact that Sisu wanted to trust each and everyone so naive. is beyond me. even when she get's stabbed so many times in the back. like I know forgivness is good. but not to people who does not give 2 pots of \*\*\*\* about you and would never stop stabbing you in the back. it's not forgivness if you just let people trample over you again and again. at some point the forgivness stops.",lyj52m

They wanted to kidnap Sisu and get her to fix everything from inside their castle to look like the heroes instead of offering a truce and get her to go with them willingly, fix everything from inside the castle, and still look like the heroes? They couldn't have known that Sisu would trust Namaari or that she'd go without a fight.

Also the crew can't be faulted for not trusting Namaari just because the dragon said so. It's hard to apply the lesson on trust to the person who attempted to steal the gem, attempted to harm Raya multiple times, and is pointing a crossbow at them with the intention of kidnapping the last dragon because ""she had no choice"". Sisu wasn't a reliable judge of character to begin with because she has proven to be naive and was deceived several time.

And what's really sad is Namaari did little to earn her redemption. She didn't properly confront her mother. She blamed Raya for killing Sisu (granted she was stupid for grabbing at the crossbow, but Namaari was the one holding and squeezing the trigger). Then she had the gall to blame Raya for not being able to trust her when she has in no way shown she was worthy of trust (the ""dragon said so"" is not enough).",lyj52m

gq3tw9o,"which is exactly what has happened.

[Pics from the scene](https://imgur.com/a/na3jP46). In a shot before, Namaari is aiming at the dragon. Then finger on the trigger, then Raya noticing and attacking and then this shot is next. You see Namaari no longer really aiming at the dragon and then she makes a huuuge swing (like, half a meter swing) with the gun in front of her to cover her head from the sword attack that Raya made, hitting the gun, and making crossbow to fire. So, yeah.. Raya is at blame as well.

[First and last, for easy comparison](https://imgur.com/a/9aX905m). You can see that in the beginning, the crossbow is at the side. After that, you almost see it from the front (and camera is not doing some flying motion around Namaari, it goes straight (you can also see the background not changing in perspective)). So.. eeeeeven if Namaari was still aiming at the dragon, she was not aiming at the heart, but more like a leg.",lyj52m
gs1sf50,"but noone is saying that Raya is the only one in the wrong. It's about that Raya is at fault for killing the dragon as well. Yeah, Raya had her good reasons to not trust Namaari or to jump into action when saw Namaari pressing the weapon's.. cant recall the word.. you know.. the thing .. so she assessed the situation and jumped into action. All understandable. It's just that she attacked Namaari's head, instead of weapon, which resulted in Namaari instinctively cover herself with the crossbow and do a huuuuge sweeping motion (about half a meter if you look at it) from her side in front of her, which resulted in her unwantingly aiming at the dragon's heart, where also Raya's attack resulted in unwanted pull of a trigger (that's the word!). So.. even if Raya didnt attack, and let's say Namaari would shoot, it was not a shot aimed at the heart. It was at best at her leg/hand, plus on top of that Namaari wanted to bring Sisou back together with her. Not kill her.

So yeah, I'm with Namaari that Raya is partly at blame for the killing as well. She also could aim for the weapon if she wanted to divert the shot, not the head.",lyj52m

Not even live-action movies get these hair details correct!

gqi077i,"Same. I gave it a 7/10 because I felt like they built up so many things and then ran out of time to give us any kind of satisfying pay off. We didn't get nearly enough character development for Namaari. There was no pay-off on Sisu being a ""great swimmer"". There was no pay-off for the various kingdoms being visited. And Raya reuniting with her father felt super rushed and didn't really make sense - like he didn't thaw out and become human again until everyone else in the world thawed out and then trekked over to him together - he just stayed there frozen in stone on that bridge until they all arrived - and he didn't have any reaction to the fact that his daughter was 6 years older and dragons had returned.   


It felt like the animators and story writers had made a 6 hour + epic and then had to cut it down to a < 2 hour movie. Especially noticeable with some of the jarring scene transitions. The scene on the boat when Sisu is trying the spicy soup gets cut off mid-sentence with an awkward screen wipe effect to switch to Namaari silently riding through that field of stone dragons (which was beautiful and somber) which then also ended very abruptly as they switched back Raya and Sisu again immediately. It felt like that Namaari scene was supposed to be significantly longer and play a bigger role in her character arc but then got cut for time.",lyj52m

Also in the final act I realised that they were doing all this in a very compressed timeframe for literally no reason at all. The purple monster things weren’t upping their attacks or power, the dragon wasn’t losing her power.

If you have a magical thingamajig that fixes the world, you can use that to justify any moral. So, that doesn't really work as a justification for trust.

Meanwhile, we do have the other characters which could be used as an example for Raja learning to trust, but the movie mostly skips over that. 

She pays the shrimp-kid half in advance, half on arrival and after that (and a scene where they commisserate on joint loss), she seems to trust him implicitly. Same with the crime baby. After she pays them and the monkeys with rice, she implicitly trusts it as part of the team. And, once more, we see the same thing with Tong, who after a glimpse of an empty crib, is also trusted. 

None of that is really shown in the movie, Raja never fears that her team might betray her.

gq2ef9m,"Besides stating the obvious, I don't see the point in your post. We all know the main themes and messages already.

Back to the topic.

How did Namaari know about Sisu's test of trust so intimately down to almost quoting Sisu directly ? Even if she ""guessed it"" how could she be so confident on a mere hunch? How are we as a audience going to have sympathy for the hostage taker that kills the hostage? Taking a hostage at gunpoint with a deadly weapon and making demands already shows lethal intent, at this point in the movie we KNOW she *could* shoot, stressed or not.

Raya did a couple of things wrong in the movie, moving to stop Namaari was not one of them. Moving is really all she did too. She took Sisu's advice to heart and trusted her nemesis, and the nemesis lied again, and the nemesis wanted to ruin everything, and the nemesis brought a weapon and aimed it at Sisu, and the nemesis used threats of violence to get what she wanted, and the nemesis started going crazy and squeezing the trigger.

  The scenes simply doesn't show a lack of trust resulting that Raya is"" 50% responsible for killing Sisu"", there's some large gaps of both logic and emotion. 

They COULD easily have shown a different scene where Raya is being half responsible, all they had to do was moving around a few components. Simply moving to protect your friend from a shaky ""trigger finger"" isn't that.

 Mistrust and unnecessary pre-emptive actions leading to consequences is a VERY common trope in films. But that's not what was shown on the screen, period. Nothing indicated that there was any other outcome besides Namaari shooting Sisu, in fact the film seemed to suggest that this was yet another good-hearted but 'flawed' 'Trust Bomb' attempt from Sisu.",lyj52m
gq2fvpk,Folks here are agonizing over this detail in a movie where a magic glow stone OHKO’s the entire threat at the end. Some things are deliberately ambiguous (like the trigger pull) and resolved quickly afterward because it’s a children’s movie with a close to 2 hour run time. Majority of folks are going to get what they were trying to present to the audience in terms of theme without an explicit confrontation and conversation about it that would have dragged out the conclusion. I believe this movie could have been a series or a couple movies instead to cover everything more fulsomely (and add more cool scenes in each of the nations) but I don’t have too many major hang ups about the resolution myself.,lyj52m

So Sisu tells us early on that the Druun are essentially embodied human discord, and that they are the opposite of the dragons.

When Sisu and her family ward off the Druun, they do so by embodying the power of trust... but they aren't humans, and they can't defeat human discord without the cooperation of humans themselves. Unfortunately humanity rejects the dragons' sacrifice, because despite everything they continue to embrace discord after the dragons are gone. This is why the dragons (who embody trust) can't return the first time. So long as the humans fail to trust one another, they will be plagued by the Druun, and the dragons will be unable to return.

Sisu, trusted by her siblings, shares this lesson about the importance of trust with all of the people she meets during the movie. It's only when the humans finally learn to embrace trust that they are able to defeat discord, and the dragons can finally return.

Something like that.",lyj52m

grvj11l,"Druun are born from human discord and arguments. The dragons came together for humanity and tried to hold off the Druun themselves but without a united mankind it was a failing fight. This led to the final stand where the gem was crafted, the line couldn't be held. So while Sisu and her closest siblings were the only ones left they used the remaining aura to make the stone and used Sisu's magic to seal the lock essentially locking the Druun within. Humanity is saved from the Druun, they splinter into groups and begin warring/vying for power. The gem is broken and the lock is opened for the Druun and there are no dragons to help. 

My theory is that the dragons needed humanity to completely destroy the Druun, since they were created by human discord. Humanity never came toghether back then and dragons could only seal the Druun. With Raya and her friends from each region coming together and trusting in one another to ""reforge"" the stone the ritual was completed. Those turned to stone dragon and otherwise were normal again

Raya is equally to blame. I didnt read it any different during that scene. If they wanted Raya not be at blame, then they should have done it so. But they did not.

But I think the realest moment in the movie; the one that I knew was going to happen was when the chieftain called for peace and unity in the circle and in response, somebody shot him in the leg. I think the movie’s message is one that is trying to make a commentary on how divided our world is, but I think in the end it underestimates the cruelty and hatred people harbor for people who don’t think and look like them.

EDIT: I suppose I should maybe concede that this is a Disney movie and they can’t be too hard on the deep roots of prejudice that people hold, but when it’s a core theme of the movie, I think it ought to have been addressed in a more profound way.

grx6lbw,">Druun are born from human discord and arguments

Which implies that humans never had discord or arguments before the events of the backstory, because that makes sense. On a side note, it's a really shitty lesson to teach kids that discord and arguments are, for lack of better terms, evil. That's not how the world works. If you're not willing to have discord and arguments, people are going to trample all over you.

>The dragons came together for humanity

I understand why you say that, because the movie itself says it, but it doesn't really make much sense. The Druun were destroying the entire world, including the dragons. Of course the dragons would fight back?

> This led to the final stand where the gem was crafted, the line couldn't be held. Sisu and her closest siblings were the only ones left they used the remaining aura to make the stone and used Sisu's magic to seal the lock essentially locking the Druun within. 

What line? I'm honestly not sure how to approach this scene, because it doesn't make any sense. The Druun aren't attacking them because they got a ring of water around them. The Druun are shown as trying to cross the water, touching it, and retreating. Then Pengu takes a bit of water from a puddle in the middle and makes the stone together with the others, after which they give it to Sisu. Then the Druun, somehow, cross the water with no problem and turn the dragons to stone, while the dragons are just letting it happen, and while the Druun are ignoring Sisu. And if the latter is because Sisu is holding the stone, doesn't that mean if they had literally just huddled together, they'd have been fine? Sisu also explicitly says that any of them could've used the stone. Why didn't they? Why didn't Pengu just immediately use it? Why did they opt to be turned to stone? And Sisu' magic? What magic? Her magic is to ""swim well."" Are you saying that she was lying and her actual magic was... what? To use the stone? Why would she lie? Or did she not know? Why didn't she know? Did the other dragons know? Did they know what they were doing? How would they know and not Sisu? Why didn't they tell her?

 And she didn't ""lock the Druun within."" The scene where she explains them makes it out to be that they always exist in the background and were merely kept in place by the power of the stone. Speaking of which, why did they take so long to make the stone in the first place? They could easily defeat the threat by sacrificing the magic of a few dragons. Were the dragons too selfish to do so earlier? Nothing about it makes any sense.

>Humanity is saved from the Druun, they splinter into groups and begin warring/vying for power.

Where was Sisu during all of this? Where did she go? Why did she go?


>My theory is that the dragons needed humanity to completely destroy the Druun, since they were created by human discord. 

The problem being that their creation is never explained. How are they created by human discord? We don't even get something like a chi system that's influenced by emotions, we just get a vague line. What about the dragons? Aren't they capable of disagreeing with each other?

>Humanity never came toghether back then and dragons could only seal the Druun.

If humans were needed to do so, why did the dragon magic work at all? And why did that free the humans and not the dragons, as opposed to the other way around?

>With Raya and her friends from each region coming together and trusting in one another to ""reforge"" the stone the ritual was completed.

Why does it matter who's from where? Do they suddenly represent their nations just because they happen to be from there? Does the mysterious trust magic care where people were born? Doesn't that kind of validate the breaking of the world into discrete nations, which is portrayed negatively in the beginning, because it's implying that they are indeed tangibly different.

>The idea of Kumandra is central to the movie in that broken parts come together to make a greater whole. Kumandra was achieved

When Elsa realizes she’s the 5th spirit it’s not clear what that means. Has there been other human avatars of the elements before? 

There was way too many simultaneous plots going on. Kristoffs proposal, the people in the magic village, Olaf’s crisis with growing older. Their parents back story and origin of their disappearance. Taming the elements. And not all of them had payoff. What was the real reason she had to tame those elements? Why include the kristoffs Anna subplot when you know it’s gonna end in a proposal and instead just draaag it out. 

I don’t think that trying to answer every question the fans have instantly makes a good sequel. It has to serve the story. Whereas in this movie the movie served to answer questions. 

Kristoffs song is awful, unnecessary, stops the movie dead and is for lack of a better term...cringey. 

The pacing definitely suffered with all this stuff going on. Pacing is huge in what makes a good movie. They really tried to fit in too much which demands switching your attention to 12 different plots every scene which kills the pacing. 

Overall the movie needed clear themes and foreshadowing like the first. It felt like it was about grief, and growing older, and change, and finding yourself, but also that you’ve already found yourself, and guilt, and one sided relationships. And none of it was satisfying.",lyj52m

The morals themselves are bloody contradictory. If Raya's naive, incompetent dad hadn't been so trusting, NONE OF IT would've happened. Guy couldn't even have been assed to post some damn guards around the temple when he's inviting hostile and covetous nations to a meeting.

And the magic makes no a single lick of sense. Why does trust matter? Why did it have to be Sisu? Did they only trust Sisu? Did they not trust each other? Why didn't the stone un-petrify the dragons the first time but did so the second? The problems just keep pilling up!",lyj52m
gs1zofa,"I literally never said that it's *entirely* Raya's fault, so chill the hell out already lol. I'm simply saying what Namaari already pointed out, that Raya is just as at fault as her for what happened. The whole point here is that everyone in this movie thinks that they are the main character, so having Namaari apologize wouldn't make any sense when she thinks she doesn't anything wrong, similar to how Raya thinks she doesn't have to apologize either for her own actions thus far. Everyone thinks they're justified, and in Namaari's case you need to take into account her upbringing for why she even betrayed Raya in the first place.

1. Her mother is the head of a dangerous & cunning village that will do anything to survive in whatever they think is the best option. Which is no different from the other village's mentalities.

2. Her village was poverty stricken before she & her mother attained a piece of the dragon gem, she literally pointed this out at the start of the film. So Heart village was the only thriving village whilst the others had to get desperate.

3. Namaari is being raised to become the next village head of Fang, which means that she is raised by a bad parent that's been telling her that there no way anyone can trust anyone. Contrast that with Raya who was taught that trust is key & is necessary. Namaari is just what would happen if Raya didn't have a good upbringing.

And in case you didn't notice, she did give a damn. Dragons in this movie are treated as the indisputable right, and because of that humans trust the dragons more than they will ever trust other humans. So whenever Namaari is shown to give a damn and is willing to question her mother, it's because of a dragon.

**Tl:Dr - quit blaming Namaari when you know damn well its truly her mother's fault that all this shit happened.** Whenever you have badly raised child, you don't blame the child, you blame the person who raised them. Whenever you have a bad student, you don't blame the student, you blame the teacher. Pretty sure the Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi said something similar to that effect.",lyj52m

> She was already pulling the trigger when Raya tried to intervene.

No she wasn't.

> Now intervening with someone who has a projectile weapon pointed at another does run the risk of causing what you wish to avoid. But doing nothing seems worse to me IMO.

Naturally, if only Raya hadn't caused her to pull the trigger

> I will also quote gun people in that you should never point your weapon at someone unless you intend to shoot. So if you were just talking, point it at the ground. 

Pointing it at the ground isn't really going to help in getting everyone to listen to her demands. She only did so because she wasn't how to carry on through with the mission her mother gave her.

> BTW where was the earlier wonder and deference? Why wasn't the plan to appear in front the Queen while she addressed her subjects and shame her into complying?

Why the fuck would Namaari do that to her mother when she's still under the impression that her mother's actions are the right ones? That's like asking why doesn't the righthand man of a dictator force said dictator into complying with a surrender of their power 🤣 even though that righthand man hasn't recognized the problem with supporting them.

> Where was the Fang outreach after the calamity that they caused? Don't see any owning it.

Do you mean outrage? Because an outreach wouldn't make any sense. And last I checked, there was an outrage, from Raya, because every other village benefited greatly from Fangs actions whearas Heart didn't. And if there was an outrage at the end of the film it would just show that the village still don't trust each other. The only thing that should happened is that the queen of fang step down.

> Where was Namaari's apology? ""Sorry I shot you should be cheap to say"". 

I guess you didn't see the part where she humbly bowed down to Sisu after she was revived then, wherein Sisu accepted that apology and acted like it was all water under the bridge by forcing Namaari into their group hug. 

> Love how the story makes Raya the villain.

It literally did not do that, it just showed that she can be wrong too, like every other character except the dragons.

> Hey people TEACH YOU HOW to TREAT THEM!

Okay...?

> Oh and the moral of the story really is that people are only decent when the dragons are around. Only when magic walks the earth will we do the right thing.

gq3ff98,"Yes, there was a shot she was pulling it, but we dont know if she would actually pull it. This is such a cliché shot already that it is common to show this in movies and then have character not pull it at all. And with Namari having the connection with the dragon, it looked that she wont pull it. And if she would not, well in that case, Raya is at fault of making it shoot too.

Of course Raya saw that Namari is pulling the trigger, thus throwing the sword to make her not pull it, but! exactly this made her pull it.. it made Namari do what she most likely wouldnt do.

So yes, Raya is at equal fault, too. Namari is not even aiming at the dragon when the sword is flying to her head. Raya makes her move the weapon to aim at the dragon, and with the hit it makes her pull the trigger with the muscle tension. Without Raya attacking, Namari would not have pulled the trigger from how it is showed in the movie.

So yes again. Namari brought the crossbow and prepared to use it. So yes, partly blame is hers. She then hesitated, stopped aiming at the dragon, Raya attacked and made Namari move the weapon and with the sword hit, the shot was fired involutarily. So here is Raya's part of the blame.

As I probably mentioned. If you want to make Raya innocent, Namari should have shoot on her own. But she did not do that. She fired the shot only when Raya make her do it on accident.

Is part of the blame for the shot fired and hostage being shot, cop's fault too? Or is it just all criminal's fault for bringing a weapon? 

I'm no judge, but I am not sure it would be seen 100% as the pure fault of the criminal, if the cop's action made the criminal shoot his weapon in the first place. 

There is a debate.. would he, would he not? But what happened is that he surely did after cop intervened. 

And Raya intervened the way that made Namaari **aim** at the heart of Sisou and shoot involuntarily. Even if Namaari still shot without Raya, it was not aimed at the heart. Did Namaari even wanted to kill the dragon? Wasnt she ordered to bring it alive? Rewatching the scene, and that is indeed what she was ordered. Bring in the dragon to help them. So.. excuse me, but what would be the purpose of killing the last dragon, if they needed it to help them? So.. another reason for why Namaari didnt want to kill Sisou.. yeah, she was aiming at her, but not at the heart.. injure, to be able to take her? Sure. But kill? No. Not to mention, even the movie is aware of Raya's fault as well. As Namaari says. Which is true. Raya is partly at blame, as well.",lyj52m

So, even if she was aiming at Sisu at the first pic, it was not a heart shot. You can see Namaari making huge sweeping motion and see crossbow entirely from the side in the beginning and then almost fully from the front in the end (and the camera is not circling around, just going closer)

Reaction shot of Raya distressed throwing out dialogue.  Reaction shot of Namaari throwing out dialogue.  Then Sisu throws out a platitude. Then close up on the trigger being slowly pulled.  Then medium shot of Raya using her sword to disarm Namaari.  That is how it went down.  Next Namaari's mother didn't instruct her to threaten the Dragon with physical harm, that was a tactical decision.  Her mother gave her broad strokes to lure in the suckers and then dispatch whomever needed dispatching and take the Dragon.  That was the strategy as always tactics are up to the operator (Namaari).  You misunderstood my next point due to my bad writing.  My speculation wasn't assuming that Namaari would switch sides, she is irredeemable and only the most extreme circumstances force her into big picture thinking.  My conjecture was for Sisu.  Sisu being a defacto deity could have appeared before the masses in public and instructed the Queen.  She would have no choice.  Since the Queen was a Jafar type, she didn't need an evil Prime Minister to whisper in her ear to ignore the situation.  ""I am the great Sisu give me my gem and I will guarantee your safety"" something like that...  You also misunderstood my next point which was after the Fang tribe created their paradise why didn't they offer the olive branch to other tribes (outreach) to get them onboard with the new normal?  America does this all the time, bomb the crap out of someone and then offer to help them clean the rubble.  Next point saluting a soldier when he is staring at you and thanking him for his service after you were talking trash about how he was stupid to volunteer is not an apology.  An apology consists of getting attention naming the thing you are sorry for and communicating with words and actions that you are sorry.  This is like an Atheist meeting Jesus in a coffee shop.  Praying isn't the go to move.  Sorry I didn't believe in you, I will pray now.  That's more like the speed.  People spent more effort trying to dissuade Raya from her path than chastised Namaari for playing a key role in starting this entire mess.  Raya was rational at all times and only tripped up trying to apply her fathers' flawed logic.  If he wanted to achieve his stated goal he should have offered more than a meal.  He could have unilaterally provided rice in exchange for whatever Fang produced (even if it was just ninjas).  Also seems like the other countries needed water.

>Also if this movie is supposed to culminate in Raya trusting Namaari, why are they apart the entire movie?

The movie is once again completely contradictory. The message is that we have to trust one another, but it's because Raya is initially so trusting that...

Oh bloody hell, I just realized a *different* problem. Raya, as a child, makes no sense either! She goes from ""all right, let's kill us some people!"" to ""hey stranger from the nation of backstabbers! Let us be friends and lemme show you our most sacred artifact that you undoubtedly want!"" in the span of five bloody minutes! Why was she even so bloodthirsty in the beginning when her dad seems like the biggest idealist in the entire movie? How the hell did that happen?

But yeah, she trusts Namaari, gets betrayed, trusts her later, gets betrayed, and then trusts her again, because the big blue dragon told her to. What kind of nonsense is that? No, you should NOT trust those who readily betray you, especially when you don't even bloody know them! I'd be surprised if they even interacted with each other for a total of 1 hour throughout the timespan of the movie.

> Shouldn't the central relationship that gets explored theirs and not with some random dragon?

A dragon who was repeatedly shown to be wrong and extremely naive. The message is so damn muddled. If you're supposed to trust each other, WHY did they have a scene where that, explicitly, did not work? 

Of course, in the real world, we should trust SOME people and distrust OTHER people. It's not black and white. In the movie, we are SHOWN the same thing, but TOLD differently.

>And if Sisu is such a big unifying force, why the hell would Raya keep her a secret anyway? 

To be fair, I would hide Sisu as well. She would surely find some way to fuck everything up.

Of course, we can debate if it is fifty fifty fault, but still, both parties would have some blame at them. Although Raya thought she is doing a good deed.. which backfired. But still, she has part in it, especially if Namaari was at the end aiming sideways. Which is clear from the pictures.. sideways vs almost full front aim (which Raya has caused)",lyj52m
gqb4uxf,"I am not saying Raya should not be on guard. I am just saying what happened.. and that is, Raya helping to shoot Sisou.

If we are at cop and criminal, let's look at it.

Criminal is aiming at the hostage. A cop is standing there, watching. The cop sees the criminal pulling a trigger, but the criminal is really hesitating to the point he is not gonna do it. But since the cop is suspicious he is trying to save the hostage and defuse the situation by reverting the gun aimed at him. So the cop throws his knife to the head of the criminal. What happens is that in that very moment, the criminal was aiming sideways from the hostage, and when he saw a knife flying to his head, he moved his hands to protect himself.. did a huuuge sweeping motion about half a meter. It hits his hands and gun.. the trigger is pulled, the weapon is shot. This shot hits the hostage into the heart.

Now.. who is at the blame? Purely the criminal? Not really, because he was not aiming at the heart at the moment of cop's attack. But cop's attack resulted in him reflexively protect himself, and this cop's knife hit caused 1. weapon to be moved to the position of aiming at the heart, 2. weapon to be fired.

So yeah, cop tried to do the best he thought of at that moment, but nevertheless, despite all that, the gun was shot (now due to him) and the hostage was hit (to the heart, where the aim was not at the moment of attack).

I dunno, but do you really think in the judging process, the cop would not be seen as partly in blame for how it all turned out? Did you see many times, even in movies, the standouts where cop is standing against a criminal who is aiming his gun at a hostage, and the cop is ordered not to shoot, cause it might cause the criminal to shoot? Now.. if the cop shoot and that makes a criminal shoot.. is all the blame only on a criminal, cause he brought the gun? Even you surely see that it's a bit ridiculous notion.. and if the cop shoot and that makes the criminal shoots, the cop carries part of the blame for what happened as well. No? 

I dont deny that in that moment it might have been the best solution, or seemed as the best solution, but that doesnt change the fact that it happened this way due to him, not solely due to criminal.",lyj52m

Edit: This convo has my gears turning.

That would’ve given Namaari the satisfying act of defiance against her mother we all wanted, and also given her mother an equally juicy reaction when she realizes she has been wrong to distrust Raya this whole time.

Namaari then tries to deflect the blame and say Raya is to blame. It's like someone robbing a store with a gun and then blames someone for moving when they shoot them. The movie then takes Namaari's clear denial of responsibility as fact when it was the final clear evidence that Namaari isn't to be trusted. In another interpretation, the lesson Raya learned in the end was that Namaari will always be selfish and self serving and so the only way to fix things is to literally sacrifice herself and trust Namaari because there's no way the reverse will ever happen. The message of the movie is twisted into ""if you're dealing with people who will never compromise and routinely backstab you for their own interests, you have to lay down your lives and hope they do the right thing"" and then it turns out those people never suffer any consequences.

I agree to a point, it really is important what kind of teacher you have, which I actually referred to in my comment, but does she have no agency over her own actions because her mommy told her to do it? She's about 18, I'd say that an 18 year old is old enough to be responsible for their actions, and even if they do something because their mom told them to, in the end it's still their decision to actually follow through.

Lastly, I didn't say that it needed to try to be realistic in every aspect, but kids actually *do* learn morals from cartoons, so saying that  you ""shouldn't care about the message anyways because it's just a kid movie lolol"" is pretty irresponsible, when the message of the movie seems to be to blindly trust people, even if they've already betrayed you once.

Namaari is right.. Raya did really help her kill the dragon. Might be not 50/50 blame, but 40/60, or 30/70 if we stretch it. Raya tried to save Sisou, but did a poor job at that and that lead to her killing.

but.. that's not true.. especially since, indeed, Raya is really partly at blame.

It's not only a fault of a person who bring the weapon. I mean.. imagine the scenario that someone bring a pistol to the party.

But there is a blame on him for bringing the weapon, which is entirely fair and entirely his fault. But the shot itself? Well, if he wasnt attacked and made to pull the trigger against his will, due to action of someone else.. that some else is partly at fault here too, since he made the action that led to the shot being fired. because then we can argue that you can do whatever if someone else is armed, even if it leads to killing other people, you are free of guilt because another person brought the weapon in.

gu8u40x,Were we watching the same movie? Namari would definitely have put the crossbow down had Raya actually listened to Sisu. You can see it from the moment Namari saw Sisu that she loved her more than anything and would rather die than harm her. Sisu saw that and told Raya to trust her. Something Raya agreed to do but still couldn't let it go. Raya's distrust was also a betrayal of her word to Sisu and cost Sisu her life. Namari clearly hated herself for what she did but she understood that Raya was also at fault. Something Raya doesn't take responsibility for.,lyj52m
gq8d7h5,"You're forgetting the reason behind her arc, which is the same reason everyone else has. She's distrustful because of what she has lost by trusting others. The other characters she runs with all of context-fitting lifestyles that make Raya not want to trust them at first glance but learn to thanks to Sisu. The baby is from a country that swindles people like its nothing. The kid has spent a good part of his life having to fend for himself. The brute has had to hide how he feels because opening up makes him vulnerable to being betrayed. And I don't think I need to explain Raya. They've all had to close up their hearts and be less willing to trust others who don't sympathize or empathize with their own experiences. Sisu is the only reason they were willing to work with each other in the first place but because she nature leads to her being naive, Raya will still reprimand her where necessary. Raya doesn't blindly trust any of the people who helped her, not those who helped nothing to lose and everything to gain by simply helping her, and not when she literally knows about each of their respective backstories. It's not inconsistent at all. They're not working together because of Raya they're working together because of Sisu.",lyj52m

YES! Of course they are! They are the only person who would be punished. I don't really see the point of continuing this discussion because I don't even know how to bridge this gap. If someone brings a gun to a party and starts swinging it around wildly, the people who try to stop them aren't prosecuted for it in any country I know of.

> Raya meets and trusts boun, but why? bc he didn't poison food like she thought? Weak reasoning. 

Nope, it's because Sisu trusts Boun, Raya is still cautious of him until she gets to know him. 

> The baby is worse - the baby robs her, and then she feels pity for the baby, and TRUSTS the baby to distract some guards and then invites them on the boat. WHY? That baby did nothing to earn trust. So I would say Raya is blindly trusting here. 

Except she didn't need to yet, just like with Boun, Raya was using Noi to get what she wanted and after she was successful and understood where Noi was coming from, she and Sisu invited her to join. She's not blindly trusting Noi at all, especially its treated like a back-and-forth kind of thing where as soon as she opens herself up to trusting others it either immediately backfires and gives her a reason not to trust people, or it works out for her and it turns out Sisu sort of had a point. 

> And then Raya yells at Sisu for trusting people (the old lady). Raya can't act trusting of baby and then not trusting of others... especially at this time in her arc, when she is still learning to trust. 

That's exactly how an arc is supposed to work tho? Thats standard heroes journey stuff dude. She's beginning to open up and see more and more of how Sisu may be right, but she's also experiencing situations where Sisu is clearly wrong. 

> And the big guy, Raya, again, feels pity when she sees he is alone and lost his family... but EVERYONE has lost family. Why does she trust him?

Not everyone tho, again, Namari hasn't is thus a bigger problem than the brute has ever been since she was captured. She doesn't trust him at all and clearly asked the others to get Sisu to safety while she makes a distraction, he's the one who later asks to join because Sisu revealed herself. And he's only allowed to join because he's an idiot and is in no way capable of double crossing them if he really wanted to. They make that pretty clear when they're captured by him and ask him what he plans to do with them. His answer? He literally has no idea. 

> No one knows that Sisu is a dragon, and had limited interaction with her up to this point, so i don't even buy that they really feel connected to her in her human form either. And yet, we're supposed to buy that they are some kind of family together

They never once act like a family though, hell, they act about as much a family as the GoTG does in the second act of their first movie, like you later mention. If they acted like some tight nit family they would have done more to get to know each other. The brute puts more effort into learning Noi's name than everyone else does... And he literally just joined the group lol. It's no different from how bounty hunters in The Mandalorian pinky swear to not betray each other when they have every opportunity to. 

Now comes the part where I actually do agree with you. 

>  I would have maybe agreed with you more if we were allowed to see the relationships grow, but bc this was a movie and not a tv show, it all happened way too fast

Yup I fully agree with you here. The work would have worked a lot better if it were just a TV show. Not only would it have helped flesh out the world building, but the characters too.

> (although, Guardians of the Galaxy was able to pull it off, and that ending rang a bit more true, even though it was like, the same ending, down to the purple fog/goo)

(well sure, if you ignore the fact that the enemy in that movie was an angry, roided up, dictator of a smurf who was causing the problems, needing to be stopped by the group who might have ended up killing themselves by touching raw energy... as opposed to a bunch of purple blobs that will just turn the group into stone if they don't tape a broken rock together and trust that other person won't fuck it up. Keep in mind that GoTG has a bit of longer runtime and dedicates a lot of it to having the group play keep away with the big bad, which is what grows their trust in each other. Here, it's a constant bank heist after bank heist plot with those affiliated learning more about each other each time they get a piece of what they all want)",lyj52m

But there's no way you or Raya could have known that. If I'm pointing a weapon at someone, I'm shaking and clearly putting pressure on the trigger, and on top of that there's only a small difference in direction between me grievously injuring someone and killing them...the situation doesn't look good for your argument. 

We know that in the real world, you don't try to aim at someone's weapon, you aim for them. Your entire argument makes no moral sense, goes against all civilised systems of law, and directly contradicts how people are taught to act in these situations in the real world.

gqc54nd,"Which of course the movie has shown to be a consistently bad idea along with trusting Namaari in particular. She trusted Sisu to the point where she decided to give Namaari a second chance, at which point they were betrayed by her once again. She trusted Sisu to try and convince Namaari, at which point Namaari pointed her crossbow at Sisu and was squeezing the trigger.

Namaari says Raya is as much to blame as her because Raya didn't trust Sisu. Namaari, the person who backstabbed Sisu and pointed at weapon at her specifically to threaten her with it. It's complete madness and clearly something you'd say if you were in denial.",lyj52m
gqbavws,"Hah, that's a great point too! But I suppose people would argue that ""she was already betrayed, so she didnt trust her, so brought the weapon ""just in case"""", but yeah.. a peaceful meeting so Raya brought it, Namaari brought it too. Then I suppose they might argue ""But Raya didnt intend to use it!"", which we can argue that Namaari didnt intend as well (though trigger was being pulled, but Namaari didnt wanna do it.. and anyway, was not trying to kill her, at best harm her, since she wanted to bring her back to her mother).

gqcd0pa,"I suppose yeah.. when put like that and when you can time freeze the movie and go frame by frame. 

If you brought a weapon to a gathering and aimed it at someone and there came to an accident (e.g. someone kicks a ball and it hits the guy with a weapon, which fires out), blame would be at the guy who brought the weapon. (although tiny little tiniest bit would go to the person who kicked the ball but it would not be really his fault per se). Yeah.. I see. I dunno.. I suppose I was more focused on how it was showed.. a cliche pulling of trigger which wouldnt be pulled, Raya bringing weapon to a meeting as well and then when situation needed it, she attacks the head, instead of weapon, this resulting in weapon being moved to aim at the heart. DUnno.. in how it was portrayed I felt like it was Raya's fault at part too, same like Namaari has felt. 

But I still think that if they wanted it be better and more clear, they should have either make Namaari shoot first while Raya ""blindly trusted her again"", or better.. have Raya try to throw a sword to avert the shot, but the trigger would be pulled sooner, so it was clear that Raya tried but too late.. instead of Raya tried and that resulted in a kill. Which really just makes it feel like Raya had a little bit of part in the killing as well.",lyj52m
gqcc6fp,"Well, obviously I have no idea if in the whole world and its history there was such a case. But I find it hard to believe that it would be so easy to defend yourself with ""Your honor, the criminal was pulling the trigger, so I made the decision to stop him by attacking at his head, which made him move the weapon from aiming at the arm, and thus pointing at heart when he fired the shot."" I mean.. of course you would not go to jail (most likely) cause you were trying to do the right thing and save the person and incapacitate the criminal. Of course it was your responsibility and something you had almost no time to judge and this seemed like the best decision to do. Made it was the best decision to do and it could not end any other way. But the thing stays, that even despite all the tries to save the person, the shot was made and partly due to you attacking. Without attacking, the shot would be maybe made regardless, but your goal was to either avert the shot or make it so the shot is not being made at all. But, the averting resulted in aiming at the worse place than if you did nothing. So.. despite trying your best, the result would be shot fired. But without you, it would be the arm, not the heart. Now.. you tried your best, but you cant say that the changed trajectory of the shot isnt a teeny tiny bit on you too. Instead of arm it was heart. And it was heart because your way of defense was to attack at the head, instead of pushing weapon away. 

So.. yeah.. okay. I see. 50/50 it is surely not. But.. there is still part of the blame, since the trajectory changed due to you interfering. So.. let's end it at 10/90.. or 20/80 (maybe a bit more, cause if this was a real scenario, you'd most likely think about it your whole life that it was your attack at the head that resulted in the hand being moved to aim at the heart and you'd feel a bit guilt too)

**EDIT:** anyway, yeah.. I guess I'm starting to stretch it and we are just walking in a circle. 

What would be the best, imo, would be to make Raya throw a sword (btw, she also brought a weapon to the gathering), but show us Namaari actually pulling the trigger sooner, so despite Raya trying to rescue Sisu, it would be a smidge too late.. instead of her hitting the weapon first, which makes Namaari accidentaly shoot it.",lyj52m
