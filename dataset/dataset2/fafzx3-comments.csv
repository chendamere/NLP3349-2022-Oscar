fj19sl9,"FINALLY!!!!!i have been waiting for a discussion for this film on this sub for soooooo long. i’ll echo my comment on r/truefilm on the bonfire scene, which has been steadily becoming one of my favorite scenes in movies of all time. the use of acapella to build tension. the way the scene climax when they *finally* make eye contact. héloïse’s dress catches on fire; they realize theyre in love. héloïse looks down and sees her burning dress and does nothing but accept it; accept their love despite all the implications that comes with it. she ignores how incredibly inappropriate their love was at that time and how she already knew it could only end in pain. i love it so much and how it reuses old clichés of fire = passion/love and make something that feels completely new in how well made it was. 

theres this haunting image of héloïse in her wedding dress that appears more than once after they kiss, and not only is this as a callback to the tale of orpheus (héloïse disappears every time marianne turns around to look at her until she finally does disappear for real and their love is lost forever) but it is also a heartbreaking reminder to the both of them that they’ll never be happy even when theyre together due to the looming dread of her eventual but certain marriage. its the acknowledgement of their unhappy ending by the character herself that breaks me. 

im so fucking happy that this movie exists and really do feel like its a once-in-a-generation kind of film for me.",fafzx3
fj3397d,"The last scene is going to stick with me for a long time. 

The most effective part is it's not just pure sobbing. She smiles for a moment, even as the tears pour, she's feeling every emotion as she listens and remembers. It just breaks my fucking heart, even weeks after having seen it.",fafzx3
fj2z2ko,"Man - the acapella at the bonfire spooked me when it first started. I purposely didn’t read anything before seeing the movie and I was worried that it was going to take a hard left into Midsommar/The VVitch territory.

fj5l8pz,"Finally able to share my thoughts with a wider audience now that the discussion is live. I caught this early January.

As a straight male, this movie resonated with me in ways unimaginable.

I don't think its recency bias in the slightest, but as soon as the credits started to roll, wiping the flood of uncontrollable tears, I thought to myself: *""Yup. This is one of the most beautifully moving films I have ever experienced and an immediate Top 5 favorite of mine.""*

So much is said without anything every being said; the film is its loudest, most loving, and most intelligent in its quietest moments. The scenes between Marianne and Heloise during their sessions, especially the one where Heloise questions ""And who do I look at?"" were magnetic despite being such tender, whisper-soft moments.

There are several scenes that are still imprinted in my mind that I cannot shake, but, above all, those final 10 minutes, but more so those final 4 minutes, during the orchestra, as the music swells and we see a range of emotion play out on her face...it's unreal.

This film was beautiful, and everyone should really do their best to experience it.",fafzx3
fizc6z8,">""Why doesn't she smile.""

> ""Perhaps because you aren't funny.

>*next time Marianne and Heloise are together*

>""So do you think your sister wanted to die."" 

Damn I need to step up my flirt game.",fafzx3
fizdn8b,The scene where Marianne and Heloise kind of taunt each other by informing the other of their tells is a great new example of an incredibly hot scene with no sex in it.,fafzx3
fizm5ys,"I went into the film expecting it to primarily be about the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse, and it mostly was. But I was also pleasantly surprised how big of a part of the movie Sophie was. The abortion scene with her lying on the bed next to the little kid was utterly gripping, and I loved how much of the film was centered on the interactions between all three of them.",fafzx3
fj2fbh0,When we were zoomed in on Heloise at the end I half expected Visions of Gideon to start playing. Like yeah queer movie where they don’t end up together but same guy punch that hurts so good,fafzx3

fizs87a,"I read somewhere that the director said she wanted to show consent with their first kiss. But openly asking for it wasn’t that romantic and break the flow of the scene for people. So she made them cover their mouths. Lifting the covers meant they were giving their consent. I’ll try to find the article.

Edit: I couldn't find the one I read but found these:

>“[R](https://www.advocate.com/film/2019/12/19/portrait-lady-fires-female-gaze-fight-against-convention)[egarding](https://www.advocate.com/film/2019/12/19/portrait-lady-fires-female-gaze-fight-against-convention) eroticism, it was all the eroticism of consent. The first kiss scene is shot like that. They both unveil their mouths. They're both saying yes to this, and this is new and sexy,” Sciamma says. “This is not like the usual scene. Each time somebody touched somebody, they asked.” 

&#x200B;

>[And](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/19/21137213/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-celine-sciamma-interview) also, the movie is fully about consent and how consent is also super erotic and super sexy. Sophie, even though she went through this, she’s being asked what she wants. And each time they touch each other, they never touch each other without asking first. We tried to make it very mutual.",fafzx3
fopt5e0,"I was wondering why the didn't choose to be lovers above all else and just abandon everything. The move answered this. She asked her to turn around at the end, they chose the ending of poets not lovers.",fafzx3
fjpxywc,"I had a strong initial reaction that Celine Sciamma made a mistake with the ending. I really believed she should have cut the movie off after Marianne turns around. So many movies seem to meander and linger long after the emotional weight of the climax has completely dissipated. The Coen Brothers often feel like the only directors that understand abrupt endings are incredibly powerful if done right.

 Seeing the movie again I now realize that reaction was wrong and bad and Sciamma is smarter and a much better writer than I am.",fafzx3
flt1tvx,“Turn around.” That scene where Marianne finally sees Heloise in the wedding dress in real life is going to haunt me for a long time.,fafzx3
fizgfzz,I absolutely love how every single frame of this film looks like it could be a painting. Sciamma has an amazing eye for that.,fafzx3
fj0oebj,This falls into my exact favourite romantic genre where >!the last 10 minutes are a devastating timeskip that makes me want to die.!< The slow-burn investment into their relationship is so worth it. There were several times where I think I just straight up stopped breathing.,fafzx3
fizbr6p,"This is one of those amazing films where I thought it was okay but then the more I thought about it the more scenes just kept replaying in my mind and now I love it. The image of the faceless portrait, burning from the heart. The musical chant and the fiery dress. The haunting image of Heloise in her wedding dress. The tender kiss.

Of course the best thing is the way the film pays off so brilliantly in the final two scenes. I can't believe a page number in a portrait could make me cry but the film has earned that brilliant catharsis. And of course the final shot, insanely acted by  Adèle Haenel but also a beautiful portrait of the way art that has informed our lives changes the way we interact with it.

Goddamn what an incredible movie.",fafzx3
fj2bwpv,They just gave the Cesar to Polanski instead of Sciamma. End me.,fafzx3
fizcdf9,"France really fucked themselves over by not submitting this for Best International Feature. It's far superior to Les Miserables and I think would have been a worthy rival to Parasite.

Gorgeous film through and through. Beautifully somber, subtle screenplay about forbidden love. The performances are breathtakingly good - that Adele Haenel is straight up angelic in this. The cinematography, production design, costume design were all top notch. One of the best directed movies of 2019, everyone should see it at least once!",fafzx3
fjmgj26,"Seeing the ending of this film in theaters is an experience I will never forget. I became so locked into that last shot, that at some point I had gotten tunnel vision and I realized I wasn’t breathing. And when it finally cut to black there was this amazing moment where I noticed that no one else, in a packed theater, was breathing either. Complete and devastating silence resonated in my ears and when the credits finally appeared, I broke down. I’m a straight male, and I never felt anything like that before. This is one of those films that transcends its own sexuality into a universal message of memory, regret, passion, loneliness, seclusion, etc. I could go on, but I’ve thought about this film every day since I saw it three weeks ago. A masterpiece.",fafzx3
fmmxuue,"Fucking loved this.  

My soul left my body when they showed the little 28 in the new portrait.  We're watching Marianne come to terms with her regret and her heart breaking all over again when they decide to flip it on us.  It honestly made me feel shit.",fafzx3
fizqddk,"I don't know how to properly explain this and I wonder how many of you felt the same - this is by far the sexiest movie that I have seen that didn't portray women as sex objects. You have these undeniably attractive women doing extremely erotic things and yet I never looked at them thinking - ""Yeah, this is meant to activate my pleasure centers"". Even though reading the screenplay I probably wouldn't have had the same reaction. So congratulations to Sciamma for being able to showcase romance in that way - she rewired my male brain, at least for two hours.

Also one of the best looking movies I've seen - puts other movies to shame.",fafzx3
fj02j56,"Other than the love story, which was very delicately handled and portrayed, I really liked how the movie depicted female friendship, or rather closeness. 

When the mother leaves, the young mistress, the hired painter and the servant remain alone in the big mansion and it’s like a veil is lifted from all their lives. The class bonds sort of dissipate and they eat together, work and sew together, move freely, the two upper-class women go out of their way to assist the lowly girl when she needs help. 

I think it’s a huge credit to Sciamma that this shift looks natural instead of far-fetched, warm and powerful but without any contrived YAY SISTERHOOD vibes.",fafzx3
flwg51b,no movie has ever made me feel more alone or made me reminisce about being young and in love. an absolute masterpiece. everyone on earth has felt what these women felt at some point in their lives.,fafzx3
fuvjfmb,"In this film, every frame is a painting. Beautifully shot and acted, this is an exercise in restrain with dialogues and music sparingly but effectively used. The movies slow pace isn't for everyone but I believe that if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with a great commentary on patriarchy, love and passion. 

I remember there was a lot of discussion about female vs male gaze when this movie was released and I would agree this movie could not have been made by a man.The most obvious example being th sex scenes while not shying away from nudity are never explicit and the focus is always on the moments of intimacy rather than depicting sex graphically. Men are almost absent from the film. It's all about four women with both the leads Noemi Merlant and Adele Haenel having great chemistry and supported wonderfully by Luana Bajrami , her abortion story was heartbreaking and a well acted by her. The movie while commenting on forbidden love and patriarchy never becomes preachy or tries to conform to today's standards of feminism, it's real to the end.

Special mention to the  last 15-20 minutes which just  blew my breath away and took the movie to another level.

It's a near perfect film.

fmkuwsr,"Excellent film that lived up to expectations. The acting, the cinematography, the sheer emotion of it all, very little to complain about. And because it's a period piece, some things were endearingly weird. You need to be a French speaker to get this, but I chuckled at how Marianne and Heloise continued using the polite form ""vous"" for the entire film (even after fucking haha). Whereas Marianne started using ""tu"", the familiar form, with Sophie.",fafzx3
fjbvm7p,"I watched this film a week ago and I constantly find myself thinking about it: Marianne and Heloise's love story, Celine Sciamma's words, the visuals, that PHENOMENAL ending... I could go on and on. Sciamma introduced me (borrowing her eloquent words here) to a love story is based on equality, which is full of surprises and possibilities, and is also about emancipation. As a queer woman and fan of art, literature, and cinema, 'Portrait' is a life-changing experience for me in so many ways. I'll be holding onto this movie for life :')",fafzx3
fnijg7t,"This movie reminded me a lot of Call Me by Your Name. The intense slow build up to them falling in love was so well done. Absolutely heartbreaking ending as well, but atleast they always have their memories.",fafzx3
ftbf7ah,"This film has taken a permanent place in me - I cannot fathom how beautiful this is. When Héloïse stares away at the orchestra in the end (which is playing the same piece as Marianne does earlier on a harpsichord), the film took a major leap in the history of storytelling for me. 

Marianne turning back & becoming Orpheus, choosing the poet over the lover, Héloïse holding on to page no.28 years later on a portrait with her child, Sophie holding the infant's hand tightly as they abort her child, the portrait of Héloïse on fire in the classroom - I believe this film has given such incredible moments to the history of cinema altogether. 

One of the biggest winners for me was the screenplay which like the film's nature itself evolves slowly almost like a fire's rising flame. My experience of watching this got even better because I was watching this at 3am when it was pouring heavily outside my window (dramatic antithesis to experience, haha) 

Planning to watch all of the director's work for now (:",fafzx3
fj5vfzy,"Just finished watching, and I'm honestly speechless at the beauty of this film.  On the technical side, the cinematography was stunning.  There was hardly a scene that I wouldn't feel happy to print and have hanging on my wall.  Just amazing.

The story itself was beautifully constructed, I felt like the slower pace and limited dialogue added so much to the story.  I still have to take more time to fully process, but I was deeply moved by the portrayal of friendship, love, heartbreak.  Seeing the 28 in the portrait in the gallery definitely opened up the tears for me, and the final scene in the theater broke open the dam.  I think that Héloïse didn't see Marianne, but through the music, she felt Marianne still with her.  That definitely struck a deep cord, bringing back memories of people since gone from my life.  Huge props to Adèle and Noémie for those stunning performances as well.

Could be some recency bias, but I don't think I'm wrong in saying that this film is a true masterpiece and sits well within my top 5 favorites of all time. Easily my number 1 of 2019.  Seriously, go see this film.",fafzx3
fj0xw2u,"wow, really surprised with the polling 78% recommend in general, but 17%  ""Yes, but only for fans of the director/film/genre"".  I think this movie is amazing.

A lot of people would be turned off if they weren't into films like this.  idk, just my opinion.",fafzx3
flubljn,"Man this was one of those movies where after it's over I'm just in a weird funk, like I'm emotionally hungover. Most movies that I watch just end and I move on immediately, but I'm ""stuck"" on this one. Last one to hit me like this was Shoplifters.",fafzx3
fm4ssl7,"Me before watching: ""Urg it's going to be some typical french period love story about an artist falling for her subject and their forbiden and doomed romance."" 

Me after watching: ""It's a beautiful French period love story about an artist falling in love with her subject, their romance is doomed but it's all so beautiful and smart.""

I really loved this film there were so many troupes that I expected but instead of subverting expectations it stepped on the gas and ran right thru them with wit and beauty.",fafzx3
fmggdmp,"I’m not sure why this stuck out to me, but in one of the final scenes when Héloïse (in her wedding dress) is finally left in the darkness of the door shutting after Marianne had envisioned her so many times illuminating a shadowy doorway I was stunned. The artistry in the movie was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. “The lover’s choice” versus “the poet’s choice” in particular is such a beautiful concept and I am so grateful to have experienced this movie. Would’ve killed to see it in the theater.",fafzx3
fmjhrn1,"I don't know if I'll ever see another film like this in my lifetime.  I've seen a bunch of films but never quite something like this one, it's almost as if I got dumped. In a good way?

The reason I like this film so much is because of the completely pure romance between the two characters. It transcends gender, so it doesn't feel tied to any of that; it's just love in its purest form, made impossible by society and it's traditions. 

>!Not only that, but the way that the film had constantly been suggesting that we probably won't get the ending we hoped for but we still kept on hoping. Like Héloïse and Marianne cannot have their love, we cannot have the feel-good ending. I'm glad it ended like it did, or else it wouldn't fit the story and wouldn't have such a big impact on me.

There was so much silence in between the dialogue but the actresses were so amazing and with the cinematography you knew exactly what they were thinking. This movie is much slower than what I would normally like to watch but somehow I was just in a trance the whole movie and couldn't take my eyes off it. Usually I will look at my phone when watching a movie at home, for this movie I didn't look once.

fjzkhf0,"The intimacy of this movie is palpable. So many romance films just throw shit at the wall and hope people relate to what the actors are reading off the page. 


Seldom do the *artists*, which is what the actresses in this film are in the truest sense of the word, of a film create such a level of intimacy, such a burning passion between two individuals madly and fiercely in love and lust with one another to create a world so small, so delicate, so intimate. The strongest stars burn brightest and shortest. The truth of the passion in this story is painted across each frame of film reel, each glance between our two protagonists.  



Not to say much about the social commentary that is the true catalyst of this film. This is a classic romance, a classic commentary, a film *anyone* can slide into and remember something lost within their own lives, and how society hinders the expression of ourselves and our desires, our personal truths. 


The film was also ASMR dream-heaven. Sound was as much a player in this intimacy as the acting, the story, the environment created by the camera. Without the sound production, there is nothing. Pay attention and admire the craft, it deserves it.

The only kind of “issue” I had with it was with the maid character; I wish they either would’ve expanded more on that aspect or just left it out altogether as I felt it kinda distracted from what was going on with the two leads, but I definitely didn’t dislike the angle with the handmaiden just wish it could’ve been handled to the level the rest of the film was.

Wow. This was really beautiful. The cinematography, the music, the chemistry between the two leads. It's extremely sad but also makes you feel a lot of joy too. Makes you feel the same way you do when you're looking back at happy memories that can't be again. 

I actually genuinely love all the art in this movie too. The person who did all the portraits is extremely talented. 

I thought for sure this movie was based on a real event but it's an original screenplay. Just goes to show you how strong of a story it is. 

The director and two leads did a Q&A after and it turns out both actresses didn't really know each other at all prior to filming which is insane to me because their chemistry is so good. Their performances are the highlight of this film to me. 

It's definitely a little long, it was fairly predictable and maybe a tad dry at times. But I really loved this movie. The filmmaking is masterful, it captures the oppression of the time and what forbidden love feels like so well. The person behind me whispered 'wow' to themselves after the film finished so you know it's gotta be good.

I was thrown off at first by all the long shots on someone's face, but by the end I really appreciated how resonate it was with the themes and painting story in the movie.

The film was good not great for me until the final 15 minutes or so. What a whirlwind of emotions. There were audible gasps in the theater (including my own) for the brief shot of Heloise with the white dress, that was probably the most powerful shot of the movie for me. The next two ""endings"" really hit me like a ton of bricks, I was so invested in their relationship by that point. 8/10

I had a question for Reddit about how the Orpheus story relates to these two women. Marianne says she understand's Orpheus's decision as ""the poet's choice"" as opposed to the ""lover's choice"".

This will be the defining love story for many years to come.

Visually, this movie looks beautiful, the color palette is excellent with a stunning saturation of the primary colors. The cinematography is slow and delicate yet entrancing. This movie was shot in 7K, and this just adds to the sharp look of the movie. I've been going overboard with the adjectives, but I don't think words can describe how beautiful this movie looks. 

Just as good as the visuals is the acting by the two main actors: Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel. They deliver subtle yet powerful performances, selling their circumstances and journey into a relationship through body language, facial expression, and minimal dialogue

The relationship despite being at the forefront of the movie, never undercuts any of the other themes or sub-plots in the movie. In fact, the theme of sisterhood is beautifully conveyed. 

This movie is a masterpiece and I absolutely love this movie, and one I will continue to revisit. Its on HULU right now, so give it a watch.

So she got married to the Milanese man and got a portrait by another painter years later, while referencing page 28 for Marianne. Did she know this portrait was going to be seen by her, or was this just to show she never fully moved on?

And finally, what were they rubbing on their armpits to get high? Excuse my ignorance but I don’t think I’ve ever heard/seen this before.",fafzx3

flqokjs,"- This is one of the most strikingly beautiful visual movies in a long time. Sparse yet stunning, from the cliffs to the Chateau, it was all a joy to see and soak in.- It goes without saying that the performances were memorable. Adele Haenel especially was a tour de force. She has the simmering energy that is just bursting to come out, and when it does its mesmerizing. Merlant was great as well, the two had some truly eye opening chemistry.- The camera work in this movie was some of the most intimate I've ever seen. Close and personal but never gratuitous or excessive. The last half hour or so had some of the best framing and angles I think I've ever seen. It contributed big time to how memorable the picture was for me.- The image of Heloise on fire at the bonfire is one of the most visually arresting images in recent cinema history. The painting at the beginning was also quite striking, I was hoping we could have seen more of it!- The abortion scene and the contrasting life and death in the same frame was quite the balance. It reminded me for some reason of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Tree of Life.- The page 28 scene at the end...man...It simultaneously destroyed me and brought me great joy. And then that last scene, the music, her expression, the cut, my god. Just absolute perfection.",fafzx3

Saw this tonight and am absolutely stunned, shook, and blown away. What a beautiful beautiful film.

The two leads are stunning, and so lovely together. Funny when Heloise asks Marianne to guess when she first wanted to kiss her, because there were plenty of times before the first kiss where I thought to myself *oh man they're gonna kiss*.

fj5zgfi,"I watched this film for four times until now. Three times in movie theater. Every time I watched it I can obtain new feelings and understanding. It’s not just about love, not a portrait of a lady, but a portrait of women’s life and choice. They seems like no choice and be pressed by the patriarchy, but meanwhile they’re the heroes of their own lives. Even if the destiny cannot be escaped, they still chose to love. I could feel the strength of these women, that makes me feel that it’s not a tragedy. They lived.",fafzx3

I wish I knew more about the story of Orpheus and Eurydice prior to seeing it, but was still very much able to relate the ancient tale we're given with the one we're seeing unfold. ""She always walks in front of me."" 

Also, while it's pretty obvious that they're going to end up romantically involved, the scenes where their advances were slowly getting more overt were still so tense. Culminating in that final scene... My god was that breath taking.

Similar to Call Me by Your Name, the love between the two mains characters is so palpable and visceral you can't help but feel what they're feeling. The immense burning love they share, and the devastating heart brake. The symbolism and cinematography in this movie were phenomenal. Again, I compare to CMbYN,; not because they're both gay love movies, but because they're both amazing movies about love, especially forbidden love. Both movies are able to be tastefully erotic, real love, and sex is not like porn, both movies portray just how sexy passionate love making can be. Wonderfully crafted films, both of them.",fafzx3

Every year there's a select few films that strike me as all time classics in waiting, and I think this is one of them. The last year has been a year of superb cinema, but this is just the most breathtaking and beautiful of the bunch. It's small and intimate but made for the biggest screen and best speakers possible too. The performances and the script are immense. I couldn't possibly recommend a film more.",fafzx3
fj8ex4m,"2 things I've wondered about since seeing this film a couple months ago, might be obvious but just to clarify.

1. Throughout the film Marianne seems to see a vision of Heloise in her wedding dress. I think it happens maybe 3 times. Does this just represent how Heloise getting married soon looms over Marianne? Even though she is in love with her, are these the moments where she briefly remembers that it won't last forever and one day Heloise won't be hers anymore, but stuck with someone else? So the image/idea basically haunts her? Heloise and the atmosphere of those scenes make it seem so ghostly, I just wonder if I had missed its deeper meaning.
2. At the end when Marianne sees Heloise a the orchestra, Heloise is crying and unraveling, but she never turns to look back at her. At first I just thought it was because Heloise didn't know she was there, but then I remembered when they bring up the story where the man refuses to look at the woman he loves/loved because he'd rather live on with the memories they shared or the thought of her (something like that) rather than see her again and reignite those old feelings and cherishing her in his memory. I'm butchering what story they talk about, as it's been a while, but is that why she is crying/not looking at her, rather than just being upset with her current life? Or is the orchestra the only place loud/private enough that it's the only time Heloise can let out her emotions?",fafzx3

fj3252c,"I made a post over in /r/DoubleFeatures that pairs this with High Art (1998).

The audience were giggling at some of the line deliveries and long stares between them.

It’s not badly shot or acted, but I found the story so disinteresting that the ending didn’t do anything for me at all. In fact, some audiences found it hilarious.

fkjmlz1,"I found this film to be very disappointing.

Disappointing with how conventional it ended up being. Disappointing with how unoriginal it was in its plotting. Disappointing with how literal it was in its interpretation of ""lady on fire"". And disappointing with how it veered away from its potentially intriguing setup of a painter disguised as a walking partner and went full bore into sappy romantic gay cliches of how these two were exploring a forbidden love. Not like we haven't seen this before, and done better.

There were also a lot of critiques about society that were shoehorned into the plotting of this movie. Themes about abortions, involuntary pregnancies, rape, and suicide were touched on, but failed to percolate and provide structure to the thesis.

The symbolism and metaphors the film uses to attempt to elevate these themes into grandiose talking points end up falling way short due to how mixed their messages are. For example, the impromptu painting of Heloise reaching up another Sophie's skirt as she lay on her back isn't clear about its intention (is it a reference about induced abortions, or is it a reference about forbidden lovers experimenting with gay sex?). Another example is the pendant with which Marianne has a picture of Heloise; she says it's a token to remember the Heloise by, but that viewpoint is cancelled out when Marianne specifically says she only saw her long lost love two other times in her life......well, wouldn't she technically see her everytime she looks at her pendant......meaning the significance of the pendant becomes moot. Then there was the apparition of Heloise coming into view dressed in white gowning. Is this meant to signify Heloises purity and inability of Marianne to see her as within her league, or is it meant to foreshadow the inevitable marriage she is meant to have with a man she does not love?

The movie also fails to make it clear whether these women were bisexual or strictly gay, which in my opinion is crucial to interest of the love story.

I must admit the scenery was breathtaking and the suspense was inviting (like wondering if Heloise will wake up before Marianne finishes drawing her).

For me, the drama was desultory and uncompelling.",fafzx3

flunkom,"I saw this a little back (before the quarantining) in a theater and while it was gorgeous, I really was disappointed. Maybe it was a case of really high expectations, but I just didn't connect. I thought it was slow-paced but, perhaps more importantly, it felt like a slow pace which I didn't think suited the plot at all. I found it hard to buy into the central relationship with the slow-paced start and I feel like the melodramatic plot isn't really anything new. Idk, just wasn't for me, I couldn't stop thinking about CMBYN and how I'd rather have been watching that. Or The Handmaiden. But I'd rather be watching The Handmaiden than doing literally anything else.",fafzx3
fj039p2,"Well I was not impressed.

It's a nice period drama with beautiful costumes, light, scenery, hair and makeup. I liked it more than the new Little Women. I didn't find it slow or anything. I thought the pacing was swift and I didn't get bored.

However, it's just so predictable. This is a straightforward star crossed lovers where you expect them to share a couple nights of passion and then go their separate ways because one has to marry. I felt like I've seen that story before. Especially that ending of only having the memory and feeling sad, it felt very already done. I wasn't blown away by the line delivery either. A lot of the emotion felt forced. They've only known each other for a few days so how can they be talking about love? It's just a hookup, it's not as deep as they are trying to make it. I might have bought it if they knew each other longer. I think they cast the perfect actresses, it's just the script didn't ring authentic to me. I saw it in French and I speak French, in case that changes anything.

I did like the page 28 and the final scene watching the orchestral version of the song she played, and I liked the character of the painter who had a singular life.",fafzx3

I am a **huge** fan of slow-burners. I've seen these forbidden love movies before and this didn't really bring anything new to the table.

It was interesting it went with no score, too. It did have some really nice shots but I wouldn't say it had anything incredible in terms of cinematography. The editing was pretty non-existent as most shots just sat in frame for the duration of the scenes; nothing groundbreaking from a technical aspect.

fm75e1r,"Everybody discussing ending is portrayed in the film. As Heloize, Marianne, and Sophie discussing the end of Orpheus and Euripides myth.

I'm of Sophie's stance. 

Marianne could have waited for Heloize outside of theater if she wanted to meet her. 

It's an effective but cheap choice from the director to end their story as fatalistic as a Greek myth.

The director already sinned by arranging a love story that was doomed to last one week and be ended by an arranged marriage. So cliche. But ok, quite realistic for those times. 

On the other hand, they not at least meeting or being in contact after Heolize's marriage isn't as well motivated.

Even in the story which was the inspiration for the film, ended romance between Celine and Adele they keep contact. 

But I guess that's the director's vision of the film. Her interpretation of the real story, not the story itself. 

Same as her interpretation of Orpheus and Euripides' departure, as a choice. And not doom. 
Which I also don't like.

The more I am critical toward the director, the more I see myself, again portrayed in the movie, in the scene where Heloize critiques Marianne's painting.

Your interpretation of the scene is much better than mines, because I thought it was symbolizing Heloise's desire to be happy yet her depression from her sister's suicide, her controlling mother, and her unwanted arranged marriage is what was holding her back and that Marianne was starting to fall Heloise but quickly realized that Heloise's issues were going to prevent them from having any real future together.

Edit: More to add about [the final scene](https://youtu.be/TaaH09v3GKk) from Cèline and Adèle! [This video starts at 18:09](https://youtu.be/ovDDyQBzeag?t=1089)  where someone in the audience asks about it. Cèline's explanation is so interesting: she simply gave Adèle steps of emotions to follow in sequence, but no timing for each one. Adèle improvised the rhythm for this scene. The prompts were:

*she remembers*  
*she thinks about lost love*  
*she listens to the music and enjoys it*  
*she's sad*

I think in the same way that Heloise, Sophie, and Marianne take apart the lover's choice vs. the poet's choice, this is Sciamma's debate of the artist's choice vs. the realist's choice. 

The artist's choice, as most romantic movies make, would be to cut away at the end of the love affair. It's still tragic, but in a contained way. It doesn't spill over into the after. It lets the viewer hold the the affair in their minds untouched and clean. 

Sciamma seemed to want to avoid every single ""standard"" romance movie decision in the interest of giving us fully fleshed-out women. I think by showing the ""after"" of that scene, it holds the viewer's head and forces us to look at the reality following the decisions of Heloise and Marianne. However it's not necessarily messy and gritty and dark the way that media that make the realist's choice often is (Brokeback Mountain does this I'd argue). In the way that women have pretty much always done, they get up and carry on existing in the wider world. There's no dramatic, slow spiral. Yet it's just as tragic because it's allows us to see how the details of the lives of the Mariannes and Heloises, these great love affairs, were lost to the invisibility created by womanhood.

She manages to make the realist's choice and the artist's choice while portraying women, something film rarely manages to do. It was brilliant.",fafzx3

hw00i0b,"I think the answer to that is in their penultimate dialogue, ""I thought you were braver than this"", although there were hints all throughout the film with the story of Orpheus. 

It takes a lot of guts to love somebody that strongly, while knowing it will all inevitably end. True love requires infinite courage in the face of destiny.

Their love is a rare kind, thoroughly deep and genuine. Having it any other way would have spoiled it, and ending it in its ideal state was what they chose. So that the memory of something that pure could live on. Instead of degrading into a sordid and frustrating affair, as they would be forced to live in fear for the rest of their lives.

Just as Orpheus - perhaps poetically, or perhaps in cowardice - chose not to bring his wife from the dead.

I realize I'm replying to a very old comment here, but just wanted to record my own thoughts on this as I was struck by the same question.",fafzx3
g2csy8a,"I'm also still trying to wrap my head around the deeper meaning in this scene, and don't think I fully understand it yet, but this was my take after a few re-watches:

Marianne wants to destroy the painting as to prevent Heloise's impending marriage. Her statement comes with  assumptions that Heloise won't resist the marriage, and that Heloise lacks agency. She describes it as giving Heloise away to another, like a material possession. 

Heloise says that's terrible, and accuses Marianne of holding a grudge against Heloise, blaming her for her impending marriage. This is the part I'm still unclear about, but I think she describes it as ""holding a grudge"" because Marianne sees destruction of the painting as the only valid way out of the situation.

The painting is something they both collaborated over; people may commonly think that a painter does all the work with portraits, but as we see in the first half of the movie, collaboration from the subject/paintee is also crucial in order to produce good art. Not only is their painting a product of both of their efforts, it also captures the memories of their love in that short period of time. 

So, for Marianne to so easily say that she would willingly destroy something Heloise adores in order to stop the marriage probably seems like Heloise is being penalized for something that she never wanted to do in the first place (her promise of marriage to someone she knows nothing about probably feels like punishment enough). And instead of asking Heloise to not go through with it, or possibly suggesting running away together, the fact that Marianne sees destruction of the painting as a solution probably implied to Heloise that Marianne doesn't think she will resist the marriage at all. In that moment, Heloise is reduced to a female object that'll be sold off to be married. 

This really hurts Heloise. She's not only dealing with her sister's death and the loss of her freedom, but also being treated like marriage currency by her mother (and implicitly, the society) when she so easily replaces her sister's place in the arranged marriage. She probably thought Marianne would be the one person who wouldn't treat her as such. Marianne then says that it's a way to stop herself from hoping for a different outcome. Marianne is trying to cope with the pain of their impending separation by telling herself that Heloise wants this and that she'll be happy. Heloise lets it be known that she doesn't want any of this, and that she isn't complicit in any way. 

Heloise asks if Marianne would prefer that she resisted. Marianne says yes. Heloise then asks if Marianne is going to ask her to resist. Marianne says no. This exchange is a continuation of them both accusing each other of being cowardly (""I thought you were braver""). While neither want the relationship to end, and have both obviously spent time thinking about how to get out of the marriage, neither can actually go through with it due to fear of the backlash. The background of the movie becomes really important here to understand the context of their fear.

There are scenes peppered throughout the movie that don't add to the main plot, but help establish the tone of daily life of women in France in the late 1700s: Marianne not being able to paint male nude models, Heloise going to a convent to gain freedom away from family/societal expectations, abortion being illegal (and most likely punishable by death at this time, historians of Reddit, help), Heloise's sister choosing death over losing her agency through a contract marriage. Being a woman is already dicey enough as it is; being a woman in a romantic relationship with another woman becomes exponentially dangerous. Women do not have the means to be independent regardless of riches and/or status as society doesn't allow that. 

They can try to run away from reality to continue on with their love, but there is very little guarantee of their safety, which also means that their love might not be continued in the same shape/form it has so far. They're not necessarily being cowardly, but realistic. They've both decided that keeping this beautiful memory of love and continuing on with their lives is the better choice, compared to trying to live out the rest of their love with tremendous risk.

They both know this, but Marianne is almost acting out childishly in this scene, letting Heloise know that she's unhappy with the situation, while making no effort to change the course of their trajectory. But in the scene after, Marianne apologizes for having acted out, and lets Heloise know that her mom returns the next day which basically means they now need to make the most out of the little time they have left.

I'm really curious to know how others interpreted the scene. I don't speak French so I may have missed some key connotation in their speech as well (I'm solely relying on the English captions)",fafzx3

Marianne says Orpheus's choice to look back was that of the poet, not the romantic––choosing the memory over the real thing.

I think this ties into your second question also. She could be holding the page \^28\^ for both reasons. One, as a long shot that she may one day see it, and two, the difficulty she may experience in letting it go, especially when all forces in her life direct her away from Marianne.

fj9prqr,"The song Heloise listens to at the end is the song Marianne played for her on the harpsichord early on in the film. The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice happens opposite to how you remember it - Orpheus specifically does look back, going against the deal he made with Hades to get his lover out of the underworld because he couldn't bear not seeing Eurydice any longer. Normally people put this down to the doubt he feels, as on the journey he cannot hear or turn back to see Eurydice so he doesn't know if she is following him out of the underworld, or they just put it down to him being impatient to see his lover. Heloise, however, suggests when they are reading the story that perhaps Eurydice told him to turn around giving him permission to make the 'poet's choice' to always hold onto his memory of Eurydice with one last look rather than the lover's choice to stay together forever. This is reflected in Marianne and Heloise's last moments together at the mansion when Heloise tells Marianne to turn around just as she is about to leave forever and Marianne sees her in Heloise in her wedding dress on the stairs before leaving forever.  

There are a couple interpretations therefore about Heloise's reaction at the symohony at the end. Either she didn't know that Marianne was there and was simply reacting to the music which Marianne had played for her (perhaps this is her first time hearing it properly and it brings back all her feelings about their relationship or maybe she listens frequently and this is how she always responds) or Heloise does know that Marianne is there but makes the so-called 'lover's choice' to not turn around. I personally prefer the former as I'm not sure what Heloise deciding not to acknowledge Marianne really says about their relationship.  

Maybe as you say she is in fact making the poet's choice by choosing only to remember Marianne. This is confusing though because choosing not to turn around is the opposite of what Orpheus does in the story but they both result in the 'poet's choice' but obviously the situation is different so perhaps that's explanation enough for this. Though this being confusing is why I'm inclined to think she does not know Marianne is there.

flng6zq,"I disagree, but I freely admit that this movie is not for everyone.

SPOILERS:
  
The ""abortion"" reenactment was her giving her a moment to paint that men are not privy to.  

Her in the wedding gown was a flash of her in the ""abyss"" of an arranged marriage.  

The movie has a large message of the ""female viewpoint"", and wants to use that as its lens.

Also, there is a lot of real life thrown into this movie.  The actress who plays Heloise was sexually harassed by a former director.  Also the actress who plays Heloise had a relationship with this director previously.  So in a way, it is part their story.  Director/Actress played out as Painter/Subject.  

I personally don't think it matters if they were bisexual or gay.  Heloise came from a convent, Marianne gave her a taste of music, possibilities, then of love.  

They found love, but Heloise asked her to look back once more and then she fell into her abyss.

To me the movie is about a first love that is lost... and the longing that goes with it.  

I found the singing around the fire a bit odd, and the abortion scene  a little political (although there were realities then), I really didn't see any point of the ""drug"" scene.  

However, the ""looks"" between them, and the smart ""chess like"" dialogue was wonderful.  I could feel their desire, and cared for them very much, which makes me overlook those issues.  Not to mention how beautifully shot this movies was.",fafzx3
fme3k0q,"I’m late to the party, and despite loving it, I can see where you’re coming from. 

I think perhaps part of the reason it clicked for me was that many of the things you pointed out are, in my mind, pieces of a much larger puzzle, each working together to further the narrative. That is, each fragmented theme you mentioned can be linked by what I believe the film is truly about: the female experience. Abortions, involuntary pregnancies, rape, discrimination, these were all things experienced by and dealt with solely by women. If the film doesn’t dedicate significant time to one of these elements, that is only because it takes it in stride, as women of that time would have.

Marianne is forbidden to paint the male figure, so she paints the abortion scene. She paints what is known only to women, that will be seen only by women. There is something powerful about that. 

The pendant is a token of their love, but Heloise acknowledges that the image will only remind Marianne of Heloise. The concept that a painting only has true life and warmth when there is a certain level of understanding between the subject and artist is established, but it’s made clear that a painting can only be a weak substitute for a person. Thus the pendant is both significant, yet inadequate. 

The visions Marianne has of Heloise in the dress to me symbolize the knowledge that their time together is short, that Heloise will wear a wedding dress as she steps into the abyss, and away from Marianne. It haunts her. 

Finally, while Heloise’s sexuality is uncertain, I think Marianne’s is known. When Heloise says “you cannot understand me because you have a choice” Marianne responds “I understand you”, or something to that effect. In my eyes, Marianne is admitting that she cannot, and will not marry, as she cannot marry whom she wishes, suggesting that she is gay.

fj1kdw1,">  It's just a hookup, it's not as deep as they are trying to make it. I might have bought it if they knew each other longer

You're not wrong, and the story certainly isn't brand new, but I think everything hinged on the fact that they were in a helpless situation. Heloise was ripped from her life where she was relatively happy (in a convent, which itself is an unfortunate situation as it is) in order to go marry a guy that was supposed to marry her sister. Her sister who was so opposed to the idea she killed herself.

The romance itself was a fling, yes, but it was also the first love Heloise has ever known in her life, and the last taste of freedom she will have before she is married to someone she doesn't know. My main takeaway form the film wasn't just 'oh man what a tragic story', it was 'wow look at the kind of shit women had to deal with 260 years ago.'",fafzx3

I’m also not a huge fan of heavy handed foreshadowing in films like they did with the Orpheus story, but I’m probably one of the few there. It takes me out of the story all the time when films present some other piece of literature/cinema early in the film that’s very clearly there to mirror what happens later.

fj2enz1,"Is the ""love"" talk really that unrealistic, especially for the era?  I feel like people in those times would write love poetry just based on the site of a pretty maiden at the market. Plus if it was a ""hookup,"" then propriety would dictate that the hookup be for life, since you're only supposed to have one monogomous lover. Add in her impending marriage, and I could believe they fell for each other quickly.

I don't disagree that elements were forced or predictable. For me, I thought that having abortive medicinal herbs, an abortion, a witchy bonfire, the birth and death of a full relationship, paintings, psychadelic drugs... all within a 5 day parental absence seemed like a stretch. Also, an almost utopian wish fulfillment of modern day feminism. I didn't *totally* buy it.

Still, I bought it well enough, and I quite liked the movie. Tense, hot, amazing end, interesting setting.

fiznogx,"At first I thought so too, but now I think the recreation of the abortion scene serves as a moment of character growth for Marianne.

The idea is very fuzzy in my head, but I feel like Heloise choosing to not look is to keep her love for Marianne alive and raw (the lover's choice), not as a memory (the poet's choice.)

It showed that Heloise wasn't simply an artists muse but a woman with her own ideas and views which made Marianne love her more. It also brought up the idea that the story wasn't just about Orpheus (a man) going to fetch his lover and then deciding to leave her. But as Heloise suggests, it could've been about Eurydice (a woman) taking control of the situation and deciding she didn't want to go back to the world with Orpheus thus asking him to 'turn around' and let her go. Of course it also foreshadows the sad ending of the movie but perhaps lets us know that the women were in control and made the difficult decision to part.",fafzx3

I took it, certainly for Heloise, as being in love with true, brief freedom, and Marianne was very much a part of her feeling her true self. She was the gift of freedom, feeling, laughter, music, everything really.

She has the same accent as Marianne.

frfn5sp,Interesting. Comments like these are making me rethink my appreciation for this film and I’m now really doubting my admiration for the movie... perspective is fascinating thing,fafzx3
frptsfy,Pariah,fafzx3
fjfei5t,I saw it for the third time and tried to focus on the cuts. There are some insanely elegant transitions in this movie.,fafzx3
fj1prkq,"French criticism has entirely reverted to the ""tradition of quality"" that the New Wave fought so hard against. It infuriates me. And yesterday Cahiers du Cinema died.",fafzx3
fj0onrk,"Gotcha. I don’t have any first hand knowledge, just got that from listening to an interview with the director. Thought it was interesting.",fafzx3
fizif03,its very rare for foreign films to get nominated for anything but best pic and best foreign so it wouldnt really matter anyways. it got a ton of noms at the caesars so its fine,fafzx3
fizpuy2,"Its not like winning foreign film is that important, the one that gets nominated for best picture will still be more looked back on. Like last year Roma shouldn’t have been in best foreign film and maybe Cold War should’ve won.",fafzx3

fnzdnk9,Haha I freaked out for a sec,fafzx3
fupd0lf,"No - it's no longer eligible. NEON tried to gun for last year's awards season with a limited release sometime in December, in LA, and France picked Les Mis over POALOF for their Foreign Picture representative so... it's just going to be one of those movies that could have and should have been an Oscar contender and just... didn't end up getting any recognition at all, beyond the Cannes Best Screenplay award and Cesar Best Cinematography award.",fafzx3
fsbi8zt,I hope we see a nomination. Deserves it.,fafzx3
fvjcdig,"Fair enough, I feel like pinning movies down to who the romance is between can get a bit reductive though",fafzx3
fj4u8lb,"Some people do, including you and I. Doesn't change the fact that Parasite would have won (and did).",fafzx3
hirkh6t,Can't really have a civil discussion if you consider a contrary opinion to yours an insult.,fafzx3
i3v7jh2,I find the characters are extremely rich. They look at four very different women throughout the film and their feelings and actions towards liberty and expectations,fafzx3
hire455,"From ""thrown around"" i deduce that the argument is common, i have read a lot of threads and reviews about this movie and I have never seen someone call it suspenseful. If it were labeled as a suspense movie, thats another story, but just because you saw a pretty bad opinion or two out of the thousands there are of this movie, that doesn't mean you have to generalise and think that everyone has that opinion.",fafzx3
hirmzg2,Define boring (it didn't keep you on the edge of your seat?),fafzx3
fk0j4r7,Was it not reviewed well there? It  received 9 nominations at the Cesars . Won best Screenplay at Cannes,fafzx3

fltn8ws,"Interestingly, the only three times that music plays in the entire movie are: 1) When Marianne plays the harpsichord for Héloïse; 2) During the bonfire scene; and 3) The Vivaldi piece playing in the final scene. 

I think it's interesting how little sound or music there is in this film, yet it all still felt so musical and rhythmic. The quietude definitely contributed to the intensity of every glance, and of course, made the bonfire scene explosively impactful.",fafzx3
fm13han,The sound editing was insane,fafzx3
fj1duiy,"I would agree that that scene is a bit too heavy handed. However, I think what rescues it from being just plain bad is the inclusion of the servant in that scenario. That, too, comes off as perhaps too convenient, but I liked the way Sciamma used the scene to show both her nonchalant integration among the two higher status girls and her distance from them at the same time, with her more “down to earth”, though valid, take on the myth.",fafzx3
fj1d6xr,"While it is expository, I don't know of a better way to set up the rest of the movie. It's like that moment that felt a bit clunky at the time paid off so much at the end. When reading the story; one said to look and one said not to. When at the orchestra; one looked and one didn't. It needs to be done in that way for it to be so clear and powerful in that final scene.",fafzx3
fj19e2e,I feel like Celiné probably tried to find another way to fit that in there but there was no other possible way given the time period the movie is set in,fafzx3
fjnonw8,"I think Marianne knew it was always a fling, otherwise she would have finagled a way to get to Milan (her discussing the city with her mother seemed to build that up) but she knew that could have been too risky for the both of them to be her concubine/consort/whatever. Over the course of the film though, I think she was falling for her more and more, though like you said it might have just been a steady realization that she's losing control. That image of Heloise in her gown seemed to haunt her, and what at first seemed like a reminder of 'this is temporary' eventually seemed like a warning of 'you're going to lose her'.

I do think Heloise was in love though, and that page 28 note on her portrait seemed to confirm that. If Marianne kept the notion that it was always just a fling, seeing that portrait seemed to break that notion.",fafzx3
fjfdn7d,"The abortion plot adds so much to the movie's discussion about women's lives, the personal impacts of their sexual lives, what women experience in the absence of men, and especially what we record and depict in art - why are things like abortion, a common experience, not considered the ""great subjects"" like the ones that escape Marianne's reach as a woman artist? The three create their own meaning and value in choosing to reconstruct and remember, via art, an experience they and many other women go through.",fafzx3
fiztswx,"I saw it as more of a showcase of what women went through/are still going through in some parts of the world. Telling her to ""look"" is effectively telling us as the audience to look at it and not shy away from a harsh reality and troued topic such as abortion.",fafzx3
fiznar4,"Even though that scene was uncomfortable and good, I agree, sophie's storyline was unnecessary",fafzx3
fj6cdlf,"Omg, Burning is phenomenal. Better than Parasite IMHO though the handful of people I know who’ve seen both disagree. FWIW I really enjoyed not knowing *anything* about the plot going into Burning.",fafzx3
fj0lnl0,Huh? Parasite wasn't constant action,fafzx3
fj1ifj9,"The only two bits of music are when Marianne plays the song on the piano, which is the first moment she really connects with Heloise, and in the final scene when the orchestra plays that same song. The moment where Heloise thinks back on her memory of Marianne playing that very song to her and she breaks down. If there was other songs played throughout the movie; one, some people might not put together that it's the exact same song as before, and two, because it would diminish the intensity of the moments when music *does* play.",fafzx3
fj6nrk8,"Not trying to be nitpicky but given that Heloise was raised at a convent, it's hard to believe she wasn't exposed to any music. Certainly she would have heard many hymns in her life, just not orchestras or probably anything not religious.",fafzx3
fjkz67n,"Parasite says ""how are you doing?"" while it carries a box full of awards.",fafzx3

fjnaa2q,"Oh man, don't even get me starred in everything this film does with color.",fafzx3
frpqzoz,"My thoughts exactly! She went through the motions as the orchestra played. First nostalgia, then sadness, then you could see her smile through the tears as she remembered one of the fond moments they shared. Amazing scene.",fafzx3
fj2n8hd,"I definitely will! (even if the ending is going to destroy me every time) I can't wait to get my hands on a bluray copy, this film deserves that.",fafzx3
fj1tt2g,Not sure if I would agree. And Cahiers actually panned Portrait of a Lady on Fire.,fafzx3
fj0rql3,Winning foreign film is important when historically that was the only damn thing any non-English movie could win at the Oscars...? It's great that Parasite won but I would bet good money there won't be another foreign film winning BP this decade,fafzx3
fm19dl1,That was....so hot,fafzx3
fj085tt,The scene where Marianne sketches herself in the book and a naked Heloise has a mirror on her crotch for Marianne to see herself.,fafzx3

fj0k4w4,"You’re definitely making me interested, as soon as I can I’ll embark on a serious Sciamma marathon and I’ll be sure to keep an eye out for her way of handling this aspect of her stories. Thanks again!",fafzx3
fnbozc4,Yes and agreed to all of the above. I have never felt feelings this intense for a goddamn movie. Fun fact a friend and I actually wrote a whole essay about it after we watched it as a mental outlet and it wasn't even for school or anything. I've never done something like that.,fafzx3
fuphrnv,Thank you so much for the information you have shared here.,fafzx3
fsbnpfm,"Yes, we should wait until next year..",fafzx3
fvjcm76,"mmm

To me Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Call Me By Your Name serve the same itch, the love that will never be in an idyllic setting. I haven't watched every LGBT or even straight romance movie out there, but I'm catching up. I'm not a professional critic (except perhaps when books are involved) so I apologize to anyone if I appeared to be pigeonholing the movies into the LGBT category 

The chemistry between the two just hit wild for me",fafzx3

flve4wa,"The 3 times music plays are also some really pivotal moments. 

The first time (harpsichord) - Heloise is looking at Marianne more than the latter is looking at her. This is Heloise's chance to observe Marianne, and I wouldn't be surprised if *this* was the moment Heloise first wanted to kiss Marianne.

The second time (bonfire) - they're both looking at each other, and they both realize they share their desire for each other (or Heloise 'gives in' to it?) and SMASH CUT! to that beach scene. 

The third time (concert) - Marianne is watching Heloise. Does Heloise know she's there? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, Heloise remembers.",fafzx3

fj1ipay,"I picked up on the piano and orchestral piece but that's good analysis on why score was left out of the remainder of the film. Thanks.

During where in the film was this scene?",fafzx3
fj1yac4,"Yeah I've been told that the almost all critics in France disliked the film. Which is evidence for my original point in itself.

fj0sptw,">What is more remembered, the foreign film winner or the only foreign best picture nominee of that year?

Honestly? The foreign film winner, but this is coming from someone who closely follows awards season every year. I understand your point but it's really not a viable solution when the Oscars is supposed to be (and I use this term loosely) a meritocracy. 

Also, the foreign film award is technically given to the country of origin, not to any one person involved in the making of the movie itself so you'd be robbing the country of the prestige of having an Oscar simply because of a technicality in the way the awards work",fafzx3
