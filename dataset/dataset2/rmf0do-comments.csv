hqdj49s,"I legitimately just left a sold out showing of this where everyone clapped at the end. Blew my mind. It was good fun but there’s no way the kids in the theater knew half of those songs.

Solid 7/10 movie. Enjoyed it way more than I expected. Chop Suey moment caught me off guard and I couldn’t stop laughing. Bono was great. The cast was honestly incredible for this one, although I kept thinking Halsey was Margot Robbie.

Animation was some of the best I’ve ever seen. The show looked absolutely incredible and was actually really entertaining. There were a lot of emotional moments I wasn’t expecting that hit hard, like the anxiety issues and Rosita being so down by losing her part. Definitely not just a kids movie.",rmf0do

hpph4r4,"IDK I really enjoyed the first one but this one felt a little underwhelming. :/ The storylines weren’t as strong.

hqia4ld,"Some of the highlights of Sing 2:

* Buster Moon and his performers have become more than just a small group of people who share a love of musical theater. They're their own little clan now, and it's pretty wholesome.
* I really liked Nooshy: that girl had plenty of spunk and talent, and her supportive friendship with Johnny was cute.
* Ash spent a lot of time bonding with furry Bono, coaxing him out of his shell, and their subplot was probably the most touching one of the bunch,
* Meena's precocious crush on furry Pharrell Williams helped her deal with a diva.
* Johnny proved himself as a performer, and triumphed over his incredibly unprofessional dance instructor.
* Johnny's gang connections actually came in handy for once when the theater animals needed some eleventh hour back-up.
* Jimmy Crystal was nine different flavors of crazy, and totally game to commit some murder anytime, anywhere. Jimmy and his assistant Jerry were also basically the Gaston and Lefou of this movie.
* Buster Moon bit off way more than he could chew in this movie and came dangerously close to meeting the Grim Reaper, before Rosita (pig mom extraordinaire) swooped in for the save.
* Taron Egerton and Tori Kelly's cover of ""There's Nothing Holding Me Back"" slaps more than it has any right to, with Tori in particular killing those high notes.",rmf0do

hqpnp98,"I liked the film. The first Sing has a special place in my heart for whatever reason, just tickled me in a way, and Sing 2 was much the same with a few exceptions. I really liked the story around the lion, but I wish they'd focused on that storyline more. I think the story was really powerful but it's literally told across like...3 scenes. I wish they'd cut some other stuff out to more fully explore that story, and I would have liked to see a little more interaction between him and Ash to establish how she got him to overcome his grief and such. I think the elephant's subplot was unnecessary, and the murderous wolf guy was kind of an insane thing to add, I think if both these things had been reduced and the story focused more on the lion it would have been a bit stronger.

That being said, the gorilla's subplot was good and his song was incredibly well done! That cover was nuts. I liked Portia's storyline too. I kind of adored that Ash went from an arc of healing in the first movie to the arc of helping someone else heal in the second movie, I think that was a good progression for her character. Koala was kind of annoying, but I actually kind of appreciate an unlikeable protagonist every now and then, it's especially interesting to see that in a kid's movie. Overall I think this movie and the first Sing are probably some of the best work Illumination has put out since the first Despicable Me, which isn't saying much, but they're both solid kids movies that try to do a little more than ""fart joke haha"" which I really appreciate.",rmf0do

hplsl40,"I was expecting to enjoy this and I thoroughly did. I was surprised how much I liked the first Sing when I finally got around to seeing it. It may be predictable or cheesy, but I find the cast of characters to be endearing and the music ranges from fine to pretty great. The core is really just several characters overcoming their fears and insecurities, and that's still the focus. Is it weird that the main conflict of the movie is that someone wants to murder a koala? Actually, yeah that was a bit darker than everything else. 

Look, it's an animated jukebox musical for kids. It doesn't have to be high art. But this movie I found to look and sound just great. Great voice acting, solid music choices, dope set pieces, and some moments that can really hit home if you let it. I liked how a lot of the characters were still dealing with similar issues in a different context. Gorilla boy got the approval of his father, but he still craves it from his dancing instructor. Meena has the confidence to sing on stage now, but still not enough to do a romantic scene. The dreamer behind it all is still dreaming too big and obsessively determined to see it come to fruition. 

One thing I was really into were the visuals. Not only was the stage show beautiful, but I feel like they went out of their way to not use the freedom of animation as a reason to make the stage effects unrealistic. They were bombastic and big, but they would let us see the strings or how thr stage moved. I'm not sure a show like this would be practical to put on IRL, but as a fan of the stage I was able to believe that you could pull this off if you had access to 500 six inch tall tap dancing janitors and just be wowed by it. 

Overall, I'm not sure anything in this movie reaches the highs of the I'm Still Standing or Set It All Free from the first movie, but the great animation and humor and endearing characters are back for more. I was into it. 7/10.

hpn6jl6,"Gunter is my favorite animated character since Rex in the Toy Story series. 

In fact, these movies remind me of the Toy Story series and how loveable all of the side characters are in both.I know that’s gonna be an unpopular opinion, but the movies have a lot of heart to them. Buster is like a parallel to Woody in a lot of ways.",rmf0do
hq3jpb8,"A white arctic wolf lay on the floor, battered and weeping.

His bones ached from the beating he had just taken and his sobs were muffled to not attract more attention. His vision slowly came back into focus through blurry eyes and he spotted through the window that somehow, it was snowing, yet there were no clouds and the moon was out and the stars dotted the sky.

James Crystal was an unwanted birth and his father quickly left the mother and child on their own. Word would come back that the father had drowned in frigid waters after a drunken accident where he slipped onto an icy river.

His mother remarried to a surly Alaskan wolf. While this wolf treated his mother very kindly, he took physicality to his stepson under the guise of discipline. Because the mother was taken care of and did not face hardships, she looked the other way as her son was viciously beaten on a near daily basis.

***

“James,” the teacher said. “I want you to reflect on what you did. I know you are not a bad child. I know you did what you think you had to do to earn respect. But I want you to find a better way.”

James had injured and drawn blood from a group of classmates that included a large bully in the form of a yak, and his accomplices consisting of an eagle and an undersized polar bear. As per usual, the one that reacts was the one that got caught and James was now serving an in-school suspension.

The teacher was a middle aged lady who was once obviously pretty but now a slightly overweight snow bunny. She sighed and turned on the radio.

A guitar riff that was pleasing to the ears caught James’ attention. But soon it was the lyrics that would captivate him.

A smooth croon came alive. 

“I want to run.”

“I want to hide.”

“I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside.”

The teacher noticed that her pupil’s eyes and ears were uncharacteristically engaged.

“Are you a fan of Clay?” the teacher asked.

“Who?” James grumbled.

The teacher raised her eyebrow. “Clay Calloway. He’s the one singing this song.” 

James feigned a yawn and put his head in his paws to pretend to sleep. But he could not help but to commit the name to memory as the song continued.

“I wanna take shelter from the poison rain.”

“Where the streets have no name.”",rmf0do

hqvv6sz,"I loved it. And, as a fan of U2, I loved loved LOVED Bono's character. However, something makes me wonder if someone like Sting would have been a better choice.

Whatever, still the best movie Bono has been in since Rattle & Hum.",rmf0do
hpmemrc,"Sitting in the theater now as the credits roll. Some thoughts:

The koala character is still really unlikable. Like last film most of the conflict comes from him lying to people to get ahead. This time he lies about knowing a celebrity who hasn't been seen in 15 years. At least this time I feel like he has more consequences for his actions but I still root against him.

Gorilla had the best subplot mostly because his ending song was really good. Elephant girl was mostly forgettable where's Reese Witherspoon pig was sweet. I do like that she has a husband and isn't just paired with annoying fat pig.

The visuals were better, the songs were great but it's all licensed music. Bono as Lion was pretty sweet. I don't know any of the characters names. 3/10 it's illumination but the songs were fun and I enjoyed myself I guess. Better than the first one but only because Koala almost dies like twice.",rmf0do
hq3xrz4,Not sure if it was mentioned but is there a blade runner reference when the bus first goes to the Las Vegas-esque town? It’s a billboard with a geisha-type character that plays and replays every 3 seconds. Anyone else see this?,rmf0do
hrppcr2,"Just as good as the first, with a major caveat: this one is even less original than the first. Otherwise it’s the best Illumination franchise by a long shot, and arguably the best jukebox musicals since… ever!

I think that, while the ending is a bit too happy (no bitter sweetness in this film really) it reminded me why I love theater and why I’m encouraging my dream of being in entertainment (as a behind the scenes guy).

The best 7:10 film I’ve ever seen.

hrxyzcb,This movie rocks ! Bono's performance was stellar ! Coldplay songs were simply amazing ! Lady Nooshy and miss Portia were charismatic and had simply amazing musical numbers. A sequel done right ! I rate it 9/10. The Bono/Clay scenes were very touching. It teaches you that it is worth it to keep living and building a better future even when your loved ones observe you from heaven.,rmf0do
hsu1iwm,"I’m so glad it was as great as the first one, even better actually. My only criticism is that I wish we saw more of a backstory from clay. When ash was at his home alone I think they could have had a heart to heart and he could have told some stories about his life with his wife. The turning point of him deciding to return to the show with ash happened too fast. But still I enjoyed every minute and porsha was so entertaining. I love when she walked over to her father and sang in his face just to rub her rebellious act in.",rmf0do

htou5u5,"Loved it!

From a voice-acting standpoint, Bono killed it! I would assume that performances can sometimes be a bit unemotional and flat from someone that doesn't have a lot of experience acting, but the emotion that Bono brought as Calloway, from the initial sadness and anger through to fear and anxiety, I felt it the whole way.

Shout out to Pharrell Williams and Halsey as well. Not experienced actors/voicers but still delivered a great performance and really brought their respective characters to life.

Actually, everyone in this film was great!",rmf0do

i48vyqt,"um? f-ing amazing? honestly i did not expect this movie to be this good? the pop song cover thing can get a little gimmicky, and id say that's probably my least favorite part of the show (that and that damn furry self-insert wolf girl) but i feel like the show handles an ensemble cast without losing you on any of the storylines or emotional beats of the plot, which is very impressive. i also watched it at home in 4k and the animation was absolutely f ing stunning. honestly, this is the 1st 3d animated feature ive seen that actually makes me feel like 3d animation could replace 2d animation or regular filmography in artistry. the scenes at calloway's house look particularly goregeous. the detail in his courdoruy jacket, plus the way they rendered the lighting and the flash off of his front door in the sun, plus the lens flare in the scene where they're riding on his motorcycle were just the best thing ive ever seen in 3d. the show at the end was similarly breathtaking and i love how they really conveyed the absolute massiveness of the theater and hotel spaces in a way that really enhanced the storytelling and the sense that - yeah, this is an expensive, sumptuous, intimidating space.
 not to mention all the characters are likeable and interesting to an all ages audience. Reese Witherspoon gives an amazing performance as Rosita, and Ms Crawley is honestly one of the funniest characters ive seen. the gimmicky pop songs and overuse of autotune is honestly the only flaw in this movie; it pulls off everything else absolutely beautifully.",rmf0do
hrlrlfu,"Honestly definitely an improvement to the first one. The music was fine and choreography was ok at best. One really notable thing in the movie was Clay Calloway. Almost every scene with him was very endearing especially someone who has dealt with loss. To be honest I would have loved a movie instead about calloways come up pence and how he his loss affected him. Despite the few good emotional scenes within the movie they are very brief and overall don’t really matter because he just changes his mind about playing music off screen which was underwhelming. I understand that I shouldn’t except Pixar quality from illumination but I still don’t think I should have to lower my standards because a movie studio is incompetent. 
Overall a 5/10",rmf0do
hrr8neo,"I watched this a week ago and had all these questions that I wanted to come on Reddit and ask.  But my screening ended at 1 AM and I went to bed instead.  So here is the only thing I can remember wanting to vent about -- Buster says he can get Clay Calloway to agree to star in a Las Vegas show despite having disappeared for a decade.  Mr. Crystal says he has to do it or else he'll kill him.  Then Buster comes back with Clay Calloway, this impossible feat, and instead of getting excited he pulled this off and that this missing guy has resurfaced and is in the room with him, he's now insistent ""My daughter has to star in the show or I'll kill you.""  So the show is cancelled but there's a huge turn-out (the reason he wanted Clay Calloway basically, to ensure there's a huge turnout) and Mr. Crystal comes down, sees his daughter in the show, calls her a traitor and almost successfully kills Buster.  But why?  Because Buster got Clay Calloway and his daughter was featured in the show.  I mean, I know they made some attempt at explaining this but logically, it makes no sense.  He threatened Buster because his daughter wasn't featured in the show but then he walks in and she is and he calls her a traitor.  Huh?

I did have to laugh when one character tries to connect with the elusive Clay Calloway and he uses all his security to send her far away since he's stayed alone for ten years.  The next group tries to connect with him, he is worried about their safety, lets them come inside, and says ""You can only stay one night.""",rmf0do

hu42grs,"As unpopular (or not) as this opinion may be. My favorite character from this movie has to be Porsha. I absolutely love how Disney managed to in my opinion accurately portray how its really like being a ""spoiled brat"". The fact that on the surface level to people you're around with in public it seems like you just have everything handed to you on a silver platter (which isn't necessarily untrue), but the fact that there is also a ""behind-the-scenes"" where the reason for this could be that you may have a parent(s) who doesn't seem to really care about you and you use your ""spoiledness"" as a coping mechanism.

\- ""And it's you when I look in the mirror"" - everything reminded him of his wife

\-  ""Listen to me now, I need to let you know, you don't have to go it alone"", could be Ash's words to Calloway

\- ""You're the reason I sing, you're the reason why the opera is in me"" - his wife was the reason he started singing again.

My brother ended up watching with me and he usually doesn't like these kinds of movies and ended up sitting through both. He laughed a few times, especially with Ms. Crawley's eye rolling. 

And despite seeing the big reveal with Bono the Lion at the end multiple times in multiple trailers, that scene still had me shook. My brother said he never expected to get choked up by a movie like this before.

Halsey's character was great too. Takes some good acting and directing to act badly.

Had a lot of fun with these movies. Would  put it on for a bunch of kids on repeat and I wouldn't mind.",rmf0do

Does not disappoint. Does. Not 

I also wonder what happened to Eddie? Miss that sheep. Glad to his Nana though. Not so much with Mike, but I'm sure he's ok. Seth's Sinatra voice is  impeccable, but his role suited the first film well enough.  

Lastly, Bono!! ♥️ Ironically, I haven't thought of Bono for so many years until Sing 2 first aired its trailer months ago. I'm so glad that he's in this one. I did not know what Bono's speaking voice sounded like until the trailer. Well done, Bono. Well done!",rmf0do

ie5zhf3,"Honestly MAYBE a 3/10 on a good day. Singing was great (as you expect from a movie titled sing) but the writing was lazy. Mr. Moon’s entire life’s purpose was to open that lousy theater and now he just tosses it aside for Vegas? Every character had the push they needed at exactly the right moment to make the final play happen? Mr. Crystal was Trump (cue same speech patterns and hotel ownership here)? Mr. Moon left behind the theater he spent his entire life trying to open to go to Vegas and continue his plays there? The daughter, who basically was the reason moon was gonna be killed, decided not to be a b***h 10 minutes before the play and learned a whole new song/dance and got a costume ready? The lion did one show and decided he was gonna come out of retirement for a bunch of people he’s never met?….

hr6t5r2,"I thought that this one had a lot more to say about the struggles of BEING an entertainer but being stuck in mediocrity, whereas the first one dealt with trying to be an entertainer. The first one tackles themes we’ve seen dozens of times: “can I make it” “am I good enough”, etc. but this one takes it a step further by being like “okay, we’re doing what we want to do…but what we want to do might not be as satisfying or sustaining as we thought…” and my god I cannot believe I’m going this in depth about Sing 2.


In all seriousness, I think Johnny’s storyline in this was about devotion to the art and the abuse and pressure that ourselves and others can put on creativity in order to be “perfect” when that might not be organic or healthy. That really resonated with me as an actor whose in an industry that can be conducted by really abusive people, or even someone pushing your boundaries past. That scene where he runs out of the dance class and slams his skateboard on the ground? I’ve felt that exact way. You can put all the effort in you want but sometimes the pressure you put on yourself will make you burn out.



Damn. Who’d have thought that these silly little singing animals would bring up these kind of conversations?",rmf0do
i5fj33k,"Yeah, I was into all the story lines except Johnny. It seemed forced, and the Acapella for Sky Full of Stars (while sounding fine) was super cringey.

Like, okay, the show choreographer is upset that he got extra help, so he's going to dance fight the star on opening night, and change the show.... And that's going to motivate Johnny to then, what? Become a better ninja? He didn't improve any dancing, or singing, he just hit his teacher's stick away, then broke his teacher's stick, then hit his teacher in the nose and stared him down. I'm so lost on what his story arc was supposed to be.

Neither movie predominantly features pop songs played constantly on the radio- this movie actually goes out of its way to pretty heavily feature U2 given Bono's involvement.

It’s absolutely phenomenal.  Anyone giving it 2/10, 3/10 has a screw loose.  It’s freaking 10/10.  The writing is utterly perfect.  I can’t say enough about this movie.  I can’t believe I am saying that about a CARTOON, but I have to give credit when it is due, and it is most certainly due.",rmf0do
hs30tcn,"Because it wasn’t that good. First one had much more structure to it, this one was an ADHD fest of music every 18 seconds, good for entertaining kids yea but as a movie, pretty damn weak and boring.",rmf0do
hryl9j7,I watched it yesterday and rated it a 2/10.,rmf0do
hrynhp8,Ahhhh... So you have probably 200+ positive comments about the movie and you're paying attention to the one sort of negative comment?,rmf0do
hqrr9rt,Oh thank God I’m not the only one. I only stopped myself from crying because I refused to cry at Sing 2.,rmf0do

Fucking SOBBED when his wife was there, in background lighting with whisps drifting back, it wasn't just a shot through the heart it was ARTFUL. Damn. I've seen it four times in three days since (autistic kiddo loves it lol) and I cry every time.",rmf0do
hwtmot3,I cried and cried,rmf0do

hsz3az5,"Also this is post rocketman taron are are talking about so Its even more sweeter they included more of his songs.

Also, total concidence but the outfit wore by taron and buster is nearly the same in the goodbye yellow brick road scene",rmf0do
hqq86cy,"If anything, his ""Frank Sinatra"" character would have fit in even more with the Vegas aspect.  He could have mouthed off to Mr. Crystal and they could have had some back and forths, would definitely have a scene where he's out gambling and enjoying the nightlife, definitely was potential there.  I think the more plausible reason is Seth just didn't want to do it.",rmf0do
hqhozgu,I at least hope they make some short film explains his fate. What’s the point of having his girlfriend go all the way there and save him only to kill them both off anyways?,rmf0do

hxwo3p2,"God, his character was THE worst.",rmf0do
i0k02m8,"The dance instructor is like jk Simmons character in whiplash. They beat perfection out of the people they are training which is unhealthy and unsustainable as it causes a lot of stress, anxiety and even depression. See how Johnny was shaking it was because of that. It is also about proving yourself.",rmf0do
htpox8v,"Eddie was Buster's friend, the sheep, Nana's grandson.",rmf0do
hqg1bwr,Do you know what song played when the crew first arrives in Redshore city? I cannot find it for the life of me. It was a Flaming Lips type track with ambient horns on it and a tambourine or a shaker maybe? Considering seeing it again just to sneak a quick shazam in lol I really dug that track.,rmf0do

hrr8ujt,More like when Justin Timberlake was acknowledged for his comedy skills on SNL and then just became an actor for a bit.,rmf0do
hqzd5i9,"I think the song wasn't the point, it was about the character finding joy. For the audience of the show seeing a musician who vanished appear and play his ""THAT"" song chorus is more than enough.",rmf0do

hq895wt,"Ya prob just recency bias, but just a few scenes and the delivery of dialogue plus having his name on the building. Definitely a stretch,was curious if anyone else thought it",rmf0do

hq89a4l,Lol,rmf0do
hqmejkt,And don’t forget the buzzing off of all the auditions. It was a total slap on Trump from Hollywood. So typical and rather ruined the movie for me.,rmf0do

Also found this thread, just a lot later...",rmf0do
hq9301g,Was honestly just hoping for a post credit appearance or some explanation. But I'll assume the mafia bears ate him,rmf0do
hvdjs1o,Also I don't think his character would be part of the show at the Moon Theatre as he was only interested in the money. He only came back to sing because of his pride in the first one. So it fit him not being in it. I suppose they could have picked him up somewhere like they did Ash if they really wanted him in it.,rmf0do
huu0wwx,Think they’re tarsiers lol,rmf0do

hqdj151,"Me too... I was trying to place the accent and it sounds like something Keegan would try.

Then I just realized it was Eric Andre. Pretty surprised to hear him in a kid's movie... he was great",rmf0do
hstz3kl,"> then he was going to kill him because it got out to the news and made Mr Crystal look bad. 

But at this point, Clay was in and Mr. Crystal didn't even care.  And so he was mad he didn't get Clay, he was mad his daughter got demoted, and he was mad it leaked to the news.  But the first two became a mute point and then he literally kills him (if not for an aerial stunt saving him) because it got leaked to the news?  That is just silly.",rmf0do
hruthbp,"Yeah, I can't complain.  I saw it in 3D which was really fun.",rmf0do

hqdh71f,Ok glad I wasn’t just having a stroke!,rmf0do
ht7jakk,I felt bad for Jimmy too until he threatened to murder Buster. Up until then he was just intimidating lol,rmf0do
hqpoota,"Yeah I actually think the song selections in these movies are surprisingly subversive. They have a good range of songs. Went to see this movie with my family, and there were songs my mom was bopping to that I didn't know, and when ""Could Have Been Me"" came on I loved it, because that's more a song from my era. I liked how they have a good selection of songs from across different eras of music; I highly doubt kids are gonna care if they know the song or not, so it's a good way of allowing audiences from a lot of different age groups to connect to the film in some small way.",rmf0do
icbfeih,"as someone who just watched the 4k release, you were right, its phenomenal",rmf0do

idulm6a,"I’m late, but that’s when I started crying, and then I basically didn’t stop after that. But his song and Ash + Clay were my favorite songs of the show. I was on an airplane and thinking ppl must think I’m crazy for crying at Sing 2! Glad I’m not the only one.",rmf0do

i50csld,"FFS this is why I hate the internet, shoddy crap being believed by every naive cunt out there. Why would they 'kill off' a mouse in a kids movie??  Nothing was even confirmed even IMDB has it in the trivia section just AGH x100

hqi2mnv,Was it Holes by Mercury Rev? Checked the soundtrack and found a song on the sing 2 soundtrack that sounded close enough in my memory so I'm pretty sure it's that,rmf0do
hq1cttu,"Hi. Yes,  it was only about SING 2:  it was a screening and q and a. I'm a member of one of the entertaimment guilds/associations so during awards season there are a number of screenings/panels open to  us.",rmf0do
hq80uit,"He largely spoke about Bono because that's who the moderator kept asking him about. Then for the questions portion, they let kids ask the questions so there wasn't really anything of substance from that as it was just him indulging kids telling him how they would beat up Mr. Crystal (voiced by Bobby Cannavale).   
He said the germs of an idea for the sequel was in place while he was still working on the first one.   
Garth said he is a huge Prince fan and was excited to use ""Let's Go Crazy"" in the film. He has a towel that Prince threw into the audience at a concert he attended and owns a bunch of Prince merch.   
Spoke about asking Bono to voice the role of Clay. Bono offered to audition as he wanted to be sure he was what they wanted and if he could actually do it well. Bono mentioned writing a song for the film but Garth didn't think he meant it .Then it came time for Bono to lay down some lines and he surprised Garth with the song. Garth was worried that he may not like it and was trying to figure out away to school his face in case he didn't like it, but he loved it.   
Talked about the longest scene to get was (I don't know if you've seen the film) where the gang makes their way to Crystal's hotel and they're trying to be inconspicuous in the kitchen and one of the characters is pushing a mop. It took the animators a long time to get that one done.",rmf0do

hpnwhrw,I just saw it in the middle of the day in the middle of the week at a theater with two showings an hour and the theater was completely packed boards to rafters (probably a 200 seat theater).

hq7gjjw,its actually meena....,rmf0do
hppwi20,>!I mean it's the entire premise of the movie from the get go. It is hardly surprising that the promise to get him to perform has a climax of him actually singing. It does kind of suck that they dropped the song and his entrance in a trailer but it shouldn't really have surprised anyone to begin with...!<,rmf0do
hstzx61,"He says Clay is coming while being dangled over a balcony, how is Crystal supposed to know he wasn't just saying anything to save his own hide? His daughter wasn't even back in the show to his own knowledge until he shows up to it later.",rmf0do
ht7sa3c,"Yeah, but Moon was literally using all of Jimmy's resources just to ""follow his dreams"". I can understand Jimmy's anger, but attempted murder was a little too far. Both are just as selfish imo",rmf0do
htl4lly,"Yeah, I also think they went a bit too far by making Jimmy actually trying to kill Moon.

Then he finds out his daughter isn't in the show... he's embarrassed 'cause it makes his daughter look like she has no talent.  Then at the end, he finds out the big star is in the show, his daughter is in the show, and it's a big success that will recoup his investment.  But is still angry for no reason.",rmf0do
