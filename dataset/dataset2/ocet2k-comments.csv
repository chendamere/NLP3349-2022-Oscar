h3vyrzd,"I just feel so mad that this amazing festival was left to languish in relative obscurity until now, despite the massive talent surrounding it.  How?  Why?",ocet2k
h3vy008,"That moon landing & Staple Singers performance segment is a masterclass of editing. 
This whole film was terrific.",ocet2k
h3xslcc,"The gobsmacking solo rendition of “My Girl” by Temptations singer David Ruffin is alone worth the watch. Wow. But there are so many absolutely incredible performances captured beautifully on film. The documentary context of the event is also well done, but there were several times when I was watching some mind-blowing performance and then they cut to an interview and I was like noooooooo!! So hopefully someday they release “Summer of Soul: The Full Performances,” which I would buy in a heartbeat.",ocet2k
h3utqqq,"So damn good. I knew all these artists going in but I’d never heard these versions. Gladys Knight & The Pips, Sly & The Family Stone, and Nina Simone at the end were all flat out spectacular.",ocet2k
h3w1t5e,"Fantastic doc. I really loved Quest’s exchange with Darryl (I believe that’s who it was) at the end. I can only imagine how it must have felt knowing that this really did happen, and it wasn’t just a moment stored in someone’s collective memory bank, but also so far removed that it felt like it didn’t really happen. Hope it makes the Documentary list for the Oscars next year",ocet2k
h45043m,"The Mavis Staples - Mahalia Jackson footage is the most transfixed I’ve been to the screen this past year. That’s the best scene of any movie I’ve watched in awhile. 

The direction by Questlove is revelatory. Brilliant all around.",ocet2k
h42cvpe,"It was really good but I wish they had more info on the original cinematographer who held onto the footage for 50 years and included some info about how this film came to be. 

I really appreciated they cultural context stuff - the moon landing stuff was really interesting and gave me a perspective on history I wasn’t taught in school. 

I really hope they can get the licenses together and put a compilation record out. It would be incredible.

The editing was great too.",ocet2k
h3vping,"I just finished watching it and it is making me so hype. It’s not just about the music, and as a music teacher that is a total NERD for music history, this is incredible. But hot damn, the music (which I grew up with), is insanely phenomenal.",ocet2k
h3zng17,I would buy the box set of this whole festival.,ocet2k
h3u1cde,One of the best music docs I’ve seen in a while. Excellent footage.,ocet2k
h3vs1rp,"Really loved this. I actually live across the street from Mt. Morris Park, and it was really incredible to think all of this took place right outside my window fifty years ago. I think my personal highlights were Mahalia Jackson letting the spirit of four hundred years pour right out of her, and then the end with Nina Simone being so amazing and powerful in the way that only she can. Well done, Questlove.",ocet2k
h4bq7ay,"If this were just a collection of performance footage, it would be four stars. The interviews and the culture/historical context push it to the top level. It was such a great decision to include so many interviews with regular festival-goers. 

Also, Stevie Wonder is a goddamn performer. Wow.",ocet2k
h3zt992,"I went into this looking forward to the music, and the music was spectacular. But about 30 minutes into it I was more interested in what Questlove was trying to say with the film. There are some insanely powerful moments in this movie.

Also, watch to the very end of the credits. There's a little clip at the end that's hilarious and worth waiting for.",ocet2k
h3twfi6,"I saw this as part of Sundance's online festival this year.  It's really good, the archival film is great, some terrific performances, and great stories.",ocet2k
h43fk8h,Let’s not forget the Latino and African performers too. It was a great melding of so many genres. I hope we will see a release of full performances from all the bands/singers.,ocet2k
h3twlcm,"The extended title of this film includes: **(or... When the Revolution Could Not be Televised)** 

and I feel like that's quintessential to the name of and discussion of the doc.",ocet2k
h4w74qi,Anyone know what that was all about with stevie at the end of the credits?,ocet2k
h6lwslj,"This was amazing and beautiful. Can’t believe I didn’t know this happened or existed. Stellar performances, fantastic fashion, the colors and variety of artists. I’ll be honest, I teared up a few times. Wonderful.",ocet2k
h6swhff,This was the uplifting watch I needed after that heavy Woodstock doc. Seeing Stevie go all out was amazing.,ocet2k
h3u2c29,"It’s REALLY good. I was worried it would be more concert film than documentary, but it’s the PERFECT blend of both. Go watch this.",ocet2k
h3ze6dw,"Thank goodness for Questlove. His music history drive is truly amazing. 

Misty eyed from the second Little Stevie Wonder threw down on the drum set.",ocet2k
h49znd8,Yeah i need a box set of this. Want to see the performances without commentary (even though its great) they did sonny sharrock dirty by only showing a tiny bit of his performance with all that other music/commentary on top of it. FREE JAZZ FOREVER,ocet2k
h3u1qjo,"Totally going to watch this now, thanks for the heads up.",ocet2k
h3zodpn,"What a great film,  awesome music, and spectacular fashion and dances.

Amazing look at the era, and so much fun to see the artists watch themselves and get so emotional",ocet2k
h48a3py,"I guess I'm disappointed becuse it wasn't what i was expecting  i went in  expecting a modern-day Wattstax,  Not a  traditional documentary documentary reflecting on the  politics and music  and of the era and it's meaning to the black community which is fine. I'll  give  2nd chance now that i know that.

Still I feel quest love should have let the footage speak for it's self more.",ocet2k
h41zvyy,Anyone know if there is an album of the music?,ocet2k
h4dh1eu,Questlove did an amazing job. Loved this doc and it never lost steam. I also saw the Sparks Brothers doc which was pretty good but definitely loses steam for the last hour. I hope they eventually release all the footage available from the Harlem Cultural Festival. These performances are stunning and deserve to be seen in full.,ocet2k
hxql1kv,"Finally saw it, expected more of a concert film than a documentary but it was very very good. Added a lot of context to why the music was important. 

Nina Simone’s poem rendition is gonna piss off a lot of people though. 

A-",ocet2k
h3twb2m,"Loved this. So many great performances that have their own historical/political significance to the time, often reflecting a lot of the issues that this country is still dealing with. The audio is fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Gospel section, even though I've never been a huge fan of the genre (until recently).",ocet2k
h43dyvo,"Stunning stunning film and stunning performances by all the artists.  
Thank you ?uestlove",ocet2k
h637xof,"Man this was so good, surprised there’s not more discussion about it considering it’s on Hulu.",ocet2k
h4u1i90,Just INCREDIBLE,ocet2k
h465s3q,The editing was insane. Like .7 second clips strung together back to back to back. So many cuts. It was jarring.,ocet2k
hqufmr9,"Anybody has information on the stage band members ? (musical director, drummer, bass, horns etc.)",ocet2k
h3w1nlq,"White people. That’s really it. That poem at the end by Nina is something white people wouldn’t (and let’s be honest, most still wouldn’t) be able to handle.... even though white people rioted over 2 black people going to their college.",ocet2k
h56204u,"I saw ""Summer of Soul"" at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati for the second time last night. I have been so overwhelmed by this movie the first time ( a week ago) that seeing it a second time was a no-brainer, and in fact I may go see it yet again. I see a lot of movies. This movie is THE BEST MOVIE OF 2021 to date. Moreover, I will go on record already that this will get an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.   
All that aside: is anyone as perplexed as I am that (i) there is no soundtrack released, not even as a download, and (ii) I have not been able to track down in any way, shape or form, a listing of all the songs that are featured in the documentary. Has anyone had any better luck?",ocet2k
h3w24oa,"That was probably my favorite part besides Stevie’s performance and the ending. That moment where you saw how blacks and whites felt about the moon landing is what really tied the film, and the festival itself, together for me.",ocet2k
h46dm3p,"The editing of the 60s icons dying with the next one to die talking about the previous one’s death (i.e. Malcolm talking about JFK, Martin talking about Malcom, Bobby talking about Martin) was subtle but wildly impactful at quickly conveying the thread they all shared.",ocet2k
h467bo4,"While watching my mother said - ""Who ever edited this should win awards"".

I agree. The editing was off the charts.

Questlove had the footage and put it on a loop anywhere he went for 4 or 5 months - but it was in the edit that it became great.",ocet2k

>The direction by Questlove is revelatory. Brilliant all around.

Normally I'd be inclined to resist all the cut-ins of interviews during the performances, but they're edited in over the music with such a rhythm and potency that they just belong there.  This thing just sizzles the whole length, it's amazing.",ocet2k
h8h3chn,"I cannot stop thinking about it. Moved my bones watching it on my laptop in 2021, can only imagine how it must have felt to hear and witness that in 1969 at Mount Morris Park",ocet2k

h4bcioy,A making-of would be fantastic.,ocet2k
h3zdicc,"Dear Questlove,

Thank you for mapping out my History of American Music curriculum!

Sincerely,
Every HS Music teacher",ocet2k
h4141ru,"Absolutely. I mean, in the movie we get one or two BOMBASTIC performances from each artist. What was left on the cutting room floor?",ocet2k
h44y9ws,I want the playlist!!,ocet2k
h4lfuq3,"I can't wrap my head around how Wonder was only NINETEEN years old when this happened.

This movie was phenomenal.",ocet2k
h4zy2q5,"Is that guy Berry Gordy?

He wasn’t known for treating his artists well. Same as every other record exec. 

In 1969, 19-year-old Stevie already had 10(!) albums under his belt. As a minor, all of his royalty earnings were held in a trust until he was 21. Which was just over a year away. 

And also when his Motown contract was up. 

I think we’re seeing Stevie letting Berry know who held all the cards here. 

Stevie got everything he wanted when he turned 21.

h46jk6u,"I watched that clip.  I recall seeing them interact near the beginning of the film, and, at the time, I felt that whatshisname was uncomfortable with Stevie Wonder getting in his personal space.  The end tied in perfectly with that.  Yet, at the same time, my sympathy wasn't with Mr. Wonder.  Frankly, while it *was* funny, it also felt cruel.",ocet2k
h3ty7fr,"Same, it was definitely one of the better films for me.",ocet2k
h3u1a5x,Agreed.,ocet2k
hjpl63x,I’m curious why that little tense exchange was included (hidden at the end) too. 🤔,ocet2k

h3w1x0j,"Sounds about right.  A festival with a roster like that deserves to be revered as the stuff of legend, and it’s appalling, criminal, even, that it isn’t.  Hopefully this film changes that.",ocet2k

h44tojb,THIS!,ocet2k
hxqh6bg,Old comment but there is a soundtrack on Apple Music now. Not sure if it’s all the songs though (and seems out of order?),ocet2k
i1msq40,If you watch the credits all the songs down to Stevie Wonder’s Drum Solo are listed… hope you caught that in one of your multiple viewings.,ocet2k
h43g9gp,I think saying “how whites and blacks felt” is far too stark. The news likes to present shocking sound bites and it is very possible that not everyone felt like the people interviewed. Pretty sure there were white kids at Woodstock who would have the same sentiments as the black kids. My dad was military and he and his black friends would have said the same as the white adults. I’m not saying that one is right and one is wrong I’m just saying that it’s not black and white.,ocet2k
hvy1gd0,Yo! I didn't even really catch that.,ocet2k
hs15qiy,I really expected Questlove to use it during the Apollo 11 footage. Maybe in the editing room it came across as too on-the-nose?,ocet2k

h42yqmc,"Part of it is that it wasn't a festival, it was a series of concerts that took place over the course of a couple of months.  So it didn't have the same aura and get as much attention as Woodstock, which was all packed into 3 days .",ocet2k
h3w2tlb,"It’s easier said than done my friend. It sucks to say, but if it wasn’t for Questlove, that film footage would still be waiting to be released by someone who wanted to make it happen. 

I really commend Questlove for bringing this to light, cause I had heard of “Black Woodstock” once I actually saw the Woodstock film for the first time and became obsessed with the event, but so little was known based on my searches, I thought it wasn’t a big thing. Quest did a fantastic job showing how much this event meant to black people",ocet2k
h4dogl2,"> White people back then

I’m sorry. I’m a little confused by that statement. Are you talking about the white people back in the 60s? Or the white people that elected a reality tv host as President under the guise of white supremacy, and then created an insurrection over the fact he lost? You should clarify on that 

> Don’t count me in as a generalization cause of my skin color 

This is always an interesting response to me. The white race seems to be the only one that doesn’t look at themselves in the context of race. They’re the only one where the people feel we should look at the individual, and not the race as a whole. As I recall, there was no point in Nina’s poem where she said “are you ready to fight?... except for that whitey over there that showed up in support. Good on them.” As a white Jew, she was calling us all out.

Your defensive response to my comment is what I was talking about when I said most white people wouldn’t be able to handle it. Your response is just more subtle than a lot of other white people who would have an outright problem with it.",ocet2k
hxty0q8,"I haven't seen the Apple Music listing, but in fact the official soundtrack was released on CD about a month ago. Very generous (80 min. running time), but nevertheless very incomplete. I don't understand why they didn't release it as a double CD. The running order of the songs is exactly as we hear and see it in the documentary, though.

Here a link to Amazon's listing of the CD:

[https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Televised-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B09MYVY9X9?ref=pf\_ov\_at\_pdctrvw\_dp](https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Televised-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B09MYVY9X9?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_dp)

And just in case you weren't aware of it, the DVD is now out as well. Sadly its a straight reissue of the film, and hence no bonus materials whatsoever.
