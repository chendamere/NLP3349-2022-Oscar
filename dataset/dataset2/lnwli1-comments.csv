go31q4k,"As a Korean, I have nothing but admiration for Steven Yeun. I still remember cracking up when he spoke broken Korean in Okja and Burning (used as a comedic effect), but in Minari, his Korean is nearly perfect. Korean is one of the most difficult languages to master in pronunciation, and it’s clear that he took the time to make his performance as authentic as possible.",lnwli1

go3oy0h,"Just finished watching it with my brothers. Going to watch it again with our parents as a whole family.

As a fellow Asian-American immigrant, this movie means so much to me. It was the first time in cinema that I saw my family and there were so many moments that had me recalling my own childhood and my own experiences. Representation has always mattered and I truly understand why now.

It’s also just a really beautiful film. Well-written and well-paced, it never felt too long or overbearing. The acting was top notch and Alan Kim just makes me want to adopt him.

Definitely worth the watch, especially if you’re coming from an Asian background.

Also, I miss my grandma.",lnwli1
go3fygl,The acting chemistry between the boy and grandma was astounding. Alan Kim truly deserves all the praise for his role in this.,lnwli1
go3n9f0,"“Minari, Minari, Wonderful, Wonderful”

A sweet, tender, and authentic look into a Korean family moving into the United States and vying for that elusive American Dream. Sometimes that Dream can be so intoxicating that it can get in the way of family and the failure can be devastating.

You can tell this was close to the heart of writer/director Lee Isaac Chung and surely inspired from his childhood. Assimilation into any foreign  culture can be difficult and is unique for every family.

Great performances from the cast especially the female leads. Minari is one best films of 2020",lnwli1
goa5z0b,"A new thing I picked upon a rewatch of the film. During the first major row between Monica and Jacob, she chastises him for sending money and providing for his side of the family over hers, and later on with Jacob's defensive resentment over Monica calling their current living environment as being that of 'hillbillies'. Little touches like this make me think that Jacob probably came from a poor family initially, and probably grew up in the countryside in contrast to Monica who must've grown up in the city. He probably picked up the idea for growing Korean vegetables from his childhood.

Jacob doesn't socialise as easily as Monica. Take for example at the church's social gathering, and many other occasions, he just can't seem to open himself up to people. And it's not even a language thing - his English is noticeably better than Monica's, he just can't. He's very pent up, only Paul and David seem to really be able to crack his facade at points and even then it's very momentary. He doesn't seem to have much going for him besides his dream.

In a sense the whole film is Jacob trying to live out a youthful dream and gradually watch it get torn apart. The entire film you watch Steven Yeun's face as his soul crumbles underneath. Devastating.",lnwli1

go6cwo9,"I really loved how non-showy it was. It felt so down to Earth. I think the film could have done more to explore Anne's perception of events, but it has some of the best emotional payoff I've seen of any 2020 film. Giving the grandmother a stroke right after her big bonding moment with David also seemed like a bit of a shortcut to drama, but Youn's performance still made me feel terrified for her well being. I think the Supporting Actress race this year is between her and Bakalova.",lnwli1
gof7zk7,"Can we talk about how vividly realised the sense of history between Monica and Jacob was? I love films where without flashbacks or even obvious dialogue, we get such a beautiful sense of their relationship and how it has come to this point. Really so much credit to the screenplay and how it creates the richness of the interactions with one another, as well as the actors. The scene between Yeun and Han as Monica is bathing Jacob in the bathtub speaks volumes (also, Steven Yeun's biceps tho).",lnwli1

go3iat8,"Steven Yeun and Alan Kim are getting all the praises, as they should be, but I was especially touched by acting by the ladies who portrayed the grandma and the wife. Youn as the grandma was striking and much deserves the attention but the wife especially was heartbreaking to watch in a more subtle, delicate way. That scene of the couple’s fight close to the end, her unshed tears really got to me. Trying to be a realist in the face of her husband’s dream, or the bit about how he sent his parents in Korea the money they made because he’s the first son in the family, so they have little money left for themselves but she can’t even be unhappy about it without her husband getting angry... all of that hit really close to home.",lnwli1
go34n0h,"I saw it yesterday in a cinema in Sydney (it was released here last Thursday). I absolutely loved it and can’t stop thinking about it. I think the grandmother truly came to heal the family, even if they didn’t realise it. I don’t want to say too much more and spoil it, but if you haven’t seen it - go. You’ll laugh and cry, and be uplifted by an authentic, deeply moving, beautifully told film.",lnwli1

go7c0db,"The scene of Jacob kneeling down in the fields smoking, distraught over the collapse of his dreams and the pain it's caused his family, and the final shot of Soon-ja's face looking over the family as they sleep, are such incredible scenes. For a film as beautifully written as this, it's amazing how its two best moments are entirely silent outside of that gorgeous Emile Mosseri score. Truly a universal film. Easily my favourite film of this awards season, hands down.",lnwli1
go3mkn4,"So the A24 Screening Room kicked me out to a Q&A ten minutes before the movie ended, and then it 404'd repeatedly when I tried to go back to the movie until it said that I could no longer view it.

Well, it was a great film but I wish I could see the ending!",lnwli1
gpaeexu,"Okay I'm not seeing this anywhere else but I thought there was significance in the grandma's stroke and David's heart healing. To me it was exchange, but further than one good and one bad occurrence. It was almost as if Soonja (the grandma) sacrificed a bit of herself, and gave up some of her life for David. In the dialogue before they both fell asleep that night, she was talking of protecting him, and then she woke up to illness. Not sure if this was intentional but something I noticed right away when i watched, especially with the religious/spiritual element of the film.",lnwli1
go3tazb,Alan Kim is a force to be reckoned with. The kid is a natural without doing anything showy.,lnwli1
gpicl9h,"People always talk about the ""abrupt ending"", but this is a slice of life, and this is exactly the type of ending it needs. We see them in a crucial point in their life, how they dealt with it, and everything has been resolved. 

David truly accepts Grandma. Jacob and Monica realize their love for each other is greater than their love of themselves. The family slept all together on the living room, even though they weren't willing to do that at the beginning. The minari plant, a symbol of their family, firmly takes root on American soil and begins to flourish.",lnwli1
go2u2ld,"My only criticism about this movie is that I felt it ended a bit too abruptly. Apart from that though, I loved how atmospheric and authentic it felt as someone who grew up in the culture myself. Generally the entire cast has gotten a lot of praise, but I don’t see enough love for Noel Cho’s performance as the daughter. She did such a great job conveying the older sister vibe, and just from a visual perspective she was perfectly cast as Han Yeri’s daughter (there are some shots from behind and the sides when I legitimately thought she was Han Yeri).",lnwli1

goyt8xa,"This was sooo good! Grandma was a fucking riot. I was screaming ""NOOOO!!!!"" at my TV when the barn was burning, it absolutely broke my heart. My only gripe is that the movie feels like it ends rather abruptly.

Favorite scene was the grandma bringing gochujang and other ingredients from Korea and the mom just crying out of happiness. That was such a small, human, relatable moment.",lnwli1
go332wo,"One of the most tender films i've seen recently, almost akin to something like a Hirokazu Koreeda film, with its huge focus on the strength of family and being able to persevere through hardships. I loved the camerawork and how it would get closeup with a slight shakiness that made it feel very ""in the moment"", the soundtrack was also incredibly soothing.",lnwli1
go5ftfd,"I thought it was well done but kind of slow. 

Some things I did like about it: 
- while it was a fish out of water story, it wasn’t about this family enduring racism in their new home. It’s more about the family dynamics. 
- they all slept on the floor together at the end :)
- the little boy



I’ll think of more things as they come to me. Just watched last night.",lnwli1
goiazbn,"There were so many things I related to (as a fellow 1.5 generation Korean-American who immigrated in the 1980s).

**Food**  
\- Drinking ""Mountain Dew"" and calling it Korean translation for ""Mountain Water."" Mountain water is supposed to be better for you than regular tap water.  
\- Grandmother bringing rare Korean ingredients to her daughter, including Korean herbal medicine. *We are so spoiled now with multiple choices in Korean supermarkets in the U.S. and the availability of so many things that weren't available. My aunt who immigrated in the 70s made kimchi with American cabbage.* 

**Language**  
\- OK, it was weird. Stephen Yeun plays a Korean immigrant, but his Korean accent is noticeable and his only slightly accented English is very good. *I will say his Korean has improved over the years. And apparently he had multiple language teachers in this movie.*  
\- It was also a little weird that the children spoke mostly in English to their parents and their parents responded in Korean. Apparently this is normal in some households.  
\- According to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8IyCyJXSGk) interview with Bong Joon Ho and Youn Yuh-jung (grandmother), the original script was written in English and then translated to Korean (for the Korean language parts, which is most). My Korean isn't great enough to notice if it made a difference.",lnwli1
gopw9gg,"this is one of the best movies i’ve ever seen and i really really connected with it. it had childlike wonder and beauty, but also portrayed a gritty reality of being an immigrant, struggling with money, and a marriage in shambles. i found it especially incredible as a first generation asian american, watching it with my korean grandmother (who hated it haha) and thinking about my past with her trying to push away the “koreanness” and the guilt of treating grandparents rudely as a kid. the cinematography was beautiful and the music choices were incredible. this movie also managed to be an american movie where main characters of color befriend white people without there being a sense of white saviorism which is honestly very rare. i loved the honesty of the film and i loved that it didn’t try to be anything more than it was, and i think it worked better that it didn’t have a very direct classic type plot.",lnwli1
gp9x2t4,"TL;DR: I adore this film.

There are many wondrous things to say about this movie. I just watched it for the first time today, ahead of the Golden Globes, and it blew me out of the water. I had high hopes, but Lee Isaac Chung and team somehow surpassed them.

As a first-generation Asian-American, I found a lot of elements of the film to be super relatable (though I am Filipino, I'd say there are a lot of similarities in the Asian immigrant experience).

I teared up at multiple points, the first time being when Monica reunites with her mom for the first time in presumably a long time. It was a cathartic embrace, and when Monica broke, so did I. She even cries about her mom bringing anchovies, and while Soonja comedically answers, ""You're crying again? Because of anchovies?"" it just reminded me of life's simple pleasures, and how a little remnant from home, especially for someone who feels like she's in a brand new world, can be so powerful.

Jacob and Monica as characters reminded me so much of my parents. My dad, in a way, and still to this day, operates with a chip on his shoulder, much like Jacob. Sometimes, it's to prove himself to the world -- he's always had this hungry, hard-working mindset (when you come from climbing trees for food, that hardens you). But most of the time, I think it's to just prove it to himself, that he can overcome the odds, and ultimately act on his #1 goal, and that is to provide a solid future and a better life for his wife and children. In the end, Jacob's goal is that, and together with Monica, they have a larger mission, and that is: all the hardship they endure is to ensure a better life for the kids. Monica's compassion and relentlessness reminded me of my mom -- along with her impatience with Jacob's hardheadedness. The threats of taking the kids somewhere else... it's valid. It's a scary world out there, and to try and find success and a place in the world in the middle of nowhere, USA, especially for an immigrant, is hard stuff.

Some movies move you and affect you to your bones, and to me, Minari is definitely one of those flicks. It's the kind of story I love and cherish, and it's the story that makes ME want to write about my parents' experiences of immigrating and assimilating in America. One of those flicks that resonates no matter what your race is, but speaking for myself, makes me certainly proud to be an Asian-American. The widespread acclaim this movie is receiving is amazing. I can't wait to watch again.",lnwli1
gpi3kdy,My girlfriend's grandma passed away from dimentia about 3 months ago. I put Minari on last night because she is a European living in Australia and I thought she would identify with the migration elements in the story. I had no idea about the grandma character. I looked over to her after the fire scene and she was crying uncontrollably. Like hyperventilation crying. Tears streaming and snot and everything. It took 3 hours for her to calm down and she had to put ice on her eyes this morning before work.,lnwli1

It's been great seeing more representation for Asian Americans and other groups.

And while I'm not Asian American myself, I think the film itself was relatable, to anyone who had immigrant parents, whose families struggled to achieve the ""American dream.""

I lost my grandma a couple years ago to Alzheimer’s, but she was one of the most loving, caring, and influential people in my life. She was funny, sweet, and had a bit of a sailor’s mouth. I see her in grandma Soonja in nearly every way. When Soonja had a stroke, I bawled because I felt all the emotions of seeing your grandma regressing to a point where she can’t take care of herself. Yuh-Jung Youn did such a fantastic job with this role and I don’t think anyone else could have shown the authenticity she did in this film.

Firstly, it was a fantastic movie absolutely incredible. However, one thing that confused me was when Paul (the white guy on the farm) was dragging the wooden cross back to his home presumably.

I know religion plays a huge part in many Korean family’s lives but I was just so surprised by the influence Christianity had on the storyline. When you watch the trailer, there’s like two shots inside that community church but A24 did an excellent job of hiding the religious element.

Most of the pressure against keeping Korean traditions comes from within the family. This family isn’t being threatened or bullied into Americanization, it’s something they want to do, to different extents. 

Instead the main conflict comes from the choice to go into small-scale agriculture, a very risky endeavor to stake your family’s finances on. I can understand why the church is the primary social gathering in this town. They need solid ground somewhere. Even if your farm goes under, you always have your brothers in faith.

The part where the older sister is kinda left with worrying about everyone and the grandchildren being embarrassed of their grandmother initially is so relatable and I think it's an Asian thing(?).

Many characters including the chicken sexer express their view on religion and their belief (or lack thereof) in it and I see no apparent motif in that.

The movie seemed to end abruptly so I didn't originally like it, I also think I've been too influenced by Hollywood to want a more solid conclusion and/or happy ending so I wasn't as satisfied.

I get they have to have drama to advance the plot, but I thought the fire didn't seem as believable - like why was the grandmother outside at night burning stuff? I get she was affected by her condition but still.

I thought the kids may be affected by racism in the small town but it was interesting to see other than some ignorance from the other kids they made friends. I also thought the farm helper may have been dangerous but it didn't go that way.

It really didn’t even seem like she wasn’t too unsupportive up until that point. I don’t know, it didn’t seem like an empty threat because clearly they had marriage issues but some piece was missing because it seemed hollow to me.

And the more stacks put against you - being an immigrant, not being able to speak the language as well, culture shock, kids, grandma, etc. the more shit you have to get through. Immigrants are still sold this idea - my grandparents believed it and a lot of others did too. Because it is the luck of the draw, this is why the idea of the American Dream still exists. But it's movies like this one that just gets it and everything about it is a symbol of what this idea really does to so many lives and families.

I did really like this movie. I can see why it didn't win Best Picture though cause there were some weird plot holes and the ending was a little rushed.

It's a positive, hopeful ending that makes you feel good and realize what really matters, which is love and family.

Some major spoilers.

>!The barn burning is the climax of the movie. It happens right after Jacob finally secures a deal with a Korean supermarket. He finally gets what he wants, even if it costs him his family. Soon-ja, the grandmother, accidentally burns the barn while she is trying to be helpful and staunchly independent despite her condition. While Jacob is busy trying to save the harvest, Monica joins him. It's a fruitless task with smoke and fire engulfing the entire barn. Jacob and Monica abandon the barn and save each other. The entire harvest is destroyed and, subsequently, the business deal is killed as well. Jacob loses everything right after earning what he worked so hard for. But, despite that, I think he finally understood for the very first time in the film exactly what the farm means to Monica as well. For Monica, the farm cost everything. It cost her a comfortable life in Los Angeles, it cost her money, time, and most of all, it cost her marriage. That's why Monica is so much more devastated by the fire. She's bawling while Jacob is holding onto her. I think it's Jacob's realization that finally resulted in a turning point for Jacob and Monica.!<

>!And then there's David running after his grandmother. The previous night, David is resentful of his grandmother, and not able to fully understand and handle her stroke. David shows the love and courage he has for his grandmother by running after her despite his heart condition.!<

>!Then the next morning after the fire, the last look that the grandmother has when she sees the family says it all. The worst case scenario ended up happening with the Yi family losing their harvest after finally securing a deal. But despite all that they see the importance of each other as a family. And they're left with Soon-ja's Minari to the family, a tangible reminder of her wisdom and love. I couldn't think of a better way to end it.!<",lnwli1

gok0v7b,"I think the fire burning his crops could represent the burning away of his selfish desires for the farm and the bad ""fruit"" it was producing.

For the whole film Jacob works on the farm separate from his family and basically tries to do everything on his own. It causes strife between him and Monica and almost causes the family to split. In the final scenes though you can see things change.

Right after the fire the family all sleep together in the living room which could be a way of showing that each person wants to stay together as a family now. They are also all physically connected to each by their arms which I think strengthens that idea.

After that you see Jacob walking the land with Monica, Paul, and the dowsing stick guy and setting a stone down. This scene shows that this new farm is going to be built together with his wife and that he is now willing to rely on others. The stone is just marking a water source but I think you could read it as him and his wife laying a new foundation for the farm.

In the last scene Jacob goes to pick minari with David showing that he is now more humble when before he was pretty dismissive of the idea of planting it and also showing that he has grown.",lnwli1
gpv9p1y,"In one of the interviews with the director, it was mentioned that he had intended to have narrations (by grown up David) to bookend the movie. I was glad he decided against that idea ultimately. Because that would have made this story too specific to David’s POV. 

The movie ended just right. Lots of details in the last 10 minutes will answer the questions... this movie deserves a second viewing. I did see it again and it got better.  Without ruining the ending, these are things I noticed that might give closure to the fellow audience who felt the ending was not enough: David’s *running* towards grandma, Jacob’s watching Monica’s emotion, the way Jacob’s holding his family while sleeping on the floor, grandma’s final look, Monica’s approval of the well, and of course the harvesting of MINARI.

The director also said in a Q&A that he wanted audience to figure out what MINARI means and even how to pronounce it.  He also mentioned the destructive nature by water then fire was somewhat blibical.  

I also read the original screenplay and it mentioned Jacob waited for Monica’s blessing to dig the well, and that Jacob puts the rock down like a “pillar”. Also there was a scene that was cut where grandma saw the kids on the swing before dinner.  When Monica and Jacob come to collect the kids, David wanted to follow dad; they made a detour to harvest the MINARI.  Hope these help.",lnwli1

During the fight outside the store Monica said, ""You chose farm over family"" and that was why she was ready to leave him for that.  And when they get home and see the fire, Monica risks her life to try to help save the vegetables.  And then Jacob chooses family over farm when he gives up trying to save anything else when he can't see Monica.  In that moment, they indeed ""saved each other"" which is all they were looking for the whole time.  The final piece snapping into place was David running and asking Harimoni to come back; this after spending much of the movie telling her that she's not a real grandma and that she should go away.  

After that, the coda shows us the father and son walking to the creek and finding that the foreign minari plant has taken root and is flourishing.  That's really all that's needed to be said.",lnwli1

It’s just so crystal clear at the end that the family is gonna stay together, they’re gonna try again and they will learn to thrive in their new environment just like the Minari.

goju9ig,"Watched it with my parents and they had some criticisms (but they are picky AF and seem to generally dislike movies or TV shows with Koreans and Korean-Americans because they notice all the tiny inconsistencies)...plus, they are still Korean so have a certain level of pride and saving face, so for some reason, they seem to find the Koreans in Minari and Kim's Convenience to be embarrassing/shameful and not representative of Koreans. They literally were like, ""why wasn't the movie about some successful Koreans? Why are they making us look bad/embarrassing?"" -\_- lol

&#x200B;

One of the biggest inconsistencies is language...they felt like the Korean was awkward/imperfect? in terms of how the sentences were structured...they also thought it was unbelievable that the kids would use 존댓말 so perfectly or consistently. Usually Korean-Americans, if they know/speak Korean, tend to speak in Konglish with the parents.

&#x200B;

Steve Yeun's Korean is good but he definitely has a gyopo accent. It's SO hard to get rid of so  I don't blame him. His Korean is still WAY better than like Daniel Dae Kim (who is just painful to listen to). I thought his Korean in Burning sounded better but I know he also spent a couple of months in Korea before filming that so it probably helped.",lnwli1

Even today, ill still speak to my parents in English, but they'll respond in korean (although there's a lot more English now). I think it has to do with the fact that it's generally easier to understand a language versus having to come up with sentences yourself due to the way that language comprehension works.

go6is9a,"Paul is a quirky guy, and like the Yi's, a bit of an outsider himself. It's clear that religion is also a huge part of his life. Jesus Christ carried a literal cross to the place of his crucifixion. On Sundays, Paul isn't seen at church with the community, but is instead seen carrying a literal cross alone. The phrase ""carry your cross"" is not meant to be taken literally (and can be interpreted in different ways by different christian circles) -- but essentially, it means to suffer, deal with your burdens, figure out your problems, etc. I thought that showing Paul carrying a literal cross was to demonstrate how he worships on Sundays in his own way, and to possibly foreshadow that the Yi's were about to suffer (more). ",lnwli1

icz9ktt,"I just watched the film. I dont think it felt very ""Christian"". I think it more reflected the relationship a lot of korean immigrants have with Church and Christianity in general. The line from the Korean lady in the chicken hatchery tells a lot and is very relatable for many Korean Christians who left church due to all of its issues. Another thing very relatable with Korean Churches is that Christianity is also used as something that the family really only went to in times of desperation/need, whether it be social (in the case of the mother longing for friends and a social life), financial (putting in a large tithe as an act of desperation for the success of their farm), or physical (going to Paul to ""exorcise"" the home to hopefully ward off whatever was causing their problems/heal the grandmother). This is also made evident by the fact that the family also decided to trust the hokey water finding method. To me, it was more of a manifestation of how desperate they were, to go to something/someone intangible to save their difficult situation",lnwli1

It's pretty noticeable when you compare Stephen to the actresses that play the wife and mother (who are native Koreans who live in Korea).

I'm watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8IyCyJXSGk) interview with Bong Joon Ho and Young Yuh Jung (grandmother). It looks like Stephen had language teachers during the filming.

gojy4e3,"> As for the ending scene with him and his son gathering the actual Minari, man I'm not too sure what that meant...

I think it was the grandmother that described the minari as a resilient plant. Can grow anywhere. Can thrive in harsh conditions. I think it was intended to symbolize the family in a way. 

I saw this film months ago, so my memory could be a little foggy, but I think the last scene in the film shows the son and father by the creek picking the minari, and the father off-handedly mentions just how well the minari is growing. 

I think it was the movie's way of telling the audience that no matter what the family went through or will go through, they will thrive because they are resilient in the face of hardship.",lnwli1

How did the grandma take on David's burden? I get it for symbolism sake, but how was it literal?",lnwli1
gok9309,"So I think what bothers me about the film when I think about it is that I'm not really sure what Monica wants, exactly? I guess the movie is more about Jacob's journey, but I feel like Monica gets the short end of the stick both in the story and by the story.

Within the story, she's not really happy about the rural life, and in the end she still stays in it?  And on a meta level, the movie doesn't really show enough of why she's feeling what she's feeling.

I think the best explanation is that, like you said, Jacob saw the farm more as his personal project, where he maybe brings in his son at times, in perhaps a bit of a toxic masculinity way, and in the end he lets the rest of his family in more, particularly the women, with his wife at the water dowsing*, and with his mother in law with the minari.

It reminds me a bit of Fresh of the Boat, where the actors pretend to be immigrants when they are Americans. The fake accents and bad Chinese in that show ruined it for me.

After proficiency is achieved accents will vary greatly, and be influenced by a variety of factors including family, friend groups, and personal preference.  I’ve taught many siblings and have seen a brother retain a thick accent while the sister had virtually none.

I’d say the only disagreement I’d have with your post is the phrasing of “perfect English”.  For me perfect English has nothing to do with accent.  In the US there are dozens of specific regional accents.  Perfect English is listening, speaking, reading, and writing the English of your area, which even includes knowing local slang and idioms, at a level where you’re not creating miscommunications due to a language barrier.

Edit:  to comment further on the other comment of some individuals never speaking English with proficiency, that is very common as well.

In the end, after the fire, each of them realized that yes they had different visions of how to live as a family and they had very different projects but they were not the personal obsessive and egotistical projects that each perceived the other to have (that was especially the case for the wife towards the end and how she viewed the farming project as an obsession taking precedence over family in her husband's priorities, after what he said at the hospital). In fact, the very divergent project each of them had was simply the way each of them could conceive of a good life for them as a family. It doesn't get discarded with a click of a button, not when you've invested all of your energy, belief, and probably almost entirely your being for a number of years into its realization and it bearing the fruits it promised to bear. The father was never going to walk away overnight from a plan that seemed still very much active. I don't think it's a simple ""which is more important now"" question. He probably absolutely still wanted both things as he answered his wife harshly at the hospital, but knew he couldn't control what she chose to do.

In any case, the fire cleared everyone's vision: its first effect was to drive everyone in a separate direction: the grandmother walking away into the distance in shock at what she caused, the dad going after his crops, the mother could have stayed out of it with the kids... For a moment it was possible that they were just all losing eachother. Then there was the reaction of each member of the family realizing that they don't want that kind of disintegration and that being safe again as a whole family was the most important thing in that moment.

So from that point on, everyone is back on the same page again on that front after it wasn't clear that they were. So they can then start finding ways to coexist again in terms of all the other things where they're NOT on the same page, and necessarily never will completely be, because well that's a family by definition as demonstrated so acutely throughout.",lnwli1
gqzbhxp,"For me, the fire was too cliche. Saving each other from dying in a fire does not prove you care for someone deeply. It just means you don’t want someone to die because more vegetables will grow in a few months anyways. Nothing about their relationship changed fundamentally. They just wasted a year of time and all that money on the crops and have to repeat it. The husband will still invest all his time in the farm, and shitty Arkansas farm life will still be the same.",lnwli1

gqkwiho,"Nice. Yeah I didn't mean literally perfect English but good enough where I don't hear an accent. I grew up with a lot of Japanese friends at an early age and some progressed faster than others. I had friends that were speaking almost perfect by 5th grade and others that still had heavy accents by 12th grade. Depends on a lot of different factors. I had a friend that only listened to gangsta rap as a kid and he spoke almost perfect kind of ghetto English but moved back to Japan in 6th grade. A few years ago I visited him in Japan and he messaged me like I haven't spoken much English since grade school don't mind me. First thing he says when I saw him was like ""yo what up bro what's the deal"" haha. It was great. Still spoke exactly how we did when we were kids trying to act cool.",lnwli1

gpta5ev,"My issue is with the last 20 or so minutes of the movie. Out of nowhere we get


-buyer for vegetables
-kid is cured
-fire in the barn
-hire guys with divining rod (but fucking why?)
-then we get them picking the minari

More happens in these last 20 minutes than happens in the rest of the movie. And none of those things listed lead to any type of realization or conclusion. It seems like something could have been said at any one of these points. -kid is cured (because of the farm life) -hire divining rod (because they realize the rod is bullshit and the people just know how to find water really well) -pick minari (have a korean plant to sell to the grocer until they can regrow crops)

So it ends up being us just watching a movie about people living their every day lives. Okay, that is cool, but how is it any different than the shit me or you go through on a daily basis? Their farm may be done, it may still flourish, but who cares, it is just a movie that has ended and is over forever. We will never come back to it and a sequel to this would seem silly. If this was the first season to a tv show it would be great. But this is an open and shut movie.",lnwli1

gqzh13z,"Interesting, the dialogue for IB is in English for approximately 42% of the running time, in German for 28%, in French for 22%, and in Italian for 1%. 

English is still the dominant language in the movie tho. English is certainly not the dominant language in Minari.",lnwli1
gqzj1sp,"yeah lol it’s been a few years since I’ve seen it. IB was ~42% English by run time, 28% German, 22% French, and 1% Italian. 

I guess what tipped the scales was that it was about Jewish American soldiers going to Europe to fight & it wasn’t talked about as a movie about German or French representation in American cinema. 

I think the real snub is that Foreign Language precluded Minari from being nominated for some of the other Golden Globes. Also, it certainly makes us all re-evaluate what exactly makes a film a ‘foreign film’.",lnwli1
go6cohl,"I think that may have something to do with the fact that it takes place in America. It’s a wholly American story, but it’s still a foreign language film.",lnwli1
go7l899,"Given a two second google search, Inglorious Basterds is “roughly 30%” in English, so that rule could absolutely still hold true.

gvzmbou,"I agree - the end was what made it an ""okay"" movie. Just because the barn burned down doesn't change anything that Monica was struggling with in Arkansas, in fact, it probably would make things worse in terms of financial recovery, etc. So what, you're supposed to just loose yourself to this dream and problems are supposed to sort themselves out? Sounds like some plot holes. The movie was good in some ways, but this was weird - her attitude completely changed. And you don't even know if that's really what happened because it's super subtle and like other people said, rushed!",lnwli1
gwqu29b,Immigrants especially. Given most first generations started from close to nothing.,lnwli1
gqzjg7m,"I think it’s a bit tricky here because the characters in this movie speak Korean because it is more *authentic to the story*, not because it is a *Korean film*. English is not the majority language, but to me, it was pretty clear that the target audience was English speakers, so I’m not sure if I’d say that English wasn’t the dominant language. The original script was even in English and was later translated to Korean.

But anyways, even though it does technically make sense for a film to be a “foreign-language film” if the most common language isn’t English, is this a useful categorization? I don’t think Minari (or Inglorious Basterds) would have been as effective if the characters had all spoken English. But, because Minari chose to tell a realistic story, it was punished - none of the actors were eligible for awards, and the movie wasn’t eligible for other main categories. HFPA made an exception for Inglorious Basterds. I think they should have done the same for Minari. Or even better, rethink these restrictions and what their purpose is.",lnwli1
gr0wwcg,"There's nothing to ""re-evaluate."" The fact of the matter is a number of other pictures that did not have more than 50% English dialogue were considered by the Golden Globes for best picture and/or weren't limited to the category of foreign language film. This includes films that didn't take place in the U.S., weren't about the American experience, weren't produced or directed by Americans, and didn't have primarily American actors. So what's the difference then? Why was Minari precluded but those other films were not? My contention is that it's because Minari didn't feature enough white people, or perhaps it's because it featured too many Korean people. The latter explanation, in particular, is consistent with the overall treatment of Asians in the U.S.",lnwli1

gsky072,Why did the fire do that? Instead of like the kid being cured.,lnwli1
i0nal1i,"I think some events have the capacity to make ppl come to terms with what's most important to them. They almost died in that fire. Monica was willing to risk her life to save his dream (ran in to help with the crates), and eventually Jacob was willing to let go of that dream (left the vegetables) to save his wife from the fire. ""They"" were the things most important to each other. Unfortunately, it took the fire for them see that in each other (prior, i don't think either of them really had faith that they were prioritized). 


And that possibly renewed both of their perspectives on how they would live life -- in a way that they both could be content with. Maybe he eased up a bit, and gave himself more space to be present with the family, and that helped her to feel a higher sense of support for what they were out to accomplish in Arkansas. 




Plus, maybe the doctor saying ""whatever you're doing keep it up"" came to mind.",lnwli1
gr0fvo7,"yeah that’s fair. I guess the real determinant is who’s the primary audience & for Minari, the answer is Americans.",lnwli1

gr89pck,"Yeah, I agree with you. I thought the resolution was rushed as well. The only thing that changed was that she ran into the shed to save his produce as well. They embrace crying and then it cuts to the scene where they search for water.
There is a beat missing, for sure. I don't see how a fire would make her change her mind.",lnwli1
gvf6fks,"I guess Jacob thought ""This is phenomenal but I need to provide a better living for my family rather than look at chick butts for the rest of our lives."" When the~~y~~ fire came and gave Jacob and Monica slap in the face physically and mentally, ~~they~~he prioritize family.

The ending is open ended. I'm guessing Jacob will stay with his family and abandon the farm if it is clear the farm choice is not working.",lnwli1
i8mnpxt,"Thank you for your analysis about the fire scene and the conclusion of the film. I was confused trying to figure out what--if anything--abruptly changed their feelings from their conversation behind the grocery market that had become hard set on separating, not staying together, and giving up even after the good news of their son's improving health condition and the better financial prospects of the new business deal. This insight has helped me understand the movie. Thanks.",lnwli1

gsxqlq4,[deleted],lnwli1
grw51go,"I'm a bit late to this, but I saw the end of the shed fire kind of proving his priority was still his family, even with him seemingly choosing the farm prior. When Monica collapses in the shed, Jacob goes to her and gets her out, and then stays out with her to make sure she's okay rather than going back and getting the multiple crates of produce the two of them had put near the doors. Considering in the scene outside the market she said she'd lost faith in him, I understood it as she saw he still cared deeply for his family and she was willing to try the farm idea again.",lnwli1
gvfvdct,What? That is not what happened. As the shed is burning he runs into the burning shed which can kill him to try and save the crops. At this time the grandmother runs away and the kids go get her. His family is in the middle of the woods at night or in the fire with him at this point.,lnwli1

grx1e39,"I mean, I guess I can see that... but that is some LOW bar for a relationship if ""everything will be fine"" is exemplified by ""he chose to save me from suffocating to death instead of saving his tomatoes"" 😂
One of my problems with the movie was that I never bought that they could make their marriage work, since she always seemed against his efforts from the start. They never gave the actress anything more to play except for the ""Wet Blanket Wife"" trope. I found it hard to root for them as a couple.",lnwli1
gvhl5rw,"Oh I worded that wrong. I meant Jacob seeing his kid's heart condition getting better as phenomenal. But he was still set on making the farm idea work until the fire came. When he was trying to rescue the fruits of his labor, his wife helping him and risking her life made him realize family is more important than savings the crops. The crops were important but family staying together was first.",lnwli1
gt57neo,[deleted],lnwli1
grxy6bm,"That's totally fair, I can definitely understand wanting more. I felt she was a good contrast of loving her family above all placed against Jacob's ambition and stubbornness to keep at the farm, and that the fire also had the two understand the other more, as Monica went to try to help save the farm while Jacob ultimately saved his family. But yeah, maybe could've done a bit more than just having him save his wife over some beets haha. I also may be giving the movie extra leeway since I really enjoyed it and connected to it, but I do bthink it's got some interesting complexities.",lnwli1
gvhpsx4,"Where? He kept saving the crops. Again this is why putting this stuff in the last 5 minutes are a detriment to this movie. And again defeats your point.

Give us the slow burn, give us a 2 minute scene of him sitting in front of the fire with his family and being okay with it, if that is what you are saying. 

We dont get that. We get BOOM! fire BOOM! happy family BOOM! minari.",lnwli1
